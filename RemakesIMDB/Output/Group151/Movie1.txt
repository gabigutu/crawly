		<shortDescription>This movie is really good if you're a complete moron</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Allow me to save you $8 by offering something you can do at home that is just as entertaining as watching this movie. Go get a load of whites and throw it in your dryer. Now, add in one red sock. (Make sure everything's dry so you don't end up with a bunch of pink laundry.) Now, hopefully you have the kind of dryer that has the clear window in front. If you do, start the load and watch the laundry spin around. Every time you see the red sock pretend to be scared.That's it. That's the equivalent to seeing this movie. As entertaining as watching your laundry dry and every bit as scary as a red sock.Others have already punched all the holes in the plot (or complete lack thereof) that are necessary. I won't beat that dead horse. As mentioned, the acting was completely mailed in. The CGI was hokey, stilted and throw in in a lot of scenes unnecessarily. This wasn't just a really bad movie, this was a really bad horror movie. Most horror movies these days suck to one degree or another, but this moving distinguishes itself as being among the worst of the worst. Seriously, save yourself the time and energy and steer clear of The Fog. I haven't seen a horror movie this bad since I saw the remake of The Haunting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I recently saw THE FOG and then read a lot of the reviews posted on IMDb about it. In my opinion, you people are being TOO easy on it. Can you rate anything BELOW a 1? Can I give a NEGATIVE rating to this film? And most of all, I'm writing Revolution Studios and demanding my money back. When you pay money to see something in a theater, I feel that there is a mutual and unspoken guarantee from the studio releasing it that the film will, at the very least, resemble something that LOOKS as if it were made by a group of people who know something about film-making. After seeing this, I would have to seriously question whether or not Rupert Wainwright has ever actually seen a film or if he's just going by what other people have told him ("Hey, Rupert, movies are really cool! You use this thing called a camera and it records people doing neat stuff! Doesn't that sound interesting?").I don't need to be insulted like this. The original FOG was a good, solid piece of horror film-making that generated its scares by making the most of a small budget along with great music and decent effects. The new one is a poop stain on the remake underbelly that Hollywood has chosen to embrace. I don't just hate this movie, I LOATHE it. I loathe it and everything that it stands for because what it stands for is taking your money and then kicking you in the balls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The WORST!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The worst movie I have ever seen (so far)! It deserves a "1," but I'm saving "1" for the movies they make when I'm 70 years old.I wasn't expecting much but I thought "at least it will have a few scary parts to grab me." WRONG! As far as I could tell NO ONE in the theatre was scared ONCE -- not even those teen girl screamers that are always at horror flicks. I think everyone was CONFUSED, not scared -- Why the two love interests for Nick? Why was Elizabeth envisioning the past? Why did no one comment on the one guy's face ROTTING? Why did no one care the priest was drunk all the time? Why did it matter that the statue was made incorrectly? Why did the ghosts resort to using GRAFFITI? (and why did they use what looked like paint?)WHY? WHY? WHY DID I PAY MONEY TO SEE THIS? Instead of paying for this, ask an eight-year-old, heck, make it a seven-year old to tell you a scary story. I GUARANTEE he or she will come up with a better plot, more realistic characters, and scarier scenes than this piece of garbage!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The biggest disappointment of the Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was so disappointed about this. When I first heard they were remaking it, I was worried, but gave it every chance to actually be good. It wasn't. Everything that was good in the original was ruined in this one. There was no "atmosphere" to it, it was just a bunch of overly-beautiful WB-age stars thinly acting out a poor script. The whole purpose of the lighthouse and Stevie Wayne was to present this feeling of isolation and loneliness...in the new one, they seem to rarely use the lighthouse at all. There are extra points in the plot that are unnecessary and... and, I can just go on and on. It was just horrible.Then, I tried looking at it not as a "remake" but just as a regular movie, as though I was seeing the story for the first time. But, you know what: it still sucks. It doesn't capture you. There are a few good scenes and shots, but overall I just kept wondering when it would be over. So much potential with a story and it just didn't work.Unfortunately, that's Hollywood today. Horror films can be well made at the same time. Maybe they should stop relying so much on picture-perfect actors and corny digital special effects and start focusing more on the story, the characters, the music (Lord, the original score added so much), and just making it entertaining! 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't angry about The Fog remake until I heard that it was going to be released by Revolution Studios, a company known to house crap movies. From then on, my hopes weren't that high, and they sank even lower when I saw the trailer. It looked to much like Boogeyman or Darkenss Falls rather than an atmospheric, imaginative, horror production like the original. The original Fog deserves to be a cult classic and is a great film, but I thought it could have used a couple of improvements. It was not John Carpenter's best effort, but it still was an 8 out of 10 movie. This remake had potential because it could have corrected some of the plot holes from the original. Not surprisingly, the modernized Fog created new loopholes in the story and in addition had a terrible script.The characters here were clichéd. The naive young girl who sees "horrible things" happening and who is befriended by her "hot ex-boyfriend". There is even a token black guy who serves as the "comic relief" for the film. Why can't they have black heroes in horror movies? Every character is seen in some state of undress, including Stevie Wayne, a mother of a young teenage boy named Andy, who struts around in panties in front of her son (I thought that was funny). I'm surprised Andy's old nanny wasn't shown strutting around in her undies while cleaning the dishes.The leper colony ghosts were not scary. They were all see through, and instead of a giant fishing hook, Father Blake carried a cane (WTF??), not for support while walking, but for a scene near the end of the film where flying glass shards contribute to the death of a character. Also, the fog in this film is all CGI, and is not nearly as menacing as the one in the original was.Father Malone's character in the original was a major contributor to the story, because he represented the sins of the founding fathers. In this one, he's just a stupid old drunk who has a minimal impact on the story and plays more like the typical "old lady who can see the future" kind of character. Also, why aim for a PG-13? It's obvious the filmmakers wanted to put some gore in this, and they did, because there were many deaths that involved people being maimed and/or set on fire, not necessarily in that order. Only a few more drops of blood and it would be R. There are two good things though. There is one pretty shocking death scene that was cool and there were some cool cinematography shots. The eerie image of the sailors on their ship in the fog gave me the chills. There was also a really creepy ghost who was only shown in shadows (you never saw his face) and who wore a top hat. It would have been interesting if they showed that ghost more, but alas, they shied away from it. And don't get me started on the ending. It's supposed to be a shocker, but it's extremely predictable. It also makes everything that preceded it make little sense. What was the point of that? Stevie Wayne's cheesy closing monologue was even cheesier than the concluding monologue in House of the Dead.Overall, this dreadful remake ran shy of where it could have won the race.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie ROCKED.......me to sleep.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read a few of the comments that have already been left, it wouldn't make much sense for me to add much more than has already been said. You've been warned: This is an hour and a half of your life that you will never, ever recover....and you will be irritated for it. ZERO chemistry between characters, sub-par acting at best, no story continuity, and, most importantly, NO SCARE FACTOR. I actually found myself chuckling through a few scenes that were supposed to be suspenseful. Terrible. With the technology available today, this had some serious promise to be an improvement over the original, but it failed miserably. Watch the original Fog.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid this movie at all costs.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this opening night and let me tell you. The first hour is so bad that at least a half dozen people got up and left. The lady behind me puked half way thru the movie as well (I think because the movie made her nauseous). The last 1/2 hr does have some cool cinematography but not enough to save the film from the horrible creation it is. Bad acting, horrible script writing, stereo- typical characters with less than 1-dimension. Leave well enough alone (the 1980 original). ___SPOILER BELOW____ The best (funniest) part of the film comes when the lead lady watches a videotaped segment of some murders and we see the hilarious reaction of guy who hid in the freezer. "Just chillin'" he was. :-)We also get an infamous horrible script writing one-liner "What's going on here?".... see if you can spot it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Plot?...completely lousy The acting?...HORRIFIC. The main actress was truly getting on my nerves... WE did not get to identify with any of the characters as many of them were completely pointless throughout the movie...I was actually hoping they would all die. Nothing really made sense and everything just happened so fast yet it seemed like it was never going to end. The ending was almost ridiculous and completely senseless (more so than the rest of the movie) I have never seen the first movie but if it's as bad as this one, I am glad I did not waste my time. This was dreadful and painful to watch... by far the worst movie I have seen so far. I've never seen so many people walk out of a movie theater. This movie should have not been released in theaters...or DVD for that matter... What a waste!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the news-it's scarier</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's name is synonymous with horror films. A few films were not well received, but he's gone on to develop a cult status. His movie The Fog was not considered a huge hit, but has become near and dear to many horror film lovers bloody hearts. So when it was announced that it was part of the rampage of remakes and sequels, half of those who heard rejoiced. They expected that better effects could make the film scarier. The other half of horror-files just shook their heads, expecting another disaster in film. What could a bigger budget and new hot young actors do to freshen it up? Would a bad episode of the Weather Channel really scare a new generation? I was one of the ones shaking my head, skeptical, but I gave it a shot.Two of television's young actors, Tom Wellington from Smallville, and Maggie Grace from Lost, star in this unnecessary update. The film tries to fill seats with promised SSA( Scares, Screams and Sex Appeal)- obvious from the quick cut trailer which shows typical horror shots AND a low shot of Maggie Grace in her underwear. The promises are never fulfilled. The remake keeps the same plot of the first movie. Apparently somewhere in Antonio Bay's history people have been wronged. Unhappy and looking for revenge, these people come back in the Fog around the town's anniversary. For some reason the film forgets to add the part which makes the audience care about the characters. You don't care if the living out run the Fog or not. With scary and prophetic statements like "It came back from the sea?.things always do" this movie provokes eye rolling and incredulous looks every five minutes. Nothing in this movie made it redeemable. Trying to add comedy, DeRay Davis, as Spooner, is just confusing. At the same time makes one wonder why he's the only person who isn't white in the entire town. The only way that anyone should sit through this movie is if it's being used as a form of torture. I recommend you tell them what they want to know and forgo the pain. I wish I had. Leaving a horror film shocked or scared out of your wits is a desired effect. What The Fog leaves you with is scary- you've just wasted over an hour of your life watching a needless remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>God, I hated this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always hold out hope for remakes because I actually like a couple of them. I liked the remake of TCM and Amityville, and for the most part I like the Japenese horror movie remakes (but lets all forget about the god awfulness that was The Ring 2). When I saw that they were remaking this into a PG-13 movie I wasn't that thrilled (however, I am not apart of the bandwagon that says all horror movies should be rated R and not PG-13. I think there are some great PG-13 horror movies out there).Even when I saw the first preview I was not excited about it. But I still held out hope because the original The Fog is one of the scariest movies I've ever seen, and not to mention, in my opinion, John Carpenters best movie (Halloween is a little to slow for me). Even if the movie would be bad, I figured that Selma Blair could at least carry some of it.Opening night I was there to watch and I was so shocked because, for the second time ever in a movie (the first was The Talented Mr. Ripley), I was dying to get the hell out of there. The movie was painful to watch and doesn't even hold a candle to the great original. I am not kidding people when I say that this movie was bad bad bad. Horribly bad. Its like the filmmakers just wrote down all the good things about the original and then threw them out.First of all, I don't really need lots of blood and gore, and the original didn't have an excessive amount (but it still scared the hell out of me). But this was just PG-13 ridiculousness. We rarely saw any blood or gore (or did we see any at all, it was kind of hard for me to stay awake), the guys in the fog weren't even actors in scary makeup but was instead really bad CGI that wasn't scary at all. I wasn't expecting much from the actors (minus Blair) to begin with but, OMG, Golden Rasberry Awards should be given to all who were involved. Even Blair couldn't' do anything with what she was given.***And what was up with the nanny (or aunt or whatever) getting choked by the hand through the GARBAGE DISPOSAL. Oh my GOD, yes ladies and gentleman we have stepped into the bad clichés that we often find in Friday the 13th or the later Nightmare on Elm Streets. There was nothing scary about that scene!!! We laughed at it and there should be no laughing in The Fog.And then, do I even need to bring up the STUPID love story as a subplot. That was just a god-awful addition to a bad enough movie. At the end when whatsherface goes and kisses the old ghost and then becomes one??? what the hell was that? It was like I was watching a bad scary movie only with Moulin Rouge type camera work (I'm referring to the 360 degree view we get of the kiss for those of you who have seen the movie).Shame on the people that had anything to do with this film. This could have been good. The filmmakers could have taken the original, fixed the rough spots that Carpenter had in the film and maybe tweak a few small things, and they could have had Grade A movie. But no they had to go and modernize it and have it primed and ready for the high school crowd who probably don't even know this is a remake. I've seen the box office results for the weekend and they are not pretty so maybe Hollywood will finally catch on that we actually want good "scary" movies and not cheap knockoffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can take "the fog" and blow it out of you know where</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Today's forecast is foggy with a 90% percent chance of EVIL!! The Fog is one of those films that just make you feel like trying to figure out what the guy behind you had for dinner. This remake of another 1980's version just doesn't make the cut at all in my opinion. In fact it falls several meters short. The basic premise here is that there's a small fishing town who's founding fathers committed a terrible crime and now vengeance is being sought in the form of a killer fog.Think about that for a second A KILLER FOG!!!!! Does that sound scary at all!?!?!!? It's not as if you could possibly go into a movie about killer fog expecting to come out crying (unless you cry when your extremely bored). From a horror movie point of view this movie is more akin to an episode of Everybody Loves Raymond. It's just not scary at all you can spot every single little BOO from a mile away. On top of that it doesn't even make sense!!! I don't want to spoil anything here (because I know you're all just burning inside to drop whatever your doing and go see this film) but things just happen in the movie that don't even make sense at all!!! And you think they'll tie in later but they don't!!! Maybe they're setting up for "The Fog 2: Thicker Fog"? The movies only saving graces are some hot actresses, and Superman. Actually no, not even Superman could save this god forsaken kitty litter of a film.To put a cap on things I would rather be decapitated with safety scissors than see this movie again. Please if you go to see this movie make sure to wear adequate protection,and you might want to book your therapy appointment before you go. They're a little bit backed up these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible Revisit to a Horror Classic (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar in structure and specifics to the original "The Fog" movie, this one fails horribly. The first movie was creepy, eerie and ultilately terrifying because of what it doesn't show you, what it leaves shrouded in either mystery or off camera shots. We are given tight shots of the CGI ghosts who look fanciful, complex and ultimately not scary at all. The original all we see are shadows and for one gruesome moment, a maggot ridden face.We are also entreated to fragments of narrative that illustrate and retell the tale of Antonio Bay's forefathers betraying and murdering Blake and his band of lepers. Again, i say we are shown too much. The original, this tale of woe is shared via a decrepit old journal, we are left to imagine a scenario that is far more sad and disturbing when pondering the fate of the crew of the Elizabeth Dane.The film also fails by demystifying and disempowering the fog. Early on we are introduced to the "token black guy" who's zaniness and antical behaviour saves his life on more than one occasion, and whose wit is peppered through out the movie totally killing any chance of a good fright flick. When recreating an iconical early scene of the original, everyon on the Seagrass are killed, in this movie, the fast acting black guy survives by hiding in a freezer. Only to be framed for the murders of the other people aboard, a plot loop that never tries to resolve itself.Another scene, the female protag is hanging out in a morgue (an access apparently readily available to all walk in traffic of a hospital) filled with 3 not one of the Seagrass victims. The original treats us with a creepy where we see a blurred out or cropped out figure rise from the bed and attack her, in the revised version, we see the dead body crystal clear making the scene all the less scary.The method of deaths was also something of a cop out. with one exception, everyone is undone or killed by accidental elements around them... being set afire, killed by glass shards, or a knife flying through the air. The menacing element is no longer singularly personified by the killer ghosts of the original.Finally the movie tries an ill fated stab (no pun intended) at an overused ghost cliché, that of beautiful heroin falling in love with patriarchal lead ghost. the aforementioned cliché is used in the last few moments of the story, and quite literally comes out of nowhere. It is used as a catalyst to wrap up an otherwise terrible movie.On it's own this movie simply falls apart. As a tribute to an original masterpiece, it is even more tragic. Bad bad bad, I cannot recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They destroyed a classic horror flick !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I should have known better before paying money to go see the 2005 remake of The Fog starring TOM WELLING and rated PG-13!! For me, the Fog, was a cult classic I used to love when I was a kid. The scary, eerie small town with a dark secret, the ghostly figures in the fog and the brutal way the townspeople got slayed in, contributed to a great ghost/horror story that was both exciting and enjoyable. Unfortunately we live in the "era of the remake" and naturally they had go screw this flick up as well. The small eerie town is replaced with a totally un-scary town, the fog looked like something pulled out of "the perfect storm" w/ George Clooney or "the day after tomorrow" (which is no surprise since it was the same company who handled the FX on "Day after..."), Selma Blair was trying to hard to fill out the role of Stevie Wayne and it seemed awfully fake at times. One thing that really got me cracking was the black guy/comic relief. I couldn't really figure out what the hell a black dude was doing in a small (all white) fishing town anyway? (if U ask me he was totally misplaced in the movie).In overall they actually managed to turn, what could have been a great horror movie into a teen/slasher/ring-knockoff!!The same goes for the moody "Carpenter music" that was replaced with the standard PG-13 b*llsh*t pop-rock soundtrack, it basically stripped the movie from having any tense atmosphere. The script was horrible, there where no scares and no mood at all, instead of cooking up a better "FOG" they actually made it worse, I find it incredible that despite having the technology to make some visually nice horror flicks today and correct some of the flaws that were caused by lack of money or technology back then, the studios are still spitting out nothing but trash... PEOPLE what makes a movie is a good story and HEART not Special FX (a principle Carpenter used to work with back then when the funds were limited...even still the man still made some of the most memorable horror movies in my lifetime). The ghost looked like something out of Pirates of the Caribbean and the only moment I thought "hmm...that's actually cool" was when you could see the big ship and the crew's ghostly figures standing in the fog, kindda made me remember back to the original, unfortunately things only went (even more) downhill from there...I mean WTF is up with the ending!?!?! I thought it was supposed to be a horror flick? In overall: If U are a fan of the original Carpenter movie, DO not see this cr*p, almost no gore, no feeling with the characters (actually you couldn't care less if they all got killed...), no mood, no eerie music, bad CGI, and the list just goes on and on... my advice: Rent it on DVD or even better wait for it to be aired on TV!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake a classic and turn it into a piece of boring dreck?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The grave robbers of Hollywood, completely devoid of new ideas, have taken to the graveyard once again to dig up classic movies of various directors to help their sagging box office.This year's director of choice is John Carpenter. We've seen a bad remake of "Assault On Precient 13" already and now comes "The Fog". Originally, it was a well crafted tale of suspense, horror and shock with a minimal amount of blood and gore, relying on the talent of Carpenter and his usual team of actors such as then wife Adreinne Barbeau, Tom Atkins, Jamie Lee Curtis and mom Janet Leigh, et al and spun a great ghost story.Along comes the remake squad with the latest in teen idols like "Smallville"'s Tom Welling, a load of digital effects and generous amounts of blood, gore and bad acting to deliver a hot steaming plate of manure shoved down our throats between handfuls of stale, overpriced popcorn.Message to Hollywood. There's a reason that your profits are tanking. Leave the classics alone unless you've got something better to do with it. So far, you're failing miserably!!!</fullReview>

In the beginning when the founding fathers are escaping, one of them is pulled in the water, we never found out what happened to him. The director and writer never explained why the ghost ship's captain goes after Elizabeth. He never explains how she is connected to the damned crew. Revolution studios owes an apology.Poor Tom Welling, he should have pulled out of this thing once he read the script. Not only is it hard to go from a nitch TV show to the big screen, it will be even harder with a disaster on your resume'.It was too awful for words, but these are a few.

		<fullReview>Remakes are rarely worthwhile, but this one is unusually terrible. If you liked Carpenter's original, avoid this like you would the spectres who emerge from the 'fog', and the leprosy that afflicts them. Acting is sub pop video, and character development laughable, particularly the rubbish about the relationship between 'Elizabeth Williams' and her mother. Also, rather than being aimed at a discerning horror audience - people who liked the original maybe - this film is seemingly targeted at libidinous teenagers, with some very dodgy and obvious shots of the female stars scantily clad. By the end of this tripe, I was hoping one of the fog dwellers would put me out of my misery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a huge horror movie buff, so is my husband. We rented the original to freshen our memory before we watched the new one. I realized it was going to be different, updated; but not that different. The story was completely different, they changed the legend. I was ready to walk out of the theater 15 minutes into the movie. It was so predictable! I didn't "feel" Selma Blair's performance like I did w/ Adrienne Barbeau. It felt like she knew what was coming. She wasn't the only one: not a single actor was convincing. It was horrible! They changed the story too much, there was too much fog at times. Yes, I know it is a big part of the movie, but they just over did it. There was way too much spotlight on parts of the story that were not relative. I didn't like the fact that you could see the detail of the ghosts, like their faces. The unknown is better to me, like in the original.~ Amanda Harmon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter, Come Back!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Actually, there were a few good things about this movie. Unfortunately, the best thing about it was the preview for RENT that ran just before it.And the British Columbia settings are awesome. I can see why my wife's parents made the trip from Texas to British Columbia three times and would happily go again.First and foremost it's not scary. There's not a single character developed well enough to care.Worst of all, it just doesn't make sense. Just who IS Elizabeth Williams? MAJOR SPOILER HERE, not that anyone would care. Here, she's a direct descendant of one of the townspeople who many generations ago betrayed the lepers on the ship. Or is she somehow a descendant of a woman on that ship whose corpse we see sinking to the bottom of the ocean. Was that woman Elizabeth Dane, or is the modern character being named Elizabeth just a coincidence.Is the town called Antonio Bay? That's what's on the town hall and Nick's boat. Is it Antonio Island? That's what Stevie calls it on the radio and what the sign at the power station says.Stevie has a radio station in a lighthouse and programs alternative rock. But she's the only dj. The station is on the air when she's there and off when she's not. And we never hear her run any ads. Where does she support herself and her child and afford a housekeeper? And who listens to her station? The population of Antonio Bay/Island seems to be primarily people over the age of forty except for the main characters. And why does she leave the lighthouse (with its sturdy metal doors) to drive into town? The original utilized the lighthouse setting so well.Every once in a while there's a car crash. Why? Did the director get confused and think he was remaking SMOKEY AND THE BANDIT? This is such a tiny island it's hard for vehicles to get up enough momentum for a really good crash.The town looks to be big enough to have a population of about 15- 20 thousand people. There's one black character, and he came from Chicago. Why? Nick is the main character, sort of the hero. But all he does is drive people here and there and near the end of the movie he drives to Stevie's house to rescue her son. The actor gets top billing but his character has no real function other than transportation.The director had previously made STIGMATA, a movie that had very few supporters. Why entrust this project to him? The man cannot direct for beans. If the pace of the movie hadn't been so glacial I wouldn't have noticed how inconsistent the storytelling was. The Director's Guild of America should bar him from ever going near a camera again.And the main question is, Why didn't they hire John Carpenter to direct this? He hasn't been all that busy since GHOSTS OF MARS and he could have contributed a script that would bring the whole project together. Carpenter is one of the few directors whose name on a project is in and of itself enough reason for me to go see it. Except GHOSTS OF MARS. Loyalty only runs so far. Heck, he's a grown man. Maybe he'd have gotten Adrienne Barbeau to come back to play Stevie. I'll bet she still looks good.Come back, John. We need you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't see a PLOT in The FOG</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, I didn't know they were still allowed to make garbage like this. But our final remake of the summer doesn't disappoint, it screws up like all the others did. The difference? If you haven't seen the original, then you'll have no clue whats going on. So lets get this straight. 1. One of the main characters is a RADIO DJ In a Lighthouse...OK. but she has no sponsors, or other means to support herself. So her income is...nothing? And some weather-guy is semi-stalking her, though you KINDA get the idea he could be her ex. I mean, she has a kid, but there's no back-story on that. 2. Now we have Elizabeth, the blonde girlfriend of the Smallville kid (who has been sleeping with the radio dj chick apparently). The way these two meet up in the beginning is ridiculous, their sex scene is just a makeout-scene for 10 yearolds. Now APPARENTLY, Elizabeth never felt 'at home' in the town. I'm NOT surprised. Between the homeless metal-detecting weirdo, the creepy drunk preacher and everyone else who lives here, I'd leave to. The Car Accident where she ends up 50 feet from the car is amazing btw, considering she stays in the car and just "appears" far away later. Oh, and it turns out that somehow, though she's of the bloodline of the town's founders, she's the reincarnation of the wife from a leper colony that was killed/burned on their own boat years ago. 3. Now we come to Superman. Someone shoulda stuck to Smallville acting. He serves NO purpose in this movie. he is a TAXI basically, for the two girls running around accomplishing nothing. He doesn't figure anything out, has no important lines and just has every vehicle he owns smashed and beaten on.Don't see this movie. Its just frustrating to watch. A preschool play would have more substance, better acting and a definable plot. This has NONE of the 3. This movie is sure to make the 5 dollar DVD rack at Wal-Mart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a disgrace to movies. The plot is wish-wash, the characters are one sided, naive, and completely random and oblivious to situations. One scene they will be having a fit, the next they are calmly walking around in a thick blanket of fog, which moments earlier tried to kill them. Honestly, the original for this was filled with suspense, and chills and everything you would want in a horror. But not this one, I've jumped more at Ernest scared stupid. Honestly anyone who has seen this movie and enjoyed clouds of smoke with people in it killing people in unrealistic and ridiculously over used ways, a truck is on its way to remove you from society.So to sum it up: Do not see this movie Do not let loved ones see this movie If you see someone that saw it and liked it, please punch them in the stomach, they earned it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the absolute worst remakes in all of cinematic history. It wasn't even remotely scary, nor was it creepy or believable. The acting on all fronts, even from Tom Welling, was sup-par at best. There wasn't any sense of horror or fear from any of the actors. If your town were being gobbled up by an unknown fog that killed people, I think you'd be panicking a little bit. But no, they're driving around and such, making complete donkey butts of themselves (I'd use other words, but expletives are prohibited). The ending, ha! Overall it just wasn't good. Poor remake, and shame on John Carpenter for allowing Hollywood to botch what was a good flick. It boggles my mind that he was even interested in seeing a remake of The Fog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>than you usually do on Smallville, then you will be gravely disappointed. There it is. I know that more than one person attended this movie just because Tom was in this film, and I was one of them, but this film is a stinker folks. You do not get to see more of Tom than you do in the average Smallville football shower scene or in one of the usual sequences when he somehow loses his shirt and the bad guys tie him up.The love scenes he is in during this movie are not believable, because though the boy has the face of an angel he simply cannot act. His love interest Maggie Grace can't act either which also constitutes a problem, because two bad actors make a love scene even worse. He has much more chemistry with Michael Rosenbaum.Other have done a fine job pinpointing the flaws of this film as a horror flick. The special effects are not bad but the story is sorely lacking. There are no scares here. The great thing about the original film was the slowly escalating tension created by fear of the fog. I realize this was created by a truly talented cast which was able to let us see their emotions. This film does not have that type of talent. I was only scared one time during the entire film.Spoiler: The ending was terrible, it seems like they did not know how to end the film so it just stopped. Maggie Grace winding up with a really old looking guy - WTF? Some loser who is way over the hill must have written that particular ending. Blake should have been hot looking at the very least, but he looked like Maggie Grace's grandfather. I deserve my money back for the ending alone.This is a perfectly fine future rental option, if you lower your expectations to the floor and have absolutely nothing else to do. I, however, paid $16 for a ticket and refreshments, gave up time I really could not afford to give on a Saturday afternoon and got little in return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake tones things down for a more teen-friendly spookfest, which might have been OK if it had been spooky. Unfortunately you'll find more scares in a Scooby-Doo episode. The opening sequence removes much of the mystery by showing us the backstory to Antonio Bay straight away. Among the cast, only Selma Blair seems to be trying hard, but she just doesn't have Adrienne Barbeau's presence. Changes to the story don't work at all, especially the final moments involving Maggie Grace's story. The film ends on a whimper instead of a bang. Although this maybe a blessing, as a PG-13-friendly version of the shock ending of the original would probably only further the contempt many feel towards this flick. Probably the biggest flaw though is the sense of blandness throughout the film's running time. Scenes that worked well in the original come off as poorly staged in the remake. For good value for money, just watch (or rewatch) the original.</fullReview>

The have changed all the cheerfully characters from the original, into sexy actors like in all other movies from 2004 and forward. Too much sex, and that AWE FULL party on the boat! I mean, what was the point? Why did they even brought that into the movie? What have The Fog to do with that at all? Feel free to compare the original, and you will see what i mean.This is a completely demolishing of an old great classic within horror films. They're always talking about copyrights; and i think they should do a law about making shitty re-makes. This film is a heartbroken creation; a wreck that should be laid to rest on the seabed for all eternity. Thanks.</fullReview>

I got more than an hour in in and had had to go to IMDb. Maybe it would be like "The Mist" (now that was awesome). But the reviews confirmed my worst fears. It must be one of the most boring movies ever made? All that talent out there and they DO THIS? Is it some sort of tax dodge? I don't get it. I'll turn it off and, following another reviewer's idea - watch my clothes dry. Why did they make this? It's about as scary as the Muppets and everything is choreographed 15 minutes in advance. Watch the Muppets - or I dare you - "The Mist".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sadly there is no 0 out of 10 to choose for this - as it has nothing to award a 1 for. How I laughed walking out of the cinema recalling a quote from the director I read months before his 're imagining' came out. I don't remember the quote exactly but it was along the lines of 'this movie will bring the story into the present as lets face it the old one has dated compared to what we can do now'. You get the gist. Well done to the director I say. See thru ghosts! What next? I was expecting floating bed sheets with eyes cut out! Blake the main villain of the piece is now reduced to what you would see on a weekday teatime show for kids like eerie indiana and goosebumps. Its THAT bad. Nick Castle - a rough and ready, normal looking fisherman in the original is replaced with a 20 something hunk with the square chiselled features of a catalogue model. Elizabeth is now a size zero bimbo who takes to wandering around the house and then OUTSIDE in her pants. I guess something the director added to bring it into a modern audience? This film is terrible. it blows. It bites. I laughed at several points during this film and I've found episodes of Buck Rogers scarier and better acted. This director should never be allowed behind a camera ever again. It did provide me with something however. The answer to the question 'whats the worst horror film you have ever seen?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I'm getting too old (30 yo) for this kind of movies. Not that I have been into this kind of movie, when I was younger. But maybe I wouldn't have been that harsh on my judgement, if I was..say 15 or 16 years old.The movies goes into the category of teenage horror movie, where the plot is very predictable from the beginning. It goes into the mould, like the The Nightmare on Elm Street and alike. You have the small town, with the spoiled blond from a rich family (Maggie Grace from Lost, is reminding me of the spoiled blond..erh, Kelly?...from Beverly Hills 90210). She should have the award for overacting. And then you have the hero type kind of guy (Tom Welling). I think, he did a good job in the Superman series. But here, you get the feeling, that he wants to be anywhere else, but in this lousy movie. When he tries to look serious, he almost looks like he about the laugh his pants of. All the other characters in the movies, is alike stereotype, or cartoonish. It also fits the teenage-horror-movie-mould, because you have all the typical things, you see in teenage-horror-movies (Who said "Scream"(1996)?). The token black dude, with a streetwise talking', who get killed when he (and his buddy) are about to have sex with two chicks on a boat. But then the fog is coming from the sea, with some creepy ghost-pirates. And oh my gosh...they are getting killed. The fog with all the ghost-pirates inside, goes on terrorizing the small neighborhood. I must admit, I had to see the movie in tree parts, because, I got the urge, the take my dish wash, to paint one of my rooms, and have a snack. But I did it...I saw the whole movie. And it wasn't good. There you had it, you are warned. Ofcouse you should see movies like this, just to be entertained. It's not meant to be something thougfull. A night with popcorn, candy, friends,and the tube-kind of movie. But it's not even worth that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It broke all rules</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You are considering making a remake of a classic or filming a book? Here is a short guide for modern filmmakers planning such an endeavor:1. Special effects will not make up for holes in other departments. 2. Just because we live in PC times, does not mean that everything has to be politically corrected into absurdity. 3. If the original did not have a love story, don't even think of adding one. Squeezing romance into a story by force will baffle and alienate viewers. 4. Do not create new developments and plots without following them through or try to stuff too many holes made by the original, because otherwise you'll end up making a miniseries. 5. Pick your actors wisely. Chances are that today's YM coverboy/girl won't be remembered in 25 years for his/her brilliant acting.I'm sure there are plenty of rules that could be added to this list - rest assured that "The Fog" remake broke them all. Love between ghostly lepers, ineffable past-life flashbacks, way too much fire, bad CGI, lame acting and characters/plot that practically require knowledge of the original to follow their actions.Honestly? This movie seemed like a quick cash cow. Nothing more.Forget this and watch the original. It is old, but it has that barebones, no-frills ghost story charm that no amount of special effects, cardboard corpses and emotional complications can replace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's idea of horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Fog" directed by John Carpenter is quite dated when you go back and watch it now. It was never on par with Carpenter's best efforts (The Thing, Assault on Precinct 13, Halloween). However, the original is still a watchable film and Carpenter generally has a good grasp of how to make a horror/suspense movie.Along comes the remake, with a bigger budget and better special effects. The story seems simple to execute: atmospheric fog rolls in on a small seaside town. The fog harbors murderous ghosts. How can this not be at least a little scary? Well, leave it to Hollywood to screw it up.This movie falls perfectly into the category of Hollywood "bubblegum" horror. We have lead actors chosen for the role solely because they are really good looking. We have an overuse of special effects that becomes distracting and ridiculous. There is violence, but it's always kept pretty mild as we don't want to offend anyone...ever. There's a complete lack of atmosphere and tension. It's more like an episode of Dawson's Creek with a little ghost story thrown in.It's sad (an unbelievable) that the movie has actually gone backwards in comparison to Carpenter's original low-budget, mediocre effort. Hollywood cranks out movies like this constantly and then complains that the horror/suspense genre is dead when they flop at the box office. Every now and then, a good movie like "The Ring" or "The Strangers" sneaks through, is actually scary, and is a big success. You'd think Hollywood would learn a lesson from that, but apparently not.</fullReview>

To expand on the original story of the Ill-fated ELIZABETH DANE, the clipper ship of lepers that was trying to establish an isolated community on some prime Oregon (originally California) Real Estate. We got about ten minutes of sporadic flashbacks to Captain Blake and his doomed maritime colony...gratuitous flashes of potentially leprous individuals...many absurd off-camera killings. In short, it COULD have shown, using the technology Carpenter didn't have, leprous-ghosts seeking revenge; a flashback story behind Captain Blake, his wife and colony and the greedy, frightened '4' ancestors... But it didn't. And what in the heck was with the ending???What it did do, was take what was originally a well-fleshed story, with characters in peril...and turn it into a diseased, pustulant, rotting corpse that didn't even have the nerve to bombard us with gore, FX, or nudity to camouflage the dung-heap it was.

		<fullReview>I love the 1980 version of The Fog, love it. It's so creepy with the music, the setting and the fog itself. The Pirates looked cool and horrifying plus we never saw them fully, the darkness covering them really made them creepy yet cool. Although this film isn't one of John Carpenter's favourites I must say it's worthy of a classic.Now the remake, I wasn't expecting much from this film because I know remakes are never as good as the original only a few can be as close or even better than the original like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake.The plot is close to the first film with the ghosts returning for revenge on the descendants of the people who killed them but instead of the horror tone of the 1980 film we get more of a teen horror film with few scares. The fog effects are cool and make it look like it's alive and instead of the Pirates killing people with swords and hooks their more supernatural with using the fog to kill people.The pirates don't look too bad, they seem more ghost like than the original but we don't see them as much.Another difference is that Jamie Lee's character in the original now lives in the town and is going out with NIck Castle, another thing is that she is connected to the ghosts since in her past life she was married to Blake and he wants her again.Not as good as John Carpenter's original but if you want to see how different the remake is then go ahead, just don't expect any jump out of your seat moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How disappointing this movie was. Knowing John Carpenter's resentment for producer's meddling with a director's vision, I should have taken his Producer credit with a grain of salt.If there was anything that stood above the material of the original 1980 film, it was that Carpenter was a good director. It wasn't great but for a low budget movie it was made with flair (not to mention, decent and more mature actors - you know, GROWNUPS!!!).This version not only had bad acting, things that happen make no sense. How did Stevie Wayne end up in the water? Who rammed her car? Why was a boat in the middle of the road? Why did Mr. Machen pull himself into the water? How did Elizabeth turn into a ghost at the end? What the hell was going on here???!!!How about these pointless updatings? Why show what happened to the lepers 100 years earlier? Or better yet, why change the way the gold was stolen from them from a purposely (and ingeniously) guided accident to a hijacking? John Houseman telling the story in the first 3 minutes of the original was much more chilling than what I saw from any scene in this movie, particularly with the flashbacks to the - well, it's no longer a boat wreck, is it? This movie is but not the inciting crime in the story.I hated what was done to the Father Malone character, hated Stevie Wayne leaving the lighthouse, hated the scene on board the boat "The Seagrass"(that scene in the original scared the crap out of me).By the way - COULDN'T ANYONE THINK THINK OF BETTER WAYS FOR CHARACTERS TO DIE OTHER THAN BEING THROWN THROUGH WINDOWS? BOOOORRRRRING!!!!!!!!!I watched this movie in a packed Manhatten theater and instead of being spooked, the audience was laughing - LOUDLY - many times throughout. All I could do was shake my head in disgust and shake my pockets wondering why I made them a little lighter than they were an hour and forty minutes earlier.SOMEONE GIVE CARPENTER A GOOD BUDGET TO WORK WITH PLEASE!!! AT LEAST HE COULD DIRECT! WAINWRIGHT COULDN'T STARTLE A SLEEPING CAT AND THEY GIVE HIM A GOOD BUDGET TO ATTEMPT A SCARY GHOST STORY? Carpenter at the very least can provide a creepy atmosphere to his stories when he is at the helm. PUT HIM BACK WHERE HE BELONGS RATHER THAN JUST HAVING HIM COLLECT A PRODUCERS CREDIT AND PAYCHECK!!! George Romero got his chance with the currently under-appreciated "Land Of The Dead." Give Carpenter his chance to show he's still in the game. And for crying out loud - ENOUGH WITH THE REMAKES ALREADY!!! Except for an elite few (like "Dawn of The Dead") THEY SUCK!!!</fullReview>

It this is your idea of a good movie, then I'd hate to see what you consider "crap" as far as movies goes, because you don't know what you're talking about.Once again, Hollywood proves that it no longer is capable of coming up with an original concept, even for a remake, thus further convincing me that we have seen the best they have to offer, and it's all downhill from here...sad as that is. Let's see - that makes how many bad Hollywood remakes from former movies/TV shows over the past few years - too many to count by my reckoning.Not even Smallville's own Clark Kent (Tom Welling) can save this monstrosity from total destruction, and I wasn't too impressed with the 2 "pretty girls" either - back to acting school with the lot of you. Since this movie was apparently filmed on the coast of British Columbia, near the Vancouver area (near where Smallville is filmed), the people in charge would have been better off recruiting Lex, Chloe, Lana, Lois and Mom and Dad Kent to come on over and make special appearances in this show, which would have then meant we could have our usual Smallville-like "freak of the week" episode instead of this garbage, which probably would have been much more entertaining. And don't even get me started on the "hip-hop daddy" (what was he doing in Antonio Bay in the first place?), or Father Malone, or the vagrant hobo dude who got swept up in the mystery fog - I'm not even going to try and rationalize what parts those folks had in the movie, or why they were there in the first place.I'll give this movie a 3-rating, only because of a couple of good moments right near the end, but that's as generous as I can be. Wait for the video to come out - at least then you'll have something else you can do at home when this "stinker" has you bored to death after a few minutes. Go rent Carpenter's original from 1980 and enjoy what a "real movie" has to offer - you might just be surprised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original Was Better. Not Scary, Not Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping and praying that "The Fog" was going to be good and better then the original. Nope, didn't happen. Where the original film at least kept you on the edge at times, the new remake is very predictable. The story isn't any different then the first one. Ghost of a 100yr old ship come back to an offshore island town to get revenge for what was done to them by the founders of the island. Yes it's a remake, but at least add something original.The main problem with The Fog is, there's no build up or suspense. Even when it tries, it fails with the results. There are maybe 1-2 jump out of your seat moments and they aren't because of anything scary on the screen. Even the deaths are pretty weak, except for one, which you'll have to see for yourself. Then again, maybe not.The acting is drab and weak. Maggie Grace should choose her films more carefully. Coming from a hit T.V. show like "Lost" to make this crap is unforgiving. Tom Welling (Smallville, Cheaper by the Dozon) isn't going to set his film career ablaze with this film. A least this will be a learning experience for both of them. Selma Blair is the only one who at least give an admirable performance, but she really don't have much to do it this film.What the Fog does get right is, "THE FOG". The eerie mist has a mind of it's own and I loved the way the ghosts slipped around in the background. The fog is done very well, but everything else is way below average. There's just not enough scares and the story just won't hold people's interest for long, as it's been done before.Stay out of the fog and out of the theater for this one. Now I know why John Carpenter didn't want his name on this film. What a bomb.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me first say that I am so sorry to my boyfriend for having to waste his very hard-earned money on this completely horrible movie...ugh, I feel REALLY bad for being the cause of his eighteen dollar loss. Secondly, the only way that I could describe this movie to my friends was that it is comparable to a super-boring, totally lame, extra long episode of "Are You Afraid of the Dark." (And not to knock one of my favorite childhood shows...but we all know those story lines were hardly scary, and for the most part I never felt a connection to any of those characters, either.) Just bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. And third, CGI. Ha. What a laugh. The ghosts reminded me of the primitive Scooby-Doo pirate villains...(Did anyone see that South Park episode? The one with Korn?) Anyway...Lastly, the fact that I am able to connect this film with shows meant for children and South Park fans (who I happen to be, don't worry) tells you how utterly terrible the movie is. I never saw the first, and I've read mixed reviews for it; but after seeing this version, I really don't want to waste more of my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost in the Fog: Avoid this Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Fog" is nonsensical, non-thriller about a cheated, deceased crew of lepers whose ghosts return to a small N. Californian town, fronted by a dense, stalking fog, seeking to exact vengeance on the descendents of ancestors who violated a tenancy contract then robbed the lepers of their possessions before burning their tall ship at sea. The only positive note I can offer about this movie is that I went to a matinée (Glen Cove Theatre, NY) and only paid $5.00 to get in. Otherwise, this movie is bad for a variety of reasons.1. Predictable to a fault. Believe me, you've seen this one before in countless but instantly recollectible varieties.2. Poor attention to details. Many too many continuity errors. A car window breaks and then repairs itself in the next sequence. A table at shoreline is under water in one moment, fully clear of the tide in the next. A woman plunges into the ocean in full leather garb from head-to-toe, in the next scene she is dry as a bone. And on and on and on....3. Hack acting. The female lead, Maggie Grace, who plays Elizabeth Williams, has all the acting chops of a professional athlete making her acting debut. At points, she is almost unwatchable. Ditto for Adrian Hough, whose drunken Father Malone (how's that for predictable: a drunk, Irish pastor?!) plays to stereotype without adding one single nuance of his own devise.One wonders how such drivel gets funding when there are so many independent film-makers out there having to beg for a measly few thousand dollars to produce worthy, inventive films.Avoid this film. It's not even worth the matinée fee, nor worth your while renting or borrowing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unnecessary and Terrible Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Antonio Island, Oregon, the dwellers are celebrating the anniversary of the foundation of the seaside town and the mayor has built the statues of the founders: Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The descendant Nick Castle (Tom Welling) owns the Castle &amp; Son, a fishing charter company, using his vessel Seagrass for tourism in the Antonio Bay. When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island, coincidently a huge fog appears with weird noises and killing locals. When Elizabeth slips in Nick's boathouse and falls in the sea, she finds an 1871 journal written by a man called Blake, who bought half the island for his leper people to build a town for them to live. While sailing in the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane, bringing his community to Antonio Island, Blake is betrayed by Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The quartet locks Blake and his friends in the vessel, steals their money and possessions and fires the ship, killing them. In the present days, the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the descendants of the criminals.1981 "The Fog" is a dark ghost story of the master of horror John Carpenter, with great cinematography and special effects, giving a scary atmosphere without the need of gore. The screenplay builds the horror in a low pace, but increasing the tension.I decided to see this remake just because of the names of Tom "Clark Kent" Welling, Maggie "Shannon Rutherford" Grace and Selma Blair. In spite of my wish of liking this movie, unfortunately it is terrible. The story is basically the same, but the modifications in the original screenplay are awful and confused. The edition never reaches the tension, and for example, I have not understood why Elizabeth leaves Antonio Bay (and Nicholas Castle) with the ghosts, or the modification in the statue of the angel in the cemetery. The songs that the DJ Stevie Wayne presents in her station are the best this movie offers to the viewers. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "A Névoa" ("The Fog")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Debra Hill's ghost shall seek vengeance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rarely ever rate a 1/10, but I had no choice but to do it here. Debra Hill probably wants to return from the grave and take revenge on the film makers of this movie, just like the ghosts from this film. From the director who brought us such classics like "Blank Check" and "Stigmata" comes THE FOG...remake.First off, the 1980 The Fog isn't one of John Carpenters best, but it is still a good horror movie with great chills, cinematic directing, and a creepy musical score. Remaking The Fog was a risky decision, but it could've worked; the original was missing a lot of things, so a remake could piece them together to make an excellent horror film. For example: GORE. Despite an R rating, the 1980 film has very little blood. So a remake could've added the gore to make it even more cringe-worthy. Look at The Blob, the 50's version has no gore at all, but the 80's remake is basically the same film, just arguably one of the goriest films of the 80's. But no, the producers went with a PG13 rating here just for more money.The acting is bland, the writing is like something out of a SyFy channel movie, the CGI is hokey and laughable, the ghost sailors aren't scary whatsoever, and everything in between just sucks. The ghosts and fog are CGI, and it looks abysmal. The ghosts in the original were dark, mysterious, quiet, and had glowing red eyes that haunted your mind. Here, they just look like typical Haunted Mansion ghosts. Most of the time, we don't even see them, people just get attacked by nothing. The fog itself doesn't look as near as scary as the real fog in the original.The characters suck too. The originals' cast was played by ADULTS, who did ADULT things in ADULT situations. This time, 90% of the heroes look like they haven't graduated from high school yet, so we have TEENS doing TEEN things in adult situations, which doesn't add up. Every girl in the movie is hot, and has at least one skimpy dress scene. The love interest that the producers through in was terrible and pointless. We even have a token black guy for comic relief! Why does THE FOG need a comic relief black guy? Imagine if Halloween had a token black guy, or The Thing.Overall, this is by far the worst remake of a Carpenter/Hill film, and one of the worst horror films to be released in theaters...ever. The Thing prequel may have been disappointing, the Assault On Precicnt 13 remake may have been bad, the Halloween remake may have been even worse, but THE FOG takes the cake. I'll be waiting for an Escape From NY remake with an all teen cast, CGI explosions, and a token black guy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame, Dumb, Un-Creepy, Dysfunctional, And...... The Devil of all Horror Films &amp; Horror Remakes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film, As a Horror film and as a Remake it is the worse. Whether it falls in these three categories, The Fog 2005 is an awful adaptation of the 1980 John Carpentar classic.People complain about "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Friday the 13th" and even "Halloween" being remade, but I think that this is the devil of all remakes. This remake has no originality and even if I heard bad things about this remake, like all films i gave it a chance. i did and as the first 10 minutes rolled in, i just wanted this piece of crap to end.I'll talk through on what I think of the film.Acting, 3/10: Very poor and pretty useless and we can expect from modern horror films. The girl on the radio, Elizabeth &amp; The Smallville Actor try their best but they don't save this film at all. Aside from those actors acting terribly, The other actors do nothing to help and they are just plain and simple, with no character.Story/Plot, 0/10: What a messed up plot!? This plot doesn't work for me at all. In Carpentar's version it was all about a creepy ghost tale. It was about an evil atmosphere that would come on a certain night at a certain time after 100 years later. This remake's side of the story is very uninspiring. It's about 4 crooks burning a boat which has men, women and children. After they return 1000 years later to get revenge. It sounds like the same thing but it's that dysfunctional that I couldn't understand what's with that and this? Scariness, 0/10: The film is not scary at all. From start to end it isn't creepy. If you want scares go rent the 1980 classic because the kills and the atmosphere is more tense.Besides describing those things, I would like to describe the worse thing possible in the film that is unrealistic, overdone and not creepy whatsoever. The scenes of the Fog. When the Fog kills it is very unrealistic. When it kills, we see human hands grabbing people and we see that the Fog has cleared. When the Fog moves in and out of places it is done very quickly. It moves very fast and that gives us no tension or creeps whatsoever. Every scene with the Fog fails epically. It's not scary and it never creeped me out. I just sat there and said "Yep, really scary". The Fog in Carpentar's version is much more realistic because it moves in very slowly and that what gives it tension. And then when hands grab people, it's like the hands are camouflaged through the Fog to give off the nice effect.I didn't have hope for this film at the start and now I wish I had two hours of my life back because this version was very uninspiring. Nothing is pulled off well here. Nada....Even if Carpentar's The Fog isn't my favorite Horror film, I still think it beats the remake tremendously.1/10</fullReview>

But, I didn't see anything, maybe I was blinking with my eyes and missed the best part. To be honest. The beginning of 2000 up to today they are making remakes and admit it, they all suck. Well, most of them. But this one is a perfect example why not to remake a classic. Even on the cover of the DVD you could see that there wasn't a bloody shot in it. There wasn't even one scary moment in it. And to make it worse, the shower scene even didn't contain any nudity. When the 'ghosts' came on screen it did remind me of Pirates of the Caribbean. I even can't understand why it is rated for 16 and above her in our country. I could watch it with my 9 year old daughter. She would never be afraid of it. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This reattempt of The Fog suffers from classic remake hatred</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2000's have been a time when the horror community fuelled with rage and hate, as the mainstream film industry took over beloved classics such as "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "Halloween", "Day of the Dead" etc only to rehash them with modern film equipment and technology which usually insults the original film and its fans. Because of this horror buffs and film lovers in general, hesitate when a "Escape From New York" or "Fright Night" remake is in the works and typically it will be slandered as "one of the worst films I have ever seen". This 2005 remake of John Carpenter's 1980 film "The Fog"is listed as one of the worst, however when I watched it I didn't really see anything that wrong with it other than typical horror cheese and its lack in effective substance.Of course most horror films have cheese. When I watch the original "The Fog" (which I adore) I can't help but feel a little embarrassed when I see ghosts with glowing red eyes but that is all a part of the dating process so that isn't really anything to hold against the film. This version does the exact same only with cheap computer graphic ghosts and burning, rotting flesh ? it's cheesy and it dates a lot faster than effects from the 1980's. It really backs me up when I say the film industry jumped ahead of itself before truly mastering CGI whereas today we have films like "Avatar" and "Clash of the Titans" which do have quite impressive computer visuals. Other than these moments in the film which occur in the last thirty or so minutes, there isn't really anything too horrendous that the original didn't do other than its lack in atmosphere and scariness.What this movie was missing the most was suspense and thrills. It has a good opening, twenty minutes of opening shots of the island, the sea, crashing waves, fog horns etc. which create a serene, creepy setting accompanied by a particularly chilling piano score, only the film moves on from its focus on horror and atmosphere and moves into a series of events plodding around with uninteresting characters rather than creating any truly suspenseful scenes. Even when it's trying to create suspense and creepiness you can't help but care less as the characters are so plain and boring to watch.The acting is passable but it doesn't redeem the poorly crafted characters. We have pretty boy Tom Welling who has no character development at all, the script attempts it but not well enough. He is the main character and couldn't be more uninteresting and forgettable although luckily Tom Welling isn't a bad actor otherwise that would be a real problem. Maggie Grace is no better but fortunately enough isn't droll to watch on screen. Then there is Selma Blair who I really wish was written into the script more as she was the only person in this film I came close to liking; however as Stevie Wayne she doesn't quite cut it. Then we have the token African American comic relief; DeRay Davis's character "Spooner" which by the year 2005 this textbook joker should have left out of screenplays.Rupert Wainwright's remake of The Fog certainly isn't one of the worst remakes out there. It is quite cheesy at times but personally I found it stuck sensibly to the 1980 version rather than humiliating itself and insulting the original like many remakes do. It is a rather forgettable film as there are no overwhelmingly great moments, it didn't really go anywhere further than the original film did and the cast of characters are flat and have no substance - this movie is bland not bad. Still, there are far worse out there that deserve heavier criticism than this 2005 remake gets.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog bores its audience.The stars are young and pretty, but have nothing to do. The digital fog effects are virtually invisible--at least on an HD Broadcast to an HDTV. There are absolutely no scares and the story--though inspired by a cult-classic--is uninspired.If I had to guess, I'd say the screenwriter was a fourteen-year-old girl.Young "Brittany" saw The Fog with her dad on DVD when she was thirteen. She then used her extensive experience reading teen-romance-novels to help her craft this snore-fest. She also may have had some ideas for casting.I have to say I was concerned when my boy came in and sat down next to me shortly after The Fog started--these remakes sometimes ramp up the violence and gore quite a bit and he was a bit young--but I soon realized that it wasn't going to be a problem. I'd let an eight-year-old watch this movie--though I'd advise him not to.Dull, dull, dull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The coastal Oregion town of Antonio Bay is in danger, as a huge fog bank blows in harboring some revengeful spirits.Remake of John Carpenter's classic ghost film exchanges the subtle, creepy style of the original film for a bunch of CGI effects and a band of teen-pleasing actors. So I guess it's needless to say it just doesn't live up to Carpenter's classic. The 2005 version of The Fog falls into the cliché trappings of many modern horror flicks. The characters are thinly-written and are cast with actors much younger than those in the original film. The "scares" rely on CGI-created violence rather than on suspense or brooding atmosphere. On top of this the stereotypes are many and the film was obviously created to be pleasing to a certain demographic audience.With that said the remake does feature some decent direction from Rupert Wainwright and screenwriter Lew Cooper does produce an interesting, if flawed, re-working of the plot of the original film.So, is it as bad as people say? Well, it's no winner but I don't think it's as bad as such lame remakes as The Wicker Man 2006, Black Christmas 2006, When a Stranger Calls 2006, or Prom Night 2008.** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Really Isn't That Bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2005 version of "The Fog" is no classic, but it is not the total dump that everyone is claiming. I perceive it as no more flawed than any of the modern "horror" genre. In fact, I found it to be overall, eerie, poignant, haunting and visually effective. The cast all performed very well; no weak links. The production values were excellent. It was updated to current culture, and aimed at a youth market. I enjoyed the original "The Fog", and I thought this version traveled well with time. The director made a concerted attempt to create a haunting atmosphere in the film, and I believe he succeeded overall. There were good moments of fright, even if the development of the story was somewhat uneven. I thought that the focus of the tale on the tormented Elizabeth Williams was clever. It anchored the otherwise naturally- rambling story line. The actress carried the part exceedingly well. I was much impressed. There were other excellent and eerie visual efforts that worked too. I would have liked more immediately visible "ghosts", but cannot argue with the overall effect. As to what some were commenting on about the actors being too beautiful and "consistent"; the leading women in Hollywood have always been beautiful. The difference is that in recent times, women have found their métier in physical fitness. Female stars of yore had uniformly lovely faces, but their figures often did not match so well. I think the faces are still beautiful, but fitness endows one and all with a similarity of form. I thought each of the principle actresses in the film had unique looks, and excellent acting abilities. I had no trouble at all telling them apart. One element of many modern films is the similarity of wardrobe. Ours is now a casual culture, and in films everyone seems to dress alike. I think this mistake, more than any other, is the principle cause of a seeming similarity of actors. In the past, actors were given distinct "looks" with wardrobe. Today that important point is often neglected. When viewing any remake, I think it is important to not sit back and compare it scene for scene with the original, having a predetermined negative bias. Let the film stand on its own. Sure, there have been some pretty awful remakes in the past few years. But I have seen much worse films than "The Fog" in the genre praised highly on IMDb. This one is not bad at all. It is certainly worth a look if you are a fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Agreeable But Undistinguished Remake Of Classic Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On Antonio Island, a remote fishing community, the townsfolk are planning a celebration of their founding fathers when suddenly they are besieged by a mysterious fog. Nick Castle and his friend Elizabeth uncover an ancient diary which reveals the island's prosperity came from murder and pillage, and the ghosts of the dead have returned to seek their revenge ...The second remake in 2005 of one of John Carpenter's classic flicks, this one co-produced by the great man himself, is an enjoyable, spooky, entertaining ghost story, but not a patch on its predecessor. I would rate it higher if it weren't for the fact that it lacks the truly brilliant quality of the original - breathtaking, suspenseful atmosphere. It's okay though; it's a solid horror flick, but the direction is often formulaic and the cast (with the exception of Blair, who is excellent as Stevie the lighthouse deejay) are likable but undistinguished pros. It's also perhaps a little too faithful to the original, especially in the first hour, where there are numerous shots and screeds of dialogue lifted piecemeal. It makes some structural changes I don't like, turning an ensemble piece into the more traditional two romantic leads, but it comes up with some nice twists of its own for the conclusion, as the ghosts fulfil their fire-and-brimstone contract with the descendants of those who cheated them. Where it scores is in its depiction of the back-story (something the first movie couldn't afford) as we see the leper-ship looted and destroyed, and in its subtler moments - like the shots of the Victorian phantoms stalking the misty streets - it creates some genuine creepiness. There is also a good score by Graeme Revell and some nifty effects, like the moment when the fog chases Heppell up the beach to his house. An enjoyable horror movie for the undiscriminating, and worth catching, but make sure you don't miss the 1980 original. Shot in and around beautiful British Columbia and dedicated to co-producer Debra Hill, a gifted filmmaker and longtime associate of Carpenter's, who sadly died just prior to shooting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch The Original, It's much better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't go as far as to give this a 1, but it came close to deserving it. The first thing you have to ask when reviewing this film is have you seen the original. I have.There's going to be lots of spoilers so lets just dive right in.We have Selma Blair who looks about 13, and is no Adrienne Barbeu. She's playing Stevie Wayne and there isn't going to be any "Chased up the lighthouse" sequence in this version sadly. The boy playing her son looks older than she does, so clearly they picked the wrong person for that role. Someone who looks a fair bit older would have suited.We're back in Antonio Bay but this time we're calling it Antonio Island. Instead of smugglers/pirates/buccaneers (whatever they were in the original) we have a ship full of families with leprosy who have bought land on the island fair and square and their ship is set on fire and and they are robbed and killed by the founding fathers of Antonio Island.It seems most people on the island are related to at least one of the founding fathers (I would have liked to have seen the ghosts go up to the black guy, look at him, then ignore him as not related to the killers).The priest is played the same was as the original but the final conflict is in the Town Hall instead of The Church. The whole past lives things was a waste of time.Why Stevie didn't just take her brake off and put her car into neutral when she was on the road (she was on the crest of a hill facing downwards, she could have bump started the car that way easily) and how the truck missed her headlights which were on.The ghosts in the river and coming through the sink annoyed me. I noticed they kept the "saving Stevie's son through a window" idea.Mostly the plot has been kept the same apart from a few small places. If you want to enjoy the film and you haven't seen the original, by all means watch this.If you've seen the original and want to compare the two then watch this. Otherwise just stick with the original, this will leave a bad taste in your mouth and a lack of respect for John Carpenter who knows he could have done much better. He will have to produce something mind blowing and mentally scary to make up for this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worships the original, then defecates all over it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a remake is released, fans of the original can pick it apart for two reasons. Either it is too reminiscent of it's predecessor and therefore a pointless exercise (see Gus Van Sant's Psycho) or it isn't close enough to the original hence undeserving of it's title (see The Italian Job.) This remake of a low budget John Carpenter horror flick, the second to be released in 2005, manages to fail miserably on both counts. I warn you now, this deconstruction will contain spoilers.John Carpenter was a master filmmaker in his heyday. Halloween, The Fog, The Thing, Escape From New York, all cult classics. The Fog did less business than Halloween had done a year before and a lot of people missed it. A shame, because it's Carpenter at his schlocky best, laden with cheese and bad acting, but great fun. Carpenter's gift for creating wonder is evident in the first minutes as a craggy old sailor tells a group of wide-eyed sprogs a tale of the sea that occurred exactly 100 years ago to that day, in which we learn that the founding fathers of Antonio Bay murdered a ship full of sailors and stole their gold to build the town. We are then introduced to the principals. Nick Castle played by Tom Atkins (Lethal Weapon), Jamie Lee Curtis as hitchhiker Elizabeth Solley and Hal Holbrook camping it up as the impending-doom-fearing Father Malone. That's a tradition of that time in which all horror films needed a worried looking priest to hold it together. Chaos ensues, there are jumps and scares galore and if someone comes knocking at your door in the middle of watching this movie, you will jump six feet in the air, as the wronged sailors return through the fog to wreak vengeance on the towns people.Now, to 2005. Smallville star Tom Welling, Lost star Maggie Grace and Hellboy's Selma Blair all play roles taken straight from the original's screenplay. Hell, even some of the lines are direct from the 1980 flick. The first hour for the viewer who has seen the original, is deja vous as the movie plays out much in the same way. There are a few changes. The budget is bigger so the gloss shines through and some minor character changes are weaved in. Still, you're watching the same movie. In a 10 minute period, all mystery and fear (if you had any to begin with) evaporate as the story that our craggy old seaman told at the beginning of Carpenter's Fog is played out in flashback. Then, the ghosts start talking. Then the main honcho who could just as well be Cap'n Barbossa from Pirates of the Caribbean, kisses Maggie Grace's character and, well, it just doesn't bear talking about. Gone is the fear of the creeping fog bank. Gone are the faceless ghouls who will stop at nothing to get their revenge. Now you just wish they would have left it alone. Where the original had a dynamic ending, in this film the ghosts just leave. Honestly. It's like Michael Myers taking off his mask and sitting down to have a cup of hot tea with the kids.Normally I would judge a remake on it's own merits, but this doesn't have any and it's insistence on following the original so closely for most of the run time revokes it's "stand alone film" privileges. Despite some creepy images, the direction from Stigmata helmer Rupert Wainwright is downright tiresome. Some of the film's most intense scenes are intensity free due to his overuse of slow motion and the uneven but overall snail like pace. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are dull. Simply dull. They aren't like that on their respective TV shows. They have potential. It just goes to show that sometimes, actors need to do the high profile movie, good or bad, to get money and attention. In summation, see the grainy, low budget, badly acted original and enjoy, because this big budget update can't stand under the weight of it's unnecessary CGI and poor direction. If you see one Carpenter remake this year, see Assault on Precint 13.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was horrible!!!!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was hoping that it would be as great as the original. Boy, was I wrong! The ending was one of the dumbest I have ever seen and that is saying something!! The back-story was ridiculous and came out of nowhere. Things were just thrown out there for the audience and we are supposed to shut off our brains and go with it. I joined Blockbuster just so I didn't have to spend almost thirty dollars to buy it and I am glad I did. I'd rather lose five dollars than thirty. Maggie Grace was just irritating throughout the whole movie. It wasn't even believable that Tom Welling had any feelings what so ever for her and it looked like he was more into Selma Blair. This was such a letdown!!! I felt like a complete idiot after I watched it for wasting almost two hours of my life. Rent the original and burn your copy of this!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please STOP remaking classic movies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's bad enough that Hollywood has finally run out of original movie ideas, that they have resort to making either A) sequels to successful past movies that don't come close to the original, B) movies based on successful books/video games that don't come close to the original, or C) remakes of successful movies that don't come close to the original. This version of John Carpenter's subtle masterpiece "The Fog" falls into Category C. I was worried when I heard they were remaking this, and I wasn't disappointed (I should get a job predicting movie success/failures--no one believes me, but I'm right at LEAST 90% of the time). I was hoping it would stay true to the original, but so many liberties were taken to "make it so that modern audiences could relate to it" that it became a totally different film, and I don't mean that as a compliment. I mean, I can understand the modern music at the radio station and the up-to-date equipment. But why the gratuitous sex scene? Why the hoochy-koochy-dancers on the boat? And why make Elizabeth and Stevie related to the Founding Fathers (the FF's last names are never given in the original, except for Malone)? Also, there was never any logical REASON for the "attack"--at least in the first movie, it was the 100th anniversary of the crime that brought on the revenge (the crime took place in 1880; the movie was made in 1980). This crime took place in 1871, and the revenge took place in 2005?? 134 years?? That made less than no sense. And that ending?? Talk about anti-climactic. At least in the original, it ended the way it should have--it followed the plot line, it was the REASONABLE conclusion. This one--I only stayed with it to see how it played out, and it was completely unreasonable. I won't give it away, but it made NO sense to the plot. The special effects weren't even enough to redeem this sad excuse for a remake--I kept making jokes about "Pirates of the Caribbean" throughout the whole thing! I couldn't help it--I had to salvage this film somehow! That was the part that was so GOOD about the original, that you never really SAW the faces of the ghosts or graphic details of what they did--think "Blair Witch", people--less is MORE. The human imagination is the best scare tactic on the planet! Once you put a face on the fear, you can deal with it. It's the fear you CAN'T see that messes you up for days on end! All in all, another wasted rental from Blockbuster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie you can turn off at any point in time and not miss a thing. The only thing frightening about it was that they spent good money to make it. I found some of the "horror" scenes to be pretty corny - and I'm generally easy to scare. There are some scenes that aren't necessary for the story line and then it seems there are scenes missing to pull it all together.I'm giving it a 2 because the special effects were pretty good (the fog, the dead people). It seemed the actors were doing a pretty good job but there was no plot to pull it together. Too bad because it seemed like a good idea for a movie.I don't recommend this movie unless you have time and money to waste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Problems: Why was Stevie in the movie? what did she contribute to.. anything? How did she effect the plot? Was she not just a pretty face? Who the hell cares about Spooner? Why did Nick tell Liz to hide the tape and watch it? Was there a reason to suspect someone was framing him? Why not give an important piece of evidence to the police? Why did the screenwriter even insert the whole tape issue into the movie? Did it make a difference? Could it? Why did Spooner run away from the hospital? How did he contribute to the plot in doing so? He could've vanished all the same. Let's face it, only two things really had to happen in this film - Liz being captured by the ghosts (which makes no sense, but we'll get round to that), and seeing the full vision of why they are haunting the town. That's all, nothing else in the movie mattered. Why was Liz captured by the fog? The leper blonde was not "lost". All they did was to take a living blonde and convert her to something they already had, a blonde ghost. Why couldn't the fog kill Spooner? We know it's able to open doors and smash things. Why was it not able to push the handle and open the freezer? The vacuum argument is useless. How did Stevie manage to escape the ghost in the water? A body gets up and warns Liz, then collapses, and it leaves no mark on the characters.... So many questions, very few answers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film represents all that is garbage with new horror films.They took a great idea from John Carpenter and watered it down to WB Network/PG-13 proportions. Everything about this piece of trash is terrible. The new story, the new characters, the acting, the CGI, and the ending. Everything.All the wannabe scares were cliché PG-13 crap. I was waiting for the cat to jump out at some point. I couldn't stop from rolling my eyes and fighting the urge to shut it off. Instead of a ship of hook carrying pirates coming back for their gold, it is now a love story when the pirates are a colony of cane carrying victims who were burned alive and come back....why? Not quite sure. They show up, kill random people, and one girl turns out to be the ship captain's reincarnated girlfriend, and after a kiss she becomes a ghost. WHAT?!?! The film is 100% insulting. The token black guy hides in a freezer, and somehow still lives while becoming frozen solid with no oxygen. The priest gets killed with flying pieces of glass that completely go through his body without leaving one drop of blood. People get set on fire with CGI flames. The CGI ghosts look like the friendly spirits from Disney's Haunted Mansion ride. Old ladies turn into charcoal from arms popping out of garbage disposals. Cars sink to the bottom of the ocean with open doors and smashed out windows yet slowly fill up with water. Almost everyone who dies somehow goes flying through a window. The main characters can OUTRUN the ghosts. The stupidity is endless.Avoid this film at all costs. It's like the writers and director watched John Carpenter's cult classic, wrote down all the best scenes, and then replaced them with rewritten scenes by their own children.I'd give this a 0/10 if the scale went that low. Pure GARBAGE.</fullReview>

I also thought that it was to bad the special effects that we have today weren't available then, since it would have looked cooler.Well, we have the special effects now, the remade Fog does look cooler, but the movie still sucked. The first featurette in the special features section was decent though.Tom and Maggie were just watchable enough to not wretch. The story started quick enough at least, but it never held my attention. By the hour point I was bored by the movie and by the 75 minute mark I was fast asleep. I woke up as Maggie was walking towards... well, near the end. I wouldn't want to spoil the ending for anyone. I backed the DVD up to where I fell asleep and kept watching till the end of the movie.

		<fullReview>Antonio Bay is a quiet town isolated on an island. Nick Castle is a local fisherman trying to make the most of his somewhat fishing business. Stevie Wayne is the local radio DJ, who is interested in Nick.When Elizabeth Williams comes back from New York, Nick can't be happier. Though on Elizabeth's return, everything goes awry. A mysterious fog has come from sea, with inhabitants in it; murderous ghosts. The ghosts have come back to Antonio Bay for revenge on the descendants of the founding fathers of the town; Nick, Elizabeth and Stevie.In the realm of remakes, The Fog is one of the worst movie remakes. While the bases of all remakes just fall short of surpassing the original version, The Fog doesn't even come close. Even on its own merits The Fog would cause enuresis; which wouldn't surprise. Taking every cliché possible, its hard not to be bored within the first thirty minutes.While John Carpenter may have produced this film, it misses all the parts that made his film so good. When you look at John Carpenter's films, they aren't great pieces of cinema; dodgy dialog, hammy acting, but Carpenter always made them work and made them enjoyable. Carpenter has always place some sort of social commentary in his films, raising them beyond pointless entertainment. This version of The Fog missed every mark. The script is emaciated, like the script writers brain, with terrible dialog, perfectly match by awful acting. While credit could be given to Rupert Wainwright, trying to make a film based on atmosphere, but it fails miserably. The scares rely on loud sound effects, which is a poor mans way to evoke scares from a loud soundtrack.Tom Welling should stay of the big screen, sticking to the small screen for smallville. Maggie Grace performance is absolutely painful to watch. Selma Blair is the strongest link the acting, yet she gives one of her weakest performances.It could slip you into a coma, so The Fog is one to keep away from, if you like your brain not to be damaged.</fullReview>

If you want to see likable characters, again this is not for you. If you want to toss out some money and waste 90 minutes of your life, go for it. It is best to just stick to the 1980 original. This version did not build up any suspense or leave you rooting for anybody. A very flat movie, indeed, which had very little fog in it. The fact that this was filmed close to my home community does not add any stars to my rating.

		<shortDescription>May well be the worst movie I have ever seen...ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies that you know automatically are going to be bad, but you still see them anyways. Well, it works that way for me anyways, since I am just so anxious to bring my audience a review every now and then. The Fog was definitely one of those movies. Of course, the surprising part is where one turns out to have some good entertainment value or actually is better than what I was expecting. Would The Fog be one of these movies? Let's just say no. Hell no.Well, the basic plot of The Fog is that, a long time ago, the forefathers who built a community on some island robbed and killed a bunch of lepers who were given a deal to have half the island. A few hundred years later, the town is prospering. Nick Castle (Welling), a direct descendant of the forefathers, runs a fishing tour boat. He has been cheating on his long-distance girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Grace), another direct descendant, with Stevie Wayne (Blair), a radio DJ who happens to be another direct descendant, proving that everyone in this whole city, aside from the token black guy, are directly related to four people. How the gene pool filters out is still a little confusing, but let's just move on. Anyways, Elizabeth returns after her long absence, complete with weird nightmares about the leper burnings. Soon after, a mysterious fog rolls into town, complete with the sprits of the dead lepers who are looking to do some destroying.Yes, it is as dumb as it sounds. Not only does it also come complete with just about as many plot holes as they seem to have been able to think of, it also manages to hit just about every horror cliché known to man, including *inhales deeply* psychic visions, shower sex scene, reincarnation, stupid blonde girl who doesn't know when to stay put, token black guy, drunk priest, luckiest kid on the face of the planet, power losses and, last but not least, a really old book hidden behind a wall. That's keeping in mind I'm forgetting some. Oh, and did I mention telepathic dead lepers? From a horror perspective, the movie is even worse if that is possible. A lot of movies will have a death scene or two that just seems completely random and fake. Well, in this movie, every single death scene feels like that. We have not one, but two people spontaneously combusting, at least three being grabbed by absolutely nothing, a really dumb drowning incident and, my personal favourite, a woman who dies because she just turns to ash for no reason whatsoever other than she touched a weird hand. Then we also have a kid who just happens to outrun the fog. It all feels like they just wrote down whatever they thought of while drunk. Most offensively of all, it's not even scary.The acting is truly horror movie acting. Selma Blair may well be the only character in this movie who I didn't outright despise. Tom Welling is without a doubt the biggest ass of a protagonist I've seen recently. Maggie Grace proves that she really is only good for playing absolute snobs. It seems like they just picked two hot TV actors and threw them together. Then there is DeRay Davis as the token black guy, among the most annoying in my short-term memory. Kenneth Welsh is completely wasted as the mayor, who may well have no character whatsoever. This is less acting and more just standing there.I have to end this review now before I go insane. This is the first time I have ever actually yelled at my television out of anger and not fun. Anything that drives me to that length must be avoided at all costs. There are no scares or even any camp value in this wretched mess of a movie. This may well be the worst movie I have ever seen, factoring in movies like The Santa Clause 2 and The Ring 2. I don't care whether or not the original was good, this one goes into the pile or terrible remakes and just plain terrible movies. There is nothing good or even tolerable about this. If you don't see one movie this year, make it this one.Overall Rating ? 0%</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter, what have you done? !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this largely unwanted &amp; dull remake of the spooky &amp; entertaining original, the town of Antonio Bay is all the sudden visited by an eerie thick fog, inside the fog are a group of fishermen &amp; a band of lepers intent on destroying the towns people as payment of a ghastly deed that was done to them a century ago. I can't speak for everyone, but I for one am sick of the recent slew of horror movie remakes, weather they are good or bad, it's quiet obvious that Hollywood has run out of good idea's for horror films &amp; what's worse is that there are tons more on the way!. As for THE FOG, there was no need to remake it, it was a perfectly good horror film as it stood, with lots of suspense, eerie photography, JOHN CARPENTER'S excellent musical score &amp; some pretty scary villains, not to mention good acting &amp; directing. THE FOG (2005) has neither of these except one, I thought (&amp; I may receive a lot of criticism for this) that the camera work was better, RUPERT WAINWRIGHT's direction was well executed &amp; the knife in the eye ball scene which I thought was pretty decent, but besides that, this is a miserable excuse for a movie, I mean there is just not enough bad things one can say about this film, The CGI effects were pretty dominate here, the kills were mostly off screen &amp; bloodless, the youthful cast was "miscast" &amp; the ghosts never used their fishing hooks! you see now when the ghosts come after you they just have touch you &amp; you turn into a burnt black skeleton! the lead bad guy BLAKE actually shows his face in this one, looking like a refuge from PIRATES OF THE Caribbean &amp; is not scary in the least! There is something like fifty ghosts in this! in the original, things were scarier when it was just a small band of about 7 or 8 ghosts with a vendetta. The character of STEVIE WAYNE seemed out of place here &amp; unlike the original, she leaves the light house in order to drive away to save her annoying son only to meet head on with a transport truck &amp; land in the icy cold water, the transport driver does not stop to see if she's okay, he just continues to drive on as if nothing happened!. The lead female heroine of the show finds a diary hidden in behind the bricks of a boat house, that tells what happened a century ago &amp; at times she finds herself having weird flash backs about the crime (The explanation as to why is not only confusing, but laughable as well!). Carpenter's eerie score is also absent in this one, &amp; FATHER MALONE acts more like a town drunk &amp; feels out of place in the story. Regrettably the last film to be produced by the late DEBRA HILL. Most would vent their spleen on blaming Hollywood &amp; yes they are to blame for remaking this strictly for the greed factor, but a lot of this movies fault lies in the hands of Carpenter himself, who went along with this awful idea in the first place. No suspense, no scares, no fun! No wonder the studio never pre-screened this for critics &amp; fans, they were probably all ashamed at how bad this was! Shame on you Carpenter &amp; shame on you Hollywood. This film gives the middle finger to all horror fans! * star</fullReview>

For example, in stead of starting off the movie with a ghost story on the beach narrated by an actor with a good voice like John H., they resort to flashbacks. The character from the original are all but gone. Father Malone's character becomes a bit part and brings nothing to the story.This movie is painful to watch. It is not even worth the rental costs.

Nope, nothing, Nada. Unfortunately, this writers figured the only way to make the audience involved in the movie was to divulge the weak ghost story at the end.Apparently, the four founding fathers of this Oregon town actually stole the deeds to the land from the true title holders in 1870's. The 'founding fathers' eliminated all evidence of this treachery by killing all future inhabitants. Years and years later, the spirits came back to pay a little revenge on their kin thus bringing us present day (except I think there were a few people who weren't kin that were killed).Classic scary story that just didn't have enough scare (or acting skills) to make it into a GOOD movie.Question:I'm guessing the head honcho ghost was apparently married to Maggie Grace's 1870 character. He maybe 'returned' for her? If everyone died on that boat, who were Elizabeths (present day)ancestors? Confused about this pointless movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gentle glow of a morning mist flows across the sea and it makes you wonder, can there be something hidden in that cloud? That question can take a toll on your mind when it's around midnight and a giant fog bank is now flowing across the sea onto land. The Fog takes that idea, originally made by John Carpenter a while ago, and remade it into a joke rather then a scary question. The Fog packs one to many boring moments into a long movie that just treads on and on with no sense of horror or entertainment.Young Nick Castle and his girlfriend Elizabeth suspect their island of a hidden secret when finding a diary of one of the islands founders. The night before, a large fog bank rolled over Nick's boat and everyone except for his pal Spooner is killed off. Spooner gasps it was the Fog but no one believes him. The truth unravels as Nick discovers the island was founded by lepers, leaded by a rich man named Blake, who was ambushed and attacked on the sea's waves by the fake founders of the island. Now the town is being haunted by Blake and his team of ghost in the fog banks and it's up to Nick and Elizabeth to save the whole town. Yawn.This movie made me shed a tear. Not because I was so into the movies depth and genius, but because I was bored to death. I promise you there is not one moment in this whole film that will reach out and catch your mind and make you enjoy it. The movie is so slow and badly paced that it will make you leave the movie running as you go find something else to do. None of the actors make it worthwhile. Tom Welling plays a younger and gentler Nick Castle with so little enthusiasm, you feel as though he's going to look at the camera and ask "Where's my paycheck?" Maggie Grace plays Elizabeth who now has a purpose to be in the movie rather then Jamie Lee Curtises passing on through town character. She makes the role a slap dash dribble of damsel and secret holder. And we have Selma Blair playing the radio mistress Stevie Wayne who looks and sounds like she's sleepwalking through the part with such little acting that she's a complete mess. The special effects are alright, nothing special. The only problem is the special effects takes the mystery out of the ghost in the fog. Trying to give the fog a mind of it's own with computer generated ghost sucked. In the original, the ghost were scary because they were played by real people in solid form and you could not see their faces. In the remake, you can see the ghosts faces but can barely make out where they are standing because the frames are so cloudy and cobbled together with fire and smoke. The ghost were trashed apart in the movie, only being in it for a mere three minutes and having a newer purpose to kill. No they're not after a stick of gold, but love. And that my friends is a pure example of Changing the story and it will Suck.Director Rupert Wainwright came into this project and actually made it look like a cool movie to see but the film was a big disappointment. It crashes and blows up in the second act and can not pick up one ounce of steam to actually make it enjoying. This movie will move you. It will make you get up and Move over to the TV and turn this pile of trash off. The Fog gets a 1, a complete mess and one of the worst remakes ever. John Carpenter must be kicking himself for this producing choice, destroying one of his classic movies. John, let me give you some advise. Don't remake classics! The Fog= D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When good fog goes bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know that feeling when you're driving, or worse, walking, alone at night? All seems well, even cheerful in a moonlit sort of way, when you notice...ever so gradually...that the fog is rolling in? No matter how rationale we are by the light of day, there's something about the slow, inexorable way in which it silently slips up, blurring your vision and bringing a damp chill, that's undeniably eerie. For a moment, you can believe in ghosts.This movie is nothing like that.I liked John Carpenter's original Fog well enough, but when I heard they were planning on a remake, I thought they might do it right. Unlike some purists, I didn't think they were messing with a masterpiece. The original was a tight enough little ghost story, but the acting was sometimes pretty hard to swallow, and the effects and pacing both could have been brought up to date.Yikes.Unfortunately, they got just about everything wrong in this remake. It fails as a tribute to the original, losing all the slow, grim force of the fog itself in frenetically filmed "action" shots. The lighting reveals both too much (the ghosts are almost laughable CGI) and too little (many shots which should be well lit in order to contrast with the brooding presence of the fog are, instead, illuminated only by jittery flashlights.If they were aiming for a ghost story, they blew it badly. They telegraph too much with constant flashbacks to the events which set the vengeful ghosts in motion, then don't explain enough in an ending which is possible the worst, most abrupt and anticlimactic in recent cinema history.If they were aiming for an action-packed thriller, they blew it just as badly. The whole aura of fog, the reason it's spooky, is that it's slow and silent. Instead, these fog-ghosts run around at frantic speed, tossing people through windows and lighting folks on fire. It's silly, not scary.And gods, the holes in that plot! If these ghosts are supposed to be motivated by a thirst for revenge (and what good ghosts aren't) then their targeting stinks on ice. Random people come in for grief, while those who *should* be getting their comeuppance escape entirely.This is beyond missable - it's a sad waste of a lot of money which could have been better spent by firing 3/4 of the special effects losers and hiring a decent writer. I hope this one lost money at the box office.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The only good thing about this movie was that it prompted me to come here and check out the comment pages. I have not laughed this hard in a long time!! I agree with all the above. I'd like to demand the $3.79 I spent at Blockbuster for it. It was truly awful. I like Tom Welling in Smallville, but he made a big mistake taking this stinker on. I had figured that at least Selma Blair would make it interesting, but this Wainright guy, just blew it. Remind me to not watch any more of his films. Did anyone give a positive review on "the Fog"? Just out of morbid curiosity. Anyways, the price of admission might have been worth it, if just to read these reviews. "This movie might scare your 11 year old sister, if she's behind at school". HAHA! That kills me!!</fullReview>

It's not very original and i think there are way to much similarities to other movies. I hope some one enjoy's this movie cause i didn't like it that much. The special effects are okay i like especially the part where the kid runs from the fog. There were some nice shot's in it but i think with some actors who take it seriously it would been a promising movie cause these actors literally blow up this movie in a bad way.

		<shortDescription>Foggy concepts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes--love them or hate them. The remake of the Fog falls completely in the hate category. The original The Fog was a grade B low budget movie. The original was the kind of cheesy movie you find today in the direct-to-DVD bins. The story was that a ship full of lepers wanted to colonize an island in Oregan. The residents, of the island, cheat them out of their money and cause the deaths of the lepers. 100 years later the lepers spirits return and extract vengeance upon the ancestors of the settlers. This story had more holes than swiss cheese. What purpose would vengeance on the ancestors of their enemies serve? Their enemies still benefited from the murders and the ancestors really did do nothing wrong. The sins of the father should never be extracted upon the son. It was a bad story. The remake had all the same aspects with a slight twist at the end. The twist was about as interesting as the rest of the film though--none. The newer version not only stays with the original concepts, but the grade B acting (from the original) seems like Shakespeare compared to the newer version. The only decent part of the remake is the special effects; which are few and far between. This is a rental only--but even a $2.00 rental seems like a rip off after watching The Fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog 0.5 Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie industry has come up with some truly brilliant villains that shook our emotions and took over our nightmares. And then there's the rest of the pack, which are so laughable you'd wonder how they escaped from the circus and found their way in a horror movie.We all unfortunately remember the maniacal hotel room in "1408." Leave that room, and you still won't be safe, for the evil elevator in "The Shaft" will consume your soul. Leaping off a window won't help, 'cause M. Night Shyamalan's villainous air will catch up to you, and eventually, your unguarded lungs. Flee to Antonio Island, and there you will come face-to-fog with the fog in? "The Fog."This is an awful movie. By now, I would normally mention enough plot holes, technical errors, and logical fallacies to prove my point, but do I really need to? Trying to prove that "The Fog" is a terrible movie is like trying to prove that the sky is blue, that the grass is green, that global warming is? Anyway, it is a waste of time, and in this case, a waste of words in a review. But I've already started, so I'll give it a shot.Read more here: http://localmoviereview.com/fog-2005/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are the fashion nowadays, and The Fog was a good candidate. Not because the original is bad, but because it was so good that it's strong story could likely stand the test of updating. Unfortunately, the remake turned out not to be much of a test.To make this short, the only good things in this movie are Selma Blair and some sweeping shots across the island and surrounding water. Tom Welling is ineffectual in the lead role, and - on this evidence - Maggie Grace simply cannot act. She comes across as a Paris Hilton type - someone famous for being something else, who tries their hand at acting and fails miserably. The ineptness of her performance is such that it really detracts and takes the viewer out of the movie.Some things get changed around from the original, not for any great benefit. With the journal in Grace's hands, we get the backstory piecemeal and in a more confusing way than in the original movie. For a horror movie, there is virtually nothing to get scared by. The ghosts are about as scary as the ones from Pirates of the Caribbean.In all, this film is actually a testament to the skill of the makers of the original movie, which is superior in every respect. Twenty years later, with far more technology at their disposal, the result is an abject failure on every level.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, I admit. I was alone, sick and bored and "The Fog" was the only thing worth watching on TV. Yes, it's sad, I know. The first half hour isn't too bad, it actually builds up suspense and I admit that I had a few jumps (I was alone in the dark, remember!) BUT after about 45 minutes my interest waned. It's not just the bad acting, Maggie Grace from TV's "Lost" has zero talent and Tom Welling aka Superman is also devoid of emotion, together they lack chemistry. The inane script adds to the tedium and the plot holes, well, the mind boggles! The fog has the sillest script ever consisting of pure drivel that the writer expects you to believe! I won't give anything away because I don't see why I should be the only one to suffer this agonising movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oooh! Shiny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film that's not concerned with characters, not concerned with story, not concerned with atmosphere, and I'd even go so far as to say it's not concerned with even formula. It's focus is one thing, and one thing alone: spectacle. After all, this isn't the small independently financed ghost story from 1980 ? oh no, it can afford explosions, flashy CG effects, and bodies flying through windows every chance it gets. It wants to show you the flashy screen distractions it purchased with its larger budget.Yes, this is the Mission Impossible of cinematic horror remakes. But apparently the new Fog could not afford the "horror" as in "horror movie" as in "why am I watching this counterintuitive genre film?" Early in the film, the fog first appears out of nowhere overtaking a small fishing ship where two guys and two girls would be doing something naughty except for the tiny detail that they live in a PG13 film. So, instead, the girls are dancing and the black guy has a video camera. Right. Not that I have anything against PG13 horror (the 3 good ones), but when every inch of the celluloid is screaming for an R rating, don't water it down.Moving on: after the fog mysteriously materializes out of nowhere, making all the boat's equipment go haywire, the party's over. The girls are inside the ship's bridge, the guys are out on deck where an old sailing vessel came out of the fog and vanished. The fog gets the girls first and, are you ready for this, throws their bodies through a window. Ghosts in the fog go through the trouble of throwing bodies through windows.It's a thing called subtlety. This film does not have it.Wait, I'm not through ? it's not enough for a man to burn to death. Oh no, his smoldering skeleton has to fly through a door, across an entire room, and crash into equipment. And the film's climax? Lots of shattered glass. Flying CG glass. An old man thrown through yet another window, magically pushed across a street, and into a cemetery. Not to mention more fire.Did it occur to anyone on this film that "hey, maybe we should pull back a tad before this reaches ridiculous levels?" Or, I dunno, "Maybe our effects shouldn't be exponentially more developed than every other aspect of this film." Yes, the effects are the Fog's strong point. I'll skip the story criticism out of pity, and simply say that the Fog brings nothing new to the overused flashback device. It's not bad, just mediocre. And sadly, juxtapose to the two leading performances in the film, I wanted to stick with the flashbacks and forget about the characters in the current time line. The acting, wow, to quote Colonel Kurtz, "the horror, the horror." Tom Welling and Maggie Grace, our leads, demonstrate their knowledge about acting, and curiously made me question whether or not they actually know how to act (I'll reserve my judgment for now.) They know to look left, to look up, to look sad, to look happy, to make eye contact, and yet they never emote. Through the entire film the audience never sees the characters Nick Castle and Elizabeth Williams. We see Tom Welling and Maggie Grace making semi-appropriate faces and gestures to match the mood and scenarios they find themselves in. And I use the phrase "semi-appropriate" deliberately because throughout the performances both actors are clearly suppressing smiles even in their most horror strickened, soul tearing, depressing moments. You know, like the type of acting you'd expect from TV commercial actors? Like Jason Ritter from Freddy Vs Jason.Maybe they didn't care. Maybe they didn't try. Considering the roles handed to them (and everyone else on the film) I can't say I'd blame them were that the case. Nick is supposed to be something of a renegade stoic youth, his own man with his own business, unbound by the history books or silly traditions. Elizabeth is supposed to be the girlfriend looking for the answer to her nightmares, looking for her place in the world. Spooner is the goofy token black guy. Stop me when this sounds familiar.Truthfully, I found myself longing for the film to explore the role of the torn alcoholic Father Malone (one of the background character) than spend any more time with Nick and Elizabeth. Or perhaps even his dad, city official Tom Malone. Unlike the two lead characters, these men showcase a few hints at psychological depth ? even if those hints were nothing more than an overused writing device. At the very least the actors playing them display a conviction in their parts.Perhaps the most intriguing character in the film, also the most underused, comes in the form of Stevie Wayne played by Selma Blair. Who, interestingly, plays the character of a jaded disc jockey. Yes, an actress playing an unenthused woman is the highlight, the inspiration, and arguably the most vibrant performance in the entire movie simply because there within lies an actual character.Because when Selma Blair looks up from behind her mic and sighs, the audience actually gets the sensation that that's what the character, Stevie Wayne, would do. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace, they look up at a cued time because that's what the director has told them to do. They are actors acting, but Stevie Wayne is real.One of the few genuine characters in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Scooby-Doo gang could have solved this mystery quicker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>2005's remake of the classic film "The Fog" had everything going for it: An eerie title with prior association, the late Debra Hill as a producer, and a hot cast including Tom Welling, Maggie Grace and Selma Blair. Unfortunately, "The Fog" didn't live up to the hype, and was over-all, rather boring, and definitely not scary.In typical horror-fashion though, something that happened in the past finally comes full circle to destroy a sleepy island town, and when it comes down to it, it is quite likely that the viewer will be wanting this mysterious fog to destroy the town, simply because there are absolutely no characters that you can care about. Hottie Tom Welling is rather stable as his character Nick Castle, while Maggie Grace is somewhat devoid of emotion as his returning girlfriend Elizabeth Williams. Unortunatly for the both of them, who are fine actors, their characters are so boring and underdeveloped that if they weren't nice to look at, you'd probably want to watch the trees in the background. So little is revealed about them that they can hardly be called leading characters.The same goes for Selma Blair, who plays radio host Stevie Wayne, and while she is quite lively, this is a far cry from Blair's terrific performances in "Cruel Intentions" and "Kill Me Later". DeRay Davis is terribly annoying as Nick's friend Spooner, Rade Serbedgia is unrecognisable as Captain Blake, while true to horror form, the figures of authority are bumbling idiots. Even Elizabeth's cold mother Kathy, though Sara Botsford does really well in the small amount of screen time she is given. The only character that you really hope survives is of course Stevie's son, Andy, played by Cole Heppell, who gives a fine performance and shows some promise for a serious career in acting.Other than boring characters, the plot of the film is rather convoluted, and while that's nothing new in horror, this "Fog" doesn't really turn out to be horror, and while the flashback scenes are quite interesting, taking place at various points in the film (including one particularly sad and disturbing scene towards the end) they are quite distracting from the present-time story. In saying that though, the film does have some positive features - the special effects are decent, and the cinematography crisp and effective. That alone however does not make the film a "must-see", especially as the gang from Scooby-Doo could have solved the mystery far quicker these wannabes. It's a terrible shame that one of the lovely Debra Hill's last films is so disappointing. R.I.P. Debra Hill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Say It's Not Scary? Well, Neither Were Any of the Friday the 13ths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is a remake of the old John Carpenter pic from 1980 which gained a following on VHS after it's own lackluster theatrical debut. It tells the story of a cursed town which falls under a supernatural siege on the centennial anniversary of a tragic crime which saw a number of settlers robbed and murdered. The special effects are the saving grace here. The cg fog is a graceful, threatening entity that envelopes the screen and generates some nice suspense. The problem is that it's not scary in and of itself. The cast is feather weight and the characters are paper thin. As slickly produced as The Fog is, it's not very involving or satisfying. It's quite watchable but that's about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. I didn't really think this movie could be as bad as the ratings made it out to be. But it really is a very, very poor movie. So poor, in fact, that I wrote this review whilst watching it! This movie is just full of all kinds of stupid. The usual horror tropes of characters doing dumb things doesn't even come close to describing what goes on here.Add in scene after scene of terribly contrived events and the whole thing rapidly becomes farcical. I really don't know where to begin. The whole movie is one giant FAIL! It's not remotely frightening. In fact, I laughed hysterically at a number of scenes that were meant to be scary and spent the rest of the time in a bemused sense of disbelief In fact, that's what this movie should have been called. Scary Movie: The enFoggening. It plays out like some terrible parody. It is difficult to watch it and not think it was intended as such.On a practical level it also has problems. The Fog of the title is, at times (too many times!) very obviously CGI. Bad CGI! Leprosy is portrayed as some horrible flesh eating disease more akin to MRSA than what it actually is.The script isn't, I suspect, all that bad and neither is the basic premise of the story. It's just the realization of it that is so poor. Scenes are foreshadowed literally only moments before they happen. An example is when the driver of a pickup comments that the fog is too thick and he can't see anything. Cut to scene of pickup speeding along. Then - oh noes! - there is a crash! It's just awful. You'll be guessing every scene well before it happens. It's like they went through "Horror Writer's Bible of Clichés" and ticked off each one and wrote a little scene for it.If you're drunk, I think this movie would be a real treat with your mates. As a serious horror movie, however, it sucks, with all the fright power of the Teletubbies movie.As a side note, I watched it in HD and let's say you might want to avoid that, if possible. Some of the sets and make-up effects look really obvious under the glaring light of such high definition imagery.In summary (thank God its over!) only to be recommended for the desperate or the drunk. Treat it like a parody and you'll get much, much more enjoyment out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake with such promise, unfulfilled.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Generally one remakes a film because they feel there is something missing, something that can be improved on or done better. Sometimes they are updated to make them more relevant to 'today's audience' which is usually code for 'younger/more familiar actors', 'needs more gore' or someone has a career they are trying to promote, depending on the whim of the director. This film has all three, including introducing a needless love story angle which just fizzles based on the way the characters are presented. Instead of a creepy soundtrack, I'm expected to be terrorized by a bunch of pop songs? Hardly menacing in any way and worse, serving to immediately date the film.The movie is shot well-its not hard to look at and the people you are supposed to sympathize with are all very pretty/sexy. I was thinking with a little money and some newer actors and the available technology/effects they would at least do something daring with the film. Instead it was one endless nu horror cliché after another with CW/television level acting. In addition, the characters were just so unsympathetic. The main character is cheating on the girlfriend with the DJ which is explained away because the girlfriend just "Up and left town for 6 months" without saying where she was. Huh? So essentially, she is missing for half a year? When he happens to pick her up on the main road into town, ala Jamie Lee Curtis' character in the original, they just go on like "hey no big deal, glad you're home! lets have sex!" Her mom acts like some cold cardboard Ice Storm extra, the priest is either totally drunk or totally sober depending on what scene and "Stevie Wayne" the heroine of the original is acted by Blair like some house cat who dialed in what is probably one of the worst performances in the film though not the only one.While the effects in the original film are simply done and creepy due to looking 'natural' (i.e. its really 'fog' they created in much of the first film) almost every sequence where the CGI is used feels forced-I'm thinking particularly of the scene with the aunt burning up but the fog itself is too digitized to be creepy). Really the only sequence that was interesting to watch were with the Elizabeth Dane, where the make up seemed good, the effects natural looking and the acting believable. Sadly, I cannot say the same for the rest of the film.The only person I felt sorry for was the old man with his dogs but his story arc seems unexplainable and meaningless, other than showing cruelty towards him and his dogs. In the original film, this doesn't even matter. Dogs are shown barking, not being left as a steaming corpse on a dock or worse yelping in pain in the darkness. What would the dead even care about the dogs anyway since the plots revenge angle is about the people? You can tell a lot of this was created to please a very specific demographic (I'm thinking people who watch Buffy or those who feel the Final Destination films are rife with pathos) but if you wanted to see a reasonably scary horror film, this isn't the one.This film has so many plot holes that, rather than the viewer being able to ignore them, the film collapses into them. I am not sure why Carpenter was even involved other than writing and directing the original. This isn't the worst film I have ever seen, but I really felt like it didn't do the main thing a horror film should do which was to scare me or at least keep me entertained and it did neither.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen the eighties version of this film many times growing up and can honestly say I love it. Even for a retro movie the eighties version is still great. My favourite movies are the Halloween movies and as soon as I saw that this was a remake of the original by the makers of halloween I couldn't wait to see it. Unfortunately it's a very, very poor imitation of the original film proving that newer isn't always better.Looking past the many immediate issues with the film I.e. the dating and setting of the movie. the acting seems out of place and awkward.Now we obviously know film makers skirt past the obvious to make us scream at the screen and beg the actors to do what we think they should be doing, this is why young girls always run up the stairs in horror movies when they should be running out the door. This film however goes beyond this and causes blatant outrage.Given the fact that I really didn't enjoy this film it's still one I've added to my collection for prosperity. I'd advise everyone out there to watch this film and then watch the eighties version to see how a real thriller is made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although in all honesty the story doesn't make much sense if you think about it (and you really don't have to think that hard to realize that it doesn't make much sense) this somehow manages to lead into a decent enough last twenty minutes or so. The only problem is that this is more than an hour and a half long. Mercifully, I found myself repeatedly waking suddenly after dropping off to sleep for that period. That's the impact the movie had on me; that's pretty much the level of suspense it kept me in throughout. Yes, the ending isn't bad, but it's questionable whether the average person is going to make it there. It's a bad story that makes little sense, and generally weak performances throughout. I'll give it a bit of credit for somehow managing to put all that "badness" aside and come up with a relatively decent (even if it does make as little sense as the rest of the movie) finish.

I Thought there were many chilling scenes in this version especially in the last twenty minutes after the build up to the final visit from the 'Settlers'.I can not imagine where all these bad comments are coming from except that maybe todays jaded horror film audiences expect a lot of senseless gore, cursing and nudity in a film to be considered "good". This film managed to deliver the chills with out using those cheap modern day crutches and a minimum of violence. I've been a horror film fan for over 35 years and I've seen or tried to see most of the so called "good" horror films. For instance the other night I saw the Italian made 'Demons' http://imdb.com/title/tt0089013. Many viewers call that a great horror film giving it over six stars at the IMDb. I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of it cause it was so poorly done. What it called "horror" was simple gross scenes of blood and gore one after another. 'The Fog' is way better than junk like that.No matter what people here are saying, both my wife and I enjoyed this film and recommend it to other true horror film fans. It's a throw back to the days when a horror film used atmosphere instead of gore to deliver the chills. And, Yes, the effects are good. Give this film a chance if you are mature enough, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Low Tide"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure many have been happy with the new "resurgence" of horror films in the past couple of years. I'll admit, I do like a good scary movie. But I have noticed that here lately, a lot of horror films have just flat out sucked. And, it seems that the horror remakes have really, and I do mean REALLY, sucked big time. Dawn of the Dead is one of the exceptions, and I was hoping that The Fog (remake of the 1980 John Carpenter cult classic) would join Dawn as a good remake. About the only thing good about this new Fog film is the ultra-hot Selma Blair playing Stevie Wayne. Hearing Selma talk like a phone sex girl turned me on, but it wasn't enough to help this weak remake. How many women can say the words "low tide" and make it sound so damn sexy? Not many can, but Selma did it. Still, it wasn't enough. She could not save this train wreck of a film. Hell, not even Superman (Smallville's Tom Welling) could save this movie. Well, I think Welling just wanted to make some extra dough and signed on. Plus, I'm sure he wanted to get next to Selma after hearing her say "low tide". I know I would have signed on for that reason...lol.Anyways, this movie takes you back to when horror films were just plain dumb. If you can remember the eighties, then you remember all the dumb horror flicks that came out. Nowadays, studios want to make horror films PG-13, so they can make a buck. Well, when you do that, you get weak crap like The Fog, Boogeyman, Ring Two (alothough Ring One was very good), and When a Stranger Calls. Now, you can make a good PG-13 horror movie, as long as there is a solid script. The Fog does not have that, nor is it all that scary. There are a few moments that can get you to jump, but a horror film is supposed to scare you. The Fog doesn't do it at all.So. What's the movie all about? Well, I will say this without giving out spoilers. The movie tries to tell us why this actual "fog" is happening, and why it is killing people. Basically, the "fog" is ticked off at Antonio Bay, and it wants revenge. Seem silly? Well, it is, but for me to tell you more would ruin it for those who have not seen it. To be honest, the people in Antonia Bay (present day) are taking the blame for what the towns ancestors did years earlier. That is all I will say about the story. Trust me, once it all develops, you'll still be scratching your head wondering why in God's name this script got approval. It is a basic script, and an easy one to follow. Yet, it has many, many holes in it that are never explained.In any case, watch it to hear Selma Blair's sexy voice. Trust me. Her "low tide" comment will get you turned on. If you are a guy, suggest this movie (over porn), cause Selma can get ya going. Otherwise, try not to figure this movie out. It is obvious that anybody involved with the making of this film never could figure it out either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a John Carpenter fan. Although I am not a fan of the recent Assault on Precinct 13 I am not one of those people who automatically hate all remakes. I thought Dawn of the dead and Texas Chainsaw Massacre both were solid films with Amityville Horror and The Grudge on a lower rung. I really enjoyed the directors "Stigmata" so I was actually quite interested in this film. Sadly that enthusiasm faded pretty quickly once the film began.First off the kiddie cast list got me very nervous. It make no sense to me that someone can make the leap of logic from Tom Atkins to Tom Welling. I understand that horror movies are aimed at younger people, they always have been, but are young people incapable of watching anyone on screen who is not in their peer group? I am not even going to mention the quality of his performance or the lack of chemistry with co-star Maggie Grace. It was simply a unnecessary distraction in a film that really should have been trying to keep the audience hooked on the ambiance and not thinking about the many faults.When the film began and we were treated to the next major change. The originals odd jazz station which gave the film a trippy vibe was replaced by generic, music of the moment, that seemed to be nothing but a commercial for a soundtrack album. As much as I like Selma Blair I have to admit that I really missed Adrienne Barbeau although in Selma's defense I think she played the role as well as anyone could have.The biggest problem with this film is that all changes were done in the hopes of broadening the audience and none were done simply to improve the story. It is hard to argue any logical reason for changing the drunk fishermen in the original to two babes in bikinis. It was done because it was assumed that it was what the audience would want to see. That shows both a disrespect to the material and to the potential audience. People are not as stupid as this film likes to assume and they can spot pandering quite easily.I have gotten this far without even mentioning the ending which leaves several major questions unanswered. If the ghosts were after revenge why did they leave Nick Castle alive, if they were after the girl why did they kill so many people. It was sloppy story telling which seemed par for the course for this truly weak offering.Seek out the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feeling penitent? Say three Hail Mary's and watch The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah, Maggie Grace in her skivvies. Her scantily-clad body may inspire sinful thoughts, but watching the rest of this movie is penance enough to cover them, with plenty of absolution to boot. So pause, rewind, and enjoy, because the balance of this movie blows.It begins with some guy getting predictably killed by a monster/ghost/whatever, and then moves on to introduce Nick Castle, the hunky male lead, and the stereotypical funny black sidekick, Spooner. They trade some lame quips while Nick takes off his shirt and displays his hunkiness. We learn he's been getting it on with another woman while his girlfriend is out of town. The "other woman" is the radio DJ Stevie, played by the delectable Selma Blair. And believe it or not, *none* of this ends up having any bearing on the plot.Later, Nick tries to pick up a woman on the side of the road, and realizes it's his girlfriend Elizabeth, who is suddenly back in town, unannounced. We never learn why she left, or where her luggage is, but what matters most is that she is played by Maggie Grace and later she will appear in her underwear. She playfully teases Nick about picking up other women because, unlike women of the real world, she realizes that a guy who sleeps around while his girlfriend's out of town is really a lovable rogue, and not a cheating prick at all.Nick takes Elizabeth to her Mom's house where we learn they don't get along, who knows why. Mom also points out Elizabeth's lack of luggage, but that also remains unexplained. Elizabeth tells Nick as they leave that going there in the first place was pointless. We find ourselves vigorously nodding our heads in agreement.Next, Nick and Elizabeth have sex in Nick's shower. I hate scenes like this. Hunky male leads in stupid movies always have huge, expensive showers, even if they have no money and live in a tree. Nick drives a beat-up old pickup truck, but he has a shower big enough to park it in. Go figure.Spooner, meanwhile, is partying with a friend and two girls on the boat, when the fog sweeps up and they die in unsurprising, unfrightening ways. What a waste. To think they could've all partied with Nick in the shower.Finally, we get to see Elizabeth in her underwear, and the best part of the movie is over. That doesn't stop the wretched film from plodding on: turns out Spooner is the sole survivor of the boat incident, and now now he's a triple-murder suspect. Nick finds a videotape on the boat and hides it from the police because it proves Spooner's innocent. Huh? He gives the tape to Elizabeth, who loses it in the ocean, but the police let Spooner go *anyway*, presumably based on his testimony that "the fog killed them."This would all make sense if the fog were actually a huge cloud of marijuana smoke and everyone in the movie was completely stoned. In fact, it would make it a much better movie. As it is, well, Maggie's underwear scene is entirely too short. Pause, rewind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is a movie with great potential for thrills and spills but alas it leaves you sorely disappointed. A combination of bad script, poor editing, wooden acting and an inconsistent plot all serve to make this a really pointless exercise.The editing was just so awful; the film lacked flow, moving from scene to scene with no link, chopping up the storyline to the extent it leaves you scratching your head, wondering if anyone actually watched the movie to check it before releasing it.The script is also pretty bad - lots of "Wait there", "Come on" and "Hurry up"s to pad it out a bit but you also can't get away from the wooden acting. There seemed to be too many minor characters and not enough focus on the lead actors, which might explain their lack-lustre performance - except for Selma Blair, who would have stolen the show if it were worth stealing.There are also some great special effects towards the end of the movie if you can wait that long, but you might just wish the fog would come and get you first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be rather awful. The whole thing seems to be made of cheep scares. The plot made almost no sense, and it took almost the whole movie to even figure it out. When the ending arrived (thank god) it made so little sense in itself, I'm still trying to figure out what happened. The movie was really just a big set with a fog machine and a truck load of corpses (dolls). it seemed as though they attempted to scare the audience by showing every marred corpse at least twice, and unnecessarily killed of characters to 'add' to the effect. The acting was terrible, the ending sucked, and you can name more then a dozen impossibilities. (not counting the whole ghost story) even the leapers were designed wrong. The movie sucked over all and I don't recommend wasting any time or money to see it.</fullReview>

I rented the unrated version, and I have to say, I've seen worse stuff on in Disney films. The movie was barely PG-13 as is. Every time there was an attempt at tension, the director shifted gears, and, as a result, left so many unanswered questions it was baffling. The script was terrible, the direction was clueless, the effects were awful, and the ending was one of the worst I've ever seen in a horror film. This is a simple story (seemingly hard to mess up) and a remake that had serious potential. Instead, the film was aimed at a younger audience, severely dumbed down, exhausted almost every possible horror movie cliché... I... I feel ashamed for the director... and I want that hour and a half of my life back...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie the day it was released thinking it would be a good movie. The movie was rated Pg-13 and since I was babysitting a 10 year old cousin who loves horror movies, I thought I could burn some time by watching a flick. The movie was confusing, and in a lot of ways dull. I hated the token black guy, why couldn't the fog get into the freezer? doesn't fog usually come in cold weather? Another thing is why did the fog kill innocent people? like the two girls on the boat? I left the movie with a billion questions about what was going on. The most confusing part, was when the movie went back into the past to see the Elizabeth Dane boat, and then it was in the present? which left me wondering if the people on the Elizabeth Dane were originally ghost? another concern is the ending, the main female character is actually a reincarnated wife? that part must've been added in to add more time to the movie. Overall it was confusing. Don't expect a scare from this. My 10 year cousin laughed almost every five second.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh my god. Seriously, those 3 words are the basic round up of a god- awful movie and cast. Nothing about this embarrassing effort is remotely scary, and the story line seems to have a mind of it's own. Seriously, killer fog? You really expect audiences to be genuinely scared from your $49 smoke machines? Geez, were you wrong! Actually, I was pretty excited about this movie. I went to see it in Orlando FL and anticipated a good scare. It was the build up before I found the courage to go see Saw 2, and what a disappointment! However, if you are interested in a total comical farce of a movie, this is it! The whole theatre was in stitches, I mean people were clapping as they left, but i suppose it was claps of Yes! it's over, rather than, "What a life changing movie!" Honestly, What happened to Selma Blair? She was so promising in Cruel Intentions... career in downhill nose dive I think.However, the soundtrack saved the movie, Fall Out Boy was the highlight of that one night that I will bitterly never regain. Those 2 hours could have been spent so much better, if only i'd known.........</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people might consider me a complete moron now, but I find this a pretty entertaining horror film. The fog isn't a movie where you have to think and stay focused the whole time, like the ring. It's more a no-brainer, you rent for a day, like the later Friday the 13th movies. This kind of movies don't need to be scary, you just need to enjoy the killing. The special effects are nicely done. The computer generated fog looks pretty neat, but in some scenes you can see they just used plain smoke. The acting wasn't great, but not the worst acting in a horror movie.I don't think this movie is a complete disaster, I rated it a 6, because it was entertaining, but not scary and that are most horror films these days. You just need to learn to like these new kind of horror movies and not expect it to be scary, but entertaining. I also didn't see the original, so I didn't compare it or something.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***may contain spoilers***being a fan of horror films, i was so looking forward to seeing the remake of the 1980 "the fog", which i considered to be one really good scary movie. i became quite dubious of its quality when a host of virtually unknown actors were slated to play the leads but nonetheless, gave it a shot (who knows, it may turn out to be a good after all).i didn't see the movie on screen, but on a DVD i borrowed from a friend - and i'm so glad i didn't waste my money on it. the movie was a total waste. i don't think it's because i kept comparing the lines, the characters, the personalities of the characters and the story / plot with the original. the film really just sucked.in the remake, they were not able to successfully depict or show the jubilation and excitement of the townsfolk as they prepared to celebrate their centennial (there was a celebration, an unveiling of some sort but for what?); stevie's feeling of total hopelessness when she saw the fog bank approach the city and her panic as she asked listeners to save her son; the fear the survivors must have felt when they were hiding from the fog (the original showed them hiding in a church which is probably what you'd do if you're faced with ghosts .. who would hide in the city museum?), the torment father malone felt when he realized why the ghosts have returned.in the first film, they explained that capt drake wanted revenge and number of lives he took was equal to the number of conspiring forefathers. in this film, he just killed ... end of story.**spoiler alert** and if his main intention was really to find his long-lost love (why she didn't become a ghost but became reincarnated as a descendant of one of the forefathers is beyond me), the film was not able to develop and build on this plot/premise early on. it could have worked, but it was just ... lacking.generally, the film was a total drag and was (as the title goes) a major disappointment. if you want to watch a horror movie on a lazy Saturday night and only the remake of the fog is available, you might as well just sleep.(i think that goes for most remakes, the amityville and the shining were not as scary as the original ones)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So here was me thinking like an idiot the remake of the fog, wow its going to be excellent. Thirty Minutes into the film I realised just how wrong I was. This film is a waste of time, the original film at least had a lot of suspense and tension. This one had about as much tension as us deciding whether to order pizza or Chinese for a takeaway. I had switched it off halfway through but thanks to Cedric the Entertainer we came back to watch the rest of it. Yes thats right the only film worse then this has got to be Johnson Family Vacation and we though we'd go back to the lesser evil thatis The Fog. As a result I think its only fair that the the makers of The Fog write a letter of thanks to Cedric for driving the audience back to the Fog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So I've just sat through The Fog 2005 (unrated version), starring Tom Welling, Maggie Grace &amp; Selma Blair. For those that don't know, Welling is the young Clark Kent in Smallville, Grace is the useless blonde bint from Lost &amp; Selma Blair really should need no introduction!About the only good thing I can say about this film is that the Fog effects were pretty cool.The plot this time is not that the town lured the Elizabeth Dane to the rocks, but that four townsfolk met the ship, robbed them, then set fire to it. Now the lepers have returned within a ghostly Fog, to wreak vengeance on the descendants of these four men.And there is problem number one. 4 men - Castle, Malone, Wayne &amp; Williams did the wicked deed. That means they could be coming for Nick Castle, Stevie Wayne, Mayor OR Father Malone and Elizabeth OR her mum, Kathy Williams. So how come they don't take them all??None of the characters in this are sympathetic in any way. Welling plays a rather dull, unheroic and frankly unlikeable Nick Castle (maybe he wanted to be the opposite of his Smallville character), Selma Blair gets practically nothing to do - there's no classy, sassy, sexy chic here like the original Stevie Wayne. And Maggie grace? Is there any acting this gal can do other than annoying? She is so unbelievably untalented that I'm surprised she made it into a show as highly regarded as Lost.We also have the addition of (and I'm not the racist one here, the film makers are) the token black guy as comic relief. DeRay Davis is playing apparently the only black person in Antonio Bay, who is there merely to hit out with smart-ass comments and hit on drunk chicks. Also, he manages to survive the Fog, out at sea, when the other occupants all die, by hiding in a freezer. FOR A WHOLE NIGHT.Want my advice? Go buy the original &amp; maybe even send Rupert Wainwright a copy, cause the guy knows nothing about making a decent horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, first I would like to say, this movie was the worst thing I have ever seen in my entire life. I have seen the original, and it scared me. I had issues with falling asleep after watching that movie. And I was very afraid of fog for awhile. So I went to see this one, hoping maybe that they would have added a few special effects, just to make it look slightly more realistic. Even if they had made it take place in a more modern setting (but stuck to everything else) I probably wouldn't have minded. BUT NO. Instead, I see this movie that had HORRIBLE acting, a SUCKY plot, and STUPID DIGITAL EFFECTS. I thought the point of using computers for CG effects was to make things look BETTER, not WORSE. I wished the entire time this movie was playing, that something would happen to the film and we could all go home. It lasted forever. And nothing remotely scary happened. I get scared at movies all the time, and this was completely worthless. I made a friend watch the original, and she was screaming before anything with Blake and his crew took place. The little "twist" at the end with Elizabeth joining the ghosts was interesting, but VERY PREDICTABLE. Plus, it wasn't even a part of the original. All I have to say is, Hollywood, PLEASE stop trying to modernize re-makes and stick with the original scripts...PLEASE. We want good horror films, not stupid chick flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll qualify my review by admitting my prejudice...the original "The Fog" is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. So, this one had a lot to live up to. Still, I had an open mind. But not only does it not live up to the original, it just flat out isn't good at all. The story and script here is pure crap. And somehow, they managed to take all the classic scares from the first film and find a way to ruin them. Then the film culminates in a nonsensical ending.On a purely shallow note, Tom Welling might be one of the most insanely beautiful actors working today, and he's not bad in the film. He shows some presence. On the other hand, Maggie Grace is a good looking girl with all the charisma and expression of a block of wood. There's more spark and chemistry in a 2 minute scene between Welling and Selma Blair then there is in any scene Grace shares with him (including a supposedly steamy shower scene).Wishing for better things ahead for Blair and Welling, and chalk this one up to a learning experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went and saw this movie in theaters with two of my friends as something to do on a Saturday. I saw the previews and wasn't impressed, but I decided to go anyway, because it was either The Fog, or Chicken Little. Now that I have seen it, I REALLY wish we went to Chicken Little. I went into the movie unenthusiastic, and came out laughing hysterically and feeling cheated. Everything in it was cliché and had lame coincidences. For instance, when Elizabeth falls in the little pool of water in the old boat house, she swims to the side and tries to climb out, the rocks she grabs onto somehow come loose and expose a perfectly shaped hole containing a book telling all the secrets to tie the plot together. WHAT ARE THE ODDS!? It wasn't scary, the ending was incredibly stupid, it had what seemed to be a token black man who had stereotypical one liners and wasn't really necessary. I kind of had the idea it would be lame, after all, it did open up with Fall Out Boy's 'Sugar, We're Going Down.' and not a descent soundtrack. I have no idea why the editor didn't bring it back to the director and say 'Change it, all of it. Just start over.', and the acting was a mess. In conclusion, I hated this movie, it was a waste of time and money, I slap myself for going to see it. However, if you want a good laugh...then I guess you should watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well so far everyone seems to have loved this. Not! Someone must tell those movie producers that if it ain't broke don't fix it! Glad I didn't see this at the flicks. The original 1980 version is far the better of the two. OK this one has better make-up with the ghosts and more of them than 6 and I gave most of my marks for the glass bit. Sorry Selma for me you where no Adrianne sexily breathing words of love in an isolated lighthouse. And I think the louder music actually detracted from the atmosphere. In the first movie this bothered me but now I see why they used that, we don't have to pay royalties stuff, because it actually added to the movie. One cant be sexy and play loud music, no matter how 'Now' it is. Maggie Grace was no Jamie Lee either, standing on the darkened road trying to hitch a lift with a stranger, not an old boyfriend, where they picked up where they left off. Yeh Right! And then the writers having not much to say picked out lines from the first movie and spliced it into theirs. Wrong! If you are going to make a remake--well Don't! Oh and Maggie being the reincarnation of the original Elizabeth well if she was then why wheren't they re-incarnated? Why where they stuck in fogsville? Why didn't they just move on, if that was the case. All in all listen to the advice of the others and keep looking for another movie as you wander around your DVD store. Do not stop in front of this one and if you do Don't pick it up and if you do don't pay for it and take it home. You have been warned</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I could have to agree with NateF88 from ILL. The movie was awful compared to the original! Old saying goes, if it's not broke, don't fix it! Well I see Hollywood managed to take a great movie and just screw it up! As far as all of the mistakes in filming go, you can blame that n the film editors!!! They are not worth a plug nickel now days! What a shame! I don't even work in film and I could do a better job editing the films without 99.9% of the mistakes they make! Here you call yourselves film editors??? I wasted my money on the new one, when I should have bought the 1980 ver. (much better)scared the hell out of me! Do yourselves a favor and don't waste your money and buy the new one! (buy the 1980 version) licks butt! Some things are just better left alone! Take the word of NateF88! He did his homework! I checked it out! Maybe they should give him and I a job in Hollywood? We couldn't possibly do worse!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't this one on the bottom 100?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If nothing else, the decade following the year 2000 will be remembered as an era of remakes. Everything that has been made previously, be it a film or a video game, they have tried to make again, and with rather mixed results at best. The Fog, an early John Carpenter film that demonstrated his enormous talent for making the simplest stories compelling, has failed to escape the trend. And it is a shame, too, because Carpenter himself would do well to stop revisiting his old glories and relearn what made him one of the most compelling storytellers of the early 1980s. If I could sum up this remake in just one word, it would be "pointless". I have not seen the original enough times to remember exactly what the conceit was about the ghosts that inhabited the fog of the original film, but this remake attempts to elaborate on all of the details, and strangely manages to add nothing. The script is a verbatim copy of the 1980 original for the most part, except it tries to explain the deeper motives of the fog-spirits, and thus makes them a lot less menacing.The most obvious element to go wrong in this mess is the cast. The original had a cast that, while not lining up for awards, could put on a good performance that sold the story. In place of Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, and Janet Leigh, we have Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair. Tom Atkins may have always looked like he drank his salary on each film, but he at least delivered his lines in something other than a whine. His equivalent in this film, Welling, is such a timid excuse for a hero one rarely knows whether to wish he would hurry up and die or wish one could punch him. Selma, on the other hand, does a better job in the Adrienne Barbeau role than the film deserves. When done up right, she can actually be quite pleasant to look at. It's just such a pity that the rest of the cast has such a high suck factor that one never really gets into the mood of the story. And that is what made the 1980 version so great. Because one cared for the characters, one got into the film, and it worked.I also have no idea who edited this dross, but they deserve a good slap in the face, too. Much of the back story involving a profitable trading colony becoming infected with leprosy and fleeing in search of greener pastures is shown in flashback. Granted, I would have used flashback to tell this story, too, but at the right moments. The Fog circa 2005 has so many flashbacks scattered throughout its running length in order to illustrate parallels between past and present that one becomes numb to them just as they are about to illustrate their story point. Horror films of all walks can suffer for having an element overused to the point where the audience becomes tired of it or even bored with it. The contrast between the original Nightmare On Elm Street films and the obviously toned-down to appeal to the juvenile audiences fourth and fifth episodes in the franchise is a good example of what I mean. Think of The Fog circa 1980 as the original NOES, and its 2005 equivalent as the Renny Harlin butchery. Yes, this new Fog really does get that trite.I must also make a special mention of the Sony Pictures DVD that was released in Region 4, not because it represents the film well, but rather, because it does not. It may have affected my enjoyment of this film even more, because the image quality of the DVD is, to put it nicely, terrible. It is not as bad as the independent releases of neglected films like Dune that are often released here, don't get me wrong, but there is literally so much posterisation, macro-blocking, and mosquito noise during scenes in which we see the titular fog that one could be forgiven for thinking they were watching a VCD. Don't get me wrong, the film is still a piece of manure, but this does tend to affect my enjoyment even more. After all, how can I enjoy the spoils of something being so bad it's... bad, if I cannot help but think of how dodgy the picture looks? Not that these scenes would have had the tiniest shred of suspense otherwise, but this is really letting the side down.Anyway, everything here smacks of convenience. When we want to make a death scene that is, to the credit of the filmmakers, impressively gory, the fog kills on contact. When it is near the top-billed stars, it does everything from stand still when it gets too close to move backwards away from them. This inconsistent approach to the "villain" of the piece has killed many would-be horror films before, but it is amazing to see it done with such aplomb here. Having a graveyard across the road from a town hall is not too far out, and I think a lot of towns would attract less ill-will from disgruntled residents if they were this honest about their effects on residents. But when a town supposedly this remote and isolated that it only seems to have ten residents who all know each other can get internet connections to broadcast web camera video with that kind of resolution, you know reality has taken a rolling turn off the road. Don't even get me started on the computer failure shown at one point.All up, this 2005 remake of The Fog is a desecration of a memento from a time when films were allowed to aim for an adult audience, whose intelligence it respected.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes you have to ask yourself why they bothered....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is very little right about this movie. From unresolved plot points, to very poor scripting, this remake should never have been made. The two leads have absolutely zero chemistry, the audience cares not a whit about either one. Tom Welling is absolutely wooden, he is given a smart Aleck, wise-cracking black sidekick as an obvious ploy to appeal to the greatest number of young people, and a returning girlfriend played by "Lost"'s Maggie Grace. This movie in just one long horror-movie cliché; it has all the usual low-budget bits from every B-movie ever released and absolutely nothing original.It's really too bad, because the actual story is pretty good as horror movies go. The founding fathers of an island town were in reality a bunch of murdering thieves, and their leper victims have returned 130 years later to exact revenge upon their ancestors. But Rupert Wainright completely botched what could have been a fine tale. Why are these ghosts obsessed with breaking glass? Why is that? At the very beginning, instead of offing the stereotypical scantily clad females in a ghostlike manner, they are simply thrown through windows. On a boat, in the middle of the ocean.... that's the best the scriptwriter could come up with? And why start it off that way anyway, the way every single other low-budget horror movie has ever started, with unnamed extras being dispatched in a predictable manner? Fast forward to Tom Welling discovering his boat is missing. They take a speedboat out and instantly find the missing vessel (small ocean). Then they discover 3 bodies, all having suffered violent deaths, and what do they do? Well Maggie rushes into the deepest, darkest part of the ship of course. She opens a giant freezer, just like anyone would do after discovering 3 mutilated corpses. Then with the bodies and ship safely back at the harbour, instead of handing over what is obviously pretty compelling evidence to the police, Tom Welling implores his girlfriend to hide the camcorder? For what purpose exactly? Because it might provide evidence that his friend and shipmate, the only survivor, is innocent of the crime? So he asks her to hide it? What......? She promptly finds a spot where she can watch the video on her own, determines that his friend is indeed innocent and then...... loses the camera into the water because she was walking on a very narrow wet beam? What???? She never seems to be overly concerned that the only proof that Nick's friend is innocent has just been lost due to her carelessness. And she conveniently finds an old journal walled up inches above the waterline (after playing around in some old fishing net which mysteriously envelopes her), behind bricks so loosely placed that the journal would have washed away 100 years ago? She also makes no attempt to retrieve the camcorder (even though it is in no more than 15 feet of water).The morgue on this island seems remarkably easy to access, because old Maggie just wanders back there to check on all 3 bodies without anyone so much as batting an eye. No one seems at all concerned that they run in there, find her screaming over a corpse at least 50 feet from his gurney, and no one even bothers to ask her what happened? Or to care that she just dragged that corpse (I mean, were we supposed to think that they all knew it got up and walked over to her????). Later on, poor old Spooner (the wisecracking sidekick) is at the hospital under guard, on suspicion of brutally murdering 3 people, and he just gets up and goes out the window? And his plan? He is going to take a ship off the island! At night, in the middle of the same dense fog he witnessed kill 3 people! Man, his character isn't too bright. That is the best the scriptwriter could do? And the Fog is supposedly killing people related to the original founding fathers, so the innocent extras are killed for exactly what reason? And why is it clearly spelled out that Nick Castle has the same name as one of the Fathers, yet the ghosts never once go after him? Even after they dispatch the mayor, old Nicky runs out into the graveyard to watch, but no ghost even bats a translucent eyelid? Not to mention that scene added yet again to the broken glass theme running rampant through this disaster.... And what type of ocean does Selma Blair fall into anyway? Her car goes off a 30-foot cliff, she swims out and then manages to find her son 5 minutes later, after apparently getting both a blow-dry and a dry-cleaning? Plus she has an amazing propensity for finding her son considering that her car went off the road out in the middle of nowhere. And why exactly did Elizabeth go off to join the ghosts at the end? She was the reincarnation of the original Elizabeth? OK....... except that her mother was a descendant of one of the founding fathers, therefore she was most certainly not the ghosts original wife, rather she was one of the ones they came back to kill! So she had been having nightmares for what reason exactly? Ah, why bother? The plot holes are so many, the movie was just SO LOUSY, this is lazy film-making at its worst. Is anyone surprised that the scriptwriter also wrote the incredible bomb "The Core" ? Or that the director Rupert Wainwright's chief contribution to "The Arts" has been a score of rap videos? It shows baby, IT SHOWS! R.</fullReview>

Why is there not one aspect of the story that isn't 100% predictable and linear?I'm not usually a harsh critic of horror I love the genre and will watch just about anything - I even liked cabin fever - but i have to draw the line at 'the fog' (not worthy of capital letters).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has not gotten over its John Carpenter remakes, and The Fog is the latest in a series. From the trailers, we were teased that "there is something in the fog", but we do not know what. And no, despite being nice to look at and all, the Fog is not at all suffocating.Antonio Island is celebrating its founding fathers, and we're introduced to the descendants of the Malones, the Waynes, the Castels and the Williams. Tom Welling (Clark Kent in the Smallville television series) stars as Nick Castle, the hero of the story who runs a washout boat business. Maggie Grace stars as Elizabeth Williams, Nick's girlfriend who has returned to the island and somehow feels responsible for the events that transpired when the fog descents. Selma Blair stars as Stevie Wayne, a single parent running the only radio channel up atop the only lighthouse on the island.Pretty standard fare, one-dimensional characters. What will probably keep you engaged in the movie, is the quest to discover the truth and back story to the entire fog shenanigans. A mysterious menacing looking fog arrives, contrary to physics and wind directions, and strange killings and happenings occur on the island. Age old objects like a hairbrush and timepiece turn up at the beach, and itchy-handed folks pick it up despite us folks knowing bad things will happen.But it bores you after a while, with its usual sins of the fathers theme having little depth (ok, so it's a horror flick after all). It's simple, but with potential, which degenerates into almost a Pirates of the Caribbean copycat in the special effects department. And the special effects and makeup could perhaps be the only saving grace in this movie. There are loopholes in the storyline, especially the ending. You understand what the filmmakers are trying to suggest, but it just doesn't make much sense anyway.Is it frightening? No. It's a tame pussycat in its scares, relying on cheap, loud, clanging and knocking of metal three times to signal the demise of the characters who hear them, knowing that Evil is around and knocking at your door. Any more, you'll probably go deaf with the theatre's surround sound system.If there's a movie like The Fog which can be made, perhaps someone would be bold enough to make The Mist, or The Haze in local context. Don't waste your time, you'll need strong fog-lamps to attempt to look at the good in this picture. Being a Tom Welling groupie fan, will probably help.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad...If They Hadn't Named It, "The Fog." Otherwise, a 7.8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a remake of Carpenter's, "The Fog," this is probably one of the worst remake/sequels I've seen. There are too many key elements from Carpenter's original work, which have been left out, written around, and/or ignored.As a stand alone movie (a movie all to itself without any comparison to any previous work), I find it well done and highly intriguing and would rate it near a 7.8/10.But...it IS a remake and not a stand alone movie, and that is what this review intends to reflect.The first thing you notice is that Elizabeth and Nick now know one another. In the morgue scene when Elizabeth is accosted by the corpse, in this version Nick doesn't witness the near-mugging and therefore has to be convinced that Elizabeth is not only sane, but truthful! Poor little Elizabeth is crying out for the attention she never received from her mother, blah blah psychobabbly blah. Nick now has a sidekick who is a PC nightmare. And on top of the other inconsistencies, the two parts formerly played by mother and daughter (Janet Leigh and Jamie Lee Curtis) are now portrayed by two lesser actresses whose CHARACTERS are mother and daughter. If this was meant to be an homage, it was a wasted attempt, in my book. Also among the myriad of rewritten material, Elizabeth is the one who discovered the truth about the town's forebears, instead of the priest. I guess they had to satisfy contractual screen time obligations. Elizabeth is now written into an unextraordinary love story subplot, not with Nick (well, sorta, but it's such a mess!), but with the spirit/ghost of Captain Blake! And Steevie Waye no longer remains at her post during the besieging of the town by The Fog, but instead shows herself to be a gutsy single mom who would die for her kid. The fact that Elizabeth and Nick are now not strangers, but old flames, apparently eliminated the need for character development. Speaking of these characters, they are standardized, generic, cookie-cutter, cardboard cutouts of some of the worst stereotyping I've seen since Zorro, the Gay Blade! The casting choice of Selma Blair as Steevie Wayne was less than brilliant. While I enjoy her performances (and this one is no exception), her voice could not begin to rival that of Adrienne Barbeau! Her going after her son instead of Nick and Elizabeth being the sole people looking for him was just another stereo-typically based contrivance to satisfy Selma's screen time obligations by getting her character OUT of that light house and into the town where she could get more camera time. Maggie Grace is NO Jamie Lee Curtis, and Cole Heppell turned in a performance inferior to that of Courtland Mead's in King's lesser remake of, "The Shining!" Cole has, in fact, even worked on prior Steven King installments of the Dead Zone. Go figure. DeRay Davis plays "Spooner," an ebonicized slacker with a street name stolen from, "I, Robot," and tacked onto a ghetto personality for "color" and comedic effect. Some social program MAY have procured the role for him, but if that is the case it didn't do him any favors. His character was completely superfluous to this work. His was not even a decently written peripheral character. I have to say that I LOVED the effects! I have really looked and I cannot find one instance of badly edited footage or unrealistic CGI! It's just too bad they were done for this. And after all that, the worst thing is that this remake fails to follow the novel any more closely than Carpenter's version did. While it may be enjoyable, it's NOT The Fog.The worst quote of the movie? DeRay Davis's Spooner shouting, "Well leave my family out of this! We're from Chicago!"This rates a 5.6/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You don't want to waste money on this stinker. However, you may get a glimpse of entertainment out of it by counting the ways in which it is wrong. Hence the three stars. Anyway, there's so much wrong that you don't have a chance of getting scared. Out of my mind: - The CGI fog looks awful.- The attack on the Seagrass is utterly lame. You don't see what killed the girls. They're just thrown through the window, dead. Watch the few tiny scratches on their faces carefully, because this will be the only blood in the whole movie!- Why did that dude on the Seagrass survive? Are the ghosts scared of fridges or something? What does his survival add to the story anyway?- What's the point of the video tape showing that the dude is innocent of the murders? Just to let it accidentally be dropped into water by the stupid blonde girl? And when she's visiting him in hospital, with police around, why the heck doesn't she at least tell them that she has seen on tape that he's innocent? Gosh!- When the ghosts encounter the girl at home, why do they suddenly leave? There's no clock bell or anything indicating that the ghost hour or whatever is over.- Why does that girl have those flash backs? Let alone, why's she leaving with Blake? Oh, probably because of some reincarnation mumbojumbo which is unfortunately never explained.- With all the effort spent on those flash backs, why isn't it even explained where Blake and his people were coming from and what disease they were suffering from?- Why do the ghosts kill a dog? They don't have a reason for that. And why is the dog owner rotting? Oh, maybe that's the leprosy that is never mentioned?- Why does Father Malone know all along what's going on? Because of some silly graffiti!? So those stone old ghosts make graffities?- Did I mention that there's no blood? There's not even blood when Father Malone is stabbed right through his chest by some - whoo, scary - flying glass.- Where are the hacking and slaying zombie seamen, anyway? I want my zombie seamen back! Not those boring invisible somethings with their stupid telekinetic tricks.- And where are the hooks and sabres? I want my hooks and sabres back, too! Blake should be knocking at doors with a scary hook, not with a dull staff.- What's the point of those loud knocking sounds coming out of nowhere all the time?- What's the point of bringing the metal detector guy into the story? Oh, to raise the body count and let him die in a boring and senseless way, like the girls. My bad.- Where are those many ghosts at the end coming from? There weren't that many people on Blake's ship.- Why did Selma Blair choose to participate in this mess?Oh well. At least the movie makes you appreciate John Carpenter's original as the gem that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hardly satisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of the John Carpenter film is hardly satisfying. While the John Carpenter film was low on thrills, it sure had an interesting premise. The moody setting was pretty much intriguing and so were the characters. But this 2005 film has the thrills alright, thanks to the enhanced special effects and make-up, but it is low on substance. The characters are cardboard-like. The incredible premise seems too hackneyed. Further the effort to make this spooky film almost shows throughout the film. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are both okayish, and they sure would have done well in a better film. It is a lesson to all that remakes are a strict no-no, unless they are made with the intent of making something better and more contemporary.</fullReview>

Be prepared to endure a storyline that often does not make sense, and i know it's a cliché in horror movies for the characters to do dumb things but there are points in this film that truly show it up as a work of fiction, and as we all know, the reason why horror movies can be so good is because of how real they can seem.

We watched the first half hour of the movie in silence, giving it a chance, but after that we kept giving comment. The script was either Dreadful or hilarious, but not terrifying, as I was told. I got the idea that there were one or two very intelligent people working on this movie, but they were either ignored, or their ideas got molested. The priest was attempted to be mysterious, which made him everything but -. And you could predict every scene, from the second it started. A Guy leans over to look at the water, he gets pulled in. She falls into the water, loses the evidence of another guy's innocence, a guy that goes free anyway? She is assaulted, dragged under water, but aha, she escapes, and thus finds a book, which was, weirdly, hidden in a wall. And, at the end of the movie, everybody throws away the evidence. there are a few feeble attempts at being cool, which are spoiled, simply because the movie isn't supposed to be cool, whatever it IS supposed to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where did all the real horror films go? Too often these days we're subjected to tame crap that is designed to scare 12-year-old girls only. How much more rubbish like Darkness Falls, Skeleton Key and The Grudge do we really have to suffer? Where are all the risk-takers and controversy. Are we really that naive these days that trash like The Fog gets green-lighted before a script is even written? There is no need for this remake to exist. Well, there's the money of course. But Sony make so much money of their frequently awful Revolution/Screen Gems films that the budget could have went to something better. Of all the films to remake, The Fog is a strange choice.John Carpenter didn't even like the original. He called it one of the lowest points of his career (the man who's last film was Ghosts of Mars!) and he had to insert more 'spookiness' at the last minute because it was so boring. This remake doesn't even have that much sense.I know I'm wasting my time here, but if you want a rundown of the plot it sort of goes like this; a small town in the pacific northwest comes under siege from a gang of zombie ghosts from the sea who hide in a menacing fog. And that is it! But it takes so goddamn long to even get to this simple-minded idea I had honestly grown a beard by the time anything the slightest bit interesting began to happen.Tom Welling or stock-hunk hero is about as wooden as a Trojan Horse and he wanders, almost comatose, from scene-to-scene acting only as an observer to the dull horror on show. Selma Blair, looking prettier with long hair, snores her way through a thankless role and the generic blonde girlfriend of Tom Welling suffers inexplicable flashbacks to 100 years ago as a way of explaining to the audience what's going on. So there's your cast of characters. Not one of them is worth any slightest bit of attention.The script revels in clichés and clumsiness. Characters are killed one by one and none of them survive to warn the others. A dead guy comes back to life for no reason and scares Ms Generic Blonde. But obviously no one is there to see it happening and don't believe her stories until it's too late. Ooh, there are ghosts after me! I better run for it! But the car won't start! Something's wrong with the ignition! The computer generated fog isn't scary in the slightest. The actual fog effects do look quite cool but there ain't no atmosphere. Director Rupert Wainwright tries to fill in the blanks with some loud sound effects but he's hopeless at pulling off any perfectly-timed scares or wringing any kind of sense out of the story.Don't get me wrong, I do like silly horror films. But they have to be imaginative and full of life. The Fog plods along clueless and only seems intent on boring the audience to death. There is not one drop of blood in the entire 100 minutes.Oh, man. This film is so bad it's not even inspiring me to creatively bash it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Entirely Bad but it's Still a Major Disappointment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot centres around the quaint, charming sea-side town of "Antonio Bay". Without warning, a mysterious, thick fog rolls in carrying the murderous ghosts of lepers who were wrongfully killed in a shipwreck a century earlier. The townspeople need to solve this mystery before days end or they will fall victim to the fog's fury.The original "Fog" has always been one of my favourite John Carpenter films behind "Halloween" of course. It offers a great cast (Adrienne Barbeau, Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, John Houseman), built-up tension, an eerie Carpenter score, a great location and a bone-chilling ghost story. Although it's not perfect, it works.The remake offers an attractive, younger cast (Tom Welling, Selma Blair, Maggie Grace) and expensive CGI effects. The story remains the same but somehow the film-makers got rid of the much-needed suspense. There is no sense of threat or tension in the air despite the violent, black, CGI created fog that is constantly on display. They even changed the ghosts form of execution of it's victims which in my opinion, was a huge mistake. In the original film, the wronged ghosts appear as three- dimensional beings. They're covered in rags, dripping in salt water and armed with every sharp, metallic object you can think of; swords, hooks, knives. It was like watching "Night Of The Living Dead" and "Halloween" all rolled into one. The idea was original and deeply chilling. The remake tried to make the murders seem more ghostly by not taking the original's approach and there were added embellishments to the story that were not necessary and didn't work. Instead of inspiring fear in the movie theatre I watched this in, it inspired bursts of laughter from the audience.This film is still far superior to some other horror atrocities released from Hollywood in the last couple of years or so (did someone say "Boogeyman"??) but it's still a major disappointment. Especially when you take the budget and talent into consideration. For those who have not seen the original, I recommend watching it instead. Despite it's low-budget, it's a far more effective and satisfying shocker. Bigger is not always better and "The Fog" (2005) is a prime example.This "Fog" is too thick for it's own good.Recommended to undiscriminating "horror" film fans only.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Today's forecast calls for a 100 percent chance of lame</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sigh. Where to begin. Let's start with this statement - The remake of "The Fog" makes John Carpenter's original look like "Citizen Kane." It's bad. Really bad. Not much more I can say.I'll refrain from rehashing the plot, but here are some general thoughts and questions. Spoilers ahead, kids.1. Why didn't Superboy and what's-her-name from "Lost" find it odd when the windows of their truck all blew out? Does that happen all the time on this island? And how did that get fixed by the movie's end? 2. The two girls dancing on the boat - HILARIOUS.3. How come everyone on the island over the age of 25 is either a raving idiot, a crazy drunk or an insolent prick? 4. Could they have made the sidekick character any more of a racist cariacture? 5. I bet Selma Blair's radio station doesn't make much money. Especially since she keeps running out of the lighthouse.6. Scotch tape is great for wrapping presents, and keeping ghosts at bay.7. Note to would-be directors: When in doubt, throw in a few car crashes. Nothing says "Ghost Story" like a car crash.8. If you have a friend accused of killing three people, and you find a camcorder that might clear him, why not go ahead and turn that crucial bit of evidence on over to the police? 9. Sometimes things are scarier when they're left unseen.10. About that "twist" ending. Aside from her whacky flashback dreams, there was no evidence to support that ending. It was a cop out, and a crappy one at that, considering the fact that she had a mom that lived on the island. Ugh. Whatever. I want my money back.</fullReview>

Though it stars a few excellent actors/actresses, the lead female actress drove me crazy throughout the whole movie. It differed from the first totally. I would gladly recommend the first to everyone I know and have - but I urge everyone not to see this one unless they want total unexplainable action, scenes that don't make a bit of sense, bad special effects and too many at that, and a movie being totally ruined by the company who made it. This film should go down as the worst one made for 2005 in every way possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possibly the worst remake since 1998's PSYCHO (and yes I've seen the new AMITYVILLE HORROR); any kind of attempt at reviewing this stinker seems to start turning into a list. How many things can you POSSIBLY get wrong in a horror movie that obviously had some money to spare and great source material? (The original 1980 version, even though 25 years younger than this film, is better acted, written, directed, scored, shot...heck, even the effects were better). To start...Tom Welling might be passable as Superman on a made for cable TV series (think about that), but a small town island fisherman? Maybe on Abercrombie Island, where all you need are shaved pecs. And Maggie Grace? True her character makes no sense, but even a mildly competent actress could have at least made the character Likable. At least Selma Blair tries, though her character is so underwritten she barely registers.There are so many blunders in this film it's impossible to count. Why set a character in a perfect horror movie spot like a lighthouse and then never use it? And why does one character wander aimlessly on a dark road in the middle of the night after traveling from New York? No cabs? No friends? And why do the ghosts look like the Disney Haunted Mansion ghosts? And why is the fog so thick in some shots, but when we need to see the action, is it nowhere to be found anywhere around? And why are more people not offended when viewing the 800th movie where the black character is relegated to stereotype comic relief? And where are all the townspeople when all this is going on downtown? And why do windshields shatter in one scene to make the audience jump, but appear fine in the very next scene? And why introduce a subplot about a love triangle, then never mention it again? And...and...and...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not seen this movie yet myself, but I have seen the trailer, and to tell the truth, it looks pretty funny. It's basically one of those modern-day Hollywood films; it sucks. I did not see one person over the age of 40 on the casting list (if i'm wrong, don't correct me), which means they don't have the cool pirate guy at the beginning. Anyways, do yourself a favor, SEE THE ORIGINAL FOG BEOFRE SEEING THIS MOVIE. I need a good laugh, so I'm gonna go see it (fog 2005) this weekend, to see how much Hollywood has ruined a Carpenter film with 20-year old actors, CGI pervading every scene, and of course, a horrible (music) score. PLEASE GO OUT AND SEE THE ORIGINAL FOG, AS THAT WAS A VERY GOOD MOVIE, AND THEN SEE THIS MOVIE. JOHN CARPENTER DESERVES BETTER THAN TO HAVE Hollywood REMAKE HIS FILMS. I wonder what's next? Remakes of T.V. show episodes? Ooops, too late.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An isolated Northern California town is encompassed by an eerie fog, which starts killing off the inhabitants one-by-one. Little do the survivors realize that there's a deadly mystery hidden in the town's past that has come back to get revenge.The original film is pretty good. It isn't great but it is entertaining to watch. The remake is the type of horror film you expect to come out in January. It was very disappointing and it offered very few scares. They changed the story a little. The characters are younger and the two main characters know each other. There are also a few other changes though it doesn't matter since the film is bad.The acting is horrendous and brought the film down quite a bit. Tom Welling is okay in Smallville but he can't carry a major film. His reactions and overall performance is very bad. Maggie Grace takes the role of Elizabeth and gives a horrible performance. I wasn't expecting her to be as good as Jamie Lee Curtis. However, I was expecting at least a mediocre performance but instead she gives one of the worst performances this year. Selma Blair plays Stevie Wayne and she does a decent job. She is no Adrienne Barbeau but she is pretty good when compared to Tom Welling and Maggie Grace.Rupert Wainwright should probably get the blame for making such a horrible film. He just tries to get as many cheap thrills in there as possible without really trying to move the story along. The story and characters develop poorly and the ending is also poorly done. The ending is so absurd and so random that it kills the film completely. He ends the film awkwardly without really explaining of what just happened. This is the same director that made Blank Check and Stigmata so there's no surprise the film turned out to be a dud.I also blame the studio for releasing such an atrocious film since they were probably pushing for a PG-13 horror film. If it was rated R, I'm certain that the film would have been so much better. Of course, the studio was more concerned about money (which makes sense) and the final result is not good. In the end, The Fog offers very little in scares and creativity and it's not worth watching at all. I would recommend going out and renting the original which was a lot better. Rating 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog remake is 2005's worst horror movie... * out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Woo Wee! This here is one stinker of a movie and an insult to both Carpenter's original and the entire horror genre.In the original the radio host was a respectable likable lady. Here she just seems like a slut. She's not the only unlikeable character in the movie... in fact EVERYONE here is unlikeable. GO PIRATES! Oh yeah... you don't really root for them either. Basically the people who made this movie didn't realize what made the original so good. It's the mood and atmosphere. It's the way you really can't see those pirates except their silhouettes. It's the way the characters didn't look like they came straight out of an Abercrombie catalog. It's the way the music helped to create a sense of unease.Speaking of music, I have nothing against orchestrated scores, I'm a huge score buff. But in certain horror movies it's best to throw away the baton and get a guy with a Roland. It just is.Also this features one of THE worst overly CG'd death scenes in the entire history of cinema. It's when the nanny's flesh starts to rot or burn or whatever when those arms reach out and grab her. Boy what a wretched eye roller of a death. I'm all for CGI in a space epic or something like that. It even works to a degree in a horror films, but not a scene like this. CGI hasn't got to the point where a death scene like this looks genuine. It looks TERRIBLE. Get out the prosthetics and make up for once! GEEZ! Speaking of scenes that make your eyes roll... I should have known the obligatory 'kids partying on the boat' scene was coming up. With the token black guy who always has something funny to say of course.BOO! I want my money back.I'm giving it one star since I liked the way the fog chased the kid. But you saw most of that in the trailer.Clusters of hemorrhoids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could have been so much better. If you're going to do a remake, you should definitely do it WAY better than the original would have been! When I saw the previews, I thought it would be interesting to see what the fog was and why it wanted to kill people, but it was actually really stupid. First of all, the lepers wanted to get even with the founding fathers....so why kill the girls on the boat? I mean they weren't related to any of them! I can understand the cousin of Castle, but come on, he died AFTER the two girls. And what was the deal with Elizabeth? Why would the reincarnation of the leper leader be an ancestor to one of the founders the "zombies" wanted to kill? The movie was dull, completely devoid of scares for anyone but the little boy playing Selma Blairs son. Pretty good acting....crappy script...two thumbs WAY down!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm afraid I can't look at this film without comparison to the original. Now, I like it when filmmakers attempt a remake with variations, little changes to set it apart, but I did not like a lot of the changes here. There were some good elements, but overall it is just disappointing to see a film with nonsensical moments.The spoiler alertFirst of all, The good bits:Selma blair did a decent job I liked the Father Malone character. The Fog effects were creepy enoughOK, now the crap:Why didn't the ghosts kill Nick Castle? They go after all the others related to the Founders, but not him. I call bullshit.Spooner's character and his whole subplot was an incredible waste of time and irritating as hell. Everyone on the fishing boat should have died. His excuse for surviving was pretty weakElizabeth's connection to the ghosts makes no sense, because she a descendant of the founders, but the ghosts exclude her and Nick from the slaughter (LAME!). The original cause for the ghosts to return was the gold, but here the motive is muddled. If it was revenge, they didn't finish the job.Several times people get into car wrecks and just walk away unscathed. Lame.Maggie's performance is just irritating, especially when she gets that smug look while talking about the tragic history of the community.Nick finds Spooner's camcorder, realizes it could prove Spooner is innocent of murder when the police take spooner in. What does he do? Gives it to Liz and just says "Keep it safe". Liz, of course, suggests giving it to the police, Nick says "Keep it safe". Senseless logic, Pointless subplot because it never matters when she loses it ANYWAY.The film, while having some decent moments, suffers from the standard "Pretty people syndrome", where the kids have all the solutions and the adults mostly don't have a clue.I shouldn't rip on this so badly, because it's not a terrible film, just disappointing compared to the original. The ending tried to set up a twist, but it was sort of lame. It's sad to see that what made older 70s/80s horror so excellent to watch become thought of as boring by today's "standards". Half the fun was the buildup of suspense, the rising horror and watching a competent cast play interesting, mature characters. So few scary movies today embrace that concept except as some dull obligation. Everything feels rushed. What these films need are older actors who can bring a better air of credibility.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll just say this and bring it to the table; The Fog ain't that bad.Have you clicked that "No" button yet? Great, I'll continue.First off, I don't understand why so many people are being so hostel towards this film and the people who like it. Everyone is allowed to have their own opinions. If someone liked this movie, let them, its OK! You are allowed to like it and you are allowed to hate it. Movies are made to entertain and if you were entertained by this, great! If not well, I'm sure there are other films that many other people hate but you like. Not everyone has to have the same thoughts about a film. I'm still amazed at some of the stuff that I read on these boards, the lack of courtesy is mind numbing.Rupert Wainwright's "Fog" was nowhere near as bad as so many have made it sound. There, I said it. I am literally, to this day, at a loss over the sheer overwhelming barrage of by-the-numbers negative reviews it has received since its initial release. Not just negative, mind you. These people are very literally picking this apart, weeding out each and every individual aspect they feel the director got wrong. What does that say about why we go to movies in the first place? When I pay to see a film, especially a horror film, I go in with the intent of forgetting my troubles and the harsh realities of the world I live in. Most people, I have noticed over time, seem to demand far too much perfection and realism from their films. To them I say, watch the nightly news. You will find all the unpleasant reality there you could ever want.Wainwright's retooling of "The Fog," while not as overly scary, is a fine companion piece to the landmark original. Some may disagree with that assessment. But, before anybody makes the foolhardy assumption that I don't know what I'm talking about, I will go on record and say that I have been an avid follower of horror for the last eightteen years of my life. I own John Carpenter's "Fog" on DVD and, like many here, hold that film in the highest regard. For the longest time, I have been struggling to understand why people who claim they are so steadfastly against the idea of remakes bother wasting their money to see them. I made the same argument in my review of the recent "Amityville Horror" remake. If somebody is already resigned to feeling bad about a remake, logic should dictate that they stay at home or pay to see something else. Such reasoning really doesn't get any simpler.Having said that, I really must be honest and tell everybody here that I did not see one single solitary thing wrong with this movie. Nothing at all. Spooner, that "token" black character people constantly whined about.......what was supposed to be so annoying about him? I take public transportation to work and see people far worse than him each and every day. The changes to the story that differ from Carpenter's original were all handled pretty well. The way some of these nitpickers have been talking, I went into this film expecting ninety minutes of audacious hellfire and brimstone. Well, as hard as I looked, I just didn't see anything that backed up all the negativity. Many people, too, it seemed had a problem with this newer film's ending. Why? What makes this ending so stupid and hard to swallow? Considering the dreams Elizabeth was having throughout the film, I thought the ending made perfect sense. Say whatever you want, but it worked.The main question I feel compelled to ask is: Did the fans who went to see this really believe they were going to see an exact carbon copy of the same original film? Folks, the original film was done twenty-six years ago! The world is a far different place than it was in 1980. Sensibilities have changed just as much as our own individual attitudes towards film. Rupert Wainwright is not John Carpenter. He has a completely different style and approach to film-making. While I do agree that this was not a blockbuster, in any real sense, I also do not believe it was the irredeemable garbage it has been unfairly labelled as. Many of the purists out there complained over the fact that it hit theaters with a PG-13. Why? The tone of this movie was really no different from Carpenter's. Had he released his version of the film today, it too would have received the same rating. It basically all goes back to what I said in my review for "Darkness Falls," and it bears repeating here. Every single horror film, contrary to popular opinion, does not have to be a gratuitous bloodbath to get me in line at the ticket booth. All this idiocy is why I take simple word of mouth for what it is. I'm not disrespecting anybody else's opinion of this film, because that's not what I'm about as a person. But, you'd better believe I'm standing by mine. Regardless of what anybody says, this was not a bad movie. "House of the Dead," yeah, definitely. This one, no, not even close.Enough with all the nitpicking please. If you can't commit yourself to suspending disbelief in horror, fantasy, or science fiction, you plain and simply have no business watching it. Sorry for this rant, but somebody had to say it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As remakes go, this is one of the worst</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the horror remakes being made in the past few years, this one has to be one of the dreariest. I still think the execrable WHEN A STRNGER CALLS is the worst of all time, but in places THE FOG comes close. This is a laboured, labouring film that attempts to emulate the John Carpenter original with no success. While the Carpenter film isn't a favourite of mine, it is a solid little ghost story that has more about it than some, but THE FOG falls far short of these standards. It's a teen horror film, nothing more nothing less, and it never should have been released.The simply awful Maggie Grace stars as a young woman who returns to the populated island where she once lived. Little does she know that the residents are about to be besieged by the ghosts of some lepers who were burned to death over a century before. The plot sticks fairly closely to the original, but the characters are nowhere near as interesting and the actors are laughable. We had Tom Adkins and Adrienne Barbeau in the first film; here we get dumb male model Tom Welling and the aforementioned Grace, who is so pathetic an actress as to be laughable. Selma Blair, taking the role that Barbeau essayed in the first, is the only one who seems to be trying to give an actual performance but even her attempts at edginess fail constantly.This film takes an age to get going and virtually nothing happens in the first hour. Scenes are disjointed and there are so many pointless sub-plots and unfathomable ingredients that you get the feeling that heavy editing took place during the post-production process to try and generate some interest in this mess. The fog itself is a not-bad CGI effect, but the ghosts ? when they eventually show up ? look like nothing more than the ghost army in LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING. I could appreciate that special effect in a fantasy film, but not in a supposedly realistic horror like this.The producers have gone for a child-friendly rating which means that there isn't a drop of blood in sight. I'm sorry, but I far prefer full-blooded horror films to the lukewarm pretend ones, and how can you see a guy getting shards of broken glass slicing through his body without him bleeding in the slightest. Even the over-the-top blood sprays of Japanese samurai flicks are more realistic than the non-existent bloodshed in evidence here. At times I felt like I was watching a PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN film rather than a supposed horror outing. And don't get me started on the 'twist' ending. I love twists at the end of films but this is one of those nonsensical ones that has been shoehorned in at the last minute and makes absolutely no sense if you sit back and think about what's happened in the rest of the film. What a mess.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though many have said a great deal of negative things about this movie, and on many counts I totally agree, I believe that The Fog has a great deal of potential. The acting would probably have been better if they brought in a set of toddlers and gave them the scripts (sarcasm). The best actor was Elizabeth, but that is not saying much. What this story needs is a descent director and a better budget. The computer animation was fairly well done as 2005 movies go. No, what this story needs is someone to streamline the progression of the plot and add more character development while also adding a scare factor greater than negative five. Much of the story, while intriguing, was marred by the bad acting and a management team that deserved to be fired. I, personally, am hoping to see another remake of The Fog in the next decade or so, and when it happens I would very much like to be on the staff or better yet the editor.</fullReview>

By comparison the original is more of a live action comedy cartoon than a horror film.The film takes place in Oregon. Although it does look a lot like Oregon the film was actually shot in British Columbia, which was part of Oregon Country.If you're a fan of horror or ghost stories than give this film a shot. It's a contemporary re-imagining of the original film and it even pays tribute faithfully to the original. The back story that the film used to explain the fog was pretty cool and makes a lot of sense. Not a great film but a well made effort. I really enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To start off the original Fog despite any flaws it may have had (personally I don't think it had any) was a truly brilliant, chilling, and genuinely terrifying horror movie .The movie was also disturbing without being gory which they also got right .The fact that you don't see an ounce of violence in this film yet having your imagination fill in the blanks of the gross mutilation sounds you hear when the victims are killed is a perfect example of how genius John Carpenter was especially back then.The remake however ...well let me get the good out of the way first .Good : special effects were creepy at times I really liked it at the beginning when the fog slowly swirled around the boat then entered it .That's about it for the good .The bad however is too excessive to list here .Bad : the acting especially the female lead who sleepwalked through the film and couldn't act if her life depended on it.The pathetic , boring, and unneeded exposition was also incredibly bad .In the original Fog they didn't need a backstory these pirates were simply evil and would kill anyone including a small innocent child .They made it clear in the original film that they were ambushed and murdered so they came back centuries later to get revenge on the descendants of those who killed them.The TWIST at the end was beyond laughable and it made absolutely no sense nor did the pointless story for that matter.Back to the acting none of the characters were remotely interesting in this film unlike the original where all the characters were immediately interesting .Selma Blair came across as a cardboard cutout and epitomized the words boring and bland.She did NOT do Adrienne Barbereau character in the original film justice period.She was also supposed to be a mother to a young boy but instead of Adriennes completely natural mother Selmas was more of an awkward friend or very distant relative not a mother.The actor who played the priest might as well been in the background considering how uninteresting his character and overall acting was.Now to Tom Welling this was when he was in his prime during the Smallville and Cheaper By The Dozen era .However that being said his acting was absolutely wooden and dull he was essentially lifeless as a character and as an actor it just sucked .Maggie Graces mom in the film also I've seen that actress in better movies and TV shows where she actually proved she COULD act .In this movie however she was the typical mean mom I've seen in so many other movies .The spirits also ?Horrible when I first saw that part under the water and the evil spirit it looked neat .Now mind you that was 2005 when I thought that now I know better.Now seeing it or simply looks like really cheap CGI.To end I would never recommend this movie but I would always highly recommend the classic original that movie is just awesome period .This movie only wished it could have even come close to the original but ultimately it wound up being a complete and utter failure .Oh and one last thing near the end you see the face of a spirit and all I can say is it was hilariously bad looking .You'll see what I mean if you watch it or have watched it.</fullReview>

Basically Antonio Island, off the coast of Oregon, is about to unveil a statue to honour the four men who founded the town in 1871, who founded their town in 1871: Patrick Malone (Christian Bocher), Norman Castle (Charles André), Richard Wayne (Yves Cameron) and David Williams (Douglas H. Arthurs). One of the descendants of the men, Norman Castle, is Nick Castle (Smallville's Tom Welling) owns a fishing charter company, his vessel the Seagrass is used for tourism, his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Taken's Maggie Grace) has spent six months in New York and has returned to the island. At a local radio station, host Stevie Wayne (Cruel Intentions' Selma Blair) gets a call from her weatherman that a large fog bank is approaching, this mysterious fog hits and a bizarre series of events begin to occur following it, including several gruesome deaths. After slipping into the sea Elizabeth happens upon an old journal from 1871, written by one of the town founders, Patrick Malone, telling how a man named Captain William Blake (Rade Sherbedgia) bought half of the island for use of a leper colony, on his ship, the Elizabeth Dane, Blake was betrayed by Castle, Wayne, Williams and Malone, he and the people on the ship were locked together, their possessions and money were stolen, and the ship was set on fire, killing everyone aboard. Returning after this flashback to the present day, the evil spirits of Blake and his crew, all turned into nasty looking pirate ghosts, have risen from their watery grave and returned to Antonio Island, seeking revenge on the descendants of the four men. Also starring DeRay Davis as Spooner, Kenneth Welsh as Tom Malone, Adrian Hough as Father Malone, Sara Botsford as Kathy Williams, Cole Heppell as Andy Wayne, Mary Black as Aunt Connie and Jonathon Young as Dan The Weatherman. I don't think there's any point mentioning Welling, Grace, Blair or anyone else, because I'd already seen the original I knew what to expect, the mystery element doesn't work, the special effects are only mildly good, the soundtrack is mixed, the only bit that got my attention was a woman being hit by the fog, melting and only her skeleton remaining, and the zombie-like marine invaders are pointless, this is definitely another fail at a remake, a rubbish horror film. Poor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog (2/10)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's not sugarcoat this at all? The remake of The Fog by Rupert Wainwright doesn't hold a candle at all to John Carpenter's original. An extended storyline in this film was based off the original revenge plot but it only muddied the waters and made the movie more complicated. Another thing about the remake, where are the townspeople and supporting roles, is there anybody that lives on this island besides the few casted actors and actresses? This leads to the atrocious acting or just completely forgettable roles by the cast, people were solely by their looks instead of talent. As a viewer it's understandable, glamorous, gorgeous actors/actresses might attract people to the theaters but it's no way going to be an impressionable movie in later years.The next thing that is about to be trashed is the special effects of the ghosts that were all extremely phony looking because of poor computer generated imagery. The Fog itself didn't look at all as menacing and the setting and cinematography of the area wasn't portrayed nearly as much as it should have been. The filming location was beautiful and it was a waste not to take advantage of the area more than they could have. The final aspect of the movie that is hateable about the film is the head-scratching ending, like what was the rational and point of this twist other than to make people mad. The bogus story, terrible acting, and lack of scary substance makes The Fog (2005) worthy enough to it's appearances in "worst of lists" as far as remakes go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as terrible as everyone makes it out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not that good but it is not as terrible as everyone makes it out to be. The original was done by John Carpenter. I believe John Carpenter would feel that it was done pretty good justice. It has removed the cheesy pirates that were in the original and replaced it with a more supernatural feel to it. Though some of the deaths in the movie are fairly cheap at times, I feel for a remake it is all around not bad. Anyone who enjoyed horror movies of the 70's &amp; 80's then you want to check it out. I enjoy goofy and great old school horror movies. When a remake is done it should be far superior than the original or at least attempt to. This movie stays very close to the original which I enjoyed. Again this is not a great movie and it is border line crappy but it is not as bad as everyone reviewing it makes it out to be. It's a good Halloween time movie to watch on TV if it comes on. As much as I love John Carpenter I feel this movie is definitely better than the original. Not a lot better but it still is. Don't go out of your way for this but if it's on and it's in the Spirit of Halloween time then give it a watch with a few beers. Take it for were it came from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, I don't usually write bad reviews but this movie is dreadful. The casting was awful, most of the acting was horrible and the story was filled with so many holes it is unbelievable that it made it to the theaters.They cast a comedian who can't act serious as the sidekick in a horror movie? There are shots of the girls who have their shirts pulled up on one side while doing the dishes just to show their underwear? The 2 main stars find 3 dead bodies on the boat so they split up and the girl hears a clank downstairs so she goes down there by herself right after finding 3 MURDERED bodies! The cop asks the mayor if he should arrest a murder suspect!!?? For some reason the 3 murders were filled on a personal camera on the boat but the cops don't take it into evidence, they just leave it on the boat...they don't even look at it!!I could go on and on.

		<fullReview>There is nothing scary about this cheap movie full of rip-off clichés. They are so desperate to get your attention that they even try to pander to racist viewers by blaming Leprosy disease on Chinese people. The acting is awful and painful to watch. The atmosphere is a complete joke. Not scary at all.The start of the movie is too rushed. They try to go into the fog thing too early. Then, it's foggy everywhere and they just throw in one stupid thing after the other. It doesn't work. It really shows Rupert Wainwright's lack of talent and originality. The only thing he does is copy and rip-off existing concepts. All supposedly action scenes are executed horribly. I started to get fed up with this movie really quickly.Stephen King's The Mist is the exact opposite of this terrible movie. Go watch that instead. Don't waste your time watching this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second remake in the same year for some of Carpenter's old classics and it doesn't seem like a lesson was learnt.The age old saying of less is more goes begging yet again folks. This glossy remake simply offers nothing that the original doesn't offer in a better way. There are no real thrills, chills or scares anyway in this extremely poor remake. Not to say that the original was really scary, it wasn't, but it had great atmosphere and more importantly was for an older audience.Yep you guessed it, this overly long remake is a PG-13 cert...oh good grief. The plot is of course nothing terribly scary, an old spooky sea yarn, but at least try for some genuine thrills and a creepy atmosphere. All you get is a pretty blonde boring teen screaming a lot, a token black guy, long drawn out effects which don't add anything and worse fog effects than the original!Some of the effects are nice admittedly but they aren't really needed, its like the plot, it just delves way too deep and goes on too long when it doesn't have to. A typical effect that shows the over the top nature of the production is the tsunami looking wave of fog that approaches the 'Seagrass'.Despite the plot being too long it still manages to not make a huge amount of sense right at the end. The ghost effects at the end are also laughable. A complete and utter mistake for all involved, could have been decent if made correctly but it wasn't. Devoid of anything remotely interesting or even slightly scary or spooky.2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No remake is as good as the Original movie and I agree with people who believe this too. I liked Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis in the original movie and I think the original was more scary than the remake. When I saw the original version I had nightmares for weeks. I mean sure it did have a few good moments in it but nothing spectacular happened like in the original version. I mean the original keep me on the edge of my seat and gave me goose bumps on my goose bumps, but this version was a total flop to me and that they should've never did a remake of it. When a movie is made, they should never do a remake of it because fans are going to be disappointed and want their money back because the movie didn't live up to their expectations and scare them or whatever, depending on the movie.</fullReview>

This is one of those movies you keep hoping will get better but it really does not. I think after about 10 to 15 minutes into it I started to get bored and a little while after that I started to get quite irritated. The actors are bad half the time it looks like the were also bored while making the movie (I would not blame them) Would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you want to waste about an hour and a half of your time and be very bored.

		<shortDescription>What A Waste Of An Opportunity to Deliver Good Cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember being a kid and going to the Double Drive In in Chicago and seeing the original "The Fog" and "The Howling" in the same night. Both of those movies scared the pants off of me and my siblings. Those were the days. This movie didn't spark a bit of nostalgia. In fact, it was so bad it probably couldn't have been any worse. No logic or intellectual stimulation of any sort. If I had gone to the theater to see this I would not have been a happy camper. I actually felt like the cast was a good selection, but the story line was really weak especially considering it was a remake. There was so much more that could have been accomplished here. It was a waste of an opportunity to deliver good remake of a horror classic. JM2C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog is a remake of the overrated 1980's film of the same name. Judged by the reviews on here I was expecting an appalling film. Although no classic and probably not quite as good as the original it is far from the worst movie I have ever seen. The original wasn't particularly scary and neither is this but there are some nice jump scenes and at least a bit of tension is built up. The acting is actually decent for a horror flick with Maggie Grace doing a good job of making you care what happens to the main protagonist. It's not the most original plot ever and is fairly predictable but if you watch this with an open mind it's not actually too bad at all. It is pretty gore free and relies more on creating an atmosphere so will not appeal to those looking for plenty of bloodshed. Overall a watchable if slightly predictable horror film and much better than it's current 3.6 rating on here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lots of pretty young people and 18 times the budget but none of the atmosphere, scariness, or originality of the superior 1980 film. The characters are all paper thin but that really doesn't matter in a movie like this, essentially a cheap slasher flick with music video gloss. Tom Welling makes for an attractive but wooden leading man. Maggie Grace looks pretty but contributes nothing except for her role in one of the stupidest endings to a movie ever. Seriously, you have to watch this turd just to see that ridiculousness. Selma Blair is largely wasted. The worst character is that of the black best friend comic relief. He's annoying as hell and he just won't die. The supporting cast pales in comparison to the great supporting cast of the original.It's a remake of a great movie so guess what...it sucks. This should surprise nobody. There was no attempt at originality or creativity in this film. But it's almost watchable in a superficial way. Almost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Avengers" with Uma Thurman a few years back is actually a reboot, so as the worst reboot made it leaves worst remake title to be filled by this utter dreck. Carpenter's 1980 original was economical, atmospheric and well-acted for the most part. The update evidently was made by gathering the cast beside a road and driving by with a camera hung out a car window until enough film was shot to destroy an hour and a half of viewers' time in a way almost criminally pointless. Miss Grace is awfully nice to look at but simply cannot act. The rest of the cast appear to be playing their characters as industrial soot - blank gray, irritatingly smudgy and immaterial to point of blowing away with a puff of wind. An actor named DeRay Davis was killed off and brought back to life simply because he's the only person on screen showing any vital signs. Early on, he hides in a freezer to escape (The Fog doesn't like frozen yogurt and Mexican TV dinners). And he lives! We're to believe that for hours he's a fishstick, thaws out awhile in a hospital bed and - boom! - it's comedy at the Apollo time. Beat that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog remake has pretty much the same plot as the original, with a few added plot-lines. Ghosts of men who were killed 100 years prior come to Antonio Bay to exact revenge, and they do so inside of the fog that surrounds the small town. All of the same characters are in this one, and they must battle the fog before it kills them all. A difference from the first film is that Elizabeth (Jamie Lee Curtis' character in the original) has weird flashes and dreams from the past. It's sort of explained in the end, but the movie doesn't do the best job telling us what it was all about."The Fog" (2005) fell flat when you sit it next to the 1980 version. There are a few good moments, like the kid racing home from the beach with the billowing fog chasing him. It's a really intense scene. But this remake tries to copy other scenes that were in the original, and fails miserably. The original film had a dark atmosphere which really made it creepy. I feel like this remake spent a lot of time on scenery details and special effects that did nothing for me. The 1980 movie was already done at a slow pace when compared to other films in the genre, but this remake moves it even slower which I didn't like. The writers of the remake also added some bits to the original tale that did not fully make sense to me, and the ending left me confused.The acting wasn't nearly as effective as the original either. Each character in the remake was done MUCH better by the actor who played them in the 1980 film. Jamie Lee Curtis was more effective than Maggie Grace, Tom Atkins did a better job than Tom Welling, and Adrienne Barbeau was better in the role of the DJ than Selma Blair was. I'll give this movie a five out of ten for it's efforts in remaking a classic film. There are some good moments with the use of the fog billowing into Antonio Bay and for trying to add to the story that John Carpenter/Debra Hill told, but like most remakes it just wasn't as good as the original.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I could have voted "0 out of 10" I would have. This was possibly one of the worst movies that I've ever seen. You see, normally when a movie is bad, I just stop watching, but with The Fog, the movie was actually so bad that I couldn't help but keep watching to see if the movie could actually get worse. Oh... did it get worse!?!There was no character development. I honestly didn't care whether everyone in the film died or not. I actually found myself rooting for the killer fog to swiftly exterminate everyone so that the movie could end.The plot was mostly absent. No explanations or reasons for anything. I think I actually set a personal record for the most incredulous looks and head shaking during a film.When the movie ended I awakened from a sort of mindless trance and realized that I had just wasted 100 minutes of my life. I want my 100 minutes back! Just thinking about all the things I could have done during the movie that would have been more fun makes me sick. I could have gouged my own eyes out with a cotton swab or jumped into a swimming pool filled with crazed, starving piranhas. Endless possibilities...Do yourself a favor and just skip this movie.</fullReview>

A bit more backstory about the vengeful sea wraiths, and a different ending. Apart from that, much is the same which, I felt, was problem number one.Problem number two is that it has absolutely no sense of conviction. There is a strong impression coming off the screen that nobody involved in it believes in it in the slightest. The original had a sense of style about it, a sense that it was doing something with some oomph: this has nothing.A shame. It's OK, but don't rush out to see it.</fullReview>

In fact, because of what we see of their backgrounds, I didn't have much respect for them either. This of course means that when they are faced with adversity, I'm not really concerned about what happens.Also, the ending (I won't reveal what happens), was not that great and made some, but not a lot of, sense.Anyhow, I think this was an improvement over the original movie, but only from 'bad' to 'ok'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film with virtually no expectations, and came out pleasantly surprised, it is by no stretch of the imagination a masterpiece, but it isn't as bad as many have said.When a mysterious fog descends on a small island of Calafornia, people start being mysteriously murdered and only a delinquent teenage girl with strange visions and her rebellious boyfriend can sop them before its too late.Most of this films faults come with its so clichéd you can almost predict everything that is going to happen, it has no originality or intelligence, relying on quick jumps to satisfy the audience, which fails. It also has occasional lapses of plot, like Nick stealing evidence from a murder scene and giving it to his girlfriend just makes no sense. Also, the appalling-named Spooner feels too much like the 'token black guy' and not actually a real character who contributes to the plot. And, it uses the one criminal cliché that the director deserves to be shot for, there are two girls dancing in there underwear and drinking beer, and guess what, they DIE! In this age of horror movies, that classically awful cliché should be punishable by DEATH! But, all that appears in the first half of the movie, and if you stick it out that long it improves quite significantly, although not enough to save the movie completely. The fog actually arrives, and it becomes quite tense, because anyone can die at any time. A lot do die, but you can't help but feel that Stevie should have died in the water instead of surviving, mainly because all the young, hot, main characters seem to survive, the old insignificant ones die. The flashback scenes are the best though, it may be because i have a fear of being burnt alive, but they were creepy, being shown in segments,but making sense by the end of the film. Despite the criticism of the end, I liked the twist, it was unexpected, beautiful,and fitted perfectly with the rest of the movie.Which brings me discretely onto acting, Tom Welling was terrible! He can pull of the goodie-goodie in Smalville, but the bad boy act just does not suit him. Maggie Grace was OK, she pulled off the part with believability and sensitivity, even if her emotions seem to change every second. Even so, just put your DVD on pause and watch her in silence, i guarantee you'll still be satisfied with what you see! Selma Blair was the best by a long way though, she was convincing as the slightly strange loner in a lighthouse, occasionally flirting with the weather guy. Everyone else seemed to be too unimportant to mention, but no one stood out as terrible.5/10- not great but could be worse.</fullReview>

I'm afraid I did not find any of these points throughout the film. The storyline is unique, however the film itself was too rushed, what I mean by that it the plot was found out by the public too early in the film for anyones liking. The fog effects were useless because you could see the mountains behind the fog when its supposed to be thick. You would have thought that someone would have noticed it and put it right! My over-all thought of this film is that it is worth watching with your girlfriend if she is scared easily but do not purchase it because you will want to take it back within a week.

		<fullReview>Just saw this movie for free, I borrowed it from a friend. I would have to say it's definitely not the worst movie I've ever seen, (for that, see "Mutant" with Wings Hauser) but it comes very close. I was hoping for something better than the John Carpenter original but was very disappointed.To sum up the bad things:Bad writing, directing, acting (with the possible exception of Tom Welling.. he was good), editing, plot, casting, continuity... hmmm, everything else was OK.The good things:Music. Graeme Revelle (one of the best underrated movie composers) does a good enough job but the tension never really builds. He most likely needed a bigger budget for music to do it justice.If you want an OK movie for your younger children to spook them a little, but in no way scare them in the slightest, this is for you. Otherwise your 100 minutes would be better spent elsewhere. Anywhere... (By the way, I saw the "Unrated" version hoping that would spark it up a bit, but the Disney Channel could show the full unrated version with maybe 4-5 words edited out).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Movie Overall and it's Somewhat Shocking Ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, this was just an alright movie for me. By saying that, I mean that I sat through it and didn't turn it off to watch something on TV. It's fine to rent if you want to find something new at the videostore, but keep in mind, it's not very good. It's not by any means The Ring, or The Sixth Sense . What this movie really lacks are those scary surprises that "good" horror movies are known for. The fog I suppose gave it a creepy atmosphere, but it's a movie, fog isn't scary on screen. To some viewers, the movie might be a little confusing, due to the poor character development. These are the same characters as those in the original, but they go nowhere with them. It's hard to relate to why we should care about who they are and what will soon be happening in the movie. The descendants of those that founded the town aren't quite laid out to be who they are, so anyone watching will unlikely know why there are ghosts coming out of the fog and will likely miss the whole point of the movie. This movie was only an hour and a half long, but it felt like it was over two. It was so slow paced that I found it kind of boring. The original wasn't all that great either, but this remake butchered what was of the original. Not to mention it's horrible ending;What the writers or director were thinking was beyond me. I think that they were maybe trying to make a shocking and unpredictable ending to make it a little different from it's original. It just left me confused to whether Maggie Grace's character was also a direct descendant only to be that of his dead wife, or just the dead wife's ghost. If it were the latter, it really made no sense at all. It was like they just decided to just "throw it in". Simply horrible. I'm just thankful that I didn't have to pay the money to see it in theaters. I waited for the video. Also, thanks to free rental, no money was shelled out of my pocket for this flop.Here's also a little irony for you, the ship's insignia is everywhere in this movie. This happens to be balancing scales which signify justice. It's justice that these ghosts seek in this flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This remake has lost the brooding, sinister quality of the original, but it's not all bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this age of scar-you-for-life Jap horror, the low-key suspense of the original was unlikely to fill you with dread, any more than the classic hook-on-the-car-door urban horror story. That wasn't the point - it was a classic ghost story about wrongdoing, and revenge, set in an isolated location that reinforced the sense of suspense and threat.This is a close retelling. Both films are set in an apparently remote coastal town, but the original imparts the sense of remoteness and isolation better. Thus, the first key premise is lost. Then, instead of populating the film with normal people, this one uses over-the-top stereotypes. The original's guilt-ridden priest, becomes insane and ranting, yet when offered the key piece of evidence that will unlock the cause of his torment, he dismisses the character offering it.The hitcher is replaced with an ex-girlfriend who has a psychic link to the ghosts. She's also the clumsiest mare ever to walk a plank - and what's with putting an open floor to the sea in someone's house anyway? God help you if this dozy trout is ever assigned to defend you in a murder trial!!! The first victims are no longer ordinary fishermen, instead they're hip, wisecracking, good-looking party animals who think that a fishing boat is a cool place to get down - and wasn't the clutch on that boat supposedly broken? But these over-the-top stereotypes could be forgiven if the script didn't make everyone else so GODDAMNED STUPID!!!! The fog is all around, and it's too thick to see ten feet, yet both sets of characters drive around these winding mountain roads at 90 miles an hour. Then not one, but both cars are conveniently involved in crashes.But what really peeves me, is how so many characters act as though nothing ever scares them. In an early incident, the little boy runs in to his aunt's house, so visibly terrified that he collapses to the floor leaving the door open behind him. His aunt casually closes the door, glances at the panic-struck boy, then at the luminous fog that has chased him at 200MPH, and in a completely disinterested voice calmly comments, "Oh my", before returning to her dishes.However, it wasn't all bad. Someone else commented - "How scary can fog be?" He clearly misses the point. It isn't the fog that was scary - it was what the fog hid and represented that was supposed to be scary. The ghosts were much better done this time, and of course, whereas Carpenter had to depend on spotlights and a smoke machine, thanks to CG effects the new fog could be made to wisp and slither wherever the director wanted it to go. This enabled him to show that the fog itself had become a manifestation of the evil that had been perpetrated all that time ago.Furthermore, apart from the fact that the deaths were far more creatively achieved in this version, the director explored the incident that created the ghosts and made them so angry. This was achieved via flashbacks and character conversations, and I felt that this was by far the most significant improvement over the original.All the elements are there, but ruined by utterly unbelievable character reactions, and some of the laziest script-writing ever to hit the screen. Fans of the original may enjoy it because it fleshes out the original story, but expect to shout at the screen as the characters act unbelievably time after time.The filmed was glammed up to appeal to the Pepsi generation, whereas it should have been left raw like the original. As it is, it totally fails to satisfy lovers of the original, or the new audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's offensive</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"How bad can this movie be?" I said whilst scrolling through the TV channels. I'd heard awful reviews of this so I decided to see how bad it was for myself. I can honestly say that it is one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my whole life. And boy, do I know bad movies.The plot: The quiet seaside town of Antonio bay is preparing to unveil the statue of the four people who founded the town. But things go horribly wrong when the ghosts of lepers murdered by the four men invade the town in a mysterious fog and begin killing everyone. I can't say much about the plot of this one as it IS a remake, but what I truly hated was that they ALTERED THE ENDING. I can't stress about how much I hate this after watching the remake of 'Planet of the apes', and the ending for this mess was rushed and nonsensical.The acting/characters: I have never seen such poor acting in a movie before. The casting director should be fired. Or are the actors just struggling to put up with such a lousy script? It's hard to tell. I'm actually surprised at how the actors got any work after this. The two leads have no chemistry whatsoever and all of the actors are practically expressionless. Seriously, kids in kindergarten could do better than this. As for the characters, they were one-dimensional and underdeveloped.The scares/special effects: There are no scares at all in this movie. It's all just soooo predictable! It's so obvious who's going to die from the characters stupid actions and the kills are unsatisfactory. The CGI is awful even for a Syfy movie, and that's saying something. Not to mention the ghosts themselves. Ugh! What made me so angry about the ghosts is that they were TRANSPARENT. I haven't seen transparent ghosts since 'Scooby Doo'! They made the movie even more unappealing and made it look cheaper furthermore.In conclusion, this movie is a complete waste of time and I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE. I completely regret watching this movie, as well as acknowledge its existence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An updating of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2005 remake of John Carpenter's "The Fog" (1980) stars Smallville's Tom Welling, as well as Maggie Grace &amp; Selma Blair.THE PLOT: A prosperous island community in Oregon is eerily beset upon by a mysterious fog -- a fog full of leprous ghosts who have come back from the dead to wreak vengeance on a town for the "sins of the fathers" over a century earlier.I don't understand the negative reviews of this film, not even a little bit. I'm not a John Carpenter aficionado but I did like his original version of "The Fog." It was slow and it wasn't gory, but it had great locations (Point Reyers/Bodega Bay, California) and a palpable eerie MOOD. This remake is an updating of the story 25 years later. Unless your an uber-fan of Adrienne Barbeau or Jamie Lee Curtis, this film is on par with the original and even superior in some ways. Here are some highlights:- The fog is arguably more menacing. In fact, the F/X in general are all-around superior, in particular the various leprous ghosts that appear in the fog. I love the visual where the fog forms a creepy face.- The story isn't fast-paced by any means, but it's not as slow as the original.- The eerie ambiance is still there even though lovers of the original say it isn't. There are a few jump scares, like the original, but neither film was meant to be uber-scary or gory, they're haunting mood pieces. - The scenic locations are at least as good as well. It was filmed on Bowen Island and Cowhichan Bay (Vancouver Island), British Columbia, both not far from Vancouver.- The picturesque and mysterious visuals are awe-inspiring.- The score is on a par with the original with the exception of the end-credits piece, which was absolutely stellar in Carpenter's film (a variation of this piece appears only once in the proper film).- The historic events of the leper ship colony are different than the original and are actually depicted in flashback, unlike the original where they're conveyed by word via an old journal. The changes in the backstory make for some spectacular visuals (e.g. the burning clipper ship, etc.)- The brief zombie scene is scarier and just all-around better done.- This is purely a matter of taste, but curvy Maggie Grace is superior to Adrienne Barbeau and Jamie Lee Curtis, at least as far as the filmmakers highlighting her curvy beauty (and I don't mean nudity 'cuz there isn't any).On the downside, Selma Blair is so over-the-top hip as the DJ it's actually annoying, but this is a minor criticism; she's fine otherwise. Speaking of excessive, some of the death scenes are so overdone they'll strike some people as more funny than creepy, e.g. Aunt Connie. BOTTOM LINE: If you're in the mood for a fast-paced slasher gorefest, you won't like this movie. If you're anal about Carpenter's original film, you won't like this remake. If, however, you're in the mood for a well-done, atmospheric, spooky and aesthetically pleasing mystery/horror picture, this 2005 version of "The Fog" will likely trip your trigger.The theatrical version runs 100 minutes and the unrated version 103 minutes (I saw the latter). GRADE: B+NOTE ABOUT THE ENDING (***SPOILERS***):Apparently, the ghost of Blake seeks Elizabeth because, despite being a descendant of David Williams, she's actually the reincarnation of Blake's wife and was one of her ancestor's victims, which explains her mysterious dreams about the Elizabeth Dane. Blake kisses Elizabeth and she transforms into a spirit and disappears as Nick watches helplessly. Obviously the writer of the script (Cooper Layne) wanted to add a love angle &amp; reunion to the leper-ghost story of the original film. I think it's an interesting touch.</fullReview>

This film; however, is beyond what even I can even describe as poor quality and misses the entertaining mark by a mile.You can see what they were trying to accomplish, and this story could have been engaging; however, it comes off more like something my 3 year old have come up with. Maybe if you are drunk... really really drunk, with idiot friends over, who are also drunk... and you made a game out of how poorly executed this movie is... maybe then, it could be entertaining.

		<fullReview>Often some great Horror gems receive low reviews. I feel, in the case of this film, it is severely underrated. It's a great film, has interesting characters and character development, is not entirely predictable, and there is some truth to this tale when it comes to West Coast history which will be apparent when viewing the film. In addition, the locations ARE all shot on the West Coast (Vancouver BC and Vancouver Island, BC) and the beaches, scenery, ocean in itself are beautiful to look at. The special effects are VERY well done, the suspense builds and you might have a jump or 5 during certain scenes, good music and sound effects, all in all, a fun horror/thriller with a great cast. The story/script is quite original. Why not give it a go?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't love the original. Nor am I one to claim that the only way a remake can be good is if it doesn't deviate from its source in the slightest. Heck, I'm not even going to insist that the atmospheric, deliberately paced, skillfully built up method of the '80 film is the only way to do this. What I am going to argue is that if you're going to copy as much of what you're going by as this does, you might want to try for a similar overall feel to it. You know, as opposed to just taking all that seemed to work that time around and stringing together scenes so as to allow for about all you can possibly muster of them, with the occasional change. Honestly, even that far, this doesn't completely lose. No, I think where this completely tanks, if you ignore the way some of the "creepy" situations come off supposedly commonplace(?) to the leads, the lazy and obvious delivering of exposition(was any attempt at all made to conceal it?) for quite a bit of it, the apparent lack of memorable lines as well as even a single genuinely impressive performance... no, where it ceases forward momentum is in one simple, unfortunate attribute: It ain't scary. Not particularly, if at all. It's not the PG-13; The Ring did masterful with the same rating. It's not directed with the proper understanding and care for horror. I haven't seen anything else by Wainwright, but I imagine Carpenter could take him to school on the genre. For now, us fans will have to re-watch classics, as the most terrifying thing in the current world of movies is how significantly awful the majority of the recent ones are. I recommend this mainly as MST3K fodder, and/or for those members the young crowd who are satisfied with music and slang that's in, as well as half-naked members of the other gender scampering around. 1/10</fullReview>

Although this movie wasn't that good , it deserves better than the 3.2 rating .It had a believable story line and the story was also well told.To a certain extend , it had great CG effects. (The fog) . It does had its scary moment as well.(My 5 year old nephew was petrified during certain scenes) The only problem was all the actors and actresses were pretty bad. They were stiff throughout the movie. Very very disappointed with Tom Welling (Superman), Maggie Grace (Lost) and Selma Blair (Hell boy). However, it should get at least a 5 star rating for effort!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film started out good, but then it went downhill. I don't see the reason why we should remake John Carpenter's flicks, they're good on their own. The only reason why I rate this 5/10 is because of the amazingly hot women and the scary parts. This film has several flaws in it though. If they had read the original script they could have made it much better. Of course if they had hired me as the writer...never mind. This is good for a rent for a so-cheesy-it's-good craving. I hated it when I first saw this, but after a while it grows on you. This is nothing like the original Fog. Hopefully, they'll make a better remake than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>UHG! Should have kept my VHS sealed - It'd be more valuable!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has the distinction of being the last major studio motion picture to be released on VHS tape. I found it for $1 in a bargain bin. It's in widescreen (letterbox) format, guess the effort to pan &amp; scan wasn't worth it. The effort to make this tripe wasn't worth it either. Besides, what's the point of remaking a story that has a fine original version already, which took the story as far as it could go.After the A-list actors said "no thanks", the producers ended up with B list TV actors, like Welling and Maggie Grace, to young-up the story and tap into their TV fame. Unfortunately, Welling is far from "super" and Grace seems "lost", she's really not an actress with range yet. And then the BORING exposition of the story is so tedious that we even have time to think how ludicrous it is that the revenge-seeking ghosts would appear 130 yrs later to murder those who had nothing to do with the original injustice, rather than just take their revenge on the original murderers. But, gee, it's all okay because they are just killing the drunken priest (he shouldn't be drinking) and the cold-hearted Mom (she should have welcomed her estranged daughter more heartily) and the Mayor (he's just an old white guy who must have done something bad for that reason alone).A piece of puke not deserving of the film it used, and all those involved in getting it to the screen ought to be banished to a town like where this was set. I wish I could reseal the package so it would have retained its unique value, and that's the only reason for anyone to ever buy a copy of this (on VHS).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's a good movie in here somewhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the 80s the trend was to make a franchise out of a hit horror movie. Thanks to our friends Mr. VHS and Mr. VCR the sequel stayed alive and well for many years. Eventually the genre died out a little because of the growing number of films in it's library. Now I'll admit to loving a lot of the sequels to films like 'Halloween,' 'Friday the 13th,' and 'Poltergeist,' but there's only so much you can do with some stories. The horror film became hot again in the mid-90s and soon after a new trend began: The remake. This word has sent a chill down the spines of horror fans everywhere because of it's meaning, which is a new version of a classic film that was fine to begin with. Surprisingly the remakes for 'Dawn of the Dead,' and 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre,' turned out quite good; better than they deserved to be. Can the same be said for the remake of the 1980 horror film 'The Fog?' I think not.Pros: Nice scenery and cinematography. A good score. The performances are OK, but the standout is Selma Blair as Stevie Wayne. The ghosts aren't as scary as those in the original, but still look good and vicious. The effects are quite good. Pace really picks up in the second half. It's nice that some things carried over from the original, but also that the makers of this film didn't copy it to a T. Plus they try to expand on the back story. This time the deaths are more supernatural and really effective.Cons: Some pacing issues in the first half. Plot's not clear due to an all-over-the-place script. Aside from Stevie Wayne it's hard to get attached to the rest of the characters. A weak ending. Feels a tad overlong. Has a few big plot holes, like why do the ghosts kill some people whose ancestors weren't even there during the events 100 years ago? I thought these guys were back for revenge.Final thoughts: The remakes that I mentioned above turned out good, but unfortunately I can't say the same for this remake of John Carpenter and Debra Hill's classic. There is quite a bit of good to be found in this one, but the flaws keep it from being much more than an OK time waster. Overall a nice try, but no cigar.My rating: 2.5/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fog-get "The Fog!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The new Columbia Pictures PG-13 rated remake of cult director John Carpenter's R-rated 1980 horror epic "The Fog" (* out of ****) proves that an $18 million dollar budget, an incoherent script, and the obvious use of CGI cannot make up for a shortage of nail-biting suspense and clammy-fisted chills. Although a PG-13 rating opens "The Fog" up to younger viewers, the drastic cutback in blood and gore as well as the intensity with which the filmmakers serve up their shocks dilutes the fear factor. Aside from fewer than five white-knuckled moments, this remake of "The Fog" neither makes your skin crawl nor raises the hair on the back of your neck like its imaginative predecessor. Worse, the CGI special effects look hopelessly phony. A death scene where razor-sharp glass shards impale a guy owes more to the "Final Destination" movies. Indeed, staging death scenes as elaborate gimmicks deprives the tragic act of its horror. You don't think about how gruesome such a death is so much as you marvel at the expertise with which the filmmakers orchestrated the live-action effects with the computer-generated ones. "Stigmata" director Rupert Wainwright and writer Cooper Layne of "The Core" have ramped up the evil power of the title antagonist. The 'new' fog can suck adults back through windows and turn seaweed into tentacles of terror! "The Fog" unfolds on the eve of the centennial celebration of the founding of the island town of Antonio Bay in Oregon. California provided the setting in Carpenter's original. As officials finalize the festivities, strange things begin to occur. A massive fog bank drifting against the wind lays siege to the scenic island. Not only does the fog shroud party-goers on a fishing boat in its homicidal haze, but this atmospheric phenomenon acts as a smoke screen for a spooky clipper ship manned by zombies. Sometimes, the undead show up as ghosts or as zombies. Inexplicably, ordinary objects defy gravity and become lethal weapons. Repeatedly, we learn that the treacherous Antonio Bay officials arranged a deal to sell land to a colony of wealthy lepers. These officials then cheated the lepers, plundered their valuables, torched their ship, and left them to drown in the murky waters of Antonio Bay. One hundred years later, the undead demand payback.Wainwright and Layne shun a shot-by-shot remake of the Carpenter classic, but their changes undermine the whole enterprise. Some alterations have legitimacy but others don't pass muster. In Carpenter's version, when the fog crept in, its supernatural force made a bank of pay telephones ring off the hook. Pay telephones are today an endangered species. Unfortunately, several changes appear arbitrary and done simply to differentiate the movies. The female lead discovers the murderous clergyman's diary in the remake rather than the priest in the original. Incredibly, Wainwright and Layne include a subplot with no closure that didn't appear in the first film. In their "Fog,' one of the principals is related to the dead lepers. Meanwhile, they add an entirely new character solely in the name of multiculturalism. African-American comic DeRay Davis of "Johnson Family Vacation" plays a Mike Epps wannabe and possesses none of the talent that legendary African-American comic Mantan Moreland brought to similar roles in 1940s' horror chillers. The new "Fog" packs its cast with pretty people who would look more comfortable modeling lingerie than mingling with zombies. Young Superman stars Tom Welling of "Smallville" fame and "Lost's" Maggie Grace headline a largely unknown cast. They appear to have been chosen more for their flawless skin than their acting chops. The only recognizable talent?Selma Blair of "Hellboy"--wears enough eye-liner to pass as a raccoon. Moreover, she appears far too young to have an elementary school-age son. Veteran character Rade Serbedzija of "Euro-Trip" is the only notable actor of any stature, but he languishes in a backstory role.Wainwright and Layne have tailored their "Fog" to audiences that can cope with an occasional jolt and prefer to see nothing that might be unpleasant. If you prefer lite-diet horror movies, the new remake of "The Fog" may be your cup of poison. As for hardcore gorehounds, fog-get "The Fog." This refers to the theatrical version.</fullReview>

It is obvious that they shot this just to capitalize on some TV personalities that they thought would get the kiddies to the theater.Maybe one day Tom Welling (Cheaper by the Dozen ), Maggie Grace (Lost), or Selma Blair (Hellboy) might make a movie worth watching, but I doubt it.

		<fullReview>Pointless redo of John Carpenter's 1980 movie. Antonia Bay from the first one is turned into Antonia Island (???) off the coast of Oregon. Fishing captain Nick Castle (Tom Welling--and yes I got the "Halloween" reference) is dealing with ex girlfriend Elizabeth (Maggie Grace) who has just returned to town and a woman he's been seeing--Stevie Wayne (Selma Blair). Also the town is going to have a ceremony to commemorate the four founding fathers. SPOILER ALERT!!! What they don't know is that the founding fathers were actually murderers and the ghosts of the victims are returning in the fog to take revenge. END SPOILER!!!!Yawn. The plot has been changed a little but not much. The acting here is actually pretty bad compared to the original. The original had Jamie Lee Curtis, Janet Leigh, Adrienne Barbeau (who was actually very good) and Hal Holbrook. This redo is just full of young actors who look good--it doesn't seem to matter that they can't act. Welling is just horrible (he takes off his shirt a few times to show his muscular chest hoping we'll ignore his considerable acting incompetence) and Grace seems lost. Only Blair tries to give out a good performance. Also the original had beautiful wide-screen photography, a creepy score and Carpenter's nice directorial touches. They're all missing here.Even if you don't compare it to the original this still is bad. It's VERY slow-moving (I dozed off briefly in the middle), with boring dialogue, characters and situations. The was next to no gore (gotta get that all important PG-13 rating) and, basically, this just isn't scary. It all leads to a REALLY stupid ending that had me staring at the TV in disbelief.It's easy to see why this bombed so badly in 2005. Check out Carpenter's original--it's so much better than this stupid redo. A 1 all the way.</fullReview>

What in the hell happened here? Tom Welling and company suck. I like Welling in Smallville, and Cheaper by the Dozen, but this does not work out for him. Don't watch, even the Unrated cut, it's even worse. Watch something useful like Halloween or Batman Begins.

		<fullReview>The original thriller from John Carpenter was considered a minor disappointment coming after the unexpected mega-success of his Halloween, but over time managed to carve out a niche for itself as a classy modern-day ghost story. The remake, yet another in a seemingly endless cavalcade, fails to improve on any of the original's shortcomings and emerges as an underwhelming failure. On a small coastal town's 100th anniversary, vengeful spirits from a shipwreck arise to wreak havoc on the descendants of those who conspired to murder them and steal their fortune. The remake keeps the same basic premise as the original, but jettisons all of the atmosphere, character and quirkiness of the original film. Familiar faces were littered among the original cast, but the remake features no one in particular. Leads Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are very photogenic. Unfortunately, Grace spends much of the film reading her lines in a flat affect and resembling a deer caught in the headlights. Welling may not have been bad had someone bothered to write him a role. As it stands, he gets to take his shirt off once and spend the majority of the film yelling thankless lines like "Let's get out of here" and "Run." Selma Blair, replacing the coolly sexy Adrienne Barbeau, is laughably miscast as a sultry DJ. Can anyone honestly listen to her voice and believe any radio station would hire her? The remake slightly beefs up the back story of the ghosts to no avail and contains a completely incomprehensible and pointless conclusion, which is not surprising from a screenplay that still appears to have been in the development stage. A total mess ? stick with the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why? Oh God, why...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This review is causing me problems. I feel that every film should be judged on its own merits (or lack thereof), yet it is impossible in this case NOT to reference John Carpenter's original. Therefore, let me set the scene..."A film called 'The Fog' you say? What's it about? Vengeful spirits? Well I do like a good horror film and the concept of figures appearing out of the fog is quite freaky...this should provide a few scares...lets put it on and let the slaughter begin..."Characters - awful. Every one of them. Selma Blair is particularly offensive (and her quirky charm usually brings a certain something to proceedings) as the two dimensional, indestructible (see the car crash) radio DJ/mother who sees nothing wrong with wandering around in the tiniest bikini bottoms in front of her son. Tom Welling is unconvincing as, well, anything and lets not start on the bland Ms. Grace... Apart from these, everyone else was purely a contrivance to move the 'story' along. Enough said...Story - if I'm reviewing this on its own merit, then the story is merely unoriginal, drawing on and plagiarising many other standard horror conventions. As for the pace, if its going to take the first hour plus for something to happen, at least use that time to develop the plot, create some interest, build the characters, make us give a crap...Special Effects - I wouldn't have thought that with the technological advances of recent years that a few ghostly special effects would have been particularly difficult. Therefore, it says a lot when the fog itself looks fake, let alone the more complex rotting flesh, wounds, ghost ships etc.Now for my major complaint. It wasn't scary. Not in a million years should this be described as a horror film. Every 'scare' was predictable, obvious, gimmicky and quite frankly, an insult. Superfluous characters killed off with 1970s-style methods - all appalling.I had planned on saying much, much more but no matter how objective I try to stay, I keep getting angry that I spent any time at all watching this. There is nothing new in this review, but I feel that people must be warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They killed the original, they should be taken by their freaking Fog.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was happy when i heard that a new "scary movie" was coming out, so I went to the theater and got myself a ticket for 'The Fog', I regretted it, oh boy did I ever. It would've just been a plain old boring movie (which wouldn't have been that terrible) hadn't it been for that ending, yes the ending that didn't make any sense at all and had nothing to do with the original.Sure the actors are nice looking and you know they all tried to make this movie scary but thats it, they tried, my best guess is, they got distracted by a pretty bird outside while writing this movie and just said, this BS makes enough sense to me lets go outside to see this pretty bird. Bad bird, very bad bird! Bad movie, very bad movie.The best advice that I can give you is see the original, the special effects are amazing for the 70's the acting more believable, you care more for the characters and it's creepier. I bought the original without knowing if it was any good, well it is, it really is.So to sum up: "wannabe remake" = bad. Original 70's movie = kick-ass</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This updating of the John Carpenter movie really is awful. Although it roughly follows the plot of the original, it doesn't work as a horror film at all. First and foremost...IT'S NOT SCARY! NOT ONCE! It doesn't even build up tension effectively. The only time I covered my eyes with my hands was whilst I was weeping over the money I'd wasted renting this stinker. The ghosts themselves aren't spooky in the least. I was constantly distracted by the ghost in the jaunty hat who appeared in the background in several scenes, mainly as something about it made me think of Jack White from the White Stripes, and, since Selma Blair's song selection (in her role in the film as a radio DJ) seemed tailor made for a teen-friendly soundtrack album, I kept hoping we might be treated to a musical interlude (perhaps during the flashback) in which it broke into a performance of Seven Nation Army. I could go on, but in order to write about this movie, I have to think back to watching it, and I really, really want to erase it from my memory. So to sum up: AVOID!</fullReview>

Hopefully life may make something of him yet as an actor. But I'm not holding my breath.Ly forgettable. Hence, the film-title is apt for this purpose.There was absolutely not one thing this film did for me other than make me realise I really should have paid more attention to the 'From the makers of 'Halloween'' line on the bottom of the cover.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of John Carpenter's 'The Fog' and based very loosely on James Herbert's novel of the same name. Unfortunately this movie has very little in common with either of the aforementioned Horrors, it simply isn't scary enough to be called a horror movie at all. Some horror films manage to pull this off by having great characters and a great atmosphere, making them very compelling and creepy, but the fog doesn't have these redeeming features either.What this film does have is some great visual effects and an entertaining storyline (yes its flawed and contrived) but it does provide light entertainment.It's not a total waste of time, but it's definitely not worth going out of the way for. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I give 5 out of ten in stead of 1 since a horror movie can always be fun to watch. This movie sure used some better special effects, and had the nice scenery that could make it cinematographically attractive. But all the aspects what made the 1980 version so excellent were missing here. Also the end, of Elizabeth going up in smoke in the past was quite inappropriate. What made the original so good, is just like what made Halloween 1978 stand out. Good music, good acting, good build-up of tension, in other words, a good horror atmosphere all the way up to the climax - this one was totally pointless. Why always make a new version when the only new thing added is young faces? The 1980 version would still be appreciated now, and does not need polishing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the lamest horror movies ever. The only time i jumped was at the start when the guy is pulled into the water by an unknown thing lurking in the sea, and even then i knew it was coming and it was more the noise than the actual action.The plot was rather dodgy too; girl comes back, people are lamely murdered on a boat while they're having sex in the shower, blah blah bodies are found, more people are lamely murdered, Elizabeth makes out with a lip-less skeleton ( yea that creeped me out the most, she was kissing a hundred year old spirit with no lips and a mouth that was like half the size of her entire head ) the end.i thought the movie was more funny than scary, you'd think after the black guy said i hid in the freezer because it couldn't get me in there they'd work it out and hide themselves in a fridge or freezer rather than running around out in the fog letting themselves get picked off. Also stupid was that most of the town was attacked by the green fog and then the radio announcer gets on air the next day and gives her little thought. Also her son was random. Wasn't Nick cheating on Elizabeth with her? So who owned the kid? What happened to that? Oh, look this other girl's back, well i'll just go back to her. ?? Anyway i wasted money renting this movie and i advise you don't do the same, oh unless of course you like watching lame horror movies, in which cause go right ahead and be my guest.</fullReview>

Because that is what its exactly like. If I were John Carpenter, I would sue the SOB who ruined his movie. Why cant they just leave great movies alone. Why do they always have to ruin the movies, that we grew up with? They need to look at this movie, and Halloween, and What Lies Beneath, and see what works, and then USE IT IN THEIR MOVIES.

		<fullReview>I have just watched the new version of The Fog.Oh my but this is just no good at all. The Fog for a lot of horror fans of differing ages is seen as a classic and I was lucky enough to see it when it was first released in the UK.Even better when I came out of the cinema I found that there was a thick fog to go home in. Spooky ehBut this one is just a pale imitation. Other than the mayor being forced along by Blake the original with its tiny budget is just so very much better.No wonder it seemed to come and go at cinemas here in the UK.As for the music. I know that style moves on but it could have done with picking up some of JC great mood music as well as the odd mix of music that was chosen because of budget limitations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I just finished watching The Fog. It stars Tom Welling (Clark Kent, Smallville) who is just great in this movie. It was a little strange to watch him not save the day, but he was fun to watch none the less. The story is about a little island off the east coast that once was just a trading post and over the years since 1871 became an actual town with the four founding fathers' families never leaving. In 1870 a ship of lepers from a near by trading post purchase half the island so they can live peacefully. The forefathers decide at the last minute that they do not want to jeopardize their existing colony and take the payment for the land and whatever else they can grab off the ship and burn it leaving the lepers to die. Can you guess where this is going? Yeah. The lepers come back to exact revenge 100 years later on the current generations of the founding fathers. Even though this same type of story has been done like 50 times, I felt is started out to be a pretty good movie. It was very creepy and had me worried I might actually jump. I thought the story started off well enough, revenge is always a good story and then have someone exact it on a group of people who don't really deserve it, now you have a horror flick. It was all going well for me until the end. The girl, Elizabeth, who figures the story out and is also Tom Welling's girlfriend and bares a striking resemblance to the captain's wife, decides to start making out with the ghost captain. He then proceeds to take the rest of his crew and leave - only after Elizabeth has been turned into a ghost and comes with him. The ending sucked. By all rights Tom Welling's character should have been killed. He was family of one of the forefathers...And it is not like taking his girlfriend was going to do too much to him emotionally since he was cheating on her while she was in New York for the last six months. The story just had major inconsistencies - and we all know I cannot stand that.It has been said that after a screening of this movie for a test audience that John Carpenter (director of the original) decided to add the ghosts in because the people wanted to see the "evil." I guess they were pretty good effects for an afterthought. They were the only thing worth watching this movie for, unless you are interested in seeing Tom Welling without his shirt. I know I am always up for that!! All in all I hated this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILERS* For whatever reason, there is going to be a celebration on Antonio Island, Oregon, and young Elizabeth (Maggie Grace, who did her best with what she got) is back in town for the fun.She reunites with boyfriend Nick (Tom Welling, who doesn't look the part of a young and rugged fisherman - and has the total of 3 facial expressions) just as a deadly (and heavily CGI-looking) Fog rolls in, wanting to party, too.And rest assured, it throws KILLER parties! This movie has nice ideas (the comeuppance in the ways of dying is one, and contrary to someone else, I think the Elizabeth/Blake plot was nicely developed, the idea of 'The Sins Of The Father' is another) but that doesn't avoid the pitfalls - like the ATROCIOUS character of Spooner (DeRay Davis - what, Cuba Gooding Jr. wasn't available for yet another bad movie?), the ridiculous scene on the Seagrass (pre-murders), or the fact that the subplot of Spooner being accused of 3 murders is inexplicably dropped.By the way, why were Tom, Mandi, Jessica, Dan and Aunt Connie (which I can guess is NOT a relative of Stevie's) killed if the ghosts in the Fog just wanted revenge on the descendants of the people who killed them? It is NEVER told that they are related to the families (Tom being Nick's cousin does not count-too far a relation), it makes NO SENSE. And WHY OH WHY didn't Blake kill Stevie Wayne (Selma Blair at her worst) when he had the choice? She was a descendant of Wayne, after all... and they killed 2 Castle (Nick's father and uncle): one wasn't enough? I also didn't like Stevie's leaving the lighthouse, nor did I like Dan's death (he was my favorite character, and I liked him in the original, too).So, in conclusion, The Fog (2005) blows chunks.The Fog (2005): 2/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paper thin acting, loose plot, and abysmal script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason i watched the fog was because a friend of mine told me it was the worst movie he had ever seen. I thought i might have a fun time just watching it for the sake of seeing something bad and laughing at it. Sadly, not once did i laugh.Put bluntly, the entire plot revolves around two people in love, one person who does a radio show, some annoying little kid who has no impact on the plot AT ALL, and a drunk priest. For the majority of the movie, an entire town ignores the fact that a boatload of teenagers was killed with no clues left behind, a mysterious fog rolls in every night, and ghosts write graffiti on gravestones.With the exception of a pathetic and pointless love scene in a shower, and the dead teens on the boat, almost nothing even remotely stimulating occurs until the final twenty or so minutes.The movie tries to be frightening by throwing in some "attempted" gore, which won't scare anyone more than 6 years old. There were some perfect opportunities for a really good death scene, but these were just ignored, and no characters passing did anything but relieve me of the pain of hearing their terrible dialogue.ex: The aunt is doing the dishes. A hand reaches out from the water in the sink and touches her. She turns into a skeleton. What does this have to do with fog? The characters are all dull and show no development. The actors only serve to worsen this problem. Some characters are so thick, they literally walk to deaths.In one scene, the town bum (who somehow can afford a metal detector) somehow detects a rope (how much metal is in rope?) on the beach at night, grabs the rope and starts pulling it up. It goes tight, so he follows it into the water (not realizing there is a massive, poorly done CGI fog approaching him). Eventually he walks into the sea, following the rope until neck deep in water. There he drowns.Sadly, this is not the dumbest scene in the movie. Nor is the completely set table in the middle of the beach (once again, no tie in to the already crumbling plot). That title is reserved for the ending, which does not solve anything. It is the biggest anti-climax I have ever witnessed.If you are in the mood for something so incredibly predictable and slow, that you are better off hitting the stop button one third through and making up your own ending (wich WILL be better than this film's), then go ahead and watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lacked a specific detail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original "The Fog" was excellent. This remake lacked a very distinct detail that helped make the original release a true classic hit.The Fog Horn.Throughout the classic release, the musical score and Fog Horn sounded, making it a character of the movie itself. The remake lacked this very simple yet powerful detail.There were other details that lacked in the final release of the remake that should have been included, and the departures from the original movie is probably the reason it lacked the same punch as the original. If any lesson can be learned, a remake should stay close to the original which is what makes a great remake. When there is too much departure for whatever reason, a classical hit can be tarnished.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasted Effort On Updating A Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fairly excited to see this remake, I wanted to see where the filmmakers would go with it, because the original film was so good. Well, I went to see this with some friends, and we found it to be extremely unexciting and uninspiring. This updated version features basically the same plot, this time though it's set in Antonio Bay, Oregon, rather than Antonio Bay, California. There is an eerie thick fog that begins rolling into town on the 100th anniversary of the town's founding, and, as the priest said, the ghosts of mariners who want revenge come ravaging through the town, picking off the descendants of the town's founding fathers who were responsible for their horrible deaths.Two major television stars, Tom Welling ("Smallville") and Maggie Grace ("Lost) star as our main leads, and give lackluster performances. Welling plays the clichéd "ex-boyfriend" and Grace is the innocent girl (who also likes to walk around in her underwear) who can see all of the horrible things that are happening. On rare occasions, some horror movies can work with so many clichés, but this one didn't at all. Selma Blair is the best performer of the whole film (playing the radio host Stevie), she alone is the best in the movie. Too bad she was involved with this, but I guess she improved it slightly. The fog this time around is obviously CGI, so it's everywhere, slithering under doors, through car vents, etc. I think real fog would've been much better, but with the technology, I expected CGI. The kills in this movie weren't scary at all when they tried to be, in fact they were just boring and unoriginal, example being the scene on the boat with the guy and those two promiscuous girls. Not once was I slightly spooked at all, I was just bored. And when the ending came around, I was so confused I wanted to yell at the screen. The film's conclusion was abrupt, semi-confusing, and just completely unneeded. The credits rolled, and I didn't feel like that had been the end of the movie at all. It just didn't fit.Unfortunately, the entire film just "didn't fit". It was boring, unoriginal, and was just an all around unfaithful and uninspired remake. This is the kind of horror movie you go see on Halloween with some friends without any intentions of seeing a good movie, because this one really wasn't. Some CGI fog and a lackluster ending don't make a good movie. A failed effort that could have been halfway decent. 3/10.</fullReview>

The acting is o.k., and some of the fx aren't all that, but the storyline is similar enough to the first where it wasn't completely bastardized, and the ending wasn't cheery and unexpected, which was welcome. I think a lot of horror fans are weary of remakes of classics, and some of them do not get their day in court, so to speak. Don't get me wrong, a shot by shot remake of "Psycho" is retarded, and the new "Amityville" sucked. There are plenty of examples to throw to the fire, but I felt that this remake was watchable, and not a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blithering Idiots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Various Minor Spoilers*** And by blithering idiots I specifically would like to point to the "writer" (some hack named Cooper Layne), and the director, a Mr. Rupert Wainwright. Producing this sort of garbage is bad enough. Doing so when you have a vastly superior earlier version on which to draw is pathetic. Did they watch the earlier movie? Were they simply too stupid to understand why it actually succeeded? Apparently so. Or so arrogant at the amazing successes of their own sad little careers that they thought they could do "better" by dumbing the movie down to sub-moron level and throwing in a few pretty faces.So where to begin...Let's see, first of all of course, it would appear Mr. Layne was unable to grasp the very simple connection between the fog, and the creepy/mysterious events of the first movie. Thus we get randomly killed dead dogs with no fog around, soggy footprints with no fog around, even the pickup truck's broken windows with no fog around. The fog is in fact irrelevant, because this hack is writing yet another braindead "ghost" story without any grounding in the original premise. We even get the sad stereotypical joke of a stock black jive-talking side kick popping up to do nothing but be the stock black jive-talking side kick.Secondly of course neither the writer nor director, nor apparently burnt out old John Carpenter himself (who apparently took a wad of cash to lend his name as "producer") have an ounce of confidence in the very thing that made the first one work -- the cold blooded ice cold revenge of a pack of undead sea zombies. Proceeded by a freezing fog, hacking people up with a variety of pirate-esquire hooks and blades. So no, our new modern masters of horror decide that the completely standard and boring CGI pseudo-ghosts would be far scarier. And rather than emerging out of the fog to brutally maul people, that instead we will accumulate the standard array of stupid "let's be neat" death scenes, with genteel ghosts apparently kung-fuing people through windows, setting them on fire, throwing knives at them, killing them with shards of glass, and magically killing people through the disposal. As I've mentioned they simply did not get it. No consistency, no pattern, no tension, creepiness, fear, nothing remotely special about these ghost/zombies at all. Just another tired excuse for hack writers to try to outcool themselves with a bunch of pointless deaths. They even manage to completely write out the entire cold blooded and semi-logical motive for the zombies from the first film -- wanting to get back what was stolen from them and kill the descendants of the thieves. But the all wise dubious duo here thinks it has a better idea -- more or less write the priest out of the story, and have the zombies want...er...actually that remains pretty unclear.Finally of course the classic sign of somebody who just should not be writing/directing horror movies -- the moronic urge to show everything. Repeat after me uberhacks -- the unseen is scarier than the seen. Repeat it 20 times before bed every night. 20 times in the shower every morning. Whatever it takes until it gets through your thick heads. Our duo of doom here so completely misunderstands the concept they ever dip so low as to show a cheesy "ghostly" hook banging on the doors to produce the formerly creepy knocking effect. And then pull out all the stops and erase any lingering chance of a scary movie with an utterly ridiculous "climax" -- going from the incredibly creepy image of a group of fog shrouded shapes with glowing eyes waiting to embrace the priest in the first movie to an extended scene of a cheesy pseudo-ghost throwing people around with his staff.So given all the idiocy, how exactly did this movie avoid a "1" for me? Three things actually: first of all, I always feel compelled to leave room for the "Skeleton Man"s of the world in the sub-basement. Secondly, the cinematographer here actually showed a sporadic touch. Sporadic, but occasionally a professional shot that would have been worthy of a less vomitous effort. And finally, and perhaps most significantly, the three leads, Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair, actually give it the old college try here and probably do about as much as they can with this material. Which ain't much of course. And with Welling woefully miscast because he is pretty. But they try. Blair in particular appears to have actually watched the first movie as she tries to channel her inner Adrienne Barbeau. And so they take a complete disaster, and while not saving it from being a complete disaster, at least, unlike the writer/director here, prove that they deserve to get another job in the business at some point.</fullReview>

It had its moments but never had any scenes that really stood out and made you think. I mean, what was the deal with the black dude SPOONER and those white chicks dancing on the boat? That was not very interesting. Spooner is ICE CUBE minus the fat appearance. All in all, the FOG delivered very few goods. I would suggest watching this movie if you are interested in Leprosy because all the ghosts in THE FOG seem to have this dreaded disease. The worst part about this movie was that annoying lady in the light house. She could not compare to John's wife from the Original movie. The sad thing is, I bought this DVD in Sacramento.

		<fullReview>The small island of Antonio Bay becomes consumed by a marauding smoke machine which threatens bore everyone into an early grave. Seriously folks, if I had lived on that island I would have rang the party supplier and reported a defective smoke machine and demanded a credit on my next karaoke hire.The film has some sort of back-story involving the burning of a ship and some crazy pirates that appear to be suffering from leprosy. Don't be surprised if you can't follow the flashbacks because it seems the director felt it would involve too much common sense to put them into any sort of logical order. Don't worry though, the blonde chick from Lost will occasionally state the bleeding obvious, thus giving you a nice recap of what the **** is going on.It seems the only reason this pile of steaming crud managed to obtain a theatrical release was because blondie and Superman agreed to get their kit off and have a bit of rumpy pumpy fun in the shower.There's no real scare factor to the movie - unless passive smoking happens to be a grave fear of yours. Occasionally Selma Blair will walk around in her underwear attempting to act cool and trendy - but really she's fooling no-one.The special effects are worth a special mention because - let's face it - it looked like someone knocked this movie up on their iMac.Dragging on and using tired fog-gags every five minutes will leave you asking for the final 67 minutes of this movie - 'Why didn't blondie get her norks out twice?'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cheap thrills and god awful "acting" abound. John Carpenter's 1980 outing was the real deal. I remember being scared back then. This is completely laughable. An utter snoozefest. You could not pay me to watch it again. Irritatingly poor. Annoying to the point of anger. People opening doors they shouldn't, going outside at night alone, telephones going dead. All the clichés are here. Plain stupid. Someone make Rupert Wainwright go away. Someday, I may even finish watching it, but not today. Tomorrow's not looking good either. How about never? That works.To IMDb, stop making people write so much that no one bothers to read it. There is value to short and to the point reviews. They don't ALL need to drone on and on. The above wasn't long enough I had to add this. hmph.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Fog (1980) is a fun, scary film that isn't perfect but is certainly enjoyable. This made me optimistic for the 2005 remake, because there was a golden opportunity to fix flaws and take advantage of newer special effects. Unfortunately, the remake fails on both accounts. Worse, not only did the filmmakers waste the chance to improve upon the original, but they forgot what was frightening about it in the first place. The claustrophobic feeling of being trapped by the fog which was so thrilling in John Carpenter's movie is discarded entirely in favor of CGI ghosts and expositional flashbacks which regularly show up to deflate any potential tension. The fog itself has been animated to seem more alive, yet I found myself missing the fog machine with a green light behind it. All in all, I can find absolutely nothing to recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie which fails at almost everything, except being bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(warning, this review contains massive spoilers) This movie is simply downright bad, the reason is not simple though, as there are multiple factors all contributing to each dragging down this title down into the sea where it should have remained.First off all, the acting is easily the best part of the movie, although the characters don't seem to have simple basic intelligence, the lines delivered and the timing is good, which makes this part of the movie alright.The plot is *very* contrived, it's a deliberate attempt by the director to be mysterious and pardon my pun, quite foggy on the subject. However, said fog also opens up a whole batch of plot holes as well, such as .. why can't the fog enter certain areas when it can manifest itself and basically thrash everything in the way of it? So, with this in mind, it's hard to enjoy the movie because you're constantly reminded that what happens is completely illogical and really has no other use than to advance or augment the plot in some way. The ending, although a bit foreseeable (once you've seen one "ghost vengeance" movie, you've seen them all) still ends in a rather idiotic way with the heroine scampering off with the main baddie and leaving everybody else thinking "seriously.. .. WHAT THE HELL?" There's no logic that can save this, no matter how much one tries to fanwank it, this story just simply sucks and so does this movie. 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's classic chiller, made in 1979 and released in 1980, gets the remake treatment from Hollywood and is nothing short of disastrous. I could explain this film's updated plot but whats the point? Its almost the same as the original, except there are no scares, no chills - nothing! The acting is woeful.Woeful? No, the acting in this film is full of planks masquerading as previous characters from a much better storyline. I got an impression halfway through watching it, that none of the cast were determined to improve upon the performances in Carpenter's flick, which half kills whatever potential the producers' thought this film had.Selma Blair's Stevie Wayne D.J. makes Adrienne Barbeau's portrayal look Oscar worthy. She is bored in this remake and sleepwalks through her role. Tom Welling as Nick Castle looks just like any other Hollywood Hero in waiting - without the charisma or likable charm that Tom Atkins gave in the original. Atkins could act Welling out the door in his sleep.The heroine, Elizabeth, is portrayed by the pretty Maggie Grace. Her acting in this film is pretty dire. The only scene worth watching is her have sex with Welling in the shower and even thats rubbish. We also find out that her character is a reincarnation from the leper colony who were betrayed by the founding fathers of Antonio Bay. This never happened to Jamie Lee Curtis.Who cares? Finally, as the acting goes, Adrian Hough is given very little to do as Father Malone. So memorable a performance of quiet dignity by Hal Holbrook in Carpenter's film, that you don't really care for Hough's version, in fact he does nothing but drink from a bottle, slosh his words and swishes his Bryan Ferry hairdo about in fits of frustration.So when he gets sliced and diced i could not have cared less. When Holbrook was killed right at the end of the original, i was shocked and a little saddened. I thought the lepers would spare him.The 'Fog' in this film is a computer generated green storm cloud about fifty feet high. When i watched this version's attack on the Seagrass i thought it was lame and poorly carried out, unlike the original which was both scary and gut wrenching when those fishermen are hooked and knifed to the deck you hear blood dripping, you hear guts being ripped open, but you don't see it.That was Carpenter's skill as a film director at the top of his game. Also, Carpenter did his own music for his flick. He and Dan Wyman made a soundtrack of 'Electronic Realization' This was to give The Fog itself a sound. Just like John Williams did with the shark in Jaws. In this remake they settle for a half-baked 'roaring' soundtrack which we have all heard before in our yawns.Atmosphere and Mystery were what John Carpenter achieved with The Fog. It is one of my personal favourites. Like a lot of Movie Fans on the IMDb i was very disappointed that Hollywood had to churn out a remake of The Fog. In director Rupert Wainwright's hands this remake falls flat from the start, its proved to be what everyone knew it would be: utterly pointless.The remake of the Fog does not even merit credibility as a Televised feature film its that bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Keep it Simple Stupid is my message to the filmmakers.This film doesn't work. Sure, it pieces together at the end and makes sense, but it's one of those films with too many scenes that achieve nothing but bloat.Why add another death? We know the ghosts are coming to take out whoever gets in their path, but the message is clear after a few of those. Cut the bulk of the uninventive scenes out -- like cars (yes, plural!) not starting when a zombie is on your tail. Focus on making the good ones better by drawing them out a bit, injecting some suspense and asking yourself, "Is this scary?" If it's not, then modify it until it is.So after wading through a hundred more scenes of watching zombies and fog kill people, the film finally draws to a close and we get to learn what is going on. Personally, I think this film would have been more effective had we been given the background at the beginning of the film. Instead, we're left wondering what the hell is going on right until the end by which point we no longer care.A script with more err ... script would have helped made the point of the film clearer too. We shouldn't have to scratch our heads all the time. I'm not advocating dumbing it down, just telling the story more effectively by adding a few realistic conversations -- then it's a win-win situation: by watching the characters communicate, we care for them more, and we follow the story better.The pacing was another issue. There weren't enough slow/quiet scenes, so like most modern horror, it felt rushed, which is the director's fault. If you want something to be scary, a buildup can work wonders to frighten someone -- see What Lies Beneath (Zemeckis knows Hitchcock had it right).The trouble with this film, like so many others, is that the budgets are too big. Directors make the mistake of putting special effects everywhere they can, instead of where they're needed. Look at some of the 70s horror classics and learn: Keep it Simple (Stupid!) and refrain from making the objective to cram as much crap down our throats as possible, or face the consequence: sensory overload and glazed eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all I was in no way impressed by this movie. The acting wasn't all that, a few special effects were there just to make the movie longer (some were really nice though) and the story . . . well first of all it can't really be called a horror movie . . . If this movie is a horror movie so are The pirates of the Caribbean and no one is calling that horror. If it was a movie called The Ghosts of the past (or something like it,I'm not referring to any actual movie) classified as a fantasy, drama, mystery this movie would have been just fine, not great, but you know, another average movie with a couple of really good moments and a couple of really bad ones. I do agree that the second part of the move is better and that it can in no way compare to the original from 1980. I still remember watching that as a kid (I wasn't supposed to, so I would have nightmares) being all scared and spooked. In the new Fog some of the scenes that were supposed to be scary weren't scary but beautiful - and it's hard to be afraid of something beautiful. There are huge holes in the plot and some of the things that happen just don't make sense but oh well, many movies have that it's really not such a big deal. I think the main reason people hated this movie is that most of them have seen the original and can't help but compare the two, and the second reason is that it was supposed to be scary but it wasn't. With a different type of advertising people would know what to expect.Still if we for pretend, just for a second, that this movie was indeed advertised to me a fantasy drama mystery movie, without the horror part then it deserves a solid 6 :) I think you should watch it, just remember it's not a horror movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Basically, I sat in a comfy chair, with my eyes just watching the screen, and not knowing what was going on. Sitting there,with my mouth drooping open and shoving popcorn into it, it was probably the most entertaining thing my friends saw,while the movie was running. I can't really recall anything, but I'm sure that they revealed certain history about "the fog" at the beginning of the movie, completely making it predictable. It would have helped to leave the history about the fog till last, making the audience actually want to pay attention and not know what will happen. Nevertheless, the FX were excellent. The suspense that some of the film showed was well done.But by the time the film had finished, the big question: "What was that about??" It was as if we had forgotten about the whole history behind the fog, completely erasing the whole plot of the story from our minds and watching a blank movie without a plot.</fullReview>

If you had been told the biggest secret, the story will be less attractive.However, if the audience don't know that at all, they would create a number of possibilities on what it was written in the notebook. At least, they could lead to different ending. That would turn them on too.If the script goes wrong, even a master would never make it better. That's my point.

		<shortDescription>The Fog 2005 "REMAKE" Is the Worst film ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I work as a assistant manager at a theater and I remember the time this film was showing. A lot of people bought tickets for it thinking since John Carpenters, "The Fog" (1980's version) was a good horror flick that this one would be even better... Not true, Many many people walked out of the theaters and complained some people wanted a refund, most just wanted to trade in their tickets to see something else at the box office. I remember one lady quoted "Hollwood doesn't care about what is good or not good in considering making good movies these days, it's all about money-making." The movie didn't sell to well after the 2nd day of showing in fact the projectionists had to tear down the film after we had it in a week because it was making low sales as opposed to the other films we were showing. By all means, please do not buy this film, John Carpenter's "The Fog" is much better in fact I think even "Friday 13th" is much scarier then this 2005 The Fog movie. AKA. Worst movie remake ever made and hopefully Hollywood get's a wakeup call. I also seen this movie to get m own point of view cause I always believed everone is entitled to their own opinions but I see no central plot, no resolution, no climax during the film, and no inherancy what soo ever. The movie is just like Blah! I'm not sure what the director or script writer was smoking. I'm surprised even Tom Weiling stuck with playing in this movie, if I was him of course and the director called me up I would of showed up to the studio looked at the script, winked and roll ees for a bit, throw the script to the ground and leave. Of course we know what Hollywood probably did with the torn down films in the Fox Boxes what the films come in, probably took them and threw them in a heap of fire and sad "We got our gross earning next film." Bottom line worst film ever made and feel sorry for the people who couldn't turn their tickets back in to box office or could trade in their tickets at box office. I would of gave them each apology passes if I was working at their theatres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The FOG is more like a Bitter Wind.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having been a fan of the original since it was released, I went into this film with a bit of skepticism, and I'm sorry to say that despite the involvement of the original filmmakers Carpenter and the late Debra Hill, I think that it probably was a lousy idea to make it.Despite the effects are adequate and the photography is quite good, the overall "bang for your buck" on this one is pretty low.The main problem I had with it was that it failed to give us the kind of suspense and atmosphere that the material so adequately lends itself to. There was no "oh my god something's coming" kind of anxiety present in the film, and instead we have uninteresting ghosts that come out of predictable corners to attack characters we really don't care about.This FOG does go a little deeper into how the men responsible for bringing this curse onto the peaceful little town of Antonio Bay secure their fates, but by the time the bad guys start to wreak havoc we really don't care and pretty much just stick through to the end to see the carnage, which in itself is fairly unsatisfying.Oh yeah, at the end there's this whole reincarnation twist which was pointless and way too late for us to give a damn about.Everything this movie should have been, was already done in the original.Read my review if you care to know.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly Needless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This film really didn't need to be made. I love the old The Fog. It's a scary film with lots of intensity, John Carpenter behind the camera and creating some neat music, a cast of stars(albeit some very faded), and Adrienne Barbeau. Did I mention Adrinne Barbeau? Well, the new The Fog doesn't have John Carpenter, doesn't have any star power(zippo!), isn't scary at all, and doesn't have Adrienne Barbeau(who even at this stage of her life would be far more welcomed than this film I might add). What we do have is an almost exact retelling of the first film with some obvious changes made to accommodate our times. I find this trend in horror films very unnerving. You know the trend: find an old horror classic(which means something from the 70's or 80's for the dolts that produce and make these films) and "modernize" it. Give it some hip music here and there, lots of teen wannabe "stars," usually some skin(sorry don't get too excited in this FOG), and change the story just enough to make people think it is different just enough. The last one is the least important t the producers because those of us who saw these films in the 70's and 80's are not the target audience. Sadly, these are made for the teens of today. Based on that I could expect little, but get even less than I expect more often than not. You know, movies like The Fog, The Hills Have Eyes, Willard, and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre were trend setters in their own way. They were original in a variety of ways. The 70's was a decade of invention and creation and independent financing for the horror film. Shouldn't the guys making these films try and emulate that rather than bring out tired, old remakes of films that really have no business being remade in the first place. Enough! I could just go on and on. Let's get back to this disappointment at hand. This Fog isn't horrible nor any good. The story is the same but without the suspense. Like all the remakes(here I go again), The Fog is really tame in comparison to the original. Where is the horror in that? The only thing I liked about this film was the exploration into what really happened to the people on board the Elizabeth Dane. That was it.</fullReview>

A new hip remake off John Carpenter's 80's vintage horror flick where a sea side town is engulfed in a horrendous battle between the dead which consumes its victims through a fog (hence the title). "The Fog" lacks, terror, suspense and that old classic shrill down your spin but instead comes with a few known actors (Blair, Welling) who hardly do any acting whatsoever. I must say "Fog" would be considered a comedy in my opinion, because the only thing keeping me from shutting it off is how hilarious the dialogue, written by Cooper Layne, who obviously added a few touches to the original. The effects seems shoddy and lame, I thought the purpose of a million dollar effects team was to make things seem real not fake and cheap.

		<fullReview>There really is something out there in the dark. In the small town of Antonio Bay, a terrifying and force hidden within a thick and eerie fog terrorized its residents. Shrouded by the fog lies a ghastly secret of merciless revenge, one that the town's inhabitants would do well to unravel -- before it's too late. This film is obviously a remake from the John Carpenter classic which opened in 1980. This film stars TV's "Smallvile" Tom Welling, Maggie Grace and Selma Blair.I had a feeling this movie wouldn't be satisfying. I absolutely hated how it turned out and this movie has the dumbest characters who don't use their brain. When one of the characters hear and see the fog, they get out of bed and go to check and see what it is, they're walking so slow and this slow horror music is playing, they turn around and their friend is there, who just sticks his hand out to say something. These things in horror movies have to change.I didn't see the original Fog, but of course it may be a little better than this garbage. It's actually a sign that they got a PG-13 rating and not many critics were screened to view it. So it's a sign that this movie will be terrible. I hated this movie and I feel that there are other horror movies that you should see. Do not waste your time and money to see this movie. Even if you're a fan of the old one, I know you will be disappointed. I was. The Fog has cheap jump scenes that you wouldn't even jump at. Who really cares about the PG-13 rating, there won't be a difference.So let me just say again. This movie is trash, garbage and deserves to be thrown in a dumpster. I give it a 1.5/10</fullReview>

To remake this film is a mistake of the highest order; as much like Halloween, the original stands the test of time because it solidly personifies a moment in cinema history, that could never occur again...memories of a past era of cinema caught on film.I may sound cynical; but each and every remake seems to solidly bear the banner of "Cash Cow" film making, JC knows he has had his best years in Hollywood during the 70's and 80's; the current trend of "Documentary" style and realistic raw &amp; gritty filming of footage, do not compliment Mr Carpenters unique style; and he does not seem capable of moving with the times...I would warn any fan of early JC works; away from this corporate exercise in cold money making over substance.

It turned out to be a cult classic, because of it's interesting characters, amazing cast, and terrific visuals.Since the original movie wasn't flawless, how about we remake it with the help of John Carpenter and Debra Hill? Sounds good to me! How about we explore the backstory of the lepers? Sounds good! How about we cast Selma Blair as d.j. Stevie Wayne? Sounds terrific! How about we add in a backstory about Elizabeth the hitchhiker coming back to Antonio Bay so that the Blake can take her back with him to the other side? UHHHHHH...no! This new remake will go down in books as how not to remake a film. I'm not going to dump even more crap on the film. I will point out only it's good parts.Rupert Wainwright's direction is beautiful and quite atmospheric. Selma Blair is wonderful(considering the script)as Stevie and seems to be the only one trying.

Tom Welling should stick to Smallville, he is not ready for the big screen yet, at least not with this sort of crap.Save your money for something better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Fog - 2005" AKA "The Fog - Worst Re-make Ever!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know John Carpenter had a hand in this re-make of his classic film, I saw on the advertising that he was quoted as saying "even scarier than the original." I think his quote was edited and he really said "we tried to make this movie even scarier than the original - but failed miserably!" Never have I watched a film so boring. I could watch the original every day for a year and still have my adrenalin pumping and be looking over my shoulder in case the fog was coming to get me every single time. The re-make had no horror or tension anywhere. I must admit the special effects of the fog coming in were pretty good, better than the dry ice of the original, and the camera work was pretty slick, but who cares about that when watching a horror? The film only made me jump once, or rather made my girlfriend cuddled up next to me jump, causing me to spill my beer. Worst of all, you only get to see 2 or 3 people die. The rest of them were thrown through windows, I thought I was watching an episode of the A-Team - half expecting someone to jump of a roof on to one of the ghosts backs. Basically - don't watch this film. I am now going to watch the original Fog and probably soil my pants whilst watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All I can say is this movie lacked direction and script. Hand this to a group of actors and what can they do with it.There was too much information that went nowhere and had nothing to do with the story. And if that's not bad enough the film gives you visual information that has to do with the story but is never explained such as the watch beginning to tick, the injuries to the Uncle, the drunk priest, Spooner locking himself in a freezer, cousins dead body getting up and grabbing Elizabeth (did they really think she picked him up off that stretcher for fun) and let's not forget that fog bank.I am still trying to figure out a couple things: why that boat ended up in the middle of the road! How Elizabeth magically ending up in the middle of the road far from the crash scene. And what was the deal with that shower scene, really unnecessary. Look folks if you're going to show a relevant sex scene then show it otherwise don't.Some great CGI but a little too much directorial arty-ness for a horror film.So many times they did the set up to scare you but never came through.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shoddy remake of a classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do not watch this film until you have seen John Carpenter's original! This remake of THE FOG is utterly painful to watch; I cringed during some of the scenes where they had kept dialogue from the original, but made it cheesier and altogether awful. In the original, Stevie Wayne is a likable character, but in this remake she is portrayed as irritating. The same can be said for most of the other characters. The plot has changed slightly, but don't bother to try to understand it, because the film is so badly made it takes too much brain power. Where Carpenter's plot was original and clever, in this film all the good parts have been omitted and replaced with confusing and pointless ones. I wasted ?5.80 watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rupert Wainwright's remake of John Carpenter's 'The Fog' is a bit of a mess. To it's credit an attempt is made to flesh-out the thin-as-air back-story from the original movie ? the murderous complicity of the founding fathers of Antonio Bay in order to gain the finance to build their township (their victims being lepers rather than seamen, this time around) ? but this sub-plot is handled with all the subtlety of a sandpaper suppository, so there's no sense of impending menace. Anyone with half a brain can sense what's going on very quickly in the movie. Perhaps this is based upon an assumption that most people will already know the story of the original film. Fair enough, bit so, why attempt to create that back-story in the first place.There's a lot of CGI, which is pretty much par for the course in modern horror offerings, but very few of these effects work particularly well, and none are in any way original. There's also a lot of young flesh on show. Girls in their pants can be found at various points, possibly to distract us from the banality and humourlessness of the script.The performances are also fairly awful. Selma Blair tries to vest her role with a personality, but fails, chiefly because of the inadequacies of the script. Tom Welling fares little better. Worst of all ? annoyingly, as so much of the film is focused on her ? is Maggie Grace, who wanders through the film in a daze, seemingly overwhelmed by the enormity of the horror around her?the script, that is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lazy film making at it's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there ever was a strong argument against pointless remakes then this would be it!I wasn't a huge fan of the original to be truthful, but it had a story and character development.The problem with this awful remake is that it's story is incredibly sloppy and we learn from the first five minutes pretty much everything. I won't spoil it for you just in case you feel you need to see it. The plot holes come thick and fast and what we see is "anything goes". what i mean by this is: "We need the black guy to be seen as he done the killings, but he filmed what had happened" Right so to get that suspicion we have the girl from Lost magically trip over nothing into the water and lose the black guys camera. So hat happens next? The black guy runs from the hospital out of the window.....Police never chase him, looks like he got away Scott free. (I nice message to all wannabe killers)And it is this kind of sloppiness that miffs me. To think a director and a script writer did not realise what they have created is beyond me. Pure laziness if you ask me, a quick buck for no work. It's unacceptable.Characters are hugely undeveloped and are there just to look pretty. Selma Blairs role is a mere cameo, yet early on we are lead to believe a romance happening between herself and the guy from Smallville. Yet it never develops. He's girlfriend who has been away (why?!?!) and has come back and for the life of me I don't understand why he is actually with her, their on screen chemistry is absolute stone cold, which leads me to a pointless sex scene in the shower (They look bored!) with clichéd fade out's and much back rubbing. And these are the main characters! Frightful casting, to think a fairly unknown support TV actress from Lost (and easily the most annoying) and Superman was actually thought that they could carry the film is amazing to me. But as I said they weren't there to act...The support roles are even more cardboard and clichéd. We have a token African American who is beyond stereotypical and annoying person ever. The "mad misunderstood preacher who saw it all along" and others I feel I shouldn't waste my time mentioning.And finally to call this a horror is a joke the biggest scare was as cheap as your brother or sister jumping out behind a door at you every hour on the hour for a week. The scares went a little like this:Ghost knocks...Ghost jumps out at victim...Victim dies.....replay that like five times through out the movie and viola you have the suckiest movie I have ever seen! It actually offended me.So to sum this film up in a way that reflects how the film was made....Don't, it's awful (repeat five million times in the most annoying voice ever)</fullReview>

But anyway. The story line could have been so much more interesting, however ended up as one of those movies which in the end make little sense. The special effects are not quite 'B' movie class, but not that far away either. Nothing really is scary, nothing puts you on the edge of your seat. You unfortunately have to keep watching though to find out what the 'real' story behind everything is. In the end, it's not really worth knowing. Overall I was not very impressed with the film, especially after the trailers looked so good. At least there are a couple of pretty girls to keep the guys watching.</fullReview>

The movie is about a small town located on an island which was founded by 4 men. Now on the city's anniversary there's something strange happening. Mysterious treasures are washing up on shore and a fog that moves against the wind. The movie has some beautiful scenery and some impressive CGI fog and real fog. Makes me wonder how many fog machines were on set in some places... The real problem of the movie is direction, there's a few subplots that go no where and are distracting. And the end felt like it was made up at the last minute. It wasn't the worse horror movie I've seen this year, that honor goes to The Mangler Reborn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lemme first tell you that I have been reading up on the comments for this movie. Not to mention the fact that its #87 or something on bottom 25 list. That set aside, I have no understanding for why so many people would hate it the way they describe. Here, let me explain...I have seen movies far worse than this that gets a higher score on IMDb, where people tell me its so excellent. I guess its different tastes thats all, but this movie's total score really has me amazed. Anyway, compared to other horror flicks of the past years, this movie isn't really so bad.I am a horror fan by default, and I tend to like horror movies no matter how b they might be, and I have seen far worse than this one in my time. Its true, they could have done so much more with this movie if they had gotten an experienced director to make it. John Carpenter had a vision when he made the original, and to be honest, it didn't work so well for him either. The ending, which many describes as stupid, I think was more genius than having the same old "2 people survives" story, which has gotten so boring. Allowing Elizabeth to die in the end was pretty much the best way they could have done it, as they also showed her with the captain of the boat earlier in the movie. Why this doesn't make sense to people is beyond me... oh lemme guess... SHE SHOULD HAVE SURVIVES AS THEY ALL DO... lol.. well, thank god someone made it this way.Overall, I would rate this one 6 or 7 out of 10.. Perhaps I am a moron, but I liked it. I liked the special effects, and I liked the way they made it work. There is usually NO story to horror movies anyway, its about the scares and BLAMS... and it worked for me.Sorry if I am weird then :)</fullReview>

Hells yes, but I don't think that will happen right now.Until then, enjoy both movies for what they are.

		<shortDescription>Fan away this "Fog"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the rise in their popularity in recent years, horror films don't seem to be getting much scarier. In fact, quite the opposite: many recent horror films are just rehashes of material we have seen countless times before, without much anything new to offer in the mix. The new remake of The Fog is a good example. While there is potential for suspense and the film has some strong atmosphere at times, it fails to be terribly scary, for the most part.Based on a film directed by John Carpenter after he hit the big time with Halloween, The Fog is set in the small town of Antonio Bay on Antonio Island in Oregon. The town is preparing to celebrate the founding by several individuals more than one hundred years ago, including the building of a statue to commemorate the event. However, the festivities are being interrupted by a large, rather ominous fog bank which is engulfing the town. At the same time, strange objects are washing up on the beach, relics over a century old, a descendant of the town's original founders, Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) is having strange dreams concerning the town's past. Meanwhile, another descendant of the town's founders, Nick Castle (Tom Welling), is in the midst of arguing with one of the town leaders about misdirecting funds from needed repairs to the infrastructure of the city to instead be used for the dedication statue. When his partner, Spooner (DeRay Davis) are at sea and engulfed by the mysterious fog bank, people begin to die, and the very survival of anyone in the city is put into question.The Fog is an interesting idea for a horror film, with the very nature of foggy environments chilling. However, director Rupert Wainwright doesn't do much with it that hasn't been seen in countless other horror movies. Yes, there are some decent shocks here and there, but most of the movie is pretty formula, with the fake scare followed by the real one, characters not acting very smart in dangerous circumstances, and horrifying images that are, honestly, not that horrifying. The imagery of the fog is rather intimidating at times, but it doesn't really hold up for very long.Interwoven into the film are flashback scenes set in the past, showing the events that have triggered this particular attack of the fog, but the film raises more questions than it answers: why does the fog return now, what is it really after and, finally, has anyone from this city ever decided to move away, since most of the characters are descendants of the town forefathers. The Fog is not exactly an example of crack plotting.Overall, The Fog is just a big "eh" in the genre of horror films. Nothing unwatchably bad, but nothing I would recommend to anyone. Save your time and check out The Ring, or something else appropriately scary.</fullReview>

They failed at making the fog even remotely scary. Needless to say the story seemed almost not existent and strung together in some incoherent way and you'll find better plot lines in children's books. I'll be honest though, I watched the movie half-assedly dozing off once in a while. I mean, after the first half hour it was apparent that the movie would be a enormous waste of time, but I still sat through it hoping it might get better. It didn't.Also, there were numerous times people got thrown through glass and like four scenes where glass breaks. Did the writer have some some odd glass fetish or under the assumption that glass breaking is scary? The only thing good in this movie is that white chick's legs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film last night on DTV and because of the comments here I expected to turn it off after seeing just how "bad" it was. Instead it turned out to be an above average horror film with an interesting premise behind it. And it was better then the original fog, which isn't actually saying that much. I Thought there were many chilling scenes in this version especially in the last twenty minutes after the build up to the final visit from the 'Settlers'.I can not imagine where all these bad comments are coming from except that maybe todays jaded horror film audiences expect a lot of senseless gore, cursing and nudity in a film to be considered "good". This film managed to deliver the chills with out using those cheap modern day crutches and a minimum of violence. I've been a horror film fan for over 35 years and I've seen or tried to see most of the so called "good" horror films. For instance the other night I saw the Italian made 'Demons' http://imdb.com/title/tt0089013. Many viewers call that a great horror film giving it over six stars at the IMDb. I couldn't watch more than 30 minutes of it cause it was so poorly done. What it called "horror" was simple gross scenes of blood and gore one after another. 'The Fog' is way better than junk like that.No matter what people here are saying, both my wife and I enjoyed this film and recommend it to other true horror film fans. It's a throw back to the days when a horror film used atmosphere instead of gore to deliver the chills. And, Yes, the effects are good. Give this film a chance if you are mature enough, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unrated version review: another horror film that tries to outrun itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the John Carpenter film of the same name.A small fishing town is preparing to celebrate its 100th anniversary when a thick fog begins to roll in. There is something hiding within the fog and certain nasty town secrets seem to point to the explanation of what is going on. **cue the cheesy horror film music**In this age of easily accessible digital effects, this is yet another horror film, that despite great potential with the aid of these effects falls flat on its face and ends up being stupid. Like with 'Boogeyman' the story dissolves to mediocre computer images that are supposed to be scary. Not even close and definitely no cigar. Of all the horror films made before digital effects were prominent, John Carpenter's 'The Fog' could have really used computer aided help to cover up the limitations of its all practically generated special effects. Instead the film makers decided to go all out, and I really mean all out. The ghosts are computer generated, certain death scenes are, and to make things worse it is all right on screen in plain sight. Which effectively takes out any horror and creepiness that the original conjured up so well despite its limitations. Another thing is the changing around of certain character relationships: they are all cookie cutter soap opera young pretty people crap and that's quite pathetic really.The only positive thing here is the explanation of the back-story. A sequence shows us the sins that the townspeople committed back in the day and it is really the film's only good use of special effects to go along with a horror story. The other reason that you could watch this movie, back to back with the original, is for a great lesson on horror film making. Just watch the original first. 3/10DVD is unrated and has violence and horror images.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>New Fog is a Clouded Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original Fog. It was a very good and yet, little ghost story. The story was well done as was the acting and most of atmosphere. It is truly a ghostly horror classic. True the original was underrated, but as ghost stories go it was pretty solid and timeless. The characters in it, like John Houseman, etc were much more memorable and pertinent to the story. The remake is lacking. We know nothing or very little of the characters, the story is disjointed, and skips around too much. MINOR SPOILER: we hardly ever get to see or experience the vengeful ghost like we did in the first one.Even the characters are not presented in the same way, which makes it even more dull. The special effects for as advanced as they were, were also lacking in comparison to the primitive ones of the original in 1980. In a word, this movie was lacking. Lacking in everything, especially in chills and horror. Maybe this should be a lesson to filmmakers to stop remaking films. Only a few have been improved. The rest are seriously lacking. if you want a really good ghost story with some decent chills and acting, get the original, it's a classic. This should have been flushed. This remake is a clouded mess of movie that isn't even close to being as entertaining as the original. I think the director and Mr. Caprenter may have had clouded and foggy vision in making this movie.</fullReview>

It tries to be new and hip, and it's ridiculous. It's so much like the original, and yet, so much unlike it. They took everything that was creepy about the 1980 film and made it not creepy. For instance, in the original, the ghosts were always in silhouette, but in this, they actually appear as stereotypical transparent ghosts. The director even tried to add a twist, but it made for the stupidest ending in film history.The acting was even worse. Everybody in the movie except for Selma Blair, who is terrible anyway, is a TV show actor. They obviously don't know how to act in a movie. This movie was a complete bore fest. I was so disappointed.

All of the actors seemed lethargic, like ho hum... This is especially evident with the priest. Also, Maggie Grace is actually good on Lost, but seemed lost on the big screen. Her pitiful and fake screams of terror did nothing for me but make me cringe. Even Selma Blair looked bored. The movie was so predictable. The viewer has seen it so many times before that nothing the movie did was original. Scary? Not the least. Not once did I jump. Gee, I wonder if something is going to happen to the aunt when she's at the sink? The movie was a remake of the original, so nothing was new. Also, everything that happened was convenient. Finding the book? That was a joke. It was like it was no big deal to find a 134 yr. old book in perfect shape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That was HORRIBLE.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...was the first thing somebody in the dark, mostly packed theater exclaimed at the top of their lungs as soon as the ending credits started scrolling. And they couldn't have said it any better. It was plain horrible. The acting was down right offensive, and the character development was non existent. Nobody reacted to anything spooky the way anyone in real life ever would. Tell me, if you were home alone and something crashed on the outside of your house to the tune of a giant hammer pounding on your door, would you honestly grab your robe and approach the front door and go outside in the dark of night to look around to see what it was? Well apparently that's exactly what you would do, as stuff like that happened over and over in this flick. Forget the $15 for the tickets and the $10 in snacks my wife and I bought, that's just 2 hours of my life I can't get back. Although it is good for those couples out there struggling to find anything to agree upon lately. One trip to this movie, and you'll both spend the entire car ride home agreeing how pathetic this movie was, ranting and raving about how Hollywood can't make anything good anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TOTAL waste of seven bucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is THE worst movie that I have ever saw! From all the previews I had seen for it I thought it would be a really scary movie, but this movie production company should be sued for false advertisement! Hardly any of the plot flows together well enough to make a good storyline. In the advertisements the villains are depicted as more scary than they actually are. After my friends and myself saw this movie, we was all out in the parking lot going "Oh...I'm the fog! Watch out! I'll kill you." poking fun of the movie. Yes, there were a couple of jump scenes in this movie, but not enough to pay seven bucks to go see it. It's basically a digitally remastered version of the original version of "The Fog". Don't waste your money on this one! Go with your first instinct to go see "Elizabethtown" or something else instead!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not the best horror film I've ever seen (Vincent Price will always be number one in my book) but I don't regret buying this movie. Yes, it had it's slow parts (most movies have them anymore). And yes, the whole blonde-in-the-horror-movie stereotype jumped out at me. I was pretty sure she wasn't going to live to see the end of the movie. :)I don't understand the people who couldn't follow the script. The journal wasn't written by Blake - that was the captain of the ship who came back as the ghost. Why did Elizabeth fall in love with the ghost? Weren't you watching the flashbacks? Go back and look at the flashbacks showing on board the ship. Bingo - Elizabeth and Capt. Blake's wife are one and the same. She just didn't turn into a ghost like the rest of them, for whatever reason. And her name - Elizabeth? Her husband named the ship after her. I guess I'm the only one who got this. Stevie's car was hit by a truck on the highway. Her engine died, the lights turned off, and she was parked in the middle of the road. The truck couldn't see her, it hit her car, and knocked her into the water. (Now that wasn't so hard, now was it?) The townspeople died the same way the lepers on the ship died. Drowned, burned alive, knife thrown in face. I had that figured out before watching the commentary at the end of the film. Not sure how the priest's death fit in with it all, though. This movie was more like how horror movies used to be made. They weren't full of blood and gore, they were suspenseful. Maybe all ya'll like your movies more bloody and shocking, but I enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say that this film is not like John Carpenter's, but is good in its way. I know it has had very bad critics, but I do not agree. It has an interesting cast, with Tom Welling and Maggie Grace.Tom Welling has made a mistake when he spent the majority of his time contemplating how the fog causes damage and soon he recovers the speech to say something as "We must go". Some scenes are also a bit pathetic,like the one when Nick Castle's cousin is killed by a knife nailed in his eye.Or another one when a ghost is killing some people throwing them away.Even so, the film was not as bad as the reviews say. It's very entertaining, interesting and makes good fun. The new Fog does is not very scary or frightening, but I was satisfied and I liked it. See it if you want to spend a good short while, that you will not waste.</fullReview>

There are some horror movies that are actually made better by being so bad. For example, Amityville Horror 3D, made about 20 years ago, was funny because it was so bad. Unfortuantley this movie has nothing going for it.If you are foolish enough to see it you will wonder why you wasted your money and time. The week before I reluctantly went to see Wallace and Gromit and found it to be a great movie. If you see a movie see Wallace and Gromit it is sure not to disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>We have just seen this movie and thought is was quite excellent in many respects. I then came to read the comments to see why it had such a low score and have never seen such a whinefest on IMDb before.The original was very good and had some very creepy moments - the fog scene enveloping the town and radio station was better, but in all other respects this version beats it into a cocked hat.The acting, camera-work, soundtrack and action was first class and the storyline was far better. With the possible exception of the clergyman, the characters were fairly convincing and the costumes and make-up well done. The special effects also worked well enough and managed to avoid the usual sense of the ludicrous which very often creeps in at some point and spoils many similar horror films.All these sort of movies need their own quirky sort of logic to be able to work at all and this one was, at least, no worse than most - the events and action presented us with no particular problems and required no more than the usual 'suspension of disbelief'!!**SPOILERS**The burning scene on board the ship was up there with any action movie I would care to name and the last minute twist ending made a refreshing change from all the 'good guys' making it safely through the nightmare.8 out of 10 for taking a well respected, existing movie and daring to do it better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry...but, even though a lot of people know that the first movie is always going to be better than it's remake...this movie proves that theory true. There was absolutely no comparison between the movies. A lot of scenes in the movie did not make sense...where's the suspense? In my opinion, it was a waste of money. I mean...spray painting ghosts? How could the ghosts spray paint when they couldn't even open the door to the freezer? When Spooner was on the stretcher and said that they couldn't get him in there, I thought...all right! A clue...they could use a freezer to hide from the killing fog! But did they? No! It wasn't even mentioned again. And, what about that shower scene? What did that have to do with the movie? Nothing! And did anyone say anything about Nick's uncle? Something just happened to be wrong with his face but did anyone care? Nope...no one.I would rather pick my eyeballs out with toothpicks than see this movie again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Makes you wish the fog had been thicker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's resumé as a horror director is as impressive as just about any. The original version of The Fog is one of many films the director has the right to proudly look back on. Director Rupert Wainwright's resumé is not quite as accomplished. It gets no better with the garish nonsense-fest that is his similarly titled remake. Though the original was not Carpenter's finest film it was certainly better than competent, a label that wouldn't apply to this one. The film opens by revealing much of the mystery the first one saved for the end. The rest of the film is spent filling in the details and offing the occasional character in ways that are not particularly innovative, impressive, scary or interesting.Nick (Tom Welling) runs a charter fishing boat in Antonio Island, Oregon. After a successful outing with his assistant Spooner (DeRay Davis), he begins to take his charges back to the shore when his anchor catches on something heavy enough that his winch starts to pull the boat under instead of pulling the anchor up. The anchor finally comes loose but with it come a bunch of leper ghosts dressed as pirates. Wait, it gets dumber. Various relics of the past were knocked loose by the anchor and have now washed ashore. For some reason one of them starts a fire by inexplicably getting hot but the rest of them don't do anything. Spooner and Nick's cousin take Nick's boat out for a party but find trouble when the titular cloud overtakes them. Some die, some don't but you don't really care one way or another.More detailed boredom ensues with the audience finding out approximately from whence the fog came but not being entertained by the explanations. Elizabeth (Maggie Grace) and Stevie (Selma Blair) play Nick's past and current love interests but with the exception of Stevie, you can't really understand what any attraction could be because the characters have neither depth nor personality. The three are all descendants of the city's founding fathers who are to be honored in an upcoming ceremony. The fog however remembers the founding of the town differently and has other plans. There are some scenes where a little suspense is genuinely built up and the film is well shot. Compelling pictures in this case though, do not make for a compelling story.There is a good allegory to be made, as Carpenter did, about sins of the past coming back to haunt us in the present. Instead The Fog takes the past and throws it away to bury it and forget it instead of remembering and learning from it. How dumb is that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE FOG (2005) *1/2 Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, Selma Blair, DeRay Davis, Kenneth Welsh, Adrian Hough, Sara Botsford, Cole Heppell, Mary Black, Rade Serbedzija. (Dir: Rupert Wainright)As thick(headed) as pea soupIn yet another uninspiring remake of a cult horror classic Hollywood continues to rub salt in the wounds of audiences seeking out a decent genre flick (or at the very least a better than expected 're-imagining') in the latest bastardization with a limp re-hash of John Carpenter's cult ghost story with some laughable results.Namely in Cooper Layne's boring screenplay adaptation by adding more back story than was necessary (in this case a leper colony being destroyed by the founding fathers of the sleepy hamlet of the inlet of Antonio Bay which is preparing for a celebratory induction of a statue erected of the very pioneers who betrayed a trust between the lepers that were killed off for riches instead. Unknowingly unearthing at sea the bundles of the aforementioned booty by charter boat skipper Nick Castle ("Smallville"'s Welling) leading to the titular stormy accumulation that will eventually unleash hell and vengeance seeking ghouls.To add any more to the 'plot' such as it is only enhances what could have been an exciting boost to the spooky Carpenter flick with its atmospheric dread lurking behind every smoke-grey cloudburst spiraling into the township with God knows what waiting in its shadows. Instead filmmaker Wainright (responsible for the egregious "Exorcist" rip-off "Stigmata" follows blindly the inept followings with groaning puns, lackluster scares (yes someone actually gets their shoulder touched followed by a boo! sting of music) and wooden performances (Grace of TV's blockbuster "Lost" gives new dimension to pine as Welling's girlfriend who has some unearthly and ridiculous link to the historical tragedy that truly upsets the incredibly stupid finale) only make it a sore endeavor for those paying to witness this atrocious remake. There seem to be some chunks of story missing (i.e. one character suddenly has leprosy like facial sores inexplicably and seems to wander into every fifth sequence for no reason). Even Blair seems bored in her fitting into Adrienne Barbeau's single-mother DJ in the lighthouse character adding nothing new to the feisty character. The visual effects are mixed from not-too-shabby to kinda lame.When will someone in Hollywood finally say, "NO! Leave well enough alone!" There's absolutely no reason for this remake or for anyone to go see it. Rent the 1980 version instead and guarantee a shiver or two.</fullReview>

Maybe it has too much in common with other likewise movies these days, but i felt that this one didn't have too much of Hollywood in it (read cheap lines and bad acting which doesn't make the movie believable). Don't misunderstand me, i love Hollywood but they tend to go easy on remake of movies like this.If you like films in this category, rent it and have a good time.Enjoy</fullReview>

The movie just about killed me myself, I mean I saw an old man almost have a heart attack in the movie; and not for the scariness but for how Sukey it is. Don't worry, I asked him why he almost had a heart attack and he said it was for how much a certain part of the movie sucked. Just don't see the movie at all, but if your wandering if its OK for kids to see I would say yes. Only go with your kids if your taking a pillow and blanket.

		<shortDescription>Avoid this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw The Fog with my school and didn't think much of it. In the trailers, it showed this good horror/thriller movie, but when you see it, I personally thinks it belongs somewhere else. Sure, there were moments that made you jump, but no horror. Tom Welling wasn't suited for the role Nick Castle, nor was Maggie Grace as Elizabeth Williams. One, it introduced characters that were in maybe one scene in the film, so you had no idea who they were. The story of the founders needed to be more detailed, not just showing some scenes and others. The theature was so crowded for a movie with horrible writing and acting, that I heard muttering about how it 'sucked' from others. I recommend you avoid this movie at all costs, it is a waste of money. Yes, it had a few good cinematic effects, but the first hour was murder. As I said, horrible. I almost fell asleep during the movie.There were maybe one or two funny parts, but other then that the movie basically had no basis. It needed much more detail about everything, the fog, the characters, even the dogs. A waste of money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trick to Enjoying this Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story takes place in the small, secluded town of Antonio Bay, which is falling victim to a deadly fog containing revenge-seeking lepers killed many years ago by the town's 4 founding fathers. The beautiful Tom Welling ("Smallville") does a great job with his acting. His character is believable and he pulls it off well. Undoubtedly the best part of the movie. Maggie Grace and her character seemed a bit bland to me. Not particularly horrible, but the character definitely could've been portrayed better. I liked Selma Blair and DeRay Davis. They both did good jobs. A good part of the movie was the CGI and special effects which were both well done. Images were spooky, but not necessarily scary. The movie as a whole wasn't scary at all. The scariest parts being some of the more graphic images and unexpected loud noises, which aren't even bad (scariness-wise). The movie wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible. The storyline was predictable for the most part (although the ending did leave me a bit confused) and it wasn't scary. I did enjoy the movie, however. The trick is really just to walk into the theater not expecting much. I didn't walk in hoping to see some fantastic horror movie. I was expecting a movie with a straightforward plot with some run-of-the-mill scares. It was pretty much what I expected, so I wasn't disappointed. Just go and take it for what it's worth and enjoy it for what it was supposed to be: a good, old-fashioned ghost story. I'd recommend this as a good movie to see if 1.) You're looking for a fun Halloween flick to see with some friends, or 2.) You're a big fan of Tom Welling. If you like him, it'll be worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to this movie expecting a cheap thrill and nothing more. I didn't expect a cheap thrill to be so much fun.Sure, there was enough predictability to make one think, "I knew that was going to happen", but then they come up with a "gotcha"! Surprisingly, the "gotcha" was what one didn't predict. Just when you finished patting yourself on the back, you may find yourself a few inches off the seat. If you anticipate anything at all, you will find yourself surprised on several occasions.Tom Welling from Smallville was very good although he can do better and I am sure he will. Everyone else did fine. Selma Blair contributed plenty to the movie. Maggie Grace came out of the fog with a few scratches but she was good to watch as well.Essentially, the film makers kept their audience in enough of a fog to keep interest alive. Not only that, but for a remake, they did a very good job. They brought modern technology to the movie and mixed in some good old "scary movie" technique.Fine movie. Gets a gracious 7 from me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember John Carpenter's 1980 film THE FOG but only very vaguely so looked up my review of the 1980 version where I wrote that it was a moody and atmospheric horror . I can see what the producers of this remake were trying to do and that is recreate the atmosphere of the original and even though they try there seems to be something missing . I'm not saying this is a great film and by doing a fairly straight remake it shows signs of laziness on the part of the studio but it probably deserves a slightly higher average rating of 3.6 Perhaps the main problem is the casting . Tom Welling , Selma Blair and Maggie Grace ? A little bit too pretty and young compare them with the cast of the original who did tend to look like "real people" for a better phrase and were of a wider age demographic . Ah I think I might have hit the nail on he head . This remake tries to pander to the teen demographic where a senior citizen is anyone on the wrong side of 30 . There's also a bit more incidents involved almost as though the studio think teens will be bored senseless if nothing much is happening which means everything is a bit clichéd . Perhaps worst of all the film feels the need to explain the ending and how it ties in with the rest of the narrative where as the original is left open ended and ambiguous and if a film needs to spoon feed the audience information in a clumsy way this can only be seen as a failure . As I said it's not a great film but probably no worse than the other vapid and insipid remakes we've seen over the last ten years</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly enjoyable and impressive remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a series of strange encounters, a small sea-town comes to believe the fulfillment of a deadly curse is being brought upon by a series of malicious ghosts and try to stop it before it's too late.Quite frankly, this is a highly underrated effort that's one of the more enjoyable remakes among this current crop. One of the only true flaws to this is the lower rating which does harm this one. The kills here really lack any sort of impact or brutality with the lack of blood throughout here, and the other attacks have a slightly less intense bite to them than they otherwise would with a darker tone to this. There's also the act that this one tends to overplay its scenes far longer than they're worth, which is slightly odd in that it makes for overlong and overly dramatic scare scenes that overstay their welcome at times and instead drains some of their impact. Still, there's a lot to like here in the fact that the build-up in here is incredibly well-done with this one featuring the early visions of the ships' fate along with the items washed ashore both creating a rather fine and exciting set-up as well as the burgeoning mystery they lead to surrounding the sudden appearance of the journal explaining everything that finally puts everything together. That helps makes scenes like the ambush or sea or the supernatural activities in the radio station to seem all the more enjoyable as well as being highly suspenseful by milking the idea of the fog being a malevolent entity in this one. The scenes of it moving through town, surrounding buildings and weaving along the hallways makes for a thoroughly chilling scenario about what's trapped in the fog. When it finally pays that off in the final half causes this to be all the more enjoyable and entertaining by making for a rather chilling connection with the back-story given already in here which is where this one gets the most out of its storyline. That also helps to make for a really fine finale by really getting the good attacks and really creepy scenarios in here that really make for a high-note ending here which really sells this one. The last part to like here is the rather inspired amount of suspense in here, from the attack on the lighthouse worker and the fog chasing the family through the house to even shorter scenes with the trapped car underwater, the fake-drowning in the outhouse or the final assault in the library which makes for some really good times in here. While they may seem a little like a cop-out, these make it enjoyable enough.Rated PG-13: Violence, some Language and shadowy Nudity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>bland remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The town of Antonio Island, Oregon is unveiling a statue honoring the four founders; Patrick Malone, Norman Castle, Richard Wayne and David Williams in 1871. However the four men had been less than honorable. Nick Castle (Tom Welling) runs his own fishing boat, the Seagrass. His girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island after six months in NYC. Stevie Wayne (Selma Blair) is the radio DJ out the lighthouse. There is some strange occurrences, gruesome deaths, and a mysterious fog.This is a remake of the original John Carpenter movie from 1980. I wasn't really a big fan of the original and this is a poor copy. At least the original had a creepy atmosphere and Adrienne Barbeau. This one doesn't have anything in comparison. The production and the acting is so bland. It's like nobody aspires to do better. There is also something about the CGI fog. Its fakeness took me out of the movie. It's not scary and it's not suspenseful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Spit in the Face to the Original Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog remake of 2005 might be the worst horror remake out there and that is saying a great deal. There are dozens of bad horror remakes out there like the remake of Halloween, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Prom Night, Psycho, etc., but at least they had some degree of effort put into them. Those remakes, as bad as they are, at least tried to do something different and to be entertaining, but this film has almost nothing going for it. The Fog is a classic horror film, as well as one of my favorite horror movies of all time, and I am saddened that they treated it so poorly with the remake. This movie has almost no good actors, no good performances, no scares, no suspense, no atmosphere, and no entertainment value.The story is pretty much the same as the original. 100 years ago a group of leopards came to the town of Antonio Bay, California to set up a colony. However, the townspeople tricked them into crashing their ship and drowning. Now these leopards have returned to get their revenge aided by a supernatural fog.Where do I begin describing what is wrong with this film. The film has no good characters and hardly any good casting save two. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are in this film. I am a fan of Tom Welling through Smallville and Maggie Grace through Lost, but neither of them is given anything to do and the script does not let them show off their acting talent at all. All the other characters are basic horror film stereotypes like the token comic-relief black guy. Most of these characters are just here to be used as cannon fodder. The original film had interesting characters with great actors playing them, while this has nothing.The worst thing about this film is that it is ungodly boring. The original film had a great atmosphere, but there is no atmosphere to speak of here. It is not even remotely scary. I kept waiting for a scary moment but it never came even at the end. The score was nothing, while the score in the original is very memorable. The ghosts are not remotely scary, mainly because they are all bad CGI. The CG in this film is some of the worst I have seen. Even the fog is CGI. In the original the ghosts were all silhouettes and done all practically. Everything was done with practical effects, while here everything is horrible CGI.The messed up the story really bad as well. First of all we are told that the leopards were killed in 1880, but in the present time we are celebrating the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay even though the film clearly takes place in 2005. So the makers of the film cannot even tell time right. The ghost's motivations are really weird as well. We assume they came back for revenge like in the original, but it does not seem like it. At the end of the film the head ghost (spoiler) turns Maggie Grace into a ghost then they all leave (spoiler end). So the ghosts did not even get their revenge. The ending makes absolutely no sense.Overall, this film is complete garbage and a spit in the face to the original. Skip it at all costs and just watch the original. I would recommend any horror remake over this honestly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish I could have been privy to the producers meeting when The Fog remake was first mooted as the finished film plays out like a producer was simply given a basic summary by a friend who had caught Carpenter's original on cable the night before and they just drew the script from that without bothering to see the film for themselves. The 1980 original, while not perfect, has a great sense of atmosphere and really creepy protagonists - most notably Captain Blake, joined by his decomposing undead crew and their nasty hooks. In the remake, we get Superlad pouting manfully and Maggie Grace as the damsel in distress to give the film that all-too-important 'teen appeal' (although it's a shame that Liam Neeson didn't show up to get all CIA on the ghosts - I would have bought that for a dollar!). And, while I like Selma Blair, she is not given a role that equates to Adrienne Barbeau's marvellous and gutsy turn as Stevie Wayne. In a nutshell, then, the film is not scary or remotely effective, and the CGI is no replacement for the visceral effects of the original. But the biggest problem are the ghosts, and I can't begin to imagine the script session that pitched replacing Captain Blake's rotted and leprous visage and wickedly sharp weapons with a transparent, bearded Rade Serbedzija wielding a (wait for it)......silver-topped cane! If they ever go for a remake of The Burning they should replace Cropsy's deadly garden shears with two Mars bars as his implement of slaughter - so much scarier (think of the calories!). Oh, yes, and there is a bit of hokey reincarnation and human-to-ghost romance, too. Perhaps if Jamie Lee Curtis had hooked up (see what I did there!) with Captain Blake, all of that murderous unpleasantness could have been avoided. In the end, The Fog (2005) just needs to get lost in the mist of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My 1st BAD movie review on IMDb but i've wanted to warn people about this since I first saw it back in 2005. I'd normally focus on Films i've enjoyed but this was just AWFUL.WHY oh WHY was this Remade? The Original is one of my favourite ALL-TIME Horror films. The Original has a cool, scary atmosphere conjured up by a director at the top of his game in 1979 with a great performance from Adreinne Barbeau as Stevie Wayne and Hal Holbrook playing one of the all time favourite Horror Movie characters...Father Malone.I was shocked to learn that the original Fog only currently scores a 6.8 rating!!! with this remake scoring 3.5!!!Now I don't think Tom Welling, Maggie Grace &amp; Selma Blair are ever going to be GREAT actors but i've seen them in other stuff (Tv's Smallville, Lost and with Blair in Hellboy) and they are perfectly fine but in this film they just bored the hell outta me with each passing minute.The makers tried to jazz things up with a big laughable special effects ending, possibly trying to make up for the rest of the yawn fest.This is COMPLETELY Different in tone, style &amp; atmosphere to the Original. If I could go back in time &amp; sabotage this remake I would.3.5!!! GENEROUS I say. RocketeerFlyer gives this one a going down 1/10 (0.5 each for pretty SELMA &amp; MAGGIE)If you have NEVER seen any of "The Fog" Movies STAY AWAY from this remake and treat yourself to the Original Classic which rates a 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since nearly everyone else has panned this flick, I'll keep it short and simple. This movie is a waste of your time and, or, money. The surprising thing is that John Carpenter was very disappointed with the 1980 version, so he was all gung-ho to help out with the remake. Alas this remake wouldn't even scare 5 year-olds, the CGI's are so bad they looked like they were rendered by an old cold war era computer. I've seen low budget movies that had CGI's that would make the major studios green with envy, so there is NO excuse for bad CGI's in this day and age, but there are and it's just pure laziness on the part of the studio. This could have been an excellent horror movie about justice and revenge but, instead, it's a barely coherent mess that feels rushed and sloppy. Instead of watching this movie you could find something scarier in your sock drawer or maybe try balancing your checkbook, watching paint dry is slightly more entertaining than watching this clunker of a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is it possible for fans of the John Carpenter original to be objective with this remake? Is it possible for a modern audience fed on Gorno and Slice Dice horror genres to be objective also? Well I like to think that as a man in middle age I can be very objective and rate the film accordingly, so with that in mind I happily admit to being a member of both the above groups I have mentioned. This smacked of a bad idea when it was first mooted but it came as no surprise to anyone who can see that mainstream cinema had at this time in film history simply run out of great ideas for movies. This is real bad and I avoided it for so long, but the fact that his royal highness John Carpenter was lending his name to the project always kept me interested, it was the itch I was destined to scratch at some point.It's poorly directed, badly acted, in fact there is a scene with four people on a boat (two of each sex) that is so badly acted you would be surprised if these actors ever worked again! The pic is devoid of suspense, jump shocks and worst of all, an ending that is as dreary as it is insulting. I give it 2/10 for the sound mix only. An awful abomination.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do they always come back?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Why did it come back? For revenge? Or justice? Or maybe to claim something lost long, long ago? Maybe we'll never know. But one thing's for sure. Something did come back ... Sooner or later, everything does"Why did "The Fog" come back?Because it could be done better than the original horror classic? Not even close.This film had a few good moments, saving it from the dreaded one star rating, but it is greatly inferior to the original masterpiece by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, which I will likely watch many times in the future. I will not watch this film again.The good:Occasional nice cinematography.Images of story elements not in the original were well done, but I would take John Houseman telling the campfire ghost story to the children on the beach at the beginning of the original over this addition every time.The bad:The acting was amateurish and the characters were shallow and ridiculous. I had no sympathy for them.Showing copious amounts of too young female skin and a sex scene that is gratuitous during the first half of the movie is of no value and is always a sign of a bad film in need of CPR. Sure, Adrienne Barbeau provided some eye candy in the original, but she had the aspect of a mature woman.Special effects over substance. No thanks.It is not scary; a bad sign for a film that is supposed to be scary.The ending which showed some promise, was reduced to complete absurdity.Why do they always come back?I should know better than to view the remake of a classic movie, but because of the rare exception, "Nosferatu" comes to mind, it is worth giving it a chance. (I now pledge to never watch the remake of "The Hills Have Eyes")The original has some great acting, with the mother-daughter duo of Janet Leigh ("Psycho"!) and Jamie Lee Curtis (scream queen of"Halloween" fame), the aforementioned Ms. Barbeau and John Houseman, and Hal Holbrook, among others. The cinematography is beautiful. The score by John Carpenter is one of the best. It is great work of film art. It is tense and scary, which is what we horror fans want.Check out the original, it is a must see film, and skip this poor imitation, which is not even a good film on its own merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why remake it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes rarely work and this one certainly doesn't. It retains enough of the original and adds some vague twists to it. If I'm honest, the original had a few loopholes, but at least it was scary. I bought the DVD to see Tom Welling in a role he was the right age for and to see Maggie Grace in something else. Both are good actors, but somehow the whole package just doesn't work. The scares that are put in don't work for some reason. There's very little tension and even the 'jump' moments aren't really frightening. The famous body rising scene in the morgue just looks like a guy desperate for a date. And the extra baggage of back story only seems to prove how preposterous the original story was. Trying to make extra sense of it only dilutes the possibilities. It also takes a hell of a long time for the fog to actually make a full appearance! I've put a spoiler in here because I'm discussing the plot, but really anyone who's seen the original already knows much of it, despite the slightly bizarre extras the new film has included. When the ship is first seen it's really eerie, but the murders are just not that frightening. The original film was flawed, but it had atmosphere and tension. Unfortunately the new version just has fog.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior version from Carpenter's classic with youthful casting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This second version concerns about a centennial seaside small town of Antonio Bay ,California .The sleepy location was built by a founders over the victims of a horrible crime.Nowadays a Zombies like ghosts are seeking avenge for their deaths and are returning to revenge themselves on the town inhabitants which stole them their gold these hundred years before and they claim retribution.Undercover of the fog they carry out their vicious attacks ,murders and mayhem against the residents(Sara Bostford and Kenneth Welsh among others).A young girl (Maggie Grace in the role of Janet Lee Curtis)with similar name to the ghost ship,Elizabeth Dane, and her boyfriend(Tom Welling in the role of Tom Atkins)confront against the vengeful ghosts and a radio commentator(Selma Blair in the role of Adrienne Barbeau)try to salve her son.The picture contains suspense,horror,scabrous killings ,shocks and lots of blood and gore.The movie takes accent as the suspense well as the fantasy with the fog apparition. The splendid original film is made a new treatment with younger actors and better special effects.The main casting are television actors(Maggie Grace: Lost and Tom Welling: Smallville) though with wide future career and the supporting cast are frankly well .Gore and violence abound including decent scares with tense horror sequences.The grisly murders are scary and creepy but are executed alive burn people,authentic massacre with nauseating and gruesome assassinations by crystal,knife or cleaver.Eerie score musical by Graeme Revell though I miss the frightening music by John Carpenter.The motion picture is regularly directed by Rupert Wainwhright(Stigmata) and was produced by Debra Hill(recently deceased) and Carpenter.It's a formulaic and regular attempt to cash in on the success of original and superior The Fog.The movie will like to terror fans but contains a roller-coaster dark suspense and disturbing fear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Got Lost In The Fog!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you ever been lost in the fog? Not only is it hard to see something, but when you do see, it is too late. The remake of The Fog was well done and it had some scary moments. Are you ready to watch a bunch of dead lepers come back for revenge? As the mist creeps into Antonio Bay, so does the leper ghost of the past. These scary ghosts come to bring vengeance upon the descendants responsible for their deaths. They all become unwitting victims as the fog fills the town. No one is more unwitting than bewildered and dumb Maggie Grace.Maggie Grace(TV'S "Lost") needs to take some medication in this movie! She clearly had some foggy thinking, one moment she was making sense and the next you want to choke her! You will get "LOST" with Maggie Grace in this film(Pun intended).After she saw three people dead on a boat, she realizes something is wrong, she watches a video clearly demonstrating some crazy demonic fog behavior. She is having dreams about people burning up in the fire, and that she is dead underwater. Next she goes and talks to a priest and says, "There is something wrong isn't there?" What gave her the first clue? Is this a remake of "The Fog" or Clueless? If you saw three dead people on a boat and watched a video where a knife magically flew through the air and killed someone, would you stick around? This girl stayed when anyone with an ounce of sense would run for their lives! Maggie Grace was the most annoying feeble-minded character throughout the movie.Tom Welling thought Maggie was a basket-case and he should have dumped her and went after Selma Blair(Hot Radio DJ Chick). Tom Welling does get lucky at the end of the movie, as Maggie Grace disappears into the mist with creepy dead leper man.The filming was well done and there were some creepy looking leper ghost people. I thought the dead shadow look of the long-dead mariners was creepy and made the movie more entertaining. The effects with the fog looked great and the eerie mist produced a horrific sense of terror.You will notice that the leper scenes on the boat could have been more disgusting. Maybe an eye ball could have fallen out of someone's head or maybe a hand rolling around on the boat deck. Even if a leper's head fell off, that would have been the icing on the cake! Imagine Tom Welling with a superman's outfit driving like a mad crazed lunatic with Maggie Grace next to him and you have a winner! Seriously, this movie was not the worst and the acting was not the best, but it was creepy. You may discover, as I did that Tom Welling should stick to Smallville and stay away from fog ville.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just forced myself to watch this movie after trying' to watch it several times before.I am a fan of John Carpenter's The Fog from 1980 and I thought he did real good on the movie with it being low budget. This one though, I can't believe Mr' Carpenter and Miss Hill had anything to do with it. This movie just plainly sucked. First off, it takes place in CA. not the north west. Kathy Williams ( the mayor like woman) and Elizabeth are not mother and child. Elizabeth was a hitchhiker passing through in the 1980 The Fog, not from the town like she is in this one. Spooner, what is up with this guy? He was never in the 1980 version, why put people in that never were in the first? Miss Wayne never left the Lighthouse in the first version. She stayed on the radio to keep the people informed on where the fog was heading as it came into town. She never got into a car wreck like she does in this remake( she never had a car in the first, she had a jeep or something like that). And the priest, why was he even in this remake? He played a big part to why things were happening in the first movie but, this one he is more or less a drunk. And Miss Wayne's son finds a plank on the beach in the first movie that ends up saying 6 must die. This remake has the kid finding a hair brush that washed up on the beach that shows things that have nothing to do with the real movie. This remake was made with mainstream America in mind like 99% of all remakes are these days. I say see the first movie with an open mind then see this one and you will understand what I am talking about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't have the foggiest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1980, John Carpenter brought us his version of the Fog. That movie was brought forth a really creepy atmosphere that still echos today.25 years later, Rupert Wainwright brought forth the remake of The Fog, and like most remakes, saying that "it failed miserably to live up to the original" is a gross understatement.Many of the names are similar or the same, along with the basic plot. It was a nice touch of adding on the situation of how the fog began, but it was just as effective, if not more so, just by letting someone read the legend from a book back in 1980. The overall eeriness of this version was practically non-existent. The added situation, or perhaps destiny of Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) was interesting, but was a tad pointless.And Tom Welling's acting? The dead looked more alive than him.It's overall pace was seriously lax, but it was intriguing enough just for a view once on a DVD.Give The Fog ..... 2.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the movie not to long ago and I thought it was okay. It's not the best movie ever but is at least worth the rental money. Semla Blair and Tom Welling saved the movie from being a total flop, in my opinion. Selma is so smart in her character and for such a small roll she made it really come to life, so I applaud her performance. It shouldn't really qualify as a horror movie because it doesn't contain most of the normal 'horror' elements that most others have. I was surprised to find that most of the fog used in the movie was not CG and it was, in fact, real and man-made. The location and scenery is beautiful. Also, the movie is supposed to take place on an island called Antonio Island, Oregon.I'll have you know that there are no islands in the state of Oregon, Ishould know, I live in Oregon. But Hollywood can make up places, Iguess. Again, in my opinion, I do think that Maggie Grace did a good job because her character has'layers' that she shows and demonstrates well. It did get boring in some parts but over all it was fairly good and somewhat interesting and not a lot of gore(thank goodness).</fullReview>

They seem to rely on the fact that maybe the viewer has already seen the original to fill in all the story gaps?? Really couldn't help thinking of the Disney Haunted Masion theme park ride while watching the "scary" ghosts approach the town. The original far outshines this "re-imagining" of a classic suspense film that was great in its way...that took a page from Hitchock-ian classics and let the viewer imagine the monsters...this use of FX only makes the movie campy and predictable. I also disagree that Selma Blair was a good addition to this mediocre cast...she has a face for the big screen but not a voice for radio. It sounded lack luster and was poor by comparison with Adrienne Barbo.Let sleeping lepers lie! This movie did not need to be made.</fullReview>

I almost fell asleep on this dreck many times. It lacks everything that made the original a classic ghost story. The actors don't seem to be trying at all. And I can see why given their characters. The original had adults playing parts that were written for adults. It seems everyone responsible here tried to turn into a "teenie-bopper" horror film. They even had the token black character that had no place in the movie. When are we going to retire that stereotype? What's really funny about the whole thing is reading the interviews with Wainwright where he dogs the original Fog and says it's ripe for a re-do. What a joke. I find it very sad that this was Debra Hill's last movie. Let's remember her for the Greats. Rest in Peace Debra.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For all of those out there who are horror movie fans, i have a few words to say... DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE!!! OK, then, so that's not my decision, but if you are thinking about seeing this then be warned-you may never want to see a Horror movie again! As if a remake wasn't enough, this soppy ghost story fails as a horror movie, as a drama, as a thriller-in fact as anything. The story resolves around a mysterious fog that causes havoc on a remote island with a lighthouse. Okay, so the story is Corny, but hey, who cares? The original Fog with Jamie Lee Curtis was a nice little shocker, and John Carpenter made sure the scares were proud and bold. This version is so laughably drib and unscary, your average episode of Balamory is more moving. A terrible waste of everyone's time...mainly yours. Go see a real hardcore Horror movie, and avoid this evil contraption. You will come out of the Movie Theatre cursing it, and yourself...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had some expectations that this movie might be an improvement over the original not-so-good film, but was I wrong! This movie is terrible and a perfect example of how not to make a remake. The acting was pathetic. The atmosphere was destroyed by the amateur acting "talents" of the principal players. The guy who played Nick (Tom Wellington from Smallville) is surely one of the worst actors in movies today. He is completely unbelievable in this part. He thinks he is so cool and I guess that gets in the way of any attempt at acting he might be able to try. He doesn't even look good either, despite the heavy layers of make-up, the gobs of mascara, and the colored contacts. He is looking too old to try to play a "pretty boy" any longer and it shows too! He goes around never getting very emotional or excited about anything (I guess he is afraid he will mess up his make-up). One thing is certain and that is he was very miscast in this part (it ruined the whole movie). He would have been perfect for one of the gay cowboys in Brokeback Mountain, because he acts and looks so very, very gay.The original movie was frustrating and this one is more so. There is not much of a plot to be found, no frights at all, and a completely asinine story. The whole thing is just pathetic and really boring and I do mean boring! I can't believe that John Carpenter had his name in the credits! He should have given up after his first attempt with The Fog. The most frightening thing about the first film was Jamie Lee Curtis doing a topless scene revealing her mosquito bites, and the most frightening thing about this travesty was that some idiot made it in the first place. It does not even deserve to be watched unless one is desperate and even then one will be very disappointed! Avoid this disaster at all costs and it flat out gets no stars at all because it is a bomb of the greatest magnitude! I had to give it one but that was because there was no other choice!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this on DVD and I would have to agree with the other reviewers. This really was a terrible movie (and I usually give most horror movies a chance because I love the genre). There were many plot holes that didn't make sense, the only 'scares' were those VERY ANNOYING jump scares that really aren't scary at all. Even if you're a hard core horror fan, DON'T waste two hours of your life with this crap. Rent the 1980 version which is pretty good. SPOILERS AHEAD: Things that didn't make sense and/or were annoying. 1. Why did the one dockland with the dogs have leprosy. 2. Was Elizabeth really stupid enough to fall into the water with the video camera? 3. Was Elizabeth a reincarnated version of the woman with leprosy?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A thriller of it's kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You wouldn't get too many of these thrillers which dig into the past to find a lurking question unanswered. The plot is set on an island in Oregon. An FM station airing from a lighthouse, a small population with innocent notions about their forefathers and a series of 'get-nowhere' clues. You may not find this movie theatrical but the cinematography makes up for it. The title of the movie is a funny fit. Mysteriously, it somehow finds itself in few scenes. Apart from it, the movie is great. This isn't a typical horror movie. If you enjoyed awesome movies like 'Ghostship', etc., this one is for you. This movie deserves a good rating. It made my afternoon.</fullReview>

I enjoyed it from start to finish. Although it does not match up to the original it tries hard. It has some pretty effective jump scenes. The atmosphere was decent. I enjoyed the flash backs and the death scenes (despite absence of blood) were done well. Though there were some strange bits which had no point to them and were probably done for the sake of having strange scenes. Dinner Table On The Beach = What the f**k.</fullReview>

Some bad acting, and of course they killed at the end when they revealed the ghosts. I liked it when it was just the FOG killing people and you were continually guessing whats going on! but the scariest part of the movie was in the beginning credits about 2 min in to the Film As the names were fogging off the screen a figure appeared. I took a picture of it and its scared the crap out of me! If interested, go back and rent the movie. I don't think Sony Pictures planned the image, at least i don't' think they did. I know I'm not crazy but i do believe in spirits and when you all see it you will believe it too. It's right before the man on the boat holds up his lantern and there is a name and the the figure appears Freaky! and e-mail me when anyone sees it!</fullReview>

Since the original film came out in 1980, and I don't think I've watched it again since then, I can't compare the two.The acting isn't Shakespearean, but this is a John Carpenter film, not a Kenneth Branagh film.If you want porn action, watch a porn flick.

		<fullReview>Rarely it seems does a horror film get good reviews or scores on a scale of one to ten, but honestly this was a significant improvement over the original in 1980, and unlike the original, this film strived to at least trace the origins of the vengeance enacted on Antonio Bay which gives the viewer a better understanding of the story.I give this a higher mark of eight simply because as far as contemporary horror films go, this one at least kept me interested and incredibly I didn't find myself laughing like I would during most gore flicks mainly because at least this one tries to take itself seriously, along the lines of 'The Grudge' and 'The Ring' both of which got higher scores than this did by IMDb users.Give it a try if you're looking for some easy, digestible entertainment and aren't adverse to the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quite good really</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the first half of this film, if not more was actually very good. The tension was effectively built and had the potential to make the weak-hearted jump. It uses a very contemporary soundtrack and has stylistic similarities to the I Know What You Did Last Summer type film. It is only spoilt by the unrealistic and unconvincing ending. Had the film continued as it had began I think it would be an effective thriller in line with Final Destination. This film, by the end is more laughable with similarities to Final Destination 2 although an enjoyable experience if watched with a few drinks on a Saturday night and taken lightheartedly. I would watch it again and in general don't think it deserves the pants reviews it has received, although it will not induce the same iconic status and cinematic experience of the original a quarter of a century ago.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing more or less than what one expects when watching this type of flick. Whether it's a ghost ship, or a kid in a lake, some evil is trying to exact revenge on a bunch of dimwits who just don't get it. They always stay and most of them die except the ones we are supposed to care about because they seemed innocent or bared a breast. Unfortunately in this one there weren't any boobies other than the townsfolk. The effects weren't all that bad just cheesy in some scenes. The acting was average TV, maybe lifetime quality. It is OK for a DVD rental if you like this type of plot. Hardly worth seeing at theater prices. Ten years old and younger children may be frightened. Good stuff for MST 3000 type of viewing where a bunch of people make sarcastic comments while watching a B movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that sank.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never written a comment on any movie but i felt compelled and obligated to do so after watching the fog remake. I had to register with IMDb just say this: Please don't watch this movie!! Watch the original is indeed good advice.The plot based on the original had very scary elements which was promising - trapped on an island, mysterious fog, ghost from past out to get you - but sadly the director really stuffed up this one. Here are a few examples: 1. How can you pass out underwater and suddenly *wake up* surprised? If you pass out underwater chances are you're dead! This scene happened TWICE in the movie and i laughed out loud each time. 2. The overused clichéd special effects especially the lame breathing and knocking on door sound. It seems that knocking on any door (of any wood) produces the same sound! 3. The nonsensical dialogue. The hero tells his girlfriend to hide a video camera from the police because it might prove their friends' innocence of murder. Er...giving the police might help actually! 4. The hero comes up from below the ship and tells his girlfriend that hes found a dead body. She then hears a sound below and goes down ALONE to check it out! "I think i heard a scary sound but ill just check anyway, er plus there's a dead body there too!" Wow classic Hollywood. 5. The bad acting. nothing to elaborate. it is that bad. 6. The narrative style ending. That made me laugh.The list goes on and on. I don't remember the original movie that well but even with a scary plot (which could have been easily exploited) AND computer generated effects wont stop this remake from sinking. I wish i read the review before watching. I really want that 3 hours of my life back!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE FOG is a reasonably scary and slightly gorier remake of John Carpenter's 1980 THE FOG. Why it was made, however, I have no idea. It does not appear to have been shot on the cheap, with loads of CGI effects and a fairly large cast, so I am not sure how the filmmakers expect to make back their investment. Basic plot: On the 100th anniversary of a small island community, a mysterious fog rolls in, followed by a ghost ship, and people promptly start dieing. The cast is mostly B-level/TV actors, most prominent among them being Tom "Smallville" Welling. The action sequences keeps things moving along at a satisfying pace. Some of the more chilling effects from the original, such as loud thudding and pounding, are re-employed here. One problem, however: the director shows way too much of the vengeful ghosts, especially in the second half. And the incredibly sappy ending has nothing to do with the original, that I can tell you. Kids and very young adults, for whom this was made, will eat this up. You have to figure anyone under the age of 20 likely has never seen nor heard of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOLIERS*** John Carpenter's superbly stylish ghost story caught critics totally by surprise way back in 1980: most were expecting more of the (alleged) bloodletting that had made HALLOWEEN the single most counterfeited "spatter" movie of all time; but Carpenter once again eschewed the gallons of glistening gore served up in such heapin' helpin's by his would-be emulators and gave us a "Flying Dutchman" tale of terror the likes of which we hadn't seen since the heyday of Val Lewton and company. Not for the last time did this filmmaker confound expectations and deliver something of lasting merit. The folks behind this remake, however, have neither the imagination nor the talent to take this one to the next level; this one founders on the rocks of ineptitude and, like a beached whale, should've been cast adrift before decomposition set in. Avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't pay too much attention to the reviews and cry babies, The Fog is a slightly above average horror flick, nothing more, nothing less.The Fog might not be a cinematic masterpiece, but if you enjoy the horror franchise, there is really no reason to avoid this movie. The story line is OK, the acting is quite acceptable and some scenes offer great thrills and suspension. The movie picks up pace right at the very beginning, and doesn't let go until the end, and the story will keep you guessing right until it all unfolds.One area that could use a little touch up is the CGI, since this movie uses a lot of it, and it's far from top notch. This is however an aspect of the movie that is forgivable, and it doesn't ruin the experience.It doesn't compare well to masterpieces such as Ju-On or what have you, but it's still quite enjoyable. Everyone should just form their own opinions about this one.</fullReview>

She's funny and sincere. Great actress, she needs to choose better projects.The nature of the evil-that-lurks is inconsistent and confusing. The deaths are so unpredictable that the suspense is effectively lost. There are times that you feel that a character should really die but is saved. And, there are a lot of times that someone is just scrapped off the screen just like that. Horror flicks are usually no-brainers, but this movie is such a great big loose-ends galore that I can't help but wonder in awe at the blatant disjoints.

		<fullReview>I would give the flick a minus rating, but can't so know its worse than you could expect.Usually I enjoy finding good and poor aspects of a film, but this one doesn't. So, I can say, my dog, who had been constipated dropped a dodo, and was happy after watching only one half of this horrible attempt at a horror film.It was obvious this was a film for sex engines in their pure and teen years. The characters were young, dumb as a fence post, but quite sexy. Indeed, some of the flick, to perhaps give the viewer a break from what otherwise was a poorly scripted and acted flick better shown once on HBO than in the theater.No matter, it does have great color, nice ocean and sea scenes of the northwest. Perhaps it's a kind of poorly acted travel log? There were so many laugh ables, including the female radio light house DJ who says to her bratty kid after devils almost burning down the lighthouse, " Please son, don't go to the beach". Her son so obedient, does exactly that after being told no by mommy.Kids will love this or will they learn, do as mommy says sometimes? The stupid acting was a comic break. While seeing zombies emerge from the fog, the boy says, "I see people". The heart throb male lead, says, in a calm voice, " time to go." That's got to be the funniest understatement in this whole wasteful use of digital technology.Go see it, you'll hate it, unless your teenage sex engine needs a dose of beautiful body and dumb mind cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disaster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember John Carpenter's The Fog starting with the hook of having actor John Houseman tell a scary story to a group of kiddies around a beach fire. The narrative then proceeded to unnerve the audience with the chaos inflicted on a small town by a demonic fog that whispered down the streets of Antonio Bay (remember the nozzle popping off the gas pump and the groan of the audience when the regular started pumping onto the ground?). By the time the viewers met the principals of the story, they were hopelessly harpooned . . . and loving it! It wasn't just the fact that Carpenter had produced the fabulous Halloween just a short time before (and viewers were rooting for a repeat), it was the enjoyment of watching a fun, cheap, and brainlessly entertaining spookemup by young people who were working really hard to make a really good flick. Regardless of Carpenter's mistakes in his The Fog--not enough story for the running time and some logic flaws come to mind--you knew that Carpenter had labored mightily and produced 90 minutes of fun.Which brings us to Rupert Wainwright's remake. All the things that the original wasn't, with no story at all and even less logic thrown in.Makes me so glad I taped it off a free preview of a premium channel. It was almost like I didn't have to pay for this trash.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog (2005)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This re-telling of the 1980 horror film was given the go-ahead by John Carpenter who apparently was not completely satisfied with his original effort. The story remains pretty much the same: ~ exactly one hundred years before, a clipper ship makes its way through a thick fog and is lured towards the light of a campfire burning on the mainland. The flames of the campfire are a trick used to invite Blake and his crew to crash onto the rocks of Spivey Point; the conspirators then steal gold from the ship which they use to build the town of Antonio Bay. The plan is a success and the crew - a colony of lepers - are murdered by the conspirators. A century later, the ghostly figures rise from the depths of the ocean and, accompanied by a strange glowing fog, make their way towards the now prosperous town of Antonio Bay, seeking revenge for their deaths. The descendants of those who committed the atrocity now have one night in which to survive death at the icy hands of those who perished on the Elizabeth Dane ~ This (2005) version of 'The Fog' can be described simply as a teen-slasher flick, the director obviously keeping in-step with both re-makes like 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' (2003) and comeback slasher films such as 'Scream' and 'I Know What You Did Last Summer'. The first mistake, I think: the pace of the film is increased compared to Carpenter's - the cast seems much younger and intense, although typically moody and troubled. Indeed, the craggy and gruff-voiced Tom Atkins who played fisherman, Nick Castle, in the first film is far more convincing than the flawless Tom Welling (Smallville).A second aspect of this film that detracts from the original is evident in the revised screenplay, where the back story - the murder of Blake and his crew - has been extended considerably, resulting in much of the mystery being lost. This, and the enhanced special effects - especially the wall of fog that looks ferocious here - takes away the classic ghost story feel Carpenter achieved.Critics and fans alike should, however, not be too hard on the film. It is, for all intents and purposes, a re-make of a film twenty-five years its senior. Things change. Each subsequent generation of horror fans will always enjoy watching the classic horror films, but they will have 'their' films, the films that they will remember in time. And is there any point in making a scene-for-scene re-make of any film? Look at Psycho (1998): an excellent film, true to Hitchcock in every respect, and yet seemingly pointless.Matthew J Lee-Williams, Review.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this flick in the bargain been of the previously viewed movies at our local DVD rental. (I rarely rent, but go there for the great bargains on previously viewed DVDs.) Anyway, I figured for $5 bucks it was worth looking at. I was wrong, wrong, wrong! The only thing I can recommend this for is if you have insomnia and have run out of your Ambien. The story line is chopped up. The characters and the acting is horrible. And the effects, not being bad, have no association to whatever is happening, especially if you've never seen the original.Stick to the original! What with Adrienne Barbeau and a good plot it's the one I can recommend.YOU'VE BEEN WARNED !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incompetent film making. Remakes do not mean box office success.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't want to watch this movie on theaters or for rental because I heard horrible things about it.Last night, it aired on Cinemax and the situation led me to watch it. I mean, it was past midnight, I had nothing better to do, and it was a hard day so what the hell?Man I regret. Somewhere in the world John Carpenter is cursing at this terrible remake that forgot the good aspects of the original. The remake is horrible on every possible way. First of all, the boring plot and pace. This movie leads nowhere. Also, most scenes are non-sense and I cannot understand why they tried to make this a slasher flick when there is minimal gore and death scenes.Last and worst, this remake trashed the excellent plot and story of the original. Selma Blair was the best thing about this one in my opinion. She's sexy and her acting isn't that bad. The rest of the cast is plain bad.What else can I say? this is a failure on every single aspect. No gore, score, or even interesting situations.Avoid this that could be probably the worst remake of the new millennium.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film had atmosphere, was chilling, tense, well-directed, created high points, shocks, was eerie, had so many ingredients that make for a successful film of this genre. This new version is utterly awful, from the start to the finish. There are so many holes in the "plot" that the fabric of the film is like a net. The lead blonde girl acted like a moron and in fact came across as somewhat of an imbecile in the part she played - and I do mean that literally. The movie was agonizing to watch, even the effects were poor. I saw this on TV so thank goodness did not waste any money on it. To all involved in this pathetic effort: please stay away from movies, get another job.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A needless and unredeeming re-make of John Carpenter's 1980 vehicle for Adrienne Barbeau. A scary ghost story...well...OK. The citizens of a small seaside community is in for the scare of their lives. Payback is hell. A century after a boat sunk in the bay, a thick fog rolls into Antonio Bay. Horrible things begin to happen in spite of warnings from a visiting former resident(Maggie Grace), a dutiful weatherman(Jonathon Young)and a pretty radio DJ(Selma Blair). Ghosts of Antonio Bay's founding fathers return in the thick menacing fog seeking revenge for injustices that happened 100 years ago. A bit scary, but no great shakes. A small redemption is a brief glimpse of Grace in her 'undies'.Rounding out the cast in this supposed thriller with lack of thereof are: Kenneth Welsh, Adian Hough, Sara Botsford and Cole Heppell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of John Carpenter's The Fog is definitely not as good as the original, but it's still pretty good. The special effects are awesome and so is the make-up. The acting was pretty good. Whatever you do, don't listen to that 3.2 you'll see if you scroll above my comment a bit. DO NOT LISTEN TO THAT! This movie is at least a six out of 10. But in my opinion, it's a 7 out of 10. Definitely.The violence wasn't too bad, about a 6 out of 10 for violence, ten being gory/nasty. There was barely any drug use, except for one scene, so about a 4 out of 10 for drug use/references. The language was about a 5 out of 10. Now, the sex was a definite 7 out of 10. There was no nudity, except half a butt crack. But there was a lot of kissing and rubbing and scratching during the brief, one minute long scene of sex in the shower. I recommend not taking anyone under the age of 10 to see this movie because of the sexual scene and of the disturbing images.The Fog is a definite 7 out of 10.Original MPAA rating: PG-13: Violence, Disturbing Images, and Brief SexualityMy MPAA rating: PG-13: Some Intense Sequences of Terror/Violence, Disturbing Images, and Brief SexualityMy Canadian Rating: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Sexually Suggestive SceneMy Canadian Rating for the Unrated Version: 14A: Violence, Frightening Scenes, Sexually Suggestive Scene</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pointless Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been many unnecessary horror remakes in recent years; "Dark Water", "The Grudge", "The Ring", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills Have Eyes" all come to mind. While I can understand the trend of remaking Asian movies to overcome the language barrier, the rhetoric behind remaking American genre classics escapes me. Is there really such a dearth of originality in Hollywood? At the very least, the remakes of the "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "The Hills have Eyes" were true to their originals in tone and intent. Unfortunately, the same can not be said of this pointless waste of celluloid.John Carpenter's "The Fog" is a perfect example of how innovation and raw talent can overcome budget constraints and a rather hokey storyline. This version of The Fog completely lacks the tension, expert pacing and conviction that gained John Carpenter's original such lofty cult status. In order words, this film's biggest crime is simply that it is not scary, or tense or even remotely suspenseful. In fact, this is one of the most curiously dull horror films that I can remember watching. I can forgive just about any incompetence for the odd jolt or gory moment, but I can't believe they turned a John Carpenter film into something about as menacing as "Driving Miss Daisy".I'm really not sure who should shoulder the blame for this fiasco. The actors are fairly uninspired but they are hardly atrocious. Selma Blair does her best to give the vague impression that she gives a damn, while Tom Welling takes off his shirt regularly and Maggie Grace tries valiantly to look scared. In all likelihood, the reason for the film's failure is a combination of mundane direction and studio pressure to keep the film's rating down. John Carpenter's film is scary due to the claustrophobic atmosphere and the director's vice-like grip over the film's proceedings. Rupert Wainwright, on the other hand, directs this film like an episode of "Stargate". Everything is explained in mind numbing detail and the slow patches are covered by lame humour or by Stevie playing a song on her stupid radio program. These faults are compounded by cheap computer effects, which look more unrealistic than the ones featured in John Carpenter's film 25 year earlier.The Fog is annoying and insulting. It doesn't work as a horror film, a thriller or a drama. I'm simply not sure which audience this film is actually aimed at. If you are looking for even the mildest thrill, steer clear of this clunker. The only way you will find this scary is if you have a crippling phobia of smoke machines and bad CGI flashback sequences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another subpar remake that does not work at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some times that I really question my sanity, and where I question my status as a film-goer. I know a good film from a bad film, but even some that I know will be bad, I just give a chance anyway just to see if I like it. Of course, this works in small doses, but as a whole, it really does not. Which leads me to my thoughts on the recent remake of The Fog.Basically, the film starts with a backstory before going right into the present day of Antonio Bay, a small island town, with a tightly knit population. They have their own radio station, their own marina, and their own historical society. But soon after the introduction of our main two characters Nick and Elizabeth (Tom Welling and Maggie Grace), things begin to go a bit awry, as a giant fog begins to sweep over the town every night, causing havoc as it does.Of course, to say anymore would just ruin the lunacy of the entire plot, which I can only assume made some sort of sense when John Carpenter made it in the 1980's. I never saw the film, but going on Carpenter's early track record (as opposed to his recent one), I'll assume that he made it work, and that it truly had it's horrific moments. In 2006, it just does not wash. The story is silly, and as it goes along, it just gets worse and worse. Suspenseful sequences are down right laughable, and anything vaguely "horrific" comes to little too late, and just fails to scare the audience at all.While what happens in the story may be a slight bit zany, it's the fact that so much could have been done in order to make it better. You learn early on that many of the inhabitants of the town share the same last names as others. Yet, nothing really becomes of this important subplot. Other subplots like character's departures, or character backstories are vaguely poked at, but go nowhere later on. In some instances, other events happen later in the film that would make sense had the early mention been anything but, and unfortunately become questionable in the whole scheme of things. The movie is really not that short, I am certain that they could have at least made some of these subplots that are oft used make some sort of sense if they are going to come up more than once. If not, then they should have just cut them out altogether.Every character is a cardboard cut-out, one dimensional and all. Welling and Grace show almost no acting muscle whatsoever, and they just look awkward in their roles. But then again, Grace looks awkward in anything she does. They cannot carry the film (even with their "hot" sex scene), so they look to the not much better Selma Blair for help. While Blair delivers in small doses, her character never really moves away from the one dimensional territory vacated by the rest of the cast. Each speak their lines with little to no enthusiasm, and you really begin to wonder if they are actually acting, or are just there to pick up a paycheque. Many of the sequences are just boring because the cast has no direction as to what to do in order to make the scene work. Had a director been hired with more experience than music videos, TV movies, a Disney movie and a subpar 90s thriller, maybe there would have been some form of direction.Which brings us to the special effects. The film has some very heavy effects driven scenes, and while some of them work, others just look awful. When the fog and what it brings show up, the scenes just look half-baked. You can tell what is fake and what is not, and for a movie made during the current upswing in great special effects, it comes off as totally amateur.Carpenter may have had some sort of greatness back in 1980, but Rupert Wainwright has nothing now. Eventually Hollywood will realize this slate of remakes does not work, and until they do, we will just have to contend with more and more trash like this.2/10.(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com).</fullReview>

A dumb remake of a very good Carpentar movie. The original Fog found the book in the church and the ending was a lot better and when they changed this in the remake I was sickened out of my smart mind.

They them come back 100 years later, in a fog, and kill all the ancestors of the founding fathers of Antonio Bay.Poorly casted, poor graphics, and amazingly dump update. Tom Welling only covered the role with his good looks and charming attitude, but can't acted scared worth dodo-dodo. Selma Blair, what was her agent thinking or what was she thinking. She is better than this, even though she acted pretty well, she seemed to young to have a child and a little to hip to have a relaxed radio program.This movie should have never been remade.

		<fullReview>Every now and then, a really good horror film comes out. Halloween, A Nightmare on Elm Street, The Ring, 28 Days Later, etc. This is not a really good horror film. i did like it though, and i don't know why everyone is saying how horrible this is. i mean, i watched the unrated version, maybe that made a big difference, i don't know. Most horror films suck. thats just a fact. this one was not really scary or anything, but i didn't feel cheated out of my hour and a half like others are saying. Yes, the special effects are much more advanced than in the first, and i usually don't like a lot of CGI, but the CGI in this was pretty good i thought. they didn't over due it like in a lot of films today. yes, Tom Welling is much better looking than the original Nick Castle, yes, Selma Blair is better looking than the original Stevie, and well neither Maggie Grace or Jaime Lee Curtis do much for me, but I don't having younger, more attractive actors hurt this film. I will say it, i liked this one better than the original. people can actually do that from time to time. the original "Fog" was okay, this one was decent, which is better than okay. It was a fun movie to watch, the acting was not spectacular, but aside from just a few moments from Maggie Grace, i thought it was alright. People who love the original version of films like them for certain reasons, so when a remake comes out with better looking effects and actors and a bit of a different story, they want to hate it. but if a remake is the exact same, what the hell is the point of remaking it. if anything, more people will go back and watch the original because of seeing this one, because most people have not seen the original. I think if you just go into this film not trying to compare every detail to the original, and not expecting it to suck, and just watch it to watch and enjoy a movie, you might be pleasantly surprised, or you might think it sucks, but it certainly is no worse than 95% of the horror films that come out</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Any Better Than the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of The Fog wasn't any good either. The remake doesn't work for the same reasons. It takes more time than the film-makers have to develop the characters of the town. When they meet their various fates we don't know enough about them to care. We tend to forget who they were since they were dropped from the story till the end. Worse, the cohesion of the story is marred by the Mandatory African-American character. By his own admission, he comes from Chicago and is extraneous to the action. The time spent on his character introduces the themes of racial profiling and man's inhumanity to man. There was too much on the film-makers' plate already to take off a tangent, though I suspect the character was imposed on them. See the remake of Thirteen Ghosts if you want to another example of cohesion versus social exigency. In the case of The Fog, however, I don't think it would have been an effective film, gun pointed at their heads or not. The story of the ghosts is as dry as any in dull high school history text. A remake should be done by someone who is inspired to make the original much better. I didn't get that feeling here.</fullReview>

But my analogy of the ending might spoil it for you...The first half of this movie is just boring. The acting is bad. The script is terrible. The story and back story are weak. Even Tom Welling's amazing face and body, plus the beautiful Oregon coast can't save it.The second half is exciting. The story and back story become stronger. The effects are convincing, creepy, and scary, and begin to make sense.The ending is very disappointing however. I will use an analogy... The bases are loaded. This is the most important game for the home team in the past 100 years. All the team needs to win the World Series is for the batter up to hit a home run. Instead, his girl friend runs onto the field and kisses a guy on the other team. No home run. Game over. They live happily ever after. Doesn't make much sense, does it? And that's pretty much how this movie ends. I don't remember much of the first Fog movie. But I know that the big miracle at the end of that movie was a thousand times better than the silly, pointless, illogical end of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a waste of time. I enjoyed the original which is a classic horror film. maybe thats why I was hoping this wouldn't be a dumb horror remake to make a buck for Halloween. The acting is terrible, and its partly the scripts fault because the characters actions and reactions lack any motivation. Selma Blair is not very convincing as a radio show host. She could of put some effort in and taken a class to learn how to be a disc jockey for research. Maybe listened to the radio and heard how others use their voice properly on the radio. The superman guy is one of the lamest characters in the film(even the token black guy is better written). The blonde girl who is the dumbest lead in a film you'll see for a long time. The part with her mom was funny in how bad it was and as incoherent as the plot. The film makers went for a cheap thrill (hence the bad CGI) over mood and ruined anything that might have been good with this picture. At least the original movie you could understand the plot going on. An utter mess.</fullReview>

The problem is that overall is not very consistent, and there are times when it is not hard to get distracted.It would have been more effective had we known a little bit more about the town's citizens in order to care more about their fates. Truthfully, it is impossible to tell one from the other, and even the child doesn't earn much of our sympathy. It almost redeems itself at the very end when some of the "mystery" is revealed, and the situation is resolved.With the exception of Selma Blair, there isn't much good acting going on. She manages once again to convey at least a hint of personality to a character who is rather influential but poorly drawn.Now, with the really good... The special effects have of course, improved over the year, and there are some very good ones here. The stunt department should also be commended for their contributions to the overall effect of the film. Too bad, some of its power got lost in "the fog".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS ARE INCLUDED Okay, I've seen the original "Fog" several times since it first came out, and it never quite made sense to me. I think John Carpenter once commented that he was prevented from including all the scenes that would have explained his version - what was in the fog? Why was it there? What did it want? This version does all that and more with a modern contemporary setting, very eerie scares and a fair if not completely top-notch cast. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace do well in their first major movie. This version tells more of the story left in the background of the first movie. The ghosts of a ship called the Elizabeth Dane rise up for justice against the descendants of the men who cursed them to die. There is a bit of commentary here that history is never what we think it is but what we are told it is by the men who created it, and that the realm of the supernatural can rise up to exact justice. For once, the ghosts aren't malicious or foul creatures killing without reason. They're wanting justice for what was done to them and despite the scares by their appearances, one can really understand their plight. That there is what makes this movie better than most ghost movies of recent. However, it all goes awry in the last few minutes when Maggie Grace somehow turns out to be one of the ghosts. We see her back story, we see her family, we see her alive and yet... I am supposed to believe she is one of the ghosts. The reincarnation of one of the women on the Elizabth Dane perhaps, but not one of the ghosts. She should have a physical body somewhere. That there, is where the movie falls apart. By trying to come up with a twist ending to close the movie, the creators of the remake ruin it by going a bit too far. I'm sorry, but this version don't work....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really thought for a moment that it was just me, maybe I was just not getting into the movie. But I was relieved when I saw that here on IMDb, "The Fog" is on the bottom 100. To me, this story just made no sense and was a pathetic excuse for a remake. I was watching the making of the Fog, and the writers were like "Oh, the original had no story, we made a good story". Ha! Fools they were, I say. Oh, the remakes, the humanity! Can't Hollywood come up with something original? Just the story was ridicules and the acting was awful. The scares? Ha! There were no scares what so ever! Boring and just plain stupid, stay away from the Fog. The only thing terrifying about this film is that it should have never been made! 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Has the fog lifted? I hope so, that way I can find the exit door. I'm not going to bash this film because I know it's art and some might find it good. But, I'm unfortunately not one of those people who happened to find this movie an enjoyable thriller/horror. I'm going to be honest with you...I think this film was more like a made for TV special, if that. It had poor character development and was lacking a solid script. You get lost in a well-made movie and have to remind yourself that it's just a movie. When watching this movie I found myself wondering how this script was sold and how they attached actors to it. But, this happens more now, than it has in the past. Seems like a lot more movies are lacking strong story and character development. I know I said I wasn't going to "bash" this film...and I found myself doing this in a passive way, and for that I owe everyone I offended an apology. But, on a positive note I have to say this isn't the worst thriller/horror film I've seen and for that I'll give it 3 1/2 stars.Enjoy the movies... The Honest Critic from Seattle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scary, fun - but not perfect - horror movie that gets the job done</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked "The Fog." It's flawed but very satisfying. Why? It's not cheesy or arrogant or trying to define "the new horror." There aren't any puns or pop culture references. It's an old-fashioned ghost story that delivers the goods ? moody atmosphere, tension, big scares. That's "The Fog" in a nutshell. It won't disappoint realistic expectations.The set-up is pretty simple. Antonio Bay is one of those places where everybody knows who you are and everything you've ever done. Tom Welling is a charter captain named Nick. His character is the least flushed out, but he's shirtless four or five times, so you forgive the two-dimensionality. He's had a fling (or three) with Selma Blair's Stevie Wayne, the DJ who owns the island's radio station and broadcasts from the lighthouse all by herself. Luckily Selma Blair doesn't need anyone else to fill the space. Maggie Grace is Elizabeth, Nick's other fling who mysteriously returns to Antonio Bay only six months after leaving for Manhattan. There's also a pompous mayor, a constipated mother (Elizabeth's), a drunk priest and a Black Guy - Spooner, who completes the quartet of main characters as Nick's first mate and best friend. Spooner's played by Deray Davis, a handsome guy who deserves more screen time. But he is given a role with actual meat, more than one choice scary scene, and more to do than the expected token minority/comic relief.Something happened in Antonio Bay more than a hundred years ago. There was a fog that night and a lot of people died horribly. The ghosts have now come back (the "Why now?" is never really explained), and they are seeking revenge on the descendants of Antonio Bay's forefathers. Yes, there's something *in* the fog... about a hundred angry dead guys who can kill you in lots of different ways.The special effects are good but not great. The foreboding "wall of fog" look doesn't impress, but on a smaller scale it's strange how eerie fog can actually be, especially when its acting to isolate, and especially cause we the audience *know* there's something in there.The death scenes are unique enough and deliver excellent scares. With one notable exception (an old man follows a rope into the ocean and drowns - for no apparent reason) the body count impresses. I also like the "what you don't see is scarier" approach. The best way to explain it is to say this movie tows the line between on-screen horror (stabbing deaths, characters being lit on fire, and so on) and off-screen jump jolts.The acting isn't the best part of the movie but it's fine, people. Selma Blair and Tom Welling are actually perfect in their respective roles. Deray Davis was good, and yes has a few lines of comic relief. He and Welling make an excellent duo because they're not smarmy or annoying. They act and talk like guys act and talk. Less can be said of the relationship between Welling and Grace, who look great together (like an ad for J. Crew) but don't make a very convincing on-screen couple. There's plenty of heat but... I'm not sure it's believable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, it's a remake, so what?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the John Carpenter's "The Fog" is not so bad as its rate here in IMDb might make you think it is! What's up with you people?! Are you all against remakes or what? Is that because this one wasn't directed by John Carpenter, or is it because "a cult movie" can't ever have a remake? Of course this movie is not excellent, but it's not even close to the terrible rate it has on IMDb. In fact I think it's quite refreshing, and beyond the technical details which are obliviously better than in the original (or at least they are more recent!), this movie brought something new to the original one. It follows the main plot and a great part of scenes too, but it adds some new elements, which I personally appreciated?OK, it's also true that if the original movie had some 80's horror movies clichés, this one has some 2000's horror movies clichés too, as the whispering voices, the flashback scenes or the "see-through ghosts"? but it's OK, no problem!It's not so slowly paced as the original and I think it has a better, and more suspenseful plot. It has a different climax, because it keeps the mystery until its end, unlike the original one. The original "opens" the story right in the beginning, what makes it be just a slasher movie? In the original, there's almost no mystery, the suspense is only created by deaths and the sinister figures (and the music either?). In the remake the mystery is sustained until the end of the movie, and is created a real ghost story. The suspense is created by the mystery and the deaths. And I really appreciated the "new version" of the ghost girl?Besides, some characters were funnier and more expressive than in the original (where some characters were so monotonous/boring?). One of the better examples is the role played by Selma Blair! She definitely gave "another life" to Stevie Wayne's character! I liked this movie, and in spite of not being brilliant I think it's a very interesting one. But, just because it is a remake it deserves a 3/10 rate? Come on people, wake up! I bet with all of you that if this movie wasn't a remake (and was exactly the same movie) it would be much better rated! My vote is 7/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not So Bad...What Do You Expect?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the Fog will inevitably be compared to Carpenter's original. Nostalgia may color the perception of Carpenter's original which lacked in story and character development. Wainright's remake attempts to add more depth to the legend of Spivy Point as well as situate the main characters within a deeper relationship to what is going on.I say "attempts" because some of this enthusiasm comes through and works, but at other times it simply falls flat and leaves many events in the film hanging or appearing to be fortuitous tangents.Carpenter's original seems to be merely a montage of events in comparison to Wainright's attempt to create a larger narrative. But even so, for some reason I found the hokey effects of Carpenter's original to be more effective than the modern digital graphics. The original was more tangible while in the remake, where one wanted to encounter the "horror" of the Fog, one got vapors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The question is WHY?? Why would anyone even BOTHER remaking Carpenter's 1980 Fog-fest? It wasn't his greatest moment even back then - but hey, HALLOWEEN might have been a tad hard to top I guess? Why for that matter, would JC himself want to co-produce a watered down and quite obviously rushed version of his own film? It has lost a lot in the translation....mainly the 'spirit' of the film...as it were.The CGI of the fog rolling in might be better, but the FOG itself is less menacing and oddly, prone to laughable tidal activity. There one moment...right across town the next and clear as a bell the following scene. Some cretinous FX - such as the old lady having a bad night washing up, insults the viewer - least those who hung around in the theater long enough to see it.Inarguably from the DARKNESS FALLS and GHOST SHIP school of horror, the film is an exercise in futility. How many genuinely needy people worldwide, could the $40-50 million budget allocated to this flop, have fed? As for Smallville's favorite son, read my lips: "The guy doesn't have it" Mind you he was in equally charismatically-bereft company. Something's majorly wrong when a pair of rather sexy little panties proves to be the highlight of the movie! Is Hollywood so hard-up for original scripts they must continue to pillage (and desecrate) those from yesteryear? How long before Adam Sandler stars in a remake of THE THIRD MAN or maybe Jackie Chan can upstage Chuck Heston in the new BEN HUR (After all, look what he managed with AROUND THE WORLD IN EIGHTY DAYS) Meanwhile someone might fancy their chances remaking Carpenter's classic THE THING next..I'm sure there are people out there THAT stupid!What really irritates me. I picked this up last night in my local video store's bargain bin for $5.95. That would have gotten me a medium cheeseburger meal - with OJ!</fullReview>

The small city looks very nice. Some fog scenes was awesome. Ghosts was detailed too. If actors would be better, the movie will be much successful.Actors acted boring. They needed more oneness. Script was wroted smart and interesting, so actors would talked real, but...The end was understandable. It was kinda silly. I don't understand anything.

		<fullReview>The remake is pg-13 when the original was R. That makes a difference in horror movies. Plus the script reeks of stupid people doing stupid things. It brings the story down to a slasher type on movie, which it isn't.I won't go into the plot but instead comment on the silly scenes. Elizabeth just walks into a morgue at the hospital. Where's the security. And when others find her there, they don't question how the corpse got on the floor. Elizabeth falls into the water and gets tangled in kelp and drops the camera. Yet she never tells anyone where she lost it so it can be retrieved. Everyone tries to out run the fog in their car, yet have no problem taking back roads through the fog. Kissing a ghost, then turning into one. I never heard that before. Silly resolution of problem. Ghosts who write weird symbols in really bright red paint that make no sense.FINAL VERDICT: Bad script. I remember the original was scary, but I didn't think so much of this. This movie is only good to watch if you want to laugh at how stupid the characters are.</fullReview>

Her acting is very, um, BAD.Apart from that the story has been slightly updated, for the better. I loved the ending. It started shakily and it got boring in the middle, which is a shame because this COULD have been fantastic. It COULD have been great. But alas it isn't.It is not bad. Maggie Grace makes it not bad.

BUT, the real reason I'm intrigued with The Fog, and I hope John Carpenter is reading this :) is because when he wrote Halloween, he wrote about the boy MICHAEL MYERS....(my ex-husband's name with actual spelling!) Then John Carpenter wrote about The Fog and the original movie told of the town's anniversary date as APRIL 21 (ex-husbands birthday...!) And when Halloween first came it out it was noted that it was one of the first horror movies to really scare people since Psycho...["This film deliberately paid homage in various ways to master of suspense Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960), e.g., the character of the Nurse was named Marion Chambers, adopting the first name of the female protagonist and the last name of the sheriff, and Donald Pleasence's character Dr. Sam Loomis was named after Janet Leigh's boyfriend. In addition, Janet Leigh's daughter Jamie Lee Curtis was the lead, shrieking babysitter in peril" and both acted in The Fog....Anyway...And in Psycho...Allan Bates was not only a motel owner but also a TAXIDERMIST...remember? Well, that was my ex-husband's OCCUPATION! It still is unbelievable to me that John Carpenter used my ex's name, birthday and was linked to his occupation!</fullReview>

There was a sense that something was imminent - something scary. That doesn't seem to be the case at all with the re-make, which is soulless, not in the least bit creepy, and totally miscast. Hollywood horror movies have this fascination with young, hip people getting involved in something scary but, I'm sorry, I just couldn't believe Nick Castle as a charter boat captain or Selma Blair as Stevie Wayne (she looks like she's 21, yet has a 10-year-old son), the owner of a radio station.

		<fullReview>The Fog is set on Antonio Island, a small island of the coast of Oregon where Nick Castle (Tom Welling) works as a fisherman. His old girlfriend Elizabeth Williams (Maggie Grace) returns to the island after having moved away because of strange dreams she has been having &amp; the two get back together again, an ominous fog bank engulfs Antionio Island one night &amp; three teens are found brutally murdered on Nick's fishing boat the next day. At the same time antique objects are being found on local beaches, from pocket watches to old hair brushes. Elizabeth decides to do a bit of research &amp; discovers that the washed up items come from a sunken ship &amp; also discovers that one hundred years ago the founders of Antonio Island betrayed a ship full of lepers having promised them safe refuge but ended up stealing everything they had &amp; burning the ship &amp; everyone on it. Now the ghost's murdered lepers want revenge &amp; use the supernatural fog as a means to isolate &amp; kill the descendants of their murderers...This American French co-production was directed by Rupert Wainwright &amp; is a remake of the John Carpenter horror film of the same name The Fog (1980), personally I have no problem at all with remakes although I know some do by their very existence &amp; I was prepared to give The Fog a go despite the generally negative reviews &amp; comments. To be fair The Fog isn't a great film but at the same time it's far from the worst film out there either, Carpenter was actually a producer on this remake &amp; even he has come out &amp; said he was disappointed with the finished film &amp; you can see why. As you would expect all the adult cast from the original have been replaced by good looking teen actor's here, there's abundant use of CGI computer effects, to get a teen friendly PG rating there is zero blood or gore &amp; a fairly low intensity, there's more back-story to the ghost's here but while the fog hid the ghost's in the original here in the remake it's the fog itself that can kill &amp; seems to have a mind of it's own &amp; there's an annoying ending in which most people will be left unsure of what has actually happened although I happen to think it's an attempt at a twist reincarnation ending that just doesn't quite have the impact the makers were hoping for. I watched the Unrated version &amp; at an hour &amp; forty two minutes long The Fog is a fairly slow film, there's nothing wrong with that but it's not very engaging, the character's are faceless &amp; bland, there's little in the way of proper scares &amp; it's just not that exciting.The Fog remake goes for CGI &amp; novelty death's, here a woman is turned into a skeleton for no apparent reason, a man &amp; woman get a knife in their eye, there are CGI ghost's that look OK but the ending in which a rotting zombie Captain Blake kisses Elizabeth &amp; they both turn into happy ghost's is just off. The CGI effects aren't too bad actually, I have seen worse for sure. I still want to know who put that damned boat in the middle of the road though. There's a lot of things being set on fire in The Fog, from people in a cool scene when Dan the weatherman get burnt in close-up to boats. There's a lot of slow-motion fires too, if you want to see things burn in slow-motion then The Fog is for you. While the original The Fog was famed for it's slow pace, it's build-up, it's tension, mood &amp; atmosphere the remake is a little too glossy, sure it's well made &amp; looks nice enough but it doesn't feel real if you know what I mean.With a supposed budget of about $18,000,000 this has decent production values, filmed in British Columbia in Canada. The acting isn't great, the cast are mostly young TV actor's. Fergie of the pop band The Black Eyed Peas fame was going to play DJ Stevie Wayne but it didn't happen in the end due to contract issues.The Fog isn't a particularly good film but I found it watchable enough, the lack of any gore &amp; any sort of atmospheric mood don't help matters but for what it was I didn't mind it too much &amp; at least I saw it on TV for free.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer for this movie I had been not even close to being optimistic that this film would even come close to the original movie. John Carpenter created a masterpiece that maybe was not the best but a good film indeed. However this remake destroys every great quality of the original and tries to be a typical slasher but that is not even the worst of it. When I watched the behind the scenes look it appeared to me that director wanted to film a romantic side of the fog. He even says that he wanted to really tell Elizabeth's story, If he wants to film a romantic ghost ripoff go take a hike and make your own movie. This piece of garbage is worse than Bloodrayne a rivals Uwe Boll for the worst director of all time.The story is that on the 100th anniversary of Antonio Bay Ghosts come back for revenge on the descendants of the people that killed them or at least that was the or at least that was the original story now it flipped upside down and regurgitated Only Tom Welling and DeRay Davis are any good in the acting category.

The descendant Nick Castle owns the Castle &amp; Son, a fishing charter company, using his vessel Seagrass for tourism in the Antonio Bay. When his girlfriend Elizabeth Williams returns to the island, coincidently a huge fog appears with weird noises and killing locals. When Elizabeth slips in Nick's boathouse and falls in the sea, she finds an 1871 journal written by a man called Blake, who bought half the island for his leper people to build a town for them to live. While sailing in the clipper ship Elizabeth Dane, bringing his community to Antonio Island, Blake is betrayed by Wayne, Castle, Williams and Malone. The quartet locks Blake and his friends in the vessel, steals their money and possessions and fires the ship, killing them. In the present days, the ghosts of Blake and his crew are seeking for revenge on the descendants of the criminals.Nothing special, but does have some good acting. It has a good script and excellent beginning. Rent it or buy it.Note: This should have been Rated R.Unrated for Extreme Graphic Violence, Profanity and Sexual Situations.</fullReview>

Tom Welling is so handsome, and great to see him in something other then his television role on Smallville. It had the same suspenseful events that made the scary movie's from the 1950's so much fun to watch. The setting was believable set on an island off the coast, reminded me of Pitcairn Island. A dense fog keeps coming in and blanketing parts of the island, and when it does someone always is missing. No one knows where or why it has just started coming onto the land. Strange things are happening, no one is able to explain. It creeps into homes kind of reminded me of the Blob. People on the island are scared! The premise for the story was just so original. I was on the edge of my seat wondering what was going to happen next. I really enjoyed the film. I would watch it again. I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good scary movie but it isn't run of the mill kind. A great movie. It was definitely worth watching.

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan whatsoever of the original movie. THE FOG remake isn't NEARLY as bad as people have been making it out to be. They just bash it because it's another remake and they probably haven't even seen it! The new FOG stars Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair and if you're a fan of either of them, that's one reason to watch this remake because they all give good performances. However, there is one tiny scene that I'm going to nit-pick on and that's when **SPOILER** Tom finds his dead cousin. He doesn't show any emotion at all. **END OF SPOILER** For a PG-13 movie, I was surprised at how this got by with that rating. This movie is a DEEP PG-13 rating, meaning it's VERY close to an R! The MPAA must've just been easy on the studio. I mean we almost get a full blown out sex scene in a shower, a couple knives in the eyes, people burning to death, and shards of glass piercing someone's body. Very graphic for a PG-13 movie.The special effects are very good, but the part where the CGI is most noticeable is when that old lady is doing the dishes. (You'll easily see why if you watch the movie.) Overall, this is a good remake. Much better than "The Grudge", "Dark Water", "Darkness Falls", "They", and "Boogeyman" which have all been praised more highly than this. Worth seeing if you don't mind remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall, not bad. I am a little confused though</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the audience of the showing that I saw is any indication, this movie ranks pretty high on the screams list. Sticking with a rating of PG-13, this movie needed to rely more on plot and suspense than gore and outright profanity to give us a scare.There was one scene, however, where I was slightly confused. When Elizabeth meets the preacher in the graveyard, there's writing on the tombstone. At the end of the scene, the camera pans to the writing and shows more on the other side. Some of the writing was a Kanji that means "Wind." When I saw this, I thought that the Chinese aspect of the story was being brought in to play, but nothing else was ever mentioned about it. Anyone have any ideas?Overall, I felt this version did a better job of explaining why the ghosts had a beef with the town's folk. I enjoyed the CG effects, but was too often reminded of "Pirates of the Caribbean."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see The Fog on opening night. As with previous commenters, I, too, was excited that an updated version was being produced, with new special effects and up-to-date use of technology. And while there were some scary parts, I was left wanting more. I loved the original movie because, unlike other horror movies of the time, there was a real attempt to incorporate a plausible and coherent back story into the plot. That is why it will stand out as one of my favorite horror movies. Attention was made to keep people as real as possible and the situations believable. I found the remake took too many liberties with the story and as such had a number of holes that just never got filled and thus, the "terror" that should have been generated was awash with questions and uncertainty. "Why did *that* happen?" "When did *that* get fixed?" Those sorts of questions plagued the movie and I was then sitting wondering about the answers rather than getting engrossed in the story. Good attempt, but more attention should have been taken in the process. Thanks for reading.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was straight up terrible. The characters are ridiculous and completely predictable. "There's a scary noise coming from outside, what do I do?" go open the door of course. Ridiculous plot and terrible acting (with a script that dry and boring, I can't say I completely blame the actors for this movie's shortcomings). I had no idea how the love story developed. He began not liking her, then after nothing happened, he liked her? I knew from the beginning that this movie was going to suck because like all other crappy new horror movies, they relied too much on the ol' loud noise and something popping out to scare you, rather then suspense and actual scary scenes. I gave this movie a very generous 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I finally found a remake I completely hated. Okay, Dark Water was bad but at least it had good acting. The story and acting(from most of the characters) was beyond horrible. The dialog and script were laughable and cheesy. This movie was more of a comedy than anything. The horrible remakes and funny horror movies have to stop. That's what PARODIES are for. The directing was good, the camera angles were great, and the special effects were awesome. However, the butchery of the script, storyline, and characters outweighs all of that. The movie just leaves you with a bunch of questions and there 'end' of the movie has no resolution whatsoever. There's a rather large pothole that should be explained as to why a ghost was missing when it died alongside everyone else and how Elizabeth could look exactly like the ghost if they were completely unrelated. Unfortunately, I wouldn't even recommend you rent this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well I just got back from the remake of "the Fog"... and actually had a good time...It is more or less the same concept just not as violent as the original. I actually have more respect for it cause John Carpenter/Debra Hill was producers of it. Since the DVD of the original is only $10, I recommend it over the remake. Or if you never saw the original see this one first, then watch the original. But if you are a Carpenter fan see this to support him. Only true detractors of this is that it should have been R-rated! That is my only complaint as it was as slick as it could have been, acting was also competent so if you go into it with an open mind and try not to be too comparing between the original and remake you should have a good time.</fullReview>

If people die from touching the fog, then everyone should die that touches the fog. You can't have one person die from it and then everyone else doesn't.I did not find fault in the acting or the quality of the movie.

A small town has a huge skeleton in its closet, mainly the death of an entire ship load of people that paid for some land, but instead were robbed over every thing they owned, and then murdered.Great fog scenes. They were really believable.Surprise ending. I thought that the ancestor of one of those murdered was being shown where the treasure was, but .... that was not the case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful remake of John Carpenter's so-so original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ahhh, just what the world was missing....a naff remake of one of John Carpenter's poorer 'classics'! This totally unnecessary update of the fairly lame 80s spook movie blows on so many levels: the acting, the direction, the CGI FX, the plot-hole ridden script. I had heard a lot of bad things about The Fog before settling down to watch it and asked myself 'Could it really be that bad?'. You betcha?this movie is awful!!!Taking the original premise of Carpenter's flick?ghosts take revenge on the ancestors of their murderers?and adding several pointless plot threads that go nowhere, director Rupert Wainwright presents a lifeless mess of a film that fails to be either scary or exciting. The wooden leads (Tom Welling of Smallville fame and Maggie Grace of Lost) have obviously been selected for their looks rather than their talent and both give dreadful performances. Meanwhile, Selma Blair tries her best to emulate Adrienne Barbeau's character in the original, but her weak imitation ends up grating on the nerves.If you check the reviews of those who gave this a high rating, it appears that they either a) think Tom Welling is hot, b) think Maggie Grace or Selma Blair are hot, or c) are too young to know any better. Seasoned horror fans, on the other hand, recognise bilge when they see it.With no gore, no effective scares and no atmosphere, The Fog is a horror movie without any horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, people are right, I was so stupid to buy the DVD and it's not worth watching. I kept on watching and watching and it got boring. Normally when I buy a horror movie I can watch it a hundred times and still never get bored. If two months have passed and I watch a horror movie I would remember all the suspense and still get scared. Last two weeks I saw the 1980's Fog I found it better to watch. I first gave this movie 8 out of 10 for trying, some good effects and that they were able to draw in some good actors. But this film, what is it worth. I mean after 25 years of waiting this is what we get. A stupid, Idiotic with a capital 'I'. The director of this movie should definitely be fired. He made Tom look like a pathetic actor and what the hell is with putting in Slma Blair. Maggie is lame at acting and the movie makes Selma look lamer. When I looked carefully at The Fog(2005) The actors looked like, like idiots. Another thing, the original's ghost looked a lot scarier since they were real people in make up and the remake's one is stupid. What an embarrassment to technology and the original. The ending made me want to vomit. I mean, what was that. These people even tried to make the movie scary but the movie makers' heads were filled with bricks and mud. What was the sex scene worth in the movie. That was totally not needed. Man I loathe this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original film was pretty weak, and this one is a bad remake of it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You will know almost immediately that this movie is going to be a flop, because it opens with a trendy rock song, and anytime a horror film starts off with a KROQ song you know you're in trouble. The original film was John Carpenter's first film after Halloween and a couple of television projects, and had to have been a massive disappointment. What made someone decide to remake it is beyond me, and in retrospect, what made me decide to watch yet another goofy teenage horror remake is also distantly beyond me. Directed by the director of such gems as Stigmata, Blank Check, and various M.C. Hammer movies, the remake of The Fog makes no effort to cover up or improve upon even the most obvious weaknesses in the original film. The odd character of "Stevie Wayne," for example, remains about unwatchable, and the rest of the movie is not much better. On the other hand, I recently watched Hostel, Eli Roth's latest excrement, so this really looks like Shakespeare in comparison. It deserves its spot on the bottom 100 (although I'd have to see Hostel rated as the worst movie ever made in order to really believe in any bottom 100 list?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not as bad as everyone says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, so "The Fog 2005" is another in a long series of 21 century remakes. So its re-release is symptomatic of Hollywood's inability to crank out only one or two original ideas in a year. So its cast consists of nothing more than middle of the road teen actors, it is still not that bad of a film.The joy of Fog 2005 is that it uses current technology well. With the addition of web cams and computers as new means of adding to the tension, I was reminded of Halloween - Resurrection similar stunts. The computer animation in this is lovely and all i can say is, twenty five years of improvement in the special effects industry did wonders for the spookiness of the cinematography.The fog effects were wonderful, as were the underwater shots. In my opinion, the scene with stuff washing up on shore and the fog bank rolling in make the whole film worthwhile in my opinion.In many respects, the original's appeal lay in the presence of Jamie Lee Curtis. While her performance in the film was passable, Tom Atkins' was not. At least in this version, there is some room for believability in the chemistry between the characters. They are at least within two to three decades of one another.The only person from the original that I miss in this new one is Hal Holbrook as the priest. Adrian Hough's rendition of a priest is pathetic. His thespian abilities seem to cover the gamut of a to b.I think it worth a viewing though. Waignwrite and Hill do I nice job of fleshing out some of the story lines they were able to do in the original and I think their new scenes add to the back plots. There are also several nice scenes of the "creatures" in this version, and I have to admit, i liked the idea of some of the characters dying from rapid leprosy.While I am sorry Debra Hill had to have "The Fog 2005" as her next to last production (she passed away from cancer in 2005), the new Fog could have been worse. It could have been another "Boogeyman".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad But Not Good Either</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For starters whats with the 4 month gap between the U.S release date and the UK release date? I live in the UK and have just watched this and its ashame it wasn't released in time for Halloween in the UK but Saw 2 was good enough.If you love the last years so called horror crap 'The Grudge, Boogyman, The Skeleton Key' the odds are you're going to like this. Its not as bad as what people have said and at least deserves a 5.0 rating.It will upset a lot of fans who love the original, as the reason fans were excited about the remake is because, everyone would hope it did what the original didn't manage to do in terms of scares due to Carpenter not thinking of anything else scary to make the original an extra 20 minutes longer.Unfortuanaly the remake doesn't do this.The main fault of the film, is it was definitely made for teenagers who will think this is the scariest film ever. Some of the cast are way to young, as the makers should have realised there would have been nothing wrong with having an older cast. Although Tom Welling does't do a bad job and it nice to see him in something other than Smallville (And I'm not a Smallville fan before anyone starts). Selma Blair as Stevie Wanye just doesn't work as she has a child that looks about 12 and is way to fit to be playing a mother. Also what happened to the ghosts actually killing people with hooks, thats what made the original scary and thats why the remake fails as it just isn't scary anymore, and they also got rid of the ghosts red eyes. It was like watching the same CGI as the ghosts out of 'Pirates Of The Caribbean. The ghosts now have powers to kill people by using fire, glass and a knife this isn't The Fog the fans wanted to see in the remake. One bit in particular made me angry as the ghosts now have the power to touch people and turn them into skeletons which is just ridiculous and goes against the original. Oh and another thing you thought the makers would have used was John Carpenters scary score, seeing as he produced the remake. Thats what gave the original its suspense and tension and is really missed. Instead we're given Jameriquai to listen to in one scene.What put me off at first was a little thing called PG-13 why????? The Fog should have been made to receive an r-rating as you wanted to see some gore or some actually decent scares, but that never really happens. It will probably receive a 15 rating in the UK, but it wouldn't surprise me if it was given a 12A in the end.Also the plot of the story just doesn't really come together especially the ending, which is very weak. The main plot is there although the founders of Antonio Bay shoot the pirates instead of drowning them which doesn't seem as menacing as the original plot.The actual fog effects are quite impressive when it covers the town, and one bit especially on the beach was quite scary and actually built some tension. The acting isn't to bad and the last half an hour really picks up after a slow start. Its likely to impress the audience who haven't seen the original but doesn't even compete with the Carpenter's film.From watching The Fog is easy to understand why some remakes should not be made and this is one of them. I had really high hopes for this film as i thought it could actually be made scarier and better than the original but just doesn't even come close. Half way through I thought John Carpenter would have been better off remaking it himself as it seemed an insult to his classic.Overall go and see it its not that bad and you'll be entertained for 100 minutes. The whole feel of the film felt like it was mad by Fox as it comes down to being aimed at teenagers. I think Stevie Wanyes speech at the end sums the film up 'Why Did It Come Back'?????????</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I would be lying if I said that this film thrilled me. I was disappointed to see that there were so many things that have changed, especially the most important aspect. That aspect was the "ghost curfew". Ghosts only attacked after midnight, and they disappeared after 1h00 am. Second of all, in the original version, Elizabeth and Nick meet for the first time on the road, and it is once they get to bed that they tell each other their names, whereas in the new one they are exes?In the original, people who die on the Seagrass Boat are fishermen, in the new one they are partyers???In the original, Stevie Wayne does not know Nick Castle and she deals with ghosts all by herself, in the new one she knows Nick personally and she joins them???And please someone explain to me what was it is with Elizabeth at the end of the film! Since when has she been in cahoots with the dead!The personal journal in the beginning was hidden within the walls of a church, not in a boathouse.In the original, Elizabeth was not the daughter of the mayor, she was a hitchhiker heading towards Vancouver Canada.The new film lacked the "coldness" the first one had. In the original, John Carpenter's eerie musical score brought a chilling tone to the film. That slow paced music, mixed with the sounds of buoys afar at sea and the ocean waves really gave quite a mood to the original. Something I find was missing with the remake.In order for me to enjoy that film, I had to tell myself that I was not watching a remake of the original, but a movie that was "based" on another one. I think what also helped me enjoy that film was the fact that the story takes place in a seaside town, my kind of place to live, or at least retire in 2030 lol.Finally, as I tell people, besides the 2350 differences, both the original and the new versions of The Fog are the same lol.</fullReview>

Survivors of an leprosy outbreak make a deal with a local island to buy a large plot of land to live out the rest of their lives in peace and seclusion. The deal goes sour when the local town founders refuse them the land,take their money and burn their ship. 150 yrs later the ghosts of the dead leprosy survivors have come to take their revenge on the descendants of their original town founders.But the absolute worse part is when the leader of the ghost pack takes the local town hottie as his bride.I've seen better movies in the $3 clearance bin at the video store. poor story, weak CGI, bad actors.

		<fullReview>I saw the original 20 years ago, and so I'm a little partial to it. With that said, I will say that this was quite an enjoyable movie. For most part, it held to the core plot, with a twist at the end that took it away from the original. Was I scared by the movie? Not really, but that was probably because I knew what to expect for most part.The positives - a good ensemble cast, with the characters well picked out; an exceptionally well done set of visuals, and a decent soundtrack/score. They played with the plot enough to not make it a complete remake, while making it appeal to a younger audience of today's generation. There are plenty of today's little consumer based do-dads and gizmos to appeal to the geek in everyone! (Talk about smart product placement!)Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are decent choices for the roles they play here, and both pull of admirable performances.The negatives? Well - I can't really think of any that would make it bad. If anything, maybe the fact that I knew what to expect for most part of the movie. I didn't really care very much for Selma Blair's performance for most part though.All in all, thoroughly enjoyable, but it could have been better. It's worth 2 hours and the price of a movie ticket!

		<fullReview>Well.... I am by far the biggest fan of Tom Welling, who played the lead character Nick Castle. I was eager to see the movie and for the first 25 minutes was not disappointed, but slowly after i was bored and laughing for all the wrong reasons. The effects were okay(nothing compared to Smallville) and the acting was second rate. Besides Tom Welling and Selma Blair the acting was typically of a scary movie with the cliché "Run!" and the ever popular "What's going on?" Tom Welling however, was very good and did a great job making me believe that he was NIck Castle; boat owner and not Clark Kent; man of steel. I was a little worried that throughout the movie i would be "Why is Clark doing that and why isn't Clark.....?" Maggie Grace was a pure disgrace(no pun intended) and was awkward as the "sexy" girlfriend. Th plot was good, but i kept getting the feeling that the movie was mad in a week. It had potential but fell short.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought for sure I wouldn't like this film but, come on now, let's be honest it's a horror film about revenge. That must be the most over used theme in all of horror and yet I come back for more, never to be surprised that someone actually changed things up a little but because it's what I expect. Unfortunately, that's the sad state of things with horror nowadays.Some rather shocking (to the point of evoking laughter) bits occurred here and there but on a whole I thought I was getting just what any other contemporary horror film delivers. It was slightly prettier than Carpenter's version probably because of that thing that makes everything pretty in film- what is it again? Oh yeah, money. I can even look over a bad A story line and a flat-lined performance by Maggie Grace. It was entertaining- mostly. One word of advice, please don't try to be clever and reveal what happened 300+ years ago right when the audience gets to see special effects and creepy events. That's just called a saltpeter. That's bad directing or maybe even writing.Anyway, with all of these shortcomings I was still entertained. I wanted to hate it and was certainly walked to the edge of the cliff by the director and that actress, and yet here I am saying it was better than average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good shocks and scares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog is a nice collection of "BOO!" scares that doesn't really try to be more than it is: hot young people in trouble. While the story isn't all that mindblowing ("There's something IN the fog!!!"), it had enough shocks to keep us Premiere-crashers giddy.Tom Welling plays Tom Welling, a thick fisherman stud with blue eyes, with his buddy played by a guy who sounds like Chris Tucker Jr., who gets off all the (intentionally) funny lines.Welling's girlfriend is played by Maggie "no, the other hot girl from LOST" Grace. She enjoys showing off her underwear often, which never hurts. Maggie has returned from Manhattan to her hometown island because of terrible dreams she's been having involving drowning lepers in pirate costumes, and she needs Welling's help.Welling, however, fails to mention about the affair he's been having with MILFy (Selma Blair). Selma plays Milfy very well, and she manages to be simultaneously likable as a single-mom and lustable as a perpetually hungover DJ.Oh, yeah...the plot: It seems that The Fog (and the angry spirits that "are IN the fog!") have come to get revenge on the residents of the island for the sins of their fathers a hundred years back. That's all we really care about, right? Just establish the excuses to rack up the body count. It's obviously a PG-13 film, since there's not buckets of blood and intestines dripping everywhere. But as I said before, the numerous "BOO!" shock moments as people get stabbed, cooked and squashed are pretty nice. The real litmus test of this came 5 minutes into the screening when the projectionist messed up the sound, and they had to start the film over. So when they replayed the first scene, the audience jumped at the Teaser Big Death just as much the second time as they did the first.It was REFRESHING to see a horror film that wasn't all self-aware and meta. This is anti- Kevin Williamson. Aside from maybe one crack about Chris Tucker Jr. not waiting around to be the next one killed, there is a nice lack of self-awareness with the characters. Maybe they just don't get horror movies very often in their secluded island village, but no one ever gives the old wink/nod to the audience that they knew?that we knew?that they were acting in a horror film.It was also nice it was to see a horror/suspense film to NOT have a crazy, last second TWIST ENDING that causes the audience to grumble to themselves as they shuffle out. I'm not spoiling anything by saying that. The film is nice and scary right up until the end, but they managed to resist the temptation to go for a silly M. Night Shyamalan ending. In the end, it was a good time for a teenage Halloween film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fog, The (2005) 1/2 (out of 4) Incredibly poor remake of John Carpenter's classic 1980 film is among the worst remakes I've ever seen. I'm all for remakes whenever they try something fresh and original and for the most part I haven't been too disappointed but that's not the case here. I was actually pretty excited when I heard they were going to remake this film because there were a lot of great ideas they could have used to tell a new story but none of that takes place here. Carpenter produced this version and has said he did it for the money, which appears to have been everyone's motive here because not a slice of talent can be seen. Poor special effects, bad acting, bad screenplay and direction that never knows where it wants to go. Carpenter's classic will live on while this thing here sinks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the horrific reviews??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe it's because I had just watched Batman Begins (don't EVEN go there) and the House of Wax remake that I found this movie quite good. In comparison, it was quite enjoyable to watch. I wasn't bored, found myself scared in the appropriate places and followed the story quite find. Yes, there were some bad plot points, little things that happened and no one called anyone on it, but it was a horror movie, and I rarely expect continuity and for things to make the best sense. I liked the casting, and the ending worked out very well for my feeling about Maggie Grace as an actress. Tom Welling made a very nice leading man, attractive, compassionate and believable. The set was agreeable, nice lighting and color. I went to the movies to take the bad taste of the two aforementioned movies out of my mind and to have a couple hours of mindless entertainment. This movie filled the bill quite nicely. I'm sure it will become one of those movies that I watch every time it is on HBO or Showtime!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I honestly cant understand why this film has got such bad reviews. i haven't seen the remake and i can see that there are a few unrealistic reactions or things the characters do or don't do. i wasn't scared at all but i still really enjoyed this film. i thought it was well made,the acting was fair, the film needs to decide if its a silly 'kill the dumb teenagers' movie or a horror/fantasy masterpiece and still maybe needed some more work. however, it was entertaining, the effects were brilliant the whole look of the film and the production design made it look very dark and creepy, it was what i like to see: a horror which is more along the lines of fantasy ghost story rather than another pointless slasher. i recommend it for the people who like a softer type of horror rather than the gore lovers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Oh yes, this movie is a very strong contender for winning the questionable award of "Absolute Most Pointless Horror Remake" and that's saying a lot, especially with other competitors like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" and "When a Stranger Calls". Back in 1980, "The Fog" was one of John Carpenter's lesser praised but unquestionably amazing low-budget horror achievements, as it benefited from a terrifying atmosphere and a straightforward script. Rupert Wainwright added or removed pretty much nothing from Carpenter's original script (apart from some unimportant details) and yet he managed to get rid of ALL the scary elements! How the hell did he do that? Well, presumably because our inexperienced Mr. Wainwright exclusively focused on the CGI-effects and hi-tech visual eye candy, and therefore completely neglected everything that involves the drawing of the characters, the build-up of tension and atmosphere and a plausible story-structure. The characters are running around the sets like headless chickens, not really knowing what to do or say. The whole point of the movie is the anniversary-celebration of Antonio Bay's founding, yet we get to know NOTHING about the town itself and only a very limited number of inhabitants are introduced. Even the personalities and relationships between the main characters remain pretty vague at all times. How are you supposed to care about these people's fades when you never get to know them? Personally, I truly &amp; honestly cared about Jamie Lee Curtis, Adrienne Barbeau and Tom Atkins in the original version of "The Fog", because they were sympathetic and properly introduced characters. Well...then at least the special effect are great, right? No, they're not. In fact, the fog-effects and especially the undead monsters that home inside it are some of the most embarrassingly inept digital creations I ever saw. They provoke feelings of pity instead of fright. There's no gore and the acting performances are disastrous. So far, I only described 10% of all that is wrong with "The Fog", but wasting any more time on this turkey would be just as stupid as watching it again. Avoid!</fullReview>

It was Scary in parts. It is worth seeing. I have seen awful movies. This film is not a bad film like Tomb Raider or Weekend at Bernie's. I would rate the film a 7 or 6 out of 10. I would give a 3.9 for the latter two, but not the Fog. A different kind of story for current horror/suspense movies. The week point for the film is the unfolding of the ending. Wasn't the original set in Maine? I like the fact that the movies are giving an explanation to why it is happening. This explanation concept was also used in the New Amityville movie.</fullReview>

I still don't understand what the ending was and thats pretty bad. i would highly recommend you to keep your money because you'll wish later you spent it on something else. 4.5 out of 10 and thats being nice. i went with a bunch of my buddies and known of them understood this movie you will get more satisfaction for your money with about any other movie in theatres. Also everything that happens in this movie is so predictable. The acting was absolutely horrible. Go see Emily Rose its 1000 times better than this load of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the Fog at a matinée today. There were about 14 people in the theater to start with. Even before the movie was over there were only about 4 of us left, including my friend and I. Yes, that is how bad this movie is. The film was a little scary at times but became increasing less so, it was slightly comedic in how bad it was. In one scene, a character was in a room/morgue looking at the dead bodies (the "Fog"'s victims), this character was not a coroner, a police officer, nor a detective; it was so unrealistic that this character would have such easy access to that room when there was a murder investigation going on! The plot was boring, predictable, the acting OK (barely) but not great; if my friend didn't have to see the entire film so he could review it, we would have left earlier also. Save your money and don't see this, it is not worth a dime or a minute of your time.</fullReview>

I think it would have been better if you had the ghost of Maggie grace's alter ego, given back to the ghouls and Maggie grace being still alive and back to tom welling, that would have been more believable!

		<fullReview>Not a movie for every one I agree. Some people might get disappointed by the "The Fog" 2005 edition as it most of the time is a surprisingly quiet and absolutely not scary horror movie. But if you watch as a poetic ghost movie and pay attention to the pictures and the scenery it is one of the most visually beautiful movies of the decade. And as things at last heat up also quite entertaining.John Carpenters version is far more scary and crude (and funny). Even though the two versions are using the same plot they are really not fitted to be compared to each other as they are using completely different languages to tell the story. If you liked "Stigmata"- go watch the new edition. If you didn't, you'll probably be better of with the old.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst remake of 2005</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has got to be the crappiest remake of 2005. I really can't believe I paid full price for this movie.Apparently, in the remake they thought that the audience wouldn't understand how a boat load of lepers got screwed over by the founding fathers and had all their valuables taken, so instead they intertwine this complete crap ass back story because the modern day audience is considered to stupid to figure it out from the explanations of a drunken priest and a recently discovered journal. Then to entice pubescent boys &amp; girls they decide to throw in a completely useless shower scene, nothing was shown except for Tom's nipple, which being a straight male is not really my thing. The biggest kick to the head was the lame ass idea to change the purpose of that attack from greed to 'lost love'. Let me point out something about how stupid this part is, just in case you're not getting it, they both died at the same time! Why/How the hell would Elizabeth be separated? The movie just f/ckin blew, worst of the year that I've seen, things just didn't make sense, and characters were next to useless, why did they show the fisherman get leprosy, while no one else was infected? Why the hell did the fisherman show up at the car wreck? He was just plain stupid! Then you have the lamest token black character EVER in a movie! Did they not get the hint while watching South Park that the "Token Black" character is played out? It was almost like the Producer one day said "you know what this movie needs, a funny black guy, kids love that these days!". The Priest was another useless character, in the original he was the one that explained everything, he was more of a functional drunk, in this one, and he was just sitting around waiting to be killed? LAME.On a final note: what the hell was the purpose of the burning vehicles? They weren't in accidents, they just where curbed parked and on fire? STUPID! Be warned, I never try to tell a person NOT to see a movie, but I will say "DON"T PAY FOR A MOVIE TICKET ON THIS ONE!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazing classic gone HORRIBLY WRONG!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, in very short form, Mr. Carpenter, the creator of "The Fog" (1980) should hunt down Rupert Wainwright and beat him until he can't think anymore, just so he doesn't murder any other amazing classic movies. I have never been more disappointed in a movie in my entire life! I strongly urge everyone to go and rent the ORIGINAL "The Fog" by John Carpenter and enjoy how a true director does things. Wainwright is nothing but a wanna-be, knock-off and should quit now.For those of you who were totally confused, thought the computer generated imagery, the 'ghosts' in the movie, and everything else sucked... I'm right with ya! Not only didn't Wainwright follow the plot of the movie... but his own version was horrible, erratic, and made no sense! You couldn't side with a character because there was no character development; you couldn't understand the plot because it was to shallow to wade through and really grasp; you couldn't get scared because of all the corny cliché's that Wainwright wrote in. Can a movie get any worse than this? I think not! We live in the year 2005 - a time when George Lucas shows us the power of computer generated imagery (and amazingly so), when Quentin Tarantino shows us how to develop a story, characters, and show us how are SHOULD be in films (i.e. Kill Bill Vol. 1 &amp; 2 and Sin City just to name a few), and a time period when we can look at classic and present horror films and not only understand them but use their astounding techniques to make a great film (using George A. Romeo, John Carpenter, and even Rob Zombie). Then we turn around and ask, why with all of this background out there, with so much to learn from, understand, and put forth does a man put out such filth... such fecal trash as this?! Simply because Rupert Wainwright is a horrible director...So in conclusion (for now at least), I DO NOT recommend this movie, but I do recommend seeing John Carpenter's ORIGINAL film "the Fog"... don't let a cheap knock-off kill such a great movie! Boycott Wainwrights cheap-ass movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!!1</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been years and years since I've seen the original so I really do not remember it! Hmmm. No matter, I wanted to see this movie and view it with an open mind as I do all movies. For some strange reason, I like to see what comments people have posted about a movie before I watch it and IMDb has the best posts. To me, they're useful and it's fun to read what different people have to say about the movie I'm about to rent. I've already made up my mind as to whether I'm going to see a certain movie or not and reading the user comments will not defer me from see that movie. I read the comments, watch the movie and then make up my own mind. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. Tom Welling did a good job. For the first couple of minutes into the movie I expected to see Lana or Chloe sipping coffee at The Talon or something like that. It took just about two minutes of Tom's character in this movie to tear me away from that. Smallville is the only place that I've seen him act and he did a marvelous job of showing me that he's not just Clark Kent. He made the movie for me and to me, ladies and gentlemen, he proved himself to the world that he's now a proved actor who can stand on his own merits. All that just to say that I really enjoyed eating popcorn, turning the lights down low and just watching a really great movie unfold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what people generally expect from a horror movie, but they should definitely not watch it as an Oscar candidate, but as a scary movie that can keep you in your seat and make you wonder. I've seen a lot of bad horror movies (maybe no that many, cause I am not to thrilled of spending hours and hours on junk movies), and I can certainly state that this wasn't one of them.You should give some credit to the young actors from this movie. I mean, come on! It is the first movie where I see Tom Welling in another role than Superman and he doesn't look that bad, although I kind of imagined him getting rid of the ghosts with some super powers. Not to mention Maggie Grace, whom I only seen in "Lost" and she seems also convincing. They are all growing into mature actors and they tried to do a good job with this movie too. Maybe the script wasn't that great, or some of the other actors in the background weren't that convincing, but the lead actors weren't that bad and the special effects were cool enough.Don't try to see the movie hunting for mistakes or flows, try to keep an open mind and observe the good aspects of the film, you will notice that it is good enough to waste a little time in a sleepy evening.To Tom and Maggie: you did good, keep it up and let us see some more good stuff from you, you have real potential as actors. Good luck with your future films!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The one good thing that I can say about this movie is that the CG was pretty good. Aside from that, the plot stinks, has holes so large that I'm surprised that the characters didn't fall into them, and every event that can be considered remotely frightening, is preceded by a telltale change in the score. The main flaw in the plot is that it has a conflict and a resolution, but they don't fit together (unfortunatly, explaining this would give away the entire movie). In addition, the fog cannot decide who it is after. Any way, I thought it was crap, but the row of middle school boys sitting in front of me, thought it was "the best things since the Ring." I'll leave it up to you to decide how great a film it is, but you may want to rent it, rather than paying for a movie ticket.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake of John Carpenter's classic "The Fog" was just like I feared it would be, merely OK bordering on rotten. The original is still the better film by far. Blake &amp; company looked good but, a little too much like leftovers from "Pirates of the Caribbean." And I didn't care much for (i.e sucked) the following: the method of the betrayal of the crew, the "Sea Grass's" encounter with the "Elizabeth Dane" (not nearly as cool or nasty), and the absurd "twist" ending. Plus I missed John Houseman's atmospheric story telling in the very beginning that so effectively set up the original film. (SPOILER ALERT) Also, too much death by fire for my tastes. And the death of the old lady that was babysitting that DJ's son was THE MOST stupid cinematic death in recent memory-no lie! I found it bordering on shocking that both John Carpenter &amp; Debra Hill had executive producer credit on this turkey? I give "The Fog" remake a 4/10. Maybe someone needs to remind all these remake happy freaks in Hollyweird that sometimes less is more &amp; CGI isn't god. That golden rule is why Carpenter's original is considered a classic &amp; the remake will rightfully be relegated to the attic of forgotten films. Oh one more thing, I was running real late for the 12 noon showing (one other person in the entire theater besides me) so I stayed also for the 2:30pm showing (to catch what I missed previous) and maybe 6 besides me attended. NOT a good sign folks!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of John Carpenter's films, The Fog being one of my favorites. So after the Assault on Precinct 13 debacle, I was a bit leery of this remake. But after seeing Debra Hill and Carpenter's names on this film, I went in with an open mind.I was pleased with what I saw. The soundtrack is updated, the cast is much easier on the eyes, but the story (with a few minor details changed) is remarkably the same. And once the film gets going, Carpenter's creepy and suspenseful piano music ties you to the original while the updated fog effects modernize the film. And yet the style of suspense and scares are the same brand, without resorting to buckets of gore.There are always going to be those who will automatically bash a remake without seeing it and occasionally I'm one of them. And to be certain, many of them are pretty crappy. The Fog (2005) isn't one of them.-Mikey</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The New Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I finished off my last messenger run (I'm a runner - but won't be forever) to Sony Pictures on Tuesday night and followed a trail of signs that said "special event". Now my policy in these situations is to keep going until I get stopped and in this case no one stopped me until I had found my seat in a packed screening room. SCORE! I had no idea this was an advance screening of "The Fog" remake until the director and team got up to introduce the film. Yes! Aside from the aborted start (sound wasn't working properly at first) I enjoyed a lot about my uninvited preview experience. I'm a huge fan of the original and I will say this was a big departure. The cast is much younger, and it's got a much more "hip" feel to the overall presentation. The score and the songs absolutely rock, I'm definitely buying the soundtrack. The scares were there but at Pg-13 levels (i.e. you might see a knife to the eye but you won't see the blood). The best parts of the film were undoubtedly the flashbacks to what happened on the Elizabeth Dane. John Carpenter's original Fog only gave us dialog and we never actually got to see how it all played out, who screwed over whom and how. I won't hit any spoilers but it's the best stuff in the flick, smartly constructed and seriously creepy. The biggest flaws for me were in what I chocked up to shoddy directing. The TV actors look great (Maggie Grace in underwear and the seriously hot young Superman Tom Welling) and both had high performance points which tells you they CAN act. However other moments they either delivered lines flatly or inappropriately. Simple holes in logic could have been subtly justified with clever inserts or better coverage but were simply not. Some of the staging was noticeably flat i.e. ***MINOR SPOILER*** what could have been a cool scene and big scare was when Father Malone steps to a car window to startle Nick and Elizabeth. Instead of a camera move up and POW the Father being in frame, instead you see this dude jump into frame who you see coming all way from Cleveland. He then proceeds to scream out his lines which should undoubtedly have been more understated. ***END*** Details like this and half a dozen others prevent the movie from being great. Maybe this is why the director has been on the sidelines for six years (the forgettable Stigmata being his prior effort). All that ranting aside, The Fog delivers a solid PG-13 scare experience with a shocker of an ending, even if it comes from the vicinity of nowheres-ville. I'm going to drop the eight or nine bucks to see it again this weekend as I think there may have been more clues to the ending than I might have caught. All in all this new hi-tech Fog has its flaws but its a LOT of fun and is a definite recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that Maggie Grace is most wonderful in The Fog, It's a great movie. You should see it the best ever i thought it was going to be a Bore but hell was i wrong, I was scared out of my seat i love horror movies but this was the best. I hope she will continue on the great path he is leading. Her hot co-star is great too but i was on the Maggie Grace side. She is wonderful actress, She was also in the Show LOST I can't believe it that she got cut-off. She was excellent. The director should deserve and Oscar Nod. But if that doest happen she will blow us out of our minds. I hope she's at the Oscars tomorrow. Like i said she deserves A lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gone is Carpenter's magic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all: What the hell's up with all those ravingly bad reviews for THE FOG (2005)? It's like there's a trend or a hype going on which has people, incapable to form an opinion of their own, jumping on the band-wagon out to bash this movie. I've read comments of people stating that they LOVE the original but HATE the remake because the story sucks. That's what I call contradicting yourself, boys &amp; girls, because, face it, the story hasn't been changed a bit (they only ADDED certain elements). And some commentators keep on nagging about continuity-errors. I admit, it doesn't speak in favor of the movie when you can easily spot them, but EVERY movie has continuity-errors, even the "Critically Acclaimed"-ones. So stop friggin' moaning about it. I've read some more things that shocked me, but I'm here to talk about the movie, so I'm gonna leave it at that.Second: Yes, I was fairly disappointed when I saw this remake, and yes, I didn't think it was very good. But it still is a slightly above average horror-film (for teenagers, I shall add, considering the PG-13 label), no matter what's being said. Those of you who disagree with me clearly haven't watched any direct-to-DVD flicks lately. So, here are some of my thoughts after seeing THE FOG (2005).It looks like Hollywood has run out of creative writers and fresh ideas when it comes to the horror-genre. If it's not successful Japanese horror-movies they're recycling, then they're constantly spawning remakes of various (semi-)legendary classics(?). THE FOG is the newest addition to the ongoing list of remakes. And it won't be the last, because remakes of Wes Craven's THE HILLS HAVE EYES and David Cronenberg's THE FLY (another remake of a remake?!) are coming our way.Now, the original concept of a fog carrying an ancient evil which threatens the population of Antonio Bay isn't too bad and was even kinda original in 1980 when John Carpenter's THE FOG came out. So the story remains the same and some scenes even stay (respectfully?) true to the original. However, the writers added some completely unnecessary elements which bring down the narrative level of the movie. For example, there are flashbacks of the victims of the ancient crime showing them in their original human form. Maybe that's not totally unacceptable but the completely redundant love-interest of über-ghost Blake certainly is.In further comparison with the original, there's a lot more wrong with this remake. John Carpenter's dark and eerie soundtrack added a lot to the foreboding atmosphere of the original. Now the soundtrack is un-inspired. To make it worse, radio-dj Stevie Wayne throws in these dull rock-tunes and cheap RnB/hiphop once in a while. Now that's something THE FOG did NOT need on it's soundtrack. The fog itself and the over-all look of the film is completely different. In 1980, in some shots, the fog had this mesmerizing glow and Carpenter often used Argento-like colors in the cinematography. Now, everything looks grey. To me, this re-styling was okay. The zombie-look of the ghosts is traded for a more transparent CGI-look and their modus operandi differs from the 80's hack &amp; slash-routine, making the threat less tangible but more unpredictable in a way.The acting was just mediocre. The producers clearly casted Tom"Smallville"Welling and Maggie"Lost"Grace to trick some of the younger viewers, unfamiliar with the original, into seeing THE FOG. Why the joking black guy was inserted in the plot is completely beyond me. He wasn't even from Antonio bay. And Selma Blair...? Well, she's good-looking as always, but she hasn't got much to do really.Is THE FOG a good remake? Only partly. Staying true to the original story (apart from the additional elements) is one thing, but this movie proves that a bigger budget doesn't necessarily mean a better movie. Is THE FOG a good horror-movie? Not really. It's just not scary enough, some of the jump-scenes don't work at all (some do, however) and there's almost no gory stuff in it.Only thing that saves this film is the consequently executed visual atmosphere and the fact that there's just enough going on to keep you from falling asleep. The special effects and set design were okay, but that's due to the bigger budget. Chances are that after viewing this remake, you'll go running home and watch Carpenter's version all over again. At least I did.I was planning on giving THE FOG (2005) maybe 5 or 6 out of 10 stars because it was only so-so. But instead I'm gonna give it 10 out of 10 for two reasons only: to boost up the voting here on IMDb (you people commenting on it are just too harsh!), and to honour the late Debra Hill.Goodnight to y'all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but very entertaining. The story was quite enjoyable. I liked the cinematography. It was eye pleasing. I found the characters to be likable, the relationships were interesting, and the history of the town -- fascinating. I am truly looking forward to the release of the DVD later this month so that I can watch it again. Then maybe I will have something more to say about this remake of another movie by the same name. I did find some of the special effects to be strange, and left unexplained, but I do not really need to know the reason for every little thing that happened. It was enough that they did. I need to see a movie more than once, and usually do not even go to the theater. But I had to go see this one. And it was worth the time in the theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK ... I have always been a fan of the original version and until recently I thought I was the only one. However it was hardly one of the scariest of all time and I felt the back-story was a bit neglected (we would have hardly gotten any of it at all had it not been for the opener that only got shot because the film was too short).I suppose the people who hated this one were expecting more from the present day story? No. Been there, done that, this film was all about going back and correcting the neglected back story and bringing it up-to-date so that a younger crowd could appreciate the actors and actresses they want to see.The original was just not that great... it had a fantastic cast, but it was not quite done right. This time the story was done right, but with a lesser cast.I rate BOTH of them with a 9 out of 10 and I will be adding this one to my DVD collection right next to my DVD of the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter what other people so this movie was pretty good. The story was interesting and the special effects were cool. Tom Welling and Maggie Grace are good at making you care for the characters. It was some of the most fun I've had this summer. This movie also had a good twist at the ending. Even the fog looked real. I have seen the original movie The Fog and I like this one better. It was more entertaining, exciting and had a better story than the original one. I'm not saying the original one wasn't good but this version was better. This movie was one of the best horror movies that have come out in the last year or so.

You will often catch yourself saying, "Haha, he's gonna die." All the horror movie clichés were present.You were saying to yourself, "I know that dead guy is going to get up, but when? The ending was kinda lame. It almost made me angry when she walked back towards the ghosts, then kissed one. WTF!!! Very predictable, but very entertaining.

		<fullReview>The Fog, in my opinion was very good. The special effects were very good. It had many "pop-outs" which mad the audience (which consisted of half my grade) scream. Tom Welling, Maggie Grace, and Selma Blair were very good as the main roles. Mary Black, DeRay Davis, and Sonja Bennett were also good as smaller roles. The whole "atmospere" of the fog was very scary. I wouldn't worry about the gore factor, because I don't remember much blood at all. If you like zombies, stabbings, car crashes, windows breaking,and and a mysterious fog, this if a good movie for you to go see. The deaths and fright may seem lame at first, but your in for a frightening good time, as the movie picks up it's pace, and becomes even more frightening.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I really liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see The Fog last night. My brother was a crew member on the movie and dragged me along. I really never had any urge to see this movie, the trailer seemed scary, but that kind of thing doesn't really interest me. I didn't realize it was based on an original movie, so the idea that there's a fog that kills people seemed so stupid. Anyway, I went to this screening last night and was definitely surprised by the movie. I didn't know who half the actors were, which usually makes me think twice about a movie, but I recognized Tom Welling! Yes, I'm a fan of Smallville and yes, I have a school-girl crush on him. Must stop hyperventilating...I am not a great judge of movies like this, but the special effects were really good. I mean, the fog itself was creepy and the "things" that you've seen on the poster and trailer were really well-done. I thought that the music used in this movie was great, although I gotta say; I got really annoyed when I screamed after EVERY loud noise! Every time the fog rolled in, a loud banging would sound ? like someone (or something) was banging on the door ? and I jumped every time. That definitely got annoying. The movie was so loud that I never felt comfortable relaxing in any scene. Scary...but it got a little old.The thing I was most surprised about was how smart this movie was. I always think of these supernatural, sci-fi, horror movies to be mindless scares with even dumber characters. But The Fog definitely uses this subplot of a pirate ship that builds until the end to explain a lot of the mystery and confusion that surrounds everything. I really thought that certain scenes were really well-done, especially with the use of the fog, specifically with the Selma Blair-car stalling scene and this intense part with the little kid (Selma Blair's kid, yeah right) in the movie. Anyway, walking out of this film I was definitely surprised by how much I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the movie was so bad as war_cat proclaims it to be, then why was it the number one movie on its opening weekend in October 2005? The reason is that it was a great movie. The acting by Tom Welling was just excellent. The special effects they used for the film were spectacular also. The way the fog poured in everywhere was amazing, it is really creepy. The storyline is much better than what some people will have you believe. The way the ending played out will shock you, in a way you never thought was even possible. I won't go into details, because everyone who likes a good haunt deserves to see it for themselves. An amazing movie, which deserves 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's pretty lame. It's not bad, just lame. This movie should have been called The Smoke Machine. It's exactly what you expect. First, an "ancient evil" is unearthed from the ocean floor. Then all the birds on the island fly away, and a dog is found dead. If those aren't enough horror clichés for you, it gets better. There's a group of horny teenagers partying and drinking on a boat. They're the first to die (inevitably). Soon after, there's the requisite ass-shot of the hot girl walking around in her underwear. The Fog is primarily a check-list of lame horror clichés, one after another.And did I mention that Selma Blair plays a single mom? Yeah right! That's as believable as Tara Reid playing the scientist in Alone in the Dark! Oh, and there's a priest, Father Malone, but he's not very godly at all. He's always drinking and yelling ? not a convincing priest at all. On the surface, there's really nothing to The Fog, but if I really rack my brain, I'm sure I can find some deeper moral message about colonialism and violence. But why would I want to do that?</fullReview>

Tom welling especially was a novelty to watch. Although this movie was not the 'horror' film i had expected when i went to see it, it was still very suspenseful and enjoyable.Don't go see it if you are expecting it to be bad, because then it most likely will to you.

This movie wasn't amazing, i wouldn't see it 2 times but yea i guess i could see myself renting it in the future.

		<fullReview>This is exactly the kind of movie Ocotber needs. It's full of horror bells and whistles. It's got good performances from actors and actresses who are entertaining even between the frightening scenes. The plot is reasonable. All you have to do is belief in ghosts. It's not the fog itself that kills people, it's the pirates who are using it to return from the sea. I'm not sure I understand what happens in the end (there is no explanation for what happens to one person) but it is different, so it keeps you from asking too many hard questions.The movie doesn't rely exclusively on loud noises to get you to jump, but there are plenty of those. There is also the kind of tension in this movie that you see in The Others and the Grudge, where you know the bad is eventually coming but you scare yourself waiting for it. Most of the cool scenes were in the second part of the movie but there's one scene (on a boat) that scared the bejesus out of me. It was really cool because everyone on the boat dies in a different way.So it's like a B. If you want to know my taste I give the Grudge an A, Dark Water is a C, Saw is a D and Emily Rose is an F! On that list the Fog is closest to the Grudge except the story doesn't jump all over. It's a great date movie girls, or good to see with a lot of friends if you like to be freaked out in large numbers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I was very surprised by the remake of The Fog. The same storyline still applies; a small town is engulfed by a thick fog containing ghosts from a ship wreck 100 years ago. I have to add that this remake has a more in-depth storyline to it which makes the movie even creepier.I was surprised by the acting as well. Tom Welling is a likable character along with Maggie Grace who really steels the show. Selma Blair was also another great character, although she wasn't in it as much as you think.The effects were 100% NOT cheesy and very awesome. You would think killer fog would be so stupid but it was done very well in this remake. Without spoiling anything, I can say I really enjoyed the ending and it was done very well. There's also a bunch of pop out scares which is always fun when your in a dark theater.What can I say? After a year of some terrible horror movies, The fog remake is just a fun scary movie that will you keep interested if you let it. 10/10</fullReview>

The only character I cared about was the weather man, but it is a small part. In the original, Adrienne Barbeau, and her character of the night DJ were memorable.I am not sure it was a good idea to show more of the doomed lepers either. The original movie was less explicit.To sum up, the new Fog looks good, but in all other respects, it's not a remake, it's a Xerox of a Xerox.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing! Chock Full Of Clichés &amp; Coincidences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was going into this film with high hopes, but was really disappointed with the lazy story writing that was chock full of clichés and coincidences. Worse yet, the way the plot was written, things could only happen the way it happened if everyone acted like an idiot.Things that I disliked in the movie include: 1. Characters that did stupid things like Elizabeth going outside in the middle of night in her underwear to check on a scary noise AFTER she has already seen the creepy watery footprints on the ceiling and heard the banging on the door.2. Coincidences that just happen like a Stevie just happening to run into Nick, Elizabeth, and her son, just as the right minute or Elizabeth just happening to find the secret location of the book that explains everything in the boat house. That was really lame.4. Overused clichés like having a priest around who tells people to get out while they still can, a kid in peril who says in a knowing way some variation of "They're here...", characters who refuse to get out while they still can (like the dude who didn't want to leave so he could get his dogs), a bunch of partying kids (including the requisite slutty girls) who gets killed first, lots of jump scenes where people are tapped from behind only for it to turn out to be their boyfriend, etc.5. Inconsistencies like the window in the back of the pick-up getting blown out in one scene and then being perfect again later on as if nothing had happened.6. Story loopholes like the suggestion that Elizabeth's character was a reincarnation or descendant of one of the victims from the boat in the back story, but if that woman drowned to death, how could Elizabeth be descended from her? On the plus side, the ghosts looked creepy enough and the back story evil enough to warrant some type of karmic retribution, but other things were cheesy and silly like people's bodies getting flung across the room or the ghosts saying things like, "blood for blood".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I would have to say this is the worst movie ever made. Not only was it incredibly long, and pointless, but also filled with the most plot holes I have ever seen in a movie. as the movie first begun, i found the crowd staring at the screen in awe. Some kids were crying, due to the "intense" death of the kids partying on the boat. (which, i might add, was the worst special effects i have ever seen). as the movie progressed, there were parts where the theater burst out in laughter at this movies shear stupidness. There is a part where a woman is doing dishes, and the fog wipes over the house, and a decaying hand pops out of the drain, breaks the plates she is washing, and grabs her. Then her entire body just rots and lays there on the ground. Words cannot describe how horrible this movie is. I walked out saying to my friends "I think id have to jump off a building and die if i was on of the actors in this movie, my career would be ruined." Sitting outside the theater waiting for our ride home, i talked to numerous people, some being total strangers, warning them not to waste their money going to see such a horrible movie.</fullReview>

Another huge upset is the butchering of the Stevie Wayne character, and her role in the storyline. Selma Blair was a wonderful choice for the role, however completely given nothing to work with. Not only did most of the characters lose their identities but so did "THE FOG". Again, we would have expected that updated special effects would have added to the tension and horror that the fog brings as it rolls in. Again...sadly...It did Not!Having nothing at all nice to say I will just end it here!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing I can say about this remake is, I LIKE IT! The only star I remember is Tom Welling from "Smallville". Unlike the 1980 version of "The Fog" that had star appeal. The remake had sex appeal. The real scary part about the movie is the fog itself. It's just as scary as the original, only without all that gore. The scare factor was not lost in this movie. The excitement factor was there as well. It's OK for people to express their opinions about this one and the original. The descendants of the founding fathers of Antonio Bay lived with the guilt for a long time and unlike the original, they had a resident named Spooner(DeRay Davis) who said his fathers from Chicago, at least he was the innocent ones in that town. After finding the inaccuracies in the memorial, it really didn't matter. Lies and shame plagued the town and the people knew it. Elizabeth(Maggie Grace) was the only sacrifice who went with the dead, while everyone else, paid for their shame in the past. This version show they got avenged, despite some of the changes the ending had in-between feelings. All I cared is that the spirits will finally rest. How you feel about it is up to you! Beware of the spirits, this movie is more mystifying than the latter. Rating 3 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

The latest version has some good scenes in it as well and some good acting by Smallvilles Tom Welling. Maggie Grace from Lost was horrible in it and she just got on my nerves when she was in the movie. The story doesn't completely copy the original because it ends different but then again the story could have been better and the things in the Fog should have remained corpses and not come back to Antonio Bay as some kind of spirits. What i would have liked to have seen in this movie was some blood and i know you don't need blood to scare people but it does help the affect of the movie and another let down in this movie was that there was some cgi fog that got annoying at times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie wasn't horrible but it was lacking something. The fog it's self wasn't scary to me at all although I did like the way the ghosts were done. Selma Blair has nothing on Adrienne Barbeau's sexy voice. When I watch a scary movie there is certain things I like and one of those thing's is to be kept of the edge of my seat and this movie really didn't deliver in that area, A lot of the story was similar but not what i expected to see in a fog remake. The diary wasn't found in the church like in the original or even found by the priest. The whole ending was changed and I still can't figure out why such a big change. I don't want to give too much away for those who haven't seen it so I've tried to be vague but as a complete fan of the original this new version didn't compare. It was more like a sequel than a remake and if they had changed the character names and labeled it the fog 2 I would have been good with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Made for Moviegoers born after 1980 by movie makers "born after 1980"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fog emulates exactly what its supposed to emulate: entertainment for moviegoers born between 1980 and 1993 roughly. moviegoers born between "1980 and 1993, roughly" watch way too much TV, talk-talk-talk-talk-TALK way too much on cell phones, are on the internet for 3 hours a day it seems. and yes of course "Lord of the Rings" is the end-all-be-all of motion pictures. The Fog is empty and thoughtless, the "impatience" of its pacing never establishes suspense, the cast is "young". BUT . . . The Fog ('05)made me jump every-time and loathe the sheer creepiness of the terror therein. My mom and dad took my brother and I to see The Fog (original) on my 10th birthday as my first "rated R" movie--its what got me "into" collecting soundtracks. Just as moviegoers born between 1980 and 1993 roughly have a staid sense of aesthetics(can anyone hum the theme for "Friends" the defining show for "your" generation? but i can hum the theme of Greatest American Hero and The Munsters), The Fog ('05) has a staid sense of aesthetics. but it made me jump and it explored the leprosy aspect a little moreand hey . . . everyone in the cast probably digs "Friends" replete with its insipid episode titles. So "The Fog" is "horror" in its current state for its current audience. I can't relate to the Fog but I dig the Fog, I understand where its coming from. see it. 10 outta 10. an apt rating. It would have been R in 1980, remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland, disappointing, why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's original "The Fog" is a classic. A minor classic, but a classic nonetheless. Now, I'd read some pretty good press about this re-make, and the fact that Carpenter himself was on board as a producer seemed like a good omen. Let's just say I went in with an open mind. I was prepared for, if not a better film than the original, at least an intriguing update. Boy, was I disappointed. This film lacks everything that made the first one special : heart, good performances, and above all, atmosphere. This remake goes through the motions, but has none of the genuinely chilling moments from the original. The acting is atrocious, particularly by the leads. The supporting cast is actually pretty good, they just aren't given anything interesting to do. Case in point. In the original, Hal Holbrook's Father Malone was an integral part of the plot. His entire character encapsulated the theme of the sins of the past haunting the present. Whereas, in this version, Malone comes of as a modern incarnation of "Friday the 13th's" Crazy Ralph (You're doomed!). The character is given no motivation, no identity, no reason to even be there. And can we please PLEASE keep these WB actors where they're meant to be . . .ON THE WB!! Tom Welling is obviously completely out of his depth, and he's trying way too hard to "act". Check out Tom Atkins in the original : subtle, nuanced, completely believable, and he never seems to be trying too hard. Maggie Grace, who I actually quite like on "Lost" looks, well, lost. The one pleasant surprise was Selma Blair as "Stevie Wayne". Granted, no one could really compete with Adrienne Barbeau from the original, but Selma at least gave it the good old college try. Finally, the ghosts. I'm all for make-up effects, but, as proved in the original, this is the kind of story where less is definitely more. In fact, the fact that, in the original, we only got fleeting glimpses of the drowned lepers, made them all the more frightening, particularly when there WAS a decent close up of Rob Bottin's excellent effects. The spirits in this thing are just too over-the-top, too, dare I say it, "Pirates of the Caribbean". Oh, and the music. Carpenter's music was one of the key ingredients in the first film's atmosphere. Whereas here, we get your typical cheesy-horror-movie jump-shock soundtrack. Not bad in its place, but complete anathema to a story that supposedly depends on subtlety. Finally, there's the fog itself. Remember the "glowing" fog from the original? Otherworldly? Mysterious? And genuinely frightening. So, 26 years later, after all of these amazing special effects advances, what do we get? We get fog that looks a hell of a lot like, hmm, what's the word I'm looking for? Oh yeah . . .fog. OK. I'm done ranting. The verdict? Save yourself $10.00. Rent the original. Turn the lights down low. And try to remember back to a time when they actually made decent horror movies, as opposed to pointless watered-down, pg-13 pieces of . . .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Believe The Bad Reviews People. Fog Is Exactly As Advertised!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a handful of Fog reviews you'd think this movie killed people's children. It's a movie people!! And it was a good one. It was scary and it kept me entertained and darn it if that's not all I'm looking for.I didn't even really really know it was a remake, except for a couple kids in the rows around me saying over and over This can't ever be as good as the original. So I got it. Remake city. Fine. I don't care. Looking for a cheap thrill and something to talk about with the girlfriend. Not looking for Citizen Kane or Frank Capra. Looking for a movie which by its very own admission is going to be cheap and shallow and scary and Hey, look at the panties? So here's my 2 cents.Good movie. Feel free to disagree but you'll have to take yourself down a few dozen levels of movie snob to relate back my arguments. The script was a little cheesy just like every horror movie you'll see this year and next. The acting was a little thin which wasn't at all that surprising. Plot holes? You betcha. Did they wreck the movie? Nooooooooo. Cause it was still scary and still fun. The best parts were the direction of the action and the fog special effects. The movie has a few excellent car crashes, one that was really intense and purposeful, and one that was just for a big bang but it will still cool to watch - because this one wasn't in every TV spot so you didn't know it was coming. The ending that everybody seems to hate was just a good HUH? ending. Didn't pull punches or negate the last hour and a half. Once you see the final frame reveal of the movie, work backwards people! It all makes sense. Put it together piece by piece, small clue by small clue, and suddenly you'll be satisfied and even a little glad that the movie played with your mind a little. I don't like posting. Got a life to live. But all you guys need to relax a little. Did the people who made this movie say The Fog is the single greatest film in the history of the visual medium and deserves to be so honored? Huh no buddy. They didn't say much of anything except This is a scary movie and it's October. Go eat popcorn. So relax, and stop taking the movie and yourselves so seriously. It was good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know there are many haters of this movie but it's not that bad. I am no way affiliated with the movie, aside from loving the original ;), or anything else relating to it before you suggest it Anyone who has seen the original will scrutinize this movie (Even I did). Yes, the original IS better but the remake does what it's here to do.I barely thought of this as a remake since they added this intrigue that changes the feel and movie in general. There's more stress on the back story which is nice but not for a horror movie.Another thing that really ruined the movie in my eyes was the deaths. There were more than the original, which was much appreciated, but they were not at all creative. Half of the deaths aren't even shown on screen, =( Bottom line, this movie serves it's purpose and is worth the money to have a bit of fun and a few scares.However, I am still deeply disappointed that it seem just thrown together. I know they were limited with the PG 13 Rule (Enforced by the company) to give it a broader audience, but just seeing the things they mildly did made me wish they had gone with it. I didn't like the romance they attempted to add in the remake; horror should be just horror. The ghosts IN the fog need a bit of help too. I LOVED how we saw their rotting flesh and bones but they shouldn't have been transparent. Yes, they ARE ghosts but it made them feel weak. The 'Ghosts' in the original were ghosts but appeared opaque which creeped me out.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow. I... liked it? Yeah. I did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly can't believe I liked this movie. An overplotted, annoyingly-teen-cast remake that butchered the slow tense beat of the first Fog... and I really liked the it. Eh, not exactly. The movie is 5/10, maybe, but I enjoyed seeing it in the theater. It was scary, it was stylish, it was really loud and thus affective, and it was different! Again, very overplotted, but I ignored all of that. I think it'll be disappointing on DVD because you need the talkback-theater screaming in the dark LOUD experience of seeing it live, but damn if I didn't enjoy it. Yes, the ending was silly and really didn't have to be there, but it'll give you something to argue about. Even if I hate a movie I like it to be debatable. The Fog is VERY debatable. Love it or hate it, you'll want to talk about it. And it's fun. Not as good as the original in screenplay, drama, acting, or tension, but it was still a more enjoyable movie because there were big loud scares and it moved very quickly.See it if you like to jump in your seat, like to roll your eyes, and like a scary movie that isn't afraid to try something different even if it fails in doing so. Honestly, the actual quality of the movie? 5. The experience of seeing said movie? 9. Really.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do not see the Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved the original 1980 version of John Carpenter's "The Fog" and I was excited that they were remaking it. Finally, a "Fog" for my generation! I went into the movie with high expectations but my illusions were shattered within the first 15 minutes. The only good thing that I can say about this movie was that Tom Welling was really pretty. Maybe too pretty. He plays a fisherman in this movie but I don't think any fisherman that I know of shave their chests. The whole cast was sleepwalking through this movie. You might say that they were in a fog. Tom Welling was no Superman, Maggie Grace was Lost, and Selma Blair? More like Selma BLAH! The cast was not the only cringe inducing aspect of this "movie". The FX were evil bad. It looked like stock footage from Pirates of the Caribbean. My Playstation 2 had better graphics than this. Overall the movie sucked big time. If you are thinking about seeing this film, save yourself some time and just punch yourself in the face because that is what watching this felt like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another fantastically made horror remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lately I have noticed that far too many IMDb reviewers are just getting extremely harsh on films!! Now that either means they are far too critical or I am becoming far too soft, although I do admit I tend to like certain films or style of films more than others and horror happens to be one of those genres. I hadn't seen the original 1980 John Carpenter's The Fog until very recently and I was pleasantly surprised. It was low budget and had Carpenter's brilliant horror style to it. I anxiously awaited to see this remake with one of my favorite TV Actors in the lead role (Tom Welling.) I wasn't disappointed in the least. After last year's incredible Amityville Horror remake and now The Fog which is at least as good as the original. After all not a whole bunch has changed. Remarkably director Rupert Wainwright, who has mostly music videos to his credit, kept this remake very much on par with it's original. There were scenes that were almost lifted straight from the original...hey if it ain't broke, don't fix it, I like that theory!!!Tom Welling holds his own in his first leading non-teen role as Nick Castle, a charter boat Captain who's lost love shows up out of nowhere and draws him into the mystery surrounding their small town and island. If he continues on this path he just might be able to leave behind his teen image and his "Clark Kent" and break into films which I think would be awesome. He's tough and macho and pulls off the protector role quite well. Fellow TV Alumn Maggie Grace from "Lost" takes on the lead female role as Elizabeth who returns to their small town with nightmares about a scary past. She does a stellar job in the scream queen role that Jamie Lee Curtis originated. However in this remake her character is far more utilized than Curtis' ever was. Wainwright chose to make Elizabeth the central female character as opposed to Stevie Wayne who was more the central lead in the original. Selma Blair takes the role of radio DJ Stevie Wayne and she doesn't quite have the intensity necessary for the role. Perhaps after seeing the original I expected more from her character but her performance seemed very dry and rather emotionless. Her character was almost pointless and she was so vital to the original story. Welling and Grace have excellent chemistry together, hot in fact, would love to see them team up again.The film delivers some awesome scares and is still filmed in a gritty dark, very claustrophobic setting so it holds what the original did for movie goers. The remake does move at a little faster pace, it seems to have left behind the build up that the original had which could be good or bad depending on how you look at it. Faster pace, but perhaps leaves something behind in the plot. At times it feels like it's moving at breakneck speed and you're missing something, and it seems like the characters are moving from location to location without any explanation as to where they are which can leave you a little confused. The Ghost Story aspect of it has been changed slightly but it's still there and it's still all about vengeance. Everyone seems to find out about the killer fog, and the mystery behind it far too quickly. There is never much back story to anything. Nonetheless the chills and gore the film delivers make up for that. There are lots of times you'll jump out of your seat and although it's not quite as gory as the original it holds it's own for a PG-13 rated movie!! I think people are being far too harsh on this film, I think it's a decent scary, ghost story, slasher flick with good characters and a great setting. See this and then see Amityville Horror (remake) this Halloween and you'll be pleasantly scared crazy!! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was really good. It had a lot of intense moments and great actors. In my opinion Tom Welling really broke away from his Smallville role to make this a good movie. Maggie Grace's character seemed to close to the character she plays on Lost, but she also made it a good movie. Selma Blair was really good too. I thought it was confusing on why her character was in there at all, but she worked well with the movie. All-in-all it was great! Tom and Maggie are great together on the screen. It really kicked my Halloween spirit into more gear. If you think the trailer looked dumb or something, go see it anyway. Others may say its stupid and its a waste of time, but go see for yourself you might actually like it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great PG-13 horror film....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie I though was truly one of the scariest things I have ever seen. I was so bored so I went with my friends to see this and it was great. I got really scared with all the rotting bodies being shown and the music and jumpy surprises, but thats a horror movie, right. well, overall it was amazing how scary a pg-13 movie could be. Tom Welling did a wonderful job as Nick, a fisherman who is a descendant of one of the town founders. I'm not just saying that because I'm a big fan of Smallville, his show on the WB. Maggie Grace did a great job as Elizabeth, though I was sad to see she didn't end up with Tom. My favorite character was probably Stevie, played beautifully by Selma Blair. Normally, I don't really care for her, but she was awesome in this and Hellboy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please skip this movie. The filmmakers mangled the story so bad that it rarely makes sense. The ending is baffling. The most entertaining moments are when Tom Welling takes his shirt off. Honestly. When you try to add so much back-story to a tale that really doesn't need it, well you're in for trouble. The movie becomes weighted down by stuff that has absolutely nothing to add. Maggie Grace gives one of the worst performances I've ever seen. Other characters make no logical sense. If it weren't for the occasionally good visual this movie wouldn't have even rated a 2. If you've really been wanting to see this movie, and judging by the size of the audience I saw it with tonight, there aren't really that many. Wait till video. Save a few bucks.</fullReview>

The effects were scary at times, but the dialogue was completely forced. It seemed as though the writers/director had no clue how to make a movie.The plot was confusing, because you couldn't tell what was going on. The reason for this, is because of all the flashbacks to the same island over 100 years ago. What was really bad, was the ending. Not only, did it seem too predictable, but it took forever to finish once it began.

Upon seeing this turd, I groaned with despite."Crap" doesn't even do justice to the utter Kay-Rap that was Fog 2005. The actors were completely age inappropriate for their roles. It's like the studio (as they all too often do) sexified every aspect of what was once one of the great horror classics. Too much modern gadgetry, and not enough atmosphere. All performances were awful, and the ghosts of the Elizabeth Dane looked like rejects from the drawing board at Pirates of the Caribbean (I especially disliked the absurd "Slash" of GNR pirate ghost).I nearly walked out of the theater on this one.What a flippin' disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whoa, what a mess. I would have given this movie 1 star, but Selma Blair starred in this exercise on how NOT to make a remake (see stinker). She doesn't do much in the movie (and her character doesn't even come close to Adrienne Barbeau's turn) but neither do any of the other characters for that matter (blame the script and director, not the actors).Whereas in the original, John Houseman set the creepy tone with his captivating ghost story around the campfire, this version tries (and fails miserably) to recreate what happened 100+ years ago off the coast of Antonio Island. I was completely confused by the string of events and wondered why we needed to see this flashback at all. In fact, almost every decision Rupert Wainwright ("director" of said remake) made was a bad one. He should have just stuck with the original script, since he obviously has no sense for creating suspense. None at all!I was bored out of my skull the entire movie (actually, I left 10 minutes before the end when it tried to substitute scares with car crashes). So beware of the high ratings. Ninety percent of reviews that appear before the movie opens is from people who worked on the film or who are associated with it in some way (i.e., they can't "afford" the bad word of mouth).And how bad can it possibly be? At one point, the character of Dan the weatherman (in another botched scene compared to the original) yells at the fog, "Is this some kind of joke?" Unfortunately, the answer is a resounding, "Yes!" And more unfortunately, that joke is on the people who paid to see this suckfest.</fullReview>

Never felt for the characters and too much of the plot was just thrown in with nothing behind it. It confuses you enough to distract you from the story they're trying to tell. It's like they had a good story, wrote a bunch of scenes, choosing ones to splice together even though they didn't fill in all the gaps. Like: "Oh, we have to have some partyers. Yea! How about out on the sea?.. Yea!. And throw in some dancing chicks! Yea, guys like dancing chicks. Well, so what if they don't match up and look out of place, I want dancing chicks! OK.. breaking glass, yea! Lets throw in some breaking glass cause it looks good. So where can we put it? Let's put it here, there and...throw in another. OH! Where're gonna need fog. Yea! lot's of fog. I mean, it is the name of the movie. OK, Love interest. Well, how did she get on that remote road for him to see her? Oh, it doesn't matter, we have to have them meet up so just toss it in."You know what I'm saying? They just didn't piece things together to support a good story. They made an attempt to make it creepy at times yet it never got even close to believable enough to take you on the ride. Instead you were an observer watching something that had too many things stand out for you to ever come close to taking it seriously, being a part of it, effected by it. It doesn't necessarily push you away yet it never comes close to reeling you in.So since you know and can read what it's about, thats how I reacted to it. In short... bland chocolate. Looks good, seems sweet yet just.... no flavor.Wait for DVD</fullReview>

Now I am all for suspending reality for the sake of a good movie but some of the scenes in this movie were far beyond that. The cast was about as unimpressive as the film itself. This movie is not entertaining in the least. I can only hope that the original is better than this. Maybe I should give it a shot at redemption from the complete waste that the remake is.

		<fullReview>The 2005 remake of John Carpenter's "The Fog" is the worst kind of disappointment. It's a movie that had promise and potential to be effective and creepy, yet it throws it all away. The worst offense the movie makes is that, using all the same materials, it could have been a lot better.The plot concerns a heavy fog that rolls into a coastal Oregon town, containing malevolent forces in it, desperate for an attempt to right past wrongs done to them. Underneath all the backstory, an intriguing mystery exists, yet the filmmakers all but ignore it to go for the cheap thrills and scares.There's absolutely no character development here either, even though there are hints at it throughout. For example, Tom Welling's character is the ancestor of one of the town's founders, yet he resents his family name appearing on the tribute statue. This is never explained, nor is the strained relationship between Maggie Grace's character and her mother, as well as the motivations of the crazy, drunk priest who seems to know more about the town's history than he lets on.I couldn't help but wonder what kind of movie this would have turned out to be if another writer was given a shot at the screenplay. Rupert Wainwright's direction is competent, but paired with a script that throws a lot of good ideas down the drain, the end result is just a big mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog Will be Great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fog is based on the old horror movie back in the day.Even awhile back this movie scared many people worldwide.Now, we all knew it was coming.... the remake of the fog. The remake contains actors suck as Tom welling and Selma Blair in the gripping suspense filled horror movie. First and for most my boy boy Tom Welling, hes a good actor. He has been in the film cheaper by dozen in the famous TV show Smallville.(best TV show ever? I would like to see him in a lot more hero based movies but what can you do.. Overall the the actors and the plot make the movie which in this case leaves you with a theater movie. Not a renter a theater movie. Yes i said it, this should be one you watch in the theaters, thats all i got to say... I'm done</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow that was one of the worse movies I have seen in a while and I am forgiving. Like people I try to find the good in everything but Tom Wellington without a shirt for about 2 seconds was about it. The special effects were decent but the acting was poor and the dialogue was poor. They had this guy (not sure if he was even named) that comes out of...sure enough the fog.....with half of his face missing and says something about his dogs and his face missing and he disappears into the mist. I am sitting here thinking of the scene and laughing because shortly before that they run into a boat in the middle of the road. Where did that come from? I was not impressed at all. I was going to be entertained and only thing that was entertaining was making fun of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've eagerly awaited a good horror film. The kind of film that actually raise the hair on my arms, something that actually sends a chill down my back, creates the childhood terror I felt as the monster/ zombie/ ghost/ etc... was about to take a victim.The Fog was not that movie.This film does employed an array of the standard horror film shots and setups, and does on occasion invoke truly creepy settings. It also had some great visual effects (as is overwhelmingly standard from a studio pic).However The main story felt incomplete and forced especially when balanced with the well developed background story constantly told through flashbacks.The acting was competent despite the script.Ultimately a forgettable film with weak storytelling and great casting that was orchestrated to make a quick buck and nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is unsatisfying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to pick out every plot hole with this film, though it could be very easy, I am just going to warn you that it is a waste of money. The only way I could see this as entertaining is if I were making fun of it with a bunch of friends.Now this isn't to say that there were no redeeming factors of the film. The sound effects, such as the pounding at the door and the sound of the fog rushing in, along with a few special effects were done quite well. But the overall style of the film is reminiscent of every bad horror movie out there; loud noises as opposed to actually being frightening. I may have jumped a few times from bursts of loud music that startle the sense, but never once was I afraid. I also have to admit that during one of the most "horrific" parts of the movie, I was fighting to stay awake.All in all, this was not a very well crafted film that left in me a "fog" especially with the confusing and ridiculous ending.Thank you, TAD</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>it sucked!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, I'll say that John Carpenter's "The Fog" is my favorite movie of all time, so maybe I was hoping this movie would suck because I was mad that it was being remade. Going in to see this movie, I had very low expectations, and I left disappointed. This movie was very poorly written. They never introduced the story behind why the fog was coming and you only find out towards the end. So people who never saw JC's The Fog, are confused through the entire movie. This movie was not scary, not funny when they wanted to laugh, funny when they wanted you to be scared, and just down right dragged on. Of all the horrible remakes, this is the worst. And worst of all, the ending had to be the dumbest ending in the history of dumb endings. JC's ending is my favorite ending ever, so I wasn't expecting the remake's to surpass it, and surely, it didn't. Actually, the ending was the only thing about the movie I was looking forward to see, So maybe that's why I was so disappointed in this movie even though I had low expectations. I believe nothing is perfect (no 10/10, except JC's The Fog), so nothing is worthless (no 0/10), I give it 1/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fog left me in the fog???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this movie had a good way to start off. the classic old start off with a scary scene that you have no idea whats going on them cut to a happy present time with a beautiful women starting the day off with one of her old routine that you soon find out to love. then you meet the minor characters in a pan of quick shots to show the scenery with a calm soothing melody in the background. had a good story but no explanation. i was left thinking, "What just happened." with the cliché movie parts and quick ending i was left wanting. the graphics were pretty good and got my heart going a little bit in the end. plus there were one or two spots in the movie were i even might have jumped it i didn't see the clip in the trailers or teasers on TV.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pails in Comparison to the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me preface by saying, I was looking forward to this movie because I liked the original John Carpenter classic. I felt the original had a good story, but because of special effect limitations (due to technology and budget) that it was never made in to the truly awesome movie it was so capable of being. This movie came out in the age of CGI, so I figured: finally, a remake that might correct an injustice. How wrong I was. The story took a lot of it's elements and characters (if not the character names) from the original, but it cut out many scenes that gave the original so much excitement and changed the back story in ways that made it hokey at best. The last 20 minutes of the movie were exciting (aside from the ending). But, potential movie goers would be better served to just stay home and watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Fizzle... is more like it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying this film is an insult to the memory of Debra Hill and the Classic tale by John Carpenter. This is one of the worst movie remakes I have seen. This film had a promise that was never met. The abilities to have made an awesome remake and homage to the original was there but the people whose hands it was placed in had no idea how to pull it off. There are references to the classic film from 1980 although they are scattered about as much as this script is. The story revolves around a young woman who returns to her hometown during a strange occurrence in which an an enormous and eerie fog seeks out revenge on the townsfolk. The setting is taken away from California to Oregon on an Island. The location is perfect and eerie but the cast is so inept and awful it literally hurts to see them act or care about them. The worst being Selma Blair doing a painful to watch and listen too rock and roll DJ. This whole movie seemed miscast and a lot of background on the characters and their relationships are just hinted at and never explained. The only scary moment in this entire films comes during a scene where a young boy is on the beach and the fog starts to roll in. This film should have completely had the energy and feel of this moment throughout but it didn't. The monsters in the fog, or what there are of monsters, do not compare to those in John Carpenters original and are less threatening. Bad, bad, bad, bad...did I mention this movie was bad. Stay away from this wreck of a film. I feel so cheated and disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Avoid at all costs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was terrible. It tried way too hard, and wasn't scary at all. Had the obligatory dumb teens parading around clueless and in their underwear at some points, and the ending was horrible. They took a simple movie from the 80's and turned it into a complex mini epic horror tale, which at the end turns into a love story in a moronic way, for all those who see this, it will leave u saying "what the hell?". The old "The Fog" was a simple tale, ghosts of dead sailors coming back for the gold that was jacked from them, they kill a few people with hooks and such, movie ended, simple as that. This new one is filled with fire, flying glass, people being pushed around by 'unseen' forces, and way too many REALLY fake looking CGI ghosts. What happened to good Ole gory makeup and old tattered clothes? I suggest you guys check out the original The Fog before checking this out, or even better, save your money and wait for it to come on cable, or if you find 4 bucks somewhere, go rent it once it comes out...or don't see it at all</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some good elements, but weak overall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was interested to see this movie, being a big fan of John Carpenter's 1980 original. But something told me a horror remake in 2005 couldn't beat a classic, and shock, shock...I was right.The movie isn't a total waste, just that some things work and some don't. Selma Blair, while indeed a good actress, doesn't fill the shoes of Adrienne Barbeau as Stevie Wayne. And Tom Welling and Maggie Grace, though capable actors (and good eye candy) are poor substitutes for the original cast and seem to only be there to draw in the teenyboppers. Yes, that does mean we get shots of Maggie Grace walking around in her panties and even a shirtless Tom scene.The main problem with this new version is that due to bad choices either by the writer or the director, the scare factor is minimized significantly. For one, the ghosts in the fog are often shown as silly CGI zombies that remind you of something out of "The Mummy." At one point the fog forms into a screaming angry face, but instead of being scary it just looks cheap and silly. The ghosts themselves are actually transparent, which weakens their presence, yet somehow they are able to perform tasks the ghosts from Carpenter's original weren't capable of, like attacking people from kitchen sinks (a scene that actually is more comedic than horrifying) and strolling around at ease when there doesn't even seem to be any fog present. Aren't these things supposed to be CONFINED within the fog? Apparently someone forgot that come the finale...Rupert Wainright, try as he may, just isn't capable of pulling off the atmosphere of mystery and dread Carpenter infused into his original. Carpenter's "Fog" was downright creepy...a twisted ghost tale set in a small fishing village that had a dark past. It dripped with atmosphere. This one's just a drip. The new town locals are undeveloped and boring and no matter how many wide shots we get of the fog rolling in off the coast of Antonio Bay, it doesn't evoke the same sense of dread Carpenter's did.The story was also changed drastically in one respect, and the final outcome is unsatisfying and makes you wonder why they even bothered writing that into the screenplay to begin with.All in all, there are some very decent chills and scares in this movie (one scene in particular involving Blair's son on the beach and a vagrant snooping around with a metal detector is very thrilling...), but no matter how many CGI zombies and cheap shocks you have, you can't beat a good classic ghost story with tons of atmosphere...therefore this one is stale compared to Carpenter's.It's not as bad as most of the new horror movies out there. But it's just not the original.See it to remember why you loved the original so much and to get a new twist on the story plus one or two really good scares. Not a total waste of time.</fullReview>
