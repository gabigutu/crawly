		<shortDescription>Sometimes One of these "hits the spot"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger Corman has an unusual reputation. He has produced or directed a large number of "cheapie" movies--including this one, which was shot in Russia(per the DVD commentary, even the interior shots were done on soundstages in St. Petersberg).Sometimes, one just doesn't feel like some sort of heavy-duty, call-to-action movie--say, like "Spartactus"(1963). On the other hand, if you feel like being entertained, "Arena"(2001), is likely to "hit the spot" very nicely. Just like a lot of Roger Corman's films.The fact of the matter is that, surprisingly, the screenplay is well-crafted and not as goofy as you might think. The Romans did try to implement their customs wherever they conquered--including the contests of the gladiators as they were being performed in the Great Coliseum in Rome. And there was even a disastrous attempt to perform them in Greece(the Greeks rioted because of the carnage). Female gladiators--while unusual--were not unknown and some of them even appeared in "Gladiator" with Russell Crowe. A wooden, scaled-down clone of The Great Coliseum in Rome is not only possible, it is likely that there were hundreds of them in the forested frontier regions of the Empire.A nice, fun movie for an evening's entertainment.But you could say the same thing about other movies from Roger Corman, notably "The Undead"(1957) and "The Dunwich Horror"(1969). Incidentally, many of today's movies are just that--entertainment--and, IMO, no apologies are necessary.Movies with "a message" are not--and should not be--the only alternative.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty remake of the '73 Corman classic to cash in on the success of Ridley Scott's GLADIATOR.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a prime little exploitation flick with a couple of cute, costumed Playboy-Bunny gladiatrix being harassed by the local Roman invaders. It's an update of Roger Corman's Pam Grier classic from the early seventies, spiced up with some flash-cut editing, filtered cinematography and impressive location photography done in Russia. There's enough flesh peddling, sleazy sexual situations and action to reasonably satisfy today's B-movie fans, but it's all relatively kinder and gentler than viewers should expect from your typical exploitation flick. The most enjoyable thing about the DVD release is the mini-commentary supplements from the two lead bunnies. It's an amusing take on their adventures as low-budget movie stars and adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the feature. Frankly, I'm surprised there aren't a lot more cheesy, sword-and-sandal ripoffs in the wake of Ridley Scott's enormously successful GLADIATOR. This is one genre where the sky's the limit!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Do You really think Gladiator was historically better?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Roger corman went to Russia to produce this ludicrous exploitation movie, trying to gather an audience through the use of Gladiator fame and two beatiful playmates (Lisa Dergan and Karen McDougal) as the leadign actressess of this mess. Rest sure that you get plenty of gore, less nudity than you may expect (but both the leading ladies are really gorgeous), and a story that is almost non-existent, but it is not really so bad as you may think before. As for historicity, even Scott's magnus opus is abysmal in that respect; so, The Arena, at least in this respect, is not worse than its Oscar winning model</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More fun exploitation from Corman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course Roger Corman was going to cash in on the success of "Gladiator" by having one of his films from the 70's remade. Probably not as good as the original since I have not seen it but this still is entertaining junk. Playboy playmates are cast and of course they are kidnapped, raped, forced to train, and then of course to fight as female gladiators. Here's your chance to see female gladiators with very noticeable breast implants. The film is made with a serious tone and mood and definitely not tongue in cheek. Entertaining exploitation that was actually filmed in Russia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy it for what it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're reading this having not seen The Arena yet, it should be painfully obvious what you're in for: a low-budget Gladiator knock-off filmed in Russia and starring a couple of Playboy girls, meaning you're in for a lot of graphic scenes of good old-fashioned Roman debauchery.Sure enough, no surprises to be found... although it wasn't the unapologetic T&amp;A festival that I expected (not the whole way through, at least). As actresses, Karen McDougal and Lisa Dergan make great centrefolds and the rest of the cast list looks like the starting lineup for the Detroit Red Wings, only with better English-speaking skills. The storyline is decadent at best and it features possibly one of the most audacious endings I've seen in recent years that was worthy of fifteen minutes of laughter all on its own.The Arena turns out to be a toga party and a mud wrestling competition rolled into one... it's cheap entertainment, and I liked it. Enjoy it for what it is, try not to think too hard, and you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to believe...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1st watched 10/12/2001 - 3 out of 10(Dir-Timour Bekmambetov): Hard to believe, american playboy playmates pose as female gladiators in this Russian film obviously financed by Americans for video release. This is actually a remake of a Roger Corman film of the early seventies and guess what(He is the executive producer of this film). Lots of violence, some sex but mostly cheaply done film trying to profit on the recent films that have been done in this realm. At least this is not too exploitative of the women in the film. They are more human than most of the men portrayed in the movie, but again this is an obvious movie that was created and setup for a particular purpose and it reaks of this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>please, don't watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the bargain bin and mistook it for The Arena from 1974 , with Pam Grier. I bought it since it was so cheap and I was in a hurry. Only to find out it wasn't the movie I had in mind when I got home. No harm done I said to myself and decided to give the movie a go. Wrong idea. The scenery is plain, the acting is below mediocre (even extending to horrible) and the cinematography is boring as hell. For those into just nude chicks, pass the movie as well. While the 2 female "stars" (i believe i read somewhere they are former playboy models) rarely show any flesh.If for some reason you still want to see this movie, please have brain-surgery</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun with swords, clubs, wooden prisons and T&amp;A</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not gladiator but it is not bad. The worst thing about this movie is that you constantly feel like you are watching a Japanese film that has been dubbed in English. The voices of the Playmates are the ones that belong to them but I can't be sure of any of the others.The two main female characters are lovely. AND YES they do get nekkid. In the Featurette for Lisa Dergen she revealed that the guy she was supposed to be having sex with was very nervous, she was not as she had partaken in quite a bit of wine and was dis-inhibited. She said that somewhere in the scene he leaned over and whispered in her ear the he was gay. She laughed. In the editing it just looks like she is enjoying his labors so they left it in.The sets are not bad but the "cells" where the slaves are kept are pretty flimsy wood. Really not strong enough to keep in what we are supposed to believe are warriors. They did do a very good job of making things look used instead of brand new.The SOUND other than the dubbed feeling is quite good.The dialogue oft times written as though it is intended to be sarcastic but rendered with complete sincerity. I wonder if that is due to non-English speaking actors giving dialogue phonetically.The fight scenes are not up to par with much of anything else I have scene of this type. Editing is used to make up for the lack of good coordination among the fighters but it doesn't quite make up for it.For an afternoon of fun and a good bit of T&amp;A THE ARENA is a good choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worst movie I've ever seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the worst movie I have ever seen. Here are some of the reasons.1 - Everything inside of the very impressive wooden coliseum is yellow..everything outside it is blue.2 - at the beginning of the movie a guy gets cut in half...he makes the sound of a velociraptor dying as in Jurassic park.. two minutes later the exact same scream is heard...after 1 hour into the movie I had counted that same scream 5 times.3 - The acting is terrible.4 - the leaders helmet is way to big for his head.5 - the girls that are forced to fight in the arena are bought from a very economical slave dealer... let me show you why. The roman goes up to him and wants to buy the hot playmate chick...apparently shes a 100 gold...he offers 60 the slave dealer refuses..the roman offers 65 the slave dealer refuses..But 'lo and behold the slave dealers has a great deal for the roman...all of the 5 girls for 70 gold! apparently thats enough for him!I hope these 5 simple points will persuade you into seeing this movie so I am not the only one that knows what hell looks like before death. The only reason that this move got a 2 out of 10 is because the playmate is hot and because the leader throws his wine over some chick because she spills some..that was pimp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT*I was strolling through the Action section of Blockbuster the other day when I spotted this one. "The Arena". Interesting...I looked closer. It had two Amazon gladiator chicks doing battle in "The Arena". I thought about reading the description on the back of the box but then thought better of it. It couldn't possibly be any more enticing than the front. Why ruin a perfectly good Amazon warrior movie with plot ramblings? Naturally, it didn't take long for this one to disappoint me. I've got to learn to control my B-movie lust. I see Amazons fighting, I get excited. I can't help myself. "The Arena" is an ambitious movie. It longs to be more than just a movie with two hot chicks fighting to the death. Why the filmmakers would want this is unknown. It has a plot, characters, drama, weird camera angles and all sorts of things that shouldn't be anywhere near an Amazon sword fighting flick.There was one scene that started to scare me. The Romans are celebrating their victory by having a party. This party has all the soldiers in a circle holding hands, jumping up and down and shouting "Ho! - Ho! - Ho! Ho! Ho!". This drags on for about three minutes. I wasn't sure where this male bonding party was heading. Fortunately, the Amazons broke up the festivities before things got out of hand. Amazon women save the day again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Naked Warriors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film four times now. It is a remake of the film, Naked Warriors (Pam Grier and Margaret Markov). Grier and Markov also made a film called Black Mama, White Mama (1973), a women in prison film. The Arena is not a bad remake--it owes much to the original film and to two other films/series, yes Ridley Scott's Gladiator and the series, Xena, Warrior Princess. It treats the women with a certain amount of respect and quickly focuses on their love/hate/love relationship. Another film of the same type from the Sixties: Thor and the Amazon Women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad Editing and Directing Make This Film Almost Unwatchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm astonished to read reviews recommending this film for its T&amp;A factor. Considering it is clearly a B-level exploitation film starring two former Playboy Playmates, you'd THINK it had T&amp;A aplenty but it has very little. The four female gladiators who are the leads spend most of their time dressed in dowdy rags that cover them from neck to knees. There are some brief nude scenes and a couple of brief sex scenes, but like the rest of the movie they are jump cut so aggressively that you have a lot of trouble seeing what there is to see. Plus the sex scenes are seriously underlit. It is literally hard to watch the movie because of all the jump cutting. The fight scenes are filmed the same way, which helps somewhat with the rather obvious lack of fighting ability of the gladiatrixes (who don't do all that much fighting -- the fighting is handled by more capable male actors, who were also heavily jump cut, just like the rest of the movie).Most of the movie's dramatic opportunities are completely bobbled as well. The set up provides for plenty of drama: who shall live, who shall die, whom will be betrayed by whom, etc. Very little advantage was taken of it.If you are looking for well done gladiator movies, any single episode of the Starz series "Spartacus" will put this movie to shame. Deathstalker and Barbarian Queen have MUCH better fight scenes as well as more and better T&amp;A. "The Arena" is simply a failure, badly botched, not worth any attention at all. There are some MST3K-able bits, but even there the jump cutting is a problem. There is NOTHING to recommend this film. Do. Not. Watch. And if you do ... don't say you weren't warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would have been better as porn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a long-time fan of bad movies. I recognize them for what they are, and often they provide something I want for entertainment. Mindless violence, goofy comedy, or scantily women gallivanting about consorting with all manner of folk. There are times though, that even I can't find anything worth watching in a film.This is the trick with this "film". With drop-dead beautiful leads and a setting that had plenty of opportunity for great action sequences, I was really hopeful I'd find SOMETHING of note in this video. Unfortunately, there's nothing. The "fight" scenes look faker than a couple of 3 year olds with paper towel tubes. The acting is worse than some porn films I've seen, but without the sex that makes THOSE halfway worth watching! Seriously, don't waste your time on this piece of junk. If you do, you'll wish you listened to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lots of nudity, not much sense.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From what I could see, the only reason this movie exists is to give some very beautiful Playmates multiple opportunities to display the nude female figure divine. Regretfully, the nude scenes are (for me anyway) pretty much destroyed by poor editing; the constant cuts and pseudo-artsy close-ups become very distracting after a while. Maybe they were trying to avoid letting us see the silicone &lt;grin&gt;?The "actresses" can't act, even with their clothes off! Most of the characters are obviously speaking a different language overdubbed in English. As for the storyline, well, it's got so many holes in it, I wouldn't even know where to begin. Even the fights are poorly staged, their impact destroyed by dumb closeups and dizzying, confusing scene jumps.Too bad, with a little effort, it could actually have been a fairly decent movie. The first step would have had to be, give the Playmates some acting lessons. Both vertical and horizontal.One positive note: the scenes in which the women struggle to learn the fighting arts are actually quite well-done. You get the feeling the actresses enjoyed learning how to fight, and put themselves into it, without any phoniness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than Being Given Credit For, And Better Than I Thought It Would Be.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off the bat, you'd think that two former playmates playing gladiators would be just about as campy as The Bare Wench Project or something similar, meant solely to show as much T &amp; A as possible. That it was not (although it was not without it). I would say the violence in the movie far outweighed the T &amp; A (again, why cast playmates if there wasn't going to be at least some).My second misconception was that when these ladies would eventually do battle, it would be too "girlie" or fake, like you could tell the actresses didn't want to break a nail for the sake of the movie. This was very much unlike the "gang fight" in Savage Roses AKA Locas 4 Life, where you could tell every kick was pulled and was probably the first time the actress had even attempted to kick someone. Anyways, I never would have believed that Karen McDougal and Lisa Dergan would have been able to handle a sword believably. I'm sure they were just props, so as to make them lighter and easier to handle, but that's the point right? To make everything as believable as possible.With that being said, and knowing that I thought it was worth a watch, the one thing that bugged me was the voice acting. Apparently this movie was filmed in Russia, and probably used many Russian actors, but the voices spoken were perfect English. This resulted in the old Kung Fu movie look where hearing the words didn't match up with watching the lips saying the words. However, if you're a lip reader, you can tell they were saying the same thing. This confused me a bit but I got over it. I also didn't know they had nail salons in ancient Rome, or wherever they were, but now I'm nitpicking. Overall, I'd recommend viewing this movie at least once. I was surprised that it was better than the 2.9 most IMDb voters chose to rate it (at the time this was wrote). MUCH better than the 2.9, in fact, I gave it a 7.</fullReview>
