		<shortDescription>Oh ! the Horror! the Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very cheaply made film by Director George Romero about a virus, known as Trixie, that has somehow leaked out in a small town in Western Pennsylvania. The military quickly comes, assesses the situation, and then implements martial law. This is a very thought-provoking film and has some clever dialog and direction here and there. The biggest problems arise with Romero's virtually absent budget. We have a cast of amateurs, some moved on to star in other films particularly by Romero. Richard Liberty as Frankenstein in Day of the Dead being the most noteworthy. Despite not having any star power, the cast for the most part does a decent job notwithstanding. But the settings, although very "realistic," just don't create a real sense of fear for me or believability. I wonder what this film might have been with a budget double the size. If you can get past the minuscule budget, you will find an interesting film here. A film I think that has some real issues at hand even now. The things Romero does do well is create suspense based on the feelings of time being an enemy and make some scathing social commentary on the nature of war, science in war, and apocalyptic threads concerning the way rules are all thrown out when faced with doomsday.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrific low budget paranoid thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero's zombie classics 'Night Of The Living Dead' and 'Dawn Of The Dead' are two of the best horror movies ever made, but they really cast a huge shadow over his career. Romero made two movies in between that are seriously overlooked, the fascinating character study of a vampire(?) 'Martin', and 'The Crazies', a paranoid thriller in a similar vein to the Dead movies. While not actually a zombie movie as such anyone who enjoys NOTLD or DOTD will find much to admire here. The budget is very low so the production values sometimes leave a bit to be desired and the acting is variable, but overall I think it's a terrific movie with some interesting echoes of both NOTLD and the Vietnam war. Will MacMillan (David) and Lane Carroll (Judy) aren't familiar to me, and neither is Lloyd Hollar who plays the Colonel in charge of the quarantine (he's very good), but cult fave Lynn Lowry ('Shivers') plays space case Kathy, her Dad (Richard Liberty) will be recognized by anybody who has seen 'Day Of The Dead', and David's 'Nam buddy Clank (Harold Wayne Jones) went on to appear in Romero's 'Knightriders'. And then there's the wonderful Richard France playing a similar character to the one he would memorably play in DOTD, an outraged scientist. 'The Crazies' pretty much flopped back in the 70s but looking at it now restored for DVD it's obviously one of Romero's best and a must for any horror buff. The commentary track by Romero and William 'Maniac' Lustig is also highly recommended as it offers lots of insights into the highs and lows of low budget film making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mass hysteria at its most intense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just in case some stubborn people are still questioning George A. Romero's talent after his 1968 milestone "Night of the Living Dead", we hereby present "The Crazies"! Once again a film stuffed with subtle criticism on society and pitch black humor. "The Crazies" immediately demands your full attention with a powerful pre-credits opening sequence and the high-excitement level is upheld throughout the entire movie. The little Pennsylvanian town of Evans City is overcome with a secret, but very lethal, government virus leaving the infected either dead or incurably insane. "Trixie" initially was developed as a chemical weapon, so not one of the scientists or army officers know how to put a stop to it when innocent people are exposed to it. The simple plot and cheap elaboration are excellently camouflaged by Romero's sharp eye for detail. Right from the start, he builds up a tense atmosphere of truly realistic mass hysteria that confuses even you ? the viewer ? in not knowing which characters are infected and which aren't. They could all simply be trigger-happy Pennsylvanian hillbillies for all we know! Although this film never really becomes "disturbing", there are quite a few scenes that shock and that feel strangely real. You could also state "The Crazies" was quite ahead of its time because chemical warfare is much more in the picture now than it was 30 years ago, when this film got shot. Romero's premise is simple but efficient: the malfunctioning and greed of the human race is much scarier than any fictional horror monster could ever be. Best example is the military men who become eerie and threatening in their icky white suits.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people in a small town in PA are exposed to a virus in their drinking water from the crash of a military plane. The virus is experimental germ warfare crated by the arming that will either cause its victims to die or go insane. Shortly after the start of the movie the military invades the town and puts it onto quarantine. The job of the military is to round up the townspeople and bring them into the town school. Also, scientists are brought in to look for a cure for the virus.You can definitely tell Romero directed it because the movie tries to focus on the people more than the situation. Romero did a great job in building the viewers sympathy for the townspeople. You can also tell this movie was created during the turmoil of Vietnam because the soldiers are portrayed as somewhat of the enemy. I say somewhat the enemy because their main duty is to quarantine the town and keep the virus from being a nationwide epidemic. As the chaos gets worse more and more townspeople get shot as apposed to being detained.Romero seems to always deliver big on the opening scene. In The Crazies he starts you out with a very chaotic situation. It does a great job setting the tone for the film.What this movie does well is keep the chaos going. The movie is shot with very quick scenes and jumps back and forth a lot between military and townspeople. I also thought the ending was well done.On the negative side the drumming gets a little bit annoying after a while. Each time they cut back to the high school you get military drumming. Also, some of the acting got a little too over the top.Overall, this is a fine movie and a must see for Romero fans. It is not as good as his first three "Dead" movies, but it is still a very solid film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very fine film by Romero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Aside from Dawn of the Dead, I feel that this little seen film is one of Romero's strongest vehicles. Indeed the two films have a great deal in common in terms of pacing, style and overall visual impact. It throws the viewer into the middle of a story with little introduction, and continues at a breakneck pace right until it's bleak conclusion. The wonderful thing about Romero's works is that he manages to take situations that might just be distantly possible and make them an absolute chaotic reality. This film is a testament to that, and may even stand as one of his more realistic and plausible stories. Performances on the part of almost all of the actors are very good, particularly the main group of focus. There are some awkward moments with David, but Judy is very good, and proves herself particularly in her final scenes. Clank is interesting to watch, and does a very good job of descending into a dangerous and confused haze. Richard Liberty's Artie is a favorite, though, due largely to a scene where he tells why he never allowed his daughter to date. He is truly creepy. Those on the military side are also very good, particularly Major Rider and Colonel Peckam. I must admit that I do have a soft spot in my heart for Richard France as Dr. Watts. He rants and relentlessly chews the scenery in a grand performance, and adds a wonderful dash of color and even more insanity to this bleak film. Romero is always interesting in his use of characters, and this film is no exception. He is constantly pushing the envelope of audience expectations by having major characters die or succumb to the madness. Nothing is safe in a Romero movie. His use of the soldiers is wonderful in the frenzied and gritty military and chase scenes. This film as a whole is gritty, unnerving and a perfect stylistic precursor to Dawn of the Dead. One of the better scare pictures of the 70s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unsettling in a very realistic way.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of his classic Night of the Living Dead (1968), horror master George Romero followed up with this low-budget thriller.Airplane crashes outside of a small Pennsylvania town and unleashes a bio chemical substance that turns the locals into murderous psychotics. The government steps in, but only makes things worse... far worse.George Romero's films have long been known for their violence, disturbing nature, and social commentary and this early film is no exception. The Crazies has exciting action wrapped all in a thought-provoking and unsettlingly believable story. There's plenty of moments of gore and a number of scenes that are quite horrific (burning preacher anyone?). Romero's direction is nicely done, providing tense atmosphere and using the rural locations of Pennyslvania well.Cast-wise some of the performances of this film seem a bit forced, but the performers do manage to hold it together. Harold Wayne Jones, Will MacMillian, and Lloyd Hollar are the best stand-outs.While The Crazies is often forgotten among the horror films of the 70's, it's a good film from a great director. A must for Romero fans.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Cinema of George A. Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies (1973) was a film by horror film maker George A. Romero. A military biological weapons is accidentally released in a small town. Evans City, PA. is the unlucky recipient to a very deadly virus that has fouled the nearby water supply. The virus is highly contagious and it causes madness and insanity in it's victims. The government tries to contain the after effects by imposing martial law around the town and quarantining the citizens of Evans City, affected or not. A few of the citizens rebel against the soldiers and try to flee the occupied zones. Can this small party escape the wrath of the government and it's soldier of fortunes or will they become victims of the bio-plague?George A. Romero has once again created a unique movie utilizing a small budget and a large cast of mostly volunteers. The camera work and editing is what makes this movie work. The acting is not that bad and the writing is very inventive and creative. Many look upon this movie as a trial run for his more successful zombie sequel Dawn of the Dead, others have called this a mere reworking of Night of the Living Dead. I have to say that this is a very entertaining movie that works despite the boundaries of it's limited budget. A social commentary that still rings true today.Highly recommended for George A. Romero fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie in desperate need of MORE craziness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like Romero's "Day of the Dead," this is another marathon of carnage and excess talk, filled with scattered themes (martial law, role of the military, bureaucracy, disease, etc.). It's high-concept stuff, granted, but the budget is low and the script is unfocused. Like the attorney general's definition of "terrorism," the effects of the virus in "The Crazies" is just as vague (abnormal behavior that varies from person to person), but the unpredictability gets tedious after a while. The reason David Cronenberg's similarly-themed "Shivers" worked so well is because the parasites had a specific function (to replace a dead organ) and side-effect (they transform people into sex maniacs), and were confined to one specific location (an apartment complex). "The Crazies" is ambitious, but the unengaging performances and heavy-handed symbolism (tattered American flags, toy soldiers stepped on by real soldiers) renders it a mediocre oddity on Romero's resume.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than a lot of other low budget horror for it's time, but NO zombies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plane crashes near Pittsburgh carrying a bacteriological weapon called "Trixie". It gets into a nearby town's water supply causing it's citizen to go crazy, some of them homicidal maniacs. Some of the town's residents try to escape through a cordon around the town set up by the Army and shooting between the residents and soldiers (who go around wearing white contamination suits) and blood spurts ensue. That pretty much sums up the plot.There's really no gore in this Romero film, but we do see plenty of gun battles that look cheap and amateurish. The only memorable character is Dr. Watts, played by Richard France, who's overacting is so bad that I actually liked his time on the screen. You can see he's trying real hard. The Blue Underground anamorphic DVD looks nice and it contains a short interview with co-star Lynn Lowry who explains some of her experiences on the film as well as her failed film career. Also a decent commentary track by George Romero who wishes he could have done more with it if he had a bigger budget.As long as one doesn't compare it to Romero's other films like the DEAD trilogy or MARTIN (1977), then it's better than most 70s low budget efforts in that cheap, charming way. I think it's worth a look.6 out of 10-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistently Weak</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crazies" (1973) was George Romero's attempt to get a little more low-budget mileage out of his "Night of the Living Dead" (1971) zombie-like stuff by blending it with elements from "The Andromeda Strain" (1971).A germ warfare bug is accidentally released into the water supply of a small western Pennsylvania town named Evans City (where it was actually filmed). It turns some into placid zombie-like creatures and some into out-of-control maniacs. The Army comes in and imposes martial law and the local civilians do a good imitation of the zombies from "Night of the Living Dead". The cast is a bunch of locals (western PA/NE Ohio) who fortunately for us all with low thresholds of pain did little acting after this project. Poor acting combines with poor editing to make it impossible to determine who among the citizens and the troops has the disease, is just stressed out, or is just trying to party hard. Romero's direction is extremely weak and he has trouble throughout keeping the cast in character.Romero had discovered with "Night of the Living Dead" that there was serious exploitation potential in stories about the breakdown of society and this is where he really tries to focus his film. There is an underlying theme of social commentary as this was the time of serious social protests (Kent State just across the state line), distrust of the federal government, and our winding down involvement in Viet Nam. Romero was also drawing from his fascination with 1950's sci-fi themes regarding irresponsible science. Unfortunately the best aspect of "Night of the Living Dead", its simplicity, is sacrificed as Romero has just enough resources to turn the film into an exercise in excess. There are several tangential plot points (voice recognition systems, a B-52 with a nuclear warhead, a frustrated scientist) that go nowhere but use up a lot of time getting there.But these obvious problems are not the film's ultimate downfall. That comes from the film's lack of organization on the most fundamental level; which means it is extremely boring. No suspense is generated because there is no sense of progress or advancement of the storyline. Instead the same three basic scenes are repeated over and over until Romero is able to cobble together a feature length production. There are a handful of civilians trying to evade the Army troops, there are a handful of Army officers whining about how difficult their job is, and there are a handful of national security advisers back in Washington tossing around doom and gloom predictions. The film simply alternates between these three groups, with the segments completely interchangeable. The editor could have assembled them in any order and they would have not altered the flow of the story. There are a couple of unexpectedly stylish scenes to watch for; the shooting of the flower child girl in the pasture, with a flock of sheep passing quietly in the foreground. And the infected woman with a broom sweeping the grass. Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child.</fullReview>

No choose what압 better... But there압 even more than that, because without "The Crazies" Romero압 mega classic "Dawn of the Dead" would not have been possible! Both films are connected with lots of parallels, DOTD is a consequent development from the basics this movie delivered!

		<shortDescription>Unrelenting Horror At Its Most Intensely Powerful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this is a motion picture very much of its era, it is still one of the finest cautionary tales ever filmed regarding the threat of biological warfare and the terror of an unknown rampaging virus. Director George Romero uses his camera in a scalpel-like manner as he shocks the audience out of their senses and brings the unholy horror to life in graphic detail. This is truly a nearly brilliant movie that is bound to chill your very blood as the characters portrayed superbly by a gifted cast face one of human kind's most seminal fears: contagion spreading like wildfire. Not only one of the greatest horror films ever made and a Romero masterpiece, The Crazies retains its power even all these years after its original production. Unrelenting suspense, unforgettable imagery, and stunning fear. These are only a few of the elements that will assault you as you become engulfed by the breathtaking horror that is The Crazies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A plane carrying a biological weapon crashes near a small Pennsylvania town. The weapon is a virus that drives people insane. The military quickly moves in and sets up martial law, preventing anyone from leaving the town. A group of people, including a nurse and her unibrowed boyfriend, try to escape the town before they're infected. But to do so they'll have to evade the military and the crazies.George Romero's first really good movie after Night of the Living Dead is this engrossing low-budget thriller with some creepy moments and surprises. The actors are a mixture of semi-professionals and amateurs. I know Romero went for this approach to add some realism to the movie. Sometimes it works; sometimes it is pretty campy. A lot of these people can't act to save their lives. Most of the movie is people yelling at each other but there is quite a bit of action (of the uncoordinated variety). The '70s aesthetic and rural location shooting is a plus. Definitely worth a look. Also, 2010 remake wasn't half-bad.</fullReview>

Soon the western Pennsylvanian town of Evans City is under quarantine as a highly contagious virus begins to cause the residents to exhibit strange and violent behavior. Meanwhile, the army is faced with chaos and confusion as they try to keep the virus from spreading outside of their control. Now, although I liked the premise of the movie, I must admit that I found most of it to be rather boring. The acting wasn't very good and the scenes didn't flow smoothly from one to the next. In essence, the fact that this was a low-budget production really resonates throughout. And while I typically like movies directed by George A.

		<fullReview>"We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!" - Howard Beale ("Network")This is a review of George Romero's "The Crazies", a horror film released in 1973, and 2010's "The Crazies", a remake directed by Breck Eisner, son of media mogul Michael Eisner.The better of the two, Romero's film sees the US military accidentally releasing a biological weapon into a small town's water supply. This bio-agent turns the town's population into raving, murderous lunatics. As a result, the US government swiftly quarantines the town. Much violence ensues.Romero's film is shapeless, overlong, lacking in tension towards its final act and nowhere as good as his zombie movies. It's also frequently brilliant. It's a mad, hilariously anarchic, politically incorrect mob of a movie, filled with manic energy and many strange passages, some of which were deemed shocking back in the early 1970s. Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove" - Romero borrows Kubrick's all-percussion soundtrack ? and Peter Watkins' "Punishment Park" seem to be the chief influences.Like Romero's zombie movies, "The Crazies" simmers with post-Watergate distrust. Our heroes are government hating Vietnam vets, and much of the film observes as various social institutions (the state, the nuclear family, the church) fester, implode or explode. Significantly, Romero paints contemporary society as being "crazy" long before the bio-agent was released; it was already waiting to discharge. The contaminated water merely shatters civilization's last facades and brings various latent abominations and/or unspoken feelings rushing to the surface. It was always going to happen. Or, as Romero says in interviews, "what's crazy is that it hasn't already occurred."Unsurprisingly, themes of incest and militarism abound. A father has sex with his daughter, priests set themselves on fire (echoing the famous self-immolation photographs of the Vietnam war, in which Buddhist monks set themselves alight), soldiers tear down villages like the Nazis' liquidated ghettos, helicopters echo Vietnam's Hueys, and much of the film paints military and government figureheads as being as mad and irrational as the infected townspeople. Pretty soon it becomes clear that the state's method of treating the madness is itself madness, Romero eradicating the line between infected and the uninfected; they're all crazy, the government mimicking the volatile, violent behavioural patterns of those contaminated. "You can't just push people around like this!" one man yells. But no one listens. Everyone's being pushed.The film's pacing is slowed by various sequences which focus on annoying bureaucrats and fast-talking figureheads. Though grating, Romero's intentions with these scenes are nevertheless correct. State bureaucracy, in which men and women spend as much time fighting each other, red tape and the inefficiency of procedure, is itself virus-like and counter-intuitive; nothing gets done, everyone infected with a kind of bureaucratic madness. Elsewhere scenes show rural idylls and totems of conservative America torn apart by mad patriarchs (the film's opening sequence is "Night of the Living Dead" in microcosm). Hilariously, few people are even given a chance to succumb to the virus; the military kills them more efficiently and rapidly than the virus ever could. One of the film's jokes is that a perfectly functioning military apparatus is far more illogical, bloated and morally messed up than the collapsed, lawless hordes it battles.Fittingly, the name of the film's bio-agent is Trixie, literally "the bringer of joy". On an allegorical level, it is the state's blunders, its inherent violence, which are directly inspiring an almost carnivalesque explosion of public mayhem. The military steps in to violently clamp down on these outbursts, but they're not fast enough. Oppositional groups clash, lock horns and slaughter one another in a mad, incoherent festival which does nothing but destroy any form of potential socio-political progress. An early 70s capitalist order is assaulted, but rather than enabling progressivism in the formation of a new social order, things are only further debilitated and any rational functions necessary for future formations are swiftly put down. The film ends with a pregnant woman dying (and with her the hope of a future), and two rugged men stepping out of the conflict's wreckage. One's an African American, airlifted above the carnage (symbolically outside and above it all), another's a fireman who embodies the adjusted (immunized) man of tomorrow: cynical and a Vietnam vet, but with a traditional love for marriage, servitude and stability (his first lines stress his love for "moderation"). The lyrics "Heaven Help Us" play over the film's closing credits. There are countless parallels between "The Crazies" and Romero's earlier and later films. Two obscure ones: Richard France, who looks like a cross between Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola, plays "men of reason" in both "The Crazies" and "Dawn of the Dead". His character's always warning populaces (Richard's an Orson Welles scholar, his character having many overlaps with Welles' "War of the Worlds" radio-play). Then there's "The Crazies'" plot itself, which echoes Romero's earlier "Season of the Witch", in which the banalities of the bourgeois drive an oppressed housewife's to various subversions and perversions. Released in 2010, Breck Eisner's "The Crazies" removes the politics of Romero's film but largely tells the same tale. It's a safe, clean and sanitised movie; like licking an Ipod while rubbing a credit card on your crotch. Glossy, overproduced, expensive looking and immaculately pressed, the film moves, looks and feels like plastic. While some of its horror moments elicit some thrills, it's mostly all very conventional and clich卜. Still, some of Eisner's changes are interesting. While Romero has officials talking of dropping a nuke on the infected town, Eisner does it for real (encapsulating the film's philosophy: spectacle over politics). Elsewhere he spares the life of a government soldier (who helps our band of rebels), whilst the far more pessimistic Romero outright murders the very same character. 7.5/10 - See 2009's "Carriers", 2011's "Contagion" and 1978's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

Those people need not be dumb but those amongst them who are not dumb would probably rather be fishing.The clumsy way in which the people act in this way is therefore probably nearer to the truth than if the "professionals" had been directed by Steven Spielberg with the proper dramatic music to it all.In other words, this is probably what would have happened in the real world if it happened. The James Bonds and Bournes and whatnot are fantasy. An intelligent man would never become a paid assassin, maybe an unpaid one working against government but never one working for it. This includes those who start out working for the government and then blow the whistle because of their (still) unconquered intelligence.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the remake of this. I hope it has a bit more verisimilitude (I love to sneak that word in). This is one of those films where people deliver lines a bit like Romero's zombies. There is so much pain in the situation thrust upon them, and we are to believe that our society would be as indifferent and cruel as they are presented here. Everyone is afraid of panic. Yes, panic is not a good thing, but it is traded for a group of townspeople thrust into a horror story, not understanding what is going on. Obviously, this premise rides along on the fact that there was never a contingency for what takes place and so the army and its counterparts don't have a clue how to handle things. Thank God these people aren't like this in war or we'd be goose stepping to this day. So, while it's entertaining, don't think too much. It's a caricature B movie. But that's what this director is best at.</fullReview>

His original 'Dead' trilogy (there went on to be three additional (read: optional) instalments beginning in 2005) 'Night of the Living Dead' (1968), 'Dawn of the Dead' (1978), and 'Day of the Dead' (1985) essentially created the modern zombie apocalypse template. 'The Crazies', while certainly coming from the same cocktail shaker as these movies with its mix of unthinking killers, rampant destruction, bloody violence, and a good dose of social commentary nonetheless cuts a slightly different stride to its illustrious predecessor or the subsequent carnage-ridden affairs that followed.When the inhabitants of a small town in Western Pennsylvania are exposed to a virus through their local water supply and begin turning into homicidal maniacs the army duly turn up, call martial law, and quarantine the town. We soon learn that the army knows all-too-well the extent of the hazard they are facing as the virus, known as 'Trixie', was designed by the military as an experiment in germ warfare and was accidentally released into the town when an army aircraft crashed nearby. For the alert (read: pedantic) zombie-phile, this is enough to rule the movie out of deserving the "zombie" tag as the victims are not re-animated corpses but the very alive victims of a disease with no known cure. Nevertheless, the threat the infected / zombies pose means that the soldiers have been ordered to take no chances and, as panic escalates to fever-pitch, the soldiers fail to distinguish between psychotic symptoms of the disease and justified hysterical fear for one's (uninfected) life?which in turn unceremoniously erases the line separating the soldiers from the unthinking killers they are trying to contain.As with the 'Dead' films, Romero's focus is on characters amidst the chaos and the film follows a small band of townspeople trying to escape the quarantine and the tangible threat of the military as well as the intangible threat of possible contagion from a disease they know nothing about. The cast are largely inexperienced and while the acting is competent, in parts it comes across as a bit wooden and crucially detracts somewhat from the potential pathos as the movie builds to its climax. However, for horror connoisseurs it's cool to spot Lynn Lowry, who plays Kathy, who would go on to be directed by David Cronenberg in his psycho-sexual parasite horror 'Shivers' two years later. In addition, Kathy's father in the film is played by Richard Liberty, who would go on to put in a memorable performance as Dr "Frankenstein" Logan in 'Day of the Dead' more than a decade later.In addition to some patchy-but-passable acting, the film's real Achilles heel is that it's a high budget idea trapped within the constraints of a low budget, in contrast to 'Night of the Living Dead' which was a low budget idea and worked easily within such confines. As such, many of the locations and action sequences seem to struggle and the film is lucky that it can rest on some interesting ideas and the talent of its director. However, saying this, things do seem to come together towards the end and work up to a denouement with a fair amount of pathos?it's just tempting to suggest that if Romero had made the film later in his career with more money at his disposal the film would have carried a much harder punch than it does in actuality. For Romero fans its arguably a must-see, but for the less dedicated movie-goer the 2010 remake, or even better '28 Days Later' or (in my opinion, the superior) '28 Weeks Later' may be more rewarding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As a film it's crude, as an idea it has to be crude--raw desperation and fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies (1973)A fairly creaky but still chilling movie, and a cult classic, with an original big-government bad-army premise that must have been frighteningly real at the time: a germ warfare mishap has infected a town and the army has moved in to quarantine the entire area. And kill or let die anyone not cooperating.The powerlessness of the individual against an army determined to be heartless (out of necessity) is a theme that worked then as well as now. But if there is some sympathy for the individual doctors and army personnel, since they are doing what needs to be done to prevent further outbreak, you can only feel growing anger that this kind of situation could actually happen. If bio-weapons exist, it seems eventually one will be released by mistake, and then what? Will it be like the Japanese nuke plant after a tsunami, where evacuations and appropriations are "required" in the name of national security. And is the solution to bio warfare the dropping of an atomic bomb? Maybe.That's at the core of this film. There is of course a couple at the center of the struggle to evade the authorities and survive. And infighting, questions of who to trust, how to figure out who is infected (going back to "Invasion of the Body Snatchers," of course), and fear of infection itself pepper the film with drama and sometimes incredulity. There is also the hope of finding someone immune to the disease, which turns out to be slim, especially when the real cures get obscured by events.All of this would work better with better acting. Director George Romero got away with some raw and imperfect acting in his very original "Night of the Living Dead" in 1968, but that was partly because everyone was either panicked or behaving like a zombie (there were, for sure, a couple great leads in that one). Here, though, most people are ordinary folk, and between their clunky acting and the even more clunky filming (in raw color), it just smells too much of a throw-together affair. Too bad, because the premise is terrific. There are other movies that push this kind of idea, by the way, and push it better, the most famous probably being "The Andromeda Strain" from 1971. However, if this kind of rough-edged production doesn't bother you, I think you have a kind of low-brow high-brow classic, appealing to all kinds of sentiments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails as a Horror film and a social commentary.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna go out on a limb here, and say the remake did this better. It's not that I want a movie to be full of action, it's just it's full of nothing but boring dialog. The characters are selfish and the acting consists of an amateurish style, that wears out its welcome quickly. Romero has given us some dandies. "Dawn Of The Dead" "Night Of The Living Dead", hell even Day Of The Dead was good, but this doesn't rank among them. The gore level is pretty tame as well. The only blood that you'll see flow freely here, is some messy gun-shot type stuff, and it looks like red paint most of the time. I know this was directed to be an act as a social commentary of sorts, but it even fails in that regard. I didn't feel anything after this movie was over, in fact I was relieved I didn't have to watch any more of it. The most effective sequence in the movie, by far is the beginning. Chilling stuff.The Performances are all amateurish, and not really worth going over.Bottom line. I was going to say this is worth a look for curiosity's sake, but even that is pushing it. Stick to Romero's better works.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic reign of mild terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero must have a great deal of satisfaction in permitting Hollywood studios remake his movies. He filmed The Crazies in 1973 for only $275,000, which wasn't a lot of money even then. Now he can sit back and make redundant Dead films or plagiarize himself with modern versions of the films nobody wanted to see in the first place. This particular one did poorly at the box office, yet is now on Blu-ray to cash in on the recent release of its remake.Let me admit that this only my fourth Romero film (following Night, Dawn, and Day). And I've the same bland pleasure from all of them. They aren't internally boring, but I find it impossible to really enjoy them. Romero has an idea for a movie and builds the entire production around it. Once you very quickly realize what's going on, the movie becomes a set of gags until it ends. Romero removed the flesh eaters from this movie, which is like distilling a version of any of his genre films. Even modern Dead homage films are more worth watching than this one from the original master.The Crazies is stylistically similar to his zombie trilogy, save the scenery. Instead of depicting another metaphor to accompany his obvious dislike of human-to-human violence, the situation here invokes only his primal feelings. A virus designed to destabilize civilian populations has been mistakenly unleashed into the water supply of a small town. Government officials arrive and immediately quarantine the entire area. People are rounded up and locked in a high school or shot in the streets. One man is immune to the virus and attempts to flee with his girlfriend and some others. All of his compatriots die and he surrenders to the military. The government officers receive word to take measures to stabilize another town and leave the area in chaos.There is occasionally a base entertainment to it that shines through its modest budget. The battle sequences between the military and the heroes are executed well enough to make you think you are watching another movie. Its silent moments are its worst parts. Romero was apparently forced to rewrite the script to focus on the government/military side in order to receive funding. The movie puts way too much time into building its tired theme by showing us the bad things the people we don't like are doing. It's an entirely forgettable film of a notable director that has become inevitable fodder for Hollywood zombies eager to shove mediocrity in our high-definition disc players. The remake is better.

		<fullReview>I started to watch The Crazies thinking it would be a decent flick. After all, George A. Romero's 'Dead' movies have all been quite enjoyable and knowing before hand that this film was about a virus making people go nuts so i thought this wouldn't be a waste of my time. WRONG! This movie is so bad that it put me in a catatonic state for nearly an hour. All it is is a bunch of people going around killing army guys. The confusing thing is that there is hardly any difference between those infected and those not. Ten normal looking people running through a field with guns and a broom doesn't make this a scary or intriguing film but one that made me want to clean my bedroom. There is no thrills or that much detail. It's basically a cross between Outbreak and Rabid and i hate to associate these movies with The Crazies because they were pretty good. Also similar to 28 Days Later but that was a great movie too so how can a highly contagious virus movie suck? Why are there a group of sane people killing army guys? Why don't the infected act crazy instead of just slightly agitated? If you like bad bland movies with very poor structure then this is unmissable but if you don't then go watch the movies i've already mentioned! 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film's story and plot is imaginative, however it over all is a poorly acted and scripted film. Romero deserves credit for his work, however he needs to stop and not be in so many places at once. Much like George Lucas, he needs to produce his work, and never direct it.My biggest complaint is the grossly inaccurate military use in the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This low budget zombie-esque film is a complete waste of time, I rented it thinking that it would at least have some frightening moments but what I got instead was a test in patience. The details concern a toxic agent released by some dumb witted morons in the army in a small town and soon everyone gets the disease. The military, or what appears like extras in cheap army clothing, start to order martial law except a few hot headed guys break out. Each time the military is shown on the screen, Romero has some corny drum beating like we are too stupid to figure out that the army is there.

		<shortDescription>Nothing to get excited about, rather amateurish &amp; boring.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies is set in a small Pennsylvanian town called Evans City. The film starts with with a man having killed his wife setting fire to his house for no apparent reason. Major Ryder (Harry Spillman) of the United States Army and his men have arrived in Evans City after a recent plane crash. The plane crashed into a river that supplies the town's water, on-board the plane was a man made virus called Trixie. The military believe that the residents of Evans City may be infected with a disease that turns the sufferer into a crazie, people who commit random acts of violence &amp; are generally unpleasant to be around. Major Ryder takes over the local Doctors, Dr. Brookmyer (Will Disney), surgery and prepares his plan of action. His men form a perimeter around Evans City, no one gets in or out. His men are then ordered to round all the residents up and take them to the high school. Soon an even more high ranking officer Colonel Peckhem (Lloyd Hollar) arrives to take charge, as well as Dr. Watts (Richard France) who was part of the team who originally developed Trixie to try and find a cure for the disease. The military think they have the situation under control but five people have escaped their round-up, Dr. Bookmyer's nurse named Judy (Lane Carroll) &amp; her fireman husband David (Will MacMillan) &amp; his workmate Clank (Harold Wayne Jones), Artie (Richard Liberty) &amp; his daughter Kathy Bolman (Lynn Lowry) &amp; Frank Winson (Norman Chase) most of whom are convinced that they would be better off as far from Evans City as possible. Will they make it out &amp; are they infected? Can Colonel Peckham keep the situation quiet, prevent the disease from spreading outside Evans City and resolve the crisis before unthinkably drastic action is taken?Written &amp; directed by George A. Romero I really disliked this poor excuse for a film. The script by Romero is about as dull and slow as you can imagine. The film itself is too long and just plain boring, although I did like the last 10 or 15 minutes &amp; the downbeat ending. The Crazies also has a lot of similarities with Romero's infinitely superior Dawn of the Dead (1978), the female lead being pregnant, a fight against inhuman faceless enemies (all the soldiers wear gas masks), the lone survivors who question whether they should stay or leave &amp; a degeneration into petty squabbling and in-fighting. All the characters are very unlikable too, both military and civilian. The fact that the acting is poor throughout doesn't help things either. The violence &amp; gore is non-existent, there are some gunshot wounds, that's it. Overall the film is very rough on a technical level and becomes a real chore to watch. I had heard very good things about the Crazies, but I just can't see anything in it even remotely enjoyable. Maybe I was expecting too much but having Romero's name on the credits as director gave me high expectations that weren't met. Anyone familiar with Romero's other horror like Dawn of the Dead, Creepsow (1982), Martin (1977), Day of the Dead (1985) &amp; expect something similar then prepare to be very disappointed. Proceed with caution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Evans City, a plane crashes on the hill releasing for six days in the water the bacteriological weapon Trixie that affects only human beings. The army under the command of Colonel Peckemseals (Lloyd Hollar) seals off the town to contain the virus and there is no antidote for the victims that are doomed to die or become incurably mad. The pregnant nurse Judy (Lane Carroll), her husband David (W.G. McMillan), their friend Clank (Harold Wayne Jones), their new acquaintance Artie (Richard Liberty) and his daughter Kathy (Lynn Lowry) tries to cross the border of the town, but the escapees are hunted by the army. Meanwhile, the scientist Dr. Ralston Watts (Richard France) researches blood samples trying to find the cure for the disease."The Crazies" is a tale of paranoia and madness in a period when the world was afraid of a bacteriological war. The plot is based on a total stupidity from the authorities that send the army to contain the virus in a small town but does not provide any explanation to the population, invading real estates and breaking in homes. The lead scientist is another stupid character. Surprisingly this year it was released a remake of this average film. Last time I saw this film was on 04 July 2000. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "O Ex本cito do Exterm暗io" ("The Extermination Army")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A dumb zombie film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or "The Stupids", but that would be the movie about the writer(s) of this film. This movie is an insult to the U.S. army and anyone who has ever served in it. I love it when those horror movie directors try to make "statements" and teach us about authority, the military, freedom and so on. (Not that other directors are much more intelligent.) Romero's utter contempt for the U.S. army is written all over this deluded, paranoid vision of the kind of events that arise in an emergency quarantine situation."I can't believe how shoddily this whole operation is being run!" shouts one army guy, and I tend to agree. I agree that a military operation can be run this badly only in the mind of an idiot who hasn't got a clue how the military really handles ANY kind of emergency. "The army is nobody's friend", says a civilian ex-soldier on the lam, and then proceeds to kill about a dozen soldiers, and the viewer is supposed to side with him. Even the town's police force try to rebel, threatening to use force even, and one cop gets shot accidentally as a result. The town's doctor is uncooperative, and the town's mayor is even worse - he's in hysterics over this whole operation. Does everyone in this town hate the army so much? Does Romero really think that there is/was so much hatred of the army in the public that people at all levels, from garbage man to mayor, would refuse to cooperate? And in a small town? Romero must be an idiot. He must have been reading too much hippie literature (if such an oxymoronic thing even exists) or he must be one of those left-wing morons who think that the U.S. government is always looking forward to an opportunity to nuke its own people. Romero would have us believe that top government people are just itching to finally nuke a couple of Americans into orbit.There are MANY ultra-dumb actions and decisions which Romero's military undertakes. For example, the town's entire populace is being dragged out of their homes and gathered into a high school gymnasium. Excuse me, but if some of the inhabitants are infected, and others aren't, then wouldn't it make more sense to leave everyone at home so that the infected ones don't infect the rest? I mean, come on. NO ARMY IN THE WORLD can be this dumb. Except Romero's army, for they are imbeciles. And naturally, this Romero army gathers the townsfolk in a must unpleasant and unfriendly manner. You see, Romero's U.S. army hates civilians and will take any opportunity to make them suffer when they get the chance. Romero's U.S. army isn't even well-trained. They can barely handle civilians, some of whom have never held (semi)automatic rifles in their hands. The way they get bumped off by our duo of ex-berets is simply ridiculous. These two were playing Rambo before Rambo even existed. Just because they are ex-berets we are lead to believe that they are practically invincible. In fact, it's pathetic how Romero wants us to root for the main trio of outlaws, when in fact their actions were being irresponsible, selfish, and driven by panic. Romero would be surprised by this, but I was rooting for the military (even if it was Romero's military, no ordinary military of course) to bump off the trio of runaway idiots. One can almost sense how much Romero enjoyed having so many soldiers killed; more soldiers than civilians seem to get bumped off here.There were other dumb things. For example, the genius-scientist who is sent to help with the crises: this guy said early on that an antidote for the virus is nowhere in sight and that the government had been looking for one in vain for three years already. But then, suddenly, a day or two later, this same guy makes a major breakthrough with finding the antidote! What a COINCIDENCE. And to make things even more absurd, he makes this breakthrough in a hastily assembled lab which lacks the necessary assistants and equipment that he normally has at his disposal (he complains about the microscope, for example). How idiotic! Actually, the film had potential. The action is good and the premise opens a lot of exciting possibilities for a horror/action film. Unfortunately, Romero's hatred for men in green uniforms has gotten in the way of making a sensible and credible martial-law virus movie. For an intelligent approach to this idea of a virus infection being contained by the government one should look no further than for "Andromeda Strain", even "Outbreak". For a childish, paranoid, and generally silly approach to this theme this film is ideal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early Romero that deserves more attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies was the film where director George Romero returned to similar territory that he had explored in his earlier cult classic Night of the Living Dead (1968). Its story hinges on a bio-chemical warfare virus that accidentally ends up in the water supply of a small town. The unfortunate people who become infected by it turn into homicidal maniacs. Government forces turn up en mass and quarantine the whole area while a small group of scientists attempt to find an antidote.Although this film is nowhere near as well-known as Romero's zombie films, it's one that should really be seen by anybody who appreciates those films. By having the relentless killers people infected by a virus, the film makes the horror just that little bit more plausible. In fact, there is no way to physically tell who is infected or not, which is quite a clever plot element as it creates paranoia amongst the survivors who wonder if erratic behaviour from one of their group could be a symptom of the virus or simply a result of the stressful situation they find themselves in. In this way, along with the heavy-handed tactics of the government men, Romero is able to explore the idea of whether it is the infected or the normal people who are the worse overall danger. This theme is one the director explores in many of his other films but it's perhaps here that it is the most direct; after all, the pandemic is entirely man-made, while one of the solutions offered is to nuke the town. In this sense The Crazies falls into the large group of pessimistic 70's films in which the government are seen to not have the people's best interests at heart. The irony of the fate of the scientist who finds the cure for the virus only emphasises that the priorities and methods of the government men are way off the mark.One thing that might be off-putting to some viewers is the very low budget nature of this movie. I mean it's hardly rock bottom as there are many locations, costumes, sets, etc but it is most certainly technically raw. The sound recording in particular is quite basic and there is no real cinematic gloss to be found anywhere. I have to say though that I think in this instance, these factors sort of work in the film's favour a bit. There is a more realistic feel to events and it makes the scenario feel just that bit grittier and truer to life. Like other Romero's the script is pretty good while he does get some effective performances out of his cast. The most notable being Lynn Lowry of I Drink Your Blood (1970) and Shivers (1975) fame, who plays the fragile young woman who slowly loses her mind; her creepy father is played by Richard Liberty, who would go on to be more well-known as the scientist who teaches Bud the zombie in Romero's later Day of the Dead (1985). But aside from the low-key guerrilla style, there are also some pretty memorable horror moments too such as the kindly old woman who calmly stabs a soldier repeatedly with a knitting needle, the girl who insanely sweeps up the dead with a broom and the priest who sets himself alight. On the whole, I have a lot of time for this movie and it's one that I find gets better every time I re-watch it. It's definitely another example of the intelligent approach that Romero is rightly famous for bringing to the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outbreak thriller is one of Romero's best outside of his Dead trilogy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following in the wake of his pretentious and boring SEASON OF THE WITCH, THE CRAZIES finds director George Romero in familiar territory with this story of a town's folk turned incurably insane through the intervention of a chemical weapon transferred through the town's water supply - a story which has minor conspiracy-theory implications which firmly sets it in the paranoid world of '70s cinema. Right from the arresting opening, in which a father attempts to murder his entire family, Romero's fast-paced movie never lets up, leading us from one scene of bloodshed and chaos to the next with little time to think or breathe. Once again, as with NIGHT OF THE LIVING DADand his following movies, Romero's low budget adds to the gritty realism of the film which makes it a cut above the rest - indeed I feel this is much stronger, and far more affecting stuff than the likes of OUTBREAK and other "disease of the week" thrillers of the '90s.Despite a longer-than-average running time, THE CRAZIES never becomes boring or tired - instead it keeps you gripped throughout until the predictably downbeat conclusion. The film expertly weaves two plot strands - the efforts of a small group of people to survive, and the efforts of the people in charge to contain the outbreak - together into one satisfying whole and the themes and storyline are often impressive. I especially like the way in which the intervention of the soldiers in contamination suits eventually becomes even more dangerous for our survivors than the disease itself, and Romero dots the film with memorable disturbing images - my 'favourite' being when a vicar dowses himself in petrol and burns himself kneeling in front of his church - so that it can easily be classed as a horror film as well as a sci-fi-style thriller.As well as this, THE CRAZIES has a ton of shoot-outs and gun battles to make it watchable for the action-orientated crowd too. The highlight is a tense scene in which a crazed man, Clank, takes on a pack of soldiers in the woods. The film recalls NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in scenes of the soldiers roaming through the countryside, gunning down those that are infected, and the madness back at the army's base in town - with various parties ranting at each other - is a subject Romero returned to with the opening scenes of DAWN OF THE DEAD. The tension is racked up as the film progresses, as our party of survivors who hope to escape gradually dwindles and their chances are repeatedly dashed.The acting is especially strong from the unknown cast, with female lead Lane Carroll particularly affecting as the pregnant mother caught up in the chaos and trying only to escape with her husband. The husband, played by John Saxon-lookalike Will MacMillan, is also a strong and this time heroic character who you end up rooting for. Also memorable are Harold Wayne Jones as 'Clank', the friend who ends up turning crazy himself in memorable style, whilst the various colonels and doctors involved also have strong roles. Fans of Romero's DAY OF THE DEAD may spot Richard Liberty (the Doc) in this film as a family man turned insane, who ends up desiring his beautiful elfin daughter Kathy (Lynn Lowry, who plays Kathy, is tragic and disturbing at the same time). Regular Romero collaborator Bill Hinzman is also in there somewhere too, although I didn't spot him.THE CRAZIES is a strong piece of adult film making which expertly achieves the atmosphere of confusion and chaos that it sets out to put across - a world in which the character's lives are turned upside down and their existence becomes a brutal and often bloody struggle for survival against the overwhelming odds of the US army. Despite it's pessimism and bleakness, this is an entertaining and gripping movie to watch and another feather in the hat for Romero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero takes zombies to a whole new level in The Crazies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero is probably most famous for his 1978 film 'Dawn of the Dead' which was the second in a series of zombie movies which each reflected society at the time. With The Crazies, instead of zombies eating live humans, this movie is more along the lines of I Drink Your Blood (1970) and Warning Sign (1985). Romero creates a disturbing, cautionary story of a virus known as Trixie which turns people from a small town into psychopathic murderers bent on killing everyone in sight, whether it be their husbands, wives, children, neighbors, it quickly becomes a fight for survival, if survival is even possible. Luckily a small number of people are escaping the epidemic, but along the way they lose support from everyone, including the military, which was responsible for engineering the virus in the first place.The Crazies is exciting, non-stop suspense, and unlike horror movies made today, in this movie you actually get attached to the characters and want them to escape the terror, it definitely keeps you watching 'till the end. It has eerie soundtrack, decent acting (Lynn Lowry from I Drink Your Blood is actually in it as well). It has that grainy, nostalgic feel to it because it was filmed back in '73, I miss that look of old films.Once again Romero has made his mark in the horror genre with a movie that is timeless and exciting and creepy all at once. I'd recommend it to any horror fan, it's definitely worth it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was one of the few Romero films I hadn't seen before, and after seeing it I have no idea why I waited so long!This very low budget movie about a town infected with a virus via its water supply has the classic Romero feel, in that the film focuses far more on the people affected than the situation at hand. The acting is not the best you'll ever see, but believable, and you do feel for the characters all the way until the end. The sense of desperation he manages to create is impressive and the film is completely engrossing from start to finish. While perhaps not quite at the height of his Dead trilogy, this is one Romero movie you can't miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You've got to give George Romero points for consistency. No matter what type of film he's making, be it NOTLD or his modern-day vampire tale MARTIN, his message has always been the same: We're our own worst enemies. After completing NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, George and his crew spent the next 5 years trying to get another production off the ground. After making a few forgettable ones, he decided to return to familiar ground. Inspired by a real-life incident, George this time makes an eco-based horror film. A military plane carrying an experimental bio-weapon crashes in a small Pennsylvanian town. The weapon, codenamed Trixie, leaks into the local water supply. Anyone who drinks the contaminated water becomes a homicidal maniac. So the army moves in to quarantine the town until they can decide on a strategy. Meanwhile, two firefighters and a handful of other people try to find a way out of the town. The army sends in squads to locate, destroy and rescue people. However, the townsfolk don't take kindly to their being detained. And that's where the horror works best. Because there's no physical way to tell which people are infected, and which are just reacting from the stressful situation. Though the film is Romero's personal favorite, in my opinion it's a very good movie, but it's not his best. The acting, as always, is excellent from a cast of unknowns. There are plenty of frightening moments. My favorite involves an old woman and a darning needle. However, it seems to lean a little too heavily on showing the authorities as being incompetent. I understand that Romero has his agenda, but please George we don't always need it shoved down our throats. Still, it's a satisfying horror flick that may be a little dated. And if nothing else, it got a superb remake in 2010! Check either of these two out to see eco-terror in action.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero may not be bringing us zombies this time around but he does manage to cover some similar ground in a tale of an "infected" town being taken control of by the military. We are forced to think about who is worse as we see the infected, the possibly infected and the healthy alike all penned in and at the mercy of people with guns. Just what's worse? The actions of those who get sick or the actions of those who are still in the best of health?With a very low budget, nobody who really stands out in the acting stakes, a lot of not-so-special effects and a script that almost loses its more intelligent moments amidst endless scenes of squabbling and impotent frustration (though that IS kind of the point), it's hard to see just why this movie is still recommended amongst horror fans.Perhaps it's the fun of seeing Lynn Lowry on screen. Maybe it's because making the effort to put up with the film's failings actually rewards the viewer with yet another gritty, intelligent horror from Romero. Or maybe it's simply because the main man's name holds so much weight for lovers of the genre.Whatever the reasons, I still rate this film as one with much more potential than the content actually provides. There are one or two highly disturbing sequences and the premise is a good one but it's all rather weakened by the poor acting, repetitive moments and surprising lack of blood.See this if you like: The Crazies, Right At Your Door, Day Of The Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Shortly after his NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD success (Let's not mention the truly boring THERE'S ALWAYS VANILLA &amp; SEASON OF THE WITCH okay?) GEORGE ROMERO helmed this sci-fi horror film about a plague causing people to go berserk &amp; attack others in a small town while the military is called in to try &amp; stop them, unless of course "the crazies" get them first. THE CRAZIES is a film I heard about for many years, but was never able to find a copy until today &amp; while the film has many interesting moments, it overall doesn't remain Romero's best effort, part of the problem with the film is that it's to chatty, not to mention overlong &amp; there are no truly memorable moments in the film to help it stay in memory by the time the DVD stops playing. The acting &amp; directing is pretty decent, if only we could have had a better film. Remade in 2010 under the same name.** stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ The Crazies is indeed an interesting, forgotten Romero flick. I could grow to love this film if only the picture were cleaned up. It's highly similar to Night of the Living Dead, just without the zombies. Our villains here are a man-made virus and very, very human monsters. The military has created a poison that infects the mind and a plane carrying the toxin crashes into the once peaceful town of Evan City. Once it leaks into the water, all hell breaks loose. There are some great, jaw-dropping moments here. Let me describe just a few: An elderly woman sits in her rocking chair, knits, and then for no apparent reason gets up and stabs a man to death with her knitting needles, all while smiling and humming a tune. Amidst a gun fight in a field a young girl walks behind the soldiers sweeping up the dead bodies and carnage with a broom. Finally, a priest leaves his congregation and sets himself on fire. It's truly unsettling stuff and Romero's usual cast of unknowns does fine with the downbeat material and witty social commentary. It's an upsetting film that doesn't have a happy ending-and the tone from the beginning tells you this. The Crazies turns out to be just that: Crazy. Whatever you do, don't drink the water. Note to genre buffs: You may recognize Richard Liberty, he's Dr. Logan/Frankenstein from Day of the Dead, another Romero classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While you could dismiss this as just another Romero zombie flick, let me tell you this: it isn't! Of course that doesn't mean, that you will like it or even that the Remake will make you want to watch this. And of course the stringent budget does affect the shooting. But I think they did not only do their best with the money, but Romero went all out with the "documentary" feel.The basic idea stays the same (as is shown in the Remake too) and has been done quite a few times. Some have said, that this movie was ahead of its time and maybe it was, but that is not the point. It's how you feel about the movie and the message (you might feel it's too preachy, too slow or lacking in other categories). Or you might think it's a classic (although I do think that word has been overused). But you will know after the first few minutes, because like it or not, it stays true to the style and visual it sets out to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Social Commentary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've been reading enough of my reviews, you're familiar with Romero's work and wonderful contribution to the genre. If you're not...I'll inform you in short. In 1968 George Romero created a new kind of zombie with Night of the Living Dead...one that would revolutionize the concept of the walking dead and influence many film makers in the coming ages of horror. He managed to beautifully blend action, horror, suspense, and a study guide on human behavior. Although it's true that zombies have existed in literature and film since their inception, Romero's vision transformed the myth into a more tangible representation. People who've learned to delve deeper in the genre than I could probably argue that if it wasn't for *insert obscure German expressionist film maker here* then Romero wouldn't have a template to work from, but in terms of mainstream media, Romero is THE godfather of zombie cinema that we know and love today. 1978's Dawn of the Dead and 1985's Day of the Dead took things further and are widely regarded as classics in their own right. I may as well state once more that Day of the Dead is the best zombie movie ever made...hands down. While the effects of today are nice, I don't care how far advanced CGI techniques have progressed in the last 20 years when comparing it to his older work. He's taken several hiatuses from zombie cinema through his career with titles such as 1993's The Dark Half, based on a Stephen King novel, and the classic 1982 anthology Creepshow (a collaboration between Romero and King himself!). He even declined an offer to direct the absolute FAILURE I call Resident Evil - he later reconsidered and wrote a script for the film but it was rejected. If I wasn't such a model citizen I'd punch someone in the face for that injustice. As a result, Romero returned to reclaim his dominance with 2005's Land of the Dead, followed up by Diary of the Dead in 2007.The Crazies was Romero's third film and bears a striking resemblance to existing titles in his filmography. The premise is about the accidental release of a biological weapon that infects the inhabitants of a small town. Eventually the townsfolk are driven mad and a task force is set up to quarantine the perimeter. Now that you know the gist of the tale, let's break it down.? The film is set in Evans, Pennsylvania. Romero was born in New York City, NY and I'm sure a fan of the area. Even Dawn of the Dead was filmed in Monroeville, PA (although I'm fairly certain they claimed it was Philadelphia in the movie). I'm from PA and never heard of either of these two places. Then again, I rarely know where I am.? Apocalyptic conditions...military and government involvement...knit-picking domestic policy...human behavioral studies through cinematic expression...it sounds a bit worn out doesn't it? This was 1973 and even though the plot isn't all that original by today's standards, it was back then. ? There are many sub-plots that exist in the film but I didn't care for any of them. Out of the Romero movies that I've seen, this is the weakest link. It's a fact that his genius in terms of directing ability was mostly limited to B-rated productions...and that's fine because he never set out to be a mainstream Hollywood director in the first place. I certainly think he gained a huge following that will never die. However, I won't be blinded by favoritism when I say this movie sucks.? On the topic of my dislike for the film, it's not a very elaborate one. The acting was lousy and the effects weren't all that impressive (given Romero's frequent collaboration with special effects genius Tom Savini - unfortunately this communion didn't formulate until 1977, missing the mark by 4 years). The story line dragged on. I managed to painfully watch the entire feature in increments because it failed to captivate my interest that much.Final Verdict: The Crazies is a boring, unimaginative, poorly-acted, badly lit, slappdashery habberdash of craptasticness that's only suitable for background filler while you're doing house chores. Romero fans might learn of my disloyalty and string me up to the town belfry but I'll remain steadfast in my opinion. I'll go on record to say that the remake of this film wasn't much better, just spruced up "Hollywood" style to appeal to action-driven, low-tiered patrons who love to watch stuff blow up, even if it is at Romero's expense.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never thought I would use the word boring in relation to a Romero film. However this film lacks everything. Most reviews rate this film as being a low budget classic, but I see it as being a low budget joke. It makes no sense at all. David is a boring protagonist and the soldiers are laughable. The only interesting part of the film is when David hides Jane among the cinder blocks, and she goes crazy. It would have worked better as a 10 minute short, based completely around that scene. I did enjoy David talking through the gas mask to confuse the enemy, but thats it. The whole film just resembles stock footage of people shooting into the distance. Watch the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Above average paranoia thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who doesn't love a good paranoia thriller? You know the kind about an outbreak of a virus, or an impending nuclear attack, or some form of mass hysteria. These kind of films were a big thing in the 1970s and who better to make one than 'Dead' series creator George Romero? In between his first and second films in said series he made this film, a low budget Thriller about the outbreak of a virus in a small town and the frightening effect it has. How does the film hold up today? Well, this was my first viewing of the film and since I am curious to see the upcoming remake I had to check out the original and though I like it quite a bit, some aspects of it haven't aged terribly well.Pros: Performances are good. As usual Romero injects his script with intelligence and some good social commentary. He also does a great job at creating suspense. Nice cinematography. Perfectly paced. Some great moments of intensity. Many good chills throughout.Cons: Hasn't aged too well. A bland and mostly repetitive score. Too many characters to keep track of. At times too talky.Final thoughts: It's interesting to see what films considered to be great in their time hold up well decades later and which don't. 'The Crazies' is a rather dated film and maybe not as relevant now as it was at the time in terms of it's commentary, but that doesn't change the fact that it's an enjoyable and thrilling experience. Worth a look.My rating: 3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Confusion, panic, desperation, hopelessness: George Romero's The Crazies not only employs the same dynamic as his 1979 classic Dawn of the Dead, but also has a similar style and pacing, making it an interesting companion piece to the director's long running zombie series. Technically, the film might lack the polish of Romero's later work (the editing, in particular, ain't that great), and it is perhaps a bit too talkative at times, but for fans of the Pittsburgh auteur, it should still be considered a 'must-see' movie.As in Dawn of the Dead, society is facing collapse in the wake of a deadly epidemic that has been caused by the accidental release of a biological weapon; however in this film, the result of the contagion is not a plague of flesh-eating corpses, but rather a madness that can cause victims to commit sudden acts of violence.Whilst the army struggles to cover up their mistake and prevent further contamination, and a lone scientist (Dawn of the Dead's Richard France) attempts to formulate a vaccine, two firefighters (Will MacMillan and Harold Wayne Jones) try to lead a small group of people (including Day of the Dead's Richard Liberty and cult actress Lynn Lowry) to safety, with the biggest threat coming from the ominous, trigger-happy, HazMat-suited soldiers roaming the countryside.Once again Romero cleverly combines political commentary with visceral action, delivering an intelligent horror that not only provides excitement, tension, splatter, and a delightfully downbeat ending, but also something for the mind to chew over: although seeing a seemingly meek, old woman stabbing a soldier to death with her knitting needles is undeniably shocking, the real horror comes from the distinct possibility of such a situation occurring, and the extreme procedures implemented by the government following the outbreak, which include having a bomber with a nuclear payload circling the area in preparation for the worst eventuality (interestingly, the same 'last resort' was used to contain the zombie outbreak in the excellent 1985 comedy/horror Return of the Living Dead, a film inextricably linked to Romero's work).7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for IMDb.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Example of Creative Film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early film of George Romero is about a small town in Pennsylvania that is infected by a virus created by the U.S. Army. The virus produces one of two results; violent rage or a dementia like state. We initially see the violent side as the film opens with a man killing his wife and burning down his home. The military acts quickly in an effort to quarantine the town and prevent the spread of the virus. This goes fairly smoothly at first, with the residents cooperating as the soldiers herd the townsfolk into the school gymnasium. Problems arise, as the infection prompts many residents to shoot the soldiers. And, of course, the soldiers shoot back. At the army command center, a local doctors office, no one can quite agree on the proper course of action to take. There are even some scenes with the higher ups in Washington, DC gravely agreeing that, if need be, the town will be destroyed via bombardment. The main crux of the story centers on a small group of townspeople who decide to try and break out of the quarantine and are pursued by government forces. The group consists of David, an ex Green Beret and his pregnant wife, Judy, followed by Clank, an old army buddy, and Artie and Kathy Bolman, father and daughter. Things go from bad to worse as some members in the group exhibit signs of the virus and the film follows on from there.This was Romero's third film, and he made it before his first film, Night of the Living Dead, was to make him a horror legend. The Crazies is similar to Dead in many ways, it was shot in Pennsylvania, centers on an invading "army," and the chaotic breakdown of society.The Crazies is definitely a cheapie. Romero would be the first to admit that. However, the film is effective in its execution despite its low budget. There is a clear storyline and the film is competently shot. The acting ranges from awful to convincing and Romero relied on stock footage and cut-aways to keep the movie rolling. To me, the editing seems choppy and appears as if the director, who also edited the film amongst other duties, was attempting to salvage some scenes. Oddly, this enhances The Crazies charm. It is truly a low budget film and illustrates what a creative spirit and some teamwork can achieve. It is watchable and a perfect example of how films got done back in the 70s without studio support. I really believe this is the glory years of independent movies especially as it pertains to the horror genre. Also, amazingly, these folks, Craven, Romero all had to shoot and edit with film. There were no fancy digital cameras and Final Cut Pros back then, just creativity. It makes me wonder why we aren't seeing more gems from today's filmmaker. Unfortunately, I just haven't seen any real leap with all the opportunity that is out there with this new equipment and I've seen A LOT of low budget films. Anyway, I digress.Some of the aspects of The Crazies that I don't think work so well were in some of Romero's directorial choices. As he was to later employ to ill effect in Day of the Dead, Romero seems to think that having characters simply shout at each other is enough to illustrate drama. The scenes at the military headquarters are the best examples of this. I realize the characters are supposed to be handling a crisis, but, at times, it appeared that they could communicate by no other means then yelling. It got very wearing.Also, ineffective and wearing was the drum roll music used throughout the film for scenes that involved the military on the move, which was most of the movie. It sounded a little too cheap and since it was repeated so often became distracting.The costumes the soldiers wore were white biological warfare type gowns with army issue gas masks. For the budget Romero had, these were perfectly acceptable and worked. However, not the filmmakers fault, but I couldn't help but think of the white clad storm troopers from the Star Wars series and not just in resemblance. The soldiers were about as effective as the buffoonish space soldiers in shooting and chasing after the renegade townspeople. I imagine this was Romero's own view of the American army as there are also many scenes of the soldiers stealing.As a film, on its own, The Crazies isn't the greatest film you'll see, even in it's genre, but it is often engaging and with the right nostalgic frame of mind entertaining. It's chief value, so many years later though, is its illustration of an early filmmakers creativity and independent spirit.George Romero, as he did with many of his other early films, got the money together and went out and, for better or worse, got it done.There is a lot to learn and appreciate from that.</fullReview>

"Trixie" the virus drives people insane. The townspeople become "The Crazies". Or is the military "The Crazies"? Am I crazy for buying this DVD?"The Crazies" is a well made film. Unfortunately, it is far too ambitious for its budget. It wanted it all: Nuclear weapons, town quarantine, army divisions, mass riots, and general craziness all on a shoestring budget. It was cheap and it showed. It tried its best but in the end it was unsatisfying. It's the kind of flick where if a helicopter goes down, you'll see it fly out of sight and then a puff of smoke will rise to simulate a crash landing. It had a few decent gore effects but not enough to save it.But what really disappointed me about this movie was how not crazy "The Crazies" were. If everyone affected by the virus had become a homicidal maniac then I might have been satisfied. But the virus affected people in different ways. Very lame ways. Take Lynn Lowry's character. When the crazy virus attacked her, it released her inner flower child. She wasn't really crazy. It was more like she was high. She should have been lunging for the army men's throats; not skipping along the grass to her doom."The Crazies" is a well directed thriller but too cheap and too tame to be really worthwhile. It needed an injection of cash and carnage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Possible minor spoilers.Originally a box-office disappointment, The Crazies is finally beginning to get some of the respect it deserves. A violent, emotional, deeply personal outcry against the senselessness of the Vietnam War and other atrocities, it deals with horrors that seem all too possible.The setting is Evans City, Pennsylvania, where a governmentally-developed chemical known as "Trixie" has contaminated the water supply and turned citizens into unbalanced nuts. Soon the military invades the town and declares martial law, turning out to be an even bigger threat than the "crazies" of the title. Confused and defensive, some of the Evans City residents rebel and are often shot to death for their trouble. Five people steal a van and attempt escape. But it's never quite as simple as you'd think, with fully-rounded characters and such a sense of and panicked immediacy that all you can do is watch as the situation becomes more dire with every passing minute.George Romero delivers a turbulent, unpolished piece of cinema that proves both entertaining and highly thought-provoking in its downbeat societal critique. It's a cautionary tale that warns us that we'd better get it together soon, before this hell becomes our reality. We are asked, Why does it have to be this way? Are we so screwed up as a society that it has to come to this? The sad, haunting theme song, "Heaven Help Us," written by Melissa Manchester and Carole Bayer Sager and sung by Beverly Bremers, rams home the concept, begging us to consider what we're doing to each other.The acting is terrific, particularly Lynn Lowry as a repressed teenage girl who finally lashes out. The characters are given depth and believability, and you can't help but feel sad and helpless in the face of the unfolding events. Very well paced, with lots of startling, sometimes gory, visuals, all presented in a cinema verite manner that makes them even more bleak and unsettling. An enthralling study of panic and authoritarian domination, I have no doubt that The Crazies is a very important film. This is our society. Heaven help us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't often really get inspired to write a review, but this film did it for me. I was shocked at the positive nature of most of the other comments here, so I felt the need to write a warning against watching this piece of insipid trash. Now, I'm a huge fan of Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead, and George Romero has definitely had points of near-genius; but when he's bad, well, he's just about un-watchable. Take this film for example: it has no sense of pacing, the acting stinks, the print quality (on the video I watched, anyway) is poor, there are no likeable characters and little gore - in short, this is just an ill-thought-out brainfart that I'm shocked ever made it onto film. The scope of the film is way too wide, giving the viewer no chance to connect with individual characters. And it has no sense of context. All of a sudden, buildings catch on fire, people get shot or go insane - and the question I'm left with is simply this: why? It's hard to be affected by all the chaos and violence when there's nothing to connect it together. It's been said before and I'll say it again: stay far, far away from this steaming, smelly dung heap of a poor excuse for half a horror film.</fullReview>

But this movie came AFTER his low budget landmark "Night of the Living Dean," so maybe we should call this one a flub, plain and simple. The idea is good--and has been redone in later, slicker and slightly better films such as Outbreak, Warning Sign and Impulse (the Meg Tilly movie, not the Theresa Russell one). Actually "The Crazies" has more in common with an Ed Wood production--the hysterical, awful acting; the cardboard, dated characters (one character keeps using the word "MAN" before and after every sentence--he's a Vietnam vet, you see); horrible (and I mean HORRIBLE) sound effects (the spring peeper frogs actually drown out the dialogue in many scenes); over-the-top direction; and ketchup for blood (well, it was filmed in Pittsburgh--maybe Romero had a deal with Heinz). I wouldn't even watch this movie for laughs. I will repeat--this movie is bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Impressive Early George Romero Horror-Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An accidental plane crash causes a government-engineered virus codenamed Trixie to be released into the water supply of a small Pennsylvania town. The military quarantine the town and struggle to contain the population, many of whom have been driven crazy from exposure to the infection.This early Romero low-budget epic shares many of the virtues of his more famous zombie trilogy - terrific editing, a grimly realistic portrayal of anarchy, impotent authority figures, tragedy on both a grand and an intimate scale - and its subject-matter (biological weapons) is as potent a theme today as it was when it was made. The likable cast are mostly unknowns, but Hollar and France in particular are excellent as the expendable colonel in charge of the asylum and the bad-tempered scientist who manages to find a cure, only to be mistaken for an escapee and promptly shot. Lowry and Liberty are also both bonafide cult stars, the former from David Cronenberg's classic They Came From Within, and the latter in Romero's Day Of The Dead. The film is a tremendous achievement for a shoestring production; compared with something like Wolfgang Petersen's fun-but-very-dumb Outbreak, it is a tremendously tense and evocative depiction of misanthropy and paranoia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheap but effective... (SPOILERS!)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I liked the most about "The Crazies" was that the film had the same vibe as the British alternate history film "It Happened Here": both are claustrophobic, gritty films where there are no real heroes or villians, just people thrown into situations beyond their control. In "IHH" the antagonist is Fascism, which is said to spread like a virus or incubate like a germ in ordinary people, while in "The Crazies" the enemy actually is a germ (code-named "Trixie" and made by the US government) which spreads through the water system of a small Pennsylvania town. The only difference is that Trixie's release was accidental. While "The Crazies" is very similar to Romero's previous "Night of the Living Dead", it displays a far greater pessimism about the future of humanity as the entire populace of Evans City, Pennsylvania either dies in gun battles with US Army troops (decked out in creepy gasmasks and white hazmat suits, by the way) or goes saliva-bubbling mad. If you thought "The Day After" was fun, this may be the film for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and chilling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely a cult movie.The opening with the two children is frightening when they observe the deranged man thrashing the downstairs of the house. It is interesting to note the paranoia the military creates by simply closing off the town and placing the area under martial law. The threat of the virus in something as simple as water adds to the realism and horror for the group attempting to escape (and drinking the water along the way!).It's a typical Romero film (even though it is only his second movie made!). Lots of scares, blood and shock - especially the granny with the knitting needles. It may be about 25 years old now, but it is still a good horror flick. Don't watch it alone or the Crazies may come for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally, A Horror Movie That DOES Need To Be Remade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero is a horror master. There is little masterful, however, about this film. To his credit, he didn't have full control over this production, as he does is some of his later masterpieces. While the basic premise of this film is great, "The Crazies" never really gets off the ground. The film is sold to us, promising to deliver crazy infected people, but instead we're forced to watch "normal" non-infected humans battle the Army..... Not cool....The movie doesn't even try to get off the ground for the first hour, besides the disturbing introduction. We're treated to lots of talking for the first hour, I mean A LOT of talking. In fact the first hour seems to have been devoted to the Army Brass talking about perimeters. We hear the same basic lines over and over and over. When the action finally gets going, there are few crazies to be found anywhere, just stupid rednecks fighting for their lives. Let the Army kill rednecks, who cares?There are few redeeming qualities about this picture. Too much talking, too many main characters whom we care nothing for and not enough crazies. If your a Romero fan, I recommend you see this film just for kicks. If your not a Romero fan stay away. And to the people that gave this film more than seven stars, get a clue... There's nothing deep or meaningful about this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capable but flawed thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acclaimed early thriller from Romero portraying a desperate group caught in a town under martial law after a chemical outbreak.'The Crazies' (U.K. title) plot is an interesting one, but despite a talented (yet relatively unknown) cast, Romero's handling is a little off-track. The film is very choppy and the directors satire of the U.S. Army hardly helps the movie, and is ultimately lost in the final erratic package. On the plus side the film does run at a fair pace and the tension is maintained throughout. It appears the film seems almost a test-run for the altogether more polished (and fun!) 'Dawn of the Dead.' that Romero would make a few years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Romero drops us right in the middle of a terrifying situation..a small town in Pennsylvania where the Army, bio-chemical suits, seize upon the citizens for inoculation and isolation, declaring Martial Law, quarantining it off from the rest of the continent. A small group of locals, however, attempt to escape this quarantine. A biological virus, named Trixie, created by our own scientists as a weapon for the military, has been accidentally unleashed on the town because of a plane crash causing the chemical to enter the water supply, infecting anyone who drank from it. In turn, the virus causes delirium and hysteria, turning normally rational thinking human beings into raving violent lunatics. As the military attempts to contain and localize the outbreak, the crazed community often inflict serious damage, with chaos reigning and psychopathic behavior of an extreme nature breaking out. It's easy to see that the military and our own government were not prepared for such a dilemma as we watch them bickering amongst themselves, trying to coordinate a efficient plan as troubles and trials overwhelm them. The locals are gathered up(Romero shows families' homes intruded upon, plucked from their sanctuary, and moved into the high school as if cattle placed in a pen. A scientist, Dr. Watts(Romero regular Richard France), is brought, pretty much against his will, to the town because of his expertise(he also helped create the bacteriological virus)to work on a possible antidote. Angst, tension, and anxiety cause unneeded stress as Watts informs all among him that a treatment for the infectious syndrome plaguing the folks is highly unlikely. Can the perimeter hold? Will our government bombard the town and it's surrounding area with a nuclear bomb in order to rest assure that no virus would spread?Romero's film seems to be an ugly commentary on the military and the government, how, in the attempt to create another dangerous weapon to destroy civilizations whose relations aren't in line with ours, backfires, and, as a result, we harm ourselves instead. Two of the heroes we follow were in Vietnam, seemingly scarred by the experience, and hold a very negative view of the military for which they served. I also felt Romero was commenting on the dangers of chemical warfare(Agent Orange?)and how we are always on the verge of causing societal collapse due to our own indulgences and mad science. I think the movie in groundbreaking in the disease of choice, we see mankind tearing apart it's self not as undead zombies cannibalizing the human race, but us destroying ourselves unwillingly due to an affliction which removes our humanity, leaving only a mania causing the compulsion to assault and kill in the worse ways possible. Following a select few, we see the virus slowly turn them into babbling, incoherent idiots, acting on strange impulses. Lynn Lowry is infected almost from the get-go, her father played by Richard Liberty(most know him as "Frankenstein" in Romero's "Day of the Dead")actually acting out towards her with incestuous embraces. Lane Carroll is Judy, a nurse, pregnant with volunteer firefighter David's(Will MacMillan)child. Harold Wayne Jones is David's old football buddy Clank. They join Liberty's Artie and Lowry's Kathy as the gang pursue freedom from quarantine. Sufficed to say, their chances are grim. Romero allows us to see government bureaucrats discussing what to do about the outbreak, contemplating using a "radiation scenario" as a lie to inform the public towards why they had to drop the bomb on a town in our own country. I think Romero does a great job of expressing the turmoil and madness through the virus as soldiers have a difficult time keeping order with the orderless. We see the patience of military leaders erode as conditions and matters worsen. We see the locals engaging with soldiers in gunfire, with casualties on both sides, as well as the suicidal harm inflicted on themselves(a priest setting himself on fire and a hanging just two such examples)and eventually the military begin to shoot people on sight. Romero's doomsday scenario certainly is a scary thought, a manufactured virus which turns people into crazed savages and absurd clowns unaware of their malady. This is really a violent movie with lots of people gunned down in cold blood. The tragedy which occurs after Watts has stumbled on a possible cure is gut-wrenching mainly because it goes to show you that in chaotic situations handled badly we in a sense lead to our own destruction. Another development, someone possibly immune to the virus, who isn't given a proper check-up due to incompetence is another such example of the inability to successfully handle an epidemic crisis when sprung on innocents. Romero's detractors I imagine will find his screenplay a bit ham-fisted and forced, but I think he touches on some interesting topics during a tumultuous time in our nation's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lets really break this film down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a big fan of horror movies and some of Romero's work, but the Crazies is a real low point in his career. The script, music, direction, lack of tension etc were such that it is barely justifiable to rate this tripe above 1/10. This film bares some comparison to Texas Chainsaw massacre that came out within a year or so, and also has some serious drawbacks in part also due to finances re the acting and directing etc but the sheer strength of the idea of a grotesque family of murderers deep in the woods even 30 or so years on still has power. The basic premise of the movie relates to a virus called 'trixie' that has infected a towns water supply. The virus is a military virus and designed to drive the enemy into a crazy/homicidal maniac. An interesting idea, that was annihilated in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a classic of the 70s exploitation/drive-in era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies may not be 'high-art, but it shows what George A. Romero could do on such low-budget terms in making it seem epic in scope and design. The budget, it seems, was that of almost a Roger Corman film, just enough for the film, some dingy sets, to get no-name actors with big personalities, and cheap effects. Never-the-less, classics have come out of low-budgets, and this (albeit with a couple of flaws) is one of them from the period. Another thing to note is that Romero is doing triple duty, as he did with many of his films up to Dawn of the Dead- he is also the editor, which is crucial for a film like this. A lot of times, there might be some continuity errors on the set, or there might be a shadow of a boom mike or other sort of goof. Luckily for the audience, Romero happens to be as superb an editor as he is at subversive, genre film-making, and many scenes come together- and become tenser- by his trademark style.Sometimes, to fit the quasi anti-war and notably science fiction elements of the story, Romero has to get creative. Take example for a scene where in the midst of rapid-fire arguments between government officials and officers and doctors, someone offers the suggestion of dropping a bomb or calling the higher-ups for results. There are a couple of split-second montages of pilots manning the planes, flying up, targeting, etc. This is highly effective visually for a film without much of a budget- it's almost reminiscent of what Stanley Kubrick did (though he did it in a slower, more deliberate-paced fashion) in Dr. Srangelove. In this whole sequence of officials bickering, half realism half satire, one gets the sense psychologically of what is to come.That's not to say The Crazies is all talk and no action, quite the opposite. In a sense this is almost like an un-official 'living-dead' picture, only this time Romero shows the whole thing from start to finish, how it starts, how it spreads, how the people start to change, and how a group of survivors try to stay on the run. Only this time, in a way, it's even more terrifying, as a 'Crazy' is more unpredictable than a crude, instinct-driven zombie. Take the opening as a prime example, where there is just a pure shock as kids watch their father going completely nuts, and seeing two more tragedies quickly unfold. It sets up the rapid-fire set-pieces, some of which fairly disturbing (if a little cheesy, one of the film's flaws). Another scene involving a priest is just as disturbing as the other, more of a sequence of images than a real 'action' scene. There's a sense of terror in seeing how real everything is (and it is, it's practically all location-shot), even as it does go a little, well, crazy after a while.There is also a dependable cast, as I mentioned, who are either very good or too over-the-top. Three actors in particular are very good among some so-so performances from the heroes: Lynn Lowry (who had a sort of minor cult-career in her day) is genuinely creepy, especially during her downfall; Richard Liberty, who hammed it up in Day of the Dead, fills in a good gap as a worried father; Richard France, who made a memorable appearance in 'Dawn', plays it all for show as a level-headed, frustrated doctor. Most of these are un-professionals, of course, so what you see is what you get- many of them work, some of them don't (the wife character, played by Lane Carroll, was mis-cast). But in the end, Romero puts together what he set out to do: it's another work of apocalyptic experimenting, where the bio-hazard suit-men are likely to be as, if not more, dangerous than the infected, and curiosity for the sci-fi driven subject matter goes along with the suspense and shock-value. It's certainly not for everyone, but for the drive-in fan in us all, it's bound to keep you in your seat- and it gets better on repeat viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero directs a wonderful low budget film about a virus that breaks out in a town after a military plane crashes in the mountains and the virus leaks down in through the water and which drives anyone it comes in contact with to complete madness or mindless drivel. The film really captures the essence of the Vietnam era fear as well as undercurrents of the communist threats where you don't know who might be "one of them." I saw nice nods to the original Invasion of the Body Snatchers in this. In the DVD commentary with Romero, he comments that this is the first time he's been able to step away from the camera and direct the scenes as a director, not as a director/cinematographer/camera operator. The results show a very cohesive story with great background action to compliment the foreground stuff. I picked up the DVD for about $10 at Deepdiscountdvd.com. Comes with commentary with George Romero, an interview with star Lynn Lowery, trailers and spots, posters and stills, and a biography of George Romero. If you're a fan of the 'Dead' series, you'll appreciate the style of film-making and story line from Romero.</fullReview>

I really like the people portraying the crazy people. The scene when at least a dozen maniacs rushing the military and in the carnage you see a women sweep the ground and you see bodies and she doesn't seem to notice.The violence is awesome.

		<shortDescription>Good Romero film but flawed by low budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George A. Romero's "The Crazies" starts in the small town of Evan City where we see a creepy scene in which a man goes insane and kills his entire family. We soon find out that something has contaminated the water supply of Evan City, causing people to die and/or go incurabley insane. The film follows a group of people who must evade the highly contagious virus and the even more dangerous US military, who are called in to quarentine the town. Romero has done a good job here, the style is good and the script is good but there are still a lot of problems. At first I didn't really mind the bad special effects and the little problems of "The Crazies" low budget, but the movie does start to look stupid after a while. It has the feeling of a traditional Romero film, the characters are good, it's shot in Pennsylvania, there's a little satire, but it isn't as shocking or cool as Romero's dead films for example. But the movie isn't all that bad, and since it's Romero I rate this a 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1973 a long time ago, the end of the Vietnam war, you know how chaotic that was, so in the same year when this movie was made, similar chaos is well on show here. These troops immediately sent into this small town with half baked orders not really knowing what they're supposed to be doing or why, armed and kited out in gas masks, white suits, a panic soon sets in within the locals and then the hell breaks loose . The locals both crazed and uncared start playing WWthree with the soldiers and things just start getting well out of hand. The subtle communication breakdowns and errors are very well delivered in this, these errors which seem to be going a long way in helping create this chaotic mess. David France plays an excellent role as the doctor searching for a cure, a real personality so overbearing. Of this kind of movie theme(VIRUS OUTBREAK) this one really has done it best.. Others like Outbreak and Quarantine etc. always have these predicable endings, Disney endings. There's always a cure, very convenient and then everything is wrapped up so tidily. None of that nonsense in The Crazies though. A cult movie this is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the other reviews have covered the relevant points, so I won't go over anything specific about the film. This film was always a great memory for me, for I first saw it in 1975. Seeing it again has brought back all those amazing feelings and emotions which fill a young teenage mind (back in the 70's) It's one of those films which just stick out above the rest simply because of the era in which I watched it. (See 'That 70's Show' to see what I mean) I think the film has shock value, not the least because of the unknown actors who give the whole movie a solid basis in realism. It could be any town, anywhere, right? It's great movie making, and thank God it lacks all the polish and sophistication of your average hollywood film these days. It reminds me, after seeing it again, of the British film "Threads" about a nuclear assault on the UK, which goes on to follow the survivors in a very bleak aftermath. Anyway, The Crazies gets ALL my votes and it always will. (Strange how past decades take on a rosy hue after a while...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Romero delivers again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always been a fan of George Romero since "Night of the Living Dead". I had heard about "The Crazies" in research books, mostly saying it was a commercial flop and did not equal Romero's earlier "NOTLD".I enjoyed "The Crazies", though. The unknown actors are very good and should have received other roles. Unfortunately, most of the cast didn't make any other movies (save perhaps Lynn Lowry, one of my favorites). Lane Carroll is very good as the pregnant woman on the run, Lynn Lowry is memorable as a blonde hippie stricken with disease, Harold Wayne Jones is a great hero turned villain, and Richard France is great as the harried scientist searching for an anectode to a virus set loose in a small town. Look for France as the TV scientist in "Dawn of the Dead"!While "The Crazies" does not deliver the jolts and shocks of "NOTLD", it is still a tense thriller, filled with chase scenes, battles between civilians and soldiers, heartbreaking scenarios of civilians going crazy, and chilling portrayals of parents killing their children, grandmothers stabbing people with knitting needles, and fathers attempting to rape their own daughters! Heavy stuff for an early 70s movie, but great entertainment! Romero's usual dreary, hopelessness appears up front and center from the beginning of the movie and lasts until the very end. Lots of surprises and twists, surprising gore effects, and a great soundtrack! Recommended for those wanting to see what Romero accomplished in-between "NOTLD" and "Dawn of the Dead" or any horror fan searching for a movie with an anti-military message!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Operation crazy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After churning out the very influential "Night of the Living Dead" a couple years earlier, Romero would return to the genre with this stark, compact and audacious little low-budget paranoia thriller. It doesn't waste much time as it grabs you, shakes you about and won't let you go. Straight away you're put into the same mind-set as the characters, because you're never quite sure what's happening until the pieces eventually come together. Still it leaves you hanging. It surprised me how much I liked it and how caught up I got. It was a failure when released, but has slowly picked up recognition and this could be the cause of the growing appeal of Romero's Dead legacy. Nothing hides how cheap it is, but Romero does an excellent job delivering a relentlessly taut cautionary tale that takes swipes on the close-minded military bigheads and politicians. The towns folk and soldiers are nothing more than expendable tools in something that's treated like a reckless war. We watch how the virus which has broken out eventually becomes a lesser threat as hysteria and panic takes over leaving really no one in control of the situation. They're facing something they just can't comprehend. This makes the thoughtful material highly unpredictable, downbeat and effective in detailing the confusion and carnage. The main group of characters we follow come across sympathetic and believable in their plight, because a good amount of time is spent on them. Everything is filmed in a semi-documentary style and storms up a delirious cloud with the gritty look enhancing the raw, sweeping intensity. Romero gets some passages which unsettle and teeter on anxious tension, and uses blunt force with well timed results. The engaging cast (Will MacMillan, Lane Carroll, Lloyd Hollar and Harold Wayne Jones) are mainly made up of no-names, but cult figures Lynn Lowry, Richard Liberty and the burly Richard France make prominent appearances.</fullReview>

It isn't as good as that...but how could it be? This is well-directed and has some nice bloody moments...but it doesn't work too well. The basic problem is some of the writing and acting. Some of the dramatic scenes are pretty poorly written and some of the actors are really really BAD! Some are just OK--Will MacMillan (as David) and Richard France (as Dr. Watts) come off best.

		<fullReview>I saw this movie again after maybe 15 years at a film festival last year. It's a very tense piece of film making despite the budget. The thing that really struck me was the parallel with the Katrina mess, which was only a few months old at the time. The themes of a government run amok, with people trying, but miserably failing to help, the gunfights between authorities and citizens, all reminded me of the recent news. Like most Romero films The Crazies makes a political statement, and one that has retained a lot of applicability.The alternation of tense action sequences with "behind-the-scenes" views of the command and and science team are very effective. No one's blameless, or in entirely in the wrong in this whole film, which really makes the point.A pretty intense film that hasn't dated too much, especially for a popular movie made in 1973.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been "Crazier"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A virus with the codename "Trixie" has been accidentally unleashed in Evans City, Pennsylvania. This virus either renders you totally and irreversibly insane or dead. The military have moved in and declared martial law on the citizens, without offering any explanation as to what is going on. The virus has already gotten to some of the citizens, and the military desperately tries to round up everyone to contain it's spread as much as possible, no matter what methods they have to use.A group of 5 townspeople manage to break free from the roundup and escape. They make their way to the edge of the army boundary only to find that slowly but surely all of them but one has contracted the virus. As the Army bring in a specialist to try and figure out how to stop the virus, the madness continues to spread. Eventually the last of the escapees is rounded up, and with no sure in sight, the head of the military operation is told to pull out and head to another possibly infected area.So goes the storyline to George A. Romero's 1973 film "The Crazies". This is only my 2nd Romero flick (the other being 1985's "Day of the Dead".) There are a few problems I had with "The Crazies".Firstly, I was, as it says in my heading, expecting a little more "craziness". While Romero did show the effects of the virus on some people, such as Judy, Clank and Kathy, I found the episodic shots of the rest of the townspeople not really representative of the seriousness of the situation. With martial law declared and the people not being informed of what was truly going on, I figured there would be more resistance and retaliation. For me, the few scenes shown of the rest of the townspeople were sadly lacking in helping the viewer appreciate the seriousness of the situation.Secondly, as far as I saw, there were but 2 people who were truly driven to madness by the virus. They would be the guy who set his house on fire at the beginning of the film, and Artie Bolman (Katie's dad) who raped his own daughter. Other than that I took the shooting and attacking of the military more as retaliation. Not any kind of madness. The bottom line here is that these ideas were just not fully followed-through with.Other than those 2 rather big problems, I found there was a general sense of panic from the main characters, especially from David. You sympathized more for he and Judy than the rest of the town.Overall, solid action, with a decent storyline (I would have loved to see the whole "madness" thing explored a little more) made for a pretty good 2nd Romero experience. I will be looking into seeing more of his work.Rating: 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crazies is George A Romero's finest film, and most under-rated. You as people if they ave seen it, they claim to never of heard of it. That's too bad. This film is simply amazing, beautifully filmed, scary story (Not make you jump scary, but the creepy -this could possibly happen one day- scary) and wonderful acting. For the first time out of any Romero film, I actually cared about these characters, which makes the movie more tragic when it comes to the ending. I won't say what, but I'll say this, this is the only film I have ever felt emotion towards another character, I felt their loss.I may be alone on this, but it's a much better film then Night of the Living Dead, which is another masterpiece from the same director. Romero has a brilliant mind and his social commentary with every film is astounding. great film. 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Where to start....? Judging from seeing this movie, I can only gather that it was made by George Romero's evil twin brother, who has since vanished or crawled back in between the walls of an abandoned apartment building. Not to make it sound more terrible than it is...... is impossible. Its terrible. Never has there been, in the history of movies, a motion picture with the lamest dialogue, dialogue delivery, and crappy ending. The acting coach must have been William Shatner, because no-one else could provide such "vivid" insight into these performances. There are innumerable scenes where the camera pans between people having conversations with other people, and other people watching these people have the conversations. There are scenes where conversations are being held ... even though only 1 person is talking. These conversations include answers being given to questions not asked, BECAUSE .. no-one else is talking. Also, conversation is too strong a word for what they are doing. I would describe it more as masculine menopause at very high decibels. Also .. the pointless numbers of hazard suit wearing army extras is comical rather than the intended threatening menace. As an added touch, these white clad (potential KKK reference) extras mumble all their lines. Its as if Charlie Brown's teacher did all the voice work for them. The only redeemable qualities of this movie is the idea of the movie, the very very few action sequences throughout the movie (only about 15 min worth), and the death of many of the main characters. I figured that I had sold my soul to Satan when I watched Ernest Borgnine in Devil's Rain, but I was wrong. George Romero has my soul in a glass jar in his basement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Evans City, PA is a city with a population of 3614. Its' a sleepy little town. But this little town will wake up in the middle of a hellish nightmare. Marshall Law is instated by the military as they button up the town. Unfortunately this town is infected with Trixie, a bioengineered virus that drives people mad. This low budget ($270,000) film is quite grand for what little budget they had to work with. The mockumentary style lends a tension to it. Yje camerawork has energy and the acting for the most part is very good. The editing is good with a steady and at times frantic. For a movie that is over 30 years old it holds up well. Look closely and you'll see many odes to Night of the Living Dead and the overall look and feel of The Crazies is very much what you'll see in his best film Dawn of the Dead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had rented this movie because it reminds me of whats going on today in America with all this biological/chemical warfare going on. This movie starts out about a family man that kills his wife and goes for the kids just before the house burns and the kids are taken out and sent to a laboritory. They soon figure out that there is a scare of biological warfare going out and that the water is tainted and the chemicals in the water is causing people to go crazy and kill. Laboritory researchers try and figure out where it came from and if there is a cure. meanwhile people are taken into a shelter where they are isolated and not allowed to go outside. Anyone who goes outside is shot by Army troopers dressed in lab outfits that go out shooting people. this movie looks very real and I liked the acting. I just hope that it remains a movie and not reality.</fullReview>

Only this time, instead of zombies on the rampage, it's normal folks driven crazy by nerve gas.It's well paced and exciting, and the action scenes are well handled. And any movie with Lynn Lowry can't be all bad. Romero's subsequent movies failed to recapture the immediacy that made Night of the Living Dead so effective, and he didn't really come into his own as a director until Martin. But still, the movies he made in this pre-Martin phase are definitely interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but still exciting paranoia thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crazies" is one of Romero's non-Zombie pictures. As much as I love his "Dead" trilogy (I'll admit they're the finest things the man has done), some people are so quick to praise them they tend to overlook the other things the man has made. Romero has fashioned some very good films that don't involve reanimated corpses. Both this and "Martin" are probably his finest from this category. "The Crazies" isn't without flaws, mind you, and isn't in the same league as "Dawn of the Dead" (a film it resembles in someways), but its an exciting paranoia thriller that has some intelligent social commentary.The direction by Romero ranks among his finest. Hes a great editor as well, and uses quick cuts to build a constant tension (there's few shots in this film that last more than several seconds). The film is a study of mass paranoia, where the major enemy can sometimes come from within. The film touches upon many of the themes that "Dawn of the Dead" later did, and while they aren't as seamless as they were in that film, they are more subtly treated. Romero crafts exploitation films for the thinking man."The Crazies" isn't completely without flaws. A lot of the acting ranges from decent (Will MacMillan in particular) to pretty lousy and quite awkward. Its a bit of a distraction in moments, but it doesn't really matter in others. Also, there's little build up, as the story kind of seems to jump right in immediately and a few things are never really properly explained. Still, its a very good piece of low-budget film-making thats recommended to anyone who loved the "Dead" trilogy. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE CRAZIES plays like a low budget ANDROMEDA STRAIN, but without the competent government response. CRAZIES is replete with official ineptitude and bureaucratic bungling ala today's Dubya administration and FEMA. Common sense takes a back seat to autocratic protocols as townspeople assault soldiers and helicopters get shot at-oh yeah, very Katrina-esquire. This movie also takes a jaundiced eye towards the military. Post-Vietnam sentiments like, "You trust the army?" and "The army ain't nobody's friend" abound throughout the film. Although, where the priest torches himself out of protest like the infamous Buddhist monk is a little heavy-handed. 70s buffs will also be interested in the song "God Help Us" at the end. It was written by Carol Bayer Sager and Melissa Manchester and sung by someone that sounds very much like Karen Carpenter. I liked the performance of the actor who played the Colonel and thanks to another reviewer, I figured out who the daughter was. She's been in some other 'B' horrorfests as well. I wish I was a screenwriter because with an updated treatment, this script would be gold in today's 9/11 world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's trouble and mayhem in store for the lucky folk of Evan's City...when a dodgy virus called Trixie finds its way there via crashed plane. I have to say that I've only viewed this movie once and, though seen quite recently, have managed to (unfortunately) discard most of its content from my memory. Clearly not the sign of an exceptional film...but a pretty good one nevertheless, and grimly entertainingly for the most part with some memorable scenes: the opening with the children, a suspect old dame, a fiery priest, and generally mad behaviour from the townspeople etc. It's low budget but to be honest who cares; Romero makes good use of what he has. The acting isn't worth mentioning, but the characters work just fine in their situations. The focus is mostly on local residents David, Judy and Clank, and their tag-a-longs, as they attempt to escape while avoiding strangely clad military men assigned to controlling the area. Oh, and there's a concerned doctor involved too. Anyhow, viewed at least once, this flick is interesting and accessible, and despite a somewhat weak end manages to trundle along fairly ably with the viewer in tow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem I have with Romero is that he never lives up to viewer's expectations. He has good ideas both in terms of story and in terms of film making but he never really delivers. I don't think it has to do with the budget but rather with a lack of focus. I found that specifically in Dawn of the Dead. Crazies is much better and also shorter. What I really like about the film is that it is actually a scathing satire about politicians and the assumed infallibility of the bureaucratic apparatus. The military machinery fails to contain the virus and even fails to be anywhere in time or even have the right equipment. It is amazing as to what extent Romero was actually right about this- as recent events have proved. Crazies is also reasonably good as an action film. A lot of reviews remark on the allegedly poor acting. This is something I cannot really confirm. From my point of view all in all the film is a competent job particularly given the budgetary restraints. But as in Dawan of the Dead the screenplay clearly lacks focus and towards the end the film gets confused and boring. But all in all it's a film worth viewing.</fullReview>

And a brief scene in the middle when the soldiers killed a farmer and his wife right in front of their young son nearly made me plotz. (Look it up.) Paranoia combined with bureaucratic idiocy isn't original. But ol' George did it perfectly.Lynn Lowry did an excellent job in her role as the spaced out teen.

If the dead somehow became reanimated, wouldn't the resulting mayhem be "Dawn of the Dead"?

		<fullReview>I remember finding The Crazies a bit cheap and irritating. The acting was really poor quality and the sound was fuzzy and crackly. I also remember being very disturbed by it, which is a good thing in my opinion, as any good horror film should push you out of your "confort" zone. Therefore, there are things about The Crazies that I don't like and things about it which I like a lot.It's a very influential film. In fact, it surely provided the inspiration for the film Outbreak, as well as the Richard Laymon bestseller One Rainy Night. It tells of a plane crash and the subsequent poisoning of an area of the US (the plane was carrying chemicals). The people go a lot loopy and sometimes turn psychotic if they are exposed to the poison. Before long, the army is in town exterminating the infected and trying to stop those with the disease from breaking out of the borders to spread it elsewhere. The film follows three separate characters - one is the main army officer in charge of the operation, one is a doctor seeking an antidote, and one is an ex-vietnam vet who tries to bust out of town, not realising that he has a natural immunity to the illness and is the only person who could actually save everybody.The ending of the film is bleak. It's hard to enjoy it as entertainment, especially since mankind seems doomed from the evidence on show here. Nevertheless, it makes you think about the state of the world, and also comments on the invasion of privacy that ensues if the military start flexing their might in crisis situatiuons. The film has a cult following, and I think that its reputation will grow and grow the more widely it is screened.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As unsettling in its own right as NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, THE CRAZIES gets off to a disturbing start and seldom lets up. Romero breaks ground yet again by holding up to the light our deepest, darkest fears (some of which have absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with the virus spreading throughout the land). All bases (even our basest desires) are covered. While it's been suggested that THE CRAZIES was a dress-rehearsal for DAWN OF THE DEAD (and it may well have been), it's also much, much more than that. THE CRAZIES is, in many respects (some of which I've cited), even scarier than DAWN OF THE DEAD. If there's one Romero film that begs redress, it's this one. (See it and imagine what Romero could do with a bigger budget and tighter direction. Use DAY OF THE DEAD and THE DARK HALF as a yardstick.) Romero is always interesting, and THE CRAZIES rates a look.</fullReview>

Take a military plane that crashes into the hills of Pennsylvania. A biological experiment from that plane leaks into the water supply of the nearby town, and people start acting insane and start to riot.The military comes in to asess the damage, and they 'quaritine' the town. Then you begin to wonder who is the crazier of the two groups. The military or the Army?The interesting plot could be, what is the next step in the biological breakdown of a human after the insaneness? Could death, and the reanimation be next? The 'Crazies' act like the zombies in other Romero films. This film's plot is more feasible than the 'Space Radition' premise in the original 'Night of The Living Dead'. This film is worth seeing!

I think this could have been made better. I have seen it a few more times since, though, and it is growing on me.It's typical 70's Romero - low-budget, helicopters, widespread panic/hysteria etc, etc.Obviously an anti Military movie, but I don't think Romero shows/develops this well enough, as it appears to me that the townspeople just start shooting/killing the soldiers for no reason -I know that there's supposed to be this disease spreading through the area but Romero, fails to show the symptoms developing, well enough, in the townsfolk- and I end up feeling more sorry for the poor soldiers who have, suddenly, been ordered into the middle of this madness. I actually find myself wanting the soldiers to blow the s*** out of, the majority, of the inbred redknecks that inhabit the town.The main characters are all of a reasonable-to-good standard, with Clank's gradual disintegration and the final scenes between Judy and David, which I found really touching, being high points. ... and all this, with the threat of a Nuclear bomb being dropped on the place, hanging over the whole film - maybe that's what should have happened- It would be interesting to see the film with that ending.I think this film would probably be better if Romero had, had a bigger budget to work with, Overall fair 6.5/10... ...meanwhile... back at the Zeebra club...</fullReview>

Neither side is portrayed as the bad guy, although characters on each side exhibit negative qualities. My only complaint is that there isn't any depth to any of the characters, but the movie still works even without this element. Definitely not the best Romero film, but solid nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many of George Romero's films the blueprint of the plot is the world vs. disease. Add to that scenario confusion, paranoia, and claustrophobia, and you have great drama and a wonderful sci-fi horror movie. While not as gory and emotional as DAY OF THE DEAD or as delicious as DAWN OF THE DEAD, THE CRAZIES tells a similar tale of a small town besieged by a man-made threat that destroys sanity and reason. The military presence does not help the situation. It is worsened, actually. Yet all the characters are comfortable to be around and identify with. Romero's films all have such natural dialogue, this picture no exception. Although a bit bleak and depressing (charmingly sick use of the BATTLE HYMN OF THE REPUBLIC), this is an excellent Saturday afternoon watch nonetheless. Then at night watch NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and DAY OF THE DEAD with no lights on and I guarantee you'll have plenty of stuff to think about for a few days. That's one thing I love about Romero's films: they're incredibly deep, though not at the cost of keeping the movies exciting. Visit THE CRAZIES and see what a horror movie could ascend to.</fullReview>

A virus causes people in a small town to act in violent and disturbed ways. The town is quarantined and martial law is declared, which only makes matters worse. Scientists struggle to figure out what's causing this and to find a cure. Meanwhile, the citizens are rebelling against the military and things in general just get way out of hand.This is a very dark and disturbing film.

		<fullReview>The allusions to Vietnam come fast and heavy in The Crazies, Romero's mordantly funny take on the chaos that ensues when a madness-inducing biochemical spills into a small Pennsylvania town's water supply. When the military is called in to quarantine and round up the infected, hordes of trigger-happy, biohazard-suit-wearing soldiers descend upon the bucolic countryside, but the true source of horror comes in the form of a quartet of Washington bureaucrats more interested in concocting an official truth to cover up their blunder than accounting for the accumulation of corpses. As in Dawn of the Dead, the victims' mutations don't preclude their subservience to routine, so a housewife's irrationality takes the form of vigorously sweeping a field and a kindly grandmother pauses long enough from knitting a quilt to brandish her needles as lethal weapons.Romero, who also edited, juxtaposes these moments of absurdity with sudden inserts of graphic brutality?Dawn's iconic exploding head finds its throat-grabbing precedent in a gas mask that forcibly vanishes from its owner's neck?that suffuse each frame in an equivocal sense of dread, unbalancing even the most banal bits of exposition. This queasy cutting is a kind of visual equivalent to, and consequence of, the misinformation that courses through the military chain of command: just as the ground general isn't initially told that the offending chemical is a bio weapon without a cure, the troops are delivered into combat without the faintest idea of the contagion's symptoms; and since the white-suited men are unable to adequately explain their presence, the rage-crazed citizens uphold their arm-bearing rights against what appears to be an invasion.It's a movie that's about hysteria and equally hysterical in tone, skillfully tone-shifting between wry guffaws?the bad acting, the scientist's exasperated line readings?and stomach-turning gruesomeness?I'll never forget the father and daughter, one of the most repulsive things fathomable. Once you've seen Romero's version of man's inhumanity to man, it's impossible to carelessly laugh at his violence-inflected comedy without considering its moral repercussions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is immediately apparent that the Crazies was filmed on a paltry budget by an up-and-coming (at the time) director, but don't let that detract from what is actually a pretty good film. A deadly virus erupts in a small town in America and before anyone can think, the military arrive to try and prevent it spreading across the country. What I loved about this picture was the unsentimentality of the characters. Life and death decisions are taken at breakneck speed and with the minimum of fuss. The film runs along at a very fast pace, with the action starting more or less right away and not really relenting till the suitably bleak ending. There are some familiar themes explored: the role of the military in a crisis situation, how people react to events out of their control etc etc. It is up to the viewer to decide how well these issues are tackled. Or better still, just enjoy what is a decent and well scripted (if cheaply made) production. One aspect I did find incredulous plot-wise was the possibility that the virus-infested town may be nuked! That seemed incredibly far-fetched to me.</fullReview>

Romero experiments with the epicness of Dawn of the Dead in this movie but does not quite make it. This movie with the heart of Martin combined make what would later become Dawn though. Romero learned from these early films and put that knowledge to good use on the further Dead movies.

If the "crazies" in this film ate flesh you could very easily call this a sequel/remake of Night of the Living Dead. Romero does a good job considering the very small budget but there are a few problems in the screenplay. The biggest problem is the political "messages", which are in every Romero flick but the message here gets very annoying because the director keeps beating the viewer over the head with it. I understand Romero has a thing for the government but the way they're portrayed here seems more comical than anything else. The majority of the performances are annoying as well but somehow the film remains entertaining. Later remade as 28 Days Later.</fullReview>

MacMillan as David, Harold Wayne Jones as Clank, Lloyd Hollar as Col. Peckem, Richard Liberty as Artie, Lynn Lowry as Kathy, Richard France as Dr. Watts and Harry Spillman as Maj. Ryder. While there are some very tiny moments of goriness, suspense and the feeling of uncomfortableness, this just doesn't have the same kick Romero's zombie work, in fact, I found it rather boring and disappointing most of the way. Adequate, in my opinion!</fullReview>
