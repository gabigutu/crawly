		<shortDescription>Nothing new here, but so good that it mostly makes up for that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the last several years we've seen more than a dozen movies about people becoming infected by a virus who then turn on and kill those around them. '28 Days Later' is one of the most popular and also one of the best. Sure the concept was nothing new, but the film was made with enough style and had such strong talent involved that it ended better than just another by-the-numbers outbreak movie. It was a hit and unsurprisingly was followed by a slew of clones, many of which are not really worth your time. One of the earliest examples of this is the 1973 film 'The Crazies' by George Romero, which too spawned a few imitations. Well now with all these popular titles getting remade someone decided this film too was ready for the redux treatment, and though it features little to nothing audiences haven't already seen, it, like '28 Days Later,' is a film made with care and the result is a great time at the movies.Pros: Though the characters are pretty thin, the actors give strong performances and add some depth to their roles. A pretty good score that keeps one on edge. Perfectly paced, starting slow and then letting loose the rest of the time. Gorgeous photography and country scenery. Some good scary moments. Also some pretty suspenseful sequences. Faithful enough to the original to please fans, while standing on it's own enough that it's not a simple rehash. Some humor here and there to keep things from getting deadly serious.Cons: If you've seen one virus outbreak movie you've seen them all. Pretty predictable. Doesn't really give us a chance to breath once the pace picks up. Plot wears thin after the characters and premise are established.Final thoughts: Movie buffs complain that there aren't enough original movies being made in Hollywood, and they're right. And I'm not saying that we shouldn't keep pushing for that, but I don't think we should dismiss every film simply because of it's lack of originality. If it's made by people with a lot of talent who always work hard to try and make a good film then it could be worth seeing. This one here is one heck of a good time at the movies, better than most remakes really. Give it a whirl.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely killer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is clear that the current cycle of horror remakes is far from over and the results so far have for the most part been surprisingly good. This trend continues with 'The Crazies'- a reinvention of George Romero's little-seen 1973 original. The plot is beyond simple: a biological agent gets into the water supply of a small town in Iowa called Ogden Marsh and turns the inhabitants into homicidal maniacs. Things get even worse when a US Army unit initiates a brutal containment operation where shooting first and not bothering to ask questions is the order of the day.The film wastes little time building up to the first outbreak of insanity and then chillingly portrays how the town's social fabric is obliterated at break-neck speed. There is an abundance of scary moments, inventive gore, and even some very black humor. Some moments are so intensely suspenseful that time seems to practically stand still. All the cast play their parts well; including Timothy Olyphant as the town sheriff, Joe Anderson as his deputy, and Radha Mitchell as the town doctor. The minimalist soundtrack is also strikingly effective. All in all, this film is a treat for horror fans and for anyone looking for an intense night out at the movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating and terrifying</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies, a remake of a seldom-seen 1972 George Romeo film, is about a small town whose inhabitants drink tainted water and become deranged. The movie is slick but still terrifying, relying not only on wacked-out effects but also on unadulterated suspense to really rattle your nerves. At a Little League game in Ogden Marsh, Iowa, a man wanders into the outfield carrying a shotgun. When the man raises the weapon, Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) shoots him dead. But the man wasn't drunk, he'd just gone crazy. Dutton investigates further, with the help of his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson), and discovers that a plane carrying a deadly cargo has crashed into a nearby creek, thus poisoning the town's drinking water.From there, events quickly get out of hand, as anyone who'd drunk water from their taps becomes first listless and unresponsive, then mumbly, then completely unhinged. But that's only the beginning of the nightmare for the town, which is then surrounded by a military force bent on containing the virus by any means necessary.This is only kind of a zombie film. I mean, no one's dining on the flesh of their living compatriots, there's no shambling, and mindless killing. (There's plenty of killing, but the afflicted people still have the capacity for reason.) One thing I liked about this was that precious time isn't spend trying to discover the reason for everyone's behavior; attention is focused on the survivors and how they react to what's going on. I also appreciated that at no time does anyone, even the sheriff, have this superhuman ability to know what must be done and how to do it. Dutton isn't a superhero, he's a sheriff.Another thing that helps a lot is the pacing. Too often, things either move so quickly that you can't figure out what's being done to whom or too slowly so that the suspense angle becomes the boredom angle. This is crucial for a horror film, which basically trafficks in suspense. Director Breck Eisner keeps the action coming without holding up the story (e.g., no drawn-out standoffs when it would look implausible), and there are plenty of creeping-up-on-you moments to choke twelve cows. Olyphant looks a lot like a younger Bill Paxton here, and he's a good fit - Sheriff Dutton is a solid leader, but he's not an improbable one. He's the kind of guy who rises to the occasion, not surpasses it completely. If you're looking for a movie where the hero is always armed to the teeth and subsequently never gets much more than a scratch on him, this isn't for you. Dutton has to constantly fight with his own instincts and change his attitude during the course of the movie (save everyone, save his wife, save a few people, save himself). People who make horror movies know they're making them for a pretty select audience. Lots of people don't like horror movies at all, and those who do are somewhat picky about them (particularly with so many big-budget ones from which to choose), so standards are high. It's important to grab that core audience, show them something they haven't seen or haven't seen done particularly well, then smack them upside the head. Classic horror films used the horror of the unseen to great effect, and more-recent genre films try the same thing. (One reason for this is that we've become inured to in-your-face slasher films, because the anticipation of the slasher doing his slashing has largely been eroded. But that's a digression right there.Basically, if zombie movies in general are your bag, you should love The Crazies. (If you don't like any horror films regardless, there's no way you should see this.) The Crazies is effectively scary, mixing human emotions with raw blood and gore and endless edge-of-your seat thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better remakes!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Romero's 1973 cult classic was a fun film. It focused a lot on the government and the scientists trying to figure out the cure. It also had some solid chaos in it. It was a very memorable low-budget film and when a remake was announced, I was not pleased.Boy do I love it when I am wrong sometimes! The Crazies remake was a fun film. It had the tension, the violence, subtle social commentary regarding how the politics in America work, and it was a fun thrill ride. What I loved most was the violence. The story was pretty faithful to the original and all it needed to do was up the violence. Great fun and it kept you guessing when things were going to turn bad. The tension was perfect. Easily one of the better horror remakes I have seen in the last few years. My only minor gripe with this film was the ending. I won't spoil it, but it felt a little lame to me. However, I liked the movie so much, I want a sequel! How crazy is that?!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies neither drives audiences ballistic nor restores their sanity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even outside the fact that The Crazies is actually a remake of a 1973 George A. Romero film, I have a feeling most audiences still have the "infection" flicks of the past decade still fresh on their minds. Over the past ten years, we've endured quite a few and several have even packed quite a bit of wallop (28 Days Later, Planet Terror, etc.). While I feel Breck Eisner's 2010 redux of The Crazies isn't anything new in this regard, I still found myself entertained over the course of the 100 minute runtime.This may have something to do with the fact that I grew up in a small town in southern America not too unlike the isolated Iowa setting of the film and I can recognize the small town obsession and paranoia of larger political/governmental interests heaving themselves on the livelihood of small town folk and invading their way of living. That idea has been exaggerated in a worst-possible-scenario with The Crazies. The remoteness of the society works to the advantage of the film quite well. Perhaps even too well as some audience members may wonder where the rest of the world is when all of this is happening. The American media of all shapes and forms would have had a field day reporting over anything vaguely resembling this mess.The direction is impressive with much attention to detail taken from behind the camera. It's especially comforting that the director didn't depend solely on violence. Eisner even cuts away from some of the more graphic "impact" moments, coincidentally making more of a psychological impact on the audience.The film moves with brisk pace as our heroes struggle to survive the unthinkable. Eisner, like Romero, is astute at making Hazmat suits and the traditional gas mask into terrifying images. The very presence of such an image confronting you effectively sends a feeling of utter helplessness into the audience?as if you are caught in the middle of something far beyond your control. Our central characters seem vulnerable and "exposed" at every turn as a result while scary military men in full bio-garb follow close at their heels.There are some issues that prevented me from loving the film, though. The script could have used a little work as plot holes were easily noticeable and characters were either very thinly developed or, at times, made ridiculous decisions. Like another recent "zombie" film, Zombieland, occasional over-the-top actions of some of the characters seemed out of place. There is very little, to no, character development in the film and most of the roles are simply caricatures we've seen in countless other movies. Thankfully Timothy Olyphant (whom has been on my radar since Deadwood), Radha Mitchell (who's becoming somewhat of a scream queen, isn't she?), and a surprising performance from Joe Anderson add credibility to such events.Many twists and turns the film takes aren't very surprising, but The Crazies manages to keeps atmosphere flowing throughout most of the films scenes. While protagonists investigating barns and being captured by increasingly menacing foes becomes rather monotonous towards the films conclusion, the film just manages to get away while not overstaying it's welcome.Eisner is apparently in the mood for more of this horror remake mayhem since he's already in discussions to potentially direct remakes of The Brood and Creature from the Black Lagoon. As for The Crazies, this venture does its original quite a bit more justice than many of the others we've received as of late. For a visually pleasing and entertaining horror movie, The Crazies neither drives audiences ballistic nor restores their sanity.Related Recommendations: 28 Days/Weeks Later, Children of the Corn, rec, Quarantine, Planet Terror, Dawn of the Dead, Carriers, The Stand, The Crazies (1973)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'll be crazy about 'The Crazies'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of the original movie made by George Romero in the 1970s, The Crazies tells the story of what happens after a highly infectious contagion finds its way into a rural water supply after a classified plane crashes and turns the previously down to earth townsfolk into violent rampaging killers ? the 'Crazies' of the title. First off it's fair to say that the new version of The Crazies is a vastly superior film to the original. The story is very well set up and generally builds momentum at a nice pace. You don't feel like you're being plunged blindly into the action. Of course the story isn't exactly new. While it still remains a brilliant premise and was no doubt unique in the 70s when the original was made, nowadays we've seen this type of thing many times before. Movies such as Rec, its remake Quarantine, 28 Days Later, its sequel 28 Weeks Later and the Dawn of the Dead remake have saturated an already overcrowded market - with probably yet more to come. But while it's easy to say that the remake is just another in the aforementioned cycle of movies, it must also be pointed that when Romero did the original, he arguably invented a new genre just like he did when he made Night of the Living Dead: as well as 'the dead coming back to life' genre, Romero gave us 'the killer virus that turns normal people into insane killers' genre. The reality of the matter is by making those movies all those years ago, he was virtually inventing two types of story that would be mined again and again in later decades in everything from films and books to video games. If the aforementioned 28 Days Later is credited with the resurgence of the zombie flick, then it must also be acknowledged the debit it too owes Romero's original 'Crazies' film: this is no zombie flick. In both movies the victims are not the walking dead, but alive and kicking, albeit completely insane.While the production value is much bigger than the 70s release, the acting in the remake beats the original hands down. This is a movie with something for everyone: for the gals, there's Timothy Olyphant while Radha Mitchell supplies the goods for the guys. Playing the town Sheriff, Olyphant makes for a solid, likable and charismatic lead. Based on what he does here, surely A-list status and multi million dollar action roles are within his grasp. Similarly, playing his wife, Radha Mitchell brings a lot of gravitas and humility to her role and creates a very likable character. It's one of those rare moments of credibility ? and good casting - where the chemistry between two principals is so strong, you actually believe they could be married in real life and because of this, you're rooting for them every step of the way while everything around them is going to hell.There are two definite stand-out scenes in the movie: one set in a quarantine area with a group of people strapped to gurneys while a previously carefree towns person lumbers around wielding a pitch fork is chilling, while another, set in a car wash where every slap on the windscreen is to be feared, is relentlessly claustrophobic. These aren't just great scenes, its great film-making. The Crazies is a very well made film. Even the age-old and rather hackneyed 'no signal for the cell phone' problem, typical in movies such as this, is solved very neatly here. Rather than having it as a throwaway line of dialog, it's worked effectively into the plot. Plus in another key moment that can only be described as jaw dropping, we get an overhead shot of a crashed aircraft in a deep swamp. For a remake, it's fair to say this movie has its share of surprises.Another major plus is rather than telling the story from the usual teen perspective, the movie defies protocol and focuses on the adults. A refreshing change from the usual teen canon fodder, this is a smart move and makes it more than just another 'teens on the run' flick. Also while we know the U.S. government is responsible for the crash and the subsequent outbreak, motives are still kept effectively obscure. No explanation is ever offered and the film is all the better for it. By keeping everything so murky adds an air of mystery and menace to the proceedings. One small criticism, though: the film opens with an unnecessary 'flash forward' to a blazing inferno of a town where we see flaming cars. Clearly this is the aftermath of whatever disaster is about to take place because then we see a 'Two Days Earlier' caption and the movie begins. This opening ? brief as it is - does absolutely nothing to help the film. If anything it slightly lessens away the impact of what happens later because we've already had that small foretaste. However that's just a small complaint. Overall The Crazies is a well acted, entertaining and thrilling roller coaster ride of a movie. Everything moves along at a nice speed and the running time is not so long as to outstay its welcome. It delivers a good deal of jumps and scares, and is entertaining from start to the finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unapologetically relentless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having a horror film succeed on nearly every level is a rare manifestation these days; The Crazies is beyond slick, excellently acted, tense, is a remake that doesn't suck for once, and the to top it all? This re-imagining joins the exclusive club of a remake that trumps the original. (And thoroughly at that) No offence to the great George A. Romero who created the minor 'classic' back in 1973, but that movie was a poor effort in almost every capacity.Director Breck Eisner's Crazies is moody and smart with a great sense of humour about it. It never delves into self-seriousness, not tries to be overtly political. It evokes a sort of mash-up of Dawn of the Dead and Outbreak. There are some unapologetically relentless sequences propped by unbearable tension and horror and others of pure adrenaline fuelled mayhem and action. The marriage of horror and action that worked so well in films like 28 Days/Weeks Later succeeds here as well and has enough of a personal moral stance to not seem like a cookie-cutter studio product.In the quintessential hick town of Ogden Marsh, the small populous go about their normal hick activities; prepare for the spring plant, attend the popular town baseball games and for one young couple, prepare for the birth of their first child. David and Judy Dutton (played superbly by Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell) are the town sheriff and doctor respectively both of whom are well liked in the close-knit township. Suddenly, strange things begin to happen. Townsfolk begin acting odd, prone to violence and murder and bodies begin to pile up. Soon, the town is in disarray and thing go from bad to worse fast with the arrival of government forces who quickly cordon off the town and become more terrifying then the crazies themselves. With his deputy, the sheriff does everything in his power to get his budding family out of hell in time.One of many things I admire about The Crazies is it doesn't pussyfoot around. There is no dull build-up in which all key characters are given an introduction. We are thrust into the action right off the start and get to know the characters as the panic ensues. Joe Anderson as the deputy gets the most interesting character arc; again I will make a comparison to 2004's Dawn of the Dead this time regarding the character of CJ which one could attribute a number of similarities, including a killer moustache. Radha Mitchell who is no stranger to horror films having starred in flicks such as Rogue, Silent Hill and Pitch Black among others is perfectly suited for the role of strong female protagonist. Olyphant who has ample charisma is also pitch perfect as the compassionate but driven Sheriff and I hope roles like this will get him the leading jobs he deserves.The Crazies also benefits from having to real villain; it is more a movie of circumstances than black and white, good vs. evil. The shortcomings of this film are those found in many horror movies. We get jolts of sound that accompany boo! moments, but thankfully this is secondary to the impending sense of dread that makes up the movies core. The very final scene is one we have witnessed so many times before and the only thing that's comes to mind as I continue to see it is that the director does not have enough confidence in the films effectiveness. Small quibbles aside this is one of the best horror films of the last ten years and stands as proof that if care is taken all horror remakes don't have to make us crazy.Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Clever Horror Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although recently I have seen quite a few horror films, I am not very familiar with the original horror classics made by George Romero. Most of them are supposed to be thrilling and much better than the modern day remakes, yet I did enjoy Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead (2004). Originality is hard to develop in horror films because most audiences have seen everything before in previous motion pictures. You can make a blood-splattering zombie, vampire, or serial killer movie but chances are another filmmaker has already created a film with a similar story, bigger stars, and more gore. Yet every once in a while a director will come up with a clever story in order to make up for the lack of innovation in modern horror films. Last year's Paranormal Activity (2009) is one of those exceptions and so is Breck Eisner's The Crazies (2010).If our own government accidentally dropped a biological weapon on a small country town, would it take precautions to cover it up or would it admit the mistake and take necessary measures to help those infected? This is the situation in The Crazies, in which each family of a small town in Iowa begin developing violent symptoms and start losing their minds. One day at a high school baseball game a local farmer comes onto a baseball field with a double barrel shotgun. After failing to talk the crazed man out of dropping the gun, the local sheriff named David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is forced to shoot him. At first it is believed that the incident was a consequence of the farmer drinking too much but soon other citizens of the town begins acting in a familiar way. One man burns his house down while his wife and child are locked within. Another man appears to have lost the ability to speak. Confused about what is happening, David and his deputy go searching for possible leads to what could be causing the disturbing behavior of the locals. In their search they discover a crashed plane underneath the town's river and they soon see that it is no coincidence that those who live closest to the water supply are slowly developing symptoms of the strange disease. A few days after the first signs of the virus, military personnel suddenly appear and take everyone in town into custody. At the military base, David and his wife are separated because it is believed that she has been infected. The rest of the film follows David's journey to try and save his wife. Can he trust the government to do the right thing and take care of his wife or is he the only one who can save her? Although the Crazies themselves are entertaining, it is nothing viewers probably haven't seen before. They basically act exactly like zombies minus the biting. What separates this film from other horror films are the emotions shared by the main characters and the political questions brought up about how our government might handle the accidental insurgence of biological weapons on U.S. soil. Naturally every character begins to become paranoid over the fact that his or her friends and family may have become infected, yet how to you deal with knowing that your loved ones will soon become uncontrollably disturbed and may try to kill you. It is amazing, yet understandable how people's personalities can suddenly change at the first sign of any danger.Overall, The Crazies has enough action and gore to satisfy horror movie fans, but is also clever enough to separate it from most other modern horror remakes. So far this has been the biggest surprise for me in 2010.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The right kind of remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the 1973 George Romero film sees the rural Iowa town of Ogden Marsh become unhinged when it's residents begin exhibiting odd behavior, usually culminating in acts of violence. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is at a loss to explain what's happening to the people he's known all his life, but the discovery of a dead pilot in a marsh leads him to the answer, a downed plane infecting the town's water supply. It isn't long before the military has blocked all methods of communication and descended upon the town. Determined to render a final solution, they don't intend to let anyone out alive.Following the basic setup of the original, this update expands upon the story and throws in a few new directions and surprises. If you ask me, there was plenty of room for improvement. Romero's film is decent, but highly flawed. You could blame the budget, but Romero's done some fantastic work with low budgets. It definitely had bigger problems than that. This is the type of remake I wish there were more of, the type that can improve on a weak original. We spend the majority of the film with the four main characters as they attempt to escape the madness; David, his wife (Radha Mitchell), his deputy (Joe Anderson) and his wife's secretary (Danielle Pannabaker). I was already a fan of both Olyphant and the lovely Mitchell before viewing this, and they're once again in solid form here. This is basically Olyphant's show, and he owns the screen when he's on. I'd love to see him get more leading roles after this. Anderson and Pannabaker are also impressive, getting me to care about the fates of their characters, something that many horror films have a hard time doing. One of the major differences between this and the Romero original is the lack of focus on the military's point of view this time around. We spend the duration seeing the events from the perspective of the leads and various other townsfolk. While the POV shown in the '73 film did offer some levels of interest, I think it works better as far as menace goes to not do that here.The crazies themselves are well rendered, each person reacting differently to the virus. Some are completely gone while others still retain some semblance of a thought process, the hunters for instance. After seeing the trailer, I was worried that they'd turn this into another zombie movie, but I was happy to see that wasn't the case. Speaking of the crazies, Lynn Lowry (of the original, Shivers, I Drink Your Blood, etc.) pops up very briefly as one of them. A nice little nod there, and I noticed another potential nod to a similar film, 1984's Impulse, in which contaminated milk leads people to act on their base impulses. A scene of Olyphant running after a mysterious vehicle that has been documenting the carnage mirrors a sequence from that picture. Also of note is Maxime Alexandre's gorgeous cinematography. Eisner was smart in getting him, as he's done equally stellar work for Alexandre Aja in the past. Thankfully, the use of CGI is minimal. In fact, I don't believe any pops up until the end, and when we get to that, it actually works just fine.The film is peppered with a number of suitably tense set-pieces, particularly one involving a pitchfork, a scene in a car wash and the aforementioned ending. On the downside, there are a few cheap jump scares thrown in. The music also struck me as being rather pedestrian at times. Overall though, I can safely say I'll be returning to this one more often than the 1973 effort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Firstly, I have to say this would make a great Double Feature with Nathan Fillian's Slither. I think they would make a rockin' pair - that or possibly Stephen King's The Mist.At any rate, this is a fun film that offers all the action/suspense/horror that movies like this are supposed to do. And it does that pretty darn well. One of the strongest points are the filming itself. This film moved nicely between heavy and lighter scenes. Some of the shots are both memorable and downright amazing. The people behind the cameras knew what they were doing. The characters were a little light, but likable and played well by their actors. I felt suspense, which is rare for me these days.Downsides:A. The plot jumps a little too quicklyB. Would have liked to see more "crazy"C. A couple scenes were a little clichéD. Oh darn! It's a re-make.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing more than a comfortable exercise in modern film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This latest doppelgänger of the horror genre can very easily be read as a formalistic adventure that takes its heart and soul from the 1973 film of the same name, and directed by, no less, George A. Romero. This new adaptation fairs well in the predictability arena and holds no punches when it comes to packing any surprises. It is not so much that it is a regeneration movie but that now we have become too staid within the confines of this genre within the last three decades or so.Then, the new age of horror movie makers such as Romero, David Cronenberg (Shivers-1975, Rabid-1977), Wes Craven (The Last House on the Left-1972) to Abel Ferrara (The Driller Killer-1979) was, literally, scaring the hell out of their newfound audiences with breaking down the barriers of conformity. Today, with the remake horror genre that has spread so quickly like a virus across our cinema screens, the horror genre has now turned into pastiche and repetitive, formalistic cliché. Breck Eisner's work here is no different.It's a fair attempt and does, occasionally, exactly what it sets out to do, to scare the viewer, but, in the same breath it also has no deep seated anxiety attached to it, no deep rooted connection for any of its players' in so much that we are not given the opportunity to bond, and ultimately, mourn their passing. The prime example here is the family brunt to death in their home and particularly "the man with the garden fork" and his killing of those strapped to the bed, there is just no tension to highlight the severity of the situation, no personal anguish for those in need. The whole setup from its first frame is all so predictable as to the mans own fate that the whole sequence becomes just a passing moment that only succeeds to pass one sequence to another with obvious conclusion. With experience, and hindsight, we know better than to judge this as nothing more than middle-of-the-road horror, that shares the same ethos as its contemporises and this too lets itself down. Apart from everything else in contention, there was just no gain in its ploy not to evolve it players in a deeper and richer relationship with its audience. If there had been more time available, would we be feeling pity for those strapped to their hospital beds, burnt in their homes or exterminated and thus highlighting the need to feel less distant and indifferent, and too, feeling more in shock and disgust in their demise? Is this the premise of what "horror" is, to lets its audience "feel" shocked? To enter into their subconscious? Instead of relying, at times, only on the sensationalistic visuals of shallow character development and jump-scares to maximise an all too a shallow experience that fills the air with empty chances and unimaginative prose?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not your run of the mill horror movie, The Crazies is a respectfully updated version of the original. It's not about blowing stuff up and gore and frightening chills but truly about surviving the errors and mistakes that have been created by the US. All from a downed plane. You enjoy the visual and the change of pace as our protagonists dodge 'crazies' and the military. It all works and falls into place, which is funny because some movies can get away with that yet most don't. The Crazies is what I hoped 28 Days Later would have been essentially and I recommend the film for fans of the zombie genre. With the exception of some overlength, the wit and intelligence of the script will give the film some decent legs, if not on screen, then guaranteed in the long run. &nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that crazy about this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't that thrilled by this movie. Most of the action scenes were one person vs one person which was kind of sad to me. There weren't many triage situations which I like to see in a big motion picture. I believe its alright for horror movies to slightly break away from logic and reason, however, when "crazy" people start logically working together, it makes me think they are not that crazy. I couldn't tell, maybe that is what the director was going for? Either way, berserk psychopaths should not be working together reasonably. The acting was atrocious and the entire movie is nothing compared to a George Romero film, and I have seen them all. The movie was entirely predictable and unoriginal to say the least. Don't waste your time or money on this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The Crazies" (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crazies" is not scary."Horror" has come to mean something very specific to Hollywood, and perhaps more than any other genre, is withering from a lack of creativity. The horror film should unnerve, disorient, and startle?qualities that evaporate when imitated. The formulaic scare tactics of "The Crazies" and its contemporaries are so well established that their effect on audiences now is negligible. It's compounded by the remake phenomenon, and though you can put a fresh coat of paint on a forty-year-old film, can you really expect it to frighten anybody?I suspect fans of the genre aren't even showing up to be scared anymore. How can they be? They know the rules. What passes for great horror today is really 'horrortainment:' competent atmosphere and innovative gore slapped on an obvious template. And such has been the reaction to "The Crazies," which has a relatively high 72% Rotten Tomatoes metascore, based on 130 reviews. The consensus is that the film is "uncommonly intelligent," without reference to the embarrassingly low mean intellect of 21st century horror.And "The Crazies" does have competent atmosphere, though it's merely that. Following a promising start, the film still suffers from the stilted predictability that plagues the genre at its worst, and it shouldn't be praised for performing above a very low average, especially when nothing interesting happens after the first twenty minutes.There's a gravity to act one, before the meddlesome government steps in and f***s up the film, with attention paid to the fact that the Crazies are our (suddenly creatively homicidal) friends and neighbors. There's your movie: what does it mean to be brutally attacked by the people you love? Why don't we leave it at that and do away with this trite big brother/quarantine shtick? All it nets us is regurgitated social commentary, a half-hearted compound escape sequence, and a film that's approximately 30% walking.And the walking dissolves into more walking, which is intermittently punctuated with exactly the sort of scenes you would expect in a post-apocalyptic zombie flick. Where do we go? Is one of our party members infected? Why don't you wait in this dimly-lit diner alone while I go do something important?An occasional effective jump scare, menacing visual, and suspenseful moment aren't enough to make up for a wholly second-rate script. It all goes back to that first sentence. "The Crazies" is not scary. And it's not scary just because it doesn't surprise us, but also because it exists in a world without consequence. Early in the film, a son and his mother stow away in a coat closet to hide from her infected husband. When dad finds them, he doesn't yank them out?He locks them in and sets the house on fire.Okay, you got me?Now what? We cut out of the scene and never see any of the characters again. What? If you really want to horrify me, stick me in that closet with the burning family. Let me feel the smoke inhalation and smell the singed flesh.Like comedy and laughter, if a horror film finds a way to frighten this jaded moviegoer, I'm more than willing to overlook its flaws elsewhere. But the last thing I should ever feel is comfortable?No, scratch that. The last thing I should ever feel is bored, and "The Crazies" is a boring film. It's objectively a step above "Legion" or "The Wolfman," but I suppose that's what passes for praise in the current horror climate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The title could describe those who think this film is good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A murky and unnecessary remake of George Romero's Vietnam-era original that could have improved upon Romero's talky gore fest, but it quickly becomes a long- winded and repetitive chase without much suspense and even less originality. All too often, the music cues up, something leaps out and so it goes and goes and goes. The film would have benefited from a slow, eerie build-up where things are gradually revealed to be off kilter, but the film pretty much plunges into the action with minimal characterization providing little reason to care. The script might make a decent Twilight Zone episode, but as a feature film it becomes tiring long before the end. Unfortunately, The Crazies wastes a good premise and decent actors. You'd be crazy to waste your time and money on it. There's not a single original or memorable moment in the entire forgettable mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not-so-well-plotted piece of claptrap that made me want to retch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, "The Crazies" stunk.I was satisfied after a strong opening 20 minutes, but then it sunk like the Titanic (the boat, not the movie, lol)! It slowly transformed from thoughtful and intriguing (like an old "Twilight Zone" episode) to resorting to cheap scares (loud BOOM out of nowhere that would awaken someone out of a coma) and "saved at the last second" scenes. One "saved at the last second" scene could have been predicted by a blind Stevie Wonder! Sheriff and Deputy arrive at a house. Sheriff goes one way, the Deputy another. Sheriff gets "cheap-scared" after searching an empty room, a loud boom noise from the movie's Score, then turns around to a pair of sneaky (and previously QUIET) zombies! After a struggle, a few bullets shot, and the nozzle of a gun pointed right at the Sheriff...quick shot of the gun, quick shot of the scared Sheriff, quick shot of the gun, another shot of the Sheriff who's resigned to death...then guess what? BOOM! The trusty Deputy is there to save the day, pulling the trigger at the very last moment! Wow, I couldn't have seen that one coming! (And to top it off, he somehow had the angle -- and the viewpoint to see what the heck was going on upstairs -- to shoot the zombie in the heart from the front lawn!) Lots of corny lines (when pointing a gun at the Sheriff, the Deputy says "ONE...TWO...THREE...that's how many times I saved your life!") and unbelievable situations continue.Small points also make little sense. One of the zombies, at the beginning stages of becoming a zombie, actually gets taken to the doctor. After reacting extremely strangely to the doctor, so strange that the doctor should consider hospitalization or getting mental experts involved, she basically says to the family "Have him take two of these and call me in the morning"! Guy goes home and proceeds to kill his family. Doctor, after a complete swing and a miss on the diagnosis, takes no responsibility for the deaths whatsoever. Movie moves on. Blah.The movie isn't entirely without merit though. I thought it was actually well-made from a technical standpoint. The actors, though inexperienced, showed a passion for acting. After the 2005 debacle that was "Sahara", one of the least memorable movies in modern history, Director Brent Eisner finally got a job 5 years later...and I he did well in his return. He should do fine being at the helm for "Flash Gordon" in 2012.The Crazies...great start then descends into mediocrity at best. See it at your own peril!JD (LittleShopOfPosters.com &gt;&gt; Coming soon!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen It All Before Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of THE CRAZIES is one of the most disturbing films ever made . I've seen a lot of violent films in my time but George A Romero's film sticks in my memory due to its political context . It's a Vietnam war movie transferred to America where the government and military have to destroy America in order to save America . It's also a film that gives us no one to root for as both the towns folk and soldiers engage on an orgy of destruction . If there's any sympathetic character it's the army officer who finds himself stuck between a rock and a hard place but as for the rest of the characters they're so unsympathetic an audience will find the original so alienating as to be unwatchable which led to THE CRAZIES meeting lukewarm box office in 1973 Thankfully this remake doesn't make any political statements which would have been very difficult due to the support of the American public of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan . The heroes are the standard all clean cut pillars of middle American society a couple of law enforcement officers and a couple of doctors and soldiers aren't portrayed as trigger happy thugs. This is the big difference between the original and the remake - it's the uninfected humans who are the good guys while the infected zombies who are the villains of the piece which makes it a far more commercial and accessible movie to a mainstream audience. The battle lines are clear cut and this isn't necessarily a problem What is a problem is this version suffers from a seen it all before feel . It opens with an establishing shot of a burning town and cuts to a caption of The Crazies at the bottom right hand corner of the screen againsta black background very similar to the title caption of 28 DAYS LATER . In truth 28 WEEKS LATER is the natural successor of Romero's 1973 version THE CRAZIES featuring a plot with a heavy political subtext where characters having to protect themselves against the American military and infected hordes alongside strong imagery . The 2010 remake of THE CRAZIES is merely a run of the mill horror thriller deliberately lacking any subtext or historical context and while it won't alienate an audience becomes very forgettable</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A transport plane crashes into the water supply of a small Iowa town. Some of the townfolks become infected and turn crazed killers. Sheriff (Timothy Olyphant), his wife (Radha Mitchell), his deputy (Joe Anderson), and a girl from town (Danielle Panabaker) need to escape not only the crazies, but also the military sent to contain the population.This is remake of a George A. Romero movie. It's not that complicated. It is a horror movie done classically without the jokey references or overt sexualization. There are no gross out jokes or T&amp;A. It is just simple tense horror done right. The scariest scene has to be the women tied down on the gurneys, and a crazy walks in. If you want simple horror, this is all you need.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this film so much, to me it is completely original! I've seen some other people saying that this film is unoriginal, and i don't agree. I admit the virus epidemic in zombie films is quite repetitive, but i suppose it has to be...how else could we turn into zombies? But anyway, this film has something that's different. The zombies we usually see, are the ones that stumble slowly towards you, and simply want to eat your flesh. These zombies are not like that (if you can even call them zombies) the infected 'Crazies' in this film aren't brain dead, they don't generally look any different (apart from the slight rotting flesh, but lets ignore that), they don't particularly move any differently, and they can speak perfectly fine...which may be the eeriest part. The infected just want to kill. Which makes them, in my opinion, some of the scariest 'zombies' in any film. Great movie that i can watch over and over and still be freaked out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting a ton from this, and honestly only recently became interested in it. Not having watched the original(I wouldn't mind doing so, I like Romero a lot), I can't make any comparisons. I agree with those that put forth that this doesn't go anywhere the genre hasn't been before, and that the presentation itself doesn't either, however, it is a largely solid entry(that certainly delivers), and that deserves recognition. This is intense from start to finish. The reason it is, and why it works, is that character development and build-up of atmosphere are smooth and occur as a by-product of what happens. Instead of slowing down in pace to flesh anyone out or very clearly set something up, it manages to do both in a natural way. It feels realistic, to an extent. This is terrifying, eerie and creepy. There are a handful of cheap tricks used, and there are many jump scares. Not everything leads anywhere, though the pay-offs tend to be marvelous. I applaud the psychology that does make it into this; some paranoia and you do get glimpses of the impact it has on people to be in an unnerving situation for a long time. The dialog has great moments. Editing and cinematography are mostly good, with a few exceptions where you can't quite tell what's going on. The FX are excellent in all respects. There is plenty of bloody violence(at times brutal) and disturbing content, a little gore(nearly invariably impeccably effectively used), and occasional strong language in this, and none of it is gratuitous. I recommend this to every fan of horror. Not an action flick, not a revolutionary piece, but definitely an enjoyable trip to the cinema. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crazies (1:41, R) ? Borderline, 3rd string, remakePretty sad that this retread is the best SF&amp;F film of 2010 so far, tho still not one that I'd really recommend. Here Timothy Olyphant, in a big-screen stopover on his way between portraying a sheriff in HBO's Deadwood and a sheriff in FX's Justified, is cast against type as ? a sheriff.The film wastes no time getting right into the meat of the story, as the opening scene shows a town in flames, littered with wrecked vehicles. We cut quickly to "2 days earlier", opening day of baseball season in the little town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa (pop. 1260), as Rory Hamill, the town drunk ? expressionless, disheveled, wearing grimy overalls ? walks onto the field with a shotgun. The players scatter, and Pierce County Sheriff David Dutton (who apparently knows everyone in town on a 1st-name basis) walks out to calm Rory down and persuade him to put down the gun. It doesn't end well.Over the ensuing day or so, a number of other town residents start exhibiting strange behavior: subdued, listless, forgetful. Some of them show up in the office of the town doc, Judy Dutton (Radha Mitchell), the sheriff's pregnant wife. But she can't find anything wrong with them beyond a slightly elevated temperature, and they agree. "{My wife} worries too much. I'm fine. Just a little tired.", says one man. Then, moments later, he says it again. He'll be the next one to wig out.Intercut among the scenes of tranquil rural life are quick shots from satellite recon cameras and, later, from inside a mysterious black SUV with tinted windows. This gives us reason to think that there's more going on than, say, H2N2. This is confirmed about the time the sheriff does a little detective work to discover that the craziness is probably due to contaminated water flowing downstream from the village's eponymous marsh, and the overhead view gets an ominous new caption: "Initiate containment procedures".From there on, it's the sheriff, his wife, his chief deputy (Joe Anderson as the decidedly non- Barney-Fife-like, competent, reliable Russell Clank), and teenage candy-striper Becca Darling (Danielle Panabaker) against the crazies themselves, vengeful relatives, panicky townspeople, well armed rednecks, and hordes of gas-masked soldiers who themselves aren't quite sure what they've been ordered to do but aren't about to take any lip from civilians, badge or no.Things go to hell pretty realistically, there aren't any unbelievable heroics or faky jumpatchas, and there's a serious effort made to field a plausible scientific explanation for everything. Indeed, that very plausibility prompts me to classify this film as borderline, rather than pure SF, since it's something that arguably could happen in real life.Does it all turn out OK in the end? That would be telling, wouldn't it?George A. Romero executive produced this remake of his 1973 film of the same name, which was set in Pennsylvania. (You may recognize him as the man behind the original 1968 Night of the Living Dead and its many remakes and sequels. Apparently he's a guy who believes in milking the cow until she implodes.) I never saw the original, so I can't say whether it meets my standard test for whether a remake is justified, namely that the original idea was poorly executed but worthy of being done right.The 2010 edition, considered all by itself, is reasonably good but by no means a must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight Horror/Thriller to be seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake takes the plot line of classic horror story and elevates it above the norm for the genre with the use of tight pacing, good acting and great cinematography.This is a tried-and-true formula movie of friends and neighbors strangely turning into murderous "zombies" due to some unknown infection and how our heroes survive despite all odds. The original was made in 1973 and, true to the era, casts the government as the bad guys - having created this infection as a biological weapon. The original movie split the point-of-view between the townspeople and the government agents so the plot was more apparent from both sides. The remake keeps the same antagonist but does not try to reveal the government's plans or voice the government's justification for the actions undertaken. The result is that the heroes and the audience are kept in the dark for a longer period and the tensions are increased accordingly.One point of differentiation between this movie and other "zombie" movies is that the creatures do not seek to eat the flesh of the humans (thereby reducing the gore factor but there is still plenty of scene that are unsettling) and retain a sense of their actions (allowing them to seek revenge and work in teams). Yes, teams of zombies working together. Scary.While I generally do not like horror movies, I would almost classify this more as a thriller with some sic-fi and horror elements. And the elements work quite well together.For my other movie reviews, please visit:https://nomorewastedmovienights.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful And Even Frightening At Times, But I Thought It Peaked Too Early</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie - somewhat to my own surprise to be honest because, for whatever reason, I wasn't expecting a lot out of it. It's quite exciting, it doesn't really have a lot of gratuitous gore (what violence and bloodshed there is fits into the story) and there's a moderate amount of suspense involved in whether the leads (Timothy Olyphant playing the sheriff and Radha Mitchell playing his wife and the town doctor) are going to be able to find a way out of this mess.They find themselves in the middle of a nightmare when a government plane crashes and - unknown to the local population - spreads a biological weapon that was on its way to be destroyed and whose intent is to "destabilize" local populations. It does this by turning them extremely violent and basically turning them into homicidal maniacs so that they begin killing each other off. The government seals the town off in an attempt to contain the virus and David and Judy (Olyphant and Mitchell) along with a handful of other survivors are left trying to find a way to escape. (This actually reminded me a little bit of the vampire thriller "30 Days Of Night" with a handful of people trying to survive an insane situation, except with no vampires.)This is pretty good all the way through. It doesn't need any more set-up than what I've already written; the plot is pretty straightforward and simple. My only criticism might be that for me the most heart-pumping, climactic scene came way too early; less than halfway through the movie. That was the scene in the funeral home, where David finds the funeral director and minister attacked and is then confronted himself by one of "the crazies" - which is how the government refers to those infected. There are exciting scenes after that, of course, but somehow the movie settled into more of a routine after that funeral home scene and never quite regained the chill of that moment. It's a good movie, though, with an ending that leaves everything pretty much open and makes you wonder how this is going to be stopped. (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong I love the zombie/infection genre and there's nothing I love more than blood, guts, and...well, more blood and guts but this movie just fell short for me. It seems like every zombie/infection movie story has been expired for the past few years, Zombieland being an exception...kinda.The Crazies starts off, well, crazy and ends crazies, which that's probably why it's call that in the first place. This movie display a rather generic story. Everything is normal, stuff hits the fan, military comes, military loses control, main characters make a journey to a better place, and bomb hits infected town. I'm not saying I hate this clone of a story mainly because they aren't really "zombies" but the same diagram applies.This movie was bad and it wasn't good. It was slightly above average and that's not too shabby in my book to begin with so. They didn't try anything original but one of the aspects was a tad different which ain't to shabby either. Originality is really what made this movie not as good for me.Rating: 7/10 Final Words: If you like zombie/infection movies then go and rent it. If you don't watch movies that aren't a 8 or more in rating then this movie might not be for you.</fullReview>

The film was very boring and suspense was awful and the film had a terrible storyline. A harrier crashes into their lake and everyone gets infected by drinking the water...sounds like a Cabin fever / dawn of the dead ripoff. I did enjoy the nuke at the end and the cliffhanger ending but other than that seemed like another movie a saw in September called carriers :P. The acting was terrible the other cop randomly killing people because he was infected and made the films plot seem empty. However I would like to see others people input about this film. Did it really deserve a 7? I think not more like a 5...another film that is no longer advertised being 7 days after their release and will just seem to be in the value bin at blockbuster in the next 5 months</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa, a farmer does his chores, friendly neighbors greet each other, and American flags wave peacefully outside just about every building. The town Sheriff, David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), is at the local baseball diamond to cheer on wholesome, clean-cut high school baseball team. The serene mood is interrupted when the town drunk suddenly comes walking onto the field with a loaded shotgun in his hand. David tries to reason with the man, but he is unresponsive to his words and raises his gun. David is able to raise his gun first and fires, killing the man in front of everyone.David feels remorse for his action, and doesn't know what to say when the man's grief-stricken wife and teenage son confront him. He assumed the incident was brought on by the man's alcohol problem, but the wife insists he had been sober for two years. These opening moments intrigued me, and made me think I had stumbled upon the rare, thoughtful and character-driven horror film, but the plot speeds right on ahead, and introduces us to the Sheriff's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), who is the town doctor. She too has a strange incident with a despondent and unresponsive man who is brought in for an examination by the man's concerned wife. She can't see anything physically wrong with him, despite his odd behavior, and sends him home to rest. That same night, the man ends up locking his wife and young child in the closet before he sets the house on fire with them inside it. It's a chilling scene to be sure, and it would have been even more so if the film had slowed down to actually let us feel for the people these things were happening to. Instead, the plot plows on ahead once more.Are you noticing a pattern here? The Crazies keeps on setting up interesting and terrifying situations, then just moves right on along. It'd be one thing if the movie was hurrying along to something truly interesting, but director Breck Eisner eventually settles down into a predictable series of non-stop jump scares. After the early promise, we get a fairly typical plot for this sort of film. We find out that the town's water supply has become tainted, and is turning the people slowly into mindless and murderous creatures. The military quickly swoops in and seals off the town, killing anyone on sight who shows any sign of illness. The film is a remake of a 1973 horror film by George Romero, and it feels like a remake, because you constantly feel like you've seen it all before. David and Judy try to escape from the town and the military forces with the help of David's Deputy (Joe Anderson) and a young woman from Judy's office named Becca (Danielle Panabaker). All the while, they're constantly menaced by people who have succumbed to the disease ("the crazies" of the title), who all act exactly like every single generic monster villain that's ever walked, lurched, or slithered across the silver screen.This really had the potential to be so much more. Aside from a scene where young Becca sees her boyfriend get gunned down and incinerated by the military, we never really get a sense of the tragedy of the situation. We don't know anything about the townspeople, or who they really were before the disease hit. The script by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright starts out smart, and offers some genuine thrills. But then the whole thing goes on autopilot in the second half, and I found myself losing interest little by little, until I just didn't care anymore. The movie stops being tense and scary as well at this point. I'm tired of horror movies that rely solely on things jumping out for their scares. They don't even provide a good jolt, since we pretty much can sense a set up for an attack from a mile away.At least I can complement the movie on a technical level. It's very well made for a film of its kind. The vast cornfields and desolate streets do give a small sense of isolation that I wish the movie was smart enough to utilize more. The cast also manage to wring out as much personality as they can out of their thinly written characters. At least none of the heroes are annoying. In movies like this, there's usually one character that you hope will get chomped by the monsters or shot by the army, but no such feelings were stirred within me here.I tried my hardest to hold onto the early feelings of intrigue and enjoyment I felt during the first 40 minutes or so watching The Crazies. I eventually found myself wishing that Woody Harrelson's character from Zombieland would show up and liven things. If ever there was a movie that needed a guy who still knew how to have fun when modern society is collapsing all around him, it's this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1) Crazies will often turn on a big ass tractor to lure family members out of the house so they can wait until they go back into said house to kill them anyway, but not before looking through a keyhole to make sure.2) No D-grade movie is complete without the obligatory "We need a funeral home because it's scary - put some sheets on those bodies!" 3) If a crazy happens to have its eyes stitched shut, don't worry - it will tell you to turn around to avoid certain death...the moment you cut its lips free! 4) Crazies will always kill you except if they surprise you in a baby's room where they will magically find tape and rope and meticulously tie you up.5) As an addendum to #4, said crazy will be miraculously shot from the outside of the house through a window with a 4 inch gap in the shades...just seconds from your certain death.6) A crazy is sure to try and stab you with a pitchfork...that is up until it gets shot seconds before doing so. Again.7) Government soldiers are easily persuaded to not give you up after you bash them in the head and tell them your wife is a doctor and that you are a sheriff.8) Apache helicopters have the most advanced electronics and surveillance in the world, but you can escape it by driving a car into a car wash...but be careful because they will fire on you once you drive out...but not until you exit the car first (they can't track you, don't worry!) 9) As an addendum to #8, there are usually tons of crazies hanging out inside of an abandoned car wash because...they like to clean cars...and stuff ;) 10) If you are going to commit suicide-by-military after your infection had it's own timetable unlike all the other infected, make sure to wear a bullet proof vest right before doing so...it will save yo...oh, never mind.11) People still tend to boo if a movie is bad.Well, I had free passes so nothing gained, nothing lost ('cept two hours!) SAVE your $$$. This has been a public service announcement!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just Another Bad Zombie Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>$7.00 for the ticket, $9.25 for the popcorn and drink. I should have bought the popcorn and drink and gone home to watch a better movie, 'cause this one sucked. The Crazies is basically about people who turn into zombies because their water is contaminated with toxin. Other things happen but I won't bother to explain them because I would die of boredom.I love horror movies, but 90% of them are as bad as this one. A good horror movie builds up the tension and never lets go. The Crazies builds tension for no more than a few seconds, and then releases it with a gun shot, an explosion, or someone getting stabbed with a pitchfork. It definitely will make you jump a few times, but it won't make you scared.I can't figure out how movies like this make it to the theaters, and I really can't figure out why I go to see them. But if you normally like horror movies no matter what, then this might be for you. If you are like me and like your scary movies to actually be scary, then skip this one and rent a DVD of Halloween, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or A Nightmare on Elm Street. If you're like most of America and won't watch a movie that was made before 2000, then go get The Descent, The Ring, or Paranormal Activity. Just don't go see The Crazies.http://franklinreviews.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pros - A few good scares, but nothing original.Cons - Trite -- Not enough scares -- Incredibly weak plot -- Stupid characters who deserve to die -- Some of the infected are much more intelligent than the characters you're supposed to be rooting for. They can actually organize and complete tasks whereas the characters make unbelievably ridiculous choices -- The main characters come into contact with blood and other internal fluids of the infected so many times but apparently the virus is rather difficult to catch and is actually quite choosy about it's hosts -- Timothy Olyphant never once takes his shirt off</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When residents of a small-town begin attacking each other, the survivors are lead away from the area, but when they learn of others still trapped in the town they head back to rescue them before they fall victim to the bloodthirsty creatures.This was a hard one to get a handle on as there's stuff to love and dislike here. Some of the stuff works, from the build-up in the beginning with the family being stalked in the house before it being set on fire to the gory ambush in the morgue, there's some nice action scenes early on that create a pretty creepy air especially when combined with the investigation angle. The assault on the camp as well as the action in the burned-out ruins of the town are rather nice and certainly big, fun action scenes that provide some nice blood and gore, and it gets a lot of fun out of an abbreviated ambush in a car-wash and a truck- stop encounter, but the fact remains that there's a lot of problems here. The biggest flaw is that the middle segments, after a strong opening, just drain the energy from the film as it continually repeats the tender family relationship that never once feels threatened or in danger, despite attempts to force the issue but it knowingly won't and just renders the whole thing pointless. Also, by dropping the number of encounters down it leaves the relentless pacing of the first half incredibly slowed down and dull afterward, drawing out the film a little too long in this section. Another big serious flaw is the complete and total lack of explanations for the toxin dropped in the town, which is a real mystery on all fronts in how it works, its' purpose and wherever the toxin came from. This is a major flaw which really hampers the film along with its other flaws as otherwise, this is a decent effort.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker star in this 2010 sci-fi/horror remake of George Romero's 1973 film. This takes place in Pierce County, Iowa and Olyphant (Scream 2) plays Sheriff, David who has a wife, Judy (Mitchell), a doctor. Soon, some of the town's residents commit violent acts of murder and David learns they're infected by an unknown virus created by the military that's contaminated the water supply. When the town becomes contained, David and Judy fight to survive. Anderson plays David's Deputy, Russell and Panabaker (Friday the 13th) plays Judy's assistant, Becca. This isn't bad, the cast is decent and there's good make-up effects. I recommend this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always do my best to go into a film with an open mind and leave most preconceived baggage out of the experience, but The Crazies had so much that had me sharpening my knives to eviscerate it. Directed by a nepotism flyweight, who's daddy used to run Disney and directed one of the biggest flops of the decade - a remake of a less than stellar George Romero film - a title that just sounds silly on a slick studio production and sounds designed for cheap exploitation - a cast capable of good work, but with careers of varying quality control. So it was a complete surprise that The Crazies is a damn fine horror film. It's well directed, acted and has a mounting sense of dread, as well as some humor. There's no fat on this film and the mayhem begins from the first scene. The surveillance effects during the first 15 minutes or so are unnecessary and a crazed man terrorizing his family before setting the house on fire, has plenty of familiar horror tropes that you've seen a thousand times - but those are minor complaints. Most of what unfolds plays out well, even with a few bumps along the way - a visit back to our two leads home where a hostage situation takes place should have been cut. There are some great set pieces, especially one involving some serious misuse of a pitchfork. The Crazies delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You don't have to be crazy to watch this (but it helps)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Crazies' (2010) is a remake of zombie-maestro George A Romero's 'other' film from the seventies. Most people only know him in connection with his Night/Dawn/Day/Land quadrology, but he also made The Crazies back in the early seventies. It was basically a zombie film by another name; instead of the undead you had people infected (in the non 28 Days Later kind of way) with a contamination which basically meant they go nuts (or crazy, basically).If you've seen the other remake of George A Romero's 'Dawn of the Dead (2004)' then you should kind of know the 'look and feel' of the Crazies' remake. It sort of feels like a compendium piece to Dawn's remake, even down to having a Johnny Cash song over the opening credits.We have a place crashing a toxic chemical which gets in a small American town's water supply, making everyone start killing each other. Naturally the Government is on hand to generally mess things up for the hapless townsfolk who have already started to murder each other in various grisly ways.The story follows the sheriff, his doctor wife, his deputy and another girl as they desperately try to flee the town while being pursued by nut-jobs, the government and the paranoia that one or more of them may well be infected.It's not the most mind-blowing of premises, but it does the job. It's not original enough to really stand out. I suppose the most different aspect to it is that the 'infected' or 'non-zombies' (or whatever you want to call them) do still retain enough intelligence to generally act a little difference to your average undead menace (you don't get too many zombies driving cars and firing shotguns at our heroes!).If you're generally into your zombie movies then this one will do the job. It has enough of a budget to raise it above the bucketload of B-movies who are using the 'zombie craze' to sell itself and the cast, although nothing out of the ordinary, do enough to make us root for them.Nothing too memorable, but nothing too awful and will certainly entertain any horror fan for an hour and a half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: The Crazies Condensed Storyline: Remake of the 1973 movie of the same title. A small town in Iowa has their water supply infected with a biological toxin which causes everyone to go insane. Notable Acting: The focus sits more on the three main protagonists of David, Judy and Russell than the fact of zombies, but this movie is similar to the TV show 'The Walking Dead' as the movie is more about what the people do when they are faced with odds of this kind compared to just focusing on the zombies. Noticeable Camera work:Graphics: The CGI nuclear explosion was nicely done, being the only piece of CGI in the movie. Incorrect Science: The sheriff pulls a new Zippo lighter from a box on display, he lights it first time. Zippo lighters are stored without lighter fluid for safety reasons. Drinking water isn't used for watering crops as drinking water is too 'soft' for plants. The light from the nuclear blast would have blinded the survivors as they tried to look at it, this is why scientists wear blackout goggles to protect their eyes while they are looking at nuclear explosions. Nuclear explosions cause inverted windstorms as the air rushes to the explosion site to fill the vacuum created by the super heat air rising. The EMP created by the blast would fry all electronics near it, causing the truck's headlights to stop working Overall Feel: I am generally not all too much of a zombie movie fan, but this is one of those movies which I like because it shows how far people will go to survive, this movie also has a similar vibe to '28 Days Later' showing how the Military have responded to this outbreak as well. I enjoyed the characters in this movie and I enjoyed the plot. There isn't much I downgrade this movie for, apart from not having all too many creative angles and have a few pieces of incorrect science. It is a good horror thriller movie, but there isn't too much thriller aspect to it as I do not fear for the safety of David or the main characters, as I know they are going to make it out alive, but in saying this I was surprised to see Russell get killed towards the end, but I was expecting it at the same time as he was too much of a loose cannon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most Definitely One of the Best Thrillers Around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've had the HD version for years now, but I had not watched it until now, because I got the Full HD version, and I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was. The movie is very to the point and unlike most other horror movies it doesn't take 45 minutes for the "horror" to begin, although as the story unfolds it becomes more and more thrilling. It has some really exciting sequences that would make you hold your breath for a while until you feel some sort of pain in your chest (for not breathing properly for at least 30 minutes!) The acting is superb, the actors and actresses are all likable and pretty / handsome, and their actions are logical, not the stupid kind you see in most other horror movies, which make you think the characters deserve to die because of their stupidity. When the characters are in danger you can feel it and you want them to survive! The ending was fantastic as well, predictable, but good nonetheless. This is one of the best thrillers I've seen in a long time and I strongly recommend it to all horror movie fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely worthy of the original and yet stands entirely on it's own.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a remake is done right, you can feel it from the get go. This is truly one of those movies. I'm not really going to write any spoilers here, I always tick that box in case I let something slip. Writing spoilers for this movie wouldn't be right, you really just need to sit down switch off the lights and watch the film for yourself. Once you do, it's going to wind up being a movie you'll watch again and again. Personally I've already watched it fourteen times. Almost as much as I've watched the original version from 1973. Those earlier Romero movies like Dawn of the Dead (1978) are a bit of an acquired taste because their so dated now, but with this remake of the Crazies there's no need to be a Romero fan and no need to watch the original first. It stands entirely on it's own and I love it for that. The film is loaded with suspense and gripping moments, yet everything in it is entirely plausible. You won't find any of those "as if" moments that are so common in horror today.The acting is solid. The direction, editing and script are fantastic as is the casting and the story. Timothy Olyphant (of FX's Justified) excels in the lead role and the entire supporting cast backs him exceptionally well. From beginning to end the movie just keeps coming at you leaving you wondering whose infected and whose going to survive. If you have seen the original version, the ending of this remake really fleshes it out and slaps you right in the face...In a good way of course.I highly recommend this movie to horror fans, fans of the disaster and virus sub genres, Romero fans and even those who have no idea who George Romero is. I would also recommend this to any fan of Timothy Olyphant, even if your not into horror at all. I promise you, you will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I still have the habit never to read a brief description of a film in advance, let alone I would watch the trailer. In most cases the most crucial things are being told or shown in such a way that most of the surprises are screwed up more or less. In case of a blockbuster it doesn't really matter in most cases, since the content is usually known. With movies like "The Crazies" you'll start with a complete ignorance and it can sometimes be a pleasant surprise. Based on the movie poster (which I find very intriguing though) and the genre, I was ready to be overwhelmed.I must admit that the opening scene immediately gave me high hopes. Beautifully filmed and subtly supported by an appropriate soundtrack of Johnny Cash ("We'll Meet Again"). The first half hour was extremely good. A beautifully portrayed image of a small town in the U.S.. A village where everyone knows each other, with its traditions. A village where the local police still raises an admonishing finger because somebody is shooting after the hunting season and other trivialities. The main characters are introduced immediately : Sheriff David Napping and his pregnant wife Judy and deputy Russell Clank. The performances of these three were extremely successful.The moment the first signs of an epidemic occur won't take long and is convincing. Slowly the mystery unravels bit by bit and the sheriff and his assistant realize that they're in deep sh*t. And then you realize that it's again a zombie-like/epidemic-catastrophe story. The only difference is that the zombies are not more than comatose residents of the community, who transform into aggressive creatures with a "killing spree" mood after drinking the contaminated water. The fact remains that "The Crazies" is above the standard, compared to other horror movies. It's excellent in terms of imaging, dialogues and acting. But after a while the clichés are piling up in such amount that it eventually starts to irritate.Of course, the army shows up to rectify their mistake. They try to cover this whole mess up and start to wipe this community off the map. The sheriff escapes death an awful lot of times in the nick of time. And as always people make wrong decisions. Why bother telling someone to stay at some place. You know that he/she will eventually leave to have a look at something. Then there are the predictable situations. You know in advance already who ultimately will survive. And the end will be a deja-vu situation in other words everything will start all over again ! The biggest disappointment was the lack of tension. The gore part was absent. Only a heap of dead-bodies and the cold blooded liquidation of civilians by the U.S. army was kind of horrifying. Fake blood was apparently very expensive at that time cause it's used so scarce. And shocking scares were nonexistent. That's why this really wasn't a Horror / Drama to me, but rather a Thriller/Drama. Disillusionment. The end was also disappointing and felt as if they made it up quickly.Final conclusion: not bad, but nothing new. Some haunting images and moments (f.e. the pitchfork) but mostly annoying hackneyed clichés and situations.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George E. Romero when he made 'The Crazies' back in 1973, the people of America went through a rough phase in the early sixties due to the Cold war which predicted an imminent nuclear war and the use of biological weapons as the means of mass destruction. Directors, especially horror movie directors, cashed on the element of fear in the public and gave a visual shape to it with a tinge of their own creativity. The zombie movies churned out by George E. Romero (which ensue because of nuclear fall out or a crashing satellite) were successful because they could speak out the public's fear, one of imminent apocalypse, where there were weapons everywhere, even worse, when man himself was the greatest weapon to his society. The horror then had a meaning and a deep sociological impact too. But the same impact, the same feel is almost absent in today's zombie horror. The claustrophobic "there's no escape" setting isn't enough at all to create the chills, the audience have grown out of the 70&#x2032;s and so have their fears. But there are a few people who still haven't understood the dynamics of the horror audience, like for example, Breck Eisner, who has remade "The Crazies" and set it in a contemporary scenario but doesn't add anything which betters the atmosphere. There's blood, yes, there are zombies, yes, will you be afraid? No! At times a simple, long close up shot of a character (like in the last shot of Hitchcock's "Psycho"- the mother of horrors) is good enough to make the audience wet their anterior ends that're are plastered to the seats. But the filmmakers simply choose to go in the old, tried and tested way without bringing in their contribution of the film (Another notable mention here is "Carriers" which is even lucky to even see the light of the day). In this respect, the 70&#x2032;s to the modern day transition has been done by only one director I know, Alexandre Aja, who has managed to heightened the fears of the late 70&#x2032;s Wes Cravern's "The Hills have Eyes" so much in his 2006 remake that it remains as one of the most authentic horror experiences I have had in recent times. Is anybody listening?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rural town is devastated by the effects of an accidentally unleashed biological weapon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1973 George A. Romero (then formerly director of Night of the Living Dead and soon to direct Dawn of the Dead) made a clever horror film about the effects of biological war called 'The Crazies.' What I remember about the film most distinctly was that there was no telling between sane or insane, right or wrong, and this theme led to the film's brutal anti-climax after the biological agent 'Trixie' and the army sent to stop it had done all the damage they possibly could! The film was almost immediately forgotten, only really given any credit in fact after 'Dawn of the Dead' became an instant classic. It was simply ahead of its time and even now, the subject is still dangerous due to America's questionable military tactics ever since the A-Bomb was dropped.In 2010 Breck Eisner remade 'The Crazies', gave it a contemporary stylistic and moral overhaul, a bigger back yard to play in and gave the script a new sense of direction. I loved it, even after much apprehension about how it would turn out, especially after Zack Snyder's remake of 'Dawn of the Dead' over half a decade before. My only disagreement is that the writers took a very intelligent idea (pitting civilian against soldier and blurring the lines between sanity and insanity) and turned a modern nightmare into more of a dark action film that in my eyes packs less of a punch than the original.A rural town Sheriff and his Doctor wife discover too late that the population is quickly slipping into insanity. Before long, the US Military close in to contain what turns out to be a biological weapon that was initially sent away to be destroyed, only to find that the majority of the town has been infected through the water supply.Falling victim to the army's brutal tactics before being separated from each other, the Sheriff sneaks back into the town to rescue his pregnant wife with the aid of his loyal Deputy, only to find that the military has been overrun by the township, which has gone completely insane as the virus, 'Trixie,' has proved more deadly than the army could have hoped for.What results is a horror road movie set in the middle of nowhere, reminiscent of modern adaptations such as 'Dawn of the Dead' and '30 Days of Night.' The only difference is that you're meant to wonder who is the greatest threat, the victims of the maddening biological weapon or the army and the government the characters ought to be able to trust!? The film has an almost perfect lead male in Timothy Olyphant, who up until now has played only bad guys and victims (except for the Hit-man adaptation) in action films and horrors such as 'A Man Apart' and 'Dreamcatcher.' But there is no denying that almost all of the writing effort has gone into him and left the rest of the cast to just follow suit.Rhada Mitchell, who plays his wife, just does what she does in every other film I've seen her in (Pitch Black and Silent Hill) and that is look good playing scared and angry and emotionally drained and on edge etc. The strongest supporting role is provided by Joe Anderson who plays Olyphant's Deputy; a man who you root for from start to finish although his train of thought may seem questionable even before the virus hits town. Between he and Olyphant there is a constantly thinning thread of trust throughout and a reocurring theme of paranoia as would be expected but it is played out very intelligently here.Eisner is clearly a talented director with an eye for devastation, suspense and the macabre and he takes full advantage of what is at his disposal here and delivers more than a punch. Less hardened horror film fans will have no doubt got their kicks out of this but as a horror fan who appreciates volumes of intelligent plotting and intrigue, I found that this remake only fell at the last hurdle trying to take the easy way out rather than hitting the audience where it hurts.Watch the original and see what I mean!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to straight away that I expected a bit more out of this film, even while aware that it was being generally described as serviceable to the genre. Its a remake of George Romero's film in the 70's of the same name that I have yet to see in order to compare the two.Now, I have a respect for George Romero, and god knows I love a good zombie flick, but the sad truth is that the same damn plot devices aren't going to do it for me anymore. I realize that if a large portion of a population becomes biologically enraged or rendered undead and psychopathic, you'll expect the trademark "Lets get the hell outta here" and "We're surrounded we have to fight" and all that rot. Yes, there are going to be human beings that may not be infected but are already predisposed to go haywire at the promise of certain horrible death. Yes, there are bound to be zealous militants and ethical power points abound.The reason this film passes as fresh in my mind comes down to the casting; I believe that Timothy Olyphant is one of todays most underutilized leading men as he projects humility and competence especially when charged with enforcing the law. Perhaps he's in danger of being type-casted as "the Sheriff with a heart of gold" (as in the short lived HBO series Deadwood), but its a role he plays well and we would are better off for it. In "The Crazies" he is the badge carrier of a typical close knit small mid west town; Ogden Marsh IA. Oh, and his name is David Dutten.Relatively unknown Radha Mitchell plays his wife, Judy Dutten, the town physician. These are the only two characters we should even care about, because every other character is stock. Victims of a government mishap; a plane carrying a virus meant to destabilize populations crash lands nearby and If your familiar with these scenarios, its easy to envision what happens next. Slowly at first, then more rapidly, the unsuspecting townspeople are infected with the biological weapon and turn on each other in random and sometimes overly playful acts of violence.The government is good at ruining everything, and here it manages to ruin the film. At times when it seems the suspense is building nicely and the implication of an apocalypse settles in, we are bombarded with loud, tension shattering montages of the military stomping around and barking orders as they attempt to contain the virus. The way they treat civilians you wonder why they even bother at all and don't just bomb the whole region like they (spoiler alert) end up doing anyways. We never get to hate them as much as we'd like, because there is no clear villainous figure acting as their voice. I would have rather have spent more time trapped in close quarters with our two leads and allowed them to develop further reasons for me to care about their survival. Olyphant and Mitchell seem to have a chemistry, but the movie is too busy propelling them into danger, and robbing us of much needed dialogue.In the end, "The Crazies" is better fare than much of what passes for horror these days, but falls short as a shining example of its genre. It restrains itself where it shouldn't, and goes a too far with certain elements that should have taken a back seat, if not only to strengthen the kind of dread inherent in a film like this. Breck Eisner is a director still coming into his own, and this film doesn't say anything definitive about his promise beyond technical ability and perhaps an appreciation for subtlety that is lacking in the torture porn arena.Still, its worth a single viewing and a bag of popcorn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but lacking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched the original in my early teens as part of a BBC2 Horror Double bill and being disappointed by it so when this was announced I wasn't bothered one way or the other. I always loved the idea but I think Romero's film didn't live up to it's promise ? though I'm also aware that I wanted something akin to James Herbert's 'The Fog'. However when the trailers started being released I started getting a little more interested in this.Is it good? Yes ? but not perfect.The film has some effectively disturbing scenes ? a man burns his wife and son to death and mows the lawn. A high school principal casually murders bound patients with a pitchfork. These are genuinely chilling scenes because the capture that element of madness that the movie needed. The performances are all pretty good ? even Timothy Olyphant didn't annoy me (he's not a bad actor I just find his performances a wee bit bland) and over all it is an entertaining and tense movie.Where the film is let down is the fact that we don't get to know anything about the town people ? the whole idea of 'your friends, your family' going crazy is a bit lost in that most of the people that get crazy have had either no introduction or a cursory scene where we find out the nurse has a boyfriend etc. I know that it's not possible to get to know everyone but I suspect that the character scenes were filmed and edited out so that the disease started having impact sooner. This is a film where the standard Disaster Movie or Stephen King structure may have served the story well. There was also a bit of an attempt to create paranoia about who of the survivors were going crazy but it was all a bit muddled.I enjoyed the movie but felt it could have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies, a remake of George A. Romero's horrible original, stands the test of horror and actually scares the audience. With constant remakes being thrown at us today (seriously, does Hollywood have any originality left in it?), it is only a matter of time before one of these remakes hits the audience and leaves an impression that even the biggest zombie bite can't take off.The Crazies is about a small town in Iowa called Ogden Marsh, where a plane crashes into the town's water supply and infects the townspeople, turning them into maniacs hell-bent on killing. Sound stupid? Well, it is. But it's the way this film delivers its plot that makes it work. While it could have been just more mindless zombie film drivel (yeah, I know, they're not ZOMBIES, but just get over it already) as seen in Day of the Dead or any other zombie film released in the last 10 years, it tends to stray away from the usual formula. Sure, we've all seen these scares done a million times before, but there's just something exciting about seeing Timothy Olyphant stab a woman in the neck with a knife, isn't there? The characters are all seemingly one-dimensional. None of them really jump off the screen, and the only character I was rooting for throughout the entire film ended up deader than Kentucky Fried Chicken. The downside to this film is that it's predictable. Because the characters aren't deep, they simply become just someone to watch on the screen. We know who is going to die and who is going to live, so when the time comes for someone's untimely death, the drama of the moment is lost because we saw it coming from the very beginning. Also, and I kid you not, all of the scary scenes from the film were revealed in the mesmerizing trailer. When the time comes for a jump scare (and there are LOTS, bad heart people beware), we know it's coming because we saw it in the trailer. Kind of takes away from it, don't you think? That's not to say that these scenes are bad, because they aren't. Many of them are nicely directed, with one or two really original scenes that stood out from the rest of the movie. I just wish the movie took more of these original approaches, because if it did, it would only have been that much better.While we are bombarded with stupid remakes and horrible supernatural films (Twilight) being released, it is a breath of fresh air to see a genuinely scary one. Sure, we've seen these characters a million times before and we've seen these situations in every horror film ever released, but that's not to say this film doesn't do them right. The Crazies knows what it wants to be, and it achieves it. I just wish the film had some more crazy scenes! And yes, this entire review was just a big build up to that horrible pun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What can director Breck Eisner bring to the table in his remake of horror-meister George A. Romero's film The Crazies? As Hollywood's keenly running out of ideas, the plundering of comic book characters and updating movies from the past continues to drive up that sense of desperation, and Eisner doesn't contribute much other than to cosmetically update this for the modern times, the original done more than 30 years ago when he's still a toddler.The person who edited the trailer though, had done a great marketing job in setting expectations that this is something of a huge action fest with the promise of jump-scenes designed to scare, and the marketing folks who came up with the tagline "Fear Thy Neighbor" could be watching a different film altogether. Instead, and thankfully, The Crazies 2010 is more of a brooding piece that relies a lot on a measured pace to create a sense of creepiness, rather than to seek an all out scare reliant on a clichéd bag of tricks. Sadly though for the neighbour bit, we don't get much of a body count or have that literally translated, since it's more of a tale of survival instincts amongst a group desperately trying to make sense of the situation, and get themselves out of it in one piece.We don't get to see or attach ourselves to more than a handful of folks, since the small town of inhabitants, supposedly close knit, stay far apart from one another except when they go downtown. Like almost all contemporary zombie films, the root cause is due to man's folly and carelessness, dabbling in unethical medical and laboratory tests designed to play around with Mother Nature, until an accidental strikes. Here, it's the unfortunate biological/chemical agent outbreak that causes a change in human behaviour, with the military swiftly called in to contain the situation with a town wide quarantine and the permission to use all means necessary to do so.Which translates to indiscriminate killing, and questioning of ethics especially when methods cut too close to genocide. It gives that stark commentary on how those in power tend to carpet sweep all their mistakes because they can, and will not rule out the use of violence to exterminate any opposition and threat that will expose them. It reminds us of the jitters of man when we come face to face with uncertainty and fear, done especially well when the story starts to focus on the survival bits between town sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant), his doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and their respective deputies in Russell (Joe Anderson, in a superb support role like his character) and Becca (Danielle Panabaker) respectively.Don't go in thinking that the Crazies here are superfast like zombies and go running around with great speed. The threat of the Crazies is their unpredictable, violent behaviour without reason, surprisingly still possessing that bit of intellect and mental ability, blessed with tremendous strength though still susceptible to normal weaponry, which makes them easier to dispatch. Kill scenes aren't designed deliberately to be gory, though the one at the morgue and in David's house still have it in them to be nail biting, with scenes like that in the car wash being at the cheesier end of things.Eisner opted for being more peekaboo here than to drench the screen with all out gore. Like films of old this one takes its time to allow the dust to settle for the audience to ponder, but alas despite its very showy special effects laden finale, it's actually nothing more than a competent cosmetic remake, where the real horror is actually the death of original ideas.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really good horror movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched lots of horror movies. In fact watching Poltergeist in 3rd grade of primary school left some years-long memories, causing fear of darkness and invisible evil. Later on, all the movies about zombies (including Shaun of The Dead, which of course is not a bona fide horror movie, but just a scary though absolutely brilliant comedy).This one is a really good horror movie that does not involve gore seen in B and C class horror movies to amplify the scare effect. This movie does it the right way, the horror of extreme insanity of trixie victims is there without exposing viewers to too many unnecessary details. In real life, just a thought that your neighbor next-door could go nuts at one day, and start shooting everyone around without any rational reason, this is a thought that drives a lot of plot in The Crazies.The real horror is being completely disconnected from the rest of society, being a subject of a "containment protocol", that you don't even know details of, all that happening because of an plane crash that was on route to the destination, where its lethal payload would be incinerated, but never made it due to an accident (pilot error? equipment error? who cares?), is terrifying. Suddenly the people who were supposed to defend you from enemy, become your personal enemy, and you don't have any idea why, or what they will do to you next.It is the masterpiece of taking everything you thought you knew, you took for granted as known and friendly or at least predictable, and turning it into the unpredictable danger to your life and lives of the ones you care about.I love the music score. The subtle themes that immediately recall pictures from the movie when I accidentally recall the music. The score that you hear in scenes leading to really scary events, the sound effects (scratching of the pitchfork on the floor), it's undeniably great and never failing to cause goosebumps.Acting of 2 characters, David (the sheriff), and Russ (the deputy), deserve special mentioning. T.O. as the sheriff is awesome, I have not noticed many actors being able to convey the seriousness of situation by using their face muscles only. When T.O. has wrinkled forehead, everything is fine; when his forehead becomes flat, you know things are going to get very ugly, or close to ugly. Not many actors can do that, and T.O. is a better than good. He needs more movies to show his acting chops to be compared to my personal best of the best example of actors who only need mimics to set the mood - Jack Nicholson, who in Witches of Eastwick was absolutely brilliant, and no one, absolutely no one else, could play his role better. And of course, "The Shining", which I'm mentioning only to prove that I remember true classics. T.O. is getting there, but needs more movies, at least as ambitious as this one.J.A. as Russ is awesome too. The way he finishes Peggy and Curt, and handing the gun to the sheriff, saying "just making sure", is about to become a classic, or it already is (it's soooo much memorable than a line "come with me if you want to live", and I don't want to mention the title of the 3 movies in the same series, from which this immediately forgettable line comes from). His acting, delivering his lines, given script for his character, is top-notch. So much, he deserves an Academy award. I am not trying to glorify any of his character's personal qualities, just precision in creating a psychologically consistent character, including remaining a "good guy" until the end (though with some carefully planned occasional jumping into the "crazies" behavior).The 2 happy but deceitful songs enveloping the movie are increasing the contrast of the movie's plot and acting. And the tunes (like the one repeated over and over throughout the movie, and heard entirely when the credits are shown) are binding the unique musical score to the motion picture perfectly. Almost as much sense of horrifying mood is conveyed through the tunes as it is through the visuals.I like this movie a lot, and it's one that can be watched over and over, which in my book, sets it in a "great flicks" category in the "horror movies" chapter. I am scared every time while watching it, but because I know what is going to happen, I don't jump in my seat, and it's also avoiding unnecessary visual gore.Really good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing new but it's relentlessly brutal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original film by George "Everything Of The Dead" Romero, but I felt keen in watching this movie. I'm kind of glad I did. Although the script felt like many horror movie scripts torn out and all the good parts stapled together. Think "Cabin Fever" meets "The Hills Have Eyes" meets "Night Of The Living Dead" meets "The Mist" meets "Outbreak" and you get the idea.Having said that, this version is a well made and solid horror thriller nonetheless. It features believable performances from Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell, some really freaky scenes, a brooding atmosphere throughout, and a really great director, and you're strapped in for one hell of a ride.The level of violence in this movie is brutal enough that it's enough to make today's horror fans feel satisfied without the need of too much overblown gore, it's just good ol' fashioned horror movie-making, jump scares and all. In fact the screenwriters must've thought that the jump scare cliché was overused in many movies. So what do they do? Overuse this cliché in this movie. Seriously this film had the most number of jump scares I've seen in any horror movie and it is surprisingly and effectively well-handled and genuinely scary.Director Breck Eisner is set to have a cult following of his own. Repetitive as the script may be, Eisner makes full use of the meager $20 million budget and creates a somewhat visceral and solid B-movie, melded together with dark cinematography and an eerie score by Mark Isham, and you have 1 hour and 40 minutes of solid entertainment. And that's what I got.In short my low expectations were exceeded, and it was quite a ride. Breck Eisner better do John Carpenter proud with that "Escape From New York" remake!Overall value: A solid 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know its a zombie movie but come on. A military satellite that can locate a crashed plane but does nothing about it for weeks till someone discovers it? Why no we wont track this plane full of toxic chemicals or a virus or whatever and when it crashes in the middle of Iowa we'll leave it alone to contaminate the water till someone finds it then we'll roll in hot and wipe out the town... Horrible premise but the brilliant acting of Timothy Oliphant does give it some watch-ability.In the house scene where the sheriff and his wife get held hostage at gunpoint by 2 of the "crazies" I have to ask... in a silent house how do you not hear a wheezing zombie psychopath right behind you? Or for that matter several other places where there are "jump scares" like the military's first appearance ... sheriff's in his barn his wife yells from the house for him and he goes running out and there's 50 soldiers with trucks and flashing lights and a school bus and he doesn't hear that or see it coming up the extremely long path to his house on the way out to the barn 20 seconds earlier? Then later on the street after the rednecks take off with their truck he hears the military coming when its completely silent. So he has selective hearing?Then there's the burning of the bodies... if you are infecting people with a bioweapon that turns them crazy after drinking infected water and then you shoot them and burn the body how do you know that you wont make the virus become airborne and spread even faster? Its just not even close to believable to be honest. Maybe John Romero should go watch the movie outbreak again to see how to do a real containment and military oppression movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing worse than a bad movie is an uninteresting one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll write 2 paragraphs, the first will review this as a movie, the second one will review it as a zombie flick fan.As a movie: This movie started with quite an interesting premise, but it never developed. The storyline started... and that's pretty much it. After the initial 30 minutes, the rest of the movie were action and suspense scenes alternated almost mathematically(and they were not even that good or creative until the last one). Although i'm not against cliché, this movie overuses them up to the point were, if you have ever seen a zombie movie, played a zombie game or seen...well, ANY movie, you will know in 30 minutes what's gonna happen, who's gonna get killed and how it's going to end. The only thing that kept me going was HOW they were going to pull it off, and they didn't take any chances. Very uninteresting.As a zombie flick: OK, any zombie fan knows zombie movies are made just to see who can achieve the most creative, imaginative ways to kill hordes of humans that suffer from a disease/curse that prevents the audience from feeling any guilt about watching them get mutilated! ...Well, this movie wasn't very creative. As i said before, too many clichés were used, and particularly two of them were done over and over again each time the characters entered a place or got into a tight situation. The movie tells you very little about too many characters' lives, then pretends to make the audience feel involved with each of them. I don't know about you, but i don't get too involved with 10 minutes of someone's daily routine.All in all, this movie suffers from the "The Happening" effect: The premise is awesome, but we only get a couple of minutes of it swimming in an hour of pointless, uninteresting scenes with not even fun or awesome kills to keep you distracted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... There is a SCARY virus going around horror movie directors, basically turning them into brain-dead zombies. Symptoms include an inclination to blue tint everything, lack of original thinking and trying to emulate 28 Days Later. Mystery viruses have become a dull cliché within the genre and make a film predictable and unexciting. There is almost nothing notable or out of the ordinary here; this is a very forgettable film. The cinematography is fine and the plot itself is linear with little irregularity, but these things, these along with other familiarities that horror movie fans will recognise instantly, merely add to the overall dullness and conventionality of the film.

		<fullReview>Few remakes are as good as the original or even better especially if you're talking about horror movies.This is one of the movies that in my opinion is better than the original or at least at the same level. The plot is simple, the fact is that this movie is similar to 28 Days Later. A virus carried by a plane to be destroyed spreads through a little American town due to the plane crashing in a nearby river and infests all the people in the town. The action is handled very well and is I must say intense. The sound editing is great and I really liked the score to this movie just because it made it more epic. The cinematography is better than most of the similar movies today and it raises the bar of this movie.The acting is very good, Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell who is hot as always gave a sense to this movie as far as acting and character development. This is one of the movies that you can't find too many mistakes till it hits you with the end. In my order the end was a little bit forced with the big explosion and the truck doing like 80-90 mph and escapes in like less than 30 seconds which is ... *sigh* but at the end this was an entertaining movie and a real good remake of the first movie from 1973 and I must say better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another solid remake of a George Romero classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the past twenty years, there have been a number of remakes of George Romero films (and several unauthorized sequels as well). These remakes have so far ranged from absolutely horrible ('Night of the Living Dead 3D') to mediocre ('Night of the Living Dead' (1990)) to actually quite good ('Dawn of the Dead' (2004)). When news of a remake for 'The Crazies' was released, horror fans seemed divided. While the story itself is nothing overly original, Romero's use of it made for a solid second major horror film after 'Night of the Living Dead' (ignoring the typically forgotten 'Season of the Witch,' which is quite good as well).The story focuses on the small town of Ogden Marsh in Iowa that becomes the victim of both a violence-inducing virus and the murderous military officials attempting to put the virus down. The town's sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his wife (Radha Mitchell), and the deputy (Joe Anderson) escape from the clutches of the government in an attempt to fight their way out of town against all of those trying to kill them.Similar to Zack Snyder's take on Romero's zombie classic 'Dawn of the Dead,' Breck Eisner spins Romero's original of 'The Crazies' into a non-stop action-horror that starts strong from the second scene and very rarely lets up on the intensity. The pace is solid and is met with a style of directing that doesn't succumb to the typical flashy "MTV-style" that many horrors have been suffering from. The leads put forth good performances, especially Joe Anderson (who got a boost in stardom after 2007's 'Across the Universe'). The writing suffers from some lack of character development for secondary characters, but it still made for a group of lead characters worth caring for. While there are quite a few great jump scares, the film also does offer some very good suspense which something greatly lacking in many faster paced horrors (the pitchfork scene was tremendously nerve-wracking).Overall, the film meshes well in its action-horror style without neglecting quality film-making and real scares &amp; suspense.Final Verdict: 8/10.-AP3-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer for this on a DVD of mine and thinking how good it looked. Not like all the other zombie movies saturating horror, I thought. I couldn't have been more wrong.Lets not mince words, the plot is a pastiche of every other awful zombie movie of the past ten years. The post 9-11 sinister government plot wasn't subtle or threatening, and the number of deus ex machina escapes is simply ridiculous, even for brainless horror. The ending is predictable as, not surprisingly, is most of the film.There isn't any character development, or any attempt to avoid cliché. The direction is poor too, there being apparently no attempt even to inject any real cheap shocks to liven up proceedings.I would seriously advise anyone who has an hour and a half to watch the 1960's classic Dawn of the Dead instead. A thousand times scarier, smarter and more original than this generic, cliché-ridden bore-fest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ah, The Crazies...When the reviews were coming out mainly positive for this film, I thought it was bringing something entirely new to the zombie flick. Boy, was I wrong. I'm not going so far as to say the film was unwatchable, but honestly, if you think you want to see this movie and own any zombie movie, just watch that and save your ten bucks.With no sarcasm intended, this is basically a synopsis of the film: Plane crash with bad chemical, mixes with water supply, makes townsfolk crazy, government intervention, government fails, resorts to dropping enormous bomb on city to stop the spread of the sickness. I mean, could it be any more cliché? We all know that zombie/epidemic type movies basically follow the same formula, but the director or writer adds his own unique twist, making it stand on its own. But this film was literally just as I explained it, it went 1, 2, and 3. Movie over. At no point throughout the film did anything happen that you haven't seen before occur.Another minor complaint I had was the lack of gore. I am not a fan of the over the top Hostel and Saw violence, but this is the type of movie where you not only (this might be a personal preference) want to see some shocking scenes, but sort of expect it. I honestly believe if all of the cursing was taken out of the movie it would of wound up being PG-13. Again, it might be a personal preference but it was something I found disappointing and really brought the film down.Something that really saved this film from being a complete letdown was it's great performances by the main characters. Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell, and Joe Anderson are very good in this movie and really bring out emotion in their performances. They pull it off well and don't somehow become superheroes just because there is an epidemic. Mainly though, you care about them and want to see them get through it.Overall, I found The Crazies to be an extremely mediocre horror film that brought nothing new to the genre. I will, however, give the movie some credit for the great performances by the leads and, you know, I saw the movie on a Saturday afternoon for some entertainment, and let's face it, it would be really hard to see a movie like this and not be a little entertained. I just feel they could have done much more with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rarity: A remake that works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In my opinion, studios are too quick to rework something that's already been done, whether that's sequels, remakes, re-imagined screenplays, movies based on books, etc. Often the movie can't live up to its predecessor (Friday the 13th). Sometimes the writers will find something that works (Rob Zombie's Halloween (yes I actually liked it)), but still miss something. Rarely will the studio actually find a way to bring a remake new life. This is one of those times.In a (very) general overview, the movie follows a small group of townspeople trying to survive as an unknown plague spreads and the government tries to take control of the situation. The first few minutes of the movie follow Timothy Olyphant's character through the town of Ogden Marsh. Some light country music plays in the background. After a few minutes, the movie dives into the story, giving the audience only a small glimpse at the town and how it runs. My original thought was "Wow, no character development?" and my expectations dropped. How can we be expected to follow the story and sympathize with the characters? But what quickly became obvious to me is that the writers and the director wanted us to get to know the characters based on the situation they're presented with. This formula actually works, and very well. The audience can see who each person really is through the fear and how they take control of it.The movie progresses quickly, usually a bad move on the director's part, but here the progression keeps tensions high. No scene has a dull moment. The movie breaks away from the standard horror movie formula. There's no major mystery. There aren't any obviously dumb characters that you're just counting down to their deaths. It leaves that "how do we fix everything????" plot-line behind. There's only one goal for each character: survive. The characters are all likable, and you're rooting for them to make it, even if you can tell which ones are going to die and which are going to live. The acting is solid all around. "The Crazies" are creepy on a huge scale. I found them to be much scarier than Romero zombies (the classic slow walk), and only a bit less than The Infected of the 28 series (quick-moving, horrifying things).The only problems I have with the movie, which prevent a perfect 10 or a 9, are toward the end of the movie. Without revealing too much, I found the end a bit ridiculous, and the portrayal of the government was a bit too cliché. All-in-all, however, the movie was great. I found it very enjoyable. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The acting was great, the scares were effective, and in a time where studios are trying to make money solely off of questionable remakes, this is a welcome change of pace. It distances itself from the classic horror movie formula to keep the thrills, but also make for a realistic movie that lets the characters drive the storyline based on emotion and put the audience in their place. I recommend this movie to anyone looking for a good scare, strong plot, and great acting. You won't be disappointed by The Crazies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello, my name's Average.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of Romero's The Crazies. I haven't seen the first one yet, and for good reason; I've always heard it was one of Romero's weaker movies. Of course it will have its share of fans, but it's widely known as one of his skip-able entries. Funny thing is, after seeing this remake, it makes me want to see the original. And why? Because it has to be better than this.Story follows the town Sheriff, his loyal deputy, his loyal hot doctor wife and a couple of filler characters around as they escape from the crazies, and military containment crew that has come to nullify the situation. The situation at hand is your basic turn crazy and kill type of scenario, ya know, they're infected. This time around though, these infected people can think and talk?but that's not always the case for some reason. Some act braindead, and some act very aware of their bloodthirsty desires. But whatever about that. The Crazies is about escaping the two problems, but of course, confronting these two issues constantly throughout the duration of the movie.My biggest problem with this film is just how un-movie like the whole thing felt. There was a time when movies, to me, actually felt special. The acting, the writing and just the overall feel of it?felt like it was handled more professionally. But that's not the case nowadays as this, and almost every Hollywood horror flick coming out, feels like a FX special. Of course, what I'm saying here has been a recurring thought for years, but I will say I think Hollywood bullsh!t is getting stinkier. Bottom line, and what I'm trying to say is, the film was just very average. The acting, the writing (especially the emotional aspect), and the overall lackluster creativity of the film was just a damn wash. Timothy Oilyfart I hear is good in other things, but with horror?it takes more than a hushed voice and wide-eyes to pull a character along. Maybe I should blame the director or script here...but, with this type of flick, it doesn't matter who I put blame on.If you're really bored, and you don't really watch flicks other than to be entertained, have a ball with this one. But if you truly appreciate your horror flicks, and want to have a thrilling experience that delivers genuine emotion?then pass on this Hollywood remake, just like how you've passed on all the others. What's that? You appreciate horror? And you thought this movie rocked? Oh, well, uhh...what time is Dancing with the Stars on?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies - not my usual cup of tea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>but i liked it. i don't usually go to horror films but a premiere screening at the Vista was hard to resist. This film does not look cheap. The effects were good, the actors were believable, the thing kept moving. There's some graphic stuff, but it's a horror film and no real gross out factor. And it just kept coming, it was spare, not a lot of fat. It's not an original story and some things you know are going to reappear later, but because it kept moving, you didn't have time to dwell on the fact that they were coming back. It was kind of cool that when we walked up to the theater they made the marquee say "Ogden Marsh Cinemas".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Characters should be self-aware by now</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In most horror movies, there is an underlying code to it's creation that states characters must interact carelessly with their surroundings. They must be fearless, unaware of the context, even blatantly stupid. Nowadays movies parody this, with the black guy dying first no matter what and the girl trying thousand keys to ignite the engine before the killer grasps her. They laugh at themselves. "The Crazies" should.Seeing "The Crazies" reminded me of this. Even though the situation is abominably terrifying, they enter houses and check on places assuming it's safe. Rotating camera angles later reveal, to our surprise, they aren't. They walk the highway even if it is where they will most likely be seen. They reactions elicit the situations; and we all understand it would be boring otherwise; but when there is no fear in the characters it's hard to identify.Of course, every time they are in danger a miracle bullet saves the day at the last second. The characters die in the order one who has seen at least a movie of the genre would expect, and in the fashion you'd imagine. There is an everlasting seduction in seeing apocalyptic America, in the "what if" of the end of the world (or the town in this case), sure. But Breck Eisner could only go that far; considering the characters he received. They should start being more conscious by now, or at least blame screenwriters who keep on putting them on those spots.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Decent Remake Of The Work From Horror Maestro George A. Romero.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was pretty good, and in this day and age good enough you'd think it was an original. Considering the abundance of horror remakes in the past couple of years, the original "The Crazies" (1973) was a film that sadly never took off. It was from George A. Romero's filmography and even though it was super low budget, it was a pretty interesting look and take at the macabre of how people could turn on others so easily. And how warfare is essentially tested on each other in strange ways.But upon hearing of this being remade, I could not help but think "another one"? Don't get me wrong, but so many obviously flop. I had the same thought when they remade "Dawn Of The Dead" (2004), and although it wasn't spectacular, it had Zack Snyder's visual flair and did do a pretty solid job.Luckily for us. "The Crazies" manages to do a great job by using very good actors, as well as stacking the odds and isolation of the situation against them. Why horror is always failing recently is why would you care who died if you didn't get into the characters personalities? Obviously they are apparently nothing but bodies to be gouged and mutilated, and each new film tries to one-up each other. Which is why I say good on "The Crazies". It has characters that descend into madness, discover redemption, and strive through isolation that keeps a moderate pace throughout.Final Verdict: Pretty good pacing, and pretty good characters. 6.5/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crazies (2010) Another re-watch , I know I have seen more then once before, I don't think I saw it in full in my second watch, so I gave it another ago again! I have not see the original for a very long time, I didn't think was all that great, I do remember that I did enjoy the remake better on my first watch. However It took me while to get into movie, I was actually wasn't really paying to much attention for the first half. Again for this movie the second part of the movie kinds of moved a little bit more, I found some parts really good and fun to watch. One or two decent Crazies (No, I am not calling zombies, there not zombies)_kills not many gory ones, most of the times , they just being shot dead. I really liked some of the make up effects for the Crazies, some looked really good and scary! The one think I am little confused about was why did some Crazies actually look scary and some just look like normal people!The acting was decent from the whole cast! 6 out of 10, Again Not as Good as I remembered</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is a movie and plot that we've all seen before...been there, and done that. what takes this movie a couple of notches above is the fact that everything done in the movie including the acting, special effects, setting, cinematography...literally everything about this movie is done on a scale of 1-10, at least every sector scores an 8 or above. you know those fighting games with different meters for the fighter, where every bar is at the top or close to it, well...that is how the movie was. that is what made it so enjoyable.Tim Olyphant is like one of the most under-rated actors in America, he has got leading man looks and has serious acting chops. in this movie, he was very very good. talk about under-rated, so is Radha Mitchell and in this movie she is very very good also. the best acting award has to go to Joe Anderson who plays Russell the sheriffs deputy, he was excellent and i really felt for his character.the story is implausible, but...we need to put that aside and just enjoy the movie for what it is, a very good action horror movie. there is just the right amount of gore with no gratuities, so for you gore-hounds out there...you guys and gals will be a little disappointed, it is not explicitly gory. the action is non-stop after the first 10-15 minutes and there are some jump moments in this movie. another plus for this movie is that there is almost no dumb moments...at least not any that i can think of off-hand. the pacing was very very smooth and the tension never lets up after the action starts.very good pg-13 movie, as good as a re-hashed horror action flick can get. i highly recommend for a good time!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid remake!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, we've had our fair share of remakes the last few years. Horrormovies such as Friday the 13th, My Bloody Valentine and Halloween have all met their modern version. As watchable as they all may be, I couldn't help but notice the amount of graphic violence, nudity and profanity in these remakes. Don't get me wrong, I'm don't mind these elements at all, but they should be used in a fitting way.The Crazies is a fine example of reaching a new generation without having to win the audience over with big boobs, tough guy talk en splattering brains. Sure, there is still enough gore in this movie, but it is the intensity and suspense that do it in this movie. Despite an easy going story building, this movie hits off immediately with the "baseballgame scene". Right after that, you know that something is terribly wrong in Ogden Marsh and that it's just silence before the storm.I'm a big fan of quarantine situations (in movies), like in Outbreak. The government is willing to use all means necessary to stop a virus from spreading. That in combination with the civilians who go on a rampage. Cought in the middle are a few healthy people who will do everything to survive. Timothy Oliphant, Radha Mitchell and Danielle Panabaker do a good job in this movie in portraying your everyday individual who doesn't understand was has happened and is just trying to live the normal life. So: good enough acting, some nice gore, excellent setting (boring town in the middle of nowhere) and best of all, enough attention to detail and story building. A solid horror movie remake for those who want to see something else then the dime a dozen slashers.Particularly fun if you live in a rural area with a lot of farms and wooden houses ;)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Immediate full disclosure: I have not seen the 1973 version, considered, I understand, to be something of a cult classic. But this remake, co-written and exec. produced by the originals' director, and zombie supremo, George A. Romero, is a bland and lacklustre b-movie which is unlikely to be remembered by anyone for long.In one of those friendly neighbourhood mid-west hicksville towns, locals start acting all strange and a bit zombie-like. Some people mutter something about mysterious military activity, good sheriff Timothy Olyphant does a fine Clint Eastwood pose on a deserted main street, and the local dodgy mayor gives a speech about water supplies that simply exchanges "Ogden Marsh" for "Amity" and "crops" for "summer dollars".At best, a just barely competent, run-of-the-mill chiller, The Crazies is wholly underwhelming. Clichéd, derivative, dumb, and most damningly, NOT even slightly scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An overrated remake to an underrated original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story Synopsis: During a school baseball game in the small Iowa town of Ogden Marsh, a farmer carrying a shotgun strolls into the field. Sheriff David Dutten is forced to shoot him when he refuses to drop the weapon. The next night another man sets his house on fire with his wife &amp; son trapped inside. Investigating these tragic instances of bizarre behaviour, Dutten &amp; his deputy discover that a government military plane carrying "Trixie", a form of biological weaponry had crashed in the nearby creek, contaminating the town's water supply. Soon after their discovery, the entire town is sealed off by the military. They round everyone up &amp; subject them to tests. Dutten's wife, Judy, who is also the town's doctor, is mistakenly presumed to be infected &amp; is kept inside a makeshift clean room in the local high school. Dutten manages to slip past the military &amp; rescues Judy, along with her assistant who is also detained. Along with Dutten's deputy Russell Clank (whose behaviour is starting to become questionable), they attempt to flee the town. But their plans to flee Ogden Marsh become increasingly unlikely as the military resort to heavy-handed tactics in order to contain the outbreak.Film Analysis: The original THE CRAZIES was the fourth film of legendary genre director George A. Romero, forever known as the man who modernised the zombie with his apocalyptic classics NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, DAWN OF THE DEAD, DAY OF THE DEAD &amp; further sequels; as well as making some other classic genre films such as CREEPSHOW, the Stephen King adaptation THE DARK HALF &amp; MONKEY SHINES. The Crazies is perhaps the most underrated of Romero's classics, to this day being given a mixed response by most genre critics. Many consider the film to be one of Romero's lesser films while many others (including me) consider The Crazies to be an excellent film that should have become more of a success than what it ultimately got. Regardless of where you stand, the fact is that the film is an undoubtedly effective look at the consequences of making biological weaponry.During the 2000s, the genre was going through a fad of revisiting its past by remaking virtually all of the classic (&amp; not-so-classic) 70s &amp; 80s genre flicks that had made headlines during those decades. The Crazies was inevitably picked for the remake approach. With the likes of having scribe Scott Kosar (who had already started the remake craze off by writing the script for the remake of THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE) &amp; largely unproven director Breck Eisner at the helm, the film performed admirably at the box office &amp; even got some positive reviews.I wanted to like this remake of The Crazies. I really did, since the concept would have made a good film these days. But the problem was that I found this remake to be slick but ultimately soulless. Part of the problem is that Kosar's script, while flashy, forgot the basics of what the original was about. Romero's original was about a small-scale apocalypse with the military proving to be incapable of handling the outbreak of madness caused by one of their own bioweapons. Here the military not only manages to seal off the town but ruthlessly wipes out almost the entire town by shooting innocent people in cold blood &amp; covering their tracks by nuking the town. Not just that but the military here is literally faceless, with POV shots from their spy satellites &amp; the soldiers never taking their gas masks off, except for one person.Not just that, but the outbreak of madness that ultimately consumes the town is not as well defined as it was in the original. The idea of a town of people becoming increasingly unpredictable, even homicidal is in some ways more terrifying than a town full of zombies but this remake fails to get the point. There is almost nothing in the way of true suspense, only an emphasis on gory deaths. There is nothing here that would even get within a kilometre of disturbing the viewer the way that the original film did.The characters here are a decidedly mixed bunch. Some, like the military, are one-dimensional while others are only fleshed out by the skill of the actors themselves. Timothy Olyphant does a decent job of playing the heroic sheriff while Aussie actress Radha Mitchell is stuck with a role that doesn't suit her immense skill (in saying that I mean that she is given almost nothing to do here despite her talent in playing ballsy chicks in films such as PITCH BLACK).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Besides the fact that I could watch Timothy O. just stand there for two hours and read the phone book aloud, I thought this was a very good movie. It moved along a good pace, the scary parts were scary, and it had a good balance between blood and guts and true tension (would the bad guy get Judy when she was hiding in the pile of dead people?) This is not the type of movie I usually watch, but I was pleasantly surprised at how creepy and spooky it was. I am not familiar with the original movie at all, but I might be tempted to look at some older George Romero movies. I know that the fad now is for zombie movies and I have "enjoyed" THE WALKING DEAD episodes that I have seen, because like this movie, the TV series seems to have a PLOT rather than just spend an hour killing people in the most bloody way that the directors can. I could also see a lot of Raylan Givens in the character that TO played in this movie and since that is a real favorite of mine, it added to the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Welcome to Ogden Marsh!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, rarely is a remake better than the original! The 2010 remake of George Romero's THE CRAZIES takes the same basic concept from the original and then runs with it in a number of different directions. All of them brilliant! In Ogden Marsh, Iowa, it's a beautiful day, baseball season has started, and David the sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) has just settled in to watch the game when the town drunk appears carrying a shotgun. When David goes out to confront him, the man raises his gun, so David is forced to shoot him. Meanwhile, David's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell) is the local doctor. A concerned wife brings in her husband William who's "not right." Finding nothing physically wrong with him, she sends them home. Early the next morning, David is called to investigate a fire. Arriving there, he finds William sitting in front of his burning house, out of his mind and whistling like nothing has happened. Investigating further, David and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson) discover a plane has crashed into their lake, which is where the town gets their water supply. Slowly, they realize they're being cut off: no internet, no phones, no TV. Before too long, the townsfolk are being corralled into buses by soldiers and quarantined. David however, along with several others, manage to break free to see if they can make it out of town on their own. The rest I'll leave for you to discover. Like I said earlier, rarely is a remake better than the original, but this one is just that and scary as hell!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is pretty good! and it impressed me!.i liked all of the characters i found them all very like-able so as a result i cared about them and i wanted their characters to live,and that's because they were characters that were written well!,they were characters that actually had personality and that's important with people in a movie you need good characters and this film pulled it off great! in my opinion. As i'm sure allot of people know this is a film about people who become infected by insanity,as the cover of my DVD case says (Insanity is infectious). (That's only in this film obviously) but i quite liked the idea and i like the director of this film and i liked all of the actors,my favourite three being Timothy Olyphant,Radha Mitchel and Danielle Panabaker. I thought the acting was good from everyone especially those three and i thought they all played their rolls well and i also thought Joe Anderson gave a good performance and i liked his roll as Deputy Russell Clank and i liked that he was friends with Timothy's Character i thought they were good friends and it was fun seeing them together in this film,i liked their friendship and i thought both the guys were very cool Characters and its characters like theirs that need to be written more in other films. I thought this was a very fun and intense film and i thought the film had a dark Atmosphere to it and i found it a little creepy at times,there were some scenes that were bloody and made you want to look away! but that's what makes this film so good,the intensity of it! and the acting and the story and the good writing and the like-able characters.i just Loved the idea of everyone in town turning crazy! that was a cool idea for a film,and i liked how more and more people turned crazy and then it builds up and gets worse and worse! until nearly everyone is infected. This film is similar to (28 days later and 28 weeks later) because people are becoming infected only in the other films the people became zombies and in this film everyone turns crazy and starts doing dangerous things. I also thought the film had some good mystery behind it and i liked the way the film made us guess as to what was going on at the Beginning,its usually fun to try and figure things out in a film and i liked that about this film. The whole film especially the bits at the end were very intense! and it got my heart pumping as i watched it because so many things were happening! and the film was really entertaining and because i liked the characters i wanted them all to survive! and escape,especially Timothy and his wife,i thought they were a good couple in the film and they had some cool moments in the film and i liked the scenes when the two of them were on the run from the crazy people. The original 1973 crazies was a good film but i have to say i liked the remake even more!.I found this film to be more intense than the first film and a little faster moving too,those being the only differences between the films.the first film i liked But this Remake was very impressive! and i thought the directer did a fantastic Job directing this Movie!.And for anyone out there that hasn't seen this movie i advise you to watch it! its a very memorable film and you won't be disappointed!.This film deserves a solid 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has potential, but turns out bland</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let's face it, George Romero's '70s toxic-infection movie THE CRAZIES isn't one of his best movies. In fact it's an instantly forgettable piece that holds nothing like the same kind of power as his living dead trilogy. A good choice, then, for a remake, with the chance to improve on the flaws.Except THE CRAZIES remake is no improvement. It is an equally forgettable movie, one which seems to possess no originality or unique features of its own. The story, about townsfolk becoming infected by some pollution, is predictable and the film that plays out is entirely familiar. Although the infected aren't technically zombies, this might as well be a zombie movie for all the difference it makes.The faults definitely lie with the script, which took about three guys to write (always a bad sign). The production values are decent, and the film bags a great leading actor in Timothy Olyphant (much better in his everyman role here than in the ludicrous Hit-man). A shame that so much is so overly familiar, then. Radha Mitchell's whiny, screaming wife fares particularly badly - why are we still getting female roles like this in modern cinema? And that ending - really? Overall, the movie isn't particularly bad, and if you've never seen a film like this before then you'll probably be shocked, surprised and caught up in a genuinely exciting thriller. If, like me, you've seen it all before, you'll probably sit back at the end and wish for Hollywood movies that contain interesting characters for a change, not the routine hero/villain types played out here. How about making the main character a coward who abandons his family and colleagues in fear? I'd pay to see that...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hi. Can I Borrow a Cup of Sugar? Or, Perhaps, Your Brain?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder how many movies have been made about a rogue biological agent running amok in a small mid-western town.Okay, so maybe they haven't all been centered in small mid-western towns, but the premise is all too familiar: some sort of unknown virus is causing people to turn into blood-thirsty maniacs, and a higher power (typically an unnamed government agency) is sent in to contain the threat for the greater good. The Crazies is the most recent in the aforementioned long line of zombie-fueled horror flicks that Hollywood (and television) seems to love. Whether it's 28 Days Later, Zombieland, The Survival of the Dead, The Walking Dead, etc., the sub-genre has shown absolutely no signs of slowing down.If you can ignore the decidedly cliché premise, The Crazies is able to muster a break-neck pace that's only sporadically hampered by routine scares. It's a bare-bones?albeit effective?exercise in raw fear, and there's something to be said for that.Like 2008&#x2032;s Quarantine, the audience is forced to tag-along with a single protagonist who's just as clueless (as I've said in many-a- review, that's a relative term) as we are. Through the grisly details surrounding several of Ogden Marsh's residents' decent into lunacy do we learn what's really going on, and, as one could likely infer, there's only one logical conclusion that come from the events in question. As a viewer, then, it seems that we should be most worried about execution (pun intended) and competency. Questions like, "Does the film really scare me? Is it inventive? Do I feel like I'm not being insulted?" should serve as a compass when judging movies such as this.In this case, the answer is a sturdy "yes" all the way around. Though there are some traditional horror movie "jump" scares, there's the sense that any character could bite the big one at any second. That, of course, makes for a fairly unnerving viewing experience, and the sheer madness of the infected townspeople's actions' makes us dread just how twisted the next death scene is going to be. Thankfully, director Breck Eisner is apparently aware of the fact that his audience has run the gamut of "outbreak horror" films, and he strips the story and direction down to the bare essentials (because, after all, we know all too well what's lurking just around the next corner, both literally and in terms of narrative).Because of its brisk pacing and no-nonsense treatment of what some might call an overused formula, The Crazies, for the most part, ends up being a refreshingly honest horror entry where many others would likely fail while navigating the same territory.</fullReview>

So is there anything left to offer to the zombie-type horror movie? Well yes, but not a huge amount. Remaking movies that you've not heard of is probably better than a dodgy remake of a classic, but there's only glimmers of new ideas here ? some of the best moments have not only been used in other recent movies, but sometimes get a repeat airing within the running time of this movie.Most of the characters are cyphers, but you're still left occasionally guessing as to who will make it out alive. Sadly, some gaping holes in the logic undermine what momentum the movie has built up, and by the end some occasionally effective moments are all that linger, rather than the film itself.Why see it at the cinema: Horror films are always better when they get the benefit of the collective shock experience, and this is no exception.The Score: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crazies is one of the better remakes and for some good reasons. The action is intense, the acting is better than what i expected, The story has had a massive change which is actually for the better, and the scenes are really intense.I was expecting this to be a remake that was half decent but it more than decent. I don't think this is better than the remakes Dawn of the Dead, TCM, Cape Fear or the Hills Have Eyes but I still like it a lot.I like Romero's Crazies but i felt this Remake was a bit more stronger and also the people who get infected are more watchable in action because of the make up effects. When I watched Romero's version I felt it good but he rushed his in my opinion, while as with this Remake it slows things down and it keeps the action contained. I also really glad that it ain't bloody or gory.You should check this and Romero's version out though i reckon the Remake here is better. Not very often have I said Remakes are better than originals and this is the third remake to overcome it's original.</fullReview>

It's very slow, and when the action begins, it dries up fast. Honestly, I thought there would be a lot more happening in a 'Apocalypse' type movie.

		<fullReview>On its own as a horror thriller thing, this movie has appropriate atmosphere to be compelling enough to watch. But as it moves further and further along, it becomes rather clear that the whole reasoning behind why the events in the plot happened, as well as the responses of people involved, are directly the result of stupidity.Unlike the sort of "on the fly" stupidity in movies like "House of Wax" (2005) where you could possibly justify their stupidity in that they were in the heat of the moment, the biggest bouts of stupidity come from situations that had more than enough time for forethought longer than six minutes planning.For example: the plane. For the sake of avoiding spoiler (though it's not even that important a spoiler), I'll just say that a very important military airplane crashes in a location... and they don't even reach the area until some two or three days later. It's a tenuous stretch, but it causes even more stupid decisions...Like, the military suddenly swarming into town, busting into houses Iraq-style, and arresting EVERYONE and taking them to detention camps where parents are separated from children, and people are scanned. People asking questions are told to shut up, and are occasionally beaten up with assault rifle butts.Considering that they RELEASE the people they scan that are clean, it was completely not surprising that a bunch of rednecks in a truck SMASH into the compound, SMASH APART the ULTRA military defensive chainlink fence, and get slaughtered in the firefight... while also letting out ALL the people taken in the camp, infected and not infected.So because the military didn't bother setting up patrols, or defensive borders, or even TELLING people WHY they are being rounded up like criminals or terrorists, even with a token lie in order to prevent panic, their entire endeavor collapses and tons of people have to die.And EVEN WORSE than that, the thing they were scanning people for to tell if they were infected... elevated temperature.And given that a pregnant woman in average health was detected for elevated temperature, I think it'd be safe to say this would be like testing people by spraying them in the face with dust and considering anyone who sneezes to be infected. They don't even bother to realize that MAYBE she has high temperature because she's pregnant or sick or both or has a mild fever or maybe THEY'RE JUST A LITTLE HOT FROM BEING AMBUSHED LIKE CRIMINALS, RIPPED OUT OF THEIR HOMES, AND PUT IN A CAMP WITH A THOUSAND OTHER PEOPLE IN CLOSE QUARTERS.So because of that level of sheer stupidity, along with their handling of people like terrorists, it's supposed to be a SHOCK when the people react violently, and then the infected escape and spread and they have to nuke the town. Yes really. They nuke the whole town. Because they were too damn stupid to put more than six minutes of thought into a containment plan that would NOT cause wild panic and terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Drink the Water</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies is about a town with toxic chemicals in the drinking water. Of course any person who drinks the water will get the "crazies" within 48 hours. I don't want to give too much away. I will say this, I expected more out of a zombie-like movie. There was not enough horror in my opinion. I would have liked it to have been more along the lines of "The Hills have Eyes" with its shock horror. It fell mighty short for this viewer. It wasn't a total waste. There was action. It didn't have me looking to shut it off, but it just didn't do it for me. I decided to check on the 1970's original and it seemed to have even less horror. If you want more of the Zombie Killers fighting the uninfected then watch something else because this is more about Big Brother eliminating a problem.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was barely OK. Many movies have been made about a virus that kills people or turns them into zombies. Here the virus turns the towns folk crazy, and they start randomly killing people. The movie starts out good with a scene on the baseball field. A man walks onto the field with a gun. The sheriff, David, tells him to drop the gun and assumes he's drunk. The man never says anything but David is forced to shoot when he won't drop the gun. Later that night, he's called to a house fire where a fan locked his family in a closet and set the house on fire. Soon, the town is evacuated by the military; people with fevers are separated. David's wife, Judy, is separated from him. He is taking to a truck stop on the outskirts of town and he elects to go back into town to rescue her. This is where there is a huge plot hole. A man tells David that there are roadblocks set up and anyone trying to go through is shot. The next scene, David is at the sheriff's office. How did he get there and all of a sudden his deputy shows up.Next scene his wife is tied down at the high school fixing to get it from a crazy and just in time, David shows up to save her. How did he get there when he had no vehicle. I did not like that plot hole.So, the rest of the film is them trying to survive and escaping and killing some crazies along the way.FINAL VERDICT: If you like cheesy horror films, then check it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crazies" is an above-average horror/thriller/the government-is-out-to-get-us film distinguished by more subtle touches than many other contemporary slasher/gore films masquerading as horror movies. Yes, there are some clichéd moments here and countless plot holes (why would anyone leave his weapon-less pregnant wife alone in an abandoned truck stop that might be?okay, probably is?hiding crazed zombie-ish folks as he goes to gather supplies?), but Timothy Olyphant is quite good in the lead role (full disclosure?I have a huge crush on him, and I'd probably enjoy watching him do his laundry). The scares are well-earned, and if you're looking for a good old-fashioned creep-you-out kinda film, you could do a lot worse than this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A worthy classic redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wonderful little horror entry shows that a good script and great film making can trump originality. While Romero still gets kudos for creating the era, films such as this are still able to drive it forward. Of course, the solid cast added tremendously to its success, with Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchel deserving the top billing. Their chemistry takes away any guilt when our prayers are answered by predictable outcomes. The supporting cast was solid as well, with a surprising performance by Danielle Panabaker and with Joe Anderson deservingly threatening to steal the Show. The direction was more than competent, and the camera work took full advantage of the vast landscape in contrast to some of the more claustrophobic scenes. Overall this was one of those rare remakes that outshone its predecessor. Merci beaucoup.Evil Eye Reviews</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not a bad flick...especially for a horror film. Of course there are a few silly parts; as there is in any horror film. Great performance by Timothy Olyphant, whom I admire as an actor in Deadwood. This movie strongly resembles a similar plot displayed in "28 Days Later". Although I enjoyed 28 Days Later a bit more, this movie was well constructed (for a horror film). I must compliment Rahda Mitchell for a nice performance. I've never been a big fan however I have only good things to report of her performance in this movie. I actually anticipated a lesser movie and was pleasantly surprised by this film. I might just have to see what other films Mr. Eisner has directed and go from there. A little more explanation on the source of the illness and a few other critical items, I could only discuss with the Producer/Director, would have improved this movie from a 6, to maybe a 7 or even an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meh...it was okay. Plot had good potential, characters were awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly, I expected much more.I rented this movie because the commercials made it look nothing short of epic. I was impressed by the pretty visuals in the commercial, and so, I rented it.It was okay. The plot had a whole lot of potential to it -- I mean, infection plots aren't exactly OH WOW NEW AND EXCITING, but I still have a soft spot for them. I liked the thing with the plane, and how it was the water and not just some random virus that popped out of no where. And the crazies -- they were cool. They were creepy, and believable as people who would kill you as soon as they got the chance. I dig that.But on the other hand, the characters were absolutely dreadful. None of them seemed to have very distinct personalities, like...at all. As a person who obsesses over character design, I was extremely let down by this portion of the movie. The characters were flat and boring, and I had only a small ounce of care for what happened to them.The female lead was constantly running the whole 'damsel in distress' thing. It got to be annoying and predictable, because you knew she would live. I mean, of course, main characters will live, I won't deny that -- but it was extremely obvious. After separating from her husband while he runs some errands, she wanders off, almost gets killed, survives. It was the same thing every time she got into trouble.I applaud, however, the suspense. Some of the scenes were very well-down in terms of suspense, particularly in the beginning. However, overall, I was disappointed. I thought it could have been so much better, the plot could have been easier to follow (I for one got lost a couple of times), but again, it had potential.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies works, but just barely...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small town in Iowa gets infected with a toxin that makes people crazy enough to kill each other. Town sheriff and wifey try to survive.I really wanted to like 'The Crazies' a bit more. I like zombie/infected movies in general, even the cheesy ones, and of course Romero's ones, including the 1973 The Crazies, which this is a remake of. But The Crazies is in a long line of these types of movies that are popping up way too much, such as The Happening. Replace the nature part with government/scientist/terrorist group, etc., and you pretty much have filled about 5-10 years worth of these types of movies with little variety. (28 Days Later remains one of my 'recent' favorites) Sure, it had it's share of good parts, such as some folks strapped to gurneys while an infected walks around with a pitchfork. It's well produced, and director Breck Eisner seems to hold it together well, amid the small amount of movies he's made. Timothy Olyphant was good as the sheriff, but someone needs to beat him with an 'old' stick until he looks his age. But I guess I was looking for a bit more of this survival horror movie, maybe a better ending? I was a little disappointed with the cheese at the end, considering the movie takes itself seriously.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not too bad. The producers of the movie had an agenda in mind. They wanted to show that bad things can happen to peaceful middle class towns in fly over country, just as they happen to the liberal sinkholes on either coast. Of course this is manure, the reason the peaceful little towns in fly over country are peaceful is because the people work to keep them that way. Basically, the military attacks a peaceful town in Iowa because there is something in the water that makes people crazy. Why it just does not kill them is never explained. After that it just turns into the basic run, chase, kill we have all seen before. But the producers made sure to put in plenty of small town touches, like a baseball game, etc, so you would know that the tranquil life of middle America is not really so tranquil. But all of us here in fly over country know better. We will take our small town life, and you can keep all the crazies on either coast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"We're mad as hell, and we're not going to take this anymore!" - Howard Beale ("Network")This is a review of George Romero's "The Crazies", a horror film released in 1973, and 2010's "The Crazies", a remake directed by Breck Eisner, son of media mogul Michael Eisner.The better of the two, Romero's film sees the US military accidentally releasing a biological weapon into a small town's water supply. This bio-agent turns the town's population into raving, murderous lunatics. As a result, the US government swiftly quarantines the town. Much violence ensues.Romero's film is shapeless, overlong, lacking in tension towards its final act and nowhere as good as his zombie movies. It's also frequently brilliant. It's a mad, hilariously anarchic, politically incorrect mob of a movie, filled with manic energy and many strange passages, some of which were deemed shocking back in the early 1970s. Kubrick's "Dr Strangelove" - Romero borrows Kubrick's all-percussion soundtrack ? and Peter Watkins' "Punishment Park" seem to be the chief influences.Like Romero's zombie movies, "The Crazies" simmers with post-Watergate distrust. Our heroes are government hating Vietnam vets, and much of the film observes as various social institutions (the state, the nuclear family, the church) fester, implode or explode. Significantly, Romero paints contemporary society as being "crazy" long before the bio-agent was released; it was already waiting to discharge. The contaminated water merely shatters civilization's last facades and brings various latent abominations and/or unspoken feelings rushing to the surface. It was always going to happen. Or, as Romero says in interviews, "what's crazy is that it hasn't already occurred."Unsurprisingly, themes of incest and militarism abound. A father has sex with his daughter, priests set themselves on fire (echoing the famous self-immolation photographs of the Vietnam war, in which Buddhist monks set themselves alight), soldiers tear down villages like the Nazis' liquidated ghettos, helicopters echo Vietnam's Hueys, and much of the film paints military and government figureheads as being as mad and irrational as the infected townspeople. Pretty soon it becomes clear that the state's method of treating the madness is itself madness, Romero eradicating the line between infected and the uninfected; they're all crazy, the government mimicking the volatile, violent behavioural patterns of those contaminated. "You can't just push people around like this!" one man yells. But no one listens. Everyone's being pushed.The film's pacing is slowed by various sequences which focus on annoying bureaucrats and fast-talking figureheads. Though grating, Romero's intentions with these scenes are nevertheless correct. State bureaucracy, in which men and women spend as much time fighting each other, red tape and the inefficiency of procedure, is itself virus-like and counter-intuitive; nothing gets done, everyone infected with a kind of bureaucratic madness. Elsewhere scenes show rural idylls and totems of conservative America torn apart by mad patriarchs (the film's opening sequence is "Night of the Living Dead" in microcosm). Hilariously, few people are even given a chance to succumb to the virus; the military kills them more efficiently and rapidly than the virus ever could. One of the film's jokes is that a perfectly functioning military apparatus is far more illogical, bloated and morally messed up than the collapsed, lawless hordes it battles.Fittingly, the name of the film's bio-agent is Trixie, literally "the bringer of joy". On an allegorical level, it is the state's blunders, its inherent violence, which are directly inspiring an almost carnivalesque explosion of public mayhem. The military steps in to violently clamp down on these outbursts, but they're not fast enough. Oppositional groups clash, lock horns and slaughter one another in a mad, incoherent festival which does nothing but destroy any form of potential socio-political progress. An early 70s capitalist order is assaulted, but rather than enabling progressivism in the formation of a new social order, things are only further debilitated and any rational functions necessary for future formations are swiftly put down. The film ends with a pregnant woman dying (and with her the hope of a future), and two rugged men stepping out of the conflict's wreckage. One's an African American, airlifted above the carnage (symbolically outside and above it all), another's a fireman who embodies the adjusted (immunized) man of tomorrow: cynical and a Vietnam vet, but with a traditional love for marriage, servitude and stability (his first lines stress his love for "moderation"). The lyrics "Heaven Help Us" play over the film's closing credits. There are countless parallels between "The Crazies" and Romero's earlier and later films. Two obscure ones: Richard France, who looks like a cross between Orson Welles and Francis Ford Coppola, plays "men of reason" in both "The Crazies" and "Dawn of the Dead". His character's always warning populaces (Richard's an Orson Welles scholar, his character having many overlaps with Welles' "War of the Worlds" radio-play). Then there's "The Crazies'" plot itself, which echoes Romero's earlier "Season of the Witch", in which the banalities of the bourgeois drive an oppressed housewife's to various subversions and perversions. Released in 2010, Breck Eisner's "The Crazies" removes the politics of Romero's film but largely tells the same tale. It's a safe, clean and sanitised movie; like licking an Ipod while rubbing a credit card on your crotch. Glossy, overproduced, expensive looking and immaculately pressed, the film moves, looks and feels like plastic. While some of its horror moments elicit some thrills, it's mostly all very conventional and clichéd. Still, some of Eisner's changes are interesting. While Romero has officials talking of dropping a nuke on the infected town, Eisner does it for real (encapsulating the film's philosophy: spectacle over politics). Elsewhere he spares the life of a government soldier (who helps our band of rebels), whilst the far more pessimistic Romero outright murders the very same character. 6/10 - See 2009's "Carriers", 2011's "Contagion" and 1978's "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Updated version of the 1973 George A. Romero zombie epic of the same name "The Crazies" has to do with an entire community in rural Iowa being infected with this biological agent or weapon of mass destruction-WMD-that somehow got into the drinking water, by a US Army cargo plane crashing into the nearby reservoir,of Ogden Marsh. Soon a number of residents in town start to act odd and crazy like to the point where one of them Rory Hamill, Mike Hickman, had to be shot and killed by the town sheriff David Dutton,Tim Olyphant. That's when the zombie-like Rory not only refused put his loaded shotgun down during a baseball game but was ready to pull the trigger on the sheriff! Wih a number of other people in town getting infected by the water supply and one of them setting his house on fire killing his entire family it became evident that things were quickly spinning out of control. And it's then where almost out of nowhere dozens of trucks and armored vehicles from a nearby US Army military base came rolling into town. Not to save the town's residents but quarantine them and after determining that their infected by he chemical agent shoot and later have them cremated and leave no trace of them to be found!The movie has Sheriff Dutton together with his pregnant wife Judy, Radha Mitchell, Deputy Sheriff Russell Clank,Russell Clark, and teenage Becca Darling, Danielle Panabaker,take off in the corn and white fields of Iowa trying to escape the US Military who are out to off them as well as the hundreds of local out of control, running around in the countryside, zombies crazed by the chemicals that they ingested and thus becoming cannibalistic and thirsting for blood.Surviving a number of close calls with both the US Army attack,or black,helicopters as well as flesh eating zombies the trio, by then both Becca &amp; Deputy Sheriff Clank were out of the running as well as the movie, both Sheriff Dutton and his wife Judy get to this deserted truck stop outside of Ogdan Marsh town limits. It's there where the two are attacked by a gang of zombie truckers who end up getting done in,one well doe b set on fire and burned to a crisps, by the brave and frisky surviving couple. Catching the news on a truck radio of a secret coded US Army news bulletin that the town of Ogden Marsh and it's surroundings are due to be nuked by the US Army to put an end and cremate all the infected people, alive or dead, in it David Dutton and Judy take off on a truck trying to get as far as they can away to the safety of Ceder Rapids, some 50 miles away, from the soon to be detonated atomic blast!***SPOILERS*** What's the best part of the film "The Crazies" is that it didn't have the cop-out or happy ending as you would have expected it to have. As depressing as the ending was it brought a sense of both reality and believability into the movie. There was also the scene earlier in the film where both Sheriff Dutton and his somewhat reluctant deputy Clank shut off the water supply to the town against the mayor's orders. Something that you also wouldn't have expected them to do with their jobs hanging on the line if they did it! It showed that both Dutton &amp; Clank knew the seriousness of the situation and thus acted accordingly despite the consequences they were to face in doing what they,which turned out to be the right thing, did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy like a pox.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1973 George A. Romero movie of the same name, THE CRAZIES is a simple, shallow, well-made thriller. A virus drives the people of a bucolic Midwestern town crazy and they start killing people. I don't mean to nitpick, but killing is kinda natural for a species that kills to eat, to mate, to survive. You know what would really be crazy? A virus that made you paint your house.I can't compare the two versions, not having seen the Romero film, though in reading about it, we can discern how Romero's ham-fisted, no-budget execution subsumed his sociological commentary. The Romero version shows the military as becoming a bigger problem than the virus problem they were sent to solve; as reviewer Michael Atkinson puts it: "The Ashcroftian governmental cure out-terrorizes the disease." Yet that version is hobbled by its usual Romero non-acting. Again, I cannot speak with authority, so check it if you have two hours of life to throw away.Me? One THE CRAZIES is more than enough derangement.This 2010 version has the same military plane going down, releasing its cargo of deadly bio-weapon virus, but after the fervor that has grown up around America's deadliest, most useless arm of government, the military who arrive to clean up their mess here do not exacerbate the problem but are merely callous authorities that Our Heroes must escape. Bedecked in ominous gasmasks and hazmat suits to terrorize civilians just right.Timothy Olyphant is David, the Sheriff of this town where, like CHEERS, everybody knows your name; the man he must shoot in the film's first minutes (for going, uh, crazy), he addresses by his first name. His doctor wife is Judy (Radha Mitchell), Danielle Panabaker is Judy's intern, and Joe Anderson is Russell the deputy, a likable, dependable redneck (how many times can anyone say that?). These four are unaffected by the virus and escape the town and the military who are trying to kill or quarantine them.Olyphant seems like he'd be a cool guy to hang with. Even in ROCK STAR, he out-smoothed Marky Mark. Call me, Tim: few beers, some pool, bird-dogging chicks. Boys' night. One month after this role as a jeans-wearing small town sheriff quick on the draw, his TV series JUSTIFIED would premiere, where he plays a jeans-wearing small town sheriff quick on the draw. Born to do it. That guy's so cool...The film's one touching moment is when Russell realizes he is affected by the virus. Instead of being left to die in the wilderness, or killed immediately, he asks David and Judy, "Can I walk with you guys awhile?" That's so sad. His performance at that moment captures that human need for others of our kind, the universal truth of fearing to die alone. For a species grown so inured to killing, that vestigial aspect of our nature is our great irony.THE CRAZIES is the usual romp of jump-scares and gross-out killings and people with makeup that looks like a KFC factory exploded on their faces senselessly trying to kill other people (kinda like zombies; thanks, Romero - what an "original" idea!) and everyone saying "fuck" whenever they want, garnering an R-rating. Now remember kids, excessive gore alone can still warrant a PG-rating. THE CRAZIES is rated R because of its swearing. In other words, the gory mashings of skulls or the pitchfork through the torsos, or the knife through the sheriff's hand which he succeeds in slamming through the throat of his assailant while it is still through his hand, do not by themselves garner an R-rating; it's because the filmmakers chose to retain their frequent use of a word which is a euphemism for the act of procreation.Who's crazy now?</fullReview>

Believable, isn't it? - Two (yes, two) people dies because of the epidemic and in response the military occupies the town and start killing innocent civilians. -The sheriff's wife (who is the local doctor, of course) is catched by the military but she's pregnant (of course) thus she's resistant to the infection. - Nobody would notice that the American army will encompass a small city and later destroy it. That's an every day event in the US.And there is more and more from these stupidity, but that's enough. This movie is bad. Very, very bad. If you don't believe me, just watch it.

I found myself saying what was going to happen next at times of build-up, and sure enough I'd be right on or very close. Having not seen the original or any other remakes, I can't really compare. Timothy Olyphant does a good job with the leading role as sheriff (better than his lead in Hit-man), and the supporting cast is good enough where you can wary the story and not be upset at what happens to them. There is really nothing bad about this movie as long as the viewer knows not to take it for any more or less than what it is.

		<shortDescription>The Crazies: not really very good at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I left the theater, paint by numbers, was the immediate term that came to mind . This is a movie where the cookie cutter characters, are in stark contrast to the sharp cinematography; just like how a couple stylish but ultimately un-fulfilling scenes of violence, are in sharp contrast to the flat characters the violence is happening too.For every good thing about 'the Crazies' remake, there's another much more obvious flaw. The whole thing has a lot of potential, good pacing, and a some strong bits of atmosphere, but ultimately falls flat. Capable of large acts of cruelness, but the characters that these acts of violence happen too don't matter to the viewer; and because of this the violence doesn't matter to the viewer and that means the Crazies isn't scary, or exciting, the characters aren't gripping, and the movie is boring because it relies on it's violence but never really makes us care about who the violence is happening too. The Characters in the crazies are not only dull, but often quite annoying; they seem like they may be picked from a book of clichés and are capable of astoundingly bad leaps in logic. Including down right ignoring Russell's descent into madness, until the point that it is obvious to the audience by the time the characters realize that there is something wrong. (Spoiler) The military as is so often the case are also presented as having no rhyme or meter to the way there actions, other then evil. going from rounding up the populace, and dividing them between "Infected" and "Healthy" only too murder all of them with flame throwers; They separate children from mothers, they separate brothers and sisters just so they can burn everyone to death at separate locations weather infected or not. Then when the army gets sick of that, they start going door to door and burning families in there back yard. They do all this, while sending troops into an contagious zone, risking there own troops too kill there civilians; when they could have just dropped a bomb on the town. (End Spoiler)The movie's filled with lots of pseudo-social commentary, visual references are made: some too the holocaust, and genocides; others more in line with the current age of terrorism, fear and satellite surveillance but no actual message is presented to the viewer other then "The government will kill you." Any real message is lost in sensationalism. In a lot of ways it reminded me another big budget horror, movie with tons of Pseudo-social commentary: The Happening. Cast members wait around with dull looks in there eyes, until the script dictates they act crazy and get killed; with no reason other then too keep the plot moving, like a zombie stuck in a hedge maze it just knows too keep moving without any idea where its really going, or more importantly why.'The Crazies' is apathetic, and careless with it's characters and plot; shot with some degree of skill, although it unfortunately is lacking in logic or any heart. If they had of taken some real care with this film it could have been something worth remembering, but it doesn't seem anyone but the sfx department, and the cinematographer cared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After seeing the Original at the age of eight, I really loved the film. It had everything one could ask for. When I heard there would be a remake, I was thrilled. So I waited till the DVD came out and I rented it. However I was quickly disappointed. Everything was so predictable, probably because I saw the first, but still I connected the dots and yawned. I tried to like something aboutthe film, however it just didn't stand up to the par for me. If you want to see something really gruesome, watch the very first one. But if you, for some reason, don't like older film or want to rush into things, Then this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>World without plan; yet so predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how much of Hollywood was invented from inside - DW Griffith, Chaplin, where objects cast no shadow - and how much cross-polinated once the Germans came over, with their notions about the world at large cast from shadows as worked over in noir and horror; it's something I'll be looking into with a bunch of films I have planned.Still, horror as we know it from Germany beckoned from places unmapped but with boundaries well defined. Here was home, where fear may occasionally intrude but is nevertheless dispelled by some understanding of its supernatural mechanism, and beyond was the unspeakable. There was, always, a threshold to cross signified by portents of doom. A bunch of films helped change all that - Psycho, Body Snatchers, The Last Man on Earth-, the purest vision being Night of the Living Dead; now the fabric of the world entire was chaos pulling at the seams and we were forced to barricade inside the mind. In its own way, it situated us back into the spooky castle or mansion, only now there was nowhere to hide from it - the entire world was the monster's den.The most interesting notion that has come from all this is the first-person zombie film. Here mind and eye are literally aligned, and our vision is limited to what the paranoid mind sees. Nothing much has come from this yet, probably due to a lack of talented filmmakers to take it up.So, there's been an immense proliferation of these films in every possible combinations over the years, that perhaps they don't register like they once did. Look at this; a bunch of boundaries predictably blurred - of course we're meant to ask ourselves who are, really, 'the crazies' - a host of paranoid inversals that render the world moot chaos. Persons of authority on both sides, who should instruct order, shown to be hapless pawns fumbling in the blind. And, of course, one of the good guys succumbing, so who to trust? But it's all so tepid by now, so often seen before. We've been so accustomed to the idea of terror next-door, a world without plan, or faceless authorities getting away with shady schemes on the back of the public, that nothing of this has the power to dismantle or reveal. Shadows have been polished away. What was once intuitively engineered by Romero to jolt into consciousness, is now mechanically reworked for the multiplex.What I'm left with, is the unspoken relish of an abandoned world; an enduring image so often used as signifier in these films, is that of an empty super-market. The sight exhilarates. I could do without the film though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like a bunch of other dozen films, "The Crazies" deals with zombies, infection, army, evacuation and stuff like that. From this, automatically you remember "Resident Evil", "Rec, "Quarentine", among others.The story is nice, OK, but unoriginal. The cast is regular, OK I hate Timothy Olyphant since "The Girl Next Door", but he's not a bad actor. So, the story runs not so slowly, but it feels like the writer has nothing to add to the story, so he just writes thousand of scenes where the main actors walk and walk because they have nothing to do. I had to fast forward by the 90 minutes because of the boredom, but I'm sure some of you will love this. Not me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting remake full of action , tension ,thrills and creepy moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A military plane carrying biological weapon gone awry is only the start of problems in the little Midwestern town of Iowa. Bouts of insanity in the populace , realising a plague of murderous madness that are leading to kill and rioting, until the US Army turns up and things really start going to hell. In a little town an aircraft crashes on the hill releasing for some days in the water the bacteriological experimental germ warfare virus that affects only human beings. The military attempts to contain a man made combat virus that causes death and permanent insanity in those infected, as it overtakes the crowd .The army seals off the town to contain the virus and there is no antidote for the victims that are doomed to die or turn incurably crazy. The virus drives its victims mad before killing them, with a difficult line between normal hysteria and actual insanity . Meanwhile townspeople rebel , defy soldiers and the sheriff (Timothy Oliphant), his deputy (Joe Anderson), his wife (Radha Mitchell) and her medical assistant (Danielle Panabaker) escape.This is a remake based on the 70s George A Romero film dealing with the inhabitants of a small Iowa town suddenly plagued by insanity and then die after a mysterious toxin contaminates their water supply . The main plot premise echoes ¨The Andromeda strain¨ , an accident with a virus creates a terrifying civil emergency and incidentally reveals that the Us government is working towards germ warfare. The film packs violent action , fights , shootouts , including good dialog and performances, too . Director Breck Eisner tries to make a statement about martial law while attempting to capitalize on the successful first version , adding lots of blood and guts .There's plenty of moments of gore and a number of scenes that are quite horrific. The premise is simple but efficient: the malfunctioning and ambition of the human race is much scarier than any fictional horror monster could ever be .Realization is nicely done, providing tense atmosphere and using the rural locations of Iowa well. Eerie and suspenseful musical score by Mark Isham . Atmospheric and colorful cinematography by Maxime Alexandre .The motion picture is professionally directed by Breck Eisner (formerly directed the hit ¨Sahara¨) , though with no originality because it results to be a modern copy from original . Rating : Acceptable and passable .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The basic content of this type of film should surprise no-one. The only question is: is it any good? Sadly, 'The Crazies' is pretty mediocre. You never really care what happens to our two-dimensional 'scooby gang' and the story offers nothing new to the genre.More annoyingly, the film doesn't seem to know how to present 'the infected'. One minute they're red-eyed, rage monsters (see 28 Days Later), the next they're vacant, talking zombies who are easily offended (see, er, no film in particular). And zombies with guns? Nah.If you like zombie flicks (and I love them) then it will probably fill a gap but don't expect much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tedious and unnecessary remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies (1973) is one of the least famous movies in director and screenwriter George A. Romero's filmography, but I personally liked it very much, because besides of having excellent moments of tension and violence, it tells a story which is rich on its meaning and very well structured, which does not loose the time in divisions between heroes and villains, but which instead focuses into the realistic examination of a horrible situation which is observed by different points of view. Unfortunately, that reflexive tone is absolutely absent in the recent remake of that film, which ended up being a tedious horror film with absolutely nothing of the narrative deepness from the original film.One of the things I most liked in the original The Crazies is that it divided its narrative between the inhabitants from the contaminated town and the military who were searching for a cure of the illness, or at least trying for it to extend. That division made the spectator to comprehend the difficult ethic decisions both groups had to face. Unfortunately, the remake reduces its focus to a small group of survivors who live the typical tribulations we have seen in practically every single post-apocalyptic film, from the desperate search of transport and refuge to the scenes of personal conflicts and fight for the power.Despite having poor material to work with, I have to admit that the actors from The Crazies (2010) made a good work with their roles: Timothy Olyphant feels credible as a sheriff who will do anything in order to protect his wife; Radha Mitchell brings energy and personality to the most generic character from the movie; Danielle Panabaker is effective as a "scream queen" (a role she had also interpreted in Friday the 13th -2009, another useless remake-); and Joe Anderson brings the best performance from the movie (at least by my point of view) as an unstable policeman. Pity that their competent performances are trapped into such a mediocre and lacking of any deepness movie.So, in conclusion, I found The Crazies (2010) to be a boring remake with a tedious screenplay which is full of logical holes (for example: how did not the sheriff though that the ONLY functioning car in the village would bring suspicions?). Besides, I did not see the point in making this remake when all the elements which made the original film to be unique and fascinating were omitted. And there have been so many movies about epidemics and biological threatens in recent years that The Crazies (2010) feels like more from the same. So, despite the performances, I cannot recommend this weak and unnecessary remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action MINUS Good Storytelling = The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was utterly disappointed by this movie. This was a mindless epidemic movie where you are supposed to forget about things like characterization of the townspeople (or anyone other than the lead 4/5 characters) or answers that would have actually taken thought regarding how the epidemic is spread, exactly what it is, etc.. You are just supposed to leave your brain at the door and stare in awe at the action on the screen and Ooh and Ahh at the scary scenes of the Crazies vs. the lead characters. It's all action and little to no explanation. I just saw this movie last night and aside from saying that a bioweapon contaminated the drinking water of the featured rural, small town, I really couldn't tell you much else regarding details. I am actually quite confused regarding the fate of certain characters because certain things were never explained. I am an educated, competent adult.. I shouldn't be walking away from a movie like this confused.I am all for a good guys against the world type of movie which is what the Crazies is - you have a core group of 4 characters (Mitchell, Olyphant, Panabaker and Anderson) versus the Crazies + the military who are there to contain the contamination BUT I want a smart epidemic movie.. one that has the scares and the special effects but also has the answers and has thought every detail through. The Crazies does not - it's about action and scares - not good storytelling.I am still scratching my head as to how the poison or is it a virus? Who knows (my point exactly..).. is spread. The water only? The blood of an infected as well? The air which was hinted at in the film? Who is immune? How are they immune? Why does nothing happen to Olyphant's character when he basically shares blood with an infected Crazy? None of this is answered.. Explanations like this were clearly not priorities.5/10 just because it held my attention but I'd only recommend this movie if you want to leave your brain at the door and just sit back and watch a thriller/horror film that relies on scares and special effects and stunts. Speaking of stunts.. per the average film of this genre, expect 'saved at the last second' ridiculous moments where the leads magically survive and of course the stunts that said characters do to evade death that most normal people would be killed from. It's just over the top stupidity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Formulaic remake packs no punch...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...despite being a serious step up in the production values department over the original George A. Romero shocker from 1973, and despite its plot line of government/military ruthlessness while containing a threatened pandemic of a deadly viral agent, the release of which, naturally, is thanks to the same government/military. The movie's ensemble, led by Timothy "Live Free or Die Hard" Olyphant and Radha "Pitch Black" Mitchell, with mostly superfluous support from Joe "The Ruins" Anderson and Danielle "Mr. Brooks" Panabaker, is miles ahead of the unknowns who populated Romero's version, and the DP work by Maxime "High Tension" Alexandre is far more accomplished, as is every other aspect of the film (including the score by Mark "Watch out, Mr. Elfman!" Isham), but the distressingly routine, paint-by-numbers script by Scott "The Machinist" Kosar and Ray "The Pulse" Wright simply doesn't offer anything that we haven't already heard (or seen) scores of times before.I will say, however, that I'm glad that George A. Romero seems to be finally getting his due. There's a somewhat obsequious tribute to him as an extra on the DVD, and I'm assuming he got at least a small chunk of change from whatever profits the film generated. It's just a shame that the retread version couldn't match his wit and style, nor the bite of his often trenchant commentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies (2010, R)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a high suspense horror film, "The Crazies" begins at a calm pace with creepy characters and slick snapshots of conspiracy theory. But then Breck Eisner, the director, and the writers zoom in on individual kill segments and chase the main character, Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), and his party of survivors around a rural farming town (Ogden Marsh, Iowa). The kills are a bit inventive at times, but the rescues are definitely not. It isn't a zombie film, Eisner opting instead for the contagion route: the town's people start behaving sometimes like silent, disoriented lunatics and sometimes like ruthless stalkers. But the attempts at paranoia ? in a weak effort to exploit the virus so that the survivors won't know who to trust ? are mostly confusing and didn't cause enough genuine feelings of deception.A gradual increase in suspense, however, is well done, especially in the terrific opening sequences. At a baseball game, a local man, named Rory Hamill, wanders onto the field with a drunken, crazy look and a rifle. A little later another local, Bill Farnum (Brett Rickaby), sits oddly at a doctor's office as if he's gone mad. Clever details ensue as Bill's son hides in a closet and tells his mother he saw dad with a knife. Bill creeps up the steps and locks his wife and son in a closet, torching the house on his way out.These sequences have a genuine sense of paranoia. Rory slowly wandering onto the baseball field is weird enough to make us wonder who is next. But elsewhere the "crazies" mostly run around as wild and aggressive killers. Not to sound like Yoda, but paranoia requires deception and deception requires you to mistake craziness for normality. It's a difficult trick to pull off. It works with Rory and Bill initially, but ultimately it fails. It's difficult to leave time for error when you are busy running away from a crazy person with a pitch fork.As the military try to control the situation with extreme measures, the story stays with the perspective of Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell), and his deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson). The three of them break out of military quarantine and try to find a way out of town, and past the military patrols, blockades, watchful helicopters, and communication blackouts. In George A. Romero's original 1973 version, the military was central to the story. Here the story spirals into the personal mayhem experienced by the Sheriff's party of survivors.Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) also starts acting erratically and a bit aggressively with his rifle, but it isn't clear whether he's just being careful, reactive (out of fear), or aggressive due to the contagion. What are the symptoms for being crazy anyways? For him to deceive us and give us a genuine feeling of paranoia (to the point of having nightmares over our next door neighbor turning into a "crazy"), we would need better information about how the symptoms work and whether he has them. It simply isn't clear that he does.Together the four of them walk through streets of fire and debris. They sometimes hide to avoid the military or the townsfolk. For example, they watch three odd characters hunting crazies. Or are they crazies themselves? It isn't clear, but for the rest of the film most anyone who is crazy, military, or outsider is out to harm anyone in their path. The military becomes especially destructive as they lose control of the situation. And since zombies aren't specifically involved, the "crazies" can use a bit of intelligence and a ready supply of lethal weapons (pitch forks, saws, knives, and guns) to add variety to the kill segments. The local school principal turns particularly ruthless with a pitch fork; hopefully not as a result of a writer's bad experience in school.The film tries increasing the tension with extreme paranoia (as best done by "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" and "The Thing"), but it gives us frightful kill scenes and maniacs instead, none of which deceive us to the degree of paranoia. Timothy Olyphant (from "Deadwood" and "Live Free or Die Hard") fits the role of the main survivor well. The best parts are perhaps the gradual opening scenes and small town charm, and it also has a couple conspiratorial special effect shots of satellite monitoring. Many of the kill segments are suspenseful and chilling for fans of slasher type horror. We get perfect locations for scare tactics, including a remote car wash and a truck station, and the kill scenes have sufficient moments of silent stalking to keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done remake; does justice to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of George A. Romero's 'The Crazies', it is an exciting, dark, intelligent virus-outbreak movie that is sorely underrated. Usually I think remakes are totally unnecessary but in this case I was actually happy, as it would draw attention to the Romero's 1973 hidden gem. Of course, there was always that constant question about how they would approach re-envisioning this for our generation. Personally, I think they did a good job of blending action and horror to create a fast-paced, yet well-made film. Director Breck Eisner is a relative newbie to horror (having directed an episode of the mediocre TV series 'Fear Itself'), but he shows plenty of talent here, doing justice to Romero's original and showing many other directors how remakes can be done well. He is helped by a fantastic cast: Timothy Olyphant ('Deadwood'), Radha Mitchell ('Rogue'), Joe Anderson ('Across the Universe'), and Danielle Panabaker ('Friday the 13th'), a decent screenplay and having Romero on board as a producer.The story is much the same as the original, a virus (Trixie) is accidentally unleashed upon the small town of Ogden Marsh, which turns people into crazy murderous psychopaths when infected. Sheriff Dutten (Olyphant), his wife Judy (Mitchell), deputy Russell Clank (Anderson), and Becca Darling (Panabaker) band together in an effort to get away from the ensuing madness.Overall this is a pretty good film, not perfect of course, the ending is slightly corny and too sequel friendly, and the military are presented in a pretty clichéd way which we have seen too much of recently, it's getting kinda boring now. But really, this is simply an enjoyable mix of horror and action, with enough gore and tension to keep most people entertained for its running time. The Crazies shows that remakes can be done well, and that modern horror has still got it. With a strong cast, a talented director, a good screenplay, and plenty of excitement, this is a movie I recommend to anyone looking to for a simple horror flick.3?/5</fullReview>

Breck Eisner did well behind the camera, he presented already seen horror and thriller movies substances in a reasonably fresh way. I was entertained by the reasonably fresh approach of this movie. The actors did very well. Timothy Olyphant acted very well, The Crazies is the second movie of him I've seen I first saw him in Die Hard 4 and he impressed me both times, I really think he is underrated. Radha Mitchell did a good job that's also the second time I saw of her, I first saw her in Surrogates and both of the time she impressed me a lot, she's also underrated. Joe Anderson did very well and I expect to see him doing good roles in the future. Danielle Panabaker also did well. I would've gave this movie a 9/10 but there are some important things in it that should be addressed explicitly but wasn't addressed or wasn't address explicitly.Overall, The Crazies entertained me most of the runtime and I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are a surprising number of films which have followed George Romero's lead in the field of zombies or zombie-like features. Here is one of the better ones. The Movie, directed by Breck Eisner is called " The Crazies " and follows the standard formula involving the clumsy military. Having developed a new biological weapon, the military flies it across the country, only to have it crash and sink in a dense wood near the towns' main river. The estuary is contaminated and mixes directly with the town's drinking water. David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) is the small town sheriff who with his wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell) and Russell Clank, an action oriented Deputy (Joe Anderson) begin dealing with an ever increasing population of zombie-like citizens who began acting erratically, then explode into maniacal madmen. The movie's story was written by Scott Kosar and Ray Wright and is interesting in many aspects, primarily with regards to the hero. The film does portray the sheriff as capable and resilient, but it is his deputy who saves him time after time. With the exception of the myopic military, the exciting movie is incredibly action oriented with shootings, killings and hyper-action sequences. Audiences will enjoy this film as it is so underrated. ****</fullReview>

For one thing - and this is remarkable - the acting is really good. Olyphant's been justly praised for his measured performance, but Anderson deserves greater credit for breathing life and sheer credibility into a character that so, so easily would have been caricature: the redneck deputy. Then, director Eisner doesn't resort to excessive slasher moments at all, which to an old film fan like me is a gift from heaven. All in all, 'The Crazies' delivers. Not a great deal, but it delivers. Oh! But how I would've have loved it if, just this once, the leading two characters didn't split up towards the end. Really, Eisner. They've had AMPLE experience of crazies popping up in otherwise deserted spaces. They are pretty much all each other has. And...he goes to fetch supplies and hijack a truck as SHE SITS ALONE IN THE DINER. Yeesh.</fullReview>

The acting from Olyphant and Mitchell was great - but that was about it for great acting. If you like George A Romeo's style and ending to films you will love this. Anderson was too much over the top in a Eli Roth sort of manner to fit in with the better acting of Olyphant really. The atmosphere of the film was great though, you feel worried, intrigued and have a sense of urgency needed. Give it a go, its better than an average slasher flick thats for sure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best horror movie of 2010</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>¨Welcome to Ogden Marsh, the friendliest place on earth.¨ The Crazies will surely be a pleasant surprise for horror fans. This is a really well made horror/suspense movie that is actually hard to come across nowadays. It is by far the best scary movie of the year and will be very hard to top because it is very well made, the location is perfect, the cast is credible, and the timing of the film is excellent. The Crazies is actually a remake of George A Romero's 1973 movie of the same title, which I never got around seeing, but critics are saying that this version is actually better than the original. The screenplay for the original was written by Romero and one of his closest friends, and in this remake a much more mature Romero is involved with the production of the film which probably contributed to the success of the movie. Breck Eisner (who directed Sahara) directs The Crazies and it is his best film to date. Hopefully he will get more involved with this dying genre and deliver some more scares in the future. The adapted screenplay was written by Scott Kosar (The Machinist and The Amityville Horror) and Ray Wright (Case 39 and Pulse) who really are one of the main reasons for the success of the movie because they created a convincing plot with believable dialogues, and that is an important part of a horror movie that has been missing in these films. There are also several frightening and gory scenes that will please fans of the genre, but for me the key was how the suspense was built from the beginning and kept until the very end with good performances from the cast.The story takes place in a small town in Iowa called Ogden Marsh where the population is a little over one thousand. Most everyone knows each other in the town that is protected by the sheriff David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant from Hit-man and The Girl Next Door) and his deputy Russell (Joe Anderson from The Ruins and Across the Universe). David's wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell from Surrogates and Silent Hill) is the doctor of the peaceful town and they all seem to have a very good life. One sunny day when the boys are at a local baseball game one of the men walks into the field with a shotgun acting strange. David tells the boys to get off the field and he goes to confront the man who he is familiar with. David asks him to put down the shotgun, but the man just doesn't seem to listen and continues to act in a strange manner. Suddenly he points his shotguns at David and the sheriff has no other alternative than to shoot him down. Everyone is shocked by what they have just seen, and the only explanation was that the man was drunk since he used to be the town drunk although he had been clean over the last couple of years. After that incident the people of Ogden Marsh begin to act strange, or should I say crazy in honor of the title, and they become a menace towards each other. David discovers that an airplane carrying some sort of biohazard weapon has crashed in the lake polluting the water and the virus has begun spreading in his town. To make matters worse the military has shut down their communication and quarantined the area.The Crazies works really well as a suspense horror movie and has several frightening scenes. The most memorable one is the car wash scene, but there are also some very good ones at the quarantine tent, the hospital, a gas station, and at David's house. The location for each one of the scenes contributed very well to the movie and Timothy Olyphant did a great job as the lead character. Joe Anderson also gave a good performance, but one of the flaws in the movie is how his character switches moods near the end of the film. Radha Mitchell is always a sure bet and she has done these frightening scenes in the past in Silent Hill. This movie was a real nice surprise for me and I really had a fun time watching The Crazies.

		<shortDescription>Nothing to infectious about this movie, though it does increase my desire to see the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horror movie was somewhat good, had some really good parts too. It also had a few boring stretches along the way as well. Seemed to be a bit to long also. A scene where the people infected were running wild all over the small town never materialized either so that was a bit disappointing. Still, I enjoyed this story about a small town that becomes infected by a strange new viral weapon and must be quarantined. That is about the gist of the story, most of the film follows the local sheriff and his deputy and the wife of the sheriff trying to get out of the town and passed the barricades of military men. A few unexpected scenes here and there, and a surprisingly really great shot of the sheriff and wife looking back on the town. Another great scene was when they discovered the plane. As for gore, the best of the gore is a scene where someone comes into a room with patients and he has a pitchfork and he is one of the crazies. Other than that there are some good head shots here and there, but nothing to extreme which is a bit surprising as usually when a horror movie is made by a smaller company as this one was they ramp up the gore a bit more. No nudity in this one either, but that is okay, it makes up for it by having some great tense situations. Though the film also suffers from one to many scenes of person in room and you see one of the infected lurking in the background. The guy playing the sheriff is a good lead here as was his deputy. The wife also did a nice job. So aside from a few problems here and there overall I enjoyed this movie and now wish to see the original film made by Romero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There Is A Reason To Go Crazy Over The Crazies (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies follows a small town (Of 1,200 to be exact) that is ravaged by a mysterious virus that causes it's victims to go crazy. The Crazies had little going for it. It was a remake of a not so popular (Outside of genre fans) 70's film. It was also being overshadowed by being released right after The Wolfman and two months before A Nightmare on Elm Street and Piranha before it moved to its current date. Many people thought it looked to ridiculous to watch. Given all of these factors its amazing it did so well at the box office.The Crazies was very well done. The leads (Olyphant, Panabaker, Mitchell, and Anderson) were all giving great performances. You had the feeling like you could have known Olyphant and Mitchell as a couple in your neighborhood. Or Panabaker's character from your local high school. They seemed real and that was a very good thing that came from the film, characters you genuinely cared about.Another pro about The Crazies was the atmosphere. It always felt desolate and it looked like any Spring Day in Iowa.But, there were some pacing problems. The film had established a fairly fast pace at the beginning and then it just fell apart near the middle of the film (Pacing) after that. It felt uneven and it was a bit distracting.Many of the night sections of The Crazies were too dark and you couldn't see the action. (Think Alien Versus Predator Requiem-dark) It was almost impossible to tell who was where and what was what. Overall the film was a fun, thriller horror film and I personally hope that people paid attention to it and took some notes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Everyone we know...is dead. This town is dead, and it's not coming back. It's never coming back."I've been on a bit of a Radha Mitchell marathon lately, and that continues with The Crazies. Sometimes a movie doesn't really add anything new or venture too far beyond the tried and true, but it still manages to be really enjoyable. That's this movie, in a nutshell.&nbsp;The story is something that most horror fans will already have seen several times. A dangerous virus is accidentally released in a civilian area, and all hell breaks loose. This particular virus makes people extremely violent, and crazy is a good description of how they act. A small group of seemingly uninfected people try to escape the small town, while evading the military and the infected townspeople. The result is two hours of lots of people getting killed in various ways.&nbsp;The Crazies does rely on jump scares a little too often, and it's not particularly frightening. And it got a little tiresome to see the protagonists blithely making way too much noise when they should have been being quiet, or constantly (and unnecessarily) separating - leading to most of the perilous situations in the movie. The oddest thing is how the "rules" about the infected people seem to change. Some of the crazies are zombie-like and unintelligent, and some of the speak and act like normal (albeit, very violent) people. &nbsp;Despite those tired clichés, I can honestly say that I enjoyed The Crazies. The cast is pretty good, and there a few cool scenes that will stick with you after it's all over. It was good enough to make me want to check out the original movie. If you haven't tired of these kind of biological disaster movies, give it a shot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Zombies that shoot back"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Zombies...It doesn't matter how they get created its the very existence of theirs that looks so appealing to audience. They snarl, growl, and in this flick shoot from the weapons, drive trucks, and apparently work at the car wash...for free! Movie writers (I always have to suggest there were plenty of them...one person would have much more ideas), decided that the whole Zombie concept needed reality. Reality here is that Zombies AI is upgraded, army men are trigger happy (would you look at that...), main characters are teleporting in between. Reality shows us that zombies can emerge from all kind of situations that go wrong. Like...for example, you are reading a stupid flick comment on your precious device while drinking coffee in your room, not realizing that the whole town is behaving more quiet than usual. The floor is giving noises but you are sure that no one is there, and that you're pretty much alone. Suddenly a bullet comes flying through your door smashing the computer...a creature opens the door, and voil? a zombie with a gun! It doesn't matter how many zombie flick you make, or how elaborate or not the story is, at the end is a movie that leaves you more stupid than you've been before seeing it. I stand behind my statement that zombie movies simply aren't scary enough, and no amount of butchering or makeup, artificial (undead) AI, cool guys who almost always save their girlfriends, "in the middle of no where scenes", government implications ( direct or indirect), only one half of the character development, practice of acting scared and screaming (girl screams is a directors misogyny)...will stimulate that thing in your head called brain. (btw Zombies love your brains...directors not so much, just your pocket!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remakes are indeed a touchy subject, since if you're going to make one, you have to pay close attention to the original and avoid making a word for word copy of the original. Remakes of a horror movie are even more touchy, since you'll have to please both the casual viewers and the cult followers of the said horror movie, which in this case, means pleasing the many Romero fans out there with this modern take on the 70's "The Crazies." Thankfully, this one doesn't fall in the trap of being a word for word copy but everything else they added wasn't all that good. For one, the trailer pretty much spoiled the ENTIRE movie, not just a couple of the "scare" scenes (you'll understand if you saw the trailer before watching the actual movie). Also, the scare tactics in this movie were cheap; just add a scary musical chord here and slap on some infected going crazy or military personnel going crazy too. Also character deaths are very predictable if you've seen enough of this genre. It's thanks to that that there is not much love lost every time someone dies, which is a shame.Another main problem with the film is its pacing. While it does help build the atmosphere of traveling through what remains of Ogden Marsh, the movie sometimes ends up dragging most of the scenes. Aside from that, you're left with a pretty good horror film. While not exactly the best of the "infected-versus-crazy-military" genre ("28 Days" and stuff like that), this one should be a good way to pass the time. Too bad it's a bit forgettable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Run-of-the-mill horror-thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this film, a government plane carrying a dangerous virus crashes near a small town. The virus finds its way into the town's drinking water, turning everyone who is exposed to it into a murderous lunatic. Sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant) and his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell), remain unaffected but face great danger in trying to escape the town, which has been quarantined by the US army, whose members lurk around every corner, clad in gas masks and protective suits.In the age of remakes here is another one. I haven't seen the original and the remake didn't make me want to. To be honest, this is a completely average horror flick. There's nothing new or even a different spin on things. The story starts interesting but after a while it stagnates and there's no way it can go. The last hour of the film is basically the protagonists fighting the crazies ( who's behavior is identical to zombies) and trying to escape...you know, the usual and therefor, this thriller quickly becomes just another "zombie flick".To make matters worse, there's a lot of over-acting and Timothy Olyphant was a bit bland. It's not all bad though, The Crazies is somewhat entertaining and the perfect film to watch on a boring night but, the film is average at best. Just another director/studio trying to cash in on yesterday's classics.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There've been a lot of zombie films in the last few years, ranging from the comic "Shaun of the Dead" to the terrifying "28 Days Later" (though the latter is included only if you use a very broad definition of the term "zombie").Here we have another entry in the genre where people are converted to slavering, brain-dead killers by a disease ? in this case, one developed as a biological weapon, then accidentally released when a US air force plane transporting it crashes near a small town in Iowa.The film is certainly fast moving. The first incident showing us something is wrong is under way within two minutes and we are not left much time to draw breath after that. The slight twist at the end was one I didn't see coming at all, so the film gets an extra point for that.Technical standards are good, but the music is negligible.The cast is given plenty to do in the running-about-and-being-shot-at department, but not much in that of characterization. A nod for versatility, however, goes to British actor Joe Anderson, who plays the definitively American Deputy Russell Clank. The last movie I saw Anderson in was "The Ruins" (2008) where he played a German! Accents are evidently his strong point.All in all, then, this was an entertaining, fast moving, and reasonably well acted effort. Very lightweight, but sometimes that's all it takes.Rating: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's just say that this movie didn't have many redeeming qualities.It wasn't very good, to be frank. I'm definitely a fan of the terribly awesome horror movie and this wasn't good enough to be a legitimate quality film and not bad enough to be worth watching for the laughs.The dialog was especially weak, the horror was based on shock value and overly-squishy sound effects accompanying unnecessary gore.Joe Anderson is easily the best part of the movie, making it semi-watchable, as his performance comes off as though he, too, thinks the movie is a bad joke. He also gets to do some feats of mild badassery.And I don't think I want to investigate any other Eisner movies. Direction was sloppy, at best.Well, at least the ridiculousness was laughable sometimes.Take your time in seeing this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's about time to go Crazy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the original The Crazies (1973) way back in 1994-5ish with my current (and then) roommate and laughing all the way through it. Laughing at its extremely low budget, perhaps, or maybe because I was in too much of a good mood for the dark &amp; dreary tale of killer virus and the big bad government's inevitable cover-up. He was none too happy about my mocking of the movie, to say the least. Especially when I chuckled at one of the lines: (something like) "Yeah, I need that like I need a hole in my head." My response: "Well, I hope you have at least one hole in your head! I have a minimum of 5 (pointing to nose, ears and mouth) not to mention millions more I cannot see!" Yeah, I realize that has little to do with the latest horror-remake, The Crazies (2010) but it did make me appreciate this update all the more. In fact, even though not seeing the original in approximately 15 years, I can safely say this movie was far superior. Beyond the obvious comparisons, since it is, of course, yet another horror remake, I will state it is actually a good movie.Great? No. Predictable? Yes, even down to who's going to die and when, including inanimate objects. But enjoyable all the same; it's vicious, violent and shows what true horror is based on.Barely wasting any screen time, and yet it still established the feel of a small-Iowa town, the movie practically dives right into the first of many "crazies" or ill individuals. In this case, a man walks out into baseball field during a high school game in progress with a shotgun. Sheriff Dutton (Olyphant) confronts the man, a friend of his (i.e. more proof of small-town America) and sees something in the man's eyes prior to having to shoot him when the man fails to comply with putting the pointed shot gun down.There begins the mystery (and occurrences of "crazy" acts) of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. But, not for long. After it's soon discovered the source of the quiet-town-folk-turned-homicidal ? a fallen military plane transporting a deadly virus into the town's water supply, the movie turns into the ultimate government cover-up (as usual.) Now, Dutton, his wife, her employee and Dutton's deputy have to escape avoiding both their former friend's vengeance and cold-blooded attacks from the military.I found little wrong in this movie, and a lot more right. Such as acting. As usual, one of my all time favorite actors, Olyphant, does a superb job of toning down his usual, for lack of a better word, crazy and over-the-top acting to a degree, fitting the role perfectly. When he does speak out, you will see the true Olyphant. He adds so much to his character, the movie, humor to the necessary spots and true love of his wife, played by Mitchell. She also does a great job, stealing every scene she's in. Finally, Hollywood Horror gives us credible, believable and true characters to root for.No one pulled a Superman in this movie. They made mistakes and tried their best to deal with the unique situation they were thrust into. And even the military knew what they were doing was wrong, albeit a tough decision (as shown by a slightly captured soldier, played by Reegan.) The script was good and tight, and despite (previously mentioned) predictable, at least it transitioned you into the next scene with ease, leaving just the important parts completely impressing me. Also, the suspense was very good. Two of the best scenes were the Sheriff being thrown under a Semi to do battle and a wonderfully unique way of using a car wash for horror.Highly recommended for the crowds liking to be scared, but in a movie with a much higher level than not only most horror-remakes, but any horror thrillers of recent years. And if you're one not to watch these movies over and over (namely like me) you may not be able to predict it throughout, including the closing. So for those who like to be scared a little bit and save a horror movie on your list but once every couple of years, this is the one to pick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Would be good for Sy-Fy Channel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe a viewer's enjoyment of this film will depend a lot on whether they can take extreme gore and those shock-surprise cuts (the "Boo!" effect). I probably would have given the film another star had the director shown some restraint.Overall, the screenplay was decent and the acting also. The film quickly established a very creepy atmosphere. There were some plot holes: For example, I don't think the zombies would tie someone to a chair with duct tape, certainly not as quickly as it was done in this film. And they're not really zombies, are they? Because they didn't have to die first before they started acting like that. And they obviously could be killed. And the amount of time used to "plant" the cigarette lighter would certainly be a tip that it would figure prominently in the plot. This is the kind of film now seen regularly on the Sy-Fy Channel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When the Remake is Better than the Original Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Pierce County, Iowa, the Sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant) is forced to kill the local Rory Hamill (Mike Hickman) that is threatening the community in a baseball game with a rifle and an insane behavior. Then his wife Dr. Judy (Radha Mitchell) examines another local, Bill Farnum (Brett Rickaby), who has a strange behavior. In the night, Bill traps his wife and son in the room and then he burns their house to the ground. On the next morning, David and his Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) are called by three hunters that had found a dead pilot in the Hopman Bog. David and Russell find a big airplane in the bottom of the bog. Sooner the army seals off the town and imprisons the population in tents and concentration camps. David, Russell, Judy and her assistant Becca (Danielle Panabaker) escape and sooner they discover that the plane was airborne with a biological weapon and crashed contaminating the water supply of the population. Further, there is no antidote for the victims that are doomed to die or become incurably mad. The quartet tries to find a breach in the containment to reach the next town, but the escapees are hunted by the army. I usually hate remakes, but "The Crazies" (2010) is a rare case when the remake is better than the original film of George Romero. The tense plot is slightly different from the original story of 1973 that reflected the paranoia of those years of Cold War. Further, the plot focuses in the personal drama of David and Judy and not in the military action like in the 1973 movie. The screenplay, direction and performances are above average and this film worth watching. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Epidemia" ("The Epidemics")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Romero remake, recommended!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just saw this at a matinée. Much better than I expected! Constant action with a great sense of pacing, tension-filled (the scene in the car wash is particularly terrifying). The acting is surprisingly strong for a Romero-related movie. Big budget too, which helps. The setting (Ogden Marsh, Iowa) is the perfect place for an outbreak-type movie- lots of great cinematography of vast, open fields and sky. While technically speaking, The Crazies is not exactly a zombie movie (the infected are still alive and somewhat intelligent), this is an interesting variation on the genre. Not as gory as the Dawn of the Dead remake, but still a lotta blood gets spilled. And the social commentary is still there, as well. Great remake and the best movie I've seen this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely unimpressive while it shows potential for a real disturbing movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I guess disturbing just does make the cut when it comes to green-lighting a well-packaged genre movie. The Crazies is well too clean, too polished. My main grief is that it's just another zombie movie, and not a great one for clean and polished are certainly nowhere on that checklist.While I am a big fan of Romero's I haven't seen the original. I read myself into thinking the remake was better, and I admit that Romero's zombie movies all deserve a nice update... that is except for the first one, Night of the Living Dead. Dawn of the Dead certainly deserved an update and it got a good one.Now I regret I haven't watched the original in the first place. First it seems that in Romero's movie contaminated people were hard to tell from the sane one, which was a great tension device, helping to avoid to trap of telling the same zombie movie over again. Then it was much more, from what I read, about fleeing the military who come to contain the epidemic at all costs.Other than the 'yet another zombie movie feeling' I felt the main characters were quite stereotypical. Another reviewer mentioned they looked directly borrowed from the Dawn of the Dead remake. Whereas it doesn't look cheap - cheap is not necessarily bad for genre movies - the whole plot lacks tension as action moves from one point to the next without a close continuity helping to build up the sense of loneliness and weakness in the face of disturbing events.I will now track down the original Crazies, and I am really disappointed they were only able to issue this innocuous version while a remake means you ought to bring in your own creative stuff.</fullReview>

What was the point in YET another zombie movie remake?Zombies have been all the rage for the past few years, so... everything (I mean EVERYTHING) in this movie has been done before. Many times. Much better. You have seen all of this before; it brings nothing new to the table. No creativity, no originality, no invention.Just dull and predictable.The protagonist (the sheriff) does a semi-decent job, but that's about it. I thought he was too young for the role, though.The scares are predictable and not really scary.Gore does not equal suspense.Even though the premise is kind of good, the plot is full of holes, the characters aren't developed well enough, and the whole thing is not very convincing.You're not supposed to be BORED during a HORROR movie, but I was.Like I said, there's hardly any suspense, and it doesn't help that the characters are unlikeable, so you have no desire to root for them.One word to describe this movie: FORGETTABLE.I still remember exactly what went on in "Resident Evil" and the rest of the (good) movies I listed at the beginning of this review, but "The Crazies"...? I just remember that it was BAD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done remake!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the original "The Crazies" a while back. It was one of those films that was enjoyable to watch, but really was only eye candy. I still liked it as a film, though, and I loved Romero's touch with that simple idea of infection that dominates most of his films.When I saw there was going to be a remake, I instantly was scared. Not that Romero's film was a masterpiece, but I was still hesitant for someone to remake it. I was even hesitant to see it, simply because I was scared that this remake would be like many of the others that were dominating this decade.I was pleasantly surprised. Not only did the remake satisfy me, it exceeded the original in certain aspects.For one, the casting was excellent. Timothy Olyphant is really hit or miss for me, but in this film he was great. He played his role well and he seemed, for the most part, very believable. Radha Mitchell did a very good job as well. The two of them combined was a very well done performance, and their chemistry was spot on. Their relationship was very believable. Both of them are very good at portraying emotion, which was critical in this film, as well as just being good actors in general.Moving away from the acting, Breck Eisner (the director), brought a unique vision to the film. It seemed grittier, more intense, than the original which I absolutely loved. The shots were well placed, lighting very well done, and the writing was also great. It seemed like the crew wanted to make as good a movie as possible, instead of just a carbon copy of what Romero did, which worked very well.The only part that did not work for me was the ending. It seemed like it was too quick, that they were pulling out before the story had truly finished. It shocked me, but not in a good way. This wasn't like a Sixth Sense kind of shock, it was more of a "what just happened" shock. Even though this can be useful in some films, The Crazies was just not the place I wanted to see it in.Overall, I think this film is even better than Romero's only because of how well it was treated and how stunningly different it was from the original, while staying true to the plot. I urge people to see both versions however, because Romero's film is great to watch as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies (2010)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right from the start, I think I liked 'The Crazies'. Before the Participant media logo had even vanished from the screen, I think I was biased. I feel like most people thought that 'The Crazies' was just a boring, played-out, stale idea right before it even hit the shelves in 2010. I saw this film in the the theater, and I remember it well as most will with a film they enjoyed seen in a cinema. But anyway, Timothy Olyphant, who we will all recognize as our killer from 'Scream 2' (or one of them, at least) is now our small-town sheriff ten years later, and we're more comfortable with that now. Radha Mitchell is his wife, who I really own know from a handful of mostly forgettable flicks, and our remaining cast of nobodies that we've probably all seen on assorted TV shows, but they all do it great. It's like watching a season of 'The Andy Griffith Show' gone awry. Or Andy Griffith and gang meeting the people from 'The Walking Dead'. But then there would be too much drama, and not enough actually happening on screen to keep us interested.The plot of 'The Crazies' develops quickly, as it should... it's a remake. I haven't seen the original Romero flick, but we all know the gist of it, so let's get on with it. The directors and the cinematographers all clearly knew what they were doing the entire time, and they build the tension nicely. The tense moments are weighed in perfectly with the down-time, which is really when they develop their story and the whole Big Brother eye-in-the-sky was really good and accurate at the time, I thought. It seemed like something that could happen anywhere. This is not something I would just call average horror schleck. I would actually consider this a valuable example of almost expert horror filmmaking of the time, while still being able to have fun at the same time.THE CRAZIES -----8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is entertaining enough, and I thought the performances of the actors were just fine. As was the direction and cinematography. My primary issue with the movie is that it's been done to death. I'm not sure how in this day and age a writer can even sell a script about an accidental government chemical spill that turns small town people into zombies and the only person who can save them is the Sheriff.****POSSIBLE SPOILER****??Firstly, I don't consider anything above a spoiler. The entire plot and outcome of the movie is obvious within the first 7 to 10 minutes. One thing that would have given this movie an original spin, if only for a scene or two, is if Judy's fetus had become infected with the zombie chemical and had dug its way out of her. Now THAT would have rocked...OR...if Judy had simply been further along in her pregnancy so that it became a real obstacle in their survival. As it is, her being pregnant is pretty much a non-issue and not really used to drive the movie forward at all.Still a great movie to watch on a Thursday morning when stuck home with the flu...like I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over the past several years, the film industry has become overrun with movies about people becoming infected by a virus who the turn to killing everyone around them. '28 Days Later' has been one of the most popular and for a British made horror film, is actually one of the better ones. Then enter 'The Crazies.' Set in the town of Ogden Marsh, the small community go about their normal day to day business. David and Judy Dutton are the town's Sheriff and doctor respectively both of who are well liked in the close-knit town community. Suddenly strange things begin to happen; people start acting oddly and appear to be prone to violence. As the body count starts to add up and with the town in disarray, the government soon arrives to cordon the town off. Then the true reality of 'the crazies,' is realised.The actors portray some strong performances, which adds depth to their characters. The movie is perfectly paced, and there are some intense sequences, with some incredible inventive gore. The direction is impressive and i believe there was a lot of attention to detail here. It is apparent also that the director did not depend solely on the violence within the content of the film. The way certain sequences are edited, they cut away from some of the more graphic moments, which coincidentally gives more of a psychological impact on an audience.One of the elements which i thoroughly liked about this film, is that it doesn't waste any time trying to discover the reason for the 'crazie' behaviour, the focus is that of the survivors and how they react to the situation they find themselves entangled in. Although the twists in the narrative are predictable at times, the film carries a tense atmosphere right to the end.Even though the concept is nothing original, the film was made stylistic and carried the narrative through a lot more effectively than some others. One of the better horror films of this century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not horrible but not good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I watched 2010's the crazies, well was it good it was watchable. This is a movie that is yet another remake of a supposedly superior cult movie. I haven't seen the original but I am intrigued. The story is not unfamiliar government releases bio toxin that turns members of a small town into crazed killers. There are many holes in the plot, And any social commentary from the original is underplayed. There are some good scares, and some moments that aren't completely predictable. I can't say I recommend it but I can't say it was horribly made either. Look I saw this on my dish, if someone In time besides my two loyal readers see's this review and is curious (or heck them as well), and are intrigued enough to watch this flick, something tells me you might be happier with the original. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slam-Bang Horror Action, You'll get what you paid for.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a toxin begins to turn the residents of Ogden Marsh, Iowa into violent psychopaths, sheriff David Dutton tries to make sense of the situation while he, his wife, and two other unaffected townspeople band together in a fight for survival.The Crazies is thankfully action orientated unlike the boring social commentary that was the first. It owes a lot too many other horror films in this genre but it does it with flair and style, delivering some effective action sequences combining them with the horror thrills you would expect. I heavily enjoyed it for what it was, a slam bang horror actioner with likable leads and a good story, doesn't get any simpler then that. Timothy Olyphant is a great lead. His macho characteristics, along with his charisma to back it up work great here, and Radha Mitchell performed a strong character with many good aspects we could relate too.Bottom line. It's pretty entertaining, and I took it out of my DVD player with a huge grin on my face, Can't beat that. You'll get your money's worth.7 ? 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having watched The Crazies i can safely say that the horror genre is not completely dead.First of all,this movie is a remake of George A.Romero's '73 cult classic.The movie's plot is simple;an airplane carrying a biological weapon named "Trixie" falls in the river of a small county on Iowa and all the residents are becoming psychopaths and trying to kill each other without a reason.The town's sheriff,his wife and the deputy are struggling to survive.Meanwhile the army is being "released" on the streets and the soldiers are shooting whatever moves without checking if one is infected or not...The movie has a fine pace,the acting is good and most importantly it has some great moments with my favorite being the one in the car wash,i personally did find it superb!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't seem original, but Eisner, Olyphant and Mitchell make it stand out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From an outside perspective, two counts of unoriginality can be charged to "The Crazies." One: it's a remake of a George Romero film from the '70s; Two: it adds another quarantined disease zombie movie to the pile that proliferated this past decade. Yet Breck Eisner's version does so many little things right. He keeps "The Crazies" suspenseful and elicits our sympathies for the main characters. Next to "28 Days Later," and its sequel as well as "I Am Legend," no zombie disease flick of late has done it better."The Crazies" does offer some unique trappings to the genre. The story takes place in the small Iowa town of Ogden Marsh where the Sheriff Dave Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) has had a few cases of people going catatonic and then becoming violent. He soon discovers that a plane has crash-landed in the marsh in a location that feeds into the town's water supply. But before he can do anything about it, the military invades Ogden Marsh and begins to quarantine the local citizens and killing anyone who doesn't comply.So in addition to fighting off unstably violent diseased people, Dutten must avoid contact with the military for fear of being killed or separated from his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell). Mitchell and Olyphant succeed as likable leads for a horror film. Olyphant ("Live Free or Die Hard") performs better in the take-charge sheriff role and MItchell, since her starring role in sci-fi/horror flick "Pitch Black," has always proved she has more of a knack for the frightened protagonist/heroine than the average actress.Although not abundantly scary, Eisner keeps the film suspenseful and ominous with patience and strong shot composition. Most noticeably, his "crazies" don't act like most zombies; they're quiet and almost methodical and you can tell that they're succumbing to some uncontrollable impulse. It makes you take them much more seriously as an audience rather than simply enjoy the gory fun. The "scary" scenes also flow naturally and keep you guessing rather than constantly delaying an inevitable "boo!" moment.When the truth about the government plane and the substance on board gets out, the originality of the "Crazies" story comes through. Suddenly Dave and Judy are out there fighting to survive against the man as much as some diseased lunatics. The film doesn't resonate much more beyond that, but unlike much of this sub-genre, nothing poor can be said about the filmmaking.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why o why doe we have to take those remakes. The big guys at the studio's know that the horror geeks are willing to watch every movie that is coming out even as it is bad. Here we have a remake of The Crazies by Romero from the seventies. The original had bad reviews and this one had it also, but there are two groups of people out there, the lovers and the haters. Luckily the acting by the three main leads (Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson), are really believable but the story failed a bit. It's okay in some parts and it is sometimes really suspenseful but it lacks on the horror side. I was never frightened, not even when the crazies came out. It isn't gory but the red stuff do flows. I mean, the scene at the hospital with the pitchfork, that could have been gory, and have a look, you see the fork going through a body, next shot, you see it still out of the upper part of the body, Suddenly the fork is much longer...The crazies were a bit of a been there seen it done factor. I guess many geeks will love it but for me it didn't worked out as i wanted to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy, but that's how it goes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If the 2010 remake of George A. Romero's "The Crazies" seems familiar, well, don't be surprised. The film concerns a small town that goes cuckoo for Cocoa Puffs after their water supply is tainted. The seemingly docile and irregular townsfolk suddenly have a thirst for blood and nothing can convince them otherwise, save for a blow from a shotgun. Things go from bad to worse when the military steps in, while a band of survivors and their troubled sheriff (Timothy Olyphany) try their very hardest to get out of dodge."The Crazies" smells of much of the post-apocalyptic fare we've been treated to over the past decade or so and unfortunately does very little to steer itself away from the genre's clichés. To say you'll see every jump scare and grisly death coming is an understatement; unless you're new to the genre, nothing in this film will take you by surprise. Having said that, though, the film does a good job of keeping a feverish pace from the get-go. Director Breck Eisner doesn't waste any time and the result is a film that is lean, mean and efficient in its purpose. The cast also helps amp up the energy as well, with the ever-reliable Timothy Olyphant stepping up to the plate with a performance that overcomes many of the script's flaws (flaws which concern crucial character development). Not only is the experience of following the sheriff and his crew on their mission a thrill, it's also driven home with a realistic human element which, in the end, saves the film from itself.All in all, while "The Crazies" doesn't bring anything new to the genre, it at least serves as an efficient roller-coaster ride of a horror-flick. The direction and the cinematography is top-notch with performances from Olyphant and company making the trip worthwhile. True, horror fans will find its script a bit stale and bland while fans of the Romero original will be left wondering why more wasn't done with this update. As it stands, "The Crazies" isn't the best remake to come along in recent memory, but it's certainly not the worst.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Am I paranoid or are you just unusually focused?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel bad labeling this a crappy horror movie, because it isn't really. It has no real dull patches or obviously bad bits, there are just too few good moments or scenes. This is actually a prime example of all the good moments being crammed into a trailer to make it look suspenseful and appealing, only when you see the film there is 95 minutes of padding around them.In the sleepy rural town of Ogden Marsh not much goes on.Mostly? It is opening day for the local baseball season and most of the town turns out to support the players, a local gent walks menacingly onto the outfield and towards the players, I say menacingly because he is carrying a big f*cking shotgun.The town sheriff David, played by Timothy Olyphant makes a snap decision and rushes onto the field to cut him off at the pass. After a brief but tense failed negotiation it is obvious that the man is not altogether feeling himself, and no he will not drop the gun, when he raises the barrel upwards? Kaplowee! In the aftermath of a big event in a small town it is widely assumed that the gent was drunk, this is quickly proved incorrect, leading David to second guess his actions with his wife, local Doc Judy, played by Rahda Mitchell, who tries to comfort him by telling him he did the right thing.So that's that then you might think? Of course not, that evening a patient of Judy's has his own Mel Gibson moment and burns down his own home, complete with his wife and kid inside. Instead of running away the man simply waits for everyone to show up while he watches the results of his actions. The affected all appear crystal clear and calm. They move deliberately but purposefully and don't say a great deal or make much noise.Initially that is? In the following days a body is found with a parachute strapped to him, the ensuing search leads David and his deputy Russell to a large plane submerged in the local river. After joining 2 and 2 together David approaches the mayor to suggest that the town shut off the water supply, as it is fed directly by the river. No dice says the mayor, but as it turns out it was too late anyway.David goes back to town to find the place seemingly deserted, to make matters worse communications to the outside world are also shut off. It also appears someone is watching. That "someone" is the army, they summarily round up everyone in the town and without explanation quarantine them, separating them into two distinct groups. David and Judy are separated and Judy is taken away, David and the rest are evacuated elsewhere. Being the good husband, and knowing he wouldn't hear the end of it if he didn't go get her, David goes back to find Judy and runs into Russell. Together they manage to locate Judy moments before she is given a righteous forking, and off they go.Once back in town it seems that society has gone to heck in a handbasket, the survivors they come across aren't the most sociable types, and other rednecks are getting their kicks by hunting people down and taking "trophies". If that don't just beat all the troops are still around picking up (off?) strays.So for the remainder of the film David, Judy and Russell - and a fluctuating number of traveling companions - set off through the town to escape whatever is happening.In such a stressful situation just to make matters worse none of them know if they or their buddies are infected, as the initial symptoms are reasonably innocent.So that of course understandably brings a certain level of paranoia: - Who is infected? - Who is just coughing? - Am I paranoid or are you just unusually focused? - Are you pointing that gun past me or at me? I've said it before, this isn't a bad flick, in many ways it reminded me of The Mist, a solid premise with a couple of OK scenes but nothing too memorable, but The Mist at least had a solid ending, The Crazies stumbles near the end, almost wondering how to wrap things up before meandering to a "meh" conclusion.So in honour of that? Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. It isn't really crappy, but too much of not enough can't be called Worthwhile. (I consider myself firm but fair.)If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Actually a really sane idea, to remake this Romero movie. Not because the original was bad (anything but), but because there is a new audience out there, who can enjoy this movie. Plus it has been done with much respect to the original and Romero overall. If you watch the special features on hand here, it is obvious that the makers and those involved in getting the movie made, have more than just Respect towards Romero and the movies he did (and does).Having said that, this stands on it's own two feet, which stands and falls with T. Olyphants performance. Which means, you might either love or hate it because of that. There are quite a few good ideas in there and nice touches. Though I still think that Carriers is way too underrated in that regard (of the basic idea/premise that drives this movie too).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A small town in infected and it is so small, no one really cares about it except for the people who live there. I guess you could say if something happened, the army could just wipe it out and cover it up with something else. The movie was decent but as for a horror film, it had a lot of problems. The cast was decent. It mostly focuses on a few people. Timothy Olyphant; who I thought was good, but really didn't fit his part. Then you have Radha Mitchell who seemed to fit the park, but was a little off on her acting. You also have Joe Anderson who I personally enjoyed the most. He had a lot of emotional changes in the film and it shows. The zombies in the film were not the typical brain eating ones. This was more of a virus that basically makes people angry and not able to think. It just makes them want to kill anything that is alive and in return when everything is dead, they die themselves. The army was suppose to use it on places of war, but oops, it fell on this small town. The way the infected looked was pretty cool looking. They were not really warped looking, but more just looked like they had a disease that destroyed their body from the inside out. The story of the film had promise but by the end did not deliver and with some strange bad CG scenes, it just made it worse. But for the most part, you can tell what they are getting at and it can be fun to watch once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pregnant Women in Peril Aren't My Idea of Crazy Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horror genre, not unlike comedy, is one that requires a delicate touch. There's a very fine line that separates fun and unpleasant when it comes to scary movies.I didn't enjoy "The Crazies," an amped-up remake of a 1970s George Romero film about the accidental release by the military of a biological weapon that causes people to go, as the title suggests, crazy. It's a grueling exercise, in which we watch the town sheriff and his pregnant wife struggle for their lives as they try to escape to safety. I have a pregnant wife at the moment as well as a 19-month old son, and so I had a lot of trouble telling myself this was just a movie.Speaking objectively, "The Crazies" is pretty well made, and while its two stars aren't exactly A-list (Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell), they're good enough to sell the material. But it's not an especially memorable movie, which I wouldn't have minded so much if I'd thought it was any fun.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheeseburger cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies is like a cheeseburger you get from a fast food franchise. It follows a particular formula to produce an experience that's exactly what you expect. There are no peppers or eggs or cream cheese mixed into this cinematic morsel so if you're looking for something new and different, you won't find it here. But if you're in the mood for a fairly basic, well executed example of the horror genre, The Crazies will hit the spot.The plot of this film is as simple as they come. The residents of the fictional Iowa town of Ogden Marsh start going violently insane and a small group of people have to find a way to survive both their murderous neighbors and the brutal efforts of the government to contain the situation. The mystery of why it's all happening is revealed fairly early on and the story only flirts with broader themes of morality and ethics the rest of the way. Mostly, The Crazies focuses tightly on its more-or-less heroic survivors making their way from one dangerous situation to another.Those survivors include the refreshingly square-jawed county sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his pregnant wife Judy (Rhada Mitchell) and his faithful deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson). Those three head up a cast that does some fairly decent acting in this movie. I mean, nobody's doing Shakespeare here, but these performers manage to give some human believability both to their deadly situation and to their interactions with each other.Director Breck Eisner also does a nice job with this film. Yes, he does rely a bit too much on having things jump out at people from off screen, but he largely avoids the cliché of shaky-cam and shows a pretty nice eye for compelling imagery. Eisner also demonstrates something you don't see enough of in this kind of horror flick; he brings a sense of restraint to the whole affair. Much of the genre today cranks the violence, gore and depravity up to such a high level and either burns itself out or devolves into self-parody. In doing so, they usually provoke a reaction of either disgust, laughter or boredom. Eisner avoids those pitfalls to produce some honest scares and thrills.The Crazies is also decently written, though I don't want to go overboard on that. The story does rely on a lot of coincidences and has a lot of plot holes. What it does do is give a little personality to its characters and effectively balance the various threats against them. By the standards of its genre, this is a good script but it's not going to blow anyway away with its wit or imagination.I should also point out that while a lot of critics seem to be calling The Crazies a "zombie film", that's not really true. The berserk townspeople of this movie do bear a surface resemblance to "the sprinting dead" of more recent spate of zombie flicks but that's all. This story is distinctly different from the zombie movie as created and defined by George A. Romero. Those films are internally focused on what the zombie presence does to people and their social order. The Crazies is more outwardly focused, like a natural disaster film. It's about people making extraordinary choices and sacrifices to overcome an external danger, not about them breaking down under the inescapable presence of death. This movie is a remake of a film Romero himself made back in the 1970s, so the critics' confusion is somewhat excused. But Romero's The Crazies was not the same thing as his zombie work and the makers of this movie understood that.Other than giving KCRG's Bruce Aune his big break in show business, there's nothing exceptional about this film. It's just a competently made, reasonably effective horror movie. If you enjoy that sort of thing, you should definitely see it.</fullReview>

Not too original - I know it's a remake but having not seen the original, I thought this version was like any other zombie movie anyway, albeit with a touch of sci-fi. It was also more action than horror, which was fine, since the action was good. I wish the movie had been tightened up more - 11 minutes off its 101-minute run would've made the pacing much better - but the extra time was used in character development and since leads Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell pulled off their roles well, I didn't mind it too much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's just not my cup of tea.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is a remake of the 1973 film originally directed by the legendary George A. Romero. Many people have called the film one of the best recent horror remakes, but I say not quite. I didn't like it, but I didn't hate it either.In Iowa, a sheriff named Dave Dutton (Played by Timothy Olyphant) and his deputy Russell (Played by Joe Anderson) are investigating a strange epidemic of people slipping into deep catatonic states of violence, that quickly rises into a problem of national security. The two of them, along with Dave pregnant wife Judy (Played by Radha Mitchell), and her hospital assistant Becca (Played by Danielle Panabaker) try to escape not only the military who threaten to exterminate them, possibly to the point of blowing them to kingdom come, but also the violent and hypnotized "Crazies." This simply makes for a pretty interesting premise, and matched with the atmosphere of the film is definitely attention grabbing, but the movie doesn't reach its full potential, and is not entirely successful. The story can feel a little rushed at times, and this is nothing to say of the dialogue, which is occasionally cringe worthy.As for the actors, It's got some good talent. The four central characters are pretty good in moving the movie along, but some don't feel entirely satisfying. And the movie did leave quite a bit up to interpretation. I'm not against movies with open ends, but this seemed a little too unexplained to me.However, I will give the film kudos for one of the more inspired choices. Opting to use intense psychological terror, rather than try to scare with cheap, and far too easy methods like typical Horror film "Jump moments." The movie isn't entirely without those, but the way it's severely toned down makes for some much more authentic, and much more unsettling fear.All in all though, I give The Crazies ** out of **** But don't let my review discourage you from seeing it. It's probably because the movie wasn't my particular cup of tea, and it was just shy of a two and a half star rating. If you're looking for a fast paced, and psychologically frightening horror, you may want to check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That Is Much Improved Over the Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A virus (Code Name: Trixie) is unleashed in the small town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa. It turns people into zombie-like creatures, and they must be quarantined. Of course this is a logistical problem: how do you quarantine a whole town, and if you're inside, how do you get out? I saw the original several years ago on a bad VHS copy. Maybe it was the VHS and a good, clean transfer would be better, but I would the movie hard to watch and really poorly done. And, you know, George Romero is hit and miss. He's a legend, but he's not flawless.I love this newer version. The story is still nothing new... another twist on the "Return of the Living Dead" and similar zombie films (though these people are not technically zombies). But it's better than the old one. Coming from a director who is pretty much known only for "Sahara" (which I think bombed) I was impressed.I really appreciated the low use of CGI and the generally unknown actors. That added to the small town feel that these people were normal, and there was no "hero" that stood out. There were some creepy moments, some jumps, and I really thought this worked well. I own the film and will gladly watch it again and again.</fullReview>

There are very few, almost no remakes that top the original films, most remakes are done strictly for profit by greedy studio heads, who only want the moviegoers money &amp; not once cares if the script is any good, or if it respects it's originals source material, there have been exceptions however, THE HILLS HAVE EYES 06', MY BLOODY VALENTINE 3D, all topped their originals, THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE 03', DAWN OF THE DEAD 04' although coming very close to topping their originals, did fall slightly short, but were very good scary &amp; entertaining movies regardless, you can see where the love was in making these movies &amp; that the writers &amp; studios really cared for the projects &amp; the fans &amp; were determined to give them the best movie they could, thankfully THE CRAZIES is one of them, the film is way better than Romero's film, it moves faster, has better special effects, tons more stunts &amp; explosions, some decent gore sprinkled here &amp; there &amp; better acting &amp; directing. What I liked best about THE CRAZIES 10' is that it never slows done &amp; hits you with a bang right from the beginning, rather than boring it's audience &amp; ends with a bang, never once losing sight of it's story, with it's many scares &amp; plot twists carefully timed at certain intervals to keep the viewer on the edge of their seat. Highly recommended to horror fans don't miss it.***1/2 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Thoroughly gripping, extremely fast-paced anti-government zombie thriller roller-coaster ride.At least, a horror movie which isn't totally stupid and features some well-rounded, well-acted characters and eerily effective set-pieces. Of course, there's nothing highly original about the proceedings, but the shocks and gory moments come fast... so there's no time to realize the weak spots. And the Crazies are refreshingly brainy compared to their other zombie colleagues.The last half hour feels slightly redundant, but all in all this one's the best zombie pic in years.7 out of 10 bloody pitchforks</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The CraziesJust because you live in a small town doesn't mean that you're crazy. It just means that your blue ribbon heifer is mostly likely your next of kin.And while the townsfolk in this horror movie aren't blood relatives with barnyard beasts, something in their blood is making them completely loco.When an army aircraft carrying a mysterious bio-chemical crash lands in the main water supply of a rural Iowa township, the once peaceful residents pickup arms and begin murdering each other. With the odds stack against them, sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his wife (Radha Mitchell) and his deputy (Joe Anderson) fight for survival, not only against the infected populace but also the US soldiers and scientists trying to contain the region. In doing so, sheriff Dutton uncovers a massive conspiracy with far reaching implications.A remake of the 1973 classic directed by George A. Romero, this updated version constructs a more believable and timely narrative; however, in this interpretation the "crazies" are slightly tamer than their predecessor. Not only that, but it has a tendency to wallow in redundancy and clichés.Besides, contaminating an entire rural population's water supply is futile, since they only drink turpentine and never bathe.

		<shortDescription>A cross between a Romero zombie classic and the Romero "Crazies" original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies (2010)A surprise quasi-vampire film, but then it shouldn't have been surprising because it was produced by George Romero, the father and mother of contemporary zombie films. The villains here are not actually zombies but people infected with a bio-warfare disease that makes them murderous. And ugly. That might sound familiar, and in fact, this is a remake of a Romero original, from 1973, a low-budget, not-classic film set in Pennsylvania. The effects here are updated, and the weaponry, and frankly the convincingness, which matters a lot, though in the end there is something about doing it first that matters, too. Echoes of the original, and of lots of real zombie movies, haunt this one.The heroes are few and embattled. The scenario happens out in corn country, near Cedar Rapids, Iowa. The events, step by step, follow a well worn progression, from innocence and denial to suspicions to small fears to large fears to apocalypse and desperation. And eventually, according to the rules, to survival, except that if you know the lodestone classic in this genre, "Night of the Living Dead," there are no rules about how these things end.But it's well done all the way. The leading sheriff and his wife the town doctor are a bit too stereotypically handsome and blonde, but they are tough under their gentle midwest skin, and they do a solid job making their roles believable. This isn't easy when everyone around is kidnapped, killed, dying, dead, or chasing them with knifes and guns in their hands. In a way, the various obstacles to surviving are predictable, but they are created with startling credibility, at least in the larger cases. I don't want to give away one major surprise half an hour into it, but when the first round of intruders arrives it's a shock and the next twenty minutes is a nightmare of a really chilling and reasonable (and unreasonable) kind. For me that was the highlight of the film, and it's main strength. The original "The Crazies" was mostly about this other aspect, the government control and conspiracy, and that's probably a good 1973 preoccupation. This 2010 version focuses more on individual survival. The original had almost no sense of fighting other victims, zombie style, the way this one does, and in a way, that is a stronger and more chilling premise. This current versions is so much better made though, top notch production values, it will hold you just in visceral terms.By the final third you will not stop watching, but you can tell the writers had run out of original twists, and some common tricks get used and re-used. The main one, of course, is having one or our stars wander into a dark location and suddenly we know (and they don't know) there is a bad guy in the room. Necessary for suspense, perhaps, but been there done that a lot before. Even in this movie.If you like this kind of movie you'll totally like this one. Kept me glued.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-done but too slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A plane has crash-landed in a lake that provides the drinking water of a small mid Western town. Suddenly people start acting crazy and become homicidal maniacs. Sheriff Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) tries to keep things in order--but then the government shows up and takes over and starts to quarantine people. Dutton escape with his wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and deputy (Joe Anderson) but slowly discovers that things are much worse than he imagined.Well-done movie starts off quickly but then slows down to a crawl. If you've seen the original by George Romero you pretty much know the plot and this doesn't add too much to it...except more explicit gore and a bigger budget. The last 2/3rds of the movie is just Olyphany, Mitchell and Anderson walking away, meeting crazies, killing them, walking some more, meeting MORE crazies...etc etc etc. It gets dull quick. VERY good acting by the three leads help...but only to a point. It all leads to an ending which somewhat negates the whole movie! Not a total bomb but too slow to really work. I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romero redone right: The Midwest Cuckoos...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though originally conceived in the era of the U$-Russian Third World war in Vietnam, THE CRAZIES is still timely after all this time (unfortunately); in this era of "monkey see, monkey do" murder sprees in schools and still more Third World wars (not to mention- though I will- video games that help engender violence in our society by reducing to mere stats the targets of "shooter games"), Romero's cautionary tale still carries weight. Done with an economy of motion (and Emotion), this tale of the 'flicted (that's "afflicted" to you Northern Invaders) is even more closely focused on the VICTIMS of the rabies-plus virus than the original (which dwelt- with some wit- on the ineffectual response(s) of the members of the Military-Industrial-Religious Complex). It's hard not to enjoy the Doomsday Scenario as delineated by Romero (Then or Now), especially when the repressed emotions of the infected are given full sway. The action is amped up in this re-do, which is in itself incredible (the First Version featured a little old lady using a gas-masked soldier as a pin cushion), though the slowly escalating paranoia among the survivors takes a while to settle in- which it does, in an interesting turn (I thought). The desolate vistas (which call to mind the expansive western plains in BAD COMPANY, with Jeff Bridges) contrast nicely with the claustrophobic settings in the original and the wide open spaces prove even more dangerous (a la, the "crop dusting" scene in Alfred Hitchcock's NORTH BY NORTHWEST). As with John Carpenter's version of THE THING, the paranoia is almost palpable in THE CRAZIES and it likewise proves an exception to the rule that remakes must suck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is just bad. There's no way around it. The plot is unbelievably predictable: a polluted water supply turns everyone crazy, the classic idiot military comes in to make a big mess of everything, there are some cliché zombie fight scenes, and the main characters walk away unharmed in the end. Some of the scenes were so cheesy and hilarious that they had my entire family in stitches. There was a big chunk in the middle that was quite badly written and I had no idea what was happening or where the characters were.But that being said, The Crazies is really no worse than most horror movies. It's rare to come across a movie in this genre that isn't totally ridiculous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Less ceremonious visuals and less dull jump scares while more style and charisma make this movie somewhat more then your average zombie flick. On the other hand I found the script (maybe in the attempt to be original) a bit inconsistent. The biggest problem is, that it doesn't actually ever reach a real climax, instead gets a bit draggy around the last third. Without dissecting the movie, I also missed a bit of tension, thrill. These "crazies" never really got to me. So all together, it doesn't have highs and neither real lows, it's just a rather okay movie - mainly because of a classy performance by Radha Mitchell.6/10 but not for hardcore fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you need your Romero Fix, then go see this movie. Me and a handful of movie buffs went to the cinema today to see this "Splatter Movie", and none of us, I think, went out completely sane. It was a hit, we all bought the premise, and we all knew that this was not going to be art like Von Trier or Scorcese, this is a genre that don't need to change. It is the delivery that counts. And a good cast delivers us a great fun ride with all of the before seen storyline, action, humor and gore. No surprises is it's only weakness! Few and easily forgiven faults. Don't go expecting to see the best movie ever, don't go for the effects, and don't go if you don't like horror.But if you can check on all of the above you should have a good time whether you watch it in the cinema or on video,, or DVD as it's called these days.

		<shortDescription>A distinguished type of craziness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll be honest with you - I'm one of the people unknown to Romero's brainchild that served as the basis for this modern remake. I'm not the biggest horror buff - I just like watching a good movie every so now and then...and a good horror movie with my mates. Snyder's Dawn of the Dead remake has already achieved a sort of 'cult status' amongst me and my peers - there's just something about Ving Rhames' role in there that makes it worth watching again and again. People may not see it as a top-notch movie, but then again, it doesn't need to be. Most zombie films are just perfect brainless entertainment for a night with the boys.Going into The Crazies I didn't really know what to expect - the story seemed pretty standard. A breakout in a small town, attempted containment, people lose their minds, small group of survivors...been there, done that. I think it's safe to say my expectations weren't really that high. 'Just lay it on me', I thought as the movie began.What I got, surprisingly or not, exceeded my expectations. Although I don't think this remake surpasses the brilliance of the intelligent, small budget horror of 28 Days Later, it certainly rises to the same level. The tension is as omnipresent as it is relentless - there's never a dull moment (and every time you think there is, malice seems just around the corner). The zombies in this film work their magic by not actually appearing en-masse on screen - what Eisner has beautifully done is to take advantage of the simple fear of the unknown. You fear what you cannot see, and that's also how it is in The Crazies. Many scenes try to conceal the present evil in one way or another, and you don't see masses of zombies as you would in aforementioned DOTD remake. After the breakout, you mostly see them only half, or for brief moments (save one or two scenes). Add a sprinkle of black humor, and it seems to do the trick.Granted, it may not be as fun to watch with a group of drunken friends as the rest of the zombie arsenal out there, but it may perfectly well serve as a proper 'starter' for when everyone is still sober. Go and see this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Do you find life uninteresting ? Is it not disturbing ? Then come to Pierce County, Ogden Marsh, Iowa. Home to the wrecked aircraft carrying Bio-germ warfare, slated for eradication ,that didn't make it to its final destination. Now, time is running out on the inhabitants of this quaint little American town, if the virus doesn't get you, the Federal Government will ! The Feds well aware of the airplane accident, troops in the Military to control, let's face it, extinguish the residents and contain the situation. Sheriff David Dutton(Timothy Olyphant) faces an increasingly unpleasant situation, the townspeople are suffering from some kind of disorder where they start committing senseless violent acts. As he tries to track down the cause, the US. Military is sent in to round-up the people , separate them, and quarantine the two groups, crazy and less crazy(not affected).People running a fever are segregated and slated for extinction, hah..ha..including the Sheriff and Dr. wife, Judy(Rhada Mitchell).From the opening scene at the ball field, to the ending, we are taken into the bizarre situation, and forced to make disturbing and life altering decisions. Director Breck Eisner does a really nice job of selling the dilemma. He has a short list of directorial credits(Sahara), upcoming (Flash Gordon) and (The Brood).What makes this film work is the unknown. You are given about as much information as the characters, and are allowed to experience what they choose, and you are left wondering about the consequences. Life is no longer a slam dunk, life is falling into shades of gray, and around every corner lies the difference between life and death. Excellent ! While some people criticize the film for not having allot of scary moments, this film delivers on a more subtle level, tense and scary, but not overwhelming bloody or allot of jump cuts done purely for shock value. I gave this film an 8. Good performances by the lead actors, who keep you engaged. Stay through the first closing credits to see a news alert, that gives you in a little more info.More of a mind screw, and who can't use a little screwing...?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it is SO freaking annoying to hear people consider this movie to be about zombies when there isn't a single hint or look at zombies. But still, this movie was fantastic and thrilling in nearly every way! Timothy Olyphant was perfect as Sheriff David Dutton, the main character. Radha Mitchell wasn't the perfect actress to play the sheriff's wife Judy Dutton, but she still pulled it off. And then there's Joe Anderson, who plays David's deputy Russell. He did so well with his character that you felt more sorry for him than anyone else in the movie, even more sorry than David and Judy. But the one thing that is annoying as hell is people calling "the crazies", zombies. They aren't freaking zombies! They still think, they react, and they know what they are doing! You even see this when David and Judy get attacked in their home and the mother and the son of someone David had to put down at the beginning of the movie, the mother tells the son that David is the man that "murdered your father." So STOP calling this a zombie movie and GET OVER IT. Phenomenal film, I'd watch it over and over again. It's worth buying and owning. Don't miss this gem.9/10 Stars</fullReview>

If you enjoy this type of movies - you won't be disappointed, this movie delivers from all perspectives - good actors, very very well played, great pace, gore and yeah - more GORE, last but not least - pressure builds up all the all way through the movie to reach an absolute beautiful ending..The genre has seen some titles lately, including Romero's other new installment - Survival Of The Dead, but I feel this as the best and certainly delivered the most of everything. Some people compare to "28 days later", which was by all means a great move, but one must not forget, Romero created the genre, he's not competing, he's in a class of his own. And this movie proves it once more.So basically - if you like the typical virus outbreak / zombie scenario - you're surely gonna love this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best film yet about the Tea Bagger movement... but it has its faults</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a non-American, I can only see this film as a parable of the Republican Creed of Greed that has already infected that large part of the American population called the Tea Baggers and turned them into potential heartless and mindless home-grown gun-toting terrorists. It is also evocative of giant man-made disasters like the BP Gulf oil spill.I found the film inspiring in that it shows an America that is still powerful, wealthy and efficient enough to actually pull a valid (though extremely brutal) containment strategy in a time of crisis.Believing this allowed me to sit through this very efficient display of gore tainted with suspense without actually losing my mind.Unfortunately, this film has many faults. They are not in the writing, the acting, the editing or the direction, which are all excellent. They have to do with the slavish imitation of the movie zeitgeist in such details as cinematography and music."The Crazies" is the 788th straight film in a row of the past decade that is shot in a kind of icy, livid, washed-up blue-green digitally degraded hue that is very hard to correct even on the best TV monitor. I tried upping the colour level, deepening the blacks, blooming the whites and increasing the contrast but it still stays a depressing Manganese Blue and Pond Scum Green nightmare. One way to get through this ordeal is turning the colour off altogether and watching it in black and white. One can also hope that, say, in ten years time, when this blue-green fad will have gone the way of the nose ring and the vuvuzela, distributors are going to implement a re-colourization program that will make the best of those films watchable again. As for the music, it is the usual noise + sound effects + percussion + mind-altering low frequency hums mix that is the trademark of every horror film of the past ten years and is the continuous soundtrack of the fear-mongering History Channel documentaries. It is technically known, for now, as "fear music", and to be fair, composer Mark Isham is one of the creators of that new genre of non-music. This too shall pass, if music education does not disappear from American schools altogether, which is a very iffy proposition at this time, given the state of the US education system.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I haven't seen the the original, nor do I want to watch it since it was made in the 70's with horrible production budget, but I wasn't too crazy about seeing this movie when it did come out either. However, I completely underestimated it. I finally got to watch it and although the plot is somewhat similar to that of 28 weeks later, it's a whole different movie on its own.I liked it because of the realistic portrayal of the HAZMAT teams and military taking care of business, so to speak. Whatever the military were ordered to do here is actually standard protocol in real life. So, in the even of a situation like this happening in real life, these measures would be taken. And why not, with such a small town of just nearly 2000 people? The contractors and whoever is giving the orders sees past the morality issue here, as long as they can contain it without spreading, then those extreme measures must be taken.The movie is great because it also reminds of me Outbreak with Dustin Hoffman and Donald Sutherland, which had the military bombing towns to make sure the virus is obliterated because of its airborne characteristics.Tim Olyphant is a great actor and so is his female co-star who was amazing in the Silent Hill adaptation movie. The story is about a small town that gets infected by a disease that renders peoples mental state, "crazy". No thanks to government who manufactured it. This is actually a conspiracy theorists wet dream.Anyways, some of the towns people get infected, they start killing anyone who isn't infected and the army comes in with their biological squad units to see if they can quarantine the people, some residents or infected residents decide to take matters into their own hands and cause havoc on the established medical camp the military has set up which in turn makes the military flee back for more updated orders.The military come back to finish off every single resident of that town, including ones who escaped to nearby gas stations, hotels, and places of shelter. The survivors somehow find a way to get past them without getting killed, but when they try to escape with a truck to a city called "Cedar Point", the military decides to really finish off their original small town with a mini-nuke. The shock-wave from the nuke reaches the 18 wheeler and spins it on its back. The two main survivors still live, and walk their way to Cedar Point.As they walk, they are continuously watched by a satellite view, just like in the beginning and the new orders are to contaminate Cedar Point since they assume the survivors already have contracted the disease from previous endeavours.The movie ends on that note, and after a bit of credits a news report comes on confirming that the next huge cloud of smoke is an accidental fire, but we all know it's the nuke that wiped out the small town.That's what I love about it, the seriousness of the situation the survivors are faced with. But try to not be too surprised by the actions of the military as they are following orders from someone they know nothing about and they're just as expandable as the civilians. This is standard protocol, so at least when this happens to any of us, it will be a quick death. Though, quarantines are ALWAYS the first step, and if nothing can be done to get rid of the infection and cure it, then the government will have no choice but to take quick measures and kill everyone, and evaporate the town off the map so that the airborne infection or any infection can be dealt with in one single blow. That way it doesn't spread nationwide, or worldwide and the media can make up a story for the deaths of however many people die.The only question you can ask is why are people sick enough in their mind to manufacture a disease and test a town or city of people as guinea pigs. It's the higher ups you have to blame, not the military.All in all, excellent movie, watch this and forget the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When people think of the Horror genre, people don't automatically think masterpieces or award winners. In fact, a lot of people tend to disapprove in the violent films and dismay every time someone is ripped into bloody pieces on screen. This being said, as a fan of Horror, one expects as much originality as you do with classic films. In recent years, however, once one film produces a stand out concept the trend is to repeat, remake and remodel until we are truly bored. The Crazies , a remake of a 1979 film of the same name, is unfortunately a film that has caught this plague. In The Crazies, a virus contaminates the water supply of small town Ogden Marsh turning nearly all the residents, well, crazy. As the folk of Ogden Marsh slowly turn into blood hungry killing machines, the Sheriff David Dutton and his gun wheedling deputy Russell Clank must fight to survive not just the "Crazies" but the Army who will contain the virus by any means possible. Dutton has no choice but to try to save his life, save his wife, and save his town. The premise of The Crazies had a lot of potential. Instead of turning people into brain eating zombies, this virus turns them into psychopathic murderers that then eventually die. However, this tiny scrap of originality does not make up for the overall lack of surprise. The format is practically the same as any other virus movie and within 5 minutes of watching the film, it is not hard to know who is going die, survive and what is going to happen next. Unfortunately, being able to correctly predict the storyline (and maybe some of the script too) makes it hard to feel excited. Alas, by the end you are wallowing in tedium and not suspense. The characters are underdeveloped too and instead of focusing on making them 3-Dimensional, the writers opt to kick start to drama far too early in the film. This means an hour and a half of watching characters you couldn't care less about trying to fight for their lives. To make this worse, as though to distract us from the poor plot, the Director, Breck Eisner, resorts to confusing camera shots and shocks to keep us hooked resulting in many muddled scenes. Eisner's attempt at artistic shots from unusual points of view ends in a visual feast that is nothing but a nauseous take-away you may regret later. And upon leaving the cinema, you can feel just like that; the sense of wasting money on a film that you probably could have written yourself. This being said the film does scare you which I suppose on some levels is the point. The film has a good knack for building up the right amount of tension to terrify you witless when something leaps at the screen. If you are looking for that kind of thrill without a complicated plot then The Crazies is just for you. Overall, The Crazies is no Oscar winner and that's OK but for a struggling genre all the audience craves is more originality. Perhaps if they left the original alone it would have that fresher feel to it. In the end, it is a predictable film trying to shock, scare and surprise you but instead leaves you with a boredom that would drive anyone crazy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this movie well enough. For a remake it's better than most. If you have watched as many horror films as I have don't go in expecting to be surprised. Many shots are so predictable you wont even jump.If you like splat gore horror, it's got some blood, plenty of bodies, and a few good "crazy" moments.If you like true horror, you'll find yourself wanting. The crazies do seem to posses intelligence and the premeditated rigorous attention to detail of a Hannibal Lecter movie, but lack the same punch. There are a couple shots with good crazy attacks with planning.For the most part the movie is trying to appease both sides but it uses they same techniques to inspire shock and awe as all other horror movies today. This means lots of orchestra hits to announce something scary is happening.The film works well though, it could have been better, but it's better than others. If you have someone special who is easily frightened this might be a movie to take her/him to and then sneak off halfway to come off as all concerned for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was actually a pretty decent film, but maybe that is cause I had low expectations for this. There is also a lot of those cliché pop up jump scares scares, but they are actually effected most of the times in this one. Plus the people that gets infected and acts like zombies was a bit more frightening cause they are somewhat smart compared to zombies in other flicks. I live in Texas so I can relate with some of these southern characters, so it was like these was actually happening in my hometown except a bit more south. I also enjoyed the element of how everyone loses trust with each other because of the infection and turn on each other. The zombie like beings are scary at times, but what was more intimidating was the soldiers trying to eradicate every civilian near the area in order to stop the infection from spreading elsewhere. There is more positive to this than negative.7.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistent, tense horror...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the original film and lacking in sufficient background knowledge in order to know what to expect from 'The Crazies', I was most surprised to discover that it is a relentlessly tense feature, benefiting from clever direction and realistic characters portrayed by a talented cast that take to their roles seriously.Telling the story of a town overwhelmed by mayhem following the contamination of their water supply, 'The Crazies' rises above typical genre fare with consistently fresh scenarios throughout its running time, gradually unfolding the story for the group of survivors to piece together along with the audience, adding an element of mystery to the proceedings. Gruesome and shocking, the action is well paced and insightful character development makes for a welcome break between each set piece; the producers appear to acknowledge that their movie is a slasher film to an extent and don't deny the viewer any horror, yet for those who have grown tired of wafer thin characters in this genre, the movie definitely caters for them.The opening of 'The Crazies' left me feeling somewhat disturbed, wondering if this was a film I would ever be willing to watch again. Having seen (and squirmed) it through, the quality of the overall product has changed my mind.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have a thing for Zombies at the moment spurned on by the Walking Dead Compendium i bought and read.I have decided that I will consume all Zombie in book, comic or film. So the release in the UK of The Crazies was an easy start.Me and my soon to be blog collaborator Stuart and Toria spent last Saturday afternoon in the Cinema in Cambridge watching it. Oddly enough to have another little dig it doesn't matter what film i see at the moment some little xxxxing chav wants to talk all the way through. To make it worse they were there as they had free tickets from doing a Chlamydia test. I kid you not. The film kicks off straight away. And doesn't slow down. What is good about the film is the pacing though....it doesn't seem to slow down but unlike a lot of "popcorn" flicks it doesn't just throw set piece after set piece. It all seems very realistic and believable. The story is not very original at all. Government error leads to poisoning of town which starts by sending people into homicidal frenzies before they turn into Zombies. Timothy Olyphant as the town Sheriff and his loyal Deputy have to get out of the town as the Government containment protocol kicks in. And the Army will stop at nothing to contain this.There are enough scares and tension to grip your stomach a little bit but not enough to spoil the story and the leads handle it well. I spent all night trying to remember where the lead actress was from. I was sure it was Neighbours (An Australian soap) but my mate said Pitch Black. Both of us were right. So i do recommend The Crazies as a fun film to go see. Its not dumb but not pretentious and trying to be clever and its well acted with enough likable and unlikeable characters and scarescheck out my blog www.inanegeek.com for any comic, film, TV and sports thoughts</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Breck Eisner and written by Scott Kosar &amp; Ray Wright, The Crazies (2010) is a remake of the 1973 film directed by George A. Romero. It stars Timothy Olyphant, Rhada Mitchell and Joe Anderson. The plot sees a toxic spill into a small American town's water system turn some of the locals into marauding maniacs.Eisner's movie is that rare old thing these days, that of the horror remake that greatly improves on the original. That might annoy some Romero purists, but the truth is is that his original film really isn't that great to begin with. Thus it's ripe for a remake, whilst acknowledging that a certain weariness creeps in to our thoughts at the seemingly never ending line of horror remakes churned out by a Hollywood running out of ideas. Hell I will even venture that we have seen all this before, nothing in this Crazies will have the horror faithful rushing out to tell their buddies about some overtly cranial splendour piece they have just watched. But this is a very effective horror piece, taut and tense at times, at others sick and splendidly disgusting. Eisner may not be a Craven, or for sure no Romero, but he executes the material with gusto and shows a knack for knowing how to make the material work.The film is structured over three parts - - character formations in the little town of the delightfully small Americana sounding Ogden Marsh, which leads into the infected going doolally-the army attempting to get things under control-and then the fall out as our brave survivors, erm, try to survive and make sense of what is happening. Eisner and his writers even get away with not fleshing out the principal characters. We know Olyphant's Sheriff is a toughie, and that his pregnant wife, Mitchell, is equally resourceful, while the deputy played by the film's standout performer, Joe Anderson, we know is loyal and sharp with a rifle. Who cares about flesh on these bones, let the crazies after them and see how they cope! Where the writers score good points is with the portrait of a world losing its humanity. The sick are rounded up and contained, nobody cares enough to try and help them, while those sent to restore order, to protect the people, are as dangerous as those bleeding from the eyes and ears. Madness everywhere.With memorable blood pumping scenes, bona fide suspense and metaphorical smarts in the writing, this is one damn fine remake shocker. 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A crazy fear of dying and isolation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story briefly? A small town is suddenly plagued by insanity after a toxin contaminates their water supply.I'm a George Romero fan, but I didn't enjoy the 1973 cult classic as much as his zombie films or this version. It's very rare I salute remakes, especially needless ones. However, The Crazies is an exception to the rule. Breck Eisner direction is effective and the writing is excellent, stopping it falling into b-movie territory. My only negative remarks are that there were too many 'getting saved at the last second moments' and an unnecessary CGI driven ending.The film plays on fear of dying and isolation. There's lots of gore, tension and atmosphere. Radha Mitchell and the underrated Timothy Olyphant are excellent as they convincingly fight for survival against the town folk that have turned crazy. Joe Anderson deserves a mention as the deputy.If you like 28 days later, you love this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a solid retelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original Crazies by George Romero was what should be called a "drive-in classic". Meaning it's not the kind of high art that should be reserved for other Romero films like Dawn of the Dead or Martin. This is a slam-bang action picture with a sharp political twist. Some of it is rough as a film, but it works more often than not. The director of this remake/re-imagining respects the integrity of Romero's message, but makes a film here that is solid on its own terms. It's a more than competently made "zombie" movie, though more like an infected-victim case where a toxin is released on a public in a small Iowa town, and the horror ensues when the few people who haven't become infected (either you do or you don't) have to escape the blockade put up by the military.It's as simple as that really, though along the way, as in any decent 'zombie' movie, our characters are just sharply drawn enough to know where they are at in an evolving sense in the story. This doesn't mean they stay exactly the same, nor do they change too radically one scene to another. One of the creative things Eisner does in his Crazies, as opposed to Romero's film, is to focus entirely on those trying to survive and escape, in this case a Sheriff, his wife, and his deputy, plus another girl. The deputy character, played by Joe Anderson (an actor to watch for sure), starts out like a capable bad-ass sidekick, a guy who can take out a nasty with his rifle and be able to keep his head. But at some point he just starts to lose it - maybe it's the sense of doom, or that he may just be getting sick- and it creates a lot of tension between the characters. It's also always believable because Eisner doesn't play it for laughs: this is, akin to Romero, who also executive produces, a serious, bloody horror movie.It doesn't mean every step is successful, or that the script shows the military as anything except ruthless and (mostly) faceless. Which is fine, since it gives a striking message in our current world, of how a military would go at a quarantine of an entire town (chaos ensues of course), and it also gives a strong parallel to the message of Romero's film, which was an Vietnam allegory. But certain moments are really shocking, even if we feel like we've seen them before. And there's one sequence particularly that is something of a mini-masterwork of suspense and horror. Often Eisner's The Crazies will try to shock with the JUMP scare (you know the kind, the cat lacking here thank goodness), and it more or less is passable. But at a scene where the characters hide from the military helicopter in a car-wash... and then the car-wash starts, and the Crazies come out of the wash and bubbles and machinery to go after our heroes, is harrowing. That, plus how the scene is resolved, in a very sharp one-TWO curve from laugh to total shock, is extraordinary.If the film has more moments like that it would be the smash horror film of the year. As it stands it's mostly just a good genre pic, respectful of the source, with a few individual touches. It can hold its own with the Zack Snyder Dawn of the Dead, for example.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie isn't bad but it's nothing ground breaking. It's worth going to the movies to watch but don't expect anything revolutionary in "The Crazies".Though there was an abundance of close call moments in this movie, after a while they began to become predictable. This movie was also kinda unnecessarily drawn out.I've noticed the different styles horror moves are using these days.There is the gore, guts and savage violence style eg. Hostel and the Saw series. Then there is the spook you out, ghost/paranormal style eg Exorcist, Exorcism of Emily Rose, The Fourth Kind. And finally there is the "made you flinch" style eg. Final Destination series. The Crazies fits in with the "made you flinch" style.</fullReview>

It started rubbish, the middle bit was rubbish and the end was even more rubbish (if that's possible). The acting was trite, the script was written on the back of a beer-mat. And the plot had more holes than a bit of foam. Basically I was left wondering "why?" for most of this lame duck. And on a technical note. I understand Americans are really great, but, do they really expect to survive a crash when the vehicle rolls several times and they aren't wearing a seat belt? Cause if that is the case, maybe all those Nascar drivers should get rid of their helmets and safety harnesses and just handle the roll-overs in their boxer shorts.As I said, rubbish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crazy film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake that's actually better than the original, (it took a lot to write that) and for anyone who hasn't seen George A Romero's original, you'll come from the cinema feeling very satisfied indeed. Of course, Romero's 1973 original is the inspiration for this tongue-in-cheek horror remake, but it scores on so many levels.With efficient and classic genre thrills, the plot slowly evolves into a somewhat satisfying thrill ride of action, blood, and shocks - lots and lots of shocks, which may not actually shock people anymore because they know what's coming. OK, this is unfortunately the case, and some parts are as predictable as your average horror flick.Like most horror movies, the film relies on the ability to turn from one tense moment to the other, and director Breck Eisner concentrates mainly on the entertainment value, allowing his actors to have some fun. It may not be as crazy and mad as the original, but isn't that the point in remakes, to be slightly different? Very well produced, with a sturdy cast and director, The Crazies is easily the best remake of the last few years.Yes, we may have seen it all before, but Eisner has outdone himself here, and is easily his best work, and a film that all horror remakes should take note of. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid 21st century version of the George A. Romero tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 2010 version of Romero's "The Crazies" may not offer its audience material that they haven't seen before, but the good news is that it also rarely gives them a chance to breathe, delivering quite a bit of action and becoming genuinely exciting at times. The story, for the uninitiated, deals with a biological weapon that infects the water supply of a small town named Ogden Marsh, and drives most of the locals insane with homicidal rage. Low key sheriff David (Timothy Olyphant) and his doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) hook up with other survivors to try to make their way to safety, while the military swoops in to try to contain the situation and this little section of the country turns into Hell on Earth. If you've seen movies such as the original "The Crazies", or Cronenberg's "Rabid", or Hollywood fare like "Outbreak", you pretty much know what to expect, but the characters are likable and their situation believable. What director Breck Eisner and company do is sweep the viewer along with the characters as they portray an event that basically snowballs way out of control. It begins quietly, as these things so often do, with a farmer interrupting a local ball game by walking onto the field with gun in hand. Some fine and chilling moments are created as the filmmakers show their willingness to treat most of their characters as fair game. Of course, there are also some fun gore moments, such as David managing to make use of a knife that's actually been rammed through his hand. All makeup and visual effects and stunts are well done, but what really drives the movie is the way that it shows the toll taken on our main characters. Romero's film showed the perspectives of both the protagonists and the military men in charge, while this film basically focuses on one group. Olyphant and the radiant Mitchell are fine as always, heading up a cast that also features Joe Anderson as Olyphants' deputy, Danielle Panabaker as a local gal, and character players such as John Aylward, Glenn Morshower, Larry Cedar, and Gregory Sporleder. Be sure to look for the cameo by original "Crazies" actress Lynn Lowry, as a lady on a bicycle; the only thing is that she doesn't get a close-up so that we know that it's her. Still, it's a nice touch, as it so often is when actors from an original appear in a remake, and the film moves along so well that it doesn't seem as long as it is. In the end, this is an entertaining film if not an innovative one, and that's what really matters, so horror &amp; action fans should have a good enough time with it. Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

I am talking about the pitch fork scene which i found over the top and it had no revelenceo the main story.

		<fullReview>The moment that sums this film up the best is the beginning. The juxtaposition between the town in flames - looking like the devil's hometown - and 2 days prior when the town is sleepy, humble and even a little humdrum. The performances are good, but for something like this you don't need great acting, the story just carries the audience. The scares are a little predictable, but the problem with horror films nowadays is that they are merely jumpy; not scary. There's never anything that makes your skin crawl, but there are a number of moments that make you jump out of the aforementioned skin.The main crux of this review is the fact that it is awfully Stephen King. I even had to look this film up to see whether it was taken from a Stephen King Novel. You know what I'm talking about. The corn-fed little town that slowly deteriorates into hell; the few people who know about the problem but are impeded by the fat-cats lusting after money.This film is a must see, if you're a fan of zombies attacking the masses, rather than zombies attacking gun-wielding super soldiers. Old-fashioned story grounded in today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No matter how good a film might be, there are always naysayers. This time around, ignore the "I didn't think this was as good as they said" habitual whiners and give it a play because THE CRAZIES IS FUNNY AS ALL OUT! I've been a fan of Breck Eisner's since his father, Michael Eisner, single handedly dismantled Disney and turned it into a multi million money empire machine. His son's a little out there, that's for sure. And geez, I could see why he wanted to "Kill Mr. Kinski" after watching "Crawlspace". Seriously weird aura on that guy..."Sahara" (2005) is a tough act to follow "The Crazies" (the original is always the best). But there's some creaky performances here, with lots of dark lighting, Spanish moss, and Iowa farm lands. The old house is a lot spookier than "Haunted Mansion", which makes the occasional scare a little creepier and more believable. At times it looks like they were running a little low on money *wink* - not surprising given the production company.Is there better Breck Eisner stuff? Yep. But "The Crazies" got a quasi-plausible beginning, a middle and an end (which is more than can be said about a lot of low budget dreck out there). The constant bird cawing was a bit annoying (I wish somebody'd get a new sound effects tape - we've heard that dumb bird in a hundred movies).I had been on the Haunted Mansion ride as kid in Disneyland, and I love it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a horror movie. This is a thriller with suspense and some horror elements.I enjoyed this movie a lot. The suspense was nicely built up and there were many different types of scenes to keep the movie interesting. This is not a typical cheap horror film like one might think from the title. This is a thriller movie filmed intelligently and with craft. The story is not original, its fairly standard science fiction, but it is good enough to keep things rolling.The acting of the two leads, the sheriff and his wife, was excellent. When you have this caliber of acting in a movie it lends a much more serious and believable tone to the entire film.

		<fullReview>This movie reminds me of the reason I love a good zombie movie; world coming to an end and you have to fight just to live another ten minutes. This movie does a good job at introducing the infected into this normal town, a man shows up with a shotgun at a baseball game and the sheriff is forced to "put him down", reminded me of how well Dawn of the Dead introduced there zombies. In this movie they make everyone go crazy and loose there minds in a very violent way when they get infected, resulting in very gory and horrific scenes; maybe too much for some. The actors in this movie I thought did a great job with what they were given and the makeup for the infected was very real.Another thing this movie had going for it was it made you feel like this could possibly happen. I found myself like usual screaming at the t.v. telling the characters what to do, in this movie it was like they listened. They show the military doing the best they can to save the rest of the world from infection. The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that in some scenes they tried for too much suspense, sometimes dragging out the scenes. Overall I really enjoyed this movie because it was so close to a zombie movie, but then again I really love zombie movies. If you do too I recommend this movie.-Xeno WutEv.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is based on a 1973 film of the same name, now, for the record, I haven't seen the original so you'll get no comparisons here. Although rather formulaic, it's still a pretty enjoyable, if scary and at times gory film. There's more from me later, but here's a brief summary first (summary haters please stop acting crazy while I write the next paragraph).NOTE: Although every effort is made to give as little away as possible in my summaries, sometimes a little extra may slip out. If you feel you may read something here that may spoil your future enjoyment of the film then PLEASE DO NOT read the following paragraph. (I don't know? one person whinges and you've got to put disclaimers all over the place!!) It's a typical day in a small town in Iowa, there is a baseball game going on and the town sheriff, David Dutten, is there with his deputy, Russell Clank. When a local man wanders onto the pitch carrying a shotgun, Dutten is left with no option but to shoot him. Thinking he was drunk, he goes about his day but feels there's something odd about it. The next day he discovers the man was sober. More and more incidents begin to happen around the town and Dutten decides to take his wife, Judy, the town doctor, and leave. There's a problem though, the army have now arrived in biohazard suits and are rounding the townspeople up? I'll leave it here, that should be intrigue enough.This is a very well made film; you can tell it had a decent budget. The effects and the stunts are all very well done and the cinematography is pretty decent too. I thought Timothy Olyphant played the part of the Sheriff very well, but it's a part that seems to fit him pretty well. Radha Mitchell has a good scream (in places) as his wife Judy and I thought Joe Anderson was also pretty good as Russell Clank (although it's a very comedy name).I said at the beginning that I found this one pretty formulaic, what I mean is that it follows a similar pattern to several other films I've seen in the past. I'd like to name a couple but I'm getting accused of giving out spoilers? At the end of the day, it's a pretty solid film with a few scares and some gory moments. A little predictable but perfectly watchable? Recommended.My score: 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crazies" was crazy! (That wasn't cliché was it?) This 2010 movie is a remake of George Romero's 1973 film also called "The Crazies". Director Breck Eisner completely modernizes the original story, turning "The Crazies into more than just your average zombie film where everyone just runs around biting people. Also any movie that starts off playing John Cash has to be half way decent, right?Timothy Olyphant almost drove me "crazy" in this movie. I am sorry, but the man is a horrible actor. He can only display two emotions: surprise and bored. Lucky for him that is all this movie required. Anytime a crazy person his seen, he is surprised and when they are walking around, he looks bored. Which pretty much mirrored my emotions while I was watching the movie. I strongly believe that if Eisner would have casted a better leading man, it would have gotten the movie another star. The movie began with -1 stars just for the fact it has Olyphant in it. (That statement isn't completely true, because I like the show Deadwood staring Olyphant as the lead, but once again Olyphant is my least favorite character.)Read full review at FlicksWorthWatching.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) is sheriff of Ogden Marsh, a picture- perfect American town with happy, law-abiding citizens. But one night, one of them comes to a school baseball game with a loaded shotgun, ready to kill. Another man burns down his own house...after locking his wife and young son in a closet inside. Within days, the town has transformed into a sickening asylum; people who days ago lived quiet, unremarkable lives have now become depraved, blood-thirsty killers, hiding in the darkness with guns and knives. Sheriff Dutten tries to make sense of what's happening as the horrific, nonsensical violence escalates. Something is infecting the citizens of Ogden Marsh...with insanity. Now complete anarchy reigns as one by one the townsfolk succumb to an unknown toxin and turn sadistically violent. In an effort to keep the madness contained, the government uses deadly force to close off all access and won't let anyone in or out - even those uninfected. The few still sane find themselves trapped: Sheriff Dutten; his pregnant wife, Judy (Radha Mitchell); Becca (Danielle Panabaker), an assistant at the medical center; and Russell (Joe Anderson), Dutten's deputy and right- hand man. Forced to band together, an ordinary night becomes a horrifying struggle for survival as they do their best to get out of town alive.well 71% Rotten Tomatoes rating, its pretty cool. still i thought it will be just another silly bad remake and a soulless dull and boring horror movie but, no, it turned out to be a very good movie. i am totally shocked about the fact that how good this movie is. i have not seen the original movie but this one was awesome. its one of the most entertaining movie of the year. right from the beginning it caught my attention and kept my interest till the end. very suspenseful and thrilling movie. it was scary too, not the psychopath people but the movie. i thought they will be zombies but no, the chemical stuff in water turns them to some psycho minded people that become very violent and start killing other people.you can't really tell about the acting performances in this kind of movie but everyone did a fine job, decent one. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell looked good in there characters along with the other cast. i was not sure i'll watch this movie when it was released, but here i am after like 7 or 8 months i thought i'll give it a try because of the reviews, i wanted to watch this movie along with the others towards the end of the year. it wasn't that important but i was wrong.Direction was good, screenplay smartly written concerning this kind of movie, very interesting, entertaining, suspenseful and thrilling screenplay which will keep you going without getting bored even for a minute trust me on that. cinematography is good too, nice location. special effects are OK. decent looks and all. good styling. i enjoyed it and so will you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Virus escape again from government custody</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had forgotten that I had actually seen this film in the Spring at a free film series at IU. At least until they took the Ford in for a car wash. I remember that! And I had renewed interest since discovering Timothy Olyphant of Justified (FX) fame.If you have seen Outbreak with Dusin, Morgan, and Donald you saw a really big budget pesky virus film.But this was more low key and really good.I know it is a remake of Romero's movie, but it deserves to be remade to remind of us that the government will always try to cover up their colossal mistakes.A great intimate film that boils down to only a few characters fighting for survival in Iowa.I rented it for a buck and will seek out George's original too! Oh, consider waiting to get your car washed until spring. (not a spoiler).It seems as tho the government just can't keep it's viruses in a secure manner.NOTE: Oh, JD in a March 2, 2010 review said, "One of the zombies, at the beginning stages of becoming a zombie, actually gets taken to the doctor. After reacting extremely strangely to the doctor, so strange that the doctor should consider hospitalization or getting mental experts involved, she basically says to the family "Have him take two of these and call me in the morning"! Guy goes home and proceeds to kill his family. Doctor, after a complete swing and a miss on the diagnosis, takes no responsibility for the deaths whatsoever."This happens all the time in real LIFE! I know a local doc who missed several patients one near death and another who died. He took no responsibility. Just FYI.D J</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting story, but lots of blood and gore.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>David and Judy Dutten didn't always have the same last name. They were childhood sweethearts in this small Iowa town of population 1260. David was the popular guy in school and a good athlete. He was good enough to get a try-out with a minor league baseball team but after a farming accident injured his throwing arm, he gave up that dream. Judy was the popular girl in school, one of the cheerleaders, but also the senior class Valedictorian. When David decided to stick around Ogden Marsh, Judy went off to college then to medical school. But David and Judy were in love and as he eventually became sheriff, she came back to become the community doctor. They are extremely happy together, and in fact just expecting their first child.(None of that back story was actually in the movie, but I made it up because it seems like a plausible story.) Their world changes this fateful day when, at the opening baseball game of the high school season a local man wanders onto the field of play holding a shotgun. David rushes out to meet him near second base and try to talk sense into him, but the man raises the gun and David is forced to shoot and kill him.This incident starts the awareness that something is very wrong in the community. Soon after another man becomes crazed, locking his wife and son into an upstairs bedroom then setting the house on fire.About that time several hunters discover a body in the Marsh, still strapped to a parachute, probably dead for a couple of weeks. They soon suspect there is a connection between the airplane found under water in the Marsh and the crazy behavior of some of the citizens.Timothy Olyphant is David Dutten and Radha Mitchell is his wife Judy Dutten.I found myself fast-forwarding through many of the scenes where crazy people were chasing sane people, with the violence and bloodshed that goes along with it. I found the story interesting, but I don't really like all the gore.SPOILERS: The plane was headed to Texas with a load of experimental biowarfare substance for incineration, but it crashed into the body of water that ultimately provides drinking water for the community. The substance was designed to "de-stabilize" a population, and was working very well in Ogden Marsh. As David and Judy finally were leaving the area in a commandeered truck, there was a very large flash for the explosion set off by the military to "contain" Ogden Marsh. All they needed to do was get to the next city. As they approached it we see a news telecast, and the signal soon begins to flicker, and as the movie ends we find that area will be next for the "containment operation." So David and Judy did not really escape!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent Romero remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Updated remake of George A. Romero's original underrated 1973 shock feature. Beck Eisner is straight forward with this tragic incident of a plane crash in Iowa turning a small town of friendly faces into raving murderous maniacs. The water supply is tainted with a mysterious toxin being transported by the military. Citizens become gravely ill and others turn into mindless slayers. Sheriff David Dutton(Timothy Olyphant)and his deputy(Joe Anderson)try to make sense of the chaos, but the government is rapid in placing the town under quarantine. A bullet to the brain seems to take care of the infected. Violent and gruesome is the battle between neighbors, friends the gas-mask wearing military. Also in the cast: Rahda Mitchell, Danielle Panabaker, Brett Rickaby, Christie Lynn Smith and Joe Reegan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another top notch horror remake that fills every need</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen the original film created by Zombie Master George Romero, in fact when I went in to see The Crazies I didn't even have the knowledge that this was a remake at all but even if I had known it wouldn't have swayed my opinions because I for one have loved the recent onslaught of horror film remakes. The Hills Have Eyes, The Ring, Nightmare on Elm Street, The Amityville Horror and so on. The Crazies is the perfect Stephen King-esquire Zombie flick that keeps you peeled to the screen from beginning to end. All the elements are firmly in place small town, mysterious outbreak, solid leading heroes and a great story. The Zombie angle can always seem predictable and overdone but The Crazies keeps the story fresh and original. The shocking aspect of the Zombie craze including the neighbours that are very close watching each other murder people in horrifying and insane ways. From the intensity of a well known neighbour stumbling into a baseball field with a shotgun to escaping from their small town this one will leave you literally on the edge of your seat.I have become a huge fan of Timothy Olyphant who I am convinced will continue to rise in stardom. He has amazing screen chemistry, he's always very versatile, and carries a film flawlessly. He proves that in The Crazies as he plays the cowboy like hero David. Radha Mitchell is also a terrific actress. She has a lot of terrific roles under her belt. Her and Olyphant have great chemistry together. She is always the perfect scream queen being a strong female lead and still show some vulnerability (see her in Silent Hill.) Joe Anderson is amazing as Olyphant's deputy. He's the good guy, but a bit of anti-hero and just fun to watch. He seems so naive and yet really has some strength to his character. I have become a fan of Danielle Panabaker ever since she played James Woods' daughter in Shark. She's cute, and spunky but can still be a very adult character. She good chemistry with the rest of the cast and its fun to see her in this role. The rest of the supporting cast are excellent but it really is focused entirely on the four of them.I think director Breck Eisner has a lot of promising films ahead of him especially now that he's connected to the Escape from New York remake. He really does well commanding the cast and the setting for The Crazies is absolutely perfect. He does the perfect mix of horror, thriller, zombie and even a touch of drama to the whole idea. I don't think its any coincidence that lead writer Scott Kosar has written some truly brilliant films and remakes that I previously mentioned. He penned the amazing Amityville Horror remake, Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake and the unheard of gem The Machinist. Some will of course call The Crazies terrible and everything else because its not the picture perfect Hollywood critics choice but for the real movie goers looking for true entertainment and if you're a horror buff you won't regret a single minute of The Crazies. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Crazies" is better than average horror fare, replete with a fairly substantial budget, excellent make-up effects and a good if not clichéd premise. (spoilers) The story is lean - a bit too lean - and needs perhaps more development of the pathogen. Also some common logic seems to be fleeting here - why are the "crazies" acting together? Why are they not attacking one another? How could the couple survive a full on traffic accident with scratches walking away? The satellite "googlesque" mapping which sort of cuts-in as interjections is cope-out cheese. The acting is passable, while the ending poorly left open. The movie doesn't quite have a grasp of what it is - a horror zombie movie? Or sci-fi-ish biological weapons disaster - both but should stick more to one or the other. Movie could've been a lot worse though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since I've seen the original "Crazies" movie, so I don't remember much about it except I didn't find it very engaging. So I was willing to watch this remake - maybe they would have improved on it. And on some levels, the movie does seem to improve on the original. The look of the movie is well done, giving the movie a gritty feel and you sense the feeling of isolation and an ongoing threat. The acting is also acceptable.Unfortunately, the screenplay gives the viewer no surprises. While the idea of a plague in a small community and the government's efforts to conceal and control it may have been fresh when the original film was made, more than 30 years later it's been done to death. Practically every plot turn in this movie has been done in another movie before. I made a little game while watching this movie of predicting how a scene would play out, and I was almost always correct.This isn't a bad movie - but there's no reason to watch it, because you've seen it many times before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this recently as a pay per view, and I must say, whoever did the trailer did a hell of a job. The rest of the movie turned out to be a major letdown. "The Crazies" starts off in a small Iowa town, just as a local baseball game is going on. There we meet the young, handsome Sheriff, (Are there ever any average looking people in movie parts today?)Who looks like he just graduated college last week, and his (of course model looking wife, a local doctor) All seems to be going well enough until a local man enters the field carrying a shotgun. The sheriff jumps into action and after a brief standoff, has to shoot the man. Everyone chalks it up to booze, but investigation reveals that's not the case. After several other townspeople start acting very strange, we have the start a (*yawn*) zombie movie. That's where this movie goes so dismally wrong. Scene after scene of weak "scares" that you can see coming from a mile away, along with the most annoying habit of everyone coming to the rescue of the main characters at EXACTLY the right time! There's really no one who I rooted for, nor cared about in th whole movie because they told you nothing about the characters as people. The movie starts and literally two minutes later, zombies start showing up! Bottom line, very predictable, by the numbers, boring zombie picture. Don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent zombie infection film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The government accidentally drops a plane with biological weapons in an "agricultural community" (read this as "a bunch of rednecks") then proceeds to exterminate everybody in order to cover up/stop the spread of the disease using the wonderful human drones called soldiers. They follow every bad move in the book, including always wearing gas masks, never saying anything useful, using violence and coercion to reach their goals, shooting on sight and then burning the bodies. Naturally, the rednecks object.Now, it is hard for me to take sides. Would I have stood there as cattle waiting for the slaughter if I was in their place? Would I have tried everything to survive and thus carry the disease into more populated areas? I don't know. The film was good, the infected behaved as sick people not as dumb zombies most of the time, the acting was OK.What bothered me in this film is the clichés. Said drone army was too impersonal, the crazed infected people were behaving ridiculously even for zombies, the good guys were all good, etc. What was even lamer was that the violent scenes were suggested, with the blood and bodies and such not shown. What did they want with that? A PG rated horror film? I mean, it is either ridiculous gory pointless violence like saw or other films like that, or it's this "this film is too high budget to show real violence" in the movies that really needed it!Bottom line: I know it's a Romero remake, so by that standard it's pretty neat, but did they really have to make all crazies stupid and homicidal? Did they have to make the only two main characters educated and decent, even when drowned in a sea of "agriculture"? Did they have to make the "govment" act so illogical and , for lack of a better word, zombie like? It would have been a lot more scary if the demarcation line was blurrier by just a fraction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a child, my mother would take me through the automatic car wash at a BP station near our home. One of my favorite parts was when the windshield would be covered in a layer of white soap. Eventually, there was a thin line of yellow, red, and blue soap added on top of the white one. Mother said it was a marketing trick to encourage kids to pester their folks for another visit. I loved the anticipatory feeling of waiting for the process to begin and then seeing the cloth flaps moving over our car. In the modern version of The Crazies, characters are fleeing from zombie-like sick people and the US military when they attempt to hide in an automatic car wash. They trigger the device and are suddenly obscured under a layer of rainbow soaps and cloth flaps. Their assailants are still outside and begin tearing into the car. After the car wash ends, we see the sick people, just before a bomb destroys the car (without the heroes in it).Those moments of very real fear from commonplace experiences give the new Crazies a more personalized feel than Romero's version. Director Breck Eisner (Sahara) places several cheap "boo" moments like that into this movie. Either he was clever enough to realize this story lacks the capacity to be great or he simply adhered to common horror clichés. I find the ending result to be a satisfying substitution for the seriousness and contrivance of the original. This movie is at least entertaining.Like the first film, a virus has been released into the water supply of a small town. It causes people to go crazy (get it?) and become great horror movie antagonists. It starts at a baseball game and soon nearly the entire population is under its effect. The US military sweeps up everyone and places them in a concentration camp adapted from a high school. The local sheriff, eluding capture, breaks in with his deputy to save his wife. The three of them later encounter a teenage couple and attempt to escape. The teenagers die and the deputy sacrifices himself to the military so the sheriff and his wife can escape. After a run in with diseased rednecks, the two of them arrive at a larger town that will now have to be quarantined.This may have been the type of movie Romero was trying to make. There is a lot of interaction between the crazies and heroes this time. No references are made to the government. The military's only storytelling purpose is to provide a faux feeling of terror whenever there are no crazies are around. Romero could have streamlined this disjointedness into a consistently scary atmosphere if his distributors had let him. Even though he didn't direct it, his trademarked anti-military message is still there. It's much less explicit than previously. Instead of seeing a government official say, "we have to stop the spread of this disease," a bomb is dropped on the town near the end. Eisner portrays the military as a whole as brutal, but spares individual soldiers from criticism. Like the cheapie scares, it's a clear cop-out. But in a remake, does that matter?

I think it disappointed a lot of viewers because there was so much hype and the entertainment did not return. Sorry Breck Eisner but this movie seized to entertain me as much as it should have. They could've done a much better job here considering the had a great story line they just went wrong with it.

That realization is the primal theme of this movie and will leave many feeling unease and fearful of those around us. As many have said before, this isn't a zombie movie although it's gore and makeup effects(which are superb, by the way) may suggest otherwise to some people, but rather an examination of the true horror of the unknown and the mistakes and carelessness that sometimes plague our society. With stunning performances and minimal special effects, The Crazies is one of the better horror movies of the year. Not quite up there with the likes of 28 Days Later or Shutter Island, but if you want to see a god horror film then this is the film to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Improving on the original Romero "classic" (as some call it) is not hard. The original had a shoe-string budget which-combined with poor acting- gave it an almost most 70's porn film production value. That aside the central premise is solid and this remake executes it well.An army bio-weapon, code named Trixie, is accidentally dumped into a small everyday Americana white picket-fenced homes in a farm town's water supply. Once ingested Trixie sets off a "viral" madness which grows exponentially out of control....The thunder has been stolen from this concept in recent years- the "28 days/weeks double being the most significant- but there is no use in complaining about that when you have flogged to death horror franchises and their rebooted efforts on the horizon every other month! Jason, Michael and Freddy please take note.....The film focuses as much on the military containment efforts- and the "clear-up" process which has shades of the Third Reich's final solution. These elements are more emotionally affecting than the well made horror action set-pieces, as the real horror is being treated like cattle by your own; ring-fenced with razor wire and bar-coded without explanation.What would have improved the film? A little more focus on the initial townsfolk, a flamboyant one take tracking camera shot of various acts of murder, madness and odd behaviour in the town- weaving through homes, back out into the street etc, just for a minute or two to give it scope. Another element which is played on, but not fully examined is "Do I have the virus or do you?" paranoia. This could have created a truly unsettling atmosphere and racked up the tension even more.One missed opportunity: I have an indeliable memory of a scene from the original. Although this version is flawed, it still had one of Romero's ace scenes in it- Picture if you will.... The view from inside the gas mask of a soldier who finds one of the locals in the infected town; a little old lady, smiling-rocking back and forth in her chair. The soldier is concerned, urging her to come with him and leave the house. She gets up- seemingly in total compliance- &amp; whilst still smiling, drives the knitting needles into the soldier! Now that could have been left in as a homage to the original. The ending of this remake has no real surprises, left open for an unnecessary sequel, but this film is a decent afternoon's popcorn entertainment horror flick.</fullReview>

Until they got killed and unlike zombies they stayed DEAD. I liked the remake more than the original. It was more of what I expected from the original. It had to more of the towns people and less of the military. The acting was far superior in this one as well. The only thing that was really better in the original was the end. Hollywood today would not do an ending like that any more. I would have given a better rating if the end remotely came close to Romero original ending.

		<fullReview>When Zack Snyder presented us with with his re-imagining of George Romero's Dawn of the Dead back in '04, he reminded many horror fans that, in the right hands, remakes can be surprisingly good (it also made Romero himself hot property again, although old George has done plenty to rectify that in recent years).Director Breck Eisner clearly intends to try and pull off the same trick with his updated version of Romero's 'lesser classic' The Crazies, which boasts equally slick production values, also features a talented but relatively unknown cast, and similarly concentrates more on action and shock horror than its comparatively subdued predecessor. And for a while, it looks as though he might succeed.Unfortunately, after a well executed first half during which Eisner carefully establishes his characters and gradually reveals their terrifying predicament, the story has very few places left to go; this leaves the director desperately trying to pad out his film to a decent running time before delivering the inevitable explosive finale. The result is a fairly fun but logic-free effort that offers one or two well handled scenes of gory mayhem, but also plenty of plot-holes, and quite a few moments of sheer inanity.Unforgivably, Eisner also botches the film's big revelation?the real secret behind the film's horrible epidemic?by having it blurted out in seconds by a hastily introduced character, before quickly returning to the action. Well, what did I really expect from the man who directed Sahara? I suppose I should be grateful for the fact that the film was any where near as entertaining as it actually was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sheriff of Ogden Marsh, Iowa, finds his town overrun by the military when the citizens turn into psychopaths after drinking the water supply infected by a biological weapon called Trixie, caused by a downed plane which crashed in a lake. Sheriff David Dutton(Timothy Olyphant)goes back for his wife, Judy(Sasha Mitchell) after she is pulled away from him, separated because she was running a fever(she is pregnant), quarantined and left strapped to a gurney along with local girl, Becca(Danielle Panabaker)when the crazies break from a stronghold, executed by soldiers. Dutton, along with trusty deputy, Russell Clank(Joe Anderson, in a star making performance), will hunt for Judy, hoping to find her before danger strikes. Not only will they have to avoid the infected but the military as well, who seem to now be operating by orders to kill the entire town. Hoping to evade every threat they come across, on foot unless they are to find a vehicle not ruined purposely by the military, David, Judy, Russell, and Becca will try their very level best to get out of dodge, attempting to flee the perimeter.Was this one intense! I often applaud a movie that has me biting my nails..a nail biter to me is accomplished when it draws you in through the perilous situations which plague characters which I care for. It's inevitable that we compare one film to another, the original to it's "re-invisioning", and I admit, being an absolute admirer of Romero's critically maligned classic(it seems that even Romero faithful question "The Crazies" worth, sad to say), I think that director Breck Eisner's version has better leads..frankly, I found the leads in Romero's movie rather colorless, for the most part. There are some nice homages to Romero's original which I credit Eisner and the filmmakers for such as the horrifying sequence involving the father setting ablaze his house with his wife and kid he locked in a closet trapped inside, and an amusing cameo from Lynn Lowry as a woman singing a tune while riding her bicycle in town! Potent suspense sequences galore..Judy and Becca are strapped to a gurney as the man they once knew as a principal is stabbing other bodies with a pitchfork closing in on them, David having to shoot a farmer who was toting a shotgun during a baseball game in front of the attending crowd, David is then attacked by that farmer's infected wife and son while Judy is tied to a chair, the truck stop finale as David and Judy must defend themselves against savage hunters afflicted with virus, and an attack on David, Judy, Russell, and Becca while their car is stuck in a car wash machine. In this remake, we not only see mental deterioration and eventual psychopathic lapses into violence, but hideous physiological effects as well. Like in the original, the virus is named Trixie and the cause remains identical, a plane crashes into a lake, carrying a biological agent to poison an American enemies' city, entering accidentally into the water of our own people. I liked the decision in this movie to focus the central plot around the sheriff and his deputy. Russell saves David's life like three different times, and remains a vital emotional arc in the movie as he discovers he might be infected as he becomes more paranoid, using his gun when not needed, and behaving irrationally. One of the more shocking scenes involves Becca having to watch helplessly as her boyfriend and his mom are executed by soldiers, ordered, it seems, by their superiors, to eliminate anyone in the city. Another terrible discovery at the truck stop eerily reminds us of the holocaust, a subtext that is quite disturbing, not to mention the gathering of the citizens by the military as if they were sheep(and, again, we see the soldiers gunning them down as they herd in fear, even those who haven't succumbed to the infection)to the slaughter. The military, unlike Romero's, remain faceless, hiding behind face masks and bio-gear, chemical suits and machine guns. Only two specific military types are unmasked because they service the movie as exposition of the plot. I will warn you that the film uses loud sound effects to amplify jump scares, but I think the sparse musical score, which does it's job, I felt, at mounting unease and dread, and the use of silence as characters move about outside and throughout whatever building they might be at at any given moment, not knowing where an infected lunatic might be lurking, can be positively spine-tingling.I do think there logical lapses from time to time with moments where I assume viewers will be eye-rolling, whispering to themselves, "Yeah, right." What I mean by that is there are plenty of times where characters escape the jaws of death in the nick of time, our heroes are able to avoid capture, walking freely in the open despite the knowledge that the military is round abouts. No doubt about it, the outlook is grim from the opening shot of the town of Ogden Marsh desolate and burning with the sound of flames never more wrenching. Finally, Olyphant graduates into the lead role with fine support from Mitchell as his concerned/worried pregnant wife, watching everyone they've ever knew killed or turning into monster. Certainly one of the better remakes I've seen in recent memory because it knows how to push your buttons..or it certainly did mine!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies are coming</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The set up: The Crazies opening scene is of an anonymous main street somewhere in America in flames and ruins. Flashback two days and we are in Ogden Marsh, IA. Johnny Cash sings We'll Meet Again over scenes of cornfields and the town folks getting ready to attend a high school baseball game. In other words we are in Hollywood's version of fly over country where the town sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) is married to the beautiful town doctor (Radha Mitchell) . The peaceful facade doesn't last long. The first hint of violence to come is in the form of the former town drunk stumbling onto the ball field with a shotgun. The sheriff is forced to shoot him in front of the what is more than likely the entire town's population. I couldn't help but think what would have happened if Sheriff Andy had been forced to shoot Mayberry's lovable Otis instead of locking him up overnight to sleep it off. Needless to say things go downhill fast and the residents of Ogden Marsh soon realize they are all slowly going "crazy" and cut off from the rest of the world.The Good: The Crazies was number three at the box office this weekend behind the Avatar juggernaut which weighed in as number two. I expected as much because it is really a very solid horror movie. I won't dwell on the acting as it was neither great of sub par. I don't think Timothy Olyphant has ever risen to the level of his performance as the charming, sleazy drug dealer in 1999's GO. I was impressed by Joe Anderson's performance as the deputy desperately fighting to hold onto his sanity. I looked him on IMDb and still cannot place him precisely even though he has been in movies I have seen. The Crazies also managed to impress by what was left out. There is violence a 'plenty but it never reached the level of torture porn that saturates movies like Saw. It's just enough to give you nightmares.The Bad: I'm over the government conspiracy plot device. I lost some of my interest in this movie when it moved from the small story of the town slowly unraveling to scenes of the government swooping in with a classic cover-up. I would have preferred the dark menacing story taking place among the town's residents. Interesting scary things happen when you put things like power tools in the hands of "crazies". I won't even try to describe the creativity of the funeral parlor director when he catches the "crazy". Let's just say I would have liked more of that and less of quarantine camps and abusive soldiers. Also in the end the lengths the government went to seemed over the top.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'The Crazies' while interesting, is mostly by-the-numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of George Romero's 1973 film, The Crazies, Timothy Olyphant (Hitman) plays Dave Dutton, a sheriff in a small town that has become infected by a virus causing the citizens to start killing each other. Dave finds out that this was probably due to the water supply being tainted by the government's accidental chemical spill. He and his doctor wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and two friends are soon chased by the crazies (the infected) as well as the military who are trying to eradicate all the infected (and possibly the uninfected).Now, I have not seen the original, so I can't say whether this film is a better film than that one or whether it's wise even to use the earlier film as a standard to gauge any film. I will say that I'll review it as I always do (as it should be) based on my personal experience. With that said, I'll first say I do enjoy sci-fi horror much more than fantasy horror or slashers--they often usually have some underlying theme somewhere. With this film, there are certainly themes regarding the dangers of the "big brother" government coverups.This film, in essence, is a zombie film, although they aren't technically zombies. Much like 28 Days Later, they are like viral zombies (because it involves a virus), generally--they're still people, but not quite themselves. What makes them dangerous is that they want to kill normal people. Unfortunately, we're not told in detail exactly how this virus works that makes them want to kill. Does it make people aggressive and rabid like 28 Days Later? Not really--many of these guys seem rather calculated and well, slow, most of the time. For me, them being "crazy" didn't seem like a strong enough reason. After all, these aren't cannibals like zombies that has a hunger nor a built-in need to assimilate the population, like pod people. These guys generally just want to kill. If new people do get infected by the virus, it's mostly by accident, not because these guys bite. Regular zombies are scarier than these "crazies" because they play with our fears of the animalistic, killer nature. These guys, however, while they do use tools, just don't elicit that feeling of urgent threat that zombies give.On the other hand, one may argue that the real enemy is the government. Not only do the protagonists have to deal with the crazies, they have to deal with the military trying to kill them. This aspect makes the film feel more like a thriller than a horror film.I felt director Breck Eisner's approach to this film was quite by-the-numbers. There aren't anything I haven't seen before and I found many scenes tobe mostly predictable (if you've seen films of this ilk). I did, though, enjoy the tense set up at the beginning involving the sheriff'sstand-off with a so-called "town drunk." Mostly, I felt rest of the film relied too much on jump scenes punctuated by loud tunes, a overused gimmick seen in many modern B-movie horror flicks. There's plenty of close-up shots and shaky camera. With that said, there are some fun scenes, such as the car-wash scene and the ending--they were somewhat different. I wished the film worked more on the feeling of atmosphere. For the squeamish, there are plenty of gore and many corpses in this film.Timothy Olyphant as the sheriff remains consistently likable, despite the fact that he doesn't have any deep moments that push him beyond the usual confines of the genre. Radha Mitchell (Surrogates) comes off very natural and sympathetic as his pregnant wife. True, the dialogue could've done more with her (especially since she's a doctor and a doctor in a horror flick could be used to great effect, I would think), but she works well with what she's given. The character interactions are usually fun and Joe Anderson as the deputy add much needed humor and some danger.Overall, while I was entertained, many scenes felt a little repetitive and excitement or actual creepiness factor wasn't particularly high for me. Whether it's more a homage or simply lack of innovation, the movie felt quite by-the-numbers in its execution. I suppose it didn't help that the "crazies" felt like toned-down zombies to me. Interesting ending, though. I give The Crazies ** ? out of **** stars.You can find my updates of movie reviews on http://twitter.com/d_art</fullReview>

And, I have to admit, there were a few parts that made me jump and even one that made me scream! And I'll tell you now, I'm not the easiest person to scare. I'm not going to tell you what it's about because I'm sure you already know. The film begins average. Any old day in any old town. As the film progresses, you see everything literally going CRAZY. The directing was good, the acting was believable, and they actually have a reason as to why everything is going crazy. I came to see the film for two reasons: Joe Anderson and the film looked awesome. Joe blew me away and the film lived slightly higher than my expectations. Seven stars. I would put 7/5 but I can't vote like that.OFFICIALLY RECOMMENDED BY ME.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies Will Inherit the Earth</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love the social-commentary-infused horror films of George Romero as much as any other genre loyalist, but I think most would forgive my dissent toward his 1973 effort, "The Crazies": regarding the fallout of a biological warfare agent accidentally released in a small Pennsylvania town that reduces the residents to screw-loose murderers, the film was a lethargic mix of preachy politics and over-the-top gore that ultimately did little more than affirm that, yes, guys in HazMat suits ARE pretty darned creepy. The long-gestating remake of "The Crazies" (director Brad "Session 9" Anderson was once attached to direct) is one genre revision I have actually been looking forward to. The good news? The filmmakers didn't screw it up. Taking the husk of Romero's original plot and dissolving much of the heavy-handed sermonizing, Scott ("The Machinist") Kosar's script instead focuses on an intimate group of characters (including Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell) facing a surreal, 48-hour societal breakdown, and the measures they resort to in order to survive. Kosar's script is a model of genre economy: he keeps the characters realistic, the locations authentic, the situations genuinely terrifying, and the tone refreshingly barren of ironic, tongue-in-cheek humor. As I watched "The Crazies," fond memories of John Erick Dowdle's similarly-themed "Quarantine" came to mind; while yet another remake (of the well-regarded Spanish shocker "(REC)"), it transcended its parent by never allowing its tone to be anything less than urgent, and keeping the story moving at a breakneck pace. Thanks to the surprisingly confident direction of Breck (son of Michael) Eisner, the transition from script to screen is frequently astonishing: while the opening minutes of the film are somewhat wobbly (with moments of bad acting and an unfortunate prelude scored to Johnny Cash), "The Crazies" hits its stride quickly, presenting a group of characters worth rooting for and a sense of small-town familiarity that is only heightened (and made all the more terrifying) by the use of an earth-tone color scheme and gritty digital video. For most of its running time, "The Crazies" is a remake to be reckoned with, using a bigger budget and improved FX to diligently cement its impact: too bad the post-production, "sequel much?" final shot cheapens some of what has gone on before.6.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Crazies is a remake of George A. Romero's 1973 film of the same name. The story revolves around a town whose water supply has been poisoned by an mysterious and unknown toxin.To be honest there's nothing really new here, but that really doesn't matter. The Crazies is made in such a way that not many other horror movies are. Rather than just throwing random and senseless violence at you, director Breck Eisner actually builds up suspense instead. It works brilliantly and it's a refreshing change from other recent horrors that are basically just splatter-fests.Although this story has been done before in movies such as 28 Days Later and, to some extent, Cabin Fever, this movie plays it out incredibly well. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell are brilliant in the main character roles, Mitchell more than making up for her role in 2006's disappointing Silent Hill.The special effects are brilliant, the make-up on the faces of the 'Crazies' is really effective, it's amazing how brilliantly chilling some contact lenses and deformations can make someone look. They're not conventional looking or acting zombies but they're still pretty menacing and amazingly fierce.I'd recommend The Crazies to any horror fan who wants something a little bit different than what's currently out there. It really is a scarily great movie.http://ukmore.tk/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A step up from the original, but still dull overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the original George Romero film The Crazies a few years ago, my first thought after it was over was that it was a pretty great concept that wasn't executed the right way. That's actually my only memory regarding the original film since it wasn't very memorable and not even up to par with Romero's mediocre films. Before news hit that the film was being remade, the thought crossed my mind that a remake could certainly benefit this film. Lo and behold, the film has been remade and is in theaters now.The 2010 remake of The Crazies can be considered an upgrade from the original film. Is it an original concept? No, not really. But when dealing with a remake, aiming for an original concept is kind of silly since it was already done at least once in the original film it's based off of. The Crazies actually felt a lot like if 28 Weeks Later and The Hills Have Eyes (2006) were blended together to make one film. The military being heavily involved and trying to contain the outbreak is what made me think of 28 Weeks Later. The "crazies" themselves and the ending were reminiscent to the last scene at the end of The Hills Have Eyes. Actually, Neil Marshall's Doomsday comes to mind as well. The car wash scene instantly made me think of last year's The Final Destination, which I absolutely hated. Luckily, this car wash was a bit more exciting and the payoff was more satisfying. I hate doing comparisons to other films while thinking of this one, but that was one of the things that irked me about the film. It seemed like most things that occurred throughout the duration of the film were reminiscent of others. Most films do that, but usually have a few distinguishing scenes of their own. A remake, if done properly, should remind you of the original film while introducing a few new elements that stand alone. Originality goes a long way in this medium these days.The pitchfork scene is the main reason to see this film. I've always wondered why pitchforks haven't been used more often in horror films. The movie poster is a huge tease to that scene and it is easily the highlight. Timothy Olyphant in the lead role is another good reason to see this. Olyphant seems to be the type of actor that is skilled enough to get bigger roles, but either picks the wrong parts or is looked over by the studios. He at least had the opportunity to shine in last year's A Perfect Getaway and again here.While The Crazies is an improvement over the original film, it still seems to be lacking something to make it more memorable and is a bit too predictable. There are quite a few interesting kills (the way the lighter comes into play isn't too shabby) and the make-up and CG effects are more than satisfactory, but it often felt like the film borrowed ideas from other horrors and thrillers from the past few years rather than providing something a bit more creative. The Crazies falls a bit flat overall, but is still worth checking out if you're a die hard horror fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one movie I think deserved a remake and the casting of Radha Mitchell and Timothy Olyphant gave some hope but the choice of director did not.The biggest problem is that we don't get to know the townsfolk before they go crazy, so who cares. The scriptwriters obviously either did not have the talent to write a character driven piece or they were intent on getting to the inane action as soon as possible. The inevitable narrow escapes happen one upon the other. Is there anything new here, anything we have not seen before?A really poor re-make and a waste of a talented cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a cerebral horror flick.This is eyes and ears horror - sudden motion and loud noises - a character grabbed by an off-screen hand or a jarringly loud sound effect signaling the climax of a quiet scene of tension. If you find this type of visual and auditory shock horror trite, The Crazies probably isn't for you. If you're a teenager who hasn't seen much horror, this might not be such a bad way to spend an hour and a half.IMO, The Crazies felt more like a made-for-TV movie. Not too gross or violent, but just enough to get you to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon. And, like most horror flicks, there is a high degree of willing-suspension-of-disbelief here, particularly concerning the government's actions.My suggestion - save yourself the full-theater price and either rent it ($2 max) or wait for it to come to TV, which it will. It rates a C (for clichéd).</fullReview>

That's just poor geography when you have a story with so much around destination. Beyond that there's the wild bit that Hollywood likes to use in these type of movies where the military suddenly becomes like something out of the movie Holocast when the Germans round up Jews for extermination camps. Really? Any administration would use that as the first option to deal with a containment situation?

		<fullReview>The formula for zombie movies is pretty simple. And that's probably indicative of why zombie movies tend to do well, because they're predicated on some basic concepts, some primal impulses.The Crazies comes across as a rather big budget zombie movie, but it never seems to put that budget to work to satisfy our most fundamental requirement for liking a zombie film...What the zombies like?!The bulk of this film deals with the protagonists and the protagonists rarely get to come face to face with a zombie transformation, helping us understand what exactly happens when someone converts. Also, the tense moments seem to be missing from the film. There are some, but if you're trying to compete with "28 Weeks Later" and "28 Days Later" and even "Dawn of the Dead," the remake, you have to give the movie a bit of an edge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake of George Romero's 1970s movie (which I never really took to) concerns the attempts of Sheriff Timothy Olyphant and his doctor wife Radha Mitchell to escape the small town of Ogden Marsh after a government accident dumps a chemical in the water supply which turns inhabitants into murderous quasi-zombies. Caught between the Crazies on the one hand, and the military on the other (which has in mind wiping out the entire population before they get out and spread the plague), escape is not going to be easy.This is a pretty solid movie, albeit with no great surprises. The sense of jeopardy never lets up, the action and effects are all top-notch, and there is the quality turn from Mitchell which we've come to expect (and Olyphant isn't bad either, albeit a little lightweight in the sort of role which we would have expected Bill Paxton to play 10 years ago).I don't have any great insights about it, all I have to say is that I thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After a slew of well known horror movies being remade in an awful way (too many to mention, we all know the culprits....Hello PG-13!!!) comes a little known seventies paranoia movie, which is surprisingly good and rather effective.The town of Ogden Marsh is experiencing some of the town folk, going a little bit....Crazy. At first it appears it could be be down to alcohol, but when other people start to have the same symptoms, it appears that there could be something in the water...literally.The film quickly puts us straight into the action when the "army" come into town to start containment. Heavily influenced by films such as '28 days later' and even 'children of the corn', it first appears that this is another small town in peril movie. But this is so much more. Just who are the titular characters. On first viewing, it's simple to label the infected as the titular characters. Go deeper, and it's clear that almost everyone featured in the film are experiencing some sort of breakdown. From the masked soldiers who drop anyone from the town, to the main characters who will do anything to escape the town.Olyphant and Mitchell are surprisingly good as the leads, and the film goes at a frantic pace. There are a few problems along the way though. The film does rely on the old screeching sound mix to up the scare factor, and it appears to have been cut a little, to gain that '15' rating (here in the UK), which means more revenue for the unrated Blu-ray.But it is fun, has some genuine scares, and most importantly, really entertaining set pieces (the car wash, the teacher with the garden fork, and the guy with the gun on the baseball field, which is the most effective).The ending is a little silly and a bit 'Resident Evil', but one feels that this wasn't made for the critics.In an age where horror movies have been dumbed down in favour of gore, this is refreshing.</fullReview>

There's a lot of noise and sudden shocks from off screen and if that's what you look for in a horror movie you will probably be happy enough.If you're looking for a creepy movie then forget it. There's no really good scares and the intended moments of tension are wrecked because it's all pretty predictable. The build up to the action is far more interesting than the action itself but is over very quickly, I think because they were afraid that modern audiences can't go more than 15 minutes without some shooting or shouting.Watch the original, it's got a more interesting cast and is much scarier. I honestly expected to like this movie but by the last half hour I was checking my watch. It's more like an action movie than a proper horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Remake of a Classic Chilller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A catastrophic quandary and several creepy scenes make this ghoulish remake of director George A. Romeo's 1973 classic scary movie "The Crazies" worth watching if you can handle horror movies. Mind you, this $20 million, R-rated quasi-zombie epic boasts just enough gore to qualify for its R-rating. Nevertheless, "Sahara" director Breck Eisner relies on omission during some macabre acts of violence to prompt you to use your own imagination for greater horrific effect than any computer generated imagery. Indeed, this bizarre movie contains suspenseful situations and chilling characters that may have you poised you on the edge of your seat. "The Crazies" cuts its characters no slack, and omnipotent forces are at work here that our heroes cannot comprehend. "Amityville Horror" remake scribe Scott Kosar and "Pulse" writer Ray Wright deliberately have confined the scope of the action to a quartet of characters: a sheriff, his doctor wife, his resourceful deputy, and her young female assistant. Not only does this allow Eisner to drum up a palatable sense of claustrophobia, but it also enables him to breed a queasy paranoia. Eisner maintains the tension throughout without slackening the momentum in this entertaining but sinister melodrama. Moreover, "The Crazies" depicts the dark side of democracy, particularly the wholesale cover-up that the government orchestrates to wipe out any trace of its incompetence after an accident occurs. Not only do our heroes and heroines find themselves trapped when regular Army troops try to exterminate them with extreme prejudice, but they also must contend with their own insane kind that have an urge to kill. Audaciously enough, Eisner and his scenarists shun both incidental humor as well as comic relief characters so that "The Crazies" never turns into a parody.Everybody in a small rural Iowa farming town, with a population of less than 1300 people, suddenly goes berserk in the spring for no apparent reason. Pierce County Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant of "Hitman") is baffled beyond description about why lunacy is the rage. "The Crazies" opens with Ogden Marsh, Iowa, ablaze in a sea of flames. The story begins two days before this quiet Midwestern town erupted into a conflagration. David attends the first high school baseball game of the season with his Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson of "Amelia") when the town drunk shows up in the outfield. David spots the shotgun that Rory Hamill (Mike Hickman of "The Lena Baker Story") has cradled in his hands and hustles across the infield to confront Rory. Meanwhile, Russell clears the teenagers off the baseball diamond. David tries to reason with Rory, but the disturbed man brandishes his shotgun. David drops Rory with one shot. Later, Deardra Farnum (Christie Lynn Smith of "Woman on Top") takes her husband, Bill Farnum (Brett Rickaby of "The Scout"), into the local family medical clinic. David's wife Judy (Radha Mitchell of "High Art") runs the clinic. Judy examines Bill but finds nothing wrong with him. Bill goes berserk that night locks Deardra and son in an upstairs closet and then incinerates the house. David locks up Bill and the psycho stands in his jail cell like a statue for hours until he collapses his face changes colors and his blood veins pop out. Eventually, David visits the town water department superintendent because our hero suspects something might have gotten into the drinking water.Before they realize what has happened, David and Judy find themselves rounded up by U.S. Army soldiers wearing in gas masks and toting assault rifles and hauled off with Russell in a bus to a containment unit. David struggles without success to find somebody in authority with whom he can reason. Eventually, the troops in their protective uniforms separate Judy and David. Judy and David aren't apart for long because other hysterical Ogden Marsh citizens go on the rampage and careen a truck into the Army's containment camp. While David and Russell escape and arm themselves, the military beats a retreat. They leave poor Judy strapped down helplessly to a gurney with no way to escape. They abandon many others like Judy at the local high school when the alarm sounds about the on-slaught of insane citizens. The Army scrambles aloft in their helicopters. Judy lies horror-stricken on her back when her friend, high school Principal Ben Sandborn (Larry Cedar of "Kiss the Girls"), wanders into the area dragging a pitchfork and looking like a nightmare. The tines of the pitchfork screech against the floor as Ben tours the restrained bodies. Spotting Judy, he approaches our heroine, and hoists his pitchfork to impale her like his two previous victims.Olyphant registers solidly in one of his better performances as the beleaguered but sympathetic hero. Cast as the even-handed Pierce County Sheriff David Dutton, the likable Olyphant encounters mayhem and murder like never before during a three day period, while Radha Mitchell appears just as convincing as his beleaguered wife in the early stages of a pregnancy. She also serves as the town doctor so that she isn't entirely out of the loop with regard to the hysteria afflicting her small town. Jon Anderson is especially good as Sheriff Dutton's deputy, who saves his life three times before he suffers from the biochemicals. Director Eisner stages the action with aplomb. Eisner breathes new life into the conventional scene when the hero has trouble getting his vehicle to crank up while the villains approach him. Although he falls back on standard horror movie tactics with an occasional sudden jolt, "The Crazies" is pretty straightforward without being sickening. Eisner and his writers do an excellent job of foreshadowing two subplots that they pay off in subsequent scenes. The knife-in-the-hand scene is one of the best. Altogether, "The Crazies" doesn't meet the criteria of a stupid horror movie with characters doing cretinous deeds to avoid death.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fear Thy Neighbor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reinvention loosely based upon the George Romero classic of the same name, THE CRAZIES is about the inhabitants of a small Kansas town suddenly plagued by insanity and then death after a mysterious toxin contaminates their water supply.I know you've seen it before: A small town is infected and eventually taken over by zombies, crazy people, the government, or any combination of these forces. A few survivors stick with each other in order to survive through the chaos, or, in this case, madness, around them. However, you'd be crazy to judge a film by whether or not the plot is original because look at AVATAR.I like zombie/infection/virus movies, because they are usually entertaining and thrilling to watch, but I have not seen the original film by Romero yet, so I cannot compare this remake with it. However, the film does stand up well in the wave of the many, many horror remakes that have been released. It's a good horror movie because it has one key ingredient that many horror movies fail to ever grasp: The suspense.This film manages to not overuse the cheap scare tactics, even though some are scattered here and there every now and then. There's also some genuine horror and tension here. There's one memorable sequence taking place in a car wash where I was on the edge of my seats. Almost everything in this film is done so well where an average horror movie wouldn't ever succeed in accomplishing half of it.Timothy Olyphant is another key ingredient to the film's success. Although he has been in many films before, this is his first starring role and he does a great job at it. Radha Mitchell is his on screen wife who also gives us a sympathetic role with some actual acting in her performance. Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker are the remaining two "main" actors here, the former giving a crazy but good performance while the latter gives us a generic whimpering teen.It's also good to know the craftsmanship also went to the look of the film as it did the script. I love the cinematography with its gracefulness, giving the film a stylish look and the soundtrack by Mark Isham is really heartfelt. And it's great to see director Breck Eisner get back to his feet after the box office bomb SAHARA. If you're wondering if the film has the social commentary contained in almost every George A. Romero film, you need not worry here. It's done in such a way the filmmakers did not push it down our throats.Overall, this is how every horror movies should be, let alone remakes, although they aren't, which still remains to us a great mystery. There are some great and ingenious sequences in here along with tension and suspense. The gore is actually used sparingly, although when it does get used, it's really nasty. It's just a really bloody horror flick with intelligence and good film-making. Films like THE CRAZIES give us hope to the slowly dying horror genre. Let's hope Hollywood makes more movies like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A predictable, but fun ride.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There isn't much good coming out of Hollywood horror these days. Most of the good horror films end up on the independent market or come in a foreign package, but even then, the list of good horror films these days is short and thin. So, it's a bit surprising to find myself saying the The Crazies is actually a decent bit of Hollywood horror. Albeit, it is a remake, but it runs more in the vein of the Dawn of the Dead remake than the Friday the 13th. The Crazies is pretty predictable and is fairly standard fare. Small town essentially does the zombie thing (they might as well be zombies, though seeing the people act crazy is kinda fun), there is a shoot- first, never answer questions military cover up, and our heroes face off against all said threats. Most horror film clichés are thrown in and there are very few surprises. Yet the film remains entertaining, partly due to the great cinematography, but mostly due to it's lead cast, predominantly Timothy Olyphant. He continues to prove that he is one of this generations best new character actors with another great role that will probably end up going mostly unnoticed. He plays the hero to a T, and does a great job every minute of it. Suffice to say, he is the most enjoyable aspect of this film. Rhada Mitchell also continues to prove herself as a fine actress who deserves more notice. She puts up a near equally good performance in her semi-heroine role, tackling some very physical aspects. The films real downfall is it's pacing issues. Its initial pace is pretty speedy, with the story moving through quite a bit within the first 50 minutes. After this mark, things start to slow down. There are some decent set pieces, including a great car wash scene and a decent truck stop scene, but I kept wondering if we had reached the climax already. I had to look at my watch a few times just to see if the film was too short or not. It also didn't help that most of the horror gimmicks, though somewhat effective, had been seen before. This also kind of slowed down the film as little.All in all, The Crazies is a good weekend at the cinema in a weekend of few notable movies. If you're looking for something more Hollywood and entertaining, The Crazies should suffice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, look, we need Hollywood to engage in a 10 year moratorium on making ANY more Zombie movies, and that includes Zombies who are just people infected with some horrible disease. At least not unless they can FINALLY come up with an original idea.The Crazies is a paint-by-numbers effort, with all the usual clichés, shambling ZOmbies who can find the characters wherever they go, shadowy government agents, etc.Did Hollywood not get the Memo. Hope and Change. The government isn't the bad guy anymore. Seriously, they are ready to crucify Obama over an oil leak, you think he'd get away with nuking a small town in Iowa. (Well, I mean, it wasn't even a red state last time out!) Okay, short plot, a plane carrying a bioweapon goes down over Iowa, and the townsfolk start acting in a psychotic manner. Nice guy small town sheriff Timothy Olyphant (Guy, you were great in Deadwood, what happened?) blunders between Zombies trying to kill him and government troops trying to kill him.Oh, yeah. And never do he and his doctor wife say, "Hey, we might be infected after having infected zombies breathe and bleed all over us. Maybe we should do the sensible thing and NOT put anyone else at risk." Enough Zombie Movies. Until you come up with something original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Don't Drink The Water (-- OR ELSE!?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a quiet time in Pierce County, Iowa, as a baseball game is played in the small town of Ogden Marsh (whose population is under 2000 people). All of a sudden, a man enters the outfield carrying a shotgun. Sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant) recognizes the man as being a onetime drunk, &amp; goes out to ask him in a nice way to lower his gun. The man just stares ahead catatonicly, raises the gun-- &amp; Timothy feels compelled to shoot him (causing great upset to the man's wife &amp; son, which comes into play later in the film)? ? Strangely, OTHER people (like a baseball coach) soon start going into similar sort of trances, accompanied by blood flowing from their nose &amp; then followed by horribly VIOLENT acts against others... Timothy &amp; his deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson) grow increasingly disturbed by what is happening, &amp; run around trying to confront the strange actions that keep breaking out? ? Timothy's wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) is a doctor who herself has seen the frightening changes in a number of people, having just examined some who become mixed up in a fire at a farm involving Bill Farnum (Brett Rickaby)? ? Since she's pregnant, Timothy is especially protective of Radha, and becomes increasingly concerned in his inability to discover just what is CAUSING people to behave like uncontrolled maniacs, altho it seems to be connected to something concerning the water the town has been drinking? ? Instead of things improving, they go from bad to HORRENDOUS, with the sudden arrival of a mass of MILITARY people who round up the townspeople &amp; work to force them to undergo some unexplained tests? They start to engage in some summary executions, and Timothy, Joe, Radha and Becca Darling (Danielle Panabaker) work to escape from the soldiers &amp; try to get somewhere safe? ? Those trying to escape keep running into people who seem to be adversely affected by the mysterious toxin, having to fight from farm to car wash to truck stop with individuals, a group of hunters, and more military people wearing gas-type masks? The confrontations are exceptionally bloody &amp; gory, &amp; certainly not for kids? ? Who are the military people, &amp; what are they trying to "accomplish"?? What is the CAUSE of the sudden violence by people?? WHO will get "AWAY" at the end, &amp; how will they accomplish it?? ? The film has a fine level of TENSION, &amp; would be a quite fascinating "thriller" if is wasn't so hell-bent on BEING Hell-bent: rather than focus on the environmental disaster impacting the people &amp; the strange over-reaction by the "authorities", it concentrates on being grotesquely GORY, massively MALIGNANT &amp; violently VICIOUS in the actions of most of the people? ? Some audiences like that level of blood &amp; guts being senselessly spilled; I'd rather they had the guts to NOT be so extreme, &amp; instead concentrated on a better-developed level of more detailed storytelling? ? One friend who saw it commented he was disappointed in the way there was so little real "PLOT" inherent in the film-- but, I don't tend to EXPECT much of that in "slasher" flicks? The ACTING was good by the main characters, &amp; the tense "mood" was effective? But, it could have been so much "MORE" (&amp; simply didn't care to be, seemingly going for a "lower" un-common denominator)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a government airplane carrying a biological weapon crashes into a small Iowa town, the virus infects many of the towns population causing them to become psychotic. Now a small handful of uninfected must work to survive and make it out of the town before they become the next victims.The Crazies is a remake of the 1973 George Romero classic "The Crazies." Luckily, George Romero was producer on this film as well and it shows. Fans of the original will find much to enjoy in this one as well. The basic plot is the same, but also different enough that it is worth seeing. The acting is very well done. The pace and feel of the film is just perfect for setting up a tense and thrilling ride. Also, the film is more about creating tense and frightening scenes without shoving tons of gore in your face. For fans of horror this is definitely worth a watch.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is everything I could expect from a movie, this one is great. The movies gets going right away with the baseball scene. After this everything starts off, people turning crazy. I think the movie gets best when they are trying to get out of the town. This turns it into an Action/Adventure movie also. Their were a lot of scenes that were excellent some that I would point out would be the Funeral home, Pitchfork, Nursery and Car Wash scenes. I do not want to get much away. SPOILERS: The ending was my favorite part of the movie, the struggle between the Crazies in the truck stop place was very intense. Then they hear that countdown. After that the huge nuke happens. This is a very awesome scene with the truck getting hit by it. Overall this is a movie I would highly recommend for people that like a good Horror/Action movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just when you think you've seen enough survivalist zombie flicks, here comes another---and not surprisingly, an unassuming remake of George Romero's 1973 b-movie cult classic of the same name.This remake however, is quite a top-notch fright fest with just enough "WTF" ambiguity to satisfy hardcore sci-fi fans of the Comic-Con generation, and with enough blood and guts to satiate the average frat boy demographic who just can't get enough of the torture-porn horror movies of late. The "same-old, same-old" plot notwithstanding, the execution here is clever and inventive enough to generate genuine seat-sinking moments of dread and suspense. To use a well-tuned sports sedan as a metaphor---think, for example an early model Acura TSX--- it is by design a fun car to drive (action), with just the right amount of power (plot twists), useful gadgets (actors), standard features (CGI and makeup) and to top it off having all components and panels fitting together just right (editing and visuals). Relating further to fancier model cars with all the stupefying bells, whistles and 'bling' that elevate things to the "whoa, cool!" stratosphere, this one takes a conservative and rather defiant approach to a tired and true horror genre and makes it all fresh and alive. Well, at least for now.The cast is pitch-perfect. Timothy Olyphant has just enough aw-shucks good looks and bravado to make him both likable and believable as the small-town sheriff. Radha Mitchell, who was terrific although underutilized in a recent sci-fi flick called "Surrogates," has taken on the woman in peril role to new heights as the sheriff's pregnant wife. In what would otherwise be a thankless role, she does succeed in her extended freak and scream moments that would have made Jamie Lee Curtis proud! Like "28 Days Later" and even as far back as the original "The Hills Have Eyes," this remake of "The Crazies" is a winner in every way. Put it down as a purchase once it's released on home video, and display it proudly amongst the rest of your zombie and torture porn DVD collection!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brutal, Sadistic Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene shows small town America, Ogden Marsh, engulfed in a fiery blaze. This is a small town with apple pie values. How did it get this way? The answer is uncovered by David, (Timothy Olyphant) the town's sheriff. On a typical day the citizens gather 'round the bases. One day the town drunk brings a rifle to the park. David tries to diffuse the situation, but has to draw his firearm and kill the man. Soon, more mysteries, homicidal behavior hits the area. David's pregnant wife Jody (Radha Mitchell), witnesses how her zoned out patients become murders. Eventually, our heroes find that a government-designed pathogen has polluted the town's water supply. Naturally the Army gets involved, putting David and Jody in the race of their lives.Though there have been more graphically violent recent films, The Crazies pulls few punches. Actually, the horrors it doesn't show play on the imagination of the audience; sparing us the on-screen melting of children in the least. Regardless, there is plenty of gruesome imagery whether or not you believe a virus can make someone methodically murder.As David and Jody try to escape, they find friends and enemies. This is a well-conceived concept for the film to play with since many of the early docile citizens reappear as crazed killers. I am privy to the intel that this is a remake, but Netflix wasn't able to fetch me a copy of the George A. Romero original. Thus, I don't know how much is from the input of director Breck Eisner. Presented with notable cinematography, strong acting, and effective use of music, it's difficult to imagine a better film dealing with this particular situation. That's not to say that The Crazies is perfect?far from it.Whenever there is a remake, there is a Panabaker. This time around we have the older sister, Danielle. She basically does her routine from the Platinum Dunes production of Friday the 13th. It's an adequate supporting performance, but certainly pales in comparison to Joe Anderson's. As deputy Russell, he captures the mark between rural and hillbilly in a way that doesn't stereotype. Doesn't hurt that the characters are written to display a range of emotions since the virus makes them questions each other's sanity.The Crazies is one of those special movies where a few calls near the end make you change your mind. One of the obvious plot twists becomes a political statement. It could maybe even be considered bad taste for the movie to draw comparisons with Nazi death camps. One shot, that makes it apparent, shows hands sticking out of a trailer made to look like a railcar from Schindler's List. Factoring in predictability and a weak conclusion can certainly make The Crazies a downer. Fact is that the majority of the film works well within its means; for that, those of you with interest in The Crazies will have a brutal, sadistic time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Bad, but could've been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake of The Crazies was a good enough film for the most part. The acting was decent and the scares pretty good. The pacing was real good and keeps your interest throughout, but I think it needed a little more mounting tension. It starts out well, but becomes more of a shock fest near the end, and that takes away some of the movie's power.After a quick scene of a small town burning at the beginning, we are pointed to two days prior where a baseball game is being played. One of the local residents, looking very much off, walks onto the field with a shotgun, and the local sheriff (Timothy Olyphant) steps forward after telling everybody to take cover. Trouble ensues and suddenly a small once peaceful town is thrown into a nightmare that they can't escape. You see, something has contaminated the water supply, and it causes people to go insane and start killing one another. How this all comes about, I will not say, but the town sheriff, his pregnant wife (Radha Mitchell), the sheriff's deputy (Joe Anderson), and a town friend (Danielle Panabaker) try to survive and make their way to the next town in hopes that it is not infected, but things aren't that easy, as our four protagonists soon find out.Following in the footsteps of 28 Days later and 28 Weeks later, The Crazies is a movie about normal human beings becoming bloodthirsty maniacs after a virus has infected them. The Crazies is not on the same world scale as those first two movies, but the infected, just like those first two movies, are not really zombies at all, but just sick people. All three movies are metaphors on the real world and what it has become. Both 28 Days Later and 28 weeks later ratcheted the tension up and then hit us with the shocks. THe Crazies starts out in much the same vain but the tension is more like a whimper, and then the shocks happen. Of course this movie does contain a car wash scene that could put it right up there with the first two movies, but then little else happens to match that one scene.As I said, the acting is pretty good for a horror movie. You do care about what happens to our four heroes as they make their way through this nightmarish landscape. Some have said their wasn't much chemistry between the husband and wife, but when you're trying to survive, some of that marital affection might just get thrown out the window.My beef with the film was not the acting, nor the pacing, or even the gore and shocks which were very effective when used. What I felt after seeing this movie was that I was not scared enough, or even creep-ed out that much. Gore is good and all, as are simple shocks to jar you, but a good or great horror movie has to have more suspense. The Crazies didn't have enough of that. I will admit that it is better than most other horror movies put out recently, but I can't quite give it my recommendation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rare Remake That's Better Than The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remake is one of the most dreaded things in horror today. With a few exceptions (like the "Dawn of the Dead" remake), most remakes tend to either a.) Add nothing new or exciting to the equation, or b.) Going the safe, PG-13 route. So when it was announced that Michael Eisner's son Breck was directing a remake of George A. Romero's 1973 film "The Crazies", I was more than a little skeptical. I mean, the original, while a good movie, isn't exactly one of Romero's best works, so the idea of remaking it was no skin off of my back. It was just the choice of director that irked me. Thankfully, Eisner got it right, not only doing a remake that improves upon the original, but also manages to be one of the much better horror remakes.In the town of Ogden Marsh, Iowa, a plane crash has caused a bio-weapon known as "Trixie" to leak into the water supply. Said chemical has a noticeable side effect-it causes people to turn insane and commit acts of violence and murder. So what does the government do? The send in the military to control the situation. This isn't exactly an easy epidemic to contain however, and sheriff David Dutton (Timothy Olyphant), his pregnant wife Judy (Radha Mitchell) and two others (Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker) soon realize that the so called "Crazies" might not be the biggest threat.Eisner's version of "The Crazies" has two things going for it that even Romero's original didn't-good performances and actual scares. Everyone involved-particularly Olyphant and Mitchell-does a fine job with the material, never going over the top or overacting, and helping add some weight and reality to the situation at hand. At the same time, this is a tense little movie, as Eisner pulls off several suspenseful set pieces that constantly get the job done effectively, the highlight being a scene in a car wash. Oh, and there's a really fun cameo appearance from the originals own Lynn Lowery, herself something of a cult icon.One thing this movie and the original get right is an intelligent social commentary on government incompetence. Government's all over the world have tried to deal with serious situations in unnecessarily violent manners, so the idea of the government violently mishandling a situation isn't the least bit shocking-look at things such as the Iraq War and especially Guantanamo Bay for example.In the end, "The Crazies" is the rare remake that get's the job done, and manages to actually improve on the original. It's surprising to see Hollywood of all things be the ones who got it right, but at least someone did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a Graduate Student from UC Berkeley, and on behalf of all Berkeley we protest this utter trash of a movie! First off, what kind of a cruel world do we live in that allows Micheal Eisner's loin child to remake historic or cultural films? Horrible, excessively violent and historically unsupportable. Please don't support this film and allow Mr. Gibson to spread whatever mantra he believes in. But hey, it's a free world isn't it? At the end, my wife and I looked at each other and said 'What was the point of that?' The gore is graphic in the extreme, without any redeeming value whatsoever. (For example, I would say the violence in 'Saving Private Ryan' was about as bad, but in the context of the plot it made sense.) This doesn't. You've just got some evil villains coming in and slaughtering the peaceful villagers, sadistic villains torturing the prisoners, and crazed priests eviscerating the human sacrifices.I would like to thank Eisner Jr. for making me do nightmares, and take pills of Xanax to calm down from all the anxiety this film caused in me. Thank you very much for bringing such fear I didn't want in my life. This film should have been banned. I've never ever in my life seen such free cruelty on the screen.Thank you again for not showing it on the trailer, so that people couldn't know in advance it's much more than an "action" movie... it's a butchery. I hope Eisner Jr. does "sweeter" next time, or else I'll think twice before watching his movie. I really don't advise this film to anyone, it will traumatize you. I really found that movie useless, and much more than a waste of time... a total lack of respect towards the audience's eyes. What's the point of making a whole film about violence? It's completely inhuman!!! Totally lacking of sensitivity, describing the wonderful zombie vs civilization theme as undead people just made for eating human flesh, killing and reproducing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George A. Romero, the king of the zombies, or at least zombie movies. This man has made some incredible pieces of horror that constantly leave us with nightmares and a new perspective on society and our behavior. Dawn of the Dead was remade a few years ago and was one of the best remakes you could see, it had a lot of respect for the original and didn't over step it's boundaries. The Crazies is a little bit of a lesser known film, but if you're a Romero fan, you know the movie obviously. But I checked out The Crazies when it was first released and was a little puzzled, not so sure what I thought about it afterwards. I had to really think this review over, because obviously the idea is a great one, not to mention very haunting. A small town where pretty much everyone knows EVERYTHING about you, everyone is very close, all of a sudden they are struck with a disease that is causing them to go into a killing spree. Having to decide who is sick and who's not, making it out of a town that is surrounded by the government who does not want anyone to make it out alive was brutal to watch. I think that's what had thrown me off was how uncomfortable the whole plot made me because if this situation was real, the film handled it in the best way possible, as realistic as they could.Judy Dutton finishes paperwork at the local hospital alongside employee Becca Darling while her husband, Sheriff David Dutton, enjoys a local high school baseball game. Dutton's deputy, Russell Clank, spots Rory Hamill, a resident entering the outfield with a gun. David tries to get him to drop his weapon but is forced to shoot and kill Rory. David and Judy begin to notice strange behavior in other town residents; they are slow to respond to questions and repetitive in their answers. The next night, Bill Farnum a local farmer kills his wife Deardra and son Nicholas. David and Russell investigate a dead soldier who is found in the woods and eventually find a crashed plane that has leaked a toxin into the water supply. Infected residents become extremely aggressive, attacking and killing other people. David tries to convince Judy to leave town but they are captured by soldiers and taken to a temporary military facility at the high school. Meanwhile, David escapes from a group of people being released and rejoins Russell. The two go to the high school and get there to save Judy and Becca, the group begins walking out of town, hiding from both the infected and the military along the way.The actors work very well together, I'm glad we don't have the "big name" actors in this remake, so it doesn't take away from the plot and makes it a little more gritty. There are also some incredibly scary scenes, I'm not a big fan of the "jump scares" as the movie does use plenty of those and it does lose a few points on that, but there is a scene where they're caught in a car wash where these "zombies" are attacking our leads while they can't clearly see where they stand and how they will attack. There is a scene that I loved but didn't make much sense, we have the wife walk into her baby room where right behind her are some neighbors that have the disease, not fully transformed yet, but somehow in the next scene she's tied up very quickly, didn't understand how that could have happened. But over all, despite a few flaws, the film works very well and is very gritty. It's a good remake that is going to leave you with a few nightmares.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weaker than the original, but I still thought it was decent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to be one of the few people who really loves George A. Romero's original 1973 film The Crazies, but, I have to say, a remake wasn't a totally bad idea. The original is very well written and directed, but the awful acting is off-putting, and I understand why most people wouldn't care for it. I actually didn't think this remake improved much in that department. Timothy Olyphant and Radha Mitchell star as a married couple trying to get out of an Iowa town being torn to shreds by a mysterious virus and the invasion of the U.S. military. Joe Anderson and Danielle Panabaker accompany them. Anderson and Panabaker are decent (Panabaker is adorable), but Olyphant and Mitchell are low B-level stars and neither of them brings much to the table. I thought Olyphant was kind of bad, really. I mean, it's not the amateurish acting of the original, but it isn't much better. The film itself is pretty good for a modern horror film. It lacks the complexity of the original one. They drop the military and medical points of view entirely, and instead just focus on the fugitives trying to get outside the perimeter. That idea to focus the film is kind of a good idea (I would assume the people backing it didn't want to confuse a young audience with social commentary), but with a more singleminded focus, the film does become a tad repetitive. It is saved by a handful of excellent horror sequences. I loved the opening bit, with the crazed gunman walking onto a high school baseball field with a shotgun. And there's a sequence set in a carwash that will go down as one of the great horror sequences. Carwashes are so claustrophobic as it is, it just works brilliantly. This film is definitely worth a rental at least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the rare, effective remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one solid, action laced, intense, entertaining thrill ride of a remake done right for once! Everything about this is great from the acting, filming, shocks, mystery, gore, pace and story that I didn't want it to end, a sign of a terrific thriller in my books. There were a few solid jump scares here and there but this is more of an apocalyptic/thriller than a full out horror movie to me but the gripping action and the gnarly situation make up for that because to me these type of virus, apocalypse films are more terrifying than some guy in a mask chasing bimbos around. This was like a mixture of Carriers, 28 Weeks Later, Resident Evil, Phantoms etc. so if you like any of those films you'll love this wild and crazy ride. I can't find any flaws about this movie other than the fact that it's not the most original movie around but it's a remake so who care because I'd take a good remake any day than some watered down crap! Overall I loved it and didn't want it to end and would mind a sequel and this might even be the best thriller or horror movie I guess we'll see this year but hopefully not. Highly recommended but then again I have a soft spot for these type of movies. More of a 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Production; Lousy Script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm almost ashamed to say that I've never seen the Romero original, so I'm going into 'The Crazies' totally blind. On the whole, it's a better movie than many recent remakes. The generic script, riddled with genre clichés, is thankfully salvaged (in part) by director Breck Eisner. He has a visual flare and a sympathetic approach to characters and location that lifts the movie above its drive-in origins. The tension is built with some success in several scenes, though it's too-often cut short before it reaches nerve-wracking heights. The Crazies themselves are barely-glimpsed, and on the rare occasion we get to see them they are disappointing carbon copies of every madness-inducing virus victim thrown up in the last ten years. Though the film carries an R certificate, there's little on screen to warrant the rating, and the violence and brutality necessary to make these guys truly terrifying is sadly missing. The primary problem, however, is a screenplay that never manages to convey any real sense of urgency. Characters seem free to wander aimlessly at will and the Crazies are so small in number as to be easily avoided. Imagine '28 Days Later' with barely a dozen Infected in the city and you get the idea. As such, there's rarely any sense of immediate danger. The film is entertaining and Eisner and his cast can't be praised enough for their attempts to boost a dull screenplay into something of quality (hence my rating). It's just a shame that newcomers Overture Films seems to share the disregard that more established production companies have for horror and scupper their product from the outset by hiring hack writers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprising...Tense and Gritty...Not Your Standard Horror Flic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this movie with a group of friends, thinking this movie would be but another clichéd and dull horror film that the Hollywood machine has been churning out lately, but I am delighted to say that this movie, rather than disappoint, exceeded my expectations.Director Breck Eisner's The Crazies remains unlike so many horror flics in that a genuine tension pervades the entirety of the film. There is rarely a dull moment or slack in the tension. This tension exists largely because Eisner develops the main characters, the Sheriff (Olyphant), his wife Julie (Mitchell) and his deputy (Anderson), causing the viewer to care if they live or die. Additionally, the actors also surpass the acting echelon normally associated with a horror film.The refreshing aspect of this film remains its unpredictability. Unlike most horror movies, no nudity or sex pervades the film, implied or otherwise. Furthermore, the sequencing of who lives and who dies, how, when, and if they die, remains non-formulaic. In a normal horror movie, you might see death's predictable plan, laugh at the character's stupidity, and watch them die. However, The Crazies breaks this paradigm. Characters die or are threatened by death in unexpected scenes and methods. Even the foreshadowing occasionally misleads, creating a greater sense of tension.Regarding the film's gore, this film does not disappoint. There is a great deal of macabre imagery and gritty detail throughout the film, yet the extent of the gore does not feel gratuitous or ridiculous.The combination of these different elements coalesces to create great tension throughout the film. Although there are some moments of comic relief, the director does an excellent job of avoiding unwanted laughter during moments of suspense. During one particularly tense scene, I was actually inching up and backward in my seat, as if trying to scoot backward to escape the impending infliction that rushed toward one character (if you have seen the film you'll know which scene).Collectively, I would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a good horror film. While this is not the type of film that will haunt you long after you've left the theater, it provides excellent tension throughout its duration. It's a roller-coaster ride; just enjoy it and go!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Zombie flicks are becoming far too over exposed. The film "Zombieland" had a good run making fun of this fact. The central premise of this film has been done many times already. But what makes this film better than most is the strength of the acting. Timothy Olyphant was great in the lead role. Radha Mitchell plays his wife. They are stuck in a small town in Iowa suffering the after effects of a military accident.Is this like most other Zombie movies? Yes. But is it good and worth checking out? Absolutely. This was a very well written, acted, directed, and filmed horror flick. I had a good time watching it. I wish I could say the same for my Wife. Poor thing couldn't take it &amp; walked out.

		<shortDescription>Solid but not outstanding. Gave me nightmares! :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Crazies is a remake of a film that was once original, but these days zombie films are a dime a dozen. Does The Crazies stand out?I felt it to be a solid film but one that did not come across as overly original. However, just when I was thinking, "this is going to be pretty formulaic", there was a plot twist involving outsiders that changed the entire nature of the film. Unfortunately, this new premise was never explored or explained fully enough to build tension. If we don't know what the protagonists are fighting against, and therefore what their goal is, how much can we root for them?Although people have called this film a commentary on environmental damage and pollutants -- the thing that causes the Zombies -- isn't fleshed out enough to be a real talking point of the film. Anger and fear of the government don't constitute political commentary, I'm sorry. Also, there's confusion as to whether it's really a pollutant or more like a virus that is contagious. If it's contagious, it is a good thing that the protagonists want to escape the zombies and possibly infect the world?To its credit, there is plenty of action, and the action sequences play into the drama. There's some random violence, but most of the conflicts build character development and push the characters even further into terror and desperation. The film also avoids superhuman stunts. There's no MacGuyver or Keanu Reaves type in the film who knows exactly what to do and makes the film too campy to be scary.That being said, the action scenes aren't overly original. And the power of the big bang ending is wasted, neither being adequately built up nor adequately used as an obstacle to be overcome. The tension in the scene of crossing the highway is sort of wasted as well. And I do wish movieland people driving dangerously would fasten their seat belts. All in all, The Crazies is a solid film that really did give me a nightmare. I'll give it a respectable but not classic 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, and right before the Oscars, right? I'd be willing to place a modest wager that the attendees and nominees of the 82nd Annual Academy Awards are thanking their boots that this movie isn't included in the 82nd Oscar circuit. But I'd only place a modest wager because I'm not usually much into gambling.The film follows three 30-somethings living "the rural life." But the country roads, hay rides, and good old fashioned apple pie (the REAL America as I like to think of it) isn't all fun and games when a mysterious thing happens to the town (you'll have to watch the movie to find out what exactly, but I will tell you this much--it's "crazy" LOL).My favorite surprise was the leading lady, Judy. As a first-trimester pregnant character, she showed us once again that you don't need to be a size zero to be a star in Hollywood. Thank you, Judy!So when this crew of crazy 30-somethings finds out there has been some sort of outbreak, the story gets even crazier. (lol). You'll have to tune in at your local theater to find out what happens next. Toodles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I was being thoroughly entertained by this movie I kept thinking to myself that something bad is going to happen and this movie will take a turn for the worse or get boring or stupid or something. Luckily for me, it didn't, and the result is one of the best horror movies I've seen in quite some time. The Crazies has the perfect blend of horror and humor. It takes off right from the very beginning and never lets up. It's scary, violent, and very fun.Normally I'm a huge gore fanatic. The more gore, the happier I am (as in Wrong Turn 2). While this movie does have its share of gore, it's not excessive and, in my opinion, is just enough to satisfy even my greedy needs. The highlight of this film is its pacing. Scene after intense scene you are never left waiting for something to happen. The film comes at you full speed and is very gripping. One moment I was tense and on the edge of my seat, the next I was laughing, but never once was I bored or left wanting more. When I can say that about a horror movie (my favorite genre), it's always going to be high on my list. Absolutely see this movie! 9.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I thought this would be just another zombie movie...how wrong I was. I was surprisingly impressed by this movie. They waste no time in getting to the core of the plot, then little by little they explain what's going on. It keeps you interested while not making you wait 2 hours to know what the heck is going on. There's more than just slashing and screaming, but a forewarning that there are about a dozen jump-out-of-your-seat scenes. And of course, like any good horror flick, it leaves you with that last "aw man!" scene. What makes this horror flick different from most is that it's actually realistic and feasible. Once the story unfolds, it's scary how this could really happen and how people would be "handled" in the process. It's well cast with convincing effects. Worth the $9 definitely!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>F-n Awesome !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i have only minor spoilers here, so read with no fear..I have not seen original movie, and so i'm judging 2010 Crazies on its own merit. The trailer looked promising, but i've also seen the Cop Out's trailer, and what a pile of garbage that is ! As we all know long time ago movie studios figured out how to cut a cool trailer for a totally hopeless flick, and have fooled all of us countless number of times since then.. what i'm trying to say is that i had certain reservations regarding Crazies, particularly given that decent zombiesque production is so rare, the last good serious American zombie movie was Dawn of the Dead, and that was 2004, right ? (i am not counting Zombieland, which was terrific, but is pretty much a comedy) The Crazies is awesome. Period. It had by far exceeded my expectations, and the next day i realized it is up there in the zombie hall fame along with 28 Days Later (with a twist of 28 Weeks Later).. OK, may be it is not as good as 28 Days that was a masterpiece on many levels as well as the groundbreaking movie for this genre (fast-running zombies ? who'd think ! changes all the rules of engagement, doesn't it ?), but it offers you equally honest and violent insight into the psyche of evil..The Crazies has an average running time, but seemed long to me ('good' long, not 'bad' long) because they managed to fill the plot with so much content, and it constantly gives you something new..The movie opens with a scene of destroyed burning street of a small town, and you kind of think that this is how the movie will end, they gave you a glimpse of final mayhem, and now you'll see how it all came to this. But there is so much more there than one small town biting the dust.. and the burning street is just the half-time..There is the zombified murderous population, love and friendship constantly tested by deteriorating world, subtle social commentary, breakdown of civil order, inhumane, but somewhat understandable actions of military, large-scale quarantine, militia-type rednecks on a killing spree, and much more.. Main characters are constantly facing new enemies, and that makes Crazies way more entertaining than Dawn of the Dead.. and unlike most of zombie movies (including Dawn of the Dead) The Crazies gives you the perfectly plausible and logical explanation of why everything went total fricken bananas, and as far as i am concerned everything that you will see in the movie could happen tomorrow in our everyday real life, we just don't know what is sleeping out there in the dark..The movie is very intense, more than once you'll jump in you seat. It's well shot, all the visuals are solid and uncompromising.Unlike many zombie movies it does not suffer from the lack of budget and necessity to cut corners, it all feels real. The military, the biohazard troops, special forces - all look authentic and downright evil in their well planned but futile attempt to stop the spread of insanity, and they only fuel the fire.I gave The Cazies 10 stars, because there is nothing that i would change or improve if i could. It is realistic, persuasive, action-packed and thought-provoking look at how it all may end.. i just hope we are all more lucky than this..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surely this should have been crazier?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Crazies" isn't just yet another remake of a classic horror gem, it's also yet another horror film in which the zombies aren't in fact zombies but people infected with a virus. Back in 1973, when the legendary George A. Romero thought it up for his movie, this was still an incredibly original twist, but before the remake reached us there also was "28 Days Later", "REC", "Ponytool", "Carriers", etc? Basically you could state that the "The Crazies" was ripped off multiple times before it got remade and hence this updated version is even more pointless and redundant than all the other remakes out there. Oh well, perhaps this is all just a little too skeptical and I nevertheless wanted to give "The Crazies" the benefit of the doubt when I went to see it at the Brussels International Festival of Fantastic Films, together with a theater full of wildly enthusiast horror fanatics. The film has quite a few things going for it, like a strong cast and the support of Romero as a producer, but I never at one point felt this was a good movie. There honestly isn't that much going on in "The Crazies", especially not in comparison to the original. That movie depicted mass hysteria and paranoia at its most intense. Romero confused even the viewer by not letting us know properly which characters were infected and which ones weren't. For all we know, they could all simply be trigger-happy Pennsylvanian hillbillies, and still most of movie's menacing atmosphere came from those anonymous but hyper-creepy military men dressed in white suits and their face covered by gas masks. This new version sadly just seems to revolve on one young couple, David and Judy Dutton and their unborn baby, trying to escape from their deadly infected hometown. He's the sheriff and she's the doctor of a little Iowa town called Ogden Marsh, when suddenly some of the friendly locals begin to behave like emotionless psychopaths that set fire to their own houses and show up at the Sunday morning baseball game with a shotgun in their hands. Next thing we know a couple of fishermen stumble upon a crashed down military aircraft in the swamp and suddenly the little town is overrun with soldiers that are gathering all the Ogden Marsh inhabitants to put under quarantine. David and a small group of survivors discover that the town's water supply got contaminated with a secret government supported virus called Trixie and that nobody has a proper idea of the exact impact and consequences. When they realize they can't save their fellow citizens, the only thing left for David and Judy to do is run for their lives. "The Crazies" is never boring, contains a few very likable characters and features a notable amount of suspense and splatter, but still the film is too ? decent! This is another horror movie intended for the modern day and mainstream target audiences, with an overly politically correct script and too little shock-value. Perhaps I'm just a nagging old-fashioned horror geek, but this is a wondrous example of a remake that completely lacks the gritty, nihilistic, disturbing and raw atmosphere that was so common in the early 1970's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A completely worthwhile remake, it was CRAZY.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tonight I saw the remake of 1973 film "The Crazies" and it was, actually, insane.Set in a small town in Iowa 'The Crazies' is not your typical zombie film, in fact zombies doesn't really describe the infected delights of this town. Using the traditional, 'widespread, contagious virus' set-up the storyline has the basis to be incredibly clichéd, and whilst it does have one of those really, you survived that? moments, it also has a fascinating level of realism. The actors, primarily Timothy Olyphant, Radha Mitchell and Joe Anderson perform with a surprising amount of conviction making the film more horrifying than a majority of others in the genre. The screenplay (Romero, Scott Koser and Ray White) also meant that the characters were believable and allowed for a surprising amount of empathy, and for once I wasn't left begging for them to hurry up and die already.The cinematography was an odd mix of wonderful composition, ripped straight from art house sustained shots and conventional Hollywood action shots. Combining this with some pretty impressive special effects, (realistic fire is always a plus in films) used in some pretty innovative ways it makes the film absorbing to watch.The only bit I'm unsure of is the soundtrack; it's either really cutting-edge, or really contrived depending on how you like your horror. This isn't a big enough deal to have any real impact on the film. The film could also have a bit more gore, not that I wasn't clutching my stomach at some points (the make-up is pretty impressive).Overall, this incredible film pretty much has everything, including some irony and some unexpected twists making it 101 minutes well spent. Oh, and try to say for the full time, because when you think it's over, it's not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Crazies, The (2010) ** (out of 4)By-the-numbers remake of George Romero's 1973 film has a small town being invaded by some military men when a plane crashes and unleashes some toxic waste that is turning people into "crazies". The Sheriff (Timothy Olyphant), his wife (Radha Mitchell) and the deputy (Joe Anderson) try to avoid capture and get out of town before being struck with the virus. I'd be lying if I said I was a fan of the original film and in many ways I wasn't overly thrilled with 28 DAYS LATER, which in itself was pretty much a remake. This film here has quite a few good moments but the lackluster direction really killed the film for me and by the hour mark I was started to squirm in my seat from boredom and the final forty-minutes weren't any better. I was really disappointed because the film started off pretty well with the first appearance of a "crazy" being handled quite well. The rest of the movie went downhill even though a couple of the cast members tried their best to save it. This follows the original film pretty closely, although there's no question that Romero did a much better job considering the budget he was working with and at least his screenplay managed to do a few good things. This film has one rather dumb character after another doing one stupid thing after another but the entire screenplay is basically just a "copy what worked in previous movies". There's not a single original idea on display here and Eisner's direction really doesn't bring anything to life. He keeps the film looking professional but any director of this type of film should at least be able to do that. Each scene has violence, drama or some sort of gore but there's no passion or life behind it. It's just there on the screen, bland and not too involving. I thought Olyphant made for an interesting leading man and I thought he tried very hard to keep everything moving. He was certainly much better than the material as was Anderson as his sidekick. I really didn't care for Mitchell at all; her performance and character were annoying to me. The film follows just about every twist and turn you'd expect and in the end there's really nothing much here. It's certainly far from a bad movie but at the same time it's not a very good one either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Crazies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1973 film from director George A. Romero (writing and producing for this) was a terrible sidetrack from his successful Living Dead zombie films, I was quite interested to see if they could improve it, from director Breck Eisner (Sahara). Basically Ogden Marsh is a small quiet town in Iowa, the only disturbance recently was when Sheriff David Dutten (Timothy Olyphant) was forced to kill an unresponsive Rory Hamill (Mike Hickman) holding a gun at a high school baseball game. Investigating a pilot's body reported dead in the swamp, David finds the cargo plane he as flying submerged in the water, they may have unintentionally found something lethal. Soon enough communication is completely down, and the town has become more quiet than usual, that is because soldiers have arrived to take all residents into contamination. Everyone is going in to be examined for symptoms of infection, due to the use of the water supply, and those with a very high temperature are most likely infected. David and his doctor wife Judy (Surrogates' Radha Mitchell) get separated because of her high temperature due to her being pregnant, and while travelling for evacuation David manages to escape with Deputy Russell Clank (Joe Anderson). The virus, created for military purposes, is turning people into insane psychopathic killers, zombie-like beings with no thoughts or consciousness, apart from killing anyone they see. David and Russell rescue Judy and hospital assistant Becca Darling (Sky High's Danielle Panabaker) from the "creatures" and the non-caring soldiers, and they are just going wherever they can to get away from the devastation. All the vehicles have been cut off from use, but the ones they do find don't last very long, and they also have a near capture when Becca wants them to get her boyfriend Scotty McGregor (Justin Miles), who ends up shot and burnt to death with his mother (Marian Green). Even though they have all been drinking or using the water full of the infection, it is obvious that Russell is giving into it the quickest as his stress levels rise, and he says he saved David twice, and he eventually sacrifices himself to let the other two get away. David and Judy manage to find a working vehicle, and with a walkie-talkie radio they hear that even the people uninfected have been killed, and there is a countdown to something happening, so they race to get out of town fast. The countdown ends and the town explodes in a mushroom cloud, causing the truck to flip, but David and Judy crawl out and look back at the explosion, and the film ends with them walking towards the town of Cedar Rapids. Also starring Christie Lynn Smith as Deardra Farnum, Joe Reegan as Private Billy Babcock, Larry Cedar as Principal Ben Sandborn and Glenn Morshower as Intelligence Officer. Unlike the cult original you see much more of the insane infected people, there is much more violence and bloody effects, and you actually know what is going on and why, so like The Fly it is a much better horror remake. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything the original movie should have been, and more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit when I saw the trailer, I got all excited to see this movie. However, when I heard it was a remake, I started to worry; which led me to see the original film, and I thought it was decent, but that's where it stopped. However, more trailers and a clip had sort of led me to want to go see the movie. So today, my girlfriend and I went to go see the movie in the theater, and left my expectations behind.In my opinion, this film is simply a HUGE improvement on the original film. Not only is it more intense but it's virtually the movie that the original movie never was- an intense horror/thriller that is also a social commentary on the government, and how they waste resources as opposed to making an effort to take care of the problem. Earlier this year we had the fantastic "Daybreakers", which was a social commentary on the economic state of today, this month we have The Crazies. And the social commentary works really well.The acting here is fantastic. That's something rare for a horror movie- the horror genre has always been notorious for its bad acting- but the acting is surprisingly great. Olyphant gives an excellent performance as David, the protagonist. Radha Mitchell is also fantastic and makes her character likable. There is a good deal of blood and gore in the movie, so the under 15s will definitely want to stay away.I don't want to spoil a lot, but I just want to let you know I thought this movie was great, and a good time at the cinema for sure/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This more wicked than Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As president of the unofficial Crazies Fan Club, one would think that I could scrounge up even a little bit of love for this movie. However, I would have to lie to say that this movie has anything worth giving credit to.I was shocked by this unchristian "Disney" flick. I thought this was a comedy Eddie Murphey should have done,but you know what? The movie isn't even about him! His character is totally nonexistent. There's a whole tragic/romance angle that I was completely surprised with. This movie smacks of "Ghost Dad" (with Bill Cosby) meets "Harry Potter". While not measuring up to the imaginative part of the Potter movies (which I also would NOT recommend, especially to kids), The Crazies even tries to copy the special features with a tour of the Haunted Mansion complete with arrows, etc. Here's where the similarities stop.While some parents will find it offensive for the bad values it teaches, others with different values won't find it entertaining in spite of the mocking of historical doctrines. Not entertaining, not uplifting and NOT up to the standards of Walt Disney or Pirates of the Caribbean.I give this 1 out of 10 because Walt would NEVER be proud of this flick, ever!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrible. If IMDb would let me just post one word I would have stopped at "TERRIBLE" and not wasted my time writing any further.The movie is based on an original screenplay done in Germany in 1973.There are too many ridiculous "saved at the last second" scenes. The character development was below average at best. The acting of the two main characters was good but the movie was awful. What a waste of film.The director of Texas Chainsaw should have got a hold of this one.I felt like I was watching a B zombie movie with a larger budget. WARNING: Do not see this movie. WARNING: Do not see this movie.Why? It is lame. The best part of the movie is the end.1 star each to the leading characters and that's it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breck Eisner ..Please take a break and give us one as well.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an interview given to one of the reporters, Mr. Eisner, the director of the movie "The Crazies", and Michael "I wrecked Disney" Eisner's son himself, had warned that the film would scare the hell out of the audiences and said that it would give one sleepless nights.Now, let me put this straight, after I had watched The Crazies, I can come to the absolute conclusion that Mr. Breck Eisner is losing his way out there completely. The situation is not far when people will start ridiculing him at every launch or premiere of a movie of the horror genre.I mean, what is he doing?.Does he ever come to know what the audiences think about his horror films produced or directed by him and what the audiences actually want?.People go inside the hall and literally make fun of the characters and the movie.What chill and what thrill is he talking about? His thoughts and assumptions are going in the wrong direction.he expects us to be afraid..well we are not but instead embarrassed.Talking about The Crazies, the movie was a poor one.The storyline had nothing special and exciting.The usage of background music was pathetic according to the film sequences. The film had the typical elements of the typical ghostly faces and sounds and also the boring creepy atmosphere that was created. The movie had the same lame and boring atmospheric elements as that of Michael &amp; Mickey, Thoughtcrimes, The Grand Opening of Euro Disney, and The Pixar Story. Audiences can just whistle and tease and take the interest away during the movie.The cinematography with the camera-work was awful and disgusting.Breck Eisner wants to scare us but he needs to find new ways.Gone are the days of Ghostbusters and other ghost films like Eisner's Haunted Mansion in which he had some success.He really needs to look up to some Hollywood or Japanese movies and get some inspiration from them if he can't deliver it on his own and there is nothing wrong in it.Every good director gets inspired by Hollywood films and does copy the style because in the end what matters is the audience entertainment. If not watch Hollywood movies then read some good books or Ghost stories by some very famous authors and make a movie on that but not this.The performances given by the actors couldn't really help the story and the direction and instead made things worse. There comes a time when one begins to feel embarrassed after spending even only 30 bucks for the show after the taunts in the hall.The child artists cannot be blamed as direction was poor. The story didn't have much to really set a chilling effect.Faces made along with sounds were just boring.Mr Eisner's son ..wake up...Do make Horror movies.. We need them but change the style. The horror genre of films are soon starting to disappear from the American Film Industry.We need quality stuff and if movies like The Crazies are made time and time again then we can all really stop going to movie theaters.</fullReview>
