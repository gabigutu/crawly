		<shortDescription>A good period fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I'm a sucker for both postwar noir and movies about heaven, hell, the Devil et al, from "Dante's Inferno" through "Petey Wheatstraw," so maybe I like this one more than you would. But I do like it a lot. Paul Muni is hilarious, mugging outrageously when he's not leaping through the air to rumble with devils or thugs.Never been the biggest Claude Rains fan--his prissiness wears on me midway through any film he's in--but he makes a good, nasty Satan. The scenes in Hell, which looks like the boiler room on the Titanic, are priceless. Lots of good character actors playing brawny devils, lunkheaded mooks, tough dames, flustered Man Fridays and such. The plots a little more clever than you'd expect from this kind of film, with a very nice twist at the end. Definitely worth seeing if you're a fan of the oldies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent performances all around in MR. JORDAN turned around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin, it's tough as nails to see a decent print of this public domain film. TCM has a very good 35mm print in their library, so I recommend seeing it there (unless you're fortunate to see it on the screen).ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER was written by Harry Segall, who also penned HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. The film is a delicious turnabout of its wonderful predecessor and Claude Rains turns in his angels wings for devils hoofs and, frankly, is much more deliciously at home. Anne Baxter is superbly understated as Barbara Foster and Onslow Stevens has a larger-than-usual role as her friend and Judge Parker's doctor/psychiatrist. Judge Parker and Eddie Kagle are both played by the great Paul Muni. Muni is a joy to watch in this picture. He rises to both comedic and extraordinarily sensitive moments in the film. And he does a few "Scarface" pantomime moments, brief elegant gestures, that show what a truly great screen presence he could be.The crucial scene in ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER is where Eddie, brought back from Hades by the Devil and now inhabiting the body of Judge Parker, is having a picnic lunch with his secretary/fiancé. Here he discovers all the truly important and wonderful things that life has to offer - all of which he lost out on because of his life of crime and immorality. Eddie is torn and tortured and Muni plays the inner torment with amazing sincerity. Helping a great deal is one of Dimitri Tiomkin's best, though least-known, musical scores. It is a far cry from his usual bombast and has many passages of great tenderness.Rains, of course, is marvelous and there are quite a few genuinely threatening moments in his performance. Fine support is given by James Flavin (who, in addition to his role as politico Bellamy is also heard off-screen as a district attorney, a very curious happenstance), George Cleveland (as the Judge's valet), Erskine Sanford as a minister, Hardie Albright as Smiley Williams and Fritz Leiber, Noble Johnson and Kurt Katch as residents of Hades.This is not a great film. But it's a very, very good film with some very fine sequences and performances. It deserves far better treatment than it has received since its copyright lapsed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An All-Time Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's the film everyone remembers from those Saturday afternoon TV film matinees. The producer, Charles R. Rogers, had a pretty bleak record when it came to producing films on his own (he was once a V.P. at Universal before going solo). But with "Angel" he knocked it out of the park. He inserted age-old movie favorties and combined them into one story. Gangsters, fights, comedy, drama, fantasy... what's not to love?"Angel on My Shoulder" (1946) offers up classic performances by such legendary stars as Paul Muni, Anne Baxter, and Claude Rains. All cast to type, they give performances that are timeless. When you think of any of these stars, think of them in this film and it will give you a pretty good idea as to what each was known for.Although this film was put together during the tail end of World War II and was designed as escapist fun, it holds up today. In fact, it begs for a good re-make. One was done for TV back in 1980, but fell flat. So bad was that version, that they should pay you to watch it. Yet if someone was to do it correctly today, they would have a real gem on their hands.If you haven't seen the original 1946 version, catch it on TV. It belongs in everybody's movie-watching repertoire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is a dead convict brought back to earth by the devil in "Angel on my Shoulder," a 1946 film also starring Claude Rains and Anne Baxter. Muni is Eddie, a convict fresh out of jail who is killed by his partner Smiley and goes straight to you know where. Let's just say it's hot. The devil, played by Claude Rains, needs help himself. A Judge Parker is keeping too many candidates out of hell, and he sees that Eddie is a ringer for the Judge. So he arranges for Eddie to get into the judge's body as he sleeps so that he can ruin the judge's reputation and Eddie can get revenge on Smiley. But even the best-laid plans of the Devil can go astray.During and after World War II, films dealt with psychiatry, with angels, with death, and with people returning from the dead. All of this had to do with the emotional and adjustment problems that returning soldiers had and with the loss of loved ones in countless families. "Angel on My Shoulder" is along the same idea as "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" and "A Guy Named Joe," and a close brother of "Heaven Can Wait" and the later "The Bishop's Wife." This is an excellent example of the genre, with top acting by Paul Muni, Anne Baxter, and Claude Rains. Muni is great in a Bogart type of role - he gives a performance imbued with toughness and humor as a bad guy who begins to see the other side of evil. Anne Baxter is very good as his patient but suffering fiancée, endeavoring to understand the difference in the judge's personality. As the Devil, Claude Rains is inspired casting. He's elegant, charming and manipulative, and gets plenty nervous when he sees things aren't working out as he planned.Wonderful film, and a good chance to see the fine actor Paul Muni in a lighter role than he usually played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tony Carmonte meets a diabolical Mr. Jordan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a nice mixture of two great movies: the crime film SCARFACE (1932) and the fantasy HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. And it also is the only time that two of the best actors of the golden age of sound films worked in a film side by side in the same scenes of a movie.* I am referring to Mr. Paul Muni, who played Tony Carmonte in SCARFACE and Mr. Claude Rains, who played that beacon of heavenly fairness and decency Mr. Jordan in HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. (*The two actors actually appeared in a film before this: JUAREZ in 1939. But Paul Muni played Benito Juarez, and shared no scene with Rains as Napoleon III of France - the two leaders never met.)Muni's Eddie Kagle is a reprise of his Tony Carmonte, complete with Carmonte's deadly looking slit-like stare. But at the start of the film he is murdered by "Smiley" Williams (Hardie Albright - who is always smiling), and finds himself in the netherworld's lower regions. In some ways Eddie's discovery of Hell is among the best part of the film, as he sees the other inhabitants are all in a state of continuous agony and realization of their own sins. Eddie does not have sufficient time to suffer to become as zombie-like. A stranger comes to him, offering him an opportunity to get out of that place. Eddie is willing to hear the deal.The stranger is Rains, naturally playing the Devil (and thus joining the ranks of Walter Huston, Adolphe Menjou, Ray Milland, Laird Cregar, Ray Walston, and Edward Arnold). Rains is a businesslike Devil, who complains to his henchman that the place is too cold (the henchman increases the heat). He has nothing currently going on, when he has noticed Muni. Muni's Eddie Kagle resembles a Judge Parker, an honest, upright man who is running for governor of his state. Rains realizes that if Kagle can replace Parker, then he can ruin the Judge's campaign for cleaning up the corruption in his state.So Rains makes his offer to the eager Muni: if Kagle agrees to this switch, playing the role of Parker while the latter is in an enforced coma, and undoing Parker's campaign, Kagle will get a chance to even the score with good old "Smiler". Muni is definitely interested, but he wants a guarantee of no double-crossing. He knows his Devil as well as any other human, and he does not want old "Smiler" to get away.This is the main problem that perplexes Rains in the movie. He is the author of all the mischief in the universe, but he is also unable to fully control how that mischief is working (an interesting variation on the Devil - compare Rains here with Milland as "Nick Beal" or Walter Huston (for the most part) as "Mr. Scratch"). The best moment illustrating this problem: Rains gets Muni worked up to deliver a violent tirade that would send Judge Parker's campaign into the toilet. But a bunch of gangsters, opposed to Parker, arrange for the "Judge" to be met with a barrage of garbage thrown at him on stage when he's about to speak, knocking him out. Rains is flabbergasted by this, and he can't prevent it: the gangsters are doing his work too. Kagel/Parker is not condemned in the papers but praised for his bravery against the gangsters.Also, as the film progresses, Muni meets the Judge's girlfriend Barbara Foster (Anne Baxter). He falls for her, and she slowly "corrupts" him - he starts wondering if the Judge and Barbara don't have the better view of the world.The film is a good fantasy, that resolves well - a kind of a twist, in fact, on the conclusion of CASABLANCA, with Muni and Rains walking off together, tied by the knot of their agreement. But who will win - we are never certain until the end.The title of the film, by the way, is based on a line of dialog from a sermon that a minister (Erskine Sanford) is preparing and reads out loud.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, Claude Rains played an angel. Here he gets to play the opposite end of the game -- the role every actor loves to play, Satan. He is wry, menacing, and delicious as the master of evil who has met his match in a hood played wonderfully by Paul Muni. The story is interesting and the acting is first rate.

		<fullReview>I didn't know anything about Muni, but I was hooked into this film by his performance. At nearly 50 when he made this movie, he quite effectively conveyed a boyish marvel when he crossed over from the dark side (trying not to include any spoilers). I believe his performance is what makes this film work. He brought comedy and dry wit into the scenes, without, himself, being too corny. He also brought energy and resilience. Watching the movie, I felt I was watching a 21st century actor. His performance is quite different than the somber, pensive performances of characters his age in noir films of that day. In summary, while this is not a great film, it is a gem just because it so different, made that way especially by Muni's performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paul Muni goes to The Devil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let out of jail, gangster Paul Mini (as Eddie Kagle) is shot dead by the "double crossing rat" who picks him up at the prison. Uncomfortable in Hell, Mr. Muni hooks up with wicked Claude Rains (as "Nick"), who seems to know his way around the underworld. Not guessing Mr. Rains is the devil in disguise, Muni walks with Rains through fire, and returns to observe the Living World. There, Rains arranges a body-switch with look-alike Judge Frederick Parker (also played by Muni). Muni is promised revenge on the crook who crossed him; and, Rains is unhappy with the Judge, who hasn't been sending many souls to Hell.So, criminal Muni embodies good Muni...Archie Mayo's "Angel on My Shoulder" isn't as well-remembered, or as original, as other films visiting the same territory; but, watching Muni and Rains makes up most of the difference. This version is played as a sometimes comic drama, and the stars are devilishly fun to watch. Also notable is Anne Baxter (as Barbara Foster), who plays the pretty fiancée Muni amusingly gropes with approval, then falls in love with. She may be his salvation. Perfectly cast Hardie Albright (as Smiley Williams) is no slouch; in once of the film's best scenes, he holds his own with Muni and Rains in the room. Others haven't as much to do, but they do it well.******* Angel on My Shoulder (9/20/46) Archie Mayo ~ Paul Muni, Claude Rains, Anne Baxter, Hardie Albright</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Angel on My Shoulder (1946)It's great to see Paul Muni in another role--he's a great actor who did too few films--and it's never bad to see Claude Rains. In this case Muni plays a con who has gone to hell, and Rains is the devil himself. They have an arrangement to go up to the surface of the earth and some trickiness ensues. It's fun, deceptive, sometimes humorous, sometimes romantically serious.Because the plot is a clear contrivance, the movie does have a slightly illustrative sense, the way "Harvey" does with James Stewart. But sometimes you forget about the devil and the deals he's made, and you just watch, and the best parts of the movie rise above the cleverness. This is director Archie Mayo's last film, and though he no Hollywood legend, he was a serious, consistent director, and this proves it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni is a hard-boiled gangster who literally goes to Hell. Claude Raines is a smooth Devil who will cut Muni a deal if he goes back to Earth and ruins the name of a good and upright man. Ann Baxter is the monkey wrench. Sounds like a drama and it is, but it's kind of a "comedy-noir". It's also a great romantic comedy. Paul Muni is tough, funny and at times sensitive, Anne Baxter is a long suffering fiancé and just the kind of woman for whom a tough mug like Muni's Eddie could turn over a new leaf, and Claude Raines makes an excellent "Nick", both funny and ominous.There is a nice twist at the end and the closing scene is one of my favorite finales in filmdom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever, Amusing, and a little Surprising</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni leads a talented cast in Archie Mayo's dark comedy about a wise-guy (Eddie Kagle/Muni) who, murdered, finds himself entangled in one of Satan's (Claude Rains) schemes to outwit his arch-rival and steal the soul of a righteous judge who happens to look exactly like Kagle. Kagle is willing to do the devil's handiwork as long as he can get revenge upon his murderer. But living vicariously in the life of a good man (Judge Parker), loved by an even better woman (Barbara/Anne Baxter) Kagle begins to question the evils of his life.While Angel on my Shoulder is not quite a redemption story, it endows its characters with just enough conscience to make them sympathetic. The characterizations are strong - especially for the three leads - Muni, Rains and Baxter. All three are excellent, and help to make the film worth watching. The script is good, and occasionally very clever, but also slips once in a while. The pace is steady though not brisk. The cinematography is, at times, a bit hokey, but this fits the occasional lapses into silliness which the story indulges.Recommended for young adults and older adults. Aspects of the film may frighten younger viewers and some of the key humor may not be appropriate for kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am now 40. I saw this film when I was 12 in Detroit,on a fuzzy channel, and it had yet to be digitally remastered... But I never forgot it. When TCM showed it I made it a point to tape it. I watched while taping, and 28 years later still I was still glued to the screen. It's films like this 1 that Martin Scorsese wants preserved, and with good reason. Top notch acting and directing, a wonderfully dramatic musical score, and fine photography. Muni and Rains click like Astaire's tap shoes in this. There is a great chemistry between the 2. Also the supporting cast does a splendid job holding the background down.I recommend it to anyone who loves the old classics!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Worth Seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a great movie about a lost soul who beats the Devil at his own game.Hollywood can learn much from old time movies such as these. It is an original.I would have thought this would have become a cult classic. It's campy, although definitely entertaining in its own right.I have two VHS copies of this film at home and on both, the sound leaves a bit to be desired. You can overcome that, though.We are too into formulaic movies in 2006. My guess that we don't see much along the lines of spirituality is that the people in Hollywood are not in tune with their spiritual natures. Their loss and ours - for different reasons.If you know your history about Heaven and Hell, the Devil and God, you will find this movie doubly entertaining.This is one of the first movies that I will pull out if my guests are interested in seeing "something different." I highly recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) is shot dead by Smiley (Hardie Albright) but is given a second chance at life by Nick (Claude Rains). Nick is Satan and is concerned that he's not getting enough followers these days. Eddie's task is to take over the body of Judge Parker and start misbehaving and corrupting a few people. In return, Nick promises that Eddie can avenge his death by killing Smiley. With the deal struck, Nick and Eddie set about their business. However, circumstances don't go as planned and Nick hadn't counted on the influence that Judge Parker's fiancée, Barbara (Anne Baxter) exerts over Eddie......This film is a comedy that is very funny due to Eddie's out-of-character behaviour as Judge Parker. The 3 main characters are all very good in their parts. Claude Rains is a stylish devil while Anne Baxter is a strong-minded woman who holds her own in the face of her husband's character transformation. We are carried along with the story of incidents that go wrong and witness the growing bond that develops between the characters of Barbara and Eddie Kagle, posing as the Judge. Alongside the humour, we have emotional moments as we realize that Eddie and Barbara's love is a love that can never be. It's sad and it made me cry. Paul Muni and Anne Baxter express their separate heartbreaks very convincingly, while Claude Rains is always amusing in his role.It's a fun story. What a shame that the quality of the picture isn't very good. Oh, and by the way, hell isn't actually like that at all.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a 'B' film, this is about the best you can get, surprisingly well acted and cleverly done, with a fine cast supporting an interesting story. It was my first look at Paul Muni, who expresses a wide range of emotions as the murdered gangster who returns to Earth in a switcheroo for a judge who's been restoring victims to a place in society at the expense of the Devil (Claude Rains). Once involved with the Devil's deal however, things don't go as old Beelzebub had planned; every effort to cast Judge Parker (Muni's alter-ego) in a bad light winds up making him an even bigger hero.One of the things you'll have to get past though is how those closest to the real Judge Parker, his fiancée Barbara (Anne Baxter) and butler Albert (George Cleveland), wind up accepting his severely out of character behavior. Albert had it right in declaring, "... I don't wish to alarm you, but the Judge is definitely not himself this morning."Claude Rains has always been one of my favorite actors from the 1940's era, ever since watching him as the French prefect in "Casablanca". He always sported elegance and charm, even while portraying the smarmiest characters. No different here, as Beelzebub/Mephistopheles/Satan, Rains is a cunning devil, but easily perturbed when things don't go his way. He also had some of the film's best lines, I got a particular kick out of his remark on the aborted airplane flight to St. Louis - "... being up so high makes me uncomfortable", acknowledging a violation of heavenly air space.One of the successes of the movie is the way it keeps you guessing how things will eventually turn out, with the transformation of gangster Eddie Kagle (Muni again) into a compassionate human being. In that regard, the picture borrows a page from the Warner Brothers societal agenda, examining how circumstances early in one's life can have a profound effect on it's outcome. The bittersweet ending finds Kagle a reformed spirit, unable to elude Lucifer's deadly deal, but leaving his mark nonetheless on those who's lives he touches.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Mini is Eddie Kagel, a tough gangster who is just released from prison after a four-year stretch. He's picked up at the gate by his old friend Smiley, who greets him effusively, considering that he's another hood. The pair drive away, punching each other lovingly on the arms, friends since childhood. "Where's my rod?" asks Muni. "I got it right here," replies the smiling Smiley. "Give it to me," says Muni. Smiley pulls out the gun and shoots Muni dead.Muni finds himself in hell, which turns out to look a lot like Newark, New Jersey, all flames, furnaces, bubbling mud pots, and "hotter than Florida." The Devil is Claude Raines, who looks pretty Satanic with those kick lights always under his face. The suave Raines makes a deal. He'll take Muni back and plant him in the body of an honest judge. Muni will do his evil act and ruin the good judge's reputation. Then Raines will let Muni give Smiley what's coming to him.Well -- the best laid plans, you know? Enter the judge's sexy, good-looking girl friend, Anne Baxter. She's so disgustingly virtuous that she's at first shocked by the new judge's lack of social polish. He says things like, "Say, ain't no dame ever put nothing over on me." His manners are pustular. He gulps down double scotches and smokes cigars. And he doesn't know what the hell is going on. He talks to the now-invisible Raines, who is coaxing him on how to be bad, as if Muni needed lessons.I think the sophisticated viewer can take the plot from here. Baxter converts Muni into a man of the most pure moral thoughts. Muni now loves Baxter but he no longer gropes her at every opportunity. He refuses to kill the treacherous Smiley when he has the chance. The disgusted Raines gives up, returns the original judge, and takes Muni back to hell, where he will be a trustee instead of a stoker. I was a little mixed up about the whereabouts of the original judge, the one Muni, as Kagel, replaced.No matter. This is a fantasy, and an old one at that. Except for the personae and some plot details, you must have seen it before in one or another of its incarnations -- "Here Comes Mister Jordan," or "Heaven Can Wait," "A Guy Named Joe," "Always." Two of those are remakes of the other two.It's a pleasant enough diversion, although I wish the writers hadn't confused hydrogen sulfide with H2SO4. They could also have gotten the quote from Dante accurate. It's not "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here." It's "Abandon all hope, ye who enter here." Heck, I had to look that up in Wikipedia. It only took a few minutes, and I don't see why the writers couldn't have taken the time.Muni is often accused of overacting and I guess he does overact, but I didn't mind much. His simian features were a little disturbing. It's difficult to understand how the cute, chubby, petite Anne Baxter could have fallen for a guy who looks like that -- but then he's a big-shot mayor and is headed for the governorship. Okay. I think I do understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Largely forgotten and perhaps with good reason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Archie Mayo's curio "Angel on my Shoulder" is virtually unknown despite a cast headed by Paul Muni, Claude Rains and Anne Baxter. It's a fantasy along the same lines as "Here Comes Mr Jordan" and "It's a Wonderful Life". It came out in the same year as "It's a Wonderful Life" which may be one reason it's gotten lost in that movie's grander shadow or perhaps it's simply because it's not really that good. Muni seems totally lost in the role of a dead gangster fuelling the fires of Hell before he's brought back to inhabit the body of a 'good' judge the Devil is trying to get his hands on, (watching this you would never think Muni was once considered a great actor). Rains, on the other hand, looks like he's enjoying this nonsense though it's hardly what you would call acting; more like smirking as he goes through the motions. The ridiculous plot has Muni and Rains returning from Hell so that Rains' Devil can get the righteous judge down below, (and give Muni's gangster the chance to get revenge on the guy who plugged him). Of course, considering he's the Devil, Rains seems singularly unprepared for Anne Baxter's sweetness-and-light fiancée whose goodness messes up his plans somewhat. Naturally, it's a comedy and it's not unamusing in a daft kind of way but it's hardly memorable. Par for the Archie Mayo course, in fact.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taken by his performance in the superb 1934 Film Noir Crime Without Passion,I was excited to recently discover that the BBC had shown a rarely mentioned Claude Rains movie,which led to me looking at my shoulders.The plot:Freed from jail,gangster Eddie Kagle gets picked up by his old friend Smiley Williams. Barely driving a mile,Williams catches Kagle by surprise,by grabbing his gun and killing him. Waking up from the shots,Kagle discovers that he has ended up in hell! Spotting him,"Nick" goes up to Kagle and tells him that he resembles a saintly Judge called Frederick Parker,who has been causing Nick problems.Desperate to get rid of Parker,Nick offer Kagle the chance for his soul to be transferred into Parker,on the catch that Kagle must ruin Parker's run in the upcoming election. Returning to earth,Kagle soon begins to feel that he does not want to leave it in the hellish state he last left it.View on the film:Going to hell in a hand-basket within the first 5 minutes,director Archie Mayo (who argued with Paul Muni during production) kicks his final movie off with a blazing opening that covers the title in a devilish Film Noir atmosphere,as burning pits of fire and risqué clothes give the afterlife an ultra-stylised fetish gloss. Keeping the fire simmering on earth,Mayo and cinematographer James Van Trees keep the burning hell pulling Kagle back from his glimpses of heaven,with tightly threaded shots always keeping the devil in the corner,ready to push Kagle back in line.Changed from its original title Me and Satan over fears that no one would watch a flick with Satan in the title,the screenplay by Harry Segall &amp; Roland Kibbee strike the fire of the Film Noir with the cooling down orders of The Hays Code. Firing things up by sending Kagle straight to hell,the writers do tame some of the flames by having Kagle discover some morals (boo!) but nicely undermine them with satirical "small town" punch-ups and a delightfully cynical Film Noir final smoke.Staying away from the screen for 8 years after making this, Paul Muni gives a terrific performance as Kagle and Parker,who are each given a strong contrast by Muni with Parker having a walking on water saintly manner which is burnt down by the chomping with fury, hellish off the cuff dialogue from Film Noir loner Kagle. Sliding along in the darkness, Claude Rains gives a devilish performance as Nick,thanks to Rains layering on the charm whilst keeping Nick's vicious intentions intact,as Kagle soon discovers that what is on his shoulder is not an angel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Character-Driven Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Situated well within the tradition of Forties supernatural comedies such as HERE COMES MR. JORDAN (1941) and BLITHE SPIRIT (1945), ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER - penned by Harry Segall, who also wrote MR. JORDAN - centers on Eddie (Paul Muni) a gangster shot to death by his presumed best friend and sent to Hell as a result. There he encounters the Devil (Claude Rains), also known as Nick; and the Devil offers a bargain whereby Eddie can return to Earth, so long as he inhabits the body of Judge Frederick Parker, one of Nick's deadliest enemies, and thereby contribute to Parker's demise. Eddie readily agrees, as it provides a chance for him to get revenge on his killer (Hardie Allbright) at the same time. The story proceeds in a series of comic misadventures, all carefully planned by Nick, but which go catastrophically wrong in their execution. As Judge Parker, Eddie gets involved in a fist-fight that enhances rather than destroys the judge's reputation; later on, he is about to take a bribe for a case when he discovers that the defendant is one of his ex-girlfriends (Marion Martin), prompting Eddie/ Judge Parker to send her to jail where she belongs.The script is full of sharp witticisms, especially for Rains; not normally associated with comedies, he is given the opportunity to indulge in a range of facial expressions as he discovers that the Devil no longer possesses the power he once thought he had. Muni gets the chance to parody his famous tough-guy role in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (1932), with his rangy walk, head bent forward and his arms perpetually down by side, he looks like the typical heavy devoid of intelligence but with plenty of strength. He makes some delicious mispronunciations of the words "Mephistopheles" and "Beelzebub."In truth the film's message is a profoundly conservative one; follow the ways of God and you will be protected from corruption. Eddie learns this precept as the action unfolds, which inspires him to turn against Nick and make decisions for himself. Yet there remains something peculiarly attractive about Hell, even if it is only the wonderfully Gothic sets with smoke arising from them (by Bernard Herzbrun), through which Eddie wanders before encountering Nick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Archie Mayo poses the theory . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . that everyone has an evil twin (unless they're evil, in which case they have an honest double) in his film, ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER. One of the most famous proofs of this notion came in the 1900s during World War II, when Doppelgangsters Adolf Hitler and Charles Chaplin dominated the Big Screen (as Hitler starred in TRIUMPH OF THE WILL, and Chaplin actually subbed for Hitler in THE GREAT DICTATOR, just as evil Paul Muni subs for honest Paul Muni in ANGEL). Of course, things do not always work out as neatly in Real Life as they do in ANGEL. In cases such as O.J. Simpson, Robert Blake, or Mel Gibson, the Yang seems to permanently replace the Yin. On the other hand, there are opposite examples, such as the youth scout genocide participant from a distant land whose double got a Nobel Peace Prize as soon as he became the Leader of the Free World. Good or evil, Paul Muni looks particularly creepy in ANGEL, which may dissuade many viewers from looking into mirrors for awhile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clever story; superb performance by Paul Muni.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man undergoes a dramatic personality change for reasons known only to the audience. For this story to work, the audience must accept its premise: that there are things going on that can only be accepted as a matter of faith. The existence of spiritual forces beyond the five senses is an idea as old as civilization itself. It is a fundamental basis for religion. As regard to this movies, the intercession of these forces have both comical and serious consequences, comical in how people react to the judge's radically changed character and how the judge himself reacts to his new persona, and serious that the movie conveys the message that even within the nastiest persons there is a kernel of goodness. Paul Muni gives a great performance as Eddie Kagle, gangster turned good guy. Anne Baxter is wonderful as the judge's fiancé who stays loyal to the judge. This movie is worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Split personality of a film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years I avoided films with Paul Muni because I identified him too much with a film genre I generally don't enjoy -- gangster pics. Then I recently caught a couple of non-gangster pics ("The Last Angry Man" and "The Story of Louis Pasteur"), and decided I needed to give Muni another chance.But, you can't win them all. This film was a good idea, but never succeeded in fulfilling its potential. The first problem, which is very obvious, is the very poor and cheap special effects in the beginning of the picture. I'm not talking about poor special effects in comparison to Toyoda's films, but poor special effects even for the late 1940s.Second is Muni's role itself, particularly in the first half of the film. They pretty much pull out every stereotype about old-fashioned gangsters they could think of. Very stereotypical. Later in the film, when Muni's character begins to go straight, Muni makes the character a little more three-dimensional. It's almost too much of a change to tolerate in a 100 minute film. First half, traditional gangster. Second half a performance good enough to make me want to see much more of Paul Muni.There are some things that work here. First off, Claude Rains is great as the Devil. He doesn't overplay the role, just a very nice conservative performance...that works.Anne Baxter is pretty good here as the female lead. Everyone else is very secondary, but they all do their jobs.In terms of the plot -- good idea. But for the first half of the film it just sort of muddles through until the transformation of the main character begins. Some will be disappointed in the conclusion of the film, but it's a logical ending.I do have one gripe. Why do many people describe this as comedy. It's not. Period.The first half of this film is a "D" for me, while the second half is a good solid "B". So, I'll give it a C...a "7".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To Hell and Back</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER (United Artists, 1946), directed by Archie Mayo, stars Paul Muni in one of his finer film efforts in his latter movie career. An interesting yet unusual project for the Academy Award winning actor best known for solid dramatic roles and historic figures where his facial make-up in thirties screen performances of Louis Pasteur, Emile Zola and Benito Juarez at Warner Brothers allowed him to appear in almost unrecognizable manner, Muni, who wouldn't allow himself to fall victim in type-casting, assumes his first gangster role since SCARFACE (United Artists, 1932). Rather than playing an Italian accented gang leader who becomes the "shame of a nation," this time Muni does one better, that of a tough-talking American mug who never got passed the third grade who learns a moral lesson during his second chance in life.Opening title: "This story is about Eddie Kagle, who based his way of living on what Omar Khayyam once said: 'Live fully while you may and reckon not the cost.'" After serving a four year prison term, Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni), gangster, walks out freely into the world where he's greeted by his boyhood pal and partner, "Smiley" Williams (Hardie Albright). As Eddie's being taken for a ride, he asks Smiley for his gun. Four shots are fired. The spirit of Eddie Kagle ends up in the pits of hell, surrounded by heat, lava, fire, darkness and the smell of "rotten eggs." Along the way he comes across other lost souls bound to eternal condemnation. Because Eddie happens to be the spitting image of a Judge Frederick Parker, an honest politician running for governor, Nick (Claude Rains), the devil, wanting to take more souls with him into hell, allows Kagle temporary freedom outside Hades to avenge his killer in exchange for he assuming the body of Judge Parker to dishonor his good name. Upon his return to Earth, Kagle, assuming Parker's identity after collapsing in the courtroom. While following Nick's plan, Eddie unwittingly fails in his assignment through unforeseen circumstances. Having found love with Barbara Foster (Anne Baxter), the judge's secretary and fiancée, the devil uses every possible motive to tempt Eddie into sin, even to a point of having him come face to face with Smiley. With an "angel on his shoulder," Eddie comes up with some plans of his own.A fantasy-comedy with warmth and humor, the original story, credited to Harry Segall, very much borrows from his own premise of the motion picture classic, HERE COMES MR. JORDAN (Columbia, 1941), starring Robert Montgomery and Claude Rains, only in reverse. Changing the emphasis from Heaven to Hell and Claude Rains assuming similar duties from guardian angel to guardian demon, with parallel ideas in different directions, the film overall is quite entertaining. More talk than action, with Muni taking full control of his actions, showing two sides of his nature, it is Rains who holds his own in fine support as he did in HERE COMES MR. JORDAN. Although Anne Baxter seems too youthful to be playing Muni's love interest to his other character, her performance with uplift forties hairstyle and mature mannerisms overcomes such obstacles. Other members of the cast include: Onslow Stevens (Doctor Max Higgins, Parker's psychiatrist); George Cleveland (Albert, Parker's servant); James Flavin, Jonathan Hale, Ben Weldon and Addison Richards, among others.By the time the made-for-television remake of ANGEL ON MY SHOULDER starring Peter Strauss, Richard Kiley and Barbara Hershey was released in 1980, the 1946 original, which had fallen into public domain, was soon revived on many public television and local TV stations after two decades away from the TV markets. Availability onto video cassette from numerous distributors and DVD followed, with latter cable television broadcasts on American Movie Classics (1991) and Turner Classic Movies (2003 onward).While the nearly forgotten Paul Muni name rests on his powerful performance in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG (Warner Brothers, 1932), any movie that has Muni perform a tender love scene, acting drunk and teaming up with the devil, can't be all bad.

		<fullReview>Nick, the Devil, (Claude Rains) allows murdered gangster Eddie Kagle (Paul Muni) to return to life in the body of a lookalike judge, hoping to destroy the judge's good reputation. Eddie's got plans of his own, namely getting revenge on the man who killed him. But neither Eddie nor Nick counted on the judge's fiancée (Anne Baxter), whose love may put Eddie on the side of the angels for once.Very entertaining movie. I've always enjoyed Paul Muni's acting style. He can be very broad and hammy but really knock it out of the park for the emotional scenes. It's a nice blend that sets him apart from most of his contemporaries. Here he's a lot of fun playing a gangster with attitude but when it comes time to get serious he doesn't miss a beat. Claude Rains is also great. There usually was a little bit of the Devil in Mr. Rains' roles so this is a perfect fit for him. Anne Baxter is lovely as always. It's a good fantasy movie with some romance and a lot of humor. You should definitely check it out if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni shines in this 1946 film. What else is new? He beautifully conveys the title role of a mug shot to death by a gang friend wanting to take the organization over. While in Hades, he meets up with Claude Rains as Lucifer. He goes back to extract revenge by exchanging roles with a look-alike judge.This excellent film conveys the possibility of redemption even on the part of such a hardened criminal.Amazing that Anne Baxter, as the judge's girlfriend, has a part that is relatively so benign here. This is the same Baxter who marched down that Oscar aisle that same year for her splendid performance as the ill-fated Sophie in "The Razor's Edge."The film is a great one and should not be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say that my rating for this film is somewhat clouded because that is exactly what the films copy was, very cloudy. I can't believe there is not a restoration in line for this film from 1946, it is barely watchable and the sound mix is nigh on impossible to hear.The film is standard fare as regards the tale of the bad man gets a shot at life again, only here it's with a kicker, and watching this film unfold is never less than interesting without actually pulling up any trees. Paul Muni is fine and plays our main protagonists dual personality with credible verve, and Claude Rains is clearly enjoying himself as the devil of the piece, and I heartily applaud the dark shift the film took for its final reel, yet it is a hard film to reckie unless you can see and hear it properly.I have no hesitation in watching this film again if a restoration comes to pass, but until then I say approach with caution. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs A Little More Credibility, Even For A Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 25 minutes of this movie were very interesting and entertaining with a good mixture of action and comedy. however, once Claude Raines (The Devil) and Paul Muni (a hood who had been killed and sent to Hell) returned to earth and the latter became romantically involved, the film bogged down.Muni assumes the body of "Judge Parker" but still talks and thinks like the thug he was as his old self. I know it's a fantasy story and not be taken seriously, but still - Parker's fiancé never figuring out that this was not the judge even though his grammar, speech, actions, everything about him except his looks was totally foreign to what he used to be - it was too ridiculous and insulting to anyone's intelligence. Fantasy or not, you have to have at least some credibility in the story! I stayed with the film the whole way, and it wasn't bad but I wouldn't watch it again.For those who don't believe there is a Devil, this is a good movie to see as it effectively shows how he whispers attractive things in one's ear and how persuasive he can be....all the while ruining you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid I had a friend whose sister, roughly a generation our senior, was an avid collector of film magazines and annuals. This was in the UK so I'm referring to essentially 'fan' magazines such as Picture Show, Picturegoer, F. Maurice Speed's Film Review, etc. I beguiled many a rainy hour leafing through this ephemera and a 'still', from a film I'd never heard of, Angel On My Shoulder, stayed in my mind. Is showed Claude Rains and Paul Muni emerging from the ground with some bizarre metal arc over their heads. That was the last I heard of Angel On My Shoulder from that day to this, when it was screened on BBC2 at six-fifteen a.m. This I had to see, still knowing nothing about it, and so I got up early. I shudda stood in bed, as they say in New York. In the few films in which I've seen him I've always found Paul Muni so mannered as to make Emil Jannings look laid-back and this was no exception. In the early scenes especially he looked for all the world like someone in a Silent film being directed to express 'terror' or 'zombie', it was hard to decide. As for hell itself it resembled nothing so much as a German 'Expressionist' version of Gene O'Neill's The Hairy Ape. Claude Rains was his usual suave self but forget any chemistry between him and Muni and forget even more strongly any chemistry between Muni and his 'love interest' Anne Baxter. A couple of days before I'd seen Baxter attempting to scare up some chemistry with Monty Clift in I Confess, so it seemed she was, for a time, lumbered with leading men off whom she was unable to strike sparks. It was definitely worth seeing, especially after waiting a lifetime on the strength of one 'still', but once is definitely enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Performances Carry a Theological Farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni is intense and dumb as the gangster Eddie Kagle. Claude Rains is gleeful and wicked as the Devil. They're the main reasons to watch this classic and enjoyable film. This was Archie Mayo's last film. He had directed some very good ones in the 1920's through the 1940's, including "the Petrified Forest." It is not a bad film to end a career on. Basically, this is a medieval morality tale brought up to date by putting it squarely in the Gangster Film genre of the golden age of Hollywood. For the most part evil/sin/hell is equated with gangster/violence/ignorance. The post theological, scientific view that crime is a function of social and economic conditions in a society is abandoned for the more primitive religious view that evil souls are placed in material bodies at birth. Salvation comes through love, sacrifice and the good fortune of hearing religious anti-devil preaching. While communist/socialist writers and actors did influence many movies of the period, we should remember that the rigid Catholic Morality Hays code was king at this time, and quasi religious films involving angels and devils were quite common. In one way these films are so absurd they subvert the conceptual paradigm of angels and devils. On the other hand, they lend support to and reinforce this type of primitive thinking. Anne Baxter (All About Eve) is delightful in the small role of Muni's fiancé. The sets, cinematography and sound are all top notch for the period. This is a good companion film to "Here Comes Mr. Jordan."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Muni was an actor who was way ahead of his time. Who else could have played Louis Pasteur, Emile Zola, and a gangster, all with perfect accents, inflections, and facial expressions? His kind of acting was so way ahead of his time - most actors in the 1930s and 1940s were typecast into roles that didn't allow them to play a variety of characters. But not Paul Muni. Most actors in the 1930s and 1940s did NOT do accents, even though by today's standards, we consider this a requirement - but not Paul Muni.Having just watched "The Life of Emile Zola", Here his portrayal of Eddie Kagel blew me away. The movie itself is slight, and has some humorous moments. But Paul Muni's performance raises it above the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Jordan Goes To The Dark Side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comparisons for Angel On My Shoulder and Here Comes Mr. Jordan are too obvious to belabor the point. Naturally since the same guy, Harry Segall wrote both screenplays. But in this one Claude Rains goes to the dark side. As Mephistopheles he's ruler of the underworld where the damned toil at their labors for eternity. But even Rains gets quite a handful when Paul Muni makes a sudden trip their courtesy of Hardie Albright.This part of the story is taken right out the plot of Angels With Dirty Faces. You remember that James Cagney took a hiatus from the rackets via a stretch in Sing Sing. When he came back he expected to resume where he left off, but Humphrey Bogart didn't see it that way. But Hardie Albright must have seen Angels With Dirty Faces because he plugs Paul Muni with four shots after picking him up at the prison gate. When Muni arrives in Hell he's only got one thing on his mind, crashing out and getting his former pal. Seeing a resemblance to a respected judge who he's trying to ensnare in sin or disgrace, Rains decides to let Muni out on parole so to speak. Of course he goes with him.When Muni enters the judge's body courtesy of Rains, Rains expects him to just behave in his usual hoodlum manner and disgrace the judge. But somehow the best laid plans of the devil keep getting gummed up. And Muni finds himself falling for the judge's fiancée, Anne Baxter and slowly changing his ways.Angel On My Shoulder was a charming fantasy that marked only the second time Muni returned to a gangster role other than his famous Scarface portrayal. While he was at Warner Brothers Muni rejected gangster parts over and over again. According to his co-star Anne Baxter, Muni was hoping to revive his career with this one. It was not to be. Muni returned to the stage after this film except for two films in the Fifties.Best in this film without a doubt is Claude Rains. Then again he's never bad in anything. If you liked him in Here Comes Mr. Jordan you will equally like him on the dark side. Angel On My Shoulder is an entertaining fantasy, but far from the work Paul Muni did in the Thirties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sweet, Funny, Provocative B Movie; Muni is Fun to Watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Angel on my Shoulder" isn't a great movie; it's a B movie, with low production values and muddled logic and theology. But it's great fun to watch. I laughed out loud and did cry.Paul Muni plays Eddie Kagel, a crime boss, who is exceptionally troublesome once he arrives in Hell. Satan, aka Claude Rains, decides that he can use Kagel to cause trouble for a judge on earth. For some reason the movie never explains, Satan has been waiting for a damned soul who looks exactly like the judge on earth, even though, as the movie explains, no one in hell has a body. Given that no one in hell has a body, why did Satan have to wait for a body double for Judge Parker? Well, as I said, this is a B movie, and its logic and its theology are kind of muddled. That doesn't mean you "shouldn't think too much." Au contraire. This is the kind of movie that makes you think, because it addresses issues like Heaven and Hell and the afterlife and what constitutes virtue and what constitutes vice. So, even though the theology is muddled, it still manages to be provocative. As you're watching this B movie Hell set, you're wondering how this Hell differs from what you think of as Hell."Angel's" Hell is one of the most interesting afterlife sets I've seen in any movie. It's very low budget, and yet I found it convincing and creepy.Paul Muni is incredible fun to watch. Some call his acting "stagey" or "over the top," but neither word really works for me. I think he's just incredibly expressive. For example, in the first scene, after Kagel is released from prison, Kagel / Muni gestures toward the prison house and his gesture tells you everything you need to know about his experience in prison.It's too bad that Muni gets so little attention these days. I wonder how many people realize that Al Pacino's "Scarface" was inspired by Muni? On earth, in the judge's body, Kagel has an epiphany or two, and ... well, I don't want to tell you the end, but I wish the movie hadn't ended that way.In any case, this movie is a lot of fun, and I recommend it for some Halloween night when you want a little bit of Satan but not too much, and just enough Muni.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>******SPOLILERS****** Gangster Eddie Kagle, Paul Muni,serving his latest stretch in prison,is released and picked up by his fellow hood Smiley Williams, Hardie Albright. Smiley took over the criminal operation that Eddie ran while he was in the pen. Driving back to St.Louis Eddie tells Smiley what a good job he did while he was away and how thing are going to get even better now that he's back where, all of a sudden and without warning, Smiley pulls out a gun and blows Eddie away! Waking up in the "Hot Spot" it becomes evident to Eddie that he's dead by talking to some of the residents there. The place is run by this guy called Mephistopheiese or Nick for short who feels that it's not hot enough for him, it's only about 180 degrees, and wants to know why the heat isn't being turned up. Nick's is told by one of his henchmen that there aren't enough workers to shovel the coal into the furnaces because not enough people are qualified to be sent "Down There" due to this Judge Fredrick Parker who's turning people "Up There" into good and decent citizens. It turns out that Eddie is a dead ringer for the judge and Nick gets the bright idea to send Eddie back to the living to replace him and do his, Nick's, dirty work. Eddie of course wants to take care of Smiley who not only double-crossed him but sent him down "There". Taking over the Judges body something happens to Eddie that both he as well as Nick never expected. Eddie becomes a good and decent person and even worse Eddie likes what he became!"Angle on my shoulder" is one of those life after death movies made in the 1940's like "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" and "A Guy Named Joe" where Eddie becomes the good Judge Fredrick and makes up for his life of crime and redeems his soul by doing it. Eddie ends up seeing that it's far better to help people then hurt them even that dirty double-crossing rat Smiley, who I think that Eddie subconsciously thanks for giving him the chance to see the light, by him blowing his brains out. This new revelation on Eddie's part sets up the whole movie of him coming back to be the good person that he became. Seeing that his plan is fast falling apart Nick in a last and desperate act tries to get Eddie to marry Barbara , Anne Baxter, Judge Fredrick's fiancée, in order to get Eddie to do something bad, steal the Judge's girl and to break the hold that the Angle on Eddie's shoulder has on him. Eddie not falling for Nick's underhanded tactics gets wise to his plan at the last moment and tells him he'd rather go back to "Helltown" with him then take Judge Fredrick's girl away from him and agrees to give the Judge back his body. Nick outraged at Eddie for making him look like a jerk tells Eddie that he's really going to give him the "business" when they get back "Down there" But Eddie pulls a ace from up his sleeve and tells Nick that he has "The goods" on him by him making Nick look like a fool and sap in Eddie doing just the opposite that Nick wanted him to do when he took over the good Judge's body. This revelation would expose what an incompetent dope Nick is and make him the laughing stock down there where he's looked upon as being the Big Cheese. Realizing that he's been had Nick reluctantly agrees to share the action and makes Eddie co-partner in his underworld-wide operation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fine fantasy flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MY RATING-7.4Impossible to fail with a formula like this- A gangster is killed by his partner and the Devil gives him the chance of coming back to the world of the living in the body of a judge, to corrupt people. Paul Muni is very nice here, spoofing his own image of gangster as well as Claude Rains, who we believe is really Satan. Anne Baxter is also very sweet and young as the judge's girlfriend. Spite its age, the mov goes quite well and it's entertaining enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Good - I'm now a Muni Fan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this one on Turner Classic Movies the other night and was quite pleasantly entertained. I had heard that Paul Muni was a great actor and now I am a believer. In reading books by Bette Davis who was one of his Warner Bros stablemates, I can see where Muni influenced her a great deal: Davis like Muni used to drive wardrobe people crazy with her perfectionist attitude and like Muni, it is said that Davis would stay in character even when she was away from the studio which drove her husbands batty. Anne Baxter is in this one too. I never was a great fan of hers but in this one she is very good. I don't like to discuss plot on these sites like a lot of people do who really tell you the whole script. I am more interested in the players themselves. Muni really does an excellent job of showing the different emotions of his character. I also like the character Smiley and was surprised to find out he ended up a professor at UCLA. Muni I am told was kind of a nut job who made a surprisingly small number of films given the number other stars churned out in those days. Still, if this one is any indication, he deserves all the accolades for he really is a very good actor. Claude Raines is in it too; sometimes I like him but most of the time his style grates (see Now Voyager). All in all, Warner Bros was my favorite studio and I only wish there was more written about it as opposed to all the hoopla given to MGM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasant B Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not the type of movie that is made to be remembered, but it's a pleasant enough diversion if you're ever looking for something to watch on late night TV. Paul Muni and Claude Rains really seem to be enjoying themselves, Muni as the stereotypical tough guy Bronx gangster with integrity and Rains as a Satan who acts more like a bemused business executive then the king of the underworld. The ending is not as predictable as you expect to be and much more interestingly ambiguous then the original creators probably intended it to be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining and awfully funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paul Muni plays a gangster who is murdered towards the very beginning of the story and is sent to Hell. This gangster seems an awful lot like his character from the movie SCARFACE (1932) and although Muni's acting is far from subtle, it is very entertaining. The Devil is also entertained by how awful the man is--especially since this evil deceased gangster looks just like a nice judge who he wants to discredit. Lucifer lets Muni out of Hell and gives him the judges body--and Muni being such a dumb mug never realizes that it's the Devil helping him or that he was even in Hell!! This seems like a big stretch, but considering the movie IS a fantasy, it can be forgiven. This plan all backfires, though, when Muni unintentionally does good as the judge and the Devil is less than amused.The acting by Muni, as I said before, is pretty broad. However, Claude Rains is wonderful as a much more subtle Devil--one of the better ones Hollywood created--probably second to Laird Crager's version in HEAVEN CAN WAIT. All in all, this movie is just a lot of fun and has quite a few laughs as well. While not great theology, it's immensely entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unconventional near-miss</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was an effort to rekindle the success of Here Comes Mr Jordan in which Claude Rains played a heavenly emissary righting some wrongs. Here Paul Muni plays a thug who gets out of the joint, is instantly killed but returned to life in the body of a judge, and can't let go of his sense of vengeance. This time Rains plays the devil himself. He's quite good and more menacing than a movie of the era would typically allow. The noir stylings are nice. These may be the blackest compositions I've ever seen in a movie. The early minutes in hell look terrific and the movie gets a lot of mileage from a few flames and some grimy, underlit faces. Rain's supernatural character also receives special lighting against dark backgrounds throughout.But it's rather odd that a fantasy goes with a "frustrated romance" format, when comedy seems to be just beneath the surface. And the script is bad; the narrative gets convoluted and the movie lacks any really great scenes. After hell the movie is very blah. A promising, atypical concept is just converted into dozens of unmemorable, conventionalized scenes. All the Kings Men, State of the Union and His Girl Friday all make finer, funnier and smarter moments from political intrigue. And the simple fact is; it's not enjoyable to spend 90 minutes with a lead character this ignorant and vulgar. Muni's redemption arc is very schlocky, and his performance is something out of the distant past. At 50, he's looking a bit gruesome for a leading man role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this in 1946 I absolulty hated it. Having seen it now for a second time, I admit I was wrong,its not that good bit not as bad as I had ythough as an 18 yr old wise guy Paul Muni doesnt overact as badly as he usually does . &amp; Anne Baxters is always pleasant to look at my rating in 1946 was *1/2 now its **1/2as always Jay harris</fullReview>
