		<shortDescription>Great Pre-Code Stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most perfect example of "history on the silver screen" that I can think of. When Ginger Rogers says, "It's the Depression, dearie" at the beginning to explain the chorus girls' bad luck, it's the key to the whole film. While the "Shadow Waltz" number was being filmed during an actual 1933 earthquake in L.A. a number of the girls toppled off the Art Deco "overpass" where they were swaying with their filmy hoop skirts and their neon violins short-circuited. The electrical hook-ups were also rather dangerous, especially if the neon bows came in contact with the girls' metallic wigs in that number. The culminating production number, "Remember My Forgotten Man," is the most significant historically and illustrates Warner Bros.' "New Deal" sensibilities. Warner Bros. was the only studio that "bought" the whole Roosevelt approach to economic recovery. The year before, under Hoover, WWI vets were not only neglected in terms of benefits but were run out of their shanty town near the Capitol building. Starving guys were camping on the edges of most communities who'd served in the Great War fifteen years before. Of course, why or how this number fits into such a '30s girlie-type musical revue is anyone's guess. Berkeley never looked for reality, just eye-popping surrealistic effects.About ten years ago I found myself sitting next to Etta Moten Barnett at a Chicago NAACP banquet. I was flabbergasted. She was in her 90s yet still looked lovely. She's the singer who sang "Forgotten Man" in the window. She also sang "The Carioca" in Astaire and Rogers' first pairing, "Flying Down to Rio." She was quite gracious, though she did not have wonderful things to say about Hollywood of that era. The African Americans in both pictures were fed in a tent away from the general commissary area. Ruby Keeler has a certain odd-ball appeal, like a homely puppy. She can't sing, she watches her leaden feet while she dances, and almost all her lines are read badly. Yes, she was married to Al Jolson, but that may have HURT her career more than anything. He was not exactly always likable. He was much older than Ruby and so full of himself. This film is also a classic example of the PRE-CODE stuff that was slipping by---the leering "midget baby" (Billy Barty), the naked girls in silhouette changing into their "armor," the non-stop flashing of underwear or lack of underwear, Ginger Rogers having her large coin torn off by the sheriff's office mug so she's essentially standing there in panties, and so forth.A good comparison of before and after the code would be to examine this picture and "Gold Diggers of 1935." The latter is so much more chaste, discreet, and less fascinating except for the numbers. There's not the lurid, horny aura of the Pre-Code pictures. And it's not quite as much naughty fun, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvyn Leroy and Busby Berkeley, what a combination!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Golddiggers of 1933" is a fun movie to watch because all the right elements that went into the making of this motion picture. Mervyn Leroy was truly inspired, and his direction clearly shows he was in total command. The contribution made by the incomparable Busby Berkeley is one of the best things in the film. His choreography for the big production numbers is one of the most impressive thing he did for the movies.The film is a sweet story about young hopefuls in New York trying to make it in the musical theater. Thus, we find the impoverished room mates, Carol, Trixie and Polly, who are so poor they have to steal their neighbor's milk! These young women are at the end of their rope when Barney, the Broadway impresario comes by to tell them about the new show he is working on. The only trouble, he has no money for it.How naive and wonderful those movies that came during the great depression were! Everything was possible, in spite of what was happening in the country at the time. In fact, this film, as well as others of that era, served as an excuse for people that were facing a hard time making ends meet for escaping it all when watching a movie like this one.The cast is excellent. Warren William, Joan Blondell, Aline McMahon, Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, Ned Sparks, Ginger Rogers, and Guy Kibbee giving performances that endeared them to the American public of the time.The production number of "Shadow Waltz" has to be one of the best ones in this musical genre ever produced. The number is an amazing one and a tribute to the man who staged it, Busby Berkley. It also help the chorus girls were dressed by Orry-Kelly and the music was by Harry Warren and Al Dubin."Golddiggers of 1933" is one of the best movies to come out of the Hollywood of those years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Depression Era Musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New York City - the height of the Great Depression. Four showgirls, starving, scheming for that next role in a Broadway musical comedy. Looking for the Big Break. Auditioning for every part. Often down, but never downhearted. Using men, loving men, cheating men. These are the GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933.This is a wonderful comedy - funny, tuneful &amp; easy on the intellect. Plus, the magic of Busby Berkeley's musical numbers. It's the kind of entertainment that kept audiences happy for a few hours during the dark days of economic despair in the early 1930's.The cast is first-rate: brassy Joan Blondell; cynical Aline MacMahon; innocent Ruby Keeler &amp; on-the-make Ginger Rogers. Keeler lands handsome &amp; mysterious Dick Powell, (who gets to croon some attractive Harry Warren tunes); and acerbic but loyal producer Ned Sparks.Warren William &amp; Guy Kibbee turn up late in the proceedings, playing priggish bluenoses who are nonetheless highly susceptible to alcohol &amp; feminine wiles. Movie mavens will recognize Charles Lane as a society reporter; Ferdinand Gottschalk as a disgruntled club member; and Sterling Holloway as a messenger boy.Some years back, in an introduction to a book about THE WIZARD OF OZ's Munchkins, dwarf Billy Barty stated that he was `too young' to appear in that 1939 movie. This, of course, is nonsense, and he can easily be spotted in the `Pettin' In The Park' number here. As he would in FOOTLIGHT PARADE, he rather disturbingly portrays a lecherous tot, a sure indication, if nothing else, that this is a pre-Production Code film.Mr. Berkeley does get to have some fun. The film starts with `We're In The Money' featuring Ginger Rogers &amp; girls clad in coins large &amp; small; Rogers even gets to sing one chorus in pig Latin. `Pettin' In The Dark' extols the joys of bucolic lovemaking, segues to simulated, silhouetted female nudity and rather bizarrely ends with the chorus all metal-corseted (Powell is given a can opener to use on Keeler). `The Shadow Waltz' is Berkeley at his most romantic, with its helix-skirted ladies pretending to play fluorescent, fake violins, all moving in a multitude of weaving patterns staged for the famous overhead camera shots. The film's emotional punch comes at the end, with Blondell's tempestuous rendition of `Remember My Forgotten Man' - with its endless marching men, a blues wail for the doughboys of the Great War, ruined by the Depression. The movie ends on this somber note. (Powell also gets to warble `I've Got To Sing A Torch Song').And just who are those hilarious, Yiddish Kentucky Hillbillies, anyway?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb--one of the 3 best 30s musicals....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>with 42nd Street and Footlight Parade... Snappy, risqué, funny, great cast, great music. What more could you ask for? Joan Blondell, Aline McMahon, and Ruby Keeler are the gold diggers. Warren William, Dick Powell, and Guy Kibbee are their targets. Ginger Rogers is swell singing "We're in the Money" in Pig Latin. Ned Sparks, Sterling Holloway, Charles Lane, and Billy Barty are good. Great musical numbers including the opening "We're in the Money," the terrific finale "Forgotten Man" with Blondell and Etta Moten (singing in the window); "Petting in the Park" and "In a Shadow"---Powell and Keeler.... all classics. Fun all the way...... Look for Hobart Cavanaugh, Grace Hayle, Busby Berkley, Clarence Nordstrom, and one of the roller skating cops sure looks like Jack Carson.Aline McMahon steals the show, and what a show it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forgotten Musical Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mervyn LeRoy directs this irresistible and touching depression-era musical. Busby Berkeley's choreography is as breath-taking as ever, as are the bevy of beautiful women in the elaborate productions. Many great musical numbers highlight this film including "We're in the Money" in which a then unknown, Ginger Rogers sings in Pig Latin. A host of other oddities can be found as always when Mr. Berkeley is involved. Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell are sensational as dancing and singing lovebirds and all works out well in the end. The show does close on a noticeably strange note with the very powerful protest number regarding the depression called "Forgotten Man" masterfully delivered by bombshell, Joan Blondell. A truly original and memorable musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>ereway inay the oneymay!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard of this movie for years, but didn't actually see it until last week when Turner Classic Movies ran it. And it is positively stunning!! On the surface, it moves almost like a carbon copy of 42ND STREET- right up to the last-minute switch in players before the curtain goes up (although in this film, it's Dick Powell instead of Ruby Keeler). But its astringent look at trying to play Tin Pan Alley smack in the middle of the Depression gives it a very adult and tragic significance. It still has the Berkley dazzle- from the "Shadow Waltz" chorus girls (and electric violins) to the now-legendary "We're In The Money" dress rehearsal fronted by a pre-Astaire Ginger Rogers. (I was a teenager when my mother mentioned that one verse of this song was actually sung in Pig Latin- and I swore for twenty-five years that she was pulling my chain. It is one of the cleverest vocal interludes I've ever seen and heard.) But the three girls implied in the film's title- Ruby Keeler, Aline McMahon, and especially the sharp, smart, and gorgeous Joan Blondell- are the best things in the movie. And Blondell fronts the sublime finale number "Forgotten Man-" which pays tribute to the men (and women) of WWI and the ironies which followed. The staging of it- the marching which goes from triumphant to tragic, the torchy, gospel-like vocal of Etta Moten (the black woman sitting in the window), and the pullback shot of everyone coming downstage at the fadeout- is truly spectacular.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Made in the year when the global economic crash hit rock bottom, and the first signs of recovery began to appear, 'Gold Diggers' is very much a product of the Depression. Bread lines and penury are all around, but there is a jaunty air of optimism, too: "the long-lost dollar has come back to the fold".Polly, Trixie and Carol are three vivacious and attractive showgirls who room together and scrape a precarious living by getting hired for each new Broadway musical as it crops up, and riding their luck until it closes - which is often before it even opens. On the fringe of their group hovers Fay, the smart blonde with the waspish tongue (Ginger Rogers).The girls are 'gold diggers' in that they waste no opportunity to batten onto rich men. It is hinted during the course of the film that showgirls inhabit a shadowy region on the borders of prostitution, and the harsh economic realities of 1933 force the girls to regard their good looks as a marketable commodity.A kind of innocent carnality runs through the film. Our three heroines actually sleep together. Fay thinks nothing of changing clothes with Carol, and she gets her backside slapped several times - by both men AND women. Trixie bathes with the door wide open, while Carol preens herself in the scantiest of negligees. The girls contrive to embarrass a rich snob by having him wake up undressed in Carol's bed. The script is loaded with playful smuttiness - taking 'Back Bay codfish' for a ride, making bedroom eyes and so forth.It is in the show numbers, however, that the real naughtiness is on display. Busby Berkeley had had a phenomenal impact earlier in the year with his staged routines for "42nd Street", and a similar (but more risque) format is used here. Girls strip naked in silhouette, Ginger sings and dances all but nude for "We're In The Money", and metal chastity bodices are breached using can openers.Ruby Murray and Dick Powell once again team up as the ingenue lovers, this time playing Brad and Polly - "a knockout for the mush interest". Murray is all coy charm and Powell's tenor voice is magnificent. Ginger is, as always, a beautiful and intelligent performer. Watch her pull off the gibberish verses in 'Money', and breezing through the comic dialogue in the apartment scene. Joan Blondell as Carol is simply adorable. Her sad face during the trick played on Lawrence is enough to tell us that she is falling in love. Her performance as The Spirit Of The Depression in "My Forgotten Man" is one of the great images in cinema history.Warren and Dubin wrote the songs - and what songs! There are amusing, playful numbers like "Pettin' In The Park", with Berkeley choreography to match, and "We're In The Money" is deservedly famous. "In The Shadows" is a lovely ballad, with a set of geodesic walkways and electrically-illuminated violins. The spine-tingling climax is the anthemic "My Forgotten Man"."Pettin' In The Park" was originally intended to be the closing number (hence Polly in her park outfit during the final reel), but the running-order was changed. A reprise of "Pettin'" as aural wallpaper in the restaurant scene is an understated gem, with a lovely arrangement featuring muted cornets. In a nice little in-joke, the producer likes Brad's songs so much, he decides to fire Warren and Dubin. By the way - who is the girl who sits silently in the armchair throughout that long scene?The conception for "My Forgotten Man" was "men marching, marching, marching!" A sweeping epic is told in song and action as we see breadlines, tenements, Great War doughboys and much, much more - all in one song! Joan Blondell deters the heartless cop by pulling back the bum's lapel in a vignette of great emotional power. The musical styles range through torch song, jazz, blues and more. Listen out for the trumpet's counter melody as Joan speaks the verses, the negress on the window sill with the divine alto voice, the clarinet and sax obbligato after each sung line, and the gospel-style descant. "Gee, don't it get ya?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the Warren/Dubin/Berkley musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even better than the splendid "42nd Street," this first of the many "Gold Diggers" films is hitting on all its cylinders. When you have Dick Powell, Ruby Keeler, and Ginger Rogers in the cast, the music of Harry Warren and Al Dubin, AND the choreography of Busby Berkley at his best, how can it be otherwise.Okay, so Ruby Keeler still can't sing on key and her stomping dance style leaves many cold. She does still have that aura of innocence that helped her so much in "42nd Street" and which makes her performance tolerable. She does have the magnificent Joan Blondell and the soon-to-be-legendary Ginger Rogers to fall back on and, believe me, both ladies are more than equal to the task. (I have long believed that Blondell was one of the finest comic actresses in Hollywood history and Ginger Rogers - well, there was a reason Fred Astaire partnered with her more than with any other. No one could do musical comedy and dance better than Rogers at her peak.)Yes, Berkley is an acquired taste. I find much of his later work a bit too precious for my tastes. Here, however, where he was still developing his style, it comes across as fresh and invigorating. Some of the numbers could have used a bit more rehearsal (low budget and a short shooting schedule probably nixed that) but they still all work and some are astonishingly good.Dick Powell is, as usual, splendid and in great voice. Those of us who remember his later career as an award winning dramatic actor and director may not be aware that he was originally a singer - and a damned fine one until cigarette smoking and age took its toll.Many might be a bit shocked by the bawdiness (naughtiness?) of some of the numbers. This was one of the pre-Hayes code films and it one of the reasons why certain groups of viewers were upset. None of it is dirty but some certainly disturbing to the sensitive. (See "Flying Down to Rio" or "Footlight Parade" for other examples of pre-code examples.) I find it all pretty tame but, in 1933, some considered this scandalous and nearly pornographic. We are talking skimpy clothing and innuendo, nothing more, but this was the 1930s and censorship was getting ready to rear its ugly heads. (See Chaplin's masterful "Monsieur Verdoux" for his not-so-subtle jabs at censorship.)"Gold Diggers of 1933" is a certified classic and should not be missed by fans of the musical or early Hollywood. Just remember that its a product of its time and not the present age and enjoy it for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE HAPPY ENDING IS NOT THE END.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a pattern to 1930's Hollywood musicals; struggle to put on show proceeds alongside struggle for love to conquer all. And in the end both struggles are successfully concluded. It is a pattern that is broken by "Gold Diggers Of 1933". Sure, all of the usual elements are in place, including the Hungry, Penniless Showgirl Depression setting. But where this movie differs is in the fact that after the various plot strands are neatly tied up, it doesn't end. Instead, we are treated to the last big production number,"My Forgotten Man", as downbeat as it was possible to get in 30's Hollywood. All the Busby Berkeley musicals paid lip service to the Great Depression, but this one goes much further, as "My Forgotten Man" was the last, most enduring image of the film, and the one that audiences left the theatre with. It's placement was a brave decision on the part of whoever made it, and it would be interesting to learn of the public reaction at the time. Because while it is undoubtedly true that in an era of deprivation, you can't blithely make movies that are totally divorced from reality, it's equally true that people want to be reassured there is a better life, and they won't be scratching around in the dirt forever. Personally, I love the number, and it's placement. It's something that has fascinated me since my very first viewing 7 years ago, but it seems to be a point that not a lot of critics have picked up on. Perhaps it wasn't so unusual after all!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Broadway Girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 (Warner Brothers, 1933), based on the 1919 play by Avery Hopwood, is a worthy follow-up to the recent backstage musical success of "42nd Street" (1933). Previously filmed as a 1923 silent, then an early 1929 musical talkie, "The Golddiggers of Broadway". followed by sequels in name only, "Gold Diggers of 1935, 1937," and "IN Paris," the Hopwood plot was later reworked again by Warners in 1951 in western setting as "Painting the Clouds With Sunshine," with Dennis Morgan, but the 1933 edition, in the opinion of many, is the best of them all. It's one of the few 1930s musicals that can still be seen and appreciated today, thanks to choreographer Busby Berkeley's genius of inventing such remarkable production numbers, and director Mervyn LeRoy's fast-paced story-line.The plot can be categorized in two parts. PART I: Roommate show girls, Carol (Joan Blondell), Trixie (Aline MacMahon), Polly (Ruby Keeler) and Fay (Ginger Rogers), give up their present jobs in order to appear in Barney Hopkins' (Ned Sparks) latest musical revue, FORGOTTEN MELODY. Barney wants to do a show about the Depression. In the meantime he is introduced to Brad (Dick Powell), an unknown composer, by Polly who loves him. Brad so happens to have the score Barney wants to use for the upcoming show. After rehearsals comes opening night. The juvenile leading man (Clarence Nordstrom) is unable to go on and Brad is chosen to take his place. After the show clicks, Brad and Polly become overnight stars. PART II: Millionaire snob J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William), and his family attorney, Peabody (Guy Kibbee) arrive in New York from Boston in order to prevent Brad, J. Lawrence's younger brother, from disgracing the family name by appearing in the shows and getting himself mixed up with show girls, who have the reputation of being nothing but "chisslers, parasites and gold diggers." Because Brad wants a career in the theater and to now marry Polly, he refuses to listen to his brother. J. Lawrence decides to break up the relationship by meeting Polly and buying her off, but instead he meets Carol and mistakes her for Polly. Carol and Trixie decide to J. Lawrence and Peabody "for a ride" and "gold dig" their way into their wallets. Beginning and ending with production numbers, the movie opens with "We're in the Money" sung by Ginger Rogers both in English and in Pig Latin; followed by Dick Powell crooning "The Shadow Waltz" to Ruby Keeler from across her apartment window. Powell then sings the beautiful tune, "I've Got to Sing a Torch Song" while auditioning for Sparks. That song is underscored during the film's love scenes and tender moments. The stage shows include the lively and racy "Pettin' in the Park," followed by chorus girls in hoop skirts playing neon violins to "The Shadow Waltz," ending with the Depression theme, "Remember My Forgotten Man" a dark and moody number with Joan Blondell (wearing tight blouse and skirt)/sung by black singer Etta Moten, underscored in serious tone presenting dough-boy soldiers fighting at the front during World War I, and returning home to the states finding themselves hit by the Depression, becoming homeless and unemployed. Only Berkeley could take a very lively movie and end it like this. Of the four show girls in the story, only Ginger Rogers has little to do. Aline MacMahon and Guy Kibbee make an excellent "odd couple." Powell and Keeler continue to delight with their innocent charm, while sassy Blondell and no nonsense William make go with their love/hate relationship.While musicals have a reputation for having thin plots and strong production numbers, or visa versa, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 is strong on both counts and entertains throughout its full 96 minutes. Mistaken identity plot par excellence make this a breezy and merry affair. There are some Hollywood "in jokes" here that some viewers might not understand, with pre-production code risqué dialogue and scenes that will open many eyes before beginning to chuckle with amusement. Look for it. Excellent score by Harry Warren and Al Dubin, with choreography by Busby Berkeley, make this one movie musical of the 1930s highly recommended to be seen and enjoyed, if above all else.

		<shortDescription>Ever seen me ride a pony?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the greatest movie musicals of all time. Some would say the best of them all, including the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers and Gene Kelly classics. It is one of the few musicals of the 1930's and 40's that ventured to include social commentary and social criticism with the comedy and music. The "Remember My Forgotten Man" number is one of the best, some would say the best, choreographed song and dance of them all. It is sort of icing on the cake coming as it does near the end of this amazing film. Arthur Penn's "Bonnie and Clyde" would use the "We're in the Money" opening number as a backdrop to emphasize the irony of the outlaws' dilemma, since most persons living in the southwest in 1933 were certainly not "in the money." The only one actually watching the movie is Bonnie. "Gold Diggers" is filled with New Deal aphorisms. I have never read anything about the new President FDR's reaction to "Gold Diggers," but I'm sure it was a positive one, since it helped promote his economic ideas concerning recovery as outlined in the writings of British economist John Maynard Keynes. There are so many goodies in "Gold Diggers" that it is easy to miss many of them on first viewing. Many throwaway lines are gems. For example, when Barney (Ned Sparks) is hyping his new musical that he will make if he can only get the money together, he beams, "Why, it's the funniest thing you've ever seen." One of the hoofers replies sarcastically, "I don't know, have you ever seen me ride a pony?"This was the apex of Busby Berkeley's career. He came close a few times but never reached the lofty heights of "We're In The Money," "Pettin' in the Park" and "Remember My Forgotten Man." Tunesmiths Warren and Dubin reached their apogee as well. This is one of those rare animals where everything down to the minutest item jells. It is a winner all the way. Strange that the only true gold digger in the film is Ginger Rogers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Slightly More Serious Tone With The Finale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though my favorite Busby Berkeley film is Footlight Parade, Gold Diggers of 1933 certainly has a lot to recommend it even for audiences today.The Goldiggers in this case are three female room mates, Aline McMahon, Joan Blondell, and Ruby Keeler. Keeler has a big crush on a struggling songwriter across the hall from them who of course is Dick Powell. He writes some good songs, so good that he gets the invitation to write a whole musical show from producer Ned Sparks. But he refuses to sing and star in the show as well.Come opening night and unlike 42nd Street where Ruby Keeler had to step in for an injured star, here it's Powell who reluctantly steps in on opening night after getting a lecture from Joan Blondell about what it means to all the company who will be once again out of work during the Great Depression.Poverty isn't something that Powell readily grasps. He's really a trust fund baby from a prominent Boston blue blood family and they don't like the idea of one of them in show business. Powell's brother and head of the clan Warren William gets wind of what Powell's been doing and threatens to cut him off and cut off the budding romance with Keeler.In step Blondell and McMahon who go after William and family lawyer Guy Kibbee. The situations they put these two in are pretty hilarious and quite a commentary on the prevailing morality of the day.For the most part Gold Diggers of 1933 is the typical escapist fare that Warner Brothers musicals usually were. But unlike the other Gold Digger films this one takes a serious turn. More mention here is made of the Great Depression than in the others.Also in that Remember My Forgotten Man finale that must have struck a resonant chord with the audience of 1933. A year before World War I veterans were dispersed from Washington where they had encamped demanding payment of a promised bonus with tear gas. That incident probably sealed the re-election chances of President Herbert Hoover who was on the rocks already. That imagery conveyed by Busby Berkeley of those marching men going clockwise and counterclockwise in a kaleidoscope is riveting today, I can only imagine what it was like for contemporary audiences.Harry Warren and Al Dubin wrote a fine score with Remember My Forgotten Man sung by Joan Blondell, WE're in the Money sung by Ginger Rogers and a female chorus and Dick Powell singing I've Got to Sing a Torch Song, Shadow Waltz and Pettin' in the Park the last two with Ruby Keeler.Powell also made records of his songs and We're in the Money. I've Got to Sing a Torch Song and Shadow Waltz were also recorded by up and coming radio and film crooner Bing Crosby. Bing's version of I've Got to Sing a Torch Song is one of his best early records.The wonderful fantasy musical numbers of Busby Berkeley will never go out of style and some of the best are right here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While certainly not the most riveting movie to come out of Hollywood during it's golden era, it certainly is one of the most fun ones. My favorite of the Busby Berkeley/Warner Bros. musicals it is the quintessential backstage musical. While the story is secondary to Berkeley's numbers, the movie's premise is about four chorus girls trying to find work during the height of the depression. Show after show gets canceled when the girls finally get a rich financier posing as a poor song writer, played by Dick Powell, to back a new production. Warren William does an excellent job as always playing the brother and benefactor of Dick Powell's character. Ruby Keeler has always been much maligned but I she is not as bad as advertised. And Dick Powell while an excellent singer, is no Spencer Tracy.The four major numbers include the cheery "We're in the Money" with Ginger Rogers proclaiming that "old man depression is through". However the depression rears it's ugly head when the police have to interrupt the rehearsal and shutdown production due to debt."Pettin in the Park" is a racy number by 1933 standards (you can definitely tell this movie is pre-code Hollywood), featuring Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler this song preaches that getting affectionate with your loved one in public ain't so bad."The Shadow Waltz" is a visually pleasing masterpiece to say the least. Featuring Powell and Keeler again and a countless number of chorines with neon violins, it is more spectacular then anything modern day special effects can produce."Remember my Forgotten Man" with the lovely Joan Blondell is a change of pace. More serious, more subdued it is a powerful reminder of how important our dough boys were just 15 years or so earlier.Featuring an all star cast, a capable director and the genius of Busby Berkeley Gold Diggers of 1933 is one of the best musicals to come out of Hollywood during the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Forgotten melody"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Hollywood's most successful collaborative era, sometimes the best things happened by accident. Gold Diggers of 1933 was set to be a routine backstage romantic comedy, but after the runaway success of 42nd street with its spectacular dance numbers choreographed by Busby Berkely, studio heads decided to make a few changes and shoehorn in some Berkely routines. What should have been a mess, turned out to be a masterpiece. You see, it happened by accident, but not without overwhelming creative genius from all corners.First of all let's disregard Berkely for a moment and consider the bones of the picture. This was a golden age for Warner Brothers, and even their potboilers tended to be meaty offerings. The broad plot may be a simple comedy of errors, but the minutiae and the dialogue are unashamedly frank about the depression, then at its very worst point. The fact that the comic escapades are backed by very real and harsh truths gives an unexpected layer of poignancy to the proceedings. Yes, the man-baiting escapades of three money-hungry chorus girls makes for riotous entertainment, but we are never allowed to forget how they became money-hungry.The director is Mervyn LeRoy, who despite his youth was one of the most competent and professional filmmakers on the Warners payroll. He directs Gold Diggers with pace and punch, never allowing the action to slow down and become dull, but still keeping everything in clarity. A neat little trick of his is using depth to keep certain characters on display. For example, in the scene where Don Gordon (the perpetual juvenile lead) is doubled up with lumbago, Gordon and Ned Sparks are in the foreground, but Dick Powell is prominently placed in the background. Gordon is the most important character at that precise moment, so it is logical to have him up front, but Powell is more important in the long run as he will soon replace Gordon, so it is necessary for us to remember him at that time.The cast is one to die for, or at the very least, go to prison for. Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler are ostensibly the leads, but the show really belongs to Joan Blondell and Aline MacMahon. Powell was a great singer, and Keeler a wonderful dancer, but neither of them could act well. And thankfully, while they are prominent in the song and dance numbers, they are really supporting players in the drama. Blondell was prolific in both musicals and melodramas of this time, but tended to play "best friend" type roles rather than leading ladies. Gold Diggers is her chance to shine, and show what a terrific actress she is. She plays things at a fairly muted level, but there is a lot of emotion going on under the surface. When she appears in the Forgotten Man number she not only becomes a singer, she carries on being an actress. MacMahon at first looks a little out of place amongst all the sweet and delicate chorines, but as soon as she gets to work her magic on Guy Kibbee she dominates the screen and you know exactly why she was cast. A young Ginger Rogers is here too, still getting villainous roles thanks to her mean-looking face, but nevertheless proving herself to be a superb performer. Ned Sparks gives perhaps his deepest and most heartfelt performance, without ever once breaking out of his trademark character. Amid all these sparkling jewels, there are some memorable bit parts by the likes Ferdinand Gottschalk and Sterling Holloway, yet more pearls in the Gold Diggers crown.And at last we come to the music. Of course, the melodies of Harry Warren are simply divine, the lyrics of Al Dubin cheeky and incisive as ever, and the choreography of Busby Berkely absolutely breathtaking, but it's how the whole thing is fitted together that puts Gold Diggers so far ahead of its peers. Most of the Berkely musicals "stacked" the numbers - that is, put them all together at the end as a grand finale. That worked fine for 42nd Street and Footlight Parade, but for Gold Diggers of 1933 the structure is geared to awesome effect. We open with "We're in the Money", a lively slice of irony casually wishing the depression away. "Pettin' in the Park" gives us a little comical boost in the middle of the picture. "Shadow Waltz" is pure Berkely indulgence, lovely to look at but with nothing that will unbalance the end of the picture emotionally. And finally, "Remember My Forgotten Man" drops us right into the realities of the depression. It is a bitter counterpoint to "We're in the Money" and its impact is utterly devastating.Gold Diggers of 1933 is not only the finest of the Busby Berkely musicals, not only the pinnacle of Warner Brothers' pre-code licentiousness, it is the very heart of depression-era America. "Can't you hear that wailing?" Ned Sparks asks us, as Dick Powell hammers out a rough version of "Forgotten Man". You'll hear it alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very enjoyable movie set during the depression.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now this is actually a movie that lives up to its reputation. It's a greatly fun musical comedy, with a good story, fun characters and great musical moments. It features some true classic musical songs.It's next to a musical also really a comedy. Not the usual slapstick '30's style of comedy but the more sort of 'fun' comedy, with good comical dialog and character's chemistry. And then considering that the movie is set in- and involves a story around the great depression of the '30's. What makes the fun level of the movie work out so well are the girls. They are really the main characters of the movie and all have some good chemistry together and all an own great strong and entertaining personality.The acting is quite good, especially considering 1933 standards and despite not having any real big names in it.It's a really well made movie, with lots of pace and class. It makes the movie effective on many levels. It's very effective on the musical level due to its fine musical numbers and grand looking choreography of it all. It's also very effective on its comical level and also with its story it is trying to tell, as well as all of its romantic aspects involved. It also makes this an effective movie about the great '30's depression. The movie is basically a great combination of all of these effective elements and there is a great balance between all of it. So there is basically something for everyone to enjoy.Delightful, entertaining, sparkling musical comedy!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The second entry in the Warren-Dubin-Berkeley Warner Bros. musical series is almost as good as 42ND STREET. The plot is rather too silly to hold our undivided interest through the mid-section of the film but the cast is attractive and varied enough to keep us watching. Ginger Rogers in particular has seldom if ever looked so scrumptious.Early in the proceedings there is a scene in the golddiggers' apartment where dour, penniless producer Ned Sparks launches into a speech about the necessity of producing a whole musical show about the Depression, focusing on the "forgotten men," down-and-out World War I veterans who had made headlines in the summer of 1932 when they marched on Washington demanding early payment of government bonuses previously pledged to them. The first half of the script is filled with references to hard times. Audiences today may be impressed with this full-on recognition of the Depression, but they should be aware that Warner Bros. may well have been inspired to tackle this issue in a musical by AMERICANA, a Broadway revue that ran in late 1932 (several months before this film was made) and featured the E.Y. Harburg-Jay Gorney ballad "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" which became a mega-hit and in fact is now considered "the anthem of the Depression." "Dime" and the revue that spawned it were openly focused on "the forgotten man." In this film, the Dick Powell character - the composer/lyricist who writes "My Forgotten Man" - explains that he got the idea from walking past the breadlines in Times Square. That is almost exactly the explanation given by Gorney and Harburg about why they wrote "Dime." In this sense, Broadway beat Hollywood to the punch in depicting a serious reality of the times, but Hollywood, as usual, was quick to catch on, imitate and cash in. The Warren-Dubin song "My Forgotten Man" is lyrically and musically slightly less artful than "Dime" but works brilliantly on screen with the visual element and clever casting, ending with a spectacular flourish. In a way, it's "Brother, Can You Spare a Dime?" from a female onlooker's point of view. The context of this film is as interesting as its content. Just imagine: an era in which Broadway set the tone and took the lead in popular culture. Nowadays Broadway trails miles and miles behind TV, movies and popular music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The archetypal 1930s musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At last! The best of the Berkeley movies have made it onto DVD. It's just a shame that the politically-incorrect WONDER BAR wasn't included in this selection at least in the name of completeness.As has been noted by others, this film didn't start out as a musical and the Busby Berkeley sequences were added to the completed film after the monumental success of the earlier 42ND STREET. But you'd never know it. This has been one of my favourite 30s musicals since I was a teenager and it had never once occurred to me that the musical numbers had been added as an afterthought.And though the plot is very similar to that of 42ND STREET, GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 stands up as a time capsule of the era. The performances are perky, with special shouts going out to Ginger and Joan. I've never been a fan of Ruby Keeler and I'm unable to see in her what 1930s audiences must have seen. She couldn't sing or dance half as well as Ginger, but of course, Ginger went on to a stellar career as the best-loved of Fred Astaire's partners and Ruby didn't.Also a revelation is Dick Powell as the "juvenile lead" in the in-film stage show. Though better known to audiences as the tough Philip Marlowe of MURDER MY SWEET, this is where he got his start and it's telling that, along with James Cagney and any number of other Hollywood stars of the era, Powell was able to sing and tap dance with the best of them. If only today's stars were so multi-talented.Overall, an absolutely terrific, energetic snapshot of life during the Great Depression. Thank god I didn't have to live through it, but also thank god for those who did and left us this fascinating glimpse of what it must've been like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>musical romance with humor, pageantry, and an ending number that came from outer space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw this for the first time last night on TCM. A strange and funny big musical romance with humor, pageantry and an ending number that came from outer space. Weird and Wonderful. This was made the same year as the more famous ?42nd Street.' These girls...Joan Blondell,Aline MacMahon,and Ruby Keeler are self sufficient and efficient at getting what they need to survive. The plot reminded me of the later movie, ?How To Marry A Millionaire' with Betty Grable, Marilyn Monroe, and Lauren Bacall. It's the...where have I heard this story before...of three down on their luck women falling for three men with money...but of course they all have to start out hating each other first. I adore the scene where the show girls decide to trick the Boston banker society men and get their new luncheon hats delivered C.O.D. I also enjoyed the art work on the walls of the girls apartment and the fact that they all slept in bed together because they could barely pay rent on a one bedroom. The story is greatly enhanced by the fact that it's pre-code and therefore pretty risque. Makes for some great laughs. And I do remember my flapper grandmother behaving terribly women's libby like long before they had a name for it. This movie is also made alluring by the genius choreography of Busby Berkeley. I just flipped over the dance sequence with the neon violins. While watching , at first I was stunned thinking they were painted with the glow in the dark phosphorescent material that caused cancer. I was happy to read on the Internet they were actually neon lights...can you imagine the expense and difficulty of dancing in the dark with all those wires?There are several other really wild scenes including one in which the dancing girls get caught in the rain and strip down to nearly nothing behind a big silk curtain before redressing into metal corsets! Remember, this was before the days of LSD! But without a doubt the strangest scene came at the end when the main character sings the soulful jazz number called ?The Forgotten Man' about the WWI vets who all came home to find out there was a huge depression, there wasn't any work, and they were reduced to begging for food in bread lines. How this melancholy but beautiful tribute to the truth ever got slapped on to the end of this movie is a total editing security breach...but wow was it a powerful one! I do not think this movie is available on DVD yet, but if you get to watch it on late night TV be sure it's on a station that does not cut or edit scenes because it's a piece of cinema history.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gold Diggers of 1933 is everything I would look forward to in a musical. The music is wonderful, and the cinematography is way ahead of its time. The musical numbers sport effects that are almost magical to the point of being Fantasia-like and Billy Barty even makes an appearance in his first role as a child on Broadway. The musical scenes are the most memorable, as women come together to form shapes like flowers and florescent violins. The story is cute and I would make this one a part of my collection. -Joeyfro</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gold Diggers of 1933 is a musical worth remembering both for entertaining and historical reasons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After maybe about 15 years, I finally got to watch Gold Diggers of 1933 again and boy, it's even better than I remembered it! First off, there's the wonderfully fantastic opening number "We're in the Money" as warbled by Ginger Rogers in a skimpy coins costume especially as she also sings it in Pig Latin making it such an iconic scene to this day (I also remember it being presented as a lottery commercial in Jacksonville, Florida, when I lived there during the '90s). Then after the rehearsal is closed because of lack of funds, producer Ned Sparks then, months later, proposes to the other chorus girls a show about the Depression of which songwriter Dick Powell already has a song for but no words yet. By the way, the other girls are Joan Blondell, Aline MacMahon, and Ruby Keeler. Also, Sparks says a couple of ironic lines like "Cancel my contract with Warren and Dubin!" of which he meant the songwriting team of Harry and Al who wrote all the songs in this movie, and then comparing the team of Powell and Keeler to the Astaires on Broadway of which one of them, Fred, would eventually find a new partner in Ms. Rogers, who was in this scene, at RKO later in the year. There's also Warren William and Guy Kibbee in support of which the latter plays a similar role here as he did in 42nd Street except here, he's not in charge of the finances of the show nor does he ever realize he's being used by Ms. MacMahon. Oh, and while Ms. Rogers eventually became his new ingénue in 42nd Street, here she never gets the chance! Oh, and as a fan of It's a Wonderful Life, I have to note that Charles Lane, who was the one who told Mr. Potter about George Bailey's plans for Bailey Park, was the writer in 42nd Street and is the society reporter here who finds out about Dick Powell's real-life status. Powell, himself, is quite fine here whether singing "Pettin' in the Park" with Keeler-hey, get a load of 9-year old Billy Barty pulling the curtains as those girls are dressing up!-or being involved in the machinations of humiliating brother William. As for Berkeley, well, he tops himself here with not only the "Money" number but also another one involving neon violins and then there's the "Forgotten Man" number as first recited in spoken word by Ms. Blondell before segueing to Etta Molen singing those same words as we see many former World War I soldiers marching in the rain before those same men then end up on long lines at the soup kitchen before Joan then sings (through Marian Anderson's voice) the harrowing coda. Very powerful number to end a movie and it still feels heartbreaking just remembering it. So with all that, Gold Diggers of 1933 is not only still very funny and entertaining, it's also something worth thinking about when one remembers the era it was made and set in...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Come and meet those dancing feet....if the show opens, that is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"We'll make people laugh at you starving to death!" deadpan Ned Sparks tells tall, lanky showgirl Aline MacMahon. "The depression, dearie", Ginger Rogers sarcastically reminds another chorus girl as to why their show is closing. Audiences then wouldn't get to see Ginger giving her pig-Latin version of "We're in the Money" as the camera scrolls down the list of Broadway theaters all dark due to the lack of angels funding shows. While Broadway was not as dark in 1933 as the movie makes this out to be (just check out the "Best Plays" series for the seasons 1932/33 and 1933/34), things did look pretty dismal for a while. This is the best musical made about the depression, focusing on chorus girls MacMahon, Rogers, Joan Blondell and Ruby Keeler, all unemployed after Sparks' previous show closed before opening, and the hope that his new show (with the help of mysterious songwriter Dick Powell) will actually open. And when Powell's banker brother (Warren William) steps in to get his brother away from Broadway and prevent him from marrying one of the chorus girls, the "gold diggers" get together to teach William a lesson. Smart Joan Blondell poses as Powell's fiancée (who is actually Keeler) and wins William's affection in the process. MacMahon makes a play for "daddy" Guy Kibbee, whom she nicknames "Fanny", warning Rogers to keep her paws off him or else...This follow-up to "42nd Street" is actually better than its predecessor, even though "42nd Street" is excellent in itself. To say that a movie goes "beyond excellence" is a rare comment on a film, and this is one that I never tire of watching. There are so many moments of this film that step beyond greatness that I can't mention them all. But try these few on for size. A secretary threatens to complain to the agency for Sparks dismissing her so early. "I wish there was someone I could complain to", he tells her. After a troop of hillbilly singers try to finagle an audition, he decides to close up the office before "the jugglers and midgets get there." It is so hard not to laugh so loud that you end up missing the next joke. Try not to fall head over heels in love with Aline MacMahon, the gold-digger with a huge heart of gold. The scene where she tells off Powell (whom she believes has a criminal past) and warns him about what fate could befall the girls of the chorus is one of the most honest pieces of acting I've seen in any film. Watch Blondell melt under William's spell after being so tough up until then. The scene where Blondell and MacMahon each make William and Kibbee buy them hats is also another great moment. Veteran comic Sterling Holloway ("Winnie the Pooh") is hysterically funny as one of the delivery boys.As for the songs, there is not one dud among them, which is why a few of them ended up in "42nd Street" almost 50 years later on Broadway. I would love to have seen someone try to stage "Pettin' in the Park" even close to how Busby Berkley stages it here. Billy Barty is used to great comical advantage as the toddler. The song is sort of a prequel to "42nd Street's" "Shuffle Off to Buffalo", which itself had a sequel, "Honeymoon Hotel", in the same year's follow-up, "Footlight Parade". I actually like Ruby Keeler's singing voice; It is far from perfect, but is a nice contrast to other musical stars of this era. "The Shadow Waltz" is one of the great visual numbers of film history. And when Joan Blondell (who did a few musicals on-stage) gets to talk/sing the final, "My Forgotten Man", she sums up what the entire film has been all about. While America may never have a depression like they did in the 30's, the themes of the film resonate today, making this an important record of one of our greatest domestic crisis in our history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-code masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterpiece from 1933 is one of the best examples I've seen of early Hollywood exploitation, although by today's standards if you didn't already know it was controversial at the time you probably wouldn't notice. With the introduction of the talkies in the late 1920's, Hollywood seemed unable to control various movies using subtle innuendos, and actresses displaying a bit more skin than they should until the Hays Code came into full force in 1934, which enforced the boundaries as to what was deemed acceptable on screen. Gangsters profited from crime, women displayed their legs, and in the case of Gold Diggers Of 1933, women used their sexuality to conquer men and gain what they wanted.Set during the Depression, it follows a quartet of stage dancers after their show is stopped due to the creative director failing to pay the bills. Things look on the up when the girls are asked to return for a brand new show, which would tackle the effects of the Depression on the common man and the state of the country. The enthusiastic director Barney (Ned Sparks) overhears the girls' neighbour Brad (Dick Powell) crooning a tune playing his piano, and invites him to play more tunes and eventually write the score for the upcoming musical. Barney also needs a lot of money to fund, something that Brad is happy to pay in case, much to the girls' suspicion.It comes across as a film with two halves - the first focusing on the development of the musical, the relationship between Brad and dancer Polly (Ruby Keeler), and the confusion surrounding the shady Brad's situation. The second seeing fellow dancers Carol (Joan Blondell) and Trixie's (Aline MacMahon) attempts to squeeze as much cash as possible out of Barney's upper-class brother Lawrence (a brilliant Warren William) and bumbling Peabody (Guy Kibbee). The first is a masterclass of beautiful stage numbers, fantastic songs, and good old-fashioned escapism. The second is where the film hits full stride, providing laugh out loud situations and some verbal comedy that wouldn't look out place today, as the girls flirt with and tease the old men as we cheer them on. It's the kind of thing that Sex And The City wishes it could pull off when it isn't being so materialistic and soulless.When you think it's over it pulls off one last masterstroke in the highly effective 'Remember My Forgotten Man' musical number, as Joan Blondell sings about how her man fought for her country and now begs for food and resorts to picking up discarded cigarette butts, as bloody soldiers march through the street. It's a beautiful moment and really sums up the era. It offers an insight into the whole Pre-Code Hollywood movement, where people would go to the cinema to escape their everyday struggles to see an actress like Blondell revealing a bit more leg than she should, or a Pre-Code veteran such as Warren William sneer his way through some juicy lines and villainous roles. It gave the general public that little something extra to get excited about.This is a film that has everything, and if you can track it down I would urge you to see it. It's a fascinating time capsule, and even has a very early role for Ginger Rogers as the flirty Fay. It has also been entered into the National Film Registry for preservation by the Library of Congress. A must-see.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic pre-Code musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chorus girls Carol (Joan Blondell), Pollu (Ruby Keeler) and Trixie (Aline McMahon) all room together but can't find a job. Because of the Depression nobody can afford to put on a musical. However piano player Brad (Dick Powell) can help someone put on a musical and that leads to a big hit show. There's more to the plot than that but who really cares? This movie was done to show some incredibly elaborate Busby Berkley numbers and it DOES give you that!Right from the slam-bang opening of Ginger Rogers singing "We're in the Money" (with one entire verse in Pig Latin!) this movie never stops. It moves VERY quickly, there's tons of overlapping dialogue and there are plenty of wisecracks and risqué jokes (mostly from McMahon). This is also an odd musical that uses the Depression as a main plot focus--back in 1933 people went to see musicals to FORGET about the Depression! The elaborate Berkley musical numbers are incredible to watch--especially "Pettin in the Park" and the one with all the chorus girls having glow in the dark violins! Also it ends on a downbeat note with the depressing "Remember My Forgotten Man" number. Still this isn't TOO depressing---just very interesting. Easily one of the best musical from the 1930s. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the best of the Berkeley musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While "42nd Street" gets most of the acclaim today I think that "Gold Diggers of 1933" may be the best all-around effort among the Busby Berkeley musicals. The story concerns a Boston blue blood songwriter who finances a Broadway show and ends up taking the stage at the last minute. However, when his brother hears about his undignified behaviour he comes to town in order to put an end to his newfound career &amp; romance.The cast is a fine one which produces several entertaining performances. A number of the actors are "42nd Street" alumni, including Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks &amp; Ginger Rogers. Warren William, Joan Blondell &amp; Aline MacMahon join them to make up an enviable cast.Mervyn LeRoy was in the director's chair and he did a pretty good job but the obvious attraction here is Busby Berkeley's peerless musical numbers featuring the music of Warren &amp; Dubin. From the opening number "We're in the Money" to the visual splendour of "Pettin' in the Park" &amp; "The Shadow Waltz" it's clear that we're seeing and hearing something special. However, I question the use of "Remember My Forgotten Man" as the closer since I consider it the weakest and least 'fun' of the numbers.Minor complaints aside, "Gold Diggers of 1933" is an entertaining musical containing some stellar work from Busby Berkeley along with catchy songs from Warren &amp; Dubin. Unlike some of the other Berkeley musicals the story here is more than just an excuse to show some musical numbers, which I think elevates it above the pack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, what an astounding movie. I don't know when I've enjoyed a movie more than this. Sure, there are lots of movies I would say are greater, more worthwhile, and more moving, but "enjoyable" is not the first adjective that comes to mind when you are watching, say, Shindler's List. Nor should it be. But this one .... a pure delight! From the opening number of "We're in the Money" to the closing "Forgotten Man," I just can't say enough in praise. Oh yes, there's an entertaining, rather risqué plot in the middle too. It almost doesn't matter. Joan Blondel is gorgeous, Ruby Keeler is captivating, and Ginger Rogers is a delight. And Busby Berkeley proves himself to be an unrivaled creative genius. The number with the illuminated violins is amazing. The closing number, "Forgotten Man", is powerful.Not good enough for you yet? How about a group of naked sexy young women illuminated behind a screen? This is truly the musical for people who don't like musicals.- henry</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful, brash, funny and pertinent Depression-era Warners musical, with the musical numbers famously directed by genius choreographer Busby Berkeley. "We're In The money" sets up this terrific movie, an attention-grabbing number that immediately overloads the audience with dazzling visuals. From the sexy "Pettin In The Park" to the quite astonishing "Shadow Waltz" (complete with glowing violins- see the electric wires!), Berkeley sure lives up to his reputation as a master. His trademark kaleidoscope shots of chorus girls are beautiful. The film is not only a great musical-comedy...it is a document of the Great Depression. The haunting "Remember My Forgotten Man" is justly the most remembered number in the film, with soldiers marching off to fight in the Great War juxtaposed with the breadlines in the Great Depression.Looking at the acting, I must say that Ruby Keeler had one of the more fascinating careers of any performer. Plucky Keeler is cute and likable, but, as she readily admitted, she wasn't much of a singer, actress or dancer. And she was a big Warners musical star in the early 30's. However, Joan Blondell is wonderful and Ginger Rogers threatens to steal the film whenever she appears. Heck, I think she may have stolen it when she did the Pig Latin! It's a pity she only had a minor supporting role. If the Best Supporting Actress category was around in 1933, Aline McMahon was a shoe-in, a delicious comic performance. The men? Dick Powell is very watchable, but Warren William is as stiff as a board. I see he was one of the most popular pre-code men. Maybe in the other films he was in he projects a personality, but here he doesn't. Lucky Miss Blondell is so great opposite him, otherwise I couldn't take him at all!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1933 classic directed by Mervyn LeRoy brings the viewer back to the simple style of dance. Busby Berkeley directed and choreographed the dance scenes in Gold Diggers of 1933. The film portrays more of a behind the stage point of view from a group of dancers, producers, choreographers, composers and show people, struggling during the depression to not only make ends meat but to pursue careers which provided them with happiness. The basic plot is to jump start a production in the works with half written compositions of music and zero funding available at such a financially unstable period of time.The film starts out depicting three female dancers who are out of work and stealing milk through their neighbor's window. I enjoyed this scene because it shows how desperate and depressed characters Polly, Carol, and Trixie truly felt at the time. I enjoyed how they had a personal challenge as to who got to attend an audition when rumors about a show were surfacing. The girls picked types of taxi cabs checkered and colored. Whichever taxi came first that girl got to wear the one nice outfit in their possession, which was Carol's uniform from work, and go to the audition. Also I noticed considering it was a black and white movie the director had the checkered taxi cab to be the winner because a colored taxi would not be able to be deciphered on film as a checkered one would.The film was risqué for the 1930's. In the scene Petting in the Park a small perverted child runs around after the girls, egging on the men to pursue them. There were a few elements in this scene which I found humorous. The director used camera angles for the child, the girls and the audiences' point of view. Using stage lights and a large white curtain LeRoy was able to project the illusion of the girls undressing, while the small child drew up the curtain to reveal presumably naked girls. I was amused in that when the curtain was lifted the girls were wearing metal outfits. Robert, the mysterious donator of funds to the show and love interest of Polly also performs in the show. Petting in the park ends with Polly sitting on a bench in the park with her back to Robert who is holding a scissor cutting through the metal outfit to finish off this comical scene.Overall Gold Diggers of 1933 portrays the hard work and struggle men and woman on Broadway put into their lives and shows. While the dancing was not too spectacular and fairly simple, the basic plot was very enjoyable. I feel that to take time to view this film gives you insight in both the depression and hardships of the 1930's but also the happiness and joy of dancing, singing and performing on Broadway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Gold Diggers of 1933 is a great pre-code film with Joan Blondell, Dick Powell, and Ginger Rogers. The plot of the film is predictable and cliche, but the cast, director, and music scores add new life to an old theme. Aline MacMahon and Joan Blondell add great witty comic flare to the film. It's always interesting to watch pre-code films and the roles women played in them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a gloriously amoral and funny film about girls on the make. There is one line in it that somehow crept past the censors (unless they didn't get it, of course). The costumes are grand, and dear Ruby Keeler is her usual squeaky virginal self - which is more than can be said for any of the other young ladies. This is a musical which is of great delight to devotees of the period and of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Depression musical starring some of the usual suspects</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the success of "42nd Street," Warner Brothers wasted no time adding Busby Berkeley musical numbers to "Gold Diggers of 1933." Starring Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, this musical also has some of the same Depression darkness that permeated "42nd Street." "It's the Depression, dearie," Ginger Rogers says as the show she and her fellow chorines are laboring in closes in rehearsal due to lack of funding. However, Brad (Powell), a composer in a nearby apartment who's sweet on Polly (Keeler), offers to give Ned Sparks the money he needs to produce his new show. His only condition is that Polly be featured. Everyone wonders where he got the money, and a news item plus the fact that he refuses to appear in the show make the girls suspicious that he's a bank robber. In fact, he's the scion of a wealthy man (Warren William), who soon appears on the scene with his attorney (Guy Kibbee) when Brad steps in for the lumbago-ridden juvenile lead. Polly's roommates Trixie and Carol (Joan Blondell and Aline MacMahon) go to work on the two immediately.Though the film has some fantastic numbers - "We're in the Money," "The Shadow Waltz," "Pettin' in the Park," and great Busby Berkeley choreography, the middle section has no music and drags on as the gals meet the men, get them to pay for expensive hats, etc. This is probably because the film was completed when the musical numbers were added. But the final number is worth the whole film. "Remember Your Forgotten Man" is a tribute to the World War I soldiers now out of work in the Depression, and not only are the production effects and choreography fantastic, but the singing as well, particularly the solo work by Etta Morton. Blondell, who from the sound of it in Dames was completely tone deaf, is beautifully dubbed here.Ginger Rogers shines in a supporting role especially with her pig Latin lyrics to "We're in the Money" which were added after she was heard fooling around in a rehearsal. Powell is in gorgeous voice in all the numbers, but "I've Got to Sing a Torch Song" is a high point.It's easy to watch the dancing, the beautiful women in their costumes, and listen to the singing and forget what in fact was going on in the '30s - after all, that's why these films were made. But the "Forgotten Man" number serves as a reminder then and today that for the people sitting in the theaters, their troubles were right outside the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, joyful, depression era musical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Gold Diggers of 1933", after the cast has been introduced, the first beautiful face you see is that of Ginger Rogers. Pre-Fred (they would be teamed later in the year in "Flying Down To Rio"). And she is a truly radiant beauty with a huge smile. She belts out one of the signature songs of the 1930's, "We're In The Money". At one point of the song she sings an entire chorus of the song in Pig Latin. That's right, Pig Latin. And we're off to the races.This movie, following the success of "42nd Street" was developed in an obvious attempt to get the audience to forget the harsh times they were living in for 98 minutes and just let go and enjoy themselves. And right from the start that happens. Even 70 years later, we still find ourselves in trying times, and this movie lovingly enables you to forget "life" for a while, and surrender to it's wonderful music and humor.The cast is first rate. Especially Ned Sparks as the producer, Ginger Rogers as Fay Fortune, Guy Kibbee as "Fanny", and Joan Blondell, who looks very sexy during the finale, "The Forgotten Man".And the score by Warren and Dubin(who is not credited for some reason) is perfect. "The Forgotten Man"(a "Brother, Can You Spare A Dime" knockoff), "We're In The Money", "Got To Sing A Torch Song", and one of my favorites, "Shadow Waltz".Yes, it's a musical. Yes, it's fluff. Yes, it's badly dated. Yes, it's a 98 minute cliché. Who cares?! This is a must see for any film enthusiast. Sit back, relax and I dare you to try not to enjoy this film.8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ginger Roger`s extraordinary lyrics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen `Gold Diggers` with affection several times and laugh heartily at the skit on it in `Movie Movie`. which is brilliant.I never cease to be amazed at the opening number performed by Ginger Rogers. `We`re in the money` she warbles in a clear, thin voice and then she, in very close up, proceeds to sing gobbledegook or some words that are apparently meaningless. Nobody has ever remarked on this.I am doing so now and would like an explanation if there is any early talkie buff out there willing to supply it.The `girls on the make` theme is very daring for the period and makes us realise that in `them thar days` movies had real stories. All this and Busby Berkley too!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As part of my film course i watched this film and was left with a warm, fluffy feeling inside! My friends too were left humming the tune of 'petting in the park' (a personal favourite). The dance numbers are spectacular, the songs are unforgetable and the dialogue is witty. Despite Trixie's annoying voice all the characters add something to the film and you'd be a fool to not fall for Brad's smooth charms! When asked what my favourite musical was, the answer was always Mary Poppins, but move over Mary, Golddiggers is the way forward!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Splendid, one of the best film musicals of the 30s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gold Diggers of 1933 is a splendidly done film all-round, not just as a film musical but as a film overall too. Of the Busby Berkeley-choreographed films Gold Diggers of 1933 is one of the best, on par with the brilliant 42nd Street. It is beautifully produced, well shot throughout and with glitzy and true to period production values. You have to love the sexy gold-coin costumes in We're in the Money. The songs add a lot also to the film's success, Petting in the Park is a very sweet and endearing song, My Forgotten Man(one of the most powerful songs and musical routines on film) is downbeat but incredibly moving and We're the Money is wonderfully optimistic(fitting as it is in a way an anthem to it). The choreography continues to dazzle, the kaleidoscopic style of it also ground-breaking. Powerful too as in how it really reflected the times, that is one of the main reasons why My Forgotten Man has the impact that it has. Standing out in this respect are We're in the Money and the Shadow Waltz, the latter being one of the most visually striking scenes in Gold Diggers of 1933. There is some cracking dialogue, full of snappy wit, and the story while typically Broadway-ish is warm-hearted, never dull and remarkably relevant to the times. The characters are appealing, and the performances also. Ruby Keeler never was the great singer or dancer, much has been said about her stompy foot-work and her inability to sing in tune or even in the right key, but her natural charm and innocence are enough to win one over. Dick Powell is handsome in looks and voice, and characterises in a charming and good-natured way, a good partner for Keeler and they are very convincing together. Joan Blondell is very sassy in her general acting here, and still manages to be affecting in her final number, and Etta Moten is similarly likable. Gold Diggers of 1933 is also directed with total command and assured style by Mervyn Leroy who shows himself to be an ideal choice for directing the film. In conclusion, a splendid film and one of the best film musicals of the 30s. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let Me Dream A Song That I Can Bring To You</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classy film complete with classy guys, classy dames and classy tunes. This was the perfect bookend to 42nd St, the perfect let's put on a show film, so much so when young I used to get them completely mixed up and with interchangeable songs. I hadn't seen it in over 15 years but thanks to a very Good Samaritan I saw it again tonight and was suitably re-impressed and wondered how I could ever get confused. Why, 42nd St had marvellous songs while Gold Diggers Of 1933 had magnificent songs.Mysterious song composer, singer, actor Dick Powell mysteriously bankrolls a stage musical, with his girl Ruby Keeler starring. Turns out he has an old fashioned morally stern family headed by brother Warren William who doesn't approve of his lifestyle, leading to most of the dialogue in the script. In her choice of men the cheap and vulgar Joan Blondell must've needed those big eyes testing! The innocent love affair between Powell and Keeler is again enchanting to take in, along with Blondell's and Aline MacMahon's incessant coy pre-Code quips. Songs include We're In The Money, Torch Song, Petting In The Park, Forgotten Man, and the unforgettable Shadow Waltz imho the finest Warren &amp; Dubin collaboration. And Busby Berkeley excelled himself in the production of that one too, the number seems to get more amazing as the years pass when you remember the technical limitations they had to put up with in 1933 with such fine results.All in all one of the best musicals produced, with so many memorable bits, from pre-Code sassiness to gloriously romantic tunes. This is a film where getting a lodging for a night takes on a whole new meaning! Sadly it all got a little tamer after this and Footlight Parade, but what a ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE best musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen just about every musical out there (i collect 'em!), and this is my All-Time Favorite!!! Why? The storyline, cast, &amp; great musical numbers! The cast "clicks" in this film like they did in no other ("Dames", and all the rest). Imho, no other musical comes near it, even the oft-touted "42nd Street".I'm amazed/amused by the number of comments about the "pre-code" scenes (like this was something "terrible")..... all are EXTREMELY tame, compared to the garbage they have today (and which most people blindly accept). (Don't forget that burlesque was widely accepted at that time, as well...).Sure, the film is "dated"! It was made over 60 years ago! U can enjoy it without making THAT comment.........Btw....the cords on the violins is NOT a "goof"....the violins needed power to light up, didn't they? How else are you gonna do it back then?They were removed during the sequences when the dancers would've gotten tangled up in 'em. It was VERY well done! Just sit back and ENJOY IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Berkeley and the Depression make beautiful music together</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is supposed to be a pseudo-remake of 1929's "Gold Diggers of Broadway", except in the four year interim the Great Depression is in full swing and our gold diggers have hit on bad times like everyone else. The second Berkeley film in the Warner series of musicals starts off with Ginger Rogers singing "We're in the Money" in an outrageous number in which the chorus girls are all dressed in over-sized coins. As Ginger sings part of the number in pig-Latin, the whole thing seems surreal, and in a way it is. The sheriff breaks in on the number to repossess everything on the set to settle the debts of the show's producer, and the gold diggers are out of work again. I don't know why I keep calling them gold diggers, because this cadre of chorines are just looking for steady work. They have abandoned all hope of getting millionaire husbands to take them away from all of this.Brad Roberts (Dick Powell) comes to their rescue when he comes up with both the money and the songs for a new show that broke but creative producer Barney Hopkins (Ned Sparks) has in mind. Thinking that Brad is penniless like the rest of them, the girls at first think Brad is playing a tasteless joke before he produces the 15K, and that he is a bank robber on the run afterwards. This is reinforced by his refusal to make any personal appearance in the show. In fact Brad is a young man from a wealthy New England family who is hiding his work in the theatre from his snobbish old-money relatives who soon surface to reclaim him in the person of his brother, Lawrence (Warren William), and the family lawyer (Guy Kibbee). When they find out Brad is planning to marry one of the girls (Ruby Keeler), Brad's brother decides to find the girl, flash his cash, and thus romance her himself, since he presumes she is a gold digger. He figures this will prove to Brad just what kind of girl he has fallen for. Unfortunately, Brad's brother doesn't know what she looks like. And that's where the fun starts.There's some great pre-code comedy here particularly from Joan Blondell, not to mention her stirring performance of "Forgotten Man" about World War I soldiers who are now marching in Depression Era bread lines. Also not to be missed is "Shadow Waltz" with the chorus girls playing fake fluorescent violins that would occasionally short out and shock the girls.Guy Kibbee and Aline McMahon are both terrifically funny and touching in one of the film's subplots as two people who find genuine love later in life than they may have wanted and originally planned. They are basically reprising the roles played by Albert Gran and Winnie Lightner in Gold Diggers of Broadway. However, Aline MacMahon has a subtle even homespun brand of humor versus Lightner's brash style.As in The Gold Diggers of Broadway, the film ends with the show itself, but these are two entirely different shows for two entirely different eras. The 1929 film ends with chorus girls parading around in elaborate costumes and decorated by two-strip Technicolor while acrobats and tap dancers strut their exhilarated stuff. The 1933 film ends with a number about forgotten men marching both off to war and back to bread lines in spartan black and white. A powerful ending for a great piece of entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #085: Gold Diggers of 1933</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>085: Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933) - released 5/27/1933, viewed 2/6/07.Hitler and the Nazis ban trade unions, establish the Gestapo, and stage massive book burnings. Ghandi begins a 3-week hunger strike. Roosevelt puts his New Deal into motion with the Tennessee Valley Authority and the Federal Securities Act.BIRTHS: Elizabeth Montgomery, Jayne Mansfield, Carol Burnett, James Brown, Louis Farrakhan, Joan Collins. DEATHS: Henry Royce.DOUG: We come to the second part of the trilogy of backstage musicals that delivered Warner Brothers from bankruptcy during the depression, preceded by '42nd Street' and followed by 'Footlight Parade.' The result is possibly better than '42nd Street,' certainly easier to follow, and much funnier. I'm still a little hazy as to how a film made during the Depression that shows characters dealing with the Depression by putting on a show about the Depression qualifies as an escape. I guess it felt good to see these characters making it through the hardships. Most of the gang is back: Ruby Keeler, Dick Powell, Guy Kibbee, Ned Sparks, Ginger Rogers, and choreographer Busby Berkely. They are joined by Warren William, Joan Blondell, the fantastic Arline MacMahon, and director Mervyn LeRoy. The cast seems even more tightly knit this time around. Trixie (Arline) is the most charming and charismatic; she'd have been right at home on a Lubitsh movie. She also seems to be the only one willing to appear on screen without full make-up. Ginger Rogers manages to be much more memorable this time around (singing "We're in the Money" in pig-Latin will do that). There's a mention of "The Astaires," referring to Fred and his sister Adele, and an eerie foreshadowing of Fred's pending partnership with Ginger Rogers that would begin later that year. This time the dance numbers are more spread out. One at the end, "Remember my Forgotten Man," is a rather graphic and moving tribute to the unemployed WWI vets. The first half is all about trying to get the money to put on the show, while the second half essentially follows the ladies living up to the title by seducing the rich men that have come their way. I thought it was weird how Lawrence (William) accepts Carol (Blondell) so easily at the end: "Yes dear, even though you deceived me, lied to me, cheated me out of tons of money, and strung me along like an idiot, I still love you." I also felt the relationship between William and Powell doesn't seem brotherly at all, more like father-son. After all, how can Lawrence control the fortune that his younger brother Brad is set to inherit? Did the censors demanded that this be altered, since it's much less naughty for a man to steal a woman away from his brother than to steal a woman from his son? (I could be wrong...).KEVIN: We continue our double-feature with a dramatic change of mood. Warner Bros. follow-up to '42nd Street' sees a return of stage maestro Busby Berkeley and much of the cast of that previous film. It's 'Gold Diggers of 1933,' and I must say, I really got a kick out of this one. It takes a few cues from '42nd Street,' such as everyone clamoring for a job in a show during the Depression. But despite the welcome return of so many familiar faces and talents, this is hardly a retread. It seems to have an unusual two-act structure, from my view at least. The first act focuses on the struggles of getting the show made. There we introduce the tight-knit pack of showgirls, played by familiar faces Ruby Keeler and Ginger Rogers, along with Joan Blondell and Arline MacMahon. And let's not forget the always wonderful Guy Kibbee, Dick Powell, and the fantastic Ned Sparks, still chomping away on that damn cigar. I got worried when Sparks disappeared in the second act, but thankfully he puts in a final appearance towards the end. He's the producer trying to put together a hit musical that addresses the depression. As we see more musical numbers from the show, I began to wonder where the depression would come in (fortunately, the rainy breadline turns up near the end of the film). There's a funny yet irritating scene at the beginning where the girls drag themselves out of bed in full makeup. The second act comes after the success of the play, as the girls kick on the feminine wiles to stop Powell's brother (Warren William) from breaking him up with Ruby. My biggest beef with the second half is that it's too straightforward and predictable. Although we are rooting for the rich snobs to get their comeuppance, I was expecting a few more twists and complications than are actually delivered. But I enjoyed it immensely, especially the witty banter and Mervyn LeRoy's skillful direction. There's still a lot more from him we can look forward to.Last film: The Testament of Dr. Mabuse (1933). Next film: Baby Face (1933).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot which seems to have spawned a hundred sequels, it's just that good. Sure, Ruby Keeler dancing seems dated, if not downright clumsy at times, and her singing somewhat forgettable. In her later years, she was quite candid in admitting surprise at her own success and her acting, singing and dancing limitations. Williams and Kibbee are top notch as a pair of priggish brothers. Berkley is, well, Berkley, but Berkley at his novel best in this film. Those who remember Dick Powell as a dramatic actor will be delightfully surprised at his comedic and musical abilities. But if for nothing else, this is worth watching for the chance to watch two of the most talented and beautiful women to ever make movies - Joan Blondell and Ginger Rogers. Both had long and deservedly successful careers and this movie is a good example of why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To finally watch this film on DVD was great. Mervyn LeRoy and of course the one and only Busby Berkeley put out one of the best musical of any era. Gold diggers of 1933 is a real nice time capsule of a time when America was facing it's lowest economical status. The musical numbers are simply amazing and like lots of reviewers already wrote, the "Remember my forgotten man" number is a significant moment in the history of 30's American cinema.It is also a joy to watch Joan Blondell, Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell at the top of their game. Keeler, although not one of the most talented actress, seems so sincere and passionate in her role that we cannot help but love her. No offense to all Ruby fans out there.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful dance routines, amusing plot, social-message coda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange and wonderful movie, at once celebrating Broadway and waxing ironic. The movie opens with Ginger Rogers singing "We're in the Money" with giant coins everywhere and lyrics about the Depression being finished and a great, glitzy dance routine?and it gets closed down by a sheriff for bad debts. There's a romance between the boy songwriter (Dick Powell) and Polly, the sweetest of the girls (Ruby Keeler), almost jinxed when it turns out he's from a Boston blueblood family and the big brother comes down to nip this theatre thing in the bud. He's awful and contemptuous and two of the girls in the common apartment decide to fool him. Carole (Joan Blondell) and the comic Trixie (Aline McMahon) pretend Carole is Polly and she comes on to the brother while Trixie flirts with the goggled banker. In this picture the women have all the power over the men, except that Carol falls in love with the brother. But things are resolved and there's a happy ending for the romantic plot. The producer J. Lawrence Bradford (Warren William) has a gift for looking surprised by nearly anything. The dance routines, by Busby Berkeley, are magnificent. Some are clearly just stage routines on film, but then the stage gets really big, too big to fit inside a regular theatre, and hundreds of dancers move up and down massively curved staircases or other sets, and then some routines are designed for film, especially to be seen from above. In one amazing shot, the large, round edges of the helical dresses the dancers wear become petals of a flower opening and closing. The music's okay?one small piece is very good, when an African American singer, Etta Moten, does a couple of bluesy verses of one of the main songs. All the songs and dance and dialogue have to do with money and even more with love. And then the very last bit is about the "Forgotten Man," who is not only unemployed but a veteran as well. A cop is rousting a bum and Carol turns back the collar of his coat to show a Bronze Star medal. An odd piece of social message tacked onto the screenplay?but it is also presented with an incredibly lavish Berkeleian production number.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The voluptuous expression of a loving heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is remarkable stuff about the effort to produce art that matters and can seduce love from us.It is exhilarating to watch on just a basic level, with all the frill and gaudiness that characterizes the Hollywood musical, but doubly endearing because we get to reconcile the eye-popping excess with layered inside the mechanisms that shape this vision from one stage to the next. It is a film about the makings of the film that we are watching.It starts with the rehearsal of a Broadway musical, an early run of this film we're meant to be watching; a lavish set-piece celebrating money, happiness, the end of breadlines, all this audaciously enough in the middle of the Depression - writing this from a country devastated by recess I can, on a very small degree at least, put myself in the shoes an audience greeted with this first scene. No sooner is the rehearsal over however, than police break it up and start requisitioning everything, props, equipment, even the skimpy dresses on the dancers. It's a fascinating scene, with literally the entire hubris of this show that we were watching being dismantled back into harsh reality. Clearly this seduction would not do just yet.A new show is soon commissioned, this time one meant to poignantly address the times. The rest of the film is about the effort of both participants and viewers to learn to embody what this new film is about - exposing to the audience that only love can steer the soul through hard times - so that the vision is truthful when it reaches the stage; naturally it starts with deceit and seduction on both sides, the actresses from that play and old money men from Boston pretending affections for one another while pursuing selfish agendas.Of course gradually cynical soul hardened for money is seduced by the innocence of true feeling; in both romantic cases the reversal does not convince, but has the power to seduce us on the other end with just the grand sweep of the events. Love conquers, because we want it to.So eventually the new play is staged and it's an uproar, again pure gaudiness with soldiers marching up and down. Its purpose is meant to channel outrage into a sort of patriotic committal for the long run, a selfless love that endures.Don't be put off that it's a musical, if you are; song and dance is only the voluptuous expression of a loving heart. Below these we have a film about the heart learning to beat truthfully, the purgings that take place inside and produce art with the capacity to move on the other side. It's just dreamy enough for it to work, purely Hollywood.And it's one of the most enjoyable films I've seen in a while. Joan Blondell has a fierce pout that clears all shadows.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember My Forgotten Man, You put a Rifle in His Hand!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched Gold Diggers of 1933 last night and was left in awe. First it's beautifully restored, thanks to Turner Classics. I was struck by the sexual innuendos, and was amazed that Hollywood was so open about sex back then. Of course we know that the 'Code' came along and such openness in films was forbidden for years. The number 'Pettin in the Park' had tons of nude female silhouettes, and lustful guys and in the restaurant scene Fanny (Guy Kibbee) tries to stick his hand up (Aline MacMahon) Trixie's skirt! It was a feel good film as the three starving (It's the Depression) female leads all ended up marrying men with money and hopefully live happily ever after.However, the one number that will stick with me for years to come is the politically charged closing number, "Forgotten Man". Such a blunt number today about the political and social climate would raise eyebrows. So you can imagine what it must have done back then. Joan Blondell does a wonderful job opening the piece, but then African American singer, Etta Moten jumps in and powerfully sings the song thus stealing the number from Blondell. Sadly due to the times (racism in America and Hollywood) Moten gets almost no credit.Moten is sitting in a window lamenting through song and the camera pans to other women. The emotion on all the actresses faces is powerful. The song, though dated is a great statement about the effects that war has on the women left behind and what happens when the men return.Overall it's a very entertaining musical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>At lot of fun...even if you are not a big fan of musicals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, did this film have a stellar cast. Imagine a musical where Ginger Rogers is billed about 8th! Sure, it's early in her career, but she is just one of many shining Warner Brothers musical stars. While the film stars Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell, on hand are also Joan Blondell, Warren William, Guy Kibbee and Aline MacMahon. This is quite a cast as they not only featured some wonderful singers and dancers, but the non-musical cast members made the rest of the film memorable--even if you aren't a fan of musicals.The film begins with a Broadway show being closed before it can even open. It seems that the Depression is hitting shows in a big way and they're closing right and left. As a result, lots of nice people are out of work and there's no end in sight until, out of the blue, Dick Powell comes to the rescue. At first, everyone is skeptical. After all, he wrote the songs for the show and lives in a normal New York flat-- how could he raise the money so quickly? Well, it seems he comes from a family that is loaded and once the family finds out he's involved with "show people", they panic. It's even worse when they hear that he's actually engaged to one of "them"! So, to save the family honor, it's up to his stodgy old brother (Warren William) to break up any chance at wedding bells. However, in a cute twist, he thinks that Powell's girl is Blondell--while it actually is Ruby Keeler. Blondell decides to play along to teach William a lesson and by the end of the picture, everything seems to (naturally) work itself out for everyone.The film has some decent song and dance numbers choreographed by director Busby Berkeley and they are pretty typical of his style. There are a few notable things, such as the cool neon violins in one song and the very, very sexually suggestive "Petting in the Park" song. But, the inclusion of this song as well as a lot of cheesecake shots AND William thinking he'd slept with Blondell is all in keeping with the Pre-Code sensibilities of 1933.One odd thing about the film is that it is one of the few films of the era that actually acknowledges the Depression. Not only does this cause problems with their finding jobs, but several of the dance numbers are also about this upheaval--including an odd tribute to the out of work WWI vets that comes at the end of the film. This routine came just months after the famed "Bonus Army" of out of work vets descended on Washington to demand early payment of financial bonuses to ex-servicemen.Overall, a very fascinating historical curio and a decent story above and beyond all the Busby Berkeley hubbub. While my score of 9 might seem excessive, compared to other similar musicals of the era (such as 42ND STREET and FOOTLIGHT PARADE), this one stacks up very well. Just remember musicals of the early 30s were nothing like later ones, as they usually were like a Broadway stage production combined with a film. The usual "singing while working or at play" style of musicals would come a decade later.A final note to viewers in the UK. Try to control yourself when Aline MacMahon says that she "loves Fanny". Even though this is, at times, a sexually suggestive movie, you know that is comment is NOT exactly what it sounds like, as this slang term is NOT one they use in the States. Most likely no gutter language was intended! Fanny is the name of Guy Kibbee's character and that's all! To you non-Brits, ask a British friend if you don't know what I am talking about here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take an oooolllllddddd plot (let's put on a musical!), add young vibrant stars, a snappy script, incredible production numbers and you have one of the best 1930s musicals out there. Ginger Rogers and Joan Blondell are excellent, Ruby Keeler is OK, Powell is annoying (he grins too much and his acting is WAY over the top). Still the songs are great, the opening number (We're in the Money) is wonderful, especially that verse in Pig Latin! It's very dated (the "Forgotten Man" number is talking about World War 1 veterans!) and totally unbelievable but tons of fun. If it's on TV, tune in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate pre-code experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933) is incredibly hard to categorize. All at once, it's a musical extravaganza, romantic comedy, satire, and biting social commentary of the Great Depression. Few films are so thoroughly of their time and place, to the point where they can give us something of a glimpse into the mindset of the period in which they were created. The cast reads like a who's who of early 1930s Hollywood: Joan Blondell, Ginger Rogers, Warren William, Ruby Keeler, and Dick Powell to name a few. Each actor is dazzling.It's also a microcosm of pre-code subversiveness. The values of the moral guardians of the day are thoroughly mocked on almost every topic, from sex to class. With the exception of Baby Face (1933), few other pre-codes were as gleefully devious. A must watch for everyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I'm in the right mood I think of THE GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 as the best musical ever made. Mostly I find its tonal shifts a bit incoherent for that high honor, but GOLD DIGGERS is at least a strong contender.For my money, a great musical ought to have a great original musical score (sorry SINGING IN THE RAIN) and beyond that ought to be of real interest even in the absence of its music. I don't mean that we're looking for Hamlet or King Lear, such complexity would probably make successful musical integration quite impossible, but a clever treatment of a solid subject will do. GOLD DIGGERS presents us with a sharp comedy of errors bookended by a pair of serious production numbers. Probably a unique structure, and not entirely successful in my view, but the parts of this structure rarely descend below the marvelous.Maybe only 'We're In The Money' (really titled 'The Gold Digger's Song') can stand alone from the film's score, but Warren and Dubin's other efforts all work perfectly within Berkeley's inspired production numbers. Those numbers are a slight advance on 42nd STREET's, more consistently elaborate and spread out within the picture, which was probably a good idea. The opening number, springing immediately from the opening credits, seems as merry and frivolous as they come until its conclusion is cut off by a sheriff's repossession, giving us a textbook example for the word 'ironic'. There remain serious undertones through the nice expository scenes in the girls' apartment which follow, but the movie soon shifts to pure comedy, and the musical numbers along with it (especially the deliriously surreal 'Pettin' in the Park'). Once the comical confusions have been cleared up the ultimate 'Forgotten Man' number comes nearly out of nowhere (Ned Sparks had given us slight anticipation for it much earlier on). Its relevance to recent events in 1933 is clear (WW I vets had been promised bonuses for their old age. Given the economic circumstances, they had demanded the bonuses immediately and marched on Washington in protest, camping out there for quite some time. Eventually the government ordered the military, under Douglas MacArthur as it happened, to clear them out, and this was done violently. It shook a lot of people up, referenced here by Joan Blondell's memorable glare towards the cop telling the homeless veteran to move on), but it doesn't seem to have much to do with the movie we've just seen so far as I could tell.The Forgotten Man number is brilliant, however, and so had been the movie that we had just watched. Aline MacMahon and Guy Kibbee are particularly funny, Warren William does well in the thankless role of the straight man to everybody's jokes, Ginger Rogers gives further proof of versatility as she projects pure vanity perfectly. It's unfortunate that she nearly disappears from the movie early on (and for that matter, Keeler practically disappears from it once the Willam-Kibbee/Blondell- MacMahon plot takes center stage). She actually filmed a very bluesy/sad version of 'I've Got To Sing A Torch Song' which must have been meant for sometime around the scene when Trixie threw Fay out of that nightclub for coming on to 'Fanny'. The film seems to have disappeared though for those interested the sound track can be heard on Youtube. It would have given a twist to the character of Fay, a one-noter as she now exists.THE GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 may not be the best of all possible musicals, but if someone were to ask me for the most representative film from Hollywood in the 1930s, GOLD DIGGERS would be the one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Show Must Go On, Even In The Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Gold Diggers of 1933) opens with Ginger Rogers singing as part of a bevy of chorus girls. Then it switches to an apartment shared by three others in that show, bemoaning how tough it is to get a job. It's the depression, and it colors every aspect of the story. (Another film about the backstage lives of actresses will follow in 1937--"Stage Door", also starring Ginger Rogers, is a better film, but both are worth watching.)The three women are played by Ruby Keeler, Joan Blondell, and Aline MacMahon. Just when they are at their lowest, there is hope of a new revue--if only they can find financing. The funding finally comes from a surprising source, and the film launches into a number of parallel love stories that develop as the show gets off the ground.The rest of the cast is talented, including Dick Powell, who is well suited for the revue format. A large portion of the film is consumed by Busby Berkley extravaganza pieces that deserve to be seen for their own historical significance. The final number is driven by a beautiful piece of music, "My Forgotten Man", a lament for the victims of the economy, especially those who served as doughboys in WWI. It's a jazz march with gospel overtones--a very powerful piece of music, accompanied by scenes of soup lines filled with former heroes."Gold Diggers" is also notable for its pre-Code titillations, like the obligatory stocking shots and the racy implications of nudity, in silhouette.</fullReview>

Some I really like, like "Seven Brides for Seven Brothers". Many more I could probably do without. This one is alright, though it could never be my favorite. The most notable song is "Petting in the Park", which seems rather risqué for the 1930s (but maybe I'm wrong).The only thing really making this film redeeming today is Ginger Rogers. Most of the other actors involved, including Dick Powell, have been largely forgotten. How this film continues to resonate with today's audiences, I have no idea.

		<shortDescription>Unusual and excellent Busby-choreographed musical, with 2 musicals relating to The Depression</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprise!. In contrast to the other musicals in this series of Berkeley-choreographed musicals, this one begins right off featuring Ginger Roger's face filling the screen, singing "We're in the Money". Along with chorus girls, she is decked out in with many silver dollars, and with much oversized replicas of coins decorating their skimpy outfits. or in the background to further emphasize the plentifulness of large coins. The dancers do a few signature Berkeley-styled undulating routines, including a troop standing behind Ginger, invisible, moving their arms up and down, making Ginger look like the Hindu goddess Durga. Ginger's last singing bout sounds like so much gibberish, because it's 'pig Latin', presumably to add a comedic touch....There are 3 more dance productions; one more than the typical Berkeley musical of this series, with "Petting in the Park" around the middle, and the film ending with the other two: an unusual dispersal pattern for a Berkeley film of this series. I think more musicals, through the years, should have copied this format of starting right off with a splashy number. A few did. I can think of "Oklahoma" and "the Sound of Music", with wondrously memorable songs and great singers. The only Astaire &amp; Ginger film, contemporaneous with the present film, that did so was "Follow the Fleet", and is no doubt one reason why I consider that one of my favorites of their films. Unlike the other musicals in this series or any of the Astaire &amp; Ginger films, two of the production numbers relate directly to the poverty of The Depression. The last one, featuring bread lines, distraught wives, and soldiers marching in the rain, and a similarly themed song, dramatizes the misery for many Americans., Actually, this production was originally slated to occur in the middle of the film, so why references to the song("Remember My Forgotten Man"), and plot features are heard there. Berkeley had served in WWI, thus was sympathetic with the 'Bonus Army' of WWI veterans, who were met with physical hostility when they marched on Washington, requesting that their promised 'bonuses', not due until 1945, be paid immediately. This was the main reason for the prominence of army marchers in this production, although mass formations were a stock feature of Berkeley musical productions. Joan Blondell does a fine job in her talking and singing roles in this production, which ends the film."We're in the Money", both the song and the production, also obviously relates to The Depression audiences and to the plot. The lyrics, as well as visuals, try to deny the reality of widespread poverty, and provide hope that this state will soon be replaced by prosperity under the New Deal policies of the incoming FDR administration.(of which Berkeley was a supporter). It also provides ironic contrast to the interruption of this production by police, who have come to push everyone out, because the producer can't pay the rent or other bills. It also relates to the ambition of some of the impoverished chorus girls(played by Joan Blondell and Aline MacNahon) to trick some wealthy unmarried middle-aged men(played by Warren William and Guy Kibbee), who despise gold-digging young women, into buying them expensive gifts, and eventually marrying them. This is the most interesting part of the screenplay for me. Ruby Keeler, another chorus girl, is romanced by songwriter and singer Brad(Dick Powell), who is secretly a wealthy heir, related to the characters played by William and Kibbee. Very surprising to the others, Brad volunteers to supply the money to put on the show. Hence, he is suspected of being a publicized bank robber, for a while.The "Petting in the Park" number was criticized by censors as being lewd, but somehow was retained. It includes the silhouettes of many chorus girls removing their wet clothes, to put on metallic clothes, presumably functioning as chastity belts, until a can opener is produced by a mischievous toddler(midget).The later "Shadow Waltz" number features many chorus girls in hooped skirts supposedly playing neon-lit violins, in various formations, including a violin with bow string, as seen from above: quite a striking and unusual production. In "Gold Diggers of 1935", the violins would be replaced by white pianos.As with the previous "42nd Street", all songs were composed by the Warren-Dubin team. Of these, only "We're in the Money" strikes me as being memorable as a stand alone song.The Dick Powell-Ruby Keeler ingénue romance, tenuously featured in 42nd Street, and again in "Footlight Parade", is placed on more firm footing in this film, and in the later "Dames", usually serving as the vehicle for performing romantic songs not used in the big productions, as well as in some of the big productions. Unlike most of the Astaire &amp; Ginger musicals, there were seldom big ups and downs in their romance, which sometimes was already established before the film began.I would guess Warren William will remind you of John Barrymore. Certainly true for me! Forgotten today, he was then at the peak of his popularity, followed by a rapid decline, having also been a star in the silent film era. His supposed romance with Joan Blondell looks awfully forced!, more so than the supposed Kibbee-MacMahon gold digger romance.</fullReview>

Because rather than the stereotypical sing and dance situation that actors do when their characters are feeling a strong emotion, they actually worked it into the narrative to give the musical numbers a purpose. The film while at times being gender orientated through weak women and strong upper class men; the film did show both genders switching roles, having independent women and manipulated men which is probably why the ending was so gender balanced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the lead girls doing the gold digging says she is not "cheap and vulgar" after accepting a check for $10,000 but not cashing it. The man who wrote the check is holding her in his arms and says he'll kiss her every time she says "cheap and vulgar", so she says it over and over and he kisses her each time. That expression is so dated, I thought it was pretty funny. Is English especially rich in expressions for "bad" girls? What is a bad girl? One who enjoys sex? If a woman accepts gifts from a man then dumps him, I think, in modern times, the man is considered to be a fool, the woman is not bad. Anyway, I though the use of this phrase was great, a glimpse into morals and attitudes of the past. Right now, I'm going to go out and look for some "cheap and vulgar" women. They sound like fun! Oh, the rest of the movie? It was great too. I agreed with everybody else who liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of 8 Berkeleys I watched this month</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many of the movies involving Busby Berkeley, the impact made on viewers by GOLD DIGGERS OF 1933 likely will be counter-intuitive. Other than being promised several times earlier in the story, Berkeley's closing ballad of The Forgotten Man has merely a tenuous relationship to the previous 95 percent of this film. Yet it catches the essence not only of its fictional world, but also the flavor of the atrocities waged against ordinary Americans by the Hoover Administration in the early 1930s, as well as the Corporate-purchased U.S. Administrations and Congresses of the 21st Century, which have allowed a concentration of wealth that now exceeds that prompting Theodore Roosevelt to bust the trusts of the Robber Barons even before Teddy's cousin Franklin socialized much of the American economy. Perhaps Berkeley's chief accomplishment was to get his truth into a format entertaining enough to win over not only the public well off enough to be able to spare a dime for the movies, but also the suits at Warner Brothers (though they admittedly WERE notoriously cheap, and consequently always on the look-out for anything sensational). Michael Moore's tirades of today cannot hold a candle to the subtly subversive power of this GOLD DIGGERS, which features sexy girls socking it to the rich guys before standing up and shouting out for their own "forgotten men."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in my history o film class as a film that was released before the crackdown of the Production Code. It is definite classic by far and it is one of the best movies that I have seen in a while. It shows the life that exists behind the theater industry and the stereotypes that women had to and are still dealing with. I just love that it wasn't so much of a love story but of its a story of women banning together and sticking up for each other and the camaraderie in exists in the entertainment industry because it's thought that they all back-stab each other. I highly recommend tracking this movie down and keeping it in your collection because you wont ever get tired of it, especially the opening scene and the "Petting in the Park" and the other performance pieces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gold Diggers of 1933 (1933)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Millionaire turned songwriter (Dick Powell) gives $15,000 to get a Broadway play off the ground but by doing so he embarrasses his rich family who don't want him marrying a showgirl (Ruby Keeler). His older brother (Warren William) shows up to force the woman to break up with him but he ends up speaking with the wrong woman (Joan Blondell) and soon finds himself falling in love. The actual story here isn't the strongest and it's certainly not the high point of this film but the terrific cast and excellent Busby Berkeley music scenes make this a true classic in its genre. After the cast introductions we get kicked into high gear with The Gold Diggers' Son (We're in the Money) sung magnificently by the beautiful Ginger Rogers. From here we get plenty of other great tunes including Powell singing Shadow Waltz, I've Got to Sing a Torch Song and Pettin' in the Park among others. For me the highlight of all the music was the first tune by Rogers as her talent, beauty and charm jump right off the screen the minute she opens her mouth and it's not hard to see why America fell in love with her. It seems Powell gets a few major critics today but he too was very charming in his role and he played the part extremely well. Keeler didn't seem to have the greatest talent in the world but she makes her character very believable here and her scenes with Powell are another major plus. I've yet to see a woman that William wasn't good in and his dark, grumpy character is a lot of fun as is his relationship with Blondell. Aline MacMahon and Guy Kibbee add great support as well. The music sequences are all extremely beauty to watch unfold and especially a later "glowing in the dark" sequence, which will certainly catch anyone's attention even if they hate musicals. I think the film is far from perfect with most of the blame being on the lack of songs in the middle of the picture and the fact that the "joke" being pulled on William isn't the strongest bit of writing out there. With that said, the cast and music is so great that this here certainly deserves its reputation of a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>High Standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Busby Berkeley's musical pieces in this film set high standards and expectations for future musical films. His work was excellent, and his additional films continued to raise the bar for visual effects, precision dancing and movement, and creativity in costumes, sets, lighting, and camera work. The story is a bit hokey, as most were in the early 1930's, but the performances by Dick Powell and Joan Blondell were outstanding. I have never understood the movie audiences' infatuation with Ruby Keeler. In my opinion, she was far from star quality. Her voice was grating; her acting was amateurish; her dancing was mediocre; and she wasn't nearly as beautiful or striking in looks as many of her contemporaries. Perhaps it's just my perspective from many decades later, but I just do not enjoy her in any movie in which I've seen her. She reminds me of the silent screen actress who couldn't sing, speak, or act well in "talking pictures," as beautifully lampooned in "Singin' in the Rain." Ginger Rogers, who had a much smaller part in the film, so upstaged her that it is obvious to me who the better actress and singer really was, and certainly I know Rogers could out-dance Keeler easily.There was at least one actor whom I seemed to recognize in a quick scene, even though he had no speaking part. I had to review the cast list to discover William "Wild Bill" Elliott, an actor I enjoyed very much in western films produced much later. I also was interested in the short scene with Sterling Holloway, who later was much more famous as a comedian. I had no idea Billy Barty was in movies this early. Until I read the cast list, I didn't even realize Dennis O'Keefe had a bit part in the film. Finally, I was most impressed by the singing of Etta Moten; what a fabulous voice she had.This is an interesting movie. I am a sucker for Berkeley's films, and I will enjoy seeing this one again.</fullReview>

My only disappointment was that the credits were not shown when I saw it on the Turner Classic Music Channel.I was looking for the name of the African American woman who sang. With African American roles being so few in that era, it really meant a lot to me to know who she was. If anyone knows her name, I would really appreciate that information.Most classic movies take the time to add clever lines and subtle remarks to spice up the dialog. These spicy tidbits are a refreshing replacement for the profanity that is so prevalent in movies today. And I'll take the musical numbers over the explosions and other exaggerated special effects - and the elaborate wardrobe over the absence of wardrobe that's so common in more recent film productions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Gold Diggers of 1933" is lighter and funnier than "42nd Street," released earlier in the same year and the product of much of the same production team. Though at the same time, the Depression is more constantly present in "Gold Diggers" than it was in "42nd Street," and the film culminates (and ends rather abruptly) with a dark and critical social comment.Present again are the elaborate and bizarre choreographic creations of Busby Berkeley, designed to showcase lots of female skin. Particularly nonsensical is the "Pettin' in the Park" number that ends (I'm not kidding) with Dick Powell using a can opener on Ruby Keeler. And get a load of those costumes in the "We're in the Money" number; those strategically placed quarters would never have gotten past the censors had this been released post-code. Overall, it's obvious that the filmmakers were still more used to vaudeville than musical comedy, as the film pretty much stops to allow time for some disjointed musical numbers rather than incorporating them into the action.The aforementioned Powell and Keeler are about as bland as they were in "42nd Street," though Keeler is much more palatable without the saccharine, cavity-inducing personality she was asked to don in the earlier movie. And thank God she isn't given more than a few minutes to dance, since she's got the grace of a truck driver.The biggest assets to this film are Joan Blondell, spicy and sexy, and Aline MacMahon, who plays the role Rosalind Russell would be playing if she were in this movie. Ginger Rogers, tremendous screen presence aside, has only a couple of scenes and is pretty much wasted again, though she inexplicably gets to sing some bars of "We're in the Money" in Pig Latin and extreme close-up.A film center in my home city of Chicago is having a Busby Berkeley retrospective, so I've been able to see these two early thirties movies in sequence and note how the art form of musical comedy evolved from one film to the next. "42nd Street" was like musical comedy without the music or the comedy. "Gold Diggers of 1933" adds the comedy, but still struggles with what to do with the music. "Gold Diggers of 1935" is up next, and we'll see what Berkeley and company have learned along the way.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-code Hollywood at its best!!! Gets my EIGHT.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read some of the earlier user comments on this movie, I heard the term "pre-code" for the first time. Not being that literate in the Hollywood of the 20's and 30's I had to dig a little, using the internet, but I came up with the answer. If you are interested, read on.The "code" was the attempt by Hollywood to perform an in-house policy of self-censorship. The code was known as the Hays Code and was administered by the Production Code Administration. The MPPDA pledged to abide by the code, beginning in March of 1930, but it was not until July of 1934 that the MPPDA empowered the Production Code Administration to enforce it. The four years in between became called the pre-Code era, when censorship was lax, and Hollywood made the most of it. The "code" was what producer Samuel Goldwyn might have said, wasn't worth the paper it was written on. So, pre-Code Hollywood laid bare what Hollywood under the Code did its best to cover up and push off screen. Sexual liaisons unsanctified by the laws of God or man in Unashamed (1932), Blonde Venus (1932), and She Done Him Wrong (1933); marriage ridiculed and redefined in Madame Satan (1930), The Common Law (1931), and Old Morals for New (1932); ethnic lines crossed and racial barriers ignored in The Bitter Tea of General Yen (1933), The Emperor Jones (1933), and Massacre (1934); economic injustice exposed and political corruption assumed in Wild Boys of the Road (1933), This Day and Age (1933), and Gabriel Over the White House (1933); vice unpunished and virtue unrewarded in Red Headed Woman (1932), Call Her Savage (1932), and Baby Face (1933) in sum, pretty much the raw stuff of American culture, unvarnished and unveiled.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can open up that chick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I don't think this Gold Diggers is as good as the 1935 version or as good as Footlight Parade or Dames, it is still classic Busby Berkley and therefore absolutely amazing. While the plot is what it is, the musical sequences at the end are not to be believed. My favorite part of this film is when the girls get all wet in the rainstorm and then have to go back and change and you see them all naked in silloutte behind this curtain and then this freaky little boy/dwarf guy pulls up the shade but the girls are all now dressed in metal corsets and at first Dick Powell can't figure out what to do but then the freaky little boy/dwarf gives him a can opener and Powell proceeds to liberate Ruby Keeler from her mettalic shell. The freaky little boy/dwarf reappears in Footlight Parade as Ruby Keeler's little brother in the Honeymoon Hotel sequence and there is this really great part in that movie where Dick Powell crawls in to bed thinking that Ruby's in there and then freaks out when he finds the little freak instead. Powell is so startled that he then jumps out of bed and throws an ashtray at the little freak like he was trying to kill a rat or something. It's great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Fanfare of Strumpets. Disgusting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's difficult to choose the most revolting scene in this story of showgirls fleecing decent men in order to put on a "show," but if one were forced to pick, probably the most qualified scene involves a depraved midget playing a six-month-old infant peeking up a girl's skirt. In the course of this musical number, in which salivating young men, their eyes alight with lust, pursue coy but equally libidinous pretty young girls, the girls strip off their wet "things" (ie., clothing) in silhouette and emerge encased each in her individual tin girdle. The "boys" are uniformly disappointed by this gesture towards what any ordinary viewer must construe as a decent chastity. But then the "infant" appears and hands out can openers. I have a simple question to ask. What does that do to your image of infants? When they are not bound up in tin or showing off their limbs, these showgirls run around with their body parts half tumbling out of loose casual dresses and so-called teddies.There are also allusions to -- well, to inversions. A plump man delivering a hat speaks with a lisp. And the juvenile lead in a musical develops a severe case of lumbago and can't straighten up. The producer shouts at him, "You can't sing a love song all bent over like that! What kind of love song do you think this IS?" Some of the more vulgar among you might find that amusing.The filthy film endorses not only inversion and lust but outright crime. There is a joyful scene set in a "speakeasy," an establishment in which spiritous liquors are sold illegally. Why not bring in the maryjane "reefers" too? Then we come to what I'm pleased to call the sociological aspects of this stomach-turning tract of socialist propaganda. All people of means, except for one who is a traitor to his class, are treated as unfeeling dolts. Yes, it's true. And they have names like Bradford, Treat, Peabody, and Fenueil. I can only imagine how the cultivated and morally upright people of Back Bay Boston must have felt, seeing themselves so skewered.And the so-called showgirls. Whining and complaining that they have no money -- as if it weren't their own fault. It happens to be a scientifically established fact, of which these connivers are conveniently ignorant, that people are poor because they are averse to work. And they are averse to work because they are lazy. Isn't it enough that by 1933 one third of America's labor force became too lazy to bother going to work? Do they deserve our SYMPATHY as well? I don't mean to suggest that there is no talent on display. On the contrary, the stunning grace and delicacy of Ruby Keeler's tap dancing, evoking images of gliding swans, of leaping gazelles, of swooping fairies, of more than usually adroit armadillos, deserves all the more praise in view of her psychomotor deficit. She suffers further from the disadvantage of being an alien immigrant (Canadian) and should be applauded for having shed the typical foreigner's baggage of politesse and punctilio that she must have brought with her across the border.In sum, only those inclined to enjoy themselves should suffer exposure to this suppurating and subversive piece of meretricious trash.(PS: I love the movie. That's why I gave it a high rating.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hoochee-koochee girls get raided in the middle of a "theatrical performance," dressed in coins singing "We're in the Money," with pluck, personality and talent, struggle to the top.This flick is dated to the point of being either movie artifact or high camp. Except that the under-appreciated actor Warren William lends a a welcomed edge to offset the ingenue boy-crooner Dick Powell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another Busby Berkeley gem. Gold Diggers was another film in the musical genre w/ comic relief. The use of sex appeal draw an audience to the cinema. That sex appeal was nothing more than using women as objects. Both as sexual objects and objects in the background. Like props, Busby Berkeley used the technique of camera angels to promote "eye candy." And it worked like a charm! Ginger Rogers also became a star in this film with her opening song "We're in the money!" Another film with both Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, Gold Diggers of 1933 was the first of several Gold Digger films that drew in audience to the cinemas in the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun To Watch, But Needed More Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't as entertaining as I had hoped it would be, simply because there wasn't enough music in here. It starts off with a bang with "We're In The Money," but then doesn't offer much else - musically - until the end of the story with three Busby Berkeley extravaganzas. One of those was very good (I liked the neon violins!) while the other two didn't do much for me. One had Joan Blondell talking-and-singing and the other was a work-march.Guy Kibbe and Ned Sparks provide some good humor to the film but I didn't think Aline MacMahon did. She was unappealing and took away from the enjoyment of watching this film.Overall, it's a very dated but still fun to watch movie. I always enjoy hearing the expressions of the day in these early 1930 films, and also always enjoy those fabulous Berkeley sets.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the better "Gold Diggers" musicals of the '30s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But having said that, there are definite drawbacks to these kind of Depression-era musicals--namely, RUBY KEELER, who admits herself that she "couldn't sing, dance or act." She does manage to get by on sheer charm but her skills are, truthfully, decidedly limited.DICK POWELL was still playing the juvenile lead in these sort of musicals, usually with someone like JOAN BLONDELL exchanging some salty wisecracks with him or giving out with her own songs when he wasn't crooning a couple of ditties.The hard times aspect of the story is easy to discern with the four showgirls sharing a tenement flat and subsiding on stolen goods like a bottle of milk from their neighbors. Very dated stuff.But Busby Berkeley's musical interludes make up for some of the slow going in the familiar plot line which has them trying to scrape together enough money for a Broadway show and then fortunate enough to latch onto Dick Powell, who comes from a monied family and also happens to sing, dance and act. GINGER ROGERS sings a song in Pig Latin in the film's opening number.The moral lassitude of the era is evident in some of the song numbers: "Pettin' in the Park" is the most obvious example but there are plenty of other "undressing" moments and bawdy gestures that seemed to permeate these pre-code films of the '30s. "Forgotten Man" is supposed to be the ode to the unemployed.Summing up: Although trivial and trite, it manages to entertain thanks to an enjoyable cast and a few good Berkeley touches in those overhead numbers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic American musical theatre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening and closing Berkley numbers, Shuffle of to Buffalo and Ballad of the Common Man, are must see masterpieces of the American musical theatre. In the context of the brutal Depression years, these numbers convey a sense of hope, fraternity and compassion that can trace its roots to the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States. It is also a classic example of that purely American, fast-talking, comic style that was the legacy of George Abbot, the great musical comedy director and writer for seventy years. The portrayal of the four aggressively rich man hunting women is so affectionate as to dismiss the any sense of misogyny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Busby Berkeley (and Some Piffle About the Depression)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gold Diggers of 1933 would be an inconsequential movie, and almost surely a forgotten one, were it not for the Busby Berkeley production numbers, which are among the most imaginative, bizarre, giddily entertaining sequences in all musical-comedy history. The film's centerpiece is perhaps the best job of work Berkeley ever did: it begins innocently enough, with Ruby Keeler and Dick Powell singing the bouncy tune "Pettin' in the Park," acting out the song's faintly naughty lyrics in literal enough fashion on a park bench, but it quickly escalates into a swirling, stream-of-consciousness collage involving ice skating cops, and a sudden rainstorm, and the linking device of a mischievous baby (played by Billy Barty, an infant-like midget who appeared in several Berkeley numbers) escaping from his carriage to launch spitballs, and behave in a precociously leering manner toward the bevy of Berkeley beauties, who become soaked by the rainstorm, and flee behind a screen to undress, and re-emerge clad in tin costumes, impervious now to the presumptuous petting of the males, Dick Powell included, who remedies the matter the only way he knows how - by whipping out a can-opener and beginning to peel away reluctant sweetheart Ruby Keeler's armor plating. Freudian connotations aside (and are there loads of them), the sequence is a supreme example of leg-fetishist Berkeley's art, his ability to begin with what appears to be a straight-forwardly staged number then take off free-associatively into a hallucinatory, pattern-obsessed netherworld where the human body becomes little more than an element in a frenzied composition, a petal on a swirling human flower. The sequence, and a later, lesser one involving neon-lit violins and a huge spiraling set, is an eruption of pure creativity in the midst of a film that is otherwise undistinguished. Indeed, the musical sequences, with the exception of the final, anti-climactic, Depression-themed "Forgotten Man" dirge, so out-class the surrounding material that in a way they destroy the movie. But destroy it in a good way, because why would anyone care otherwise about a routine comedy of show-girls on the make? Well, maybe there are a FEW other reasons to care about Gold Diggers of 1933. There's Aline MacMahon for one, the accomplished character actress, who plays the shameless chiseler Trixie with a cheerful, street-smart crassness that almost overcomes her less-than-stellar lines. There's Joan Blondell, she of the big, batting eyes and killer gams, and there's a little of Ginger Rogers, who's unbelievably adorable in the opening "We're in the Money" sequence, which requires her to sing the lyrics in Pig Latin (try it and see how easy you think it is). There's Warren William doing his poor-man's-John-Barrymore best with the thankless role of J. Lawrence Bradford, a Boston Blue-Blood, who journeys to New York to rescue his younger brother Brad (Dick Powell, adequate if insufferable) from the clutches of sweet star-on-the-rise Polly (Ruby Keeler, smiling). The performers bring class to a project that without them, and Berkeley, would be at best an unconvincing "putting-on-a-show" exercise, a ramshackle step-child of 42nd Street. The comedy is, it's safe to say, sub-par; there's only so much you can squeeze out of such a thin plot as MacMahon misleading William by pretending to be Keeler, and soaking him for everything he's worth while deflecting his attention away from Powell, who's fled his aristocratic life to become a song-writer. There's a certain spinning-in-the-mud quality to a lot of the humor; and frankly the portrayal of what it was like to be show-people in the midst of the Depression is not what you would call smashingly successful, or even very credible. It's unlikely, I imagine, that even down-on-their-luck Broadway producers were hanging around the apartments of out-of-work show-girls as much as the producer does in this film; and it's equally unlikely that a song-writer of Brad's caliber would simply drop out of the sky, and furthermore be capable of starring in the very mega-production he was responsible for scoring...but there I go getting wrapped up in reality again. Don't I realize that where Busby Berkeley is concerned all notions of reality must be tossed out the window? If I'm not going to question the plausibility of musical numbers the like of Berkeley's being carried out within the confines of a normal-sized Broadway theater, as the film expects us to believe they are, then why should I question the credibility of the rest of it? Gold Diggers of 1933 requires above all a suspension of disbelief, not only in part but in total. The film is more than rewarding enough to warrant the effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>read my comment for my summary on this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical Gold Diggers of 1933 was directed by Mervyn Leroy. This black and white film was able to grab the viewers attention without the color. The use of cartoons before the movie also gave this film a uniqueness that helped grab the attention of its viewers.After this preemie cartoon, the movie consisted of a lot of singing, music, and dancing. The dancers, beautiful girls with long skinny legs, would dance around with silver coins around their private areas, and would have other extravagant costumes. When these dancers find out their manager stopped paying his bills they were left with no job. They were left with no source of income and needed to find another job during this time of depression. After some time passed there was word that their manager Mr. Hopkins was putting on a new show and needed dancers. He arrived at all the dancers homes and said he didn't have enough money to put the show on but there was a show. This ended in Mr. Hopkins getting money from Brad, who fell in love with one of the dancers named Polly. Trixie, another dancer that is friends with Polly, thought that Mr. Hopkins had stolen the money. Although Trixie thought this she still went on with wanting to do the show because she needed money, as did everyone else.The movie Gold Diggers of 1933 was an impressive movie. At first seeing that it was black and white made me think that it would be a really old fashioned movie that wouldn't hold my attention. I was proved wrong and enjoyed watching and listening to the singing and dancing. The costumes made things alive and vibrant even though there was no color. I was surprised in the way the movie was made, since it was during the 1930's. I would defiantly recommend this movie to other people learning about Dance in films, or people who enjoy watching old fashioned movies.</fullReview>
