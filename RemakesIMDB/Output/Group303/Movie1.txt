		<shortDescription>Delicious variant on the "Old Dark House" theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, this film is way ahead of its time in foreshadowing heart transplants and (yet to be achieved) artificial hearts. The first act is all about the artificial heart thing. Act 2 is a courtroom drama about the doctor being sentenced to hang for an accidental killing of his medical student during the experiment. Act 3 is the revenge against the jurors and judge who convicted him. Each act of this melodrama is delicious but Act 3 is by far the best. My only gripe is that it ends too soon. It would have been more fun to have a few more gimmicks to revenge the conviction. This film reminds me of the classic "12 Angry Men" but is a lot more fun and to the point. Great production values for 1939.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Karloff plays Dr. Saavard, a scientist involved in creating an artificial heart and hopefully the means to extend life and perhaps realize immortality. A young man offers his services to him, and accidentally dies. Karloff is brought to trial, convicted and hung. He comes back(as we new he would from the name of the title) and seeks revenge on all those responsible for his "death." The story is fairly conventional and routine, but there are some splendid moments in the house of Karloff menacing his "guests" and letting each one know how long he or she has to live. The only real complaint I have deals with the ending which just cuts the tension that had been built up. The ending is rather make-shift and really spoiled the mood earlier created.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now a mechanical heart sounds silly...... doesn't it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dr. Henryk Savaard works with his assistant Lang and medical student Bob Roberts in Dr. Savaard's experiments in the use of a mechanical heart to prolong life. Roberts risks his life in the experiment where Savaard will kill him and bring him back from the dead. This unnerves Dr. Savaard's nurse (and Roberts' girlfriend) Betty Crawford, who sends for the police, and when they arrive arrest Dr. Savaard for killing Roberts. At his trial, Dr. Savaard tries to explain his methods and experiments were in the name of science, but they fall on deaf ears as he is convicted and sentenced to hang. He donates his body to science, and most specifically to Lang, who plans to bring him back to life using Dr. Savaard's process. Scoop Foley, a news reporter who covered the trial (and fell for Dr. Savaard's daughter Janet) notices that six members of the Savaard jury committed suicide by hanging, and that the remaining jurors, and the judge, prosecutor, police inspector, and Ms. Crawford have been invited to the Savaard house where the doctor plans to have all of them die one by one, but he doesn't expect his daughter to arrive. This is one heck of a movie with everything that the B sci-fi/horror flick should have. Watching Karloff, I can only think how much more respected he could be if he didn't have to subject himself to these B movies which he excels in. Grinde makes excellent use of camera-work, as well as shadow and light. The script does seem like it won't differ from anything else in the genre, but it continually goes further into new twists and turns with the Agatha Christie like revenge Savaard plans. My only regret is that the film wasn't longer. Excellent ending. Rating, based on B movies, 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Several Years Ahead of Its Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man They Could Not Hang" is an interesting little film if only for its foretelling of artificial hearts and organ transplants by many years.Dr. Henryk Savaard (Boris Karloff) has invented an artificial heart that has been successful in bringing animals back to life after they have been clinically dead. Savaard now wants to try the procedure on a human ans medical student Bob Roberts (Stanley Brown) agrees to be the guinea pig. His fiancé, Betty Crawford (Ann Doran), who is Savaard's nurse is fearful for Roberts' life.As the experiment begins Betty goes to the police in an attempt to stop the experiment. Reporter "Scoop" Foley (Robert Wilcox) overhears Betty's pleas and goes ahead to Savaard's home where he meets Savaard's daughter Janet (Lorna Gray) with whom he strikes up a friendship. Police Lt. Shane (Don Beddoe) arrives at Savaard's laboratory before he can bring the young man back to life, and arrests him for murder. Savaard is tried and found guilty and is sentenced to hang. Before he is sentenced, Savaard vows revenge on those who had a hand in his conviction.Following his execution, Savaard's body is turned over to his assistant Dr. Lang (Byron Foulger) who following Savaard's procedure, brings Savaard back to life. Weeks later, several of the jurors who voted for Savaard's conviction turn up hanged, apparently suicides.Using a note from trial Judge Bowman (Charles Trowbridge) as bait, Savaard lures the remaining parties for his revenge to his home and traps them therein. Included are the Judge, DA Drake (Roger Pryor), Jury Foreman Kearney (Dick Curtis), Betty Crawford, the Coroner (Joe De Stefani) and Lt. Shane. "Scoop" Foley is also entrapped having "crashed" the party.Savaard plans to systematically murder each person at 15 minute intervals. Judge Bowman is the first and dies by electrocution. Next Kearney is poisoned. Betty is targeted next, but before Savaard can complete his murderous scheme, his daughter Janet arrives and......................Karloff as usual gives a great performance. He moves from a kindly dedicated scientist to a madman bent on murder and revenge with ease.The use of an artificial heart put this modest little programmer several years ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff Movies AHEAD of the TIMES!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was by all means a head of its times with heart transplants and mechanical parts in the year 1939. This films success was encouraged by a Dr. Robert Cornish who was a biochemist hired by Columbia pictures who present the idea of a mechanical heart. Columbia signed Karloff for several more films in the same theme, staring the actor onto his second "crazed scientist" cycle. It is unbelievable that for more than twenty-five years later, human lives were successfully prolonged by surgical heart transplants. Karloff looks less menacing that he has been in the past. Karloff as usual, turns in his usual good performance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Man They Could Not Hang has to be one of Boris's better movies and I have seen it a couple of times.A mad scientist is about to do an experiment to bring somebody back to life using a special device he has invented. His assistant's girlfriend reports him to the police and they arrive before he completes the experiment and is arrested and sentenced to death. After hanging, his assistant takes his body and manages to bring him back to life and he then gets revenge on the people who senctenced him. In a struggle at the end, he is shot and he dies for the second time.This is one of my favourite Boris Karloff movies and I rather enjoyed watching this. A must for Karloff fans.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better then Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1939, public domain cheapie B-Film turned out to be much better then expected. The plot in a nut shell is this: Boris Karloff kills a medical student in order to test a procedure that will bring him back to life, only his nurse, played by Ann Doran goes to the police. Karloff is arrested, tried and hanged, but not before threatening the judge, members of the jury, his nurse and others who helped to get him sentenced to death. Once dead, a scientist who worked with Karloff brings him back to life, and he sets out killing those who sentenced him to death.If anyone has seen The House on Haunted Hill and its later remake, this film was probably used for certain inspiration for this film. You have a group of people, all associated with the case, who are all brought to a deserted house, locked inside, and are slowly killed off one by one. The film is short, just a little over an hour in length, but is top notch entertainment, and is very enjoyable, and well acted.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, the assistant's girlfriend is scared and runs to the police. They arrive before Savaard can complete the experiment and the assistant dies. Savaard is convicted and executed for murder. However, another assistant uses the artificial heart to bring him back to life. But the good doctor is batspit crazy and out for blood.

		<shortDescription>The Man They Could Not Hang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hell hath no fury like Dr. Saavard! Boris Karloff stars as Dr. Saavard, a scientist condemned to hang for killing a volunteering subject whose artificial heart transplant procedure is interrupted by police. He and assistant Lang(Byron Foulger)had induced death by using gas to stop the test subject's heart when the dead man's fiancé,and Saavard's nurse Betty Crawford(Ann Doran), afraid for her boyfriend's well-being, goes to the police hoping to save him before he is put out. The police and doctor on call would not allow Saavard one hour to save his guinea pig's life and is put on trial for murder. When the jury sentences Saavard to hang, he has one last chance to tell those who ultimately had his life in their hands that they would pay for killing such a scientist who could do good for humanity instead of bad. Once he is dead, assistant Lang resurrects Saavard with the artificial heart..Saavard, full of rage and anger towards those blind with disbelief in the human advancement of science in saving others through medical achievements too narrow-minded to see the future, will see that six of those jury members who were adamant in his execution would die the way he did. Then he tricks the judge, attorneys, coroner, &amp; Betty into meeting at his house, locking them into a living room with booby traps killing them at an appointed time while he torments them across an intercom. Booby traps include an electrical grid that holds them in the room, a poison-needled phone receiver, and plans to shoot Betty with a rifle when he cuts out the lights. The only escape for the group is Saavard's daughter, Janet(Lornay Gray) who arrives to find what her father has done..she had not know that her father was actually alive and will push for the madness to stop.Moves at such a fast pace, I wished it would continue. The premise is really spectacular considering Karloff could lock away those he deemed a threat to medical progress. I think his Dr. Savaard was more enraged about that than his being executed. In a sense, he wasn't on trial(in his mind anyway)as much as his desire to see the advancement of life for future generations..yet, here are these cynics who believe this isn't feasible and condemn him to death, eliminating a bright mind that could possibly advance human life. I think what was thrilling to me was how Savaard not only proves them wrong using his mere presence as the example, but his having them cornered like rats with no escape. Karloff has two scenes with dialogue he delivers so soundly and painfully, I shuttered. It's so convincing, his argument regarding what they were doing..and did..to him. Great little B-movie that deserves to be seen by Karloff enthusiasts. Yet, in honesty, he was quite mad and any argument he could've made regarding his miracle of science was lost when he decided to seek retribution. I think the final scene was perfect..if they wanted him gone, there was no way in hell the community would benefit from his genius.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff plays a scientist who discovers a way to prolong people's lives. To try it out, he has to kill someone. When his plan is discovered, they arrest him, convict him and execute him. But, as the title identifies, it doesn't end there. To be certain, he invites the jurors to his house and explains how one person will perish every fifteen minutes. Then, it starts happening."The Man They Could Not Hang" is outlandish, definitely, but it's kind of a neat movie. The ending was sort of a cop-out, but most of the movie was pretty fun. Karloff's eerie stare is enough to carry a movie all by itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back, Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It isn't such a bad movie. It's just how many times does Boris Karloff get the same script. He is hanged or electrocuted or done in in some way and someone manages to bring him back. Of course, he's not the man he used to be. In this one, his work is compromised, costing a young assistant his life, due to a panic stricken girl. When his partner brings him back, he decides to kill the jury, the judge, the prosecuting attorney. It's a sort of "And Then There Were None" thing but doesn't work as well as the Rene Clair film. The device invented looks silly but is a precursor to an artificial heart. The science is bad but the idea is ahead of its time. There is a great courtroom speech that is hard to deny, but they hang him anyway. Still, I love this guy and am impressed by his acting. It's too bad he got himself typecast so badly. He did have some very nice dramatic roles, but most of it was this kind of thing. See it anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE MAN THEY COULD NOT HANG (Nick Grinde', 1939) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first of Karloff's cycle of "Mad Doctor" B-films for Columbia and, given that somehow I was under the impression that this was considered the least of them, I was surprised to find it great fun throughout. Essentially, all the films had similar plots (and it's interesting to see how the star's looks changed from one title to the next) - with Karloff on the verge of some great discovery or other but who's always thwarted at the proverbial 11th hour by thick-headed police and other figures of authority!; in fact, they're so teeth-grindingly stupid here that Karloff's conversion from dedicated scientist to cold-blooded killer was actually quite convincing!! The star is in really fine form in this film - especially effective when delivering his threatening final statement before the court passes sentence on him and then, following his resurrection (complete with broken neck a' la Bela Lugosi's Ygor!), when exacting his elaborate and sinister revenge plan. In fact, the second half - intriguingly modeled on Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Indians/And Then There Were None" - is even more entertaining than the first. seeing how it finds all who remain of Karloff's intended victims being locked up in one room of his house (with all exits having been systematically blocked and wired with electricity!) and allowing 15 minutes between one execution and the next. Of course, his plans go sadly awry in the end as he hadn't counted on the presence of his daughter (alerted to Karloff's reappearance by her snooping reporter boyfriend) and, when she eventually 'sacrifices' her life to save that of Karloff's unwilling guests, he sees the error of his ways and willingly accepts death anew from a bullet wound. Unfortunately, there's a hokey, tacked-on happy ending of sorts - with Karloff's daughter getting resurrected in the nick of time, through the use of his own invention, before he himself expires.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Always remember that I offered you life, and you gave me death".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, talk about a picture that was way ahead of it's time! The mechanical heart business and replacement body parts is one thing, but how about the idea of lowering one's body temperature and reducing respiration down to zero to simulate a 'state of death'. Current studies in cryogenics is making inroads into just such treatments that have arisen from cases of victims drowning who have been revived after being unconscious and considered clinically dead. Lowering body temperature has been found to be a valuable component in the process.Well this story has a bit of the 'Ten Little Indians' flavor going for it after Dr. Henryk Savaard was found guilty of murder. What I found interesting about Karloff's role in this was that he didn't seem to be the mad scientist type once you got past the idea that he was going to 'kill' his assistant in order to revive him using the scientific method he perfected. He sounded perfectly rational in his own defense, but then again, so do all the crazed lunatics who maintain a firm belief in their ideas.So the idea that Savaard turns around and intends to knock off the judge, prosecuting attorney and the remaining jurors who he's summoned to his home for revenge is understandably logical given his rationale. His invention would have gone on to save countless lives had he been able to complete the initial grand experiment for which he was arrested, tried and convicted. Of course, all of this would have been a moot point if Savaard himself hadn't been brought back from the great beyond himself. I have to admit though, the explanation for his broken neck escaped me.A few years prior to this picture, Boris Karloff portrayed another character who was brought back from the dead in a film appropriately titled "The Walking Dead". Both stories featured impressively detailed laboratories filled with scientific looking gizmos and technical gadgetry that made the mad scientist gimmick most noteworthy. Of the two pictures, this is probably the better one given Karloff's effective dialog in defense of his scientific theories, before, during and after his ultimate date with destiny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intelligent Crime Story Stars Karloff, Who Shines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man They Could Not Hang" is certainly a very watchable film. On the surface, it appears to be another mad-scientist-defies-nature story, but it has deeper roots.Dr. Henryk Savaard (Boris Karloff) has designed an artificial heart and has tested it on various animals. A young man volunteers to be the first human recipient, so Savaard and his assistant terminate the man's life only to be interrupted mid-procedure, before they can restore the man's life.What follows is a courtroom drama, then an Agatha Christie-like murder in a box, with a twist. At each phase of the film, Dr. Savaard delivers a speech about science vs. ignorance, each with its own perspective. Each speech is well written and takes the story beyond the typical mad doctor genre.This film does not fall into the horror genre. Perhaps the mere presence of Karloff prompted that labelling. But Savaard may be the most rational character in the film. It is a sci-fi crime story. And it is well worth watching and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I guess that Harry Cohn at Columbia must have liked what Jack Warner did with Boris Karloff in The Walking Dead. A few years later Boris was over at Columbia doing The Man They Could Not Hang with the same resurrection type film theme.Karloff is once again a misunderstood scientist experimenting just as he was experimented on in Frankenstein. Only Karloff was a corpse dug up for Colin Clive's experiment. In this film he's the scientist and he kills one of his students to bring him back. Only it doesn't work and he's up for murder in a state where they hang one.Karloff was also resurrected in The Walking Dead and was exacting revenge on folks who did him wrong. Same here it's the 12 jurors, the judge, the DA, and the faithless girlfriend of his experiment subject Ann Doran. Only his daughter Lorna Gray stands by Karloff and she's having trouble grasping what's going on.Although Karloff is both terrifying and pitiable as he is in some of his greatest horror roles. I liked The Walking Dead far better than this one. Karloff fans should approve though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Favorite Karloff Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite Boris Karloff films. The movie is a bit ahead of it's time - the idea of prolonging human life by scientific means.Karloff plays Dr. Henryk Savaard. A very kindly man who's sole purpose is to prolong the human lifespan. Bob Roberts is a medical student and agrees to be his guinea pig - things go wrong when Dr. Savaard's nurse, Betty Crawford, is fearful of Bob's life and goes to the police. The police arrive during the experiment and arrest Dr. Savaard for murder. Dr. Savaard is found guilty of murder and sentenced to death by hanging. After the hanging, Dr. Savaard's body is turned over to his assistant Dr. Lang who performs the experimental surgery on Savaard. Savaard is now "resurrected" and turns into a madman that seeks revenge on those that had him sentenced to death.This film is a great companion film to Karloff's Before I Hang (1940). The title of the two films seems backwards but once you watch both films you will understand the titles are appropriate and not backwards.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't keep a mad Boris Karloff ? hanging!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really liked "The Man They Could Not Hang"! It's definitely one of the best ? probably even THE best ? of all the "mad scientist" movies released during the 1930s / 1940s and starring the almighty Boris Karloff in the role of megalomaniac doctor or professor (and these are quite numerous)! In fact, I loved this particular movie so much that it was one of those rare occasions where I regretted the fact that horror movies from this era are so short and to-the-point! I usually think it's a giant advantage that these films only last like 60-70 minutes, but in case of "The Man They Could Not Hung", I really wished that Karloff's mad-raving behavior would last another half an hour extra! There were most other contemporary titles of this kind are soft and overly talkative, this one is non-stop packed with action, suspense and deeply fascinating medical theories! Brilliant scientist Henryk Savaard is on the verge of writing medical history with his invention of a mechanical heart that can bring dead patients back to life after they have been operated. Savaard's student/assistant volunteers to test the device, but his girlfriend goes haywire and alerts the police. They break into the laboratory before Savaard has the opportunity to resurrect his guinea pig and ? boom ? the poor doctor gets accused of murder and sentenced to death by hanging! In court, Savaard transforms from a civilized scientist into an insane killer and vows to destroy everyone responsible for his death: judge, jury, crazy girlfriend and skeptical colleagues! A few weeks later, they all receive an invitation to come to a secluded old mansion; Agatha Christie style! Here, there are awaited by their very much alive host Savaard and subjected to a series of vile death traps? What I personally liked most about "The Man They Could Not Hang" ? maybe even more than the delicious 'old dark house' climax ? is the realism of Dr. Savaard's research. To put it in his own absorbing words: "To operate on a living body is like trying to repair a motor when it's still running? It would make more sense to switch off all bodily functions during an operation and then turn them back on when the operation was successful". That actually makes sense! Savaard isn't just another crazed professor aiming at immortality or creating new life, but a devoted doctor with a vision! I was definitely supporting him before and during his trial, and even when he was extracting his vengeance (although admittedly he goes a little over-the-top there?). This is, simply put, a massively entertaining black-and-white chiller with a splendid screenplay and an excellent Karloff performance. Director Nick Grindé does a more than adequate job as well. He would make two more mad scientist movies with Karloff, namely "Before I Hang" and "The Man with Nine Lives", but this one is my favorite.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff plays a mad doctor(surprise!) bent on revenge. In this fast paced effort, we see Karloff emotionally bounce from dignified to devilish and everything in between. Great acting and a neat and very entertaining story. The low budget certainly did not harm this movie at all. This one has a lot of heart, no pun intended. Ironically, it is the one person closest to the doctors own heart that offers the potential victims of his revenge a small chance of a reprieve. Karloff and black and white horror go together like peanut butter and jelly. The expressive manner of Karloff, the crags and lines on his face, the intonation of his voice, the way his talents are used here, plus the prophetic medical story that is presented, all of this combine to make this barely- one- hour and well made film a not to be missed gem by any fan of vintage old school horror....</fullReview>

Here he plays a doctor who is wronged by a legal system, only to take his revenge in an even more cruel manner.The film has become a bit prescient in its portrayal of surgery, although the actual machines used for heart surgery is likely nothing close to what they were using here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unremarkable but entertaining.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first in a series of four Boris Karloff vehicles to have basically the same plot, "The Man They Could Not Hang" stars the horror icon as Dr. Henryk Savaard, who's experimenting on bringing people back to life with artificial hearts. (That does make this movie well ahead of its time.) He ends up charged with murder, convicted, and hanged. But an associate of his is able to resuscitate Savaard using his own techniques, and now the crazed Savaard is ripe for revenge.This movie doesn't play out quite the way that this viewer would have expected. It's rather slow to get going, and has a lot more talk than action, but it becomes great fun in its third act. Savaard doesn't go about stalking his victims, at least not all of them, but gathers a group of them together in an Old Dark House type situation. This whole sequence features some ingenious murdering devices."The Man They Could Not Hang" may be short on atmosphere, but what it does have is yet another absolutely marvelous Karloff performance. He was always at his best when it really looked like he was enjoying himself (see also "The Body Snatcher"), and here he makes the most of his material. The Savaard character is prone to giving speeches and taunting his victims, and the dialogue just rolls off Karloffs' tongue with ease.The supporting is good even when they have less interesting and showy roles to play. Beautiful Lorna Gray plays Savaards' daughter, Robert Wilcox is a stubborn reporter, Don Beddoe gruffly portrays the police lieutenant, Charles Trowbridge is solid as the huffy judge, and Ann Doran is cast as Betty, the young nurse who chooses to go behind Savaards' back.Other than a much too hasty and unsatisfying conclusion, this is enjoyable stuff worth catching for any fan of its star.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boris Karloff is a seemingly good doctor who has invented a mechanical heart he hopes to utilize on his nurse's boyfriend in order to alleviate the suffering of mankind. The young man has agreed to be medically put to death in order to be revived with the new heart installed. However, the frantic nurse turns him in, Karloff is arrested and sentenced to death. Members of the jury who voted for his execution, the D.A. and the judge are all invited to Karloff's house by a "mystery" host whom even the servants hired for the evening haven't seen.This is a tale of revenge, and it would really work if Karloff's character had been sent up as a vindictive man who had more interest in achieving immortality through giving to humanity than one who had humanity at the forefront of his motivation. Karloff's sudden rampage against the jury and other members of the court comes out of nowhere, and this gives the impression that there was really no consistency in the writer's idea of who this character was. The film moves at a quick pace and has some clever and macabre ideas to it, culminating in an eerie conclusion which involves Karloff's innocent daughter (Lorna Gray). But had someone pointed out the lack of motivation or twisted reasons for Karloff's demented change in personality then the film might have been a lot better. Director Nick Grinde and Karloff would get together the following year for the similarly titled "Before I Hang" which in retrospect is the better of the two films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff is... The Man They Could Not Hang</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film concerns Dr. Henryk Savaard, a man who has found a method of bringing the dead back to life by means of a mechanical heart. When he tries the method on a human subject, a medical student who volunteered, the police interfere and he is sentenced to death as they would not allow him the chance to revive his patient. Savaard however donates his body to science, more specifically, his assistant Lang who he trusted to do the try the experiment on himself. Lang revives Savaard and Savaard then turns to revenge, revenge on the people who put him to death in the first place.Karloff is masterful here, in what I think could be, or at least one of, his finest performances. He portrays Savaard as a man who loves his craft, a man who wants to help people and see's his method of eternal life as a gift that could make mankind better and stronger than it ever was. However , Karloff also portrays a different Savaard, a man who now see's mankind as undeserving of his gift and intends to take his secret of eternal life to his grave.The films first portion is much like Courtroom-Drama and includes one of Karloff's most well delivered monologues. First of helping people and trying to make the Jury understand why he did what he did, and then threatening and promising revenge on all the people who put him to death. The second portion is a revenge-thriller where Savaard traps all the remaining people he hasn't killed already in his house. Karloff's performance here is amazing, he says he is above the law, he says they are all going to die, in what order and what time exactly. The film is really tense after that and you start to wonder how could he possibly kill off these people in an exact order and at a specific time, well he does do it and it does get quite creative but sadly, only 2 people are killed before things get complicated. Thats my only real complaint with the film, I would have liked to have seen 1 or 2 more creative deaths before the final.Overall, The Man They Could Not Hang was a fantastic film for Karloff, who portrayed one of his most interesting characters and gave a performance to be remembered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun and menacingly effective if standard</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man They Could Not Hang is a very solidly done film but falls short of greatness. The ending is tacky and felt somewhat like two endings in one. The first third does take its time to get going, it sets things up well but compared to what comes after it was a little dull, while the music is rather stock and you can tell that several composers were responsible. The Man They Could Not Hang looks very good however with fluid photography and creepy settings, while the script is witty and clever with a foreboding tone that really makes its impact, and the story may be standard but it is still very neatly told with the suspense levels appropriately sinister and the fun factor deliciously entertaining. The last third apart from the ending fares by far the best, that's fun and enough to make you bite the nails. The acting is good, Lorna Gray comes off best in the supporting cast, all competent but none make the same impression that Boris Karloff. Karloff is good reason to see any film and he is the best thing about The Man They Could Not Hang. He has an effortless eerie command and does it with his usual style and dignity. The artificial heart and organ transplant stuff is also very ahead of its time, and a further source of interest. Overall, standard with a hokey ending, stock music and a slow start but lots of fun and very effective in atmosphere and as ever Karloff is great. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Tried.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nick Grinde directed Boris Karloff as Dr. Savaard, a researcher into life and death who is working with a student on an experiment where he will be killed and returned to life, when it is interrupted by his foolish girlfriend, who gets Savaard arrested for murder(he didn't have enough time to resurrect the student) He is then tried, convicted, and hanged, but an assistant takes his body back to the lab, and after some neck reconstruction surgery, is returned to life. He then plots a campaign of revenge against all those responsible for his hanging... Boris Karloff is fine, and film has some potential, but it is squandered in a standard revenge tale that proves most unsatisfying; a bit more imagination and ambition could have made this good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man They Could Not Hang (1939) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE MAN THEY COULD NOT HANG (1939) is the first of a few films in the Columbia canon which have been dubbed Karloff's "Mad Doctor Series". Directed by Nick Grinde, here we have Boris as the well-meaning Dr. Savaard, who has developed a method for restoring the dead back to life after temporarily stopping their hearts, which may then allow surgeons to more successfully operate on their patients before bringing them back. Unfortunately, when the local police burst into his laboratory as he is working on his first volunteer, he is accused of murder and is then sentenced to be hanged. But after the execution is carried out, Savaard returns via his own procedure and then seeks revenge on the judge and jurors who convicted him. Karloff is at his menacing best in one of the more fulfilling horrors in this series. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hanging with Mr Karloff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Man They Couldn't Hang: 6 out of 10: The title is a bit of a misnomer after all they do hang him (and break his neck in the process) he just doesn't stay dead. I figure a man they couldn't hang would be morbidly obese or have a thick neck or something.The movie has Karloff as a mad scientist experimenting with his artificial heart gizmo (That is a dead ringer for a modern dialysis machine) and when the experiment goes wrong he is sentenced to death. (Karloff's characters really need better lawyers he is always getting a capital sentence for what is basically accidental manslaughter) The doctor now mad seeks revenge on the jury that convicted him by inviting them to his house and trying to kill them off one by one. The movie really gets good at this point but it ends much too soon. Another half an hour in the house with various traps would have done wonders.Foreshadowing both modern medical technology and House on Haunted Hill, The Man They Couldn't Hang is a good movie with a disappointingly truncated ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A scientist's work is greatly misunderstood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fascinating! Boris Karloff stars as Dr. Henryk Savaard, whose cutting-edge research is proved by his own death...and rebirth. Weird and exciting for movie goers in the 1939. The scientist is totally obsessed with his research of bringing the dead back to life. A young medical student with faith in the doctor offers himself to be put to death, but before Savaard can bring him back to life...he is arrested and convicted of murder and sentenced to hang. The unappreciated Savaard vows revenge on the judge and jury. The sentence is carried out and an assistant of the now deceased Savaard claims the body and revives him proving the unimaginable technique actually works. A vengeful and justly manic Savaard begins killing his doubters. Other players include: Lorna Gray, Joe De Stefani, Robert Wilcox, Roger Pryor and Don Beddoe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Derivative, yes...still still quite enjoyable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1930s, Boris Karloff made several films with VERY similar plots. In these films, he was killed and returned to life--with BAD results. The main plot for this film is from Karloff's "The Walking Dead" and very similar to "The Man Who Lived Again". Clearly "The Man They Could Not Hang" was a VERY derivative film! Yet, despite the very repetitive nature of these films, they are very enjoyable.The film begins with Karloff doing some strange research that will allow him to do heart transplants. He gets one of his assistants to allow him to kill him--with the intention that he would then revive him with his new experimental system. However, the assistant's girlfriend (Ann Doran) is an idiot. Instead of letting Karloff finish the experiment, she runs for the police. The police break in and won't allow Karloff to revive the man--insisting it isn't possible and jailing him. Soon, Karloff is indicted for murder and is tried, convicted and sentenced to death. However, another assistant is able to obtain Karloff's corpse and soon revives the once-good doctor. However, now Karloff is no longer a kindly researcher but decides to spend the rest of the film killing everyone responsible for his death sentence. I liked this portion best, but unfortunately, his quest is cut short and the film ends.Overall, enjoyable and Karloff, once again, is terrific. The only big problem, other than the repetitive nature of the script, is the acting of Doran--who, frankly, was terrible in the few scenes in which she appeared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Man They Could Not Hang, The (1939) ** 1/2 (out of 4) Boris Karloff plays a crazed scientist who is obsessed with bringing the dead back to life. He tries his new machine on a dead college student but before he can bring the kid back to life the police show up and he is eventually sentenced to death. The scientist swears vengeance on the jury, judge and prosecutor if he can live through the hanging. This was the first of four "mad scientist" films that Karloff made for Columbia and it's certainly the weakest. The film starts off pretty well but it slowly grows tiresome and ends with a very poor finale, which is a cheat, silly and just comes off bad. Karloff is actually pretty good in the first half of the film as we see him really playing crazy like he wasn't offered too many times. Quite often he was the nice mad scientist but here is actually gets to come off pretty crazy and messed up in the head. This might take sympathy away from him for later in the film but I liked his character early on. The second half of the film turns into your typical revenge thriller and doesn't add anything new or original to the mix. The supporting cast is also rather disappointing even though Lorna Gray comes off fairly well. None of these Columbia films with Karloff are overly special but the good news here is that this one runs just over an hour, which makes for some mild entertainment but if you want to see classic Karloff then you'll have to look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie I first saw on TV back in the early 1970's, was and still one of the scariest of Karloffs works. He did a fine job as a scientist trying to bring the dead back to life. Question is: Who killed the doctors assistant, him, or the towns people who crashed the labs, and destroyed all of the machines that could have brought the dead assistant back to life???</fullReview>
