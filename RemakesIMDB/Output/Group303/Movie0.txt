		<shortDescription>The Walking Dead (1936) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stylish and expert hybrid between gangster drama and horror (of the mad scientist and zombie variety) made by a studio and director who had cut their teeth on the former but who proved equally adept at the latter on occasion; as for star Boris Karloff, he fared better here than in BLACK Friday (1940), a not dissimilar concoction.Karloff, as always, is remarkable and very moving as the hapless 'monster': his characterization draws on a few of his previous roles - THE CRIMINAL CODE (1931), FRANKENSTEIN (1931), THE RAVEN (1935) - but also looks forward to Karloff's "Mad Doctor" cycle which began with THE INVISIBLE RAY (1936). Edmund Gwenn is also effective in one of his earlier roles as the doctor who brings Karloff back to life after he is wrongly executed: obsessed by an urge to learn what goes on after death, he drives Karloff on but the latter's only concern is to get even with the corrupt gang which set him up (including Ricardo Cortez's shady lawyer, Barton MacLane as one of his associates and Joe Sawyer as a hit-man, the real murderer).The film's best moments feature Karloff's zombie rampage which, incongruous as that may seem, have a touch of poetry about them - not least because of the way that every member of the gang dies by his own hand through accident rather than Karloff's! At first, I was wary of the fact that a barely conscious Karloff could travel and somehow reach the gang's home addresses (of which he could have had no prior knowledge) in order to exact his revenge, but it is later suggested that Karloff became all-knowing in the hereafter - which is, after all, what every religion foresees for its believers.THE WALKING DEAD is a solid little film and I hope that someday Warners releases a Box Set of their lesser-known horror catalogue, to include THE MAD GENIUS (1931), DOCTOR X (1932), THE MASK OF FU MANCHU (1932), MAD LOVE (1935), MARK OF THE VAMPIRE (1935), THE DEVIL-DOLL (1936), THE RETURN OF DR. X (1939) and THE BEAST WITH FIVE FINGERS (1946)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>King Karloff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eerie, creepy, beautifully shot oddity, the kind of stuff they just wouldn't know how to make any more (not that they would want to). Karloff gives a fine performance as the gaunt, haunted patsy in a murder rap. Stand-out scene is definitely the fantastic build up to Karloff's undeserved execution, as sad cello music plays and prison guards banter about baseball while a man's life hangs in the balance. The ideas dry up a bit as King Karloff haunts his killers, but his sinister solemnity captivates the interest, and it's all crammed into little more than an hour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor Horror Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dispersed throughout the Universal reign of horror in the thirties came several remarkably well-made MGM and Warner Brother horror films. The Walking Dead is one such film produced by Warner Bros. that mixes their predominant genre of expertise, the gangster film, with the horror film. You might say in a way that it is a blend of reality and the supernatural. This film has stood the test of time well, and is a nice, taut story of a man wrongly accused of a crime, miraculously brought back to life, and eventually seeking vindication and justice from those that did him wrong. Karloff is a masterful lead in that he is able to frighten us and exact from us a tremendous amount of pity and understanding. In point of fact, his characterization of Ellman is one of his most powerful and sympathetic, a true tragic hero toyed with by crime bosses and a corrupt lawyer. Most of the acting beyond Karloff is rather pedestrian, with Edmund Gwenn turning in a nice portrayal of a questioning scientist and Ricardo Cortez wonderfully playing the stereotypical slimy lawyer. Curtiz does a good job of direction and lighting and shading are used to almost perfect results. A must see for the classic horror buff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique horror/gangster film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a one of a kind--combination horror/gangster! Karloff (who's just incredible) is bought back from the dead after being wrongfully executed and takes revenge on those who set him up. It's basically a gangster film until the last half hour--then the scary stuff kicks in. The film is VERY short (70 minutes) and moves quickly. It's intelligent (although bringing a person back from the dead after they've been electrocuted is a stretch!), very well-directed (effective use of shadows and camera angles) but the main reason to watch is Karloff. He never received the attention he deserved because he made horror films, which are still looked down upon. He was a wonderful actor and in this movie gives one of his best performances ("The Black Room" is probably THE best he ever gave). Just check out his expression after he "kills" the men he goes after. Excellent job. A perfect "B" movie. Don't miss it! I don't believe this is on video (I saw it on TCM), so if you get a chance, SEE IT! You won't be disappointed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>walking conscience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to agree with those who consider Karloff an underrated actor. Given the nature of this film and its fantastic premise, he brings a real subtlety to the role. After each of his antagonists meet their untimely demise, there is just a hint of remorse and sadness. Who else in the horror genre would have underplayed it like that? Karloff becomes the walking conscience of his tormentors and apart from the films failings regarding plot, effects etc., I think it works quite nicely on the level of allegory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Now Fear This: DEAD MAN WALKING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WALKING DEAD (Warner Brothers, 1936), directed by Michael Curtiz, is an interesting little item from the "horror" genre of the 1930s. Naturally starring Boris Karloff, but surprisingly produced and released by Warner Brothers instead of by Universal, where films of this sort were filmed and Karloff under studio contract. Being a Warners film, this also has the trademarks of its very own popular genre, the "gangster" story, yet, in this case, the use of modern-day setting with the blend gangsters with tales of the supernatural and science fiction. The story opens with Judge Roger Shaw (Joseph King), in spite of threats from the mob, convicting a racketeer named Steven Martin (Kenneth Harlan) to a ten year prison sentence. Nolan (Ricardo Cortez), Martin's lawyer, sets out to do away with the judge by arranging one of his fellow racketeers, "Trigger" Smith (Joseph Sawyer), to employ John Ellman (Boris Karloff), an out-of-work musician out on parole for two weeks following his ten year prison sentence, to "spy" on Shaw, the judge who also had sent him up, on the grounds that Shaw's wife suspects her husband of being unfaithful, and all Ellman has to do is watch his house and take notes. One night while spying on Shaw by his property, the judge is murdered elsewhere by the gangsters who take the body and leave it in the back seat of Ellman's car. At the same time, this is witnessed by a young couple, Jimmy and Nancy (Warren Hull and Marguerite Churchill), who remain silent after they are personally threatened. After Ellman notices the couple driving away, he discovers the body in his car. The next scene shifts to the courtroom where Ellman pleads his innocence and that there are witnesses who can verify his story, but with the "help" of his attorney Nolan, he gets him convicted of first degree murder and to face execution. On the night he is to go to the electric chair, Jimmy and Nancy come forth to Doctor Beaumont (Edmund Gwenn), their employer and scientist, who immediately telephones Nolan to contact the governor to stop the execution. Nolan purposely awaits until it is too late, and by then, the death sentence is carried out. Beaumont orders the autopsy to be stopped so that he may revive the body. After Ellman is brought back from the dead, he appears in a "zombie" state of mind, remembering nothing, but knowing precisely whom his enemies are, and through a supernatural force, goes after each one of those gangsters to learn why they had him framed, only to witness their destinies through accidental occurrences.Featured in the supporting cast are Warner Brothers stock company of Barton MacLane as Loder; Henry O'Neill as District Attorney Werner; Addison Richards as the Prison Warden; Eddie Acuff as Mitchell; with Paul Harvey as Blackstone and Robert Strange as Merritt. Boris Karloff is no stranger in playing a corpse resurrected from the dead. His role as The Monster in FRANKENSTEIN (Universal, 1931) or THE MUMMY (Universal, 1932), immediately come to mind, yet, in this production, he somehow resembles the monster, but in this case, doesn't go out on a murderous rampage in spite that he actually does have just cause to avenge his evil doers. Karloff's John Ellman is actually a gentle soul who, after being executed for a crime for which he is innocent, retains his gentleness even through his second life, yet, succeeds in bringing fright through his eyes to those who had done him wrong. He even finds peace and tranquility while roaming about the cemetery. Being a musician and pianist himself, he has a favorite musical piece, a somewhat quiet but moody composition he asks to be played as he walks his last mile to the execution chamber. As for the music, Ellman adds, "I like to think Heaven like that." After his "resurrection" by Doctor Beaumont, the story occasionally shifts to mystic overtones as Beaumont tries to learn from Ellman his experience in death. At one point, Ellman responds, "Leave the dead to their Maker. The Lord our God is a jealous God."In many ways, THE WALKING DEAD is highly original in its premise and during its short 66 minutes, starts off a bit slowly with some intrusive "comedy relief" provided by Eddie Acuff, whose sure thing in making wagers which turns out to be a bad gamble, but soon builds itself to a fast and memorable conclusion. During its second half, the movie plays like a "film noir" mystery with its dark atmospheric background along with some very creepy stalking from the titled character. THE WALKING DEAD may not be Academy Award winning material, but will guarantee to win a new and appreciative audience whenever shown on Turner Classic Movies. (**)</fullReview>

He's brought back to life when his name is cleared and confronts each of the men who framed him with his knowledge from beyond the grave. The execution scene is absolutely excruciating, as the only witnesses to the crime try to get the corrupt governor to call in a pardon while the music-loving Karloff walks to the electric chair, accompanied by a cello.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Framed Boris Returns From The Dead...With Deadly Results</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is interesting because Karloff does end up a figure of doom to many people, but unlike other films his victims are not sympathetic at all, and he is not murderous. He has been framed for a killing by a group of criminals led by Ricardo Cortez and Barton MacLane, and is sent to the electric chair. But Edmund Gwenn has designed a method of restoring life, and does so to Karloff. The problem is that Cortez and the others are not too happy about his resurrection, especially as he seems to be omniscient towards them about their guilt. But he is also increasingly able to bring about their demises, all in rather horrific fashion.The trick that is being missed in most of the reviews of the film that are listed here is that Karloff is not really an avenging type here. His personality comes out in the first twenty minutes of the film, where he is panicking because of the tightening noose of fake circumstantial evidence brought against him, and then by his gradually accepting his doom as impossible to avoid. When he returns from the dead, he is silent (one could add "as the tomb" and be correct). He does not have much to say, and attempts by Gwenn and the others to ask him what life is like on the other side are met with quick dismissive comments. But it is soon apparent that Karloff is not really happy being back alive. He was, despite the unfair way it was brought about, at peace when he died. He and God knew he was innocent.The various "revenge deaths" are actually not revenge at all. Boris leaves his rooms with Gwenn and walks about town. He traces down Joe Sawyer and other villains, and they see him walk in "zombie-like" but also as a figure of doom. And each one accidentally dies by their own hand. And each time Karloff comes out of his trance after they die - and is as amazed at their demise as they probably were.The question the viewer should ask is why did the scriptwriter not have Boris kill these villains as they deserve. The answer is simple. When his character John Ellman died, Ellman had been framed for the crime. Although executed as a murderer, in reality Ellman was totally innocent. Depending on one's religious views, Ellman apparently died in a state of grace with God. He is forcibly brought back from the dead by man-made method, and yet is already marked as one who was blameless at death. He can't be changed now into an avenging creature. He can be used to cause panic among his enemies so they can cause their own demise. But as he is just an innocent instrument to rekindle justified fear in the hearts of evil men who destroyed him and the murder victim, he can maintain his state of innocence. Which he does. Even as he returns to the dead at the end, he still does not have any chance to describe heaven. And earlier he did mention that God is a jealous God.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gangster's led by Nolan (Ricardo Cortez) want to have a local law abiding judge killed, in doing so, they frame an ex-con, John Ellman (Boris Karloff) for the murder. Nolan acts as Ellman's lawyer and makes certain he is convicted and executed in the electric chair. Dr. Beaumont(Edmund Gwenn), a scientist is able to restore life to dead animals and seeks permission to try reviving Ellman's dead body. Dr. Beaumont is successful in restoring Ellman back to life. Boris Karloff goes on a killing rampage, running through graveyards making this picture very melodramatic with its black and white setting. Edmund Gwenn (Santa Claus in "Miracle on 42nd Street) gives a very dramatic performance doing his very best to help Karloff. There is a great supporting cast with Marguerite Churchill, Warren Hull, Barton MacLane and Joseph Sawyer. This is truly a great Classic film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was their guilt that killed them!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This neat little Warner Brothers thriller with touches of science fiction and horror is the story of a group of legal eagles who find out that a man that they've sent to the electric chair (Boris Karloff) is innocent and delay their call to the governor to save his life. Scientist Edmund Gwenn, already convinced of his innocence, manages to bring him back through utilizing an experiment he was on the verge of perfecting, and the resurrected Karloff is a man who may or may not be obsessed with revenge. He confronts several of the men, including the one who framed him in the first place, and they die, but not as a result of his hands.The insinuation here is that the men, so paranoid of his vengeance, drove themselves to their deaths. Warner Brothers, so adept in prison and gangster films, throws in a bit of Universal style horror to make a better than average "B" film with some good character performances (Barton MacLane is memorably malevolent as one of the criminals) and usual romantic hero Ricardo Cortez as a bad guy. Karloff gives a sympathetic portrayal a the victim of the law's evil ambitions. Gwenn's obsession with the idea of knowing what happened in the hour that Karloff was dead adds an interesting twist that should have the viewer thinking on a lot of different levels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Leave the dead to their Maker".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reading most of the other viewer comments on this board, I was surprised that virtually no one had anything to say about the whitish 'L' shaped band in Boris Karloff's hair. It was reminiscent of Humphrey Bogart's skunk like streak in "The Return of Dr. X" where he portrayed a vampire of all things! In "The Walking Dead", Karloff is an ex-con brought back from the dead after being framed for a murder he didn't commit. Once revived, he exacts his revenge on the gang that set him up, using a psychic link from the beyond to track them down and lead them to their doom. For the premise of the story to work however, one has to get beyond the point where the murdered Judge Shaw was connected to the car John Ellman (Karloff) was driving. With no one around, why wouldn't Ellman simply have found a place to dump the body?The other thing that bothered me was why the conflicted young couple working for Dr. Beaumont waited until the evening of Ellman's scheduled execution to come clean with their story. I mean Jimmy (Warren Hull) was jumping right out of his skin at the trial to tell what he knew, and it didn't strike me convincingly that Nancy (Marguerite Churchill) would let an innocent man die. I know, then there wouldn't have been a story, but gee, that makes them the film's really, REALLY bad guys, doesn't it?I must say, I was unusually impressed by the size and scope of Dr. Beaumont's (Edmund Gwenn) laboratory. It looked like Warner Brothers might have been trying to outdo their Universal counterparts in the technical gadgetry department with all those beakers and scientific looking gizmos. They even did one better on the Frankenstein operating table with one that see-sawed during the back to life process - pretty clever. The other Frankenstein connection saw Karloff's character walking through the cemetery after his last two victims using that distinctive halting gait.Fans of Boris Karloff might not consider this one of his better performances, but it still carries some punch whenever the camera closes in on his gaunt expressionless face. After all, he was dead you know. Which is kind of interesting, as this is one of those rare films where the zombie brought back to life is actually killed again before it's all over. Better not to try and explain it, just tune in for a frightfully good show.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very creative. I can understand why some might not like this film because it is not what's expected. "The Walking Dead" conjures up re-animated beings wreaking havoc and destruction until the hero's figure out how to put them back in their graves, blow them to smithereens, or send them back into, from whence they came.All Boris wants is to find out is why. But... Well, you'll have to watch the movie.It's not a monster movie and it isn't a "bring them back from the dead is evil" movie either. There's no moralizing about violating the laws of God or Man. But, it is a film about justice.The acting and directing are far better than the typical monster / horror flick of the 1930's. It's amazing what we are left to figure out on our own without being beaten over the head as in most films of the genre.Boris Karloff, who is brought back from the dead - is a sympathetic character with a unique twist.THE FOLLOWING MIGHT BE A SPOILER (I don't really think so. But, I don't know how much must be disclosed for it to be one): Boris senses who framed him and goes about finding them. He asks them "Why?" Apparently, their guilty consciences cause them - when confronted by the person whose death they caused - to be so terrified that they literally die in accidents while Boris sadly looks on because he didn't find out why they framed him. (This is only my interpretation so I'd be interested in knowing whether others saw it this way as well.) I don't remember another film where the motivation is honorable and not revenge or some other negative or "evil" motivation.Geoff</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget the likes of , Griffith , Wyler , Renoir , Lean , Godard ,Spielberg , Coppolla and Scorsese because the greatest director of the 20th Century has got to be the Hungarian born Michael Curtiz . From musicals , to epics to melodrama Curtiz could master any sort of genre though curiously I'd never seen a Curtiz horror movie until I chanced upon THE WALKING DEAD from 1936 so sat down to watch with anticipation how Curtiz would weave his movie magic in the horror genre . After seeing it however I realised that it's not in fact a horror filmDespite the casting of Karloff , a title sequence that suggests otherwise along with a misleading title THE WALKING DEAD is a revenge thriller , not a horror film . Screewriter Ewan Anderson has written a painfully contrived B movie where everyone has to do something illogical in order for the story to continue . John Ellman gets framed for murder but the witnesses don't bother to come forward until sentence is carried out which sets up a chain of implausible events . Ellman's revenge has no supernatural overtones except in the minds of those who betrayed him That said there are some fair elements to the screenplay which does point out the flaws of the death penalty . As he sits in the condemned cell Ellman laments to the warder that " You take my life and then you grant me a small favour " and the mis en scene as Ellman is walked out to the place of execution does have an impressive mood . But if you want to see a great execution scene watch ANGELS WITH DIRTY FACES or see an impressive scene involving a piano player watch CASABLANCA , both of which were directed by a certain Hungarian director</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is enjoyable escapism. Karloff is framed and dies in the electric chair even as the Governor is trying to reach the warden to stop the execution because two witnesses have finally come forward who can prove Karloff's innocence. Edmund Gwenn plays a doctor who is able to immediately bring Karloff back to life (I told you it was escapism). Throughout the remainder of the film Karloff quietly confronts the men who framed him, including his crooked attorney. The manner in which the "bad-guys" get what's coming to them makes for an interesting story. Karloff plays his character as basically a gentle, soft spoken individual who seems more interested in finding out why he was framed than in extracting revenge. My only real criticism is that the classical music selection used throughout the film is overdone and tends to get on the nerves after awhile. It's a very dreary piece to start with and not the type of music to heighten the films' enjoyment. The point was made at least twice that it was the Karloff character's favorite musical piece. I promise that, after hearing it throughout the run of this film, it will not be yours'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order to dispose of an honest judge a small group of racketeers hire a local gunman to kill him and then set up a recently released convict named "John Ellman" (Boris Karloff) to take the fall. Sure enough, John Ellman is convicted and then sent to the electric chair due in large part because of two witnesses named "Jimmy" (Warren Hull) and his girlfriend "Nancy" (Marguerite Churchill) who wait too long to come forward. Fortunately, a physician named "Dr. Beaumont" (Edmund Gwenn) comes up with a novel idea to bring John Ellman back to life even though he has been dead for several hours. Although his plan succeeds there is something much different about John which nobody can quite seem to figure out. Now rather than reveal any more of the plot and risk spoiling this movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that for a short, relatively low-budget motion picture produced in 1936 this film turned out to be quite good all things considered. I especially liked the performances of Boris Karloff and to a lesser degree that of Marguerite Churchill along with the nifty (albeit now antique) cars used in this movie. Be that as it may, I enjoyed this film and rate it as above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff Resurrected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Film starring the great Boris Karloff, directed by "Casablanca" director Michael Curtiz - Is there anything else a Classic Horror lover could desire? "The Walking Dead" of 1936 is one of a handful of Warner Horror films from the 30s, and indeed a very original one. The film, which is a mixture of gangster film (in the first half) is only 70 minutes long. Even though the entire cast deliver solid performances, this is mainly a Karloff one-man-show, simply due to this brilliant Horror icon's unique charisma and incomparable talent for eeriness. As far as I am concerned, Karloff is not only one of the all-time Horror greats, but generally one of the greatest actors in motion picture history, and "The Walking Dead" is yet another proof of this brilliant man's greatness. Apart from the great Karloff, the film is highly atmospheric and well-shot in dark eerie tones.After a gangster gets sentenced to a 10-year prison sentence, a group of fellow mobsters lead by the lawyer Nolan (Ricardo Cortez) decide to have the Judge killed. In order to prevent being charged for their crime, they frame the naive musician John Ellman (Boris Karloff) for the murder. Ellman, who had been sent to prison by the judge once, is subsequently brought to trial, sentenced to death, and executed on the electric chair. When his innocence is proved minutes after his death, Ellman is resurrected by the ingenious scientist Dr. Beaumont, who has resurrected dead animals before...The scientific resurrection of the dead is generally one of my favorite topics in Horror films. Great films about this topic have been made throughout cinematic history, be it James Whale's brilliant Universal Classics "Frankenstein" and "Bride Of Frankenstein" in the 1930s (in which Karloff plays his most famous role), the Hammer Studio's ingenious Frankenstein films with Peter Cushing, or Stuart Gordon's "Re-Animator" of 1985. These are just a few brilliant films about the (attempt of) scientific resurrection of dead people, and even though quite different, "The Walking Dead" is yet another very good film following a plot of the kind. As mentioned above, Karloff is, as always, excellent in his role. Karloff's role ingeniously switches between naive victim, human vegetable and vengeful ghost, and this great, and versatile actor was predestined to play roles of the kind. The rest of the performances are entirely solid, especially Ricardo Cortez is very good. The film is very well photographed, the dark, gloomy tones help build up a particularly eerie atmosphere. The film is neither one of Karloff's nor director Curtiz' most well known films, but it sure is worth tracking down. A must-see for fans of classic Horror!</fullReview>

Against All Odds it Delivers on all Counts. Boris Karloff, a Good Cast, and a Moody Atmosphere are all on Display.This is a Unique Movie for its Odd Take on the Resurrected and is More Spiritual Leaning than Most. Also, here the Walking Dead is a Very Sympathetic, almost Pathetic Soul Reluctantly Roaming the Earth in Search of Questions and not Out for Revenge. The Movie Looks Great and is a Class Act all the Way. With a Short Running Time it Moves at an Incredible Pace. The Scientist and His Myopia is also shown to be Less than Empathetic beneath the Surface where His Quest for the Truth is Counter Intuitive and Unethical.It is one Worth Searching Out for its Rich and Deep Undercurrents. It does have a Code-Enforced Ending that has a One-Sided, Heavy-Handed, Bible-Quoting Necessity to get a Pass and a Seal of Approval.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff rises again...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Walking Dead immediately appealed to me as I am very fond of Boris Karloff. While not one of his best films, it is rather too short and there are a couple of instances where the music overbears things a bit, it is still a very good film. Karloff himself is very commanding and poignant in his role, and Edmund Gwenn matches him beautifully. Michael Curtiz directs with a very slick and assured style, never allowing for the story to drag but not letting it rush ahead either. The expressionistic style of the cinematography adds much to the atmosphere especially in the horror elements of the story, while the score on the most part is used really well. There is also an intelligent script, and the story moves at an involving pace with the gangster elements intense and suspenseful and the horror elements scary and macabre. The idea itself may be hard to swallow initially, but it is actually dealt with plausibly and thoughtfully with not a shred of predictability.All in all, a very good film especially for Karloff. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curtiz Directs Karloff For The First And Only Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Offhand, I cannot think of another actor who gave us a more impressive run of films in the horror genre than Boris Karloff did in the 1930s. Starting with the sensation that was 1931's "Frankenstein," Boris continued to appear, year after year, in films for Universal, Columbia and (English studio) Gaumont that are now deemed eternal classics in the genre. In 1935 alone, the so-called "King of Horror" appeared in "The Black Room," "The Raven" and "Bride of Frankenstein," and his second horror film of 1936, following "The Invisible Ray," found him at a new studio, Warner Brothers. That film was "The Walking Dead," a remarkable film in many ways and yet another success for Karloff. The film's plot is one that would be adapted and only slightly reworked for several future Karloff pictures, such as "The Man They Could Not Hang" and "Before I Hang," but one that here seems fresh and winning.In the film, Uncle Boris plays the part of John Ellman, a mild-mannered pianist who, when we first encounter him, has just been released from jail after a 10-year stretch for accidental homicide. His newfound freedom is short lived, however, since a gang of high-toned racketeers has just killed a local judge and fixed it so that Ellman appears to be the guilty party. With one of the racketeers, Nolan, acting as his defense counsel, Ellman's fate is assured. He is convicted of the crime and summarily electrocuted, shortly before he is cleared by new evidence. Fortunately for him, a local scientist, Dr. Evan Beaumont, has just come up with a method of resuscitating the dead, and so the wrongfully executed man is brought back to the world of the living. But much of Ellman's memory has apparently been wiped away during his death state, he is now even more mild mannered and befuddled than before, and he sports a new and startling white streak in his bushy hair. Before long, though, the sound of a piano recalls Ellman to himself, and, by dint of some sort of supernatural agency, he somehow gains knowledge of the men who had framed him...along with an awareness of their exact locations, and an overriding desire to go after them...."The Walking Dead," however, boasts a twist that some of those other reworked films do not. Here, the Karloff character is NOT a violent man, bent on bloody vengeance. Rather, he simply wants to interrogate his framers, and ascertain why they have contrived evidence against him. It is Ellman's mere threatening presence that drives his victims to do themselves in...by falling out of a window, running into a locomotive, etc. Apparently, it was Karloff himself who insisted on this twist; the film's original script depicted him as a violent, hairy, drug-addicted alcoholic! Although some viewers might have preferred seeing Boris in all-out killer mode, his gentle but threatening demeanor here (just look at how intensely he glares at his framers, during his piano recital!) is quite effective enough. Karloff even looks like the Frankenstein monster at times...minus the neck bolts, of course! It is a wonderfully understated performance by the great English actor. And he is abetted by some other top-flight talent here, including Ricardo Cortez (the original Sam Spade, in 1931's "The Maltese Falcon") as Nolan, Edmund Gwenn (perhaps best known as Kris Kringle in 1947's "Miracle on 34th Street" and Dr. Harold Medford in 1954's "Them!") as Beaumont, and tough-guy Warner Brothers character actors Barton MacLane and Joe Sawyer as two of Ellman's "enemies." The film has been helmed with style to spare by the great Hungarian director Michael Curtiz (this was his only teaming with Karloff), whose use of odd camera angles, unsettling close-ups and striking use of light and shadow help to elevate the film to the level of screen art. Curtiz had already impressed horror fans with 1932's "Doctor X" and '33's "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (both with Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill), and would of course go on to direct such Hollywood classics as "Captain Blood," "The Adventures of Robin Hood," "The Sea Hawk" (all starring Errol Flynn), "Yankee Doodle Dandy," "Casablanca" and "Mildred Pierce." What an incredible career! He brings "The Walking Dead" home in a succinct, no-nonsense manner. The picture is remarkably concise, and at a mere 66 minutes in length, might fairly be accused of being TOO concise. (Indeed, five of the film's deaths, not to mention Ellman's ultimate fate, plus questions regarding the nature of the afterlife, are neatly shoehorned into the film's final 20 minutes!) The art of creating a short feature film such as this seems to have been lost, and indeed, it is doubtful that today's filmgoing public would be willing to pay $14 for a 66-minute entertainment anyway. Still, when done as well as Curtiz' work here, these brief pictures can be extremely satisfying affairs. Short and not so sweet, "The Walking Dead" finds its creators near the very top of their game. Like Ellman himself, it has experienced a well-deserved resurrection....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walking Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A recently released ex-con, John Ellman(Boris Karloff)is framed by a gangster crime syndicate, with corrupt ties to the city, for the murder of a judge who sentenced one of their key powerful members to a harsh prison sentence without a possibility of parole. There was a couple at the crime scene who know it wasn't Ellman behind the heinous crime..Nancy(the lovely Marguerite Churchill)and her scientist boyfriend Jimmy(Warren Hull). Nancy, in fear for their lives, keeps Jimmy from admitting Ellman's innocence, until the guilt of hiding such a fact that would keep a man from frying in the electric chair burdens her to seek assistance from the scientific genius they work for..Dr. Evan Beaumont(Edmund Gwenn). Beaumont has an insatiable desire to understand what awaits after death, and when their pleas for Ellman's attorney, Mr. Nolan(Ricardo Cortez)..who is the very ring-leader pulling the strings of the syndicate..to halt Ellman's meeting with the electric chair fail, the good scientist might just get his wish. Through advanced new experimental scientific medical techniques, Beaumont is able to revive Ellman's fried carcass back to life..Ellman has a spot on his brain that has affected memory, yet he seems somehow to know the identities of those responsible for his condition. It's as if some supernatural guiding force leads him to each individual one at a time with every member meeting a grim end.Karloff presents quite a gentle, humbled soul creating quite a sympathetic performance. The fact that he never actually lays a hand on any of the crooked racketeers..the very idea that their own guilt actually(along with a possible divine master plan from God??)causes their deaths, in a sense..only adds texture to the story, I felt. Quite a philosophical horror tale..you can see Michael Curtiz's Warner Bros. style emerging. My favorite scene is the "piano" meeting where Ellman comes face to face with those who sent him to the chair as he plays a soft ballad..Karloff's teary eyes blazing a stare of hatred that pours into his piano playing is powerful. My favorite horror film from Curtiz's early Warner Bros. career;quite underrated, I believe. I think you see the craftsman Curtiz would soon become(..if the signs weren't present with his color Atwill/Wray efforts, "Mystery of the Wax Museum" &amp; "Dr. X").</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A bit of Frankenstein here, as a doctor (Edmund Gwenn)resurrects a man (Boris Karloff) wrongfully executed. It was fun seeing Oscar winner Gwenn, who I have enjoyed many times as Santa in Miracle on 34th Street.The zombified Karloff knows the people who framed him, but he doesn't know how he knows. He is searching for answers, visiting each of the conspirators, who meet an untimely end.It is all presented as vengeance emanating from the hand of God. Karloff is excellent, and Gwenn was certainly showing the talent that would give him an Oscar later.A fascinating film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusually Religious Horror Film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose you could argue that many classic horror movies are pretty religious - Frankenstein is about a scientist who tampers with God's forbidden knowledge and pays the penalty - Dracula is awash in religious symbolism; The Exorcist is seen by many as a serious comment on Possession by Demons - Yet The Walking Dead also has this religious element...and then some! Boris Karloff plays John Elman, a former convict just out of prison for accidentally killing a man. Elman, a musician, is promptly stitched up by gangsters for the murder of the judge who sent him down, removing the judge's threat to their criminal activities. He walks the last mile to the electric chair proclaiming his innocence. However medical researcher Dr. Beaumont (Edmund Gwen) restores Karloff to life with the aid of the Lindburgh Heart, a real device from the 30s that Charles Linburgh co-designed in the hope it would lead to mechanical heart replacements.Elman has suffered a blood clot which has affected his memory, yet strangely he seems to know everything the guilty men did, and sets out to confront those responsible.And here is the crux - Karloff does not hunt these men down like some mad zombie, he merely appears to each and questions them as to their actions, and through their own fear they each die. The whole theme of the movie is the vengeance of a higher power using Elman as his agent.The movie is a watchable and atmospheric little thriller, with Karloff giving a strangely moving performance. Director Michael Curtiz, here making his third horror movie after Dr. X and Mystery Of The Wax Museum, delivers another good addition to these films. If you expect Karloff in monster mode you'll probably be disappointed, but The Walking Dead is interestingly different to the usual horror fare, and well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exceptional film that does the unexpected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I read about this film, it sounded just like another zombie movie with Boris Karloff--nothing extraordinary and a very easy to guess plot. However, I was very pleasantly surprised that instead this was more of a "thinking person's" film--more of a suspense than horror film. Now this isn't to say I dislike horror films--I just thought this one, given its title, would be amazingly predictable. But this wasn't the case at all, as it is more of a gangster film with a strange supernatural element.Karloff is set up to take a murder rap and is sentenced to the electric chair. However, two young people were able to prove he did NOT commit the crime but they came forward just as Karloff was being executed. Realizing that a mistake had been made, a scientist (Edmund Gwen) is able to revive him using some weird new process he's developed. In many ways, this whole thing is somewhat reminiscent of FRANKENSTEIN--given it's Karloff and the whole using electricity to revive the dead gimmick. But Gwen is no "mad scientist" and newspapers sing his praises and the miracle that has revived Karloff.Oddly, though, Karloff is rather "vegetable-like" much of the time and must be cared for much like you would a baby. However, there are moments of lucidity as well, when it seems as if he's possessed by a greater power. This occurs when he sees people who set him up for the murder. Although in life he had no idea who did this, somehow when he went to 'the great beyond', this knowledge was imparted to him.Now at this point, the film LOOKS like it will be a simple revenge flick. And, it IS true that the five men who set him up DO get justice, but how all this is handled is wonderful. Instead of nice-guy Karloff losing his humanity and becoming obsessed by revenge, the characters themselves seem to die mysteriously--as if God himself is then reaching down and collecting on this debt. It's all rather strange, but I really liked it because throughout the whole film, Karloff maintains his humanity and decency.The acting is very good, the direction crisp and taut and the film is an unexpectedly suspenseful and satisfying. Despite the title, this isn't a horror film. And, despite being from Warner Brothers, it isn't exactly a gangster film as well. What it is, is excellent entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because he spent so much of his career making horror films, there's a tendency to forget what a splendid actor Boris Karloff was. "The Walking Dead" is a perfect example. An innocent man condemned as a murderer, he's brought back to life by inventor Edmund Gwenn. Oddly enough, he harbors no animosity against the men who framed him. But somehow, one by one, they suffer bizarre accidents. It's wonderfully typical Karloff stuff -- made more enjoyable by his sense of wonder at how these fatal incidents keep happening. Credit director Michael Curtiz with ingenuity in setting up the deaths and Karloff's mixture of confusion and grim satisfaction at his inadvertent revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't let the other review spoilers fool you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those B movies that grade A character actors make to satisfy their own souls. Basically, a bunch of familiar faces, some with familiar names, do variations on their standard personae in service of a moral fable. Each character illustrates a moral attitude or dilemma, with their ends illustrating the logical outcome of their choices. Most get a chance to explicate their character's world view, and most seem to relish the opportunity.If you can believe one of these other reviews, Karloff's character was radically re-written at his behest, and it gives him a chance to play the Monster as himself. If you know something about Karloff's early career, or lack thereof, you can see he draws on his own experience for his character's early demeanor. First, he is an educated man suffering from bad luck and PTSD, then he has to struggle back from a traumatic brain injury. If you like watching Karloff use those big old eyes of his,this movie is for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz directed this beautifully filmed story of poor luckless John Elman(played superbly by Boris Karloff) who was framed by racketeers for the murder of a judge. Elman is then tried and found guilty of murder. Though evidence proving his innocence is found, it arrives too late to save his life. Still, a Dr. Beaumont(played by Edmund Gwenn) has developed a way to bring back the recently dead, and resurrects Elman, who resumes his pianist skills to conduct eerie concerts, though also is compelled to confront those responsible for framing him... Again, Boris Karloff is excellent, playing the role for the sympathy and pathos it deserves. Atmospheric and thoughtful; only the highly familiar plot mars this fine film, with a haunting end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SOME SPOILERS** Unusual movie with Boris Karloff that has him, playing ex-convict John Ellman, not as much as hitting much less killing anyone in it yet being responsible for the deaths of some half dozen men who framed the innocent Ellman for a murder that he didn't commit.With Steven Martin,Kenneth Harlan, having the book thrown at him for fraud and embezzlement Martin's fellow gangsters including his crooked lawyer Noland,Ricardo Cortez, plans to knock off the Judge who put him behind bars;the Honorable Roger Shaw, Joe King. In finding a perfect pasty to do the job for them Nolan and his gangster friends come up with ex-convict John Ellman who was just released from prison. Ellman was sentenced by the Judge to ten years for the murder of a person whom he claimed he killed in self-defense.Having one of the mobsters Trigger Smith, Joe Sawyer, get friendly with the unemployed Ellman he gives him a job to check up on Shaw claiming that he's cheating on his wife and that he, Trigger Smith, is a private investigator hired by her to get the goods on the judge. Murdering Judge Shaw the mobsters then plant his body in Ellman's car and that just about clinches it for them in implicating Ellman in Shaw's murder. Just one thing unexpectedly went wrong with their plan. A couple was on the scene and saw the mobsters moving Judge Shaw's body into Ellman's car. That couple just happened to be Jimmy &amp; Nancy, Warren Hall &amp; Marguerite Churchill, who work for heart transplant pioneer Dr. Even Beaumont.The sleazy Noland volunteers to take on Ellman's case, free of charge,in order to secretly undermined it and do everything he can to put the poor and innocent man into the electric chair. Jimmy and Nancy at first not wanting to get involved change their minds on the eve of Ellman's execution. They together with Dr. Beaumont get in touch with Ellman's lawyer Noland to get the governor to stop his client's execution. As you would expect Noland purposely jerks them around around letting the time run out on Ellman who's executed just moments before the prison warden gets a call from the governor to stop the pending electrocution.Dr. Beaumont getting Ellman's body from the prison morgue conducts an operation on it, that's the least he could do for him, using a new invention called the Lindberg Heart and miraculously brings the executed convict back to life. Unknown to Beaumont and everyone else Ellman is not only alive but somehow is in possession of supernatural mental and spiritual powers. It's those powers that gives him the ability to not only know what's in the hearts and minds of the men who railroaded him into the chair, Noland Trigger &amp; co, but is also able to make them pay with their lives for doing it.A very sensitive and sympathetic Boris Karloff, who's a former concert pianist in the film, together with a somewhat selfish and scheming Edmund Gwenn, make the movie "The Walking Dead" somewhat of a novelty to watch. Very moving ending sequence with Karloff, or John Ellman, facing death for the second time in the movie. This time around not at all being afraid of what he'll find on the "outer side" since he's already been there before when he was executed. Ellman now knows that death is not the end but a new beginning in one's endless journey through the vast and unexplored universe of existence. As he and the movie comes to an end Ellman tells Dr. Beaumont just before he passes away that there nothing to fear in death; it's only the gateway to a world that offers a peace and tranquility to those that enter it that they'll never find while alive and on earth.</fullReview>

The classic film is outstanding and very much worth watching.Karloff plays John Ellman - a man framed for a murder he did not commit, was electrocuted and brought back to life. Ellman seemed more interested in wanting to know why he was framed than getting revenge. The scientist, Dr. Beaumont, who brought Ellman back to life, becomes interested in what did Ellman see, learn and experience while he was dead.Very interesting movie.

		<fullReview>The Walking Dead (1936) is more of a somber drama with horror and gangster genre elements than an all-out chill fest. Still, it's worth a watch.Karloff gives the best of his unsung performances here. His melancholy and pensive characterization is perfectly mixed with a quiet menace reminiscent of his portrayal of Imhotep in the 1932 version of The Mummy.The atmosphere and cinematography are beautiful in that black-and-white 1930s horror way. So eerie and sad.Michael Curtiz's direction is good, though not as impressive as his later work would be. The other actors are adequate, but none can sustain the same interest as Karloff.Classic horror nerds will enjoy this, though it's not in the same ranks as the likes of The Black Cat (1934) or Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (1931).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Leave The Dead To Their Maker"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Boris Karloff as the Frankenstein monster in those Universal horror classics, it must have been obvious to Jack Warner and director Michael Curtiz that he was the only player capable of bringing this film off. Karloff is once again a resurrected man and said resurrection has foiled a carefully made frame that Karloff has been put in.Boris is cast as a concert pianist who has just served ten years for manslaughter. The judge who sent him up has become the target of the city's racketeers which include Barton MacLane and Karloff's own lawyer Ricardo Cortez.Here's where Karloff is under-appreciated as an actor. When you examine the frame up that is used it's really kind of stupid. But Karloff creates such an impression of this down and out pitiable figure that the real trigger man Joe Sawyer can take advantage of him and get him arrested and tried for the crime Sawyer commits.Here also is where Ricardo Cortez plays one of his patented screen heels as well. He defends Karloff once again and throws the case and then prevents two witnesses, Warren Hull and Marguerite Churchill, from coming forward to save Karloff from the electric chair. Their reasons for originally not coming forward are specious as well, but Karloff's brilliant performance smooths that all over.They work for scientist Edmund Gwenn who uses electricity and a lab that looks a whole lot like Dr. Frankenstein's to shock Karloff's cadaver back to life. He feigns amnesia and starts looking for those who did him wrong. What Karloff doesn't feign is that he has no memory of those hours that he was not among the living.As you can see a whole lot of the Warner Brothers stock company got work in this film giving Boris Karloff an unusually strong supporting cast for a change. Still Karloff carries this film and this terribly wronged man that Karloff brings to the screen will haunt you and overcomes a lot of script and editing weaknesses The Walking Dead has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Secrets of the Universe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seems almost like a "metaphysical" horror movie instead of the more limited supernatural type. Back-from-the-dead Karloff seeks to confront those who framed and got him executed on a murder charge. However, it's pretty clear he seeks no more than peaceable reproach, and that the accidents befalling the culprits as he confronts them come from an unseen hand instead of Karloff's. Ellman (Karloff) is, throughout, an innocent party who only wants to make good music, an ultimately tragic figure caught up in a strange universe.Now, there may be a cosmic sense of justice in the unseen hand that punishes those responsible for Karloff's execution. Nonetheless, I wonder where that cosmic hand was when Karloff was unjustly framed, in the first place. Perhaps, that has something to do with the "jealous god" referred to at the end. If so, the god would be better described as a fickle one.Metaphysics aside, Karloff delivers what amounts to a soulful performance, showing those traits that made even his heavily made-up Frankenstein something of a sympathetic monster. And catch that recital scene where a ghoulish-looking Karloff throws the fear of retribution into the depths of his tormentors. It's a dramatic high point. The movie itself combines Warner's trademark gangster fare with Universal's horror specialty , as one reviewer perceptively observes. Note too, the fast-moving tabloid approach to the trial proceedings, also a Warner's specialty.All in all, the movie amounts to an interesting variation on the familiar theme of the undead, made more so by Karloff's unusually sensitive performance. And that final scene that inquires into the secrets of the universe is both consistent with the movie's theme and moodily well handled. (In passing? Karloff's John Ellman is shown as a passionate devotee of classical music. Perhaps, the character was named after the Ukrainian musician Mischa Elman, then making a name for himself as a concert violinist.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After having a chance to view several Karloff movies, it's obvious he had a great deal of charm. He has a soft spoken side to him that really comes through. In this one, a group of gangsters who have a big time attorney on their sides frame him for a judge's murder. He is brought back to life by Edmund Gwynn, a scientist dabbling in things not to be dealt with, or whatever. Boris finds himself in a semi-catatonic state, slowly reviving the memory of the men who framed him in order to kill the judge. There are some really touching scenes having to do with Karloff's love of music. He also seems on a mission from somewhere beyond as he picks the five men off one at a time. I won't say any more. He does a nice acting job and is very sympathetic. Gwynn's character is driven to experiment on the man and is waylaid. At times he appears to be as guilty as the others, but never has an opportunity to carry things out. It's a decent movie with a decent message.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I rated this flick a '7' because I like the old Hollywood stuff. From that, my first real fascination was with the "Universal" monster stuff, particularly 1936 and before. With that in mind, here is my review. Quite simply, this is a Warner Brothers 'knockoff' of the Whale/Karloff Frankenstein films, with a particularly strong nod to 1935's "Bride". The entire time I was watching, including the 'scientific' scenes, I kept seeing the 'Monster'. A couple of very 'telling' things: the Karloff character removes his dentures after the re-animation sequence. There is a silver streak in his hair at the same height as the 'monsters' flat head. He is dressed in the same dark outfit, and lumbers around. The imagery is strong. While the over the top Jack Pierce make-up is absent, the lighting, etc, and the above things mentioned create a more 'human monster' visual, but it is there. Next similarity.....in the first "Frankenstein", one could be forgiven for not finding the monster altogether sympathetic. After all, despite Whale/Karloff's sympathetic presentation, the thing is a child killer. He also ends the film in murderous rage directed at Henry. However, in "Bride", there is no such ambiguity. With the exception of the first murder (Maria's father underneath the mill), we are clearly shown who the 'victim' is in the film. The film score in "Bride" is exquisite as well, a slow pulse throbbing underneath a majestic arrangement. Enough of the set-up. In "The Walking Dead", I saw the sympathetic reanimated Karloff character (looking much like the 'monster' in the shadows) lumbering around while some really bad 'know it all characters' get their comeuppance, one by one. There is a similarly soaring film score delivered over an insistent bass pulse. Where this film differs is, instead of the "Universal" staples of 'mad doctor', Una O'Conner type comic relief/character actors, you get the Warners staples. Cynical lawyers, DA's and gangsters, etc. All of that said, I enjoyed this film. I probably hadn't seen it in 35 years, if at all. All of those things that may seem like negatives, as written above? I like the Warners 'stock characters' and love the "Universal" monster stuff. I just saw all the similarities, and noted the year of 1936. This film definitely was targeting a particular audience...the "Universal Audience". Ms. Churchill even appeared in that sexy scene from "Dracula's Daughter" featuring Gloria Holden that very year. I thought Cortez did his "Warners thing" well in this flick, and Mr. Glenn was good. If you like the kind of flicks I do, you'll enjoy seeing this as a curio. Unlike some of the other reviewers, I do not see this as some type of 'forgotten classic'. Far too many plot holes. (the most famous guy in the world, being watched by everybody, seems to effortlessly disappear and reappear without anyone noticing, and in the most OBVIOUS of places). But again, for what it is (a genre knockoff), it is well directed, well filmed, and has all of the right people in all of the right places.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Walking Dead (1936) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting Warner Brothers blend of gangster, horror, and science fiction genres features Boris Karloff in a strong sympathetic performance as an innocent pianist framed for murder by a group of mobsters and their unscrupulous attorney. He is proved not guilty too late after he is sent to death in the electric chair, but is restored to life by dedicated scientist Edmund Gwenn (MIRACLE ON 34TH STREET). Weakly stumbling about like a frail reanimated corpse, Karloff still plays the piano as he is cared for by a guilt-ridden young woman (Marguerite Churchill of DRACULA'S DAUGHTER). The ghostly spectre of death with a gray streak through his hair slowly begins to remember the men who set him up, and becomes an angel of death, dealing the Wrath of God to them. Well directed by Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA). *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking Dead, The (1936) *** (out of 4) Michael Curtiz directed film about an innocent man (Boris Karloff) sentenced to death only to be brought back to life by a doctor and set out for revenge against those who framed him. The story isn't anything too original but director Curtiz and star Karloff bring it up severely levels with the strong direction and fine performance. The atmosphere of the film is quite deep and it's the most memorable thing in the film. The film does a good job at giving Karloff enough sympathy to where you want to see him get his revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wrath of God</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is very interesting to read the comments pertaining to this movie. I had the pleasure of viewing this last night and was most earnestly surprised. Many comments allude to the movie being "supernatural" but if a person has a belief in God then it is hardly supernatural. In essence, Karloff's on screen persona becomes the vengeful, wrathful arm of God, sent back to punish the wicked. Karloff's character need but face any with their guilt and their fate is sealed. It is by God's hand that he "happens" to be in places he cannot possible get to to wreak vengeance. As he observes the demise of each of those that have wronged him, you will observe he is in great emotion pain. He is driven to exact retribution, not of hid own free will. Before his death, he is recounting of what he experienced when he died in the electric chair. He mentions he felt peace and dies. The lighting on his face goes from dark to very bright. If you wish you may say he was the angel of death incarnate. I think I will view more of Karloff's films. Those that I have had the good fortune to view are a tribute to what an accomplished and versatile actor he was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowadays, if the title 'The Walking Dead' gets mentioned, one will likely think that it's in reference to the popular current TV series. But it's also the title of this interesting and absorbing combination of the horror, sci-fi, and gangster genres! It's not without a flaw here or there, but in general it's effectively atmospheric, quite snappy (it only runs an hour and six minutes), and features a mostly wonderful cast, led by the powerfully expressive Boris Karloff, who does a fine job of underplaying his part.He plays John Ellman, a pathetic sap who'd been sent up the river for murder and who makes the ideal patsy for mobsters who conspire to kill a judge. This is the same judge who'd presided over Ellmans' trial, so the mobsters correctly figure out that authorities will assume that Ellman killed the man in revenge. Two witnesses who can testify that Ellman is innocent come forward, but not in time to prevent his execution. Fortunately, they work for a scientist named Beaumont (Edmund Gwenn) who successfully brings Ellman back to life! Each of the creeps that set our hero up soon receive an eerie visit from him.Karloff is pitiable and touching, especially in a key scene where, since his death seems imminent, he requests that his favourite piece of music be played. However, the others in the cast also do some fine work, including Ricardo Cortez as slimy lawyer Nolan, Henry O'Neill as prosecuting attorney Werner, Joe Sawyer as swaggering hit-man Trigger Smith, and the always welcome Barton MacLane as Loder, the most conscience-free of the bad guys. Marguerite Churchill and Warren Hull as witnesses Nancy and Jimmy are less satisfactory.Ably directed by legendary Michael Curtiz of "Casablanca" fame, this has you rooting for the sad eyed Ellman every step of the way. While it does work as a serious story, it doesn't miss opportunities for humour by making the idea of wagering a recurring theme; there's even a minor character named "Betcha".Absolute must viewing for Karloff fans.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ex-convict John Ellman (Boris Karloff) is framed by crooked lawyer Nolan (Ricardo Cortez) and executed for a murder he didn't commit. Scientist Dr. Beaumont (Edmund Gwenn) uses electricity to bring Ellman back to life. But he doesn't come back right. He's seemingly mentally impaired yet out for revenge for those he holds responsible for what happened to him. Fantastic Karloff movie. Sort of a combo horror and gangster flick. Karloff would do many more movies with similar plots over the years but never quite this good. Part of what makes it so good is the excellent direction of Michael Curtiz. The "kills" are staged in very clever ways, implying some kind of divine justice. Also, Karloff's performance is very sympathetic and you really root for this guy because he was so badly treated by slimy Cortez. Great WB supporting cast includes Barton MacLane and Henry O'Neill. A real treat and a must-see for Karloff fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revenge after the electric chair.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the masters of the genre, Boris Karloff plays John Ellman a small time ex-con that is framed and sentenced to death for murder. Totally innocent waiting for two witnesses to clear him, Ellman is electrocuted. A scientist brings Ellman back to life. Ellman then proceeds in the demise of everyone that had a hand in his execution. Director Michael Curtiz employed his famous work with shadows and darkness. This better than average horror show from the mid '30s also starred Ricardo Cortez, Marguerite Churchill, Joe Sawyer and Warren Hull.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff on auto-pilot...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood great Michael Curtiz directs Boris Karloff in this middling thriller about an ex-con, just out prison, who is framed for a judge's murder by racketeers; after he's convicted and killed in the electric chair, a team of scientists revive him. Fatigued entry in the 1930s back-from-the-dead horror cycle doesn't allow Karloff to do anything fresh or substantial (indeed, several of his big moments seem lifted straight from "Frankenstein"!). Curtiz can't do much with this hackneyed scenario, and he's certainly not helped by the unsurprising script, though there is one strong sequence at a piano recital. Otherwise, "The Walking Dead" is D.O.A. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a very good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ultimately, this is a disappointing film. There are too many characters for a short film, all except Karloff being predictable and undeveloped. And Karloff has done better work than this. The plot is simplistic and expects the viewer to accept the idea of restoring one to life after being dead. There is a 30's flippancy in the first trial scene that is undoubtedly intended as comic relief but succeeds is doing nothing more than being intrusive. It would seem that a mood would be essential for a horror film, but there is none to be found. Yes, the camera work is more than adequate and the score is at times quite nice. However, there are too many strikes against the film. Hardly a classic, and only worth the effort if this genre of film appeals to you.</fullReview>
