		<fullReview>I only saw this movie a couple of years ago. I always avoided it at the video store because of the name, I assumed it must be about a little kid, something like The Champ or Lucas, nothing wrong with those kinds of movies, just not my cup of tea. But I happened to read about it in one of Leonard Maltins books, he called it one of the best comedies of the 70s, and very dark for it's time. So I rented it and loved it. I think it's pretty dark even by todays standards, Charles Grodins character is likeable in an odd way, but he's also two faced and deceitful, not to mention downright cruel to his new bride. I don't know of many actors that could have played this better than Charles Grodin, this was certainly his best role. In his biography he wrote that he recognizes the brilliance of the film, but he hated playing such a cruel character. The thing is, the character never intends to be cruel, he just can't seem to help it, lying and selfishness are just second nature to him. If your like me, you'll find yourself laughing and cringing at the same time. The ending is just perfection, he has seemingly attained what he wanted, the thing that he has lied and cheated and hurt other people to get, yet he seems to already be tired of it and longing for what he already had. At least that's my take on it, it's open to interpretation. This movie may not be for everybody, but if you like dark comedies, you should check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeannie Berlin is the standout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jeannie Berlin (as Grodin's wife Lila) has been sadly undermentioned in all of the comments. What a wonderful performance. She is so "out there"--watch her eat an egg-salad sandwich and then try to picture one of today's actresses willing to look so natural and vulnerable. (Well, maybe Cameron Diaz with her "hair gel" in "There's Something About Mary.") But Berlin's performance is so believable. I wish she had done more over the years.And please note the beauty of Cybill Shepherd's figure in the surf scenes. How refreshing to see something other than one of today's stick figures as the objection of desire. She is healthy, lush, and gorgeous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`The Heartbreak Kid' is a curious mix of light and dark comedy. I couldn't help thinking of `The Graduate', made four years earlier, and in many ways it was the flip-side of `The Graduate's' reflections on youthful ennui and dissatisfaction with the status quo. Charles Grodin as Lenny actually pursues the status quo, in terms of conventional standards of taste and beauty and his relentless pursuit of middle America and its acceptance. Whereas The Graduate maintained a mix of light and dark in equal measures, The Heartbreak Kid starts out as a wince-inducing comedy of manners (and mannerisms) and then slowly becomes darker as it unfolds, leaving the abandoned wife halfway through Act II, as he pursues Cybil Shephard to the frozen Midwest. The ending?well, one can only assume from Lenny's gradual separation from his new wife during the last scene and his dismal efforts to make conversation with his in-laws and newly-extended family that he'll never be more than a poseur. Even the two little kids shun him at the end. He ends up alone on the sofa humming `Close to You', which was played at his first wedding, oblivious to any sense of irony or sadness. It's pretty clear by now that he's a shallow and selfish man who can't see beyond surface blemishes (such as Lila's tics and mannerisms) and becomes infatuated with exterior sheen (Cybil Shephard's beauty and the respectability of marrying into a whitebread and wealthy goyish family). In the end, we realize that he doesn't know himself and never will. The disappearance of Lila, never to return to the story, left me a little unsatisfied, but overall I think it's worth a look, if only for the terrific scene-work of Grodin and Jeannie Berlin, and Grodin's hilarious dead-pan attempts at subterfuge.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this when it first came out in 1972 and saw it again recently on cable. One way to know a classic is how well it dates itself, not just in the vernacular, but philosophically. How timeless are the themes it portrays and how well could anyone from any time period relate to them? In fact, of The Heartbreak Kid it could be said that a lot of the shock value of a man dumping his bride on their honeymoon will be lost on a generation that would wonder why he would want to married at all. Well at least the title character believes in firm commitments, as long as it is with the right girl. The point of the whole movie is the somewhat subtle ending that depicts a man who, despite the odds against him, got the girl of his dreams, but somehow dosn't find it nearly as satisfying as he would have thought.This a terrific piece of script writing, with many memorable lines you love to quote...a sure sign of a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Unforgettable Treasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An artful mixture of deft, laugh-out-loud comedy, interspersed with touching poignant moments, makes this film special and unforgettable. Elaine May's direction was delicate yet purposeful, allowing for the superb development of characters ( in particular Eddie Albert's curmudgeonly businessman/father) without impeding the flow of the plot.In this social portrayal of the Peter Principle, the glib, shallow Lenny somehow talks himself to dizzying social and economic heights all without the benefit of a pedigree or occupational skill set. Albert's father figure takes no time at all to see through all of this; but he is outnumbered by his wife and daughter who succumb to Lenny's charms. You can't help but feel this man's helpless pain in having to watch his lovely, impressionable daughter lured into a clearly doomed marriage.Cybil Shephard, Eddie Albert and Charles Grondin all turned in career performances. This show was one of those rare times when everything (directing, writing and acting) came together to create something greater than the sum of its parts - it's a real treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The beginning of the end of personal responsibility?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems everyone loved this movie; I will offer the first dissenting opinion here. Supposedly the 1980's ushered in the "me" generation, but after watching this film, one has to wonder if it didn't begin earlier. Lenny Cathrow (Charles Grodin) has got to be one of the most selfish characters on film.He marries a nice enough gal, Lila (Jeannie Berlin, daughter of the director, Elaine May), but almost instantly shows contempt for her - "buyer's remorse"? On the third day of his honeymoon, he meets a (rich) spoiled college kid, Kelly (Cybill Shepherd), whose beauty and laugh captivate him. I should mention that Lenny and Lila are New York Jews and Kelly is a blonde mid-Westerner from Minneapolis. The fact that Lenny may never have seen a WASP like Kelly while growing up in the city is hardly an excuse for his actions, and Berlin's character is hardly a stereotypical (repugnant, overindulged) Jewish American Princess.Sure, the road-trip to Miami, during which Lenny all-too-quickly grew to hate his bride (one wonders how he ever chose to marry her in the first place), was hardly ideal. But someone who'd spent three years in the service of his country should show a little more maturity than he does; the story recalls Tennessee Williams's play, and the much better film "Period of Adjustment (1962)" - Jim Hutton's character was also ex-military. Suddenly, anything Lila does (almost nothing Lenny shouldn't have noticed while dating) is distasteful to her groom. Is it possible that he was a virgin and we're to believe that their wedding night sex was too disillusioning for him?So, Lenny decides to dump his newlywed wife to pursue Kelly, whose attraction to him is a mystery; it appears she's only toying with the young bridegroom until the incredible (and disappointing) end when he wins her away from her disapproving father (Eddie Albert, his performance being the film's only highlight). I can enjoy a movie with unredeemable characters, as long as the plot is plausible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor and Pathos at the Same Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie's a comedy, I think, though it produces as many cringes as laughs. It's hard not to laugh at poor Lila (Berlin) as she flubs her honeymoon with sunburn cr?me blotches, oozing egg sandwiches, and ill-timed bathroom breaks. But then she's so emotionally needy, it's hard not to laugh and cry at the same time. On the other hand, husband Lenny's (Grodin) got all the empathy of a ham sandwich, as he chases after blonde goddess Kelly (Shepherd), piling one absence excuse on Lila after another. This is the honeymoon from heck, especially after the goddess-struck Lenny sues for divorce. But then he does grant Lila "the luggage".The humor's in the character set-ups, and Lenny's special brand of chutzpah. A little fast- talking, he thinks, gets him out of any situation. That is, until he runs into Kelly's humorless dad (Albert). Seems like the proverbial irresistible force has run into the immovable object. But has it. Grodin's appropriately obnoxious when Lenny needs to be; Berlin's vulnerable when Lila needs to be; Shepherd's gorgeous without trying; while Albert's stony mug belongs on Mt. Rushmore. And catch that contemplative ending, not what I expected, but probably appropriate for what's gone before.All in all, the movie's something of a guilty pleasure and certainly one of a kind. I do, however, miss Grodin's smirking brand of put-on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a mystery why this film is so popular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*****This review contains spoilers***** I won't leave you in suspense: I hate this movie.I gave it three stars for the acting alone, most notably by the film's only redeeming qualities Jeannie Berlin and Eddie Albert. Cybill Shepherd is good too but mostly she just stands there looking lovely. Charles Grodin's character is so convincingly dreadful I have trouble giving him any credit because he's truly not entertaining--he's merely cringe-worthy.Basically, a sneering, snarling, sometimes sniveling little weasel named Lenny--Grodin-- marries a nice Jewish girl named Lila--Berlin-- and dumps her five days into their honeymoon for a Shiksa goddess named Kelly--Shepherd--whom he meets on Miami beach.I am not opposed to unlikable, even despicable lead characters. Lila calls him 'grouchy' but I am forced to call Lenny repulsive. This would be fine but as I said above he is not entertaining and this I cannot forgive or overlook. He literally has nothing going for him. Nada. I get this was the 70's but even then young ladies had self-respect..right? In one scene early in the film Lenny, who is aggressively trying to have sex with Lila, tells her she really means yes while she is emphatically saying no. She marries him anyway.WHY on why did a female director like Elaine May agree to make this awful, misogynistic movie? I know Lenny divorces her but why did the female director have to dump the lovably human Lila in the second act and focus on Lenny's obsessive and frankly downright creepy stalking of Kelly all the way to snow-bound Minnesota? Lila's continued presence may have helped make the second act more palatable. On top of all of the other frankly perplexing moves May and Simon pulled in this movie, Kelly agrees to marry this imbecile. Today we would recommend a restraining order, but Simon and May apparently thought it was good or entertaining, or something, to reward the jerk for basically hunting down and bagging his prey.And you thought times had changed in the film industry. I had rather the second half concerned itself with Kelly's father, played by Eddie Albert, murdering Lenny and getting away with it. I and many other viewers I'm sure would have gladly traded Lenny's presence for Mr Corcoran's. A justifiable homicide would have been a far more plausible chain of events than a girl like Kelly falling for an unattractive, self-entitled loser with no prospects, no charisma, no integrity, no discernible intelligence, and no interests beyond his own gratification. Sure, girls like Kelly have been falling for and marrying jerks like Lenny since time immemorial but usually they guy has looks, money, or personality to blind the girl to his faults. Lenny is just a flat out all-around zero. No jury in the world would have convicted Mr. Corcoran for killing the wretched stalker. Instead, if you watch this movie you must resign yourself to his presence until the literally bitter end.The underlying message of The Heartbreak Kid seems to be twofold: 1, that no matter how unworthy or unpleasant a man is he can still find multiple top notch ladies who will marry him; and 2, obnoxious, criminal aggression towards women is perfectly acceptable as long as it wins the day.What were the film makers thinking? No seriously---what were they thinking?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egg Salad Nut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Outrageous, ridiculous, annoying, seemingly made on-the-cheap, and yet one of the most endearing comedies of the 60s/70s. Such contrasts in this film! It is entirely made up of 100% stereotypes: Lenny's transparent con-man, Lila's funny/sad nebbish, Kelly's Ice Goddess, Kelly's father's WASP image, Kelly's Mother's...well...Mother image. And yet at that moment in the restaurant when Lenny breaks the news to Lila over that half-slice of pecan pie, our hearts just break for her, and Lenny's feeble, yet honest (although ultimately self-serving) attempt to comfort her also touches us, as does Kelly's joie de vivre and passion for Lenny, and her parent's obvious conflicting feelings of protection, love and knowing they have to let go. The dialogue is as delicious as that pecan pie (not to mention Lila's Egg Salad and her candy bar in bed). It is sort of a guilty pleasure. Much of the movie is of people being sort of cruel and insensitive - acting only on impulse and immediate feelings, rather than maturity. But the way the film progresses from one brilliantly written scene to another, we can't wait to see what will transpire next, and we somehow end up caring so much for everyone in the film (even though they often don't care all that much for each other!) Favorite moments: 1. the ENTIRE road trip down the East Coast as the Honeymoon starts to end before it even begins. 2. Lenny's "laying out all his cards" for Kelly's Dad (as Lenny does his monologue, and Kelly's Dad responds with his hysterical descriptions of preferring a lit bomb in his mouth rather than having Lenny court his daughter, look at the combination bemused/concerned reactions of Kelly and her Mom--priceless scene). 3. that heartbreaking restaurant scene, and Lila crying out: "Oh Lenny, you're dying!!!!" - I never saw that response from Lila coming--again, priceless! 4. The Dinner scene in Minnesota with Lenny quoting shamelessly from an editorial in the local paper. Talk about clever and unexpected dialogue! This film is an absolute gem, hasn't dated one iota, and is a genuinely bittersweet comedy guaranteed to entertain, but which also somehow manages to resonate with some very real truths about love, relationships, ego and happiness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie, more there than it might seem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that operates on more than one level, most of which is so subtle as to be nearly imperceptible --or at least seems to be imperceptible, dwarfed as everything else is by the manifest opprobrium of the main character.Superficially what we all clearly see is a dark comedy about a despicable cad, Lenny, who is not just despicable, but despicable with oblivious aplomb, a role played masterfully by Charles Grodin, the aforementioned opprobrious main character and star of the movie. That factoid right there sets up a dynamic wherein people are either going to love this movie or hate this movie, based strictly on how Lenny strikes them. Some find humor in this guy, but others do not. Many are off-put. So off-put, in fact, that they can't get past it. In that way I would compare this 1972 film to a more contemporary one, Sideways (2004). In Sideways the main characters, Jack in particular (played by Thomas Haden Church), were so personally offensive, in word, in thought, and in deed, that many people intensely disliked the movie solely on that basis. People say to me, "I hated Sideways." I ask them why and they say, "I couldn't stand Jack." Some perspective is called for here. The viewer is supposed to dislike Jack in Sideways. That was intended. Maybe find him a little entertaining --or not-- but disliking him is the intended effect. Likewise here with Lenny in The Heartbreak Kid. We are supposed to dislike Lenny. We can laugh at him too if we want to, and he is funny, but disapproval and repulsion is the intent.At the very least Lenny's actions make most people just plain awkwardly uncomfortable. The movie thereby evokes certain feelings and emotions in the viewer that aren't often evoked by movies, which, all by itself, makes this movie unique. As a work of art it makes it a success. And that's just the superficiality of it. There's more to it than just that. Bruce Jay Friedman, the writer, and Neil Simon, the director, were actually making some much deeper ethnic observations and social commentary here. Commentary about Jews, about Jews and Jewish culture in modern America, about Gentiles too, and about how Jews and Gentiles interact in that modern America. All that. But mostly the observations and commentary was about the condition of young Jewish men (some of the very same turf that was being plowed by novelist Philip Roth in about the same era as this movie was released). Lenny, the character played by Grodin, is the almost stereo-typical young angst-filled Jewish male, desperate to break out from the box of tradition which was preordained for him, and who rubbishes his very Jewish bride on their honeymoon to lust after a very Gentile blond, Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran, all as a part of that angst condition. The Corcoran family, meanwhile, presenting themselves as the cold, aloof uptight WASPs.Friedman had a lot to say here. Simon executed it well. Probably among Simon's best work, although not ever really recognized as such. A remake with Ben Stiller in the Lenny role is now in the works, soon in the offing. We'll have to see if they improve upon the original. I have my doubts that they can even come close. While not perfect, the original is a good movie. But perhaps the time for this story has passed. It was relevant, pertinent, and apropos for 1972. Not so sure about that in 2007. Not to disparage Ben Stiller, but the underlying themes of this movie wouldn't mean as much today as it did 35 years ago.Grodin and Shepherd give good performances. Eddie Albert did too. I heard Cybil say in an interview not all that long ago that she always wished they'd done a sequel to it, and that she was still open to the possibility. Very much worth seeing before one sees any remaking of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WASPs vs. Yentas</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Grodin plays a Jewish New Yorker who takes his earthy new bride to Miami for their honeymoon, but becomes increasingly disillusioned with her on the trip--most especially because of a flirty, leggy blonde from Minnesota whom he meets on the beach. With Neil Simon writing this screenplay, one is almost instantly aware not of the class issue (it doesn't matter to Simon who has more money than who) but of the Jewish angle. Simon makes the bride gross and vulgar, and Jeannie Berlin has been encouraged to play these non-attributes to the hilt, while Cybill Shepherd's Protestant sex-goddess is the epitome of sarcastic poise. Simon wins points against the new wife by playing up her Jewishness in all its stereotypical brashness; it's as if the volume is up too loud. "The Heartbreak Kid" has many things going for it--the excellent performances and some very humorous asides to name two--but the intentional lewdness behind Grodin's marital predicament, and the queasy way he ingratiates himself into Shepherd's family, isn't so much hilarious as it is cringe-inducing. Shepherd's no-nonsense father, wonderfully played in an I've-seen-everything-now way by Eddie Albert, reacts accordingly to Grodin's new proposals with anger and confusion, and in these instances the film touches on something much deeper than the modern Jewish man's internal struggle. Unfortunately, this is mainly what Simon has on his plate, and it wears the audience down--and seems very dated now, anyway. Elaine May's direction is fashionably ragged and somewhat detached, and her ending is thoughtful (if, in retrospect, uneventful). The story certainly needed a modern tweaking, as this version is just a little bit undernourished (more mean-spirited than funny), however a 2007 remake fared even worse. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grow up, Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember the "women's pictures" of the 30s and 40s, often starring Joan Crawford, Bette Davis, Barbara Stanwyck? A powerful identification element for members of the female audience aspiring to love, wealth, status, even if the leading lady, now fallen or abandoned, is left wondering whether she might have been better off before her quest.What does this have to do with "The Heatbreak Kid"? Everything! Here is a "men's picture" for our times, even though it is now nearly thirty years old. Happiness is the next woman you meet, because the one you have is not what you imagined her to be. She never will be. If Lenny, married to Lila for three days, decides he has made a mistake, the appropriate downbeat ending of this picture suggests that, on the day of his wedding to Kelly, he has reached the same conclusion.Sometimes happiness lies in being satisfied with less than the ideal. That's what you're going to end up with anyway.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing this movie when it first came out, and it always stuck with me. I rewatched it last night for the first time in decades, and I think my first impression as a teen is still pretty much my impression now. Charles Grodin plays a totally selfish person, Lenny Cantrow, who - unlike most of us - acts on every selfish impulse. He tries to kid himself into thinking he is a good unselfish person by giving his cast-off first wife all of the wedding presents and his car when the gash he's given her self esteem - telling her he wants a divorce after less than one week into a marriage and honeymoon, most of which he has spent with a Minnesota beauty on vacation (Cybil Shepherd as Kelly Corcoran) - is something that will likely never heal. Being older and a stepparent myself now, I could really relate to Eddie Albert's character, Kelly's father. He can smell Lenny's loopiness from a mile away, but how do you protect an adult daughter from a terrible fate - getting hooked up with someone like Grodin's character - that only time and wisdom can teach you to avoid. She doesn't have that wisdom yet.I always thought the second wedding scene sharing so many similarities with the first is basically saying that Lenny is going to go through life ruining other people's lives because he wants what he wants when he wants it, and worse, he will always convince himself he is not a bad guy when he walks all over people to get what he wants. Also you see just a smidgen of regret in his face after the ceremony as he talks in circles about his career plans to any wedding guest that will listen, suggesting that perhaps catching Kelly is not as satisfying as chasing her all of these months has been.Finally, I just have to tip my hat to director Elaine May. Somehow, in both 1971's "A New Leaf" and this film, she really knows how to make a female character annoying right down to the tone of voice and physical movements. She did it with her own character in A New Leaf and then did it with her own daughter, Jeannie Berlin, in this film as Lenny's first wife, Lila. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's no insincerity in those potatoes. There's no deceit in the cauliflower.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost from the onset we can tell that Lenny and Lila are not meant to be. An early shot reveals that perhaps it was only the promise of sex that made Lenny agree to the marriage. On day one of the honeymoon period, they are happily bellowing The Carpenters from their car and cheering about Miami Beach. By day two they are practically screaming and yelling at each other. Jeannie Berlin plays the dopey, overexcited bride; they have just tied the knot and she is already preparing for their golden oldies, and he's tilting his head around the corner, looking back on what he left behind. May taps into a Jewish type homeliness that Berlin immediately takes on board. Watch Lila devour an egg-salad sandwich without the least bit of concern about her appearance, and see Lenny cringe on the spot and re-evaluate his whole life. His new wife is pretty, though a little big-nosed, and can't hold a candle to the angelic WASP beauty that approaches him during their honeymoon. Just compare them physically, which is what Lenny does right away. She is a young Cybill Shephard, who seems to descend down from the heavens themselves into Lenny's eyeline. Because his wife is lying in their hotel like a wrinkly bright red prune, he is immediately taken to her like a teenager who catches a pretty schoolgirl's eye is. Every word out of Kelly's mouth is the gospel, her laugh is like a newborn baby's first. And all the while he is rushing into the room and rushing out half dressed, spinning another unlikely story to Lila. Grodin has the uncanny ability to seem so sincere, so self-righteous. He is an early Woody Allen prototype, so when he is accused of something he rightly knows he is guilty of, he explodes defensively, getting mightily offended that she would even suggest such a thing. He does the same thing in perhaps the funniest scene in the film, where he tentatively breaks the news of divorce to his wife of five days. If she would have a little pecan pie before the bad news she will be okay, Lenny thinks, so he is furious when the restaurant has run out. Without even thinking, he frames the talk as though it is he that is making the sacrifice here, setting her free so she can chase her dreams or whatnot. Lila is of course too naive, too innocent, which forces the excruciating words out of Lenny's mouth. So while the poor girl is basically hyperventilating, he has already swept clean his conscience and moved on, thinking himself having done the right thing. Ah, the pecan pie arrives just in time for the sobbing ex-wife, a piece of brilliant comedic timing. "You gonna eat the pie? You want a little piece of pie?" prods Lenny, as if dessert will solve everything. The film is mightily funny because Grodin plays Lenny completely and unrelentingly straight. He believes sincerely in every phony and god-given word that comes out of his mouth, and has a determination only matched by his stupidity. We sense that Kelly is used to dangling men on her arm; she has a whole posse around her everywhere she prances in college, and can even persuade her father to do things he would never dream of doing. Before Lenny she has never been approached and propositioned by someone so straightforward, so without shame. Only by sheer persistence can he replicate the same fling from the sun-kissed Miami beaches to snowy Minnesota.The genius of Grodin's performance is that he does not see himself as doing any wrong, and this gives him the false confidence to wreak havoc no matter where he goes. When a schoolgirl smiles at those sideburns and teddy-bear locks of his, he gives a stupid, adolescent grin like Christmas has come early. And when he sees her naked for the first time, he blurts out a teenager's line. Lenny has the ability to say the most outrageous things with a straight face; "There's no lying in that beef," and so on. This is reminiscent of Chance the gardener in Being There, whose metaphoric life advice gave a wholesome country food for the soul. Mr Corcoran, the most sensible character here, sees right through him, and so do we, but because he is a teenager in love, he will go to the ends of the earth and then some to get want he wants. So we smash cut hilariously to the wedding, where an ecstatic Lenny has just gotten his gift. He wanders around, engages in some small talk, and then is left alone once again. His first marriage lasted all of five days, and now this one is already boring him during the ceremony! At times the actions of Lenny are cringe worthy, and it is hard to watch, but how engaging is it to see how far he can take it all. The film painfully and humorously reveals the depths that sheer will can take us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I finally watched The Heartbreak Kid on YouTube. I enjoyed it immensely!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, all I knew of this movie was who was involved in it: director Elaine May, screenwriter Neil Simon, author Bruce Jay Friedman (I was previously familiar with two of his '80s comedies I remember enjoying-Stir Crazy and Splash) and stars Charles Grodin, Cybill Shepherd, and Eddie Albert. Oh, and also another player-Jeannie Berlin-is Ms. May's daughter. I also knew of the premise-Grodin marries Ms. Berlin, finds out she's not very appealing, dumps her after meeting Ms. Shepherd during their honeymoon, tries to get Ms. Shepherd's father-played by Albert-to approve of him for her and then...Well, I'll just say that this was both funny and a little painful to watch but it was mostly quite an enjoyable one to finally see for myself just how well put this was. So on that note, I highly recommend The Heartbreak Kid. Oh, and I just remembered that Audra Lindley-years before playing Helen Roper in "Three's Company"-is in this, too! Also, Doris Roberts-a couple of decades before her Emmy-wining role in "Everybody Loves Raymond"-plays Grodin's mother during the first-wedding sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>man meets woman on honeymoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love Elaine May! She wrote this odd one from 1972. So many big names in here. Lenny ( Charles Grodin) and Lila (Jeannie Berlin... Elaine's daughter) get married right at the beginning, and it all falls apart from there. Did you notice Doris Roberts as one of the wedding guests? She had JUST played a pretty big role in May's big hit "New Leaf". The happy couple bicker the first night of the honeymoon, which is normal, but then things take a turn for the worse. The "other woman" is Cybill Shepherd, whose parentals are Eddie Albert (Oliver!) and Audra Lindley (Mrs. Roper!) What a big, plastic, beach bucket of stars. Eddie Albert had been in the movies for years, but this was an early role for most of the rest of the cast. Turner Classics has this listed as a "COMEDY", but its a pretty serious drama.Apparently Neil Simon worked on the screenplay, but you won't find the kind of humor that he put into "Seems Like Old Times" or "Murder by Death". Well done, but it definitely should NOT be listed as a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers On A Beach.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was written by Neil Simon but is more loose-limbed and subtle than most of his other work. It was directed efficiently by Elaine May and her daughter, Jeanne Berlin, has a prominent role as Charles Grodin's bride. They are in ecstasy, dancing to the tunes of Burt Bacharach. Both are bourgeois but differences soon emerge when they take off for their honeymoon in Miami. She pulls down her bodice and playfully bares her boobs to him while he's trying to drive on the crowded interstate. "STOP it, the TRUCK drivers will see!" She sulks a little.This is clearly Neil Simon territory, two slightly mismatched people, as in "The Odd Couple," only with far more nuance, as it develops.Grodin is conventionally handsome and young, while Berlin has more interesting characteristics. She's plumper than usual (too many Milky Ways) and she has strong, fleshy, attractive features. She is matronly towards Grodin and loving, too. Her voice is so nasal that it might make a good, irritating whine, but she speaks so slowly and mellifluously that her tone is endearing.The morning after their first night as a couple, they have breakfast in the attached motel restaurant. He eats his hamburger delicately, like a surgeon. She orders a double egg salad sandwich and a chocolate shake and smears everything all over her lips while Grodin stares aghast. "Want a bite?", she asks, offering him the half-eaten sandwich. And, "Leonard, look around. There's us in fifty years, isn't it?" Grodin looks over his shoulder to see a wizened, stooped old man trying to help his gnome-like wife into her coat. It's already funny and it's hardly begun. The film turns her into a repellent figure, covers her bright red body with cold cream and odium.Maybe it should have stuck with that one relationship -- Grodin and Berlin -- because half way through, Grodin falls for. Cybil Shepherd, the summum bonum of femininity, full of confidence, cute little quirks, and stunning. She's rich, she's beautiful, she's flirtatious, she has a perfect figure, she's indifferent, and she's a shiksa named Kelly. He bumps into her on the beach. You ought to see Miami Beach in the winter -- hardly a soul who isn't eligible for membership in AARP, wobbling stiffly about, retired, gray-haired, wrinkled, flabby, and brown. No kids. I take the caricature to be deliberate, another reminder of what Grodin and Berlin will be like in "forty or fifty years." Now the story takes us from Grodin feeling superior to Berlin, to Shepherd's Aryan Minnesota family and their goyim naches. Now HE gets to feel demeaned. The story is like a sandwich with a double filling of egg-salad humiliation and, while it's funny, it sort of disjoints the whole movie.The head of Kelly Corcoran's family is the very rich and anti-Semitic Eddie Albert, who is obnoxious throughout. But one of his friends is William Prince (the pharmacist's mate in "Destination Tokyo") whom I've always like because he and I share the same alma mater. Grodin dumps Berlin, gives her everything, and heads after Shepherd to Minneapolis, where he visits Kelly's house and her father threatens to kill him if he ever shows up again. Worse, Shepherd has almost forgotten him and now has no time for him because she's late for an English Lit class. The flirtation in Florida that she's laughed off, Grodin took seriously. It's like Bruno and Guy in Hitchcock's "Strangers on a Train." Shepherd, quite unconvincingly, changes her attitude after a brief conversation. At their marriage reception, Grodin finds himself talking to wealthy businessmen who manufacture tear gas. He's polite but not interested. Finally, he's isolated on a couch with only two ten-year olds listening to him before they too leave, out of boredom. Grodin sits alone, humming Burt Bacharach to himself, and we have little idea of where this is all headed. He's young, resourceful, and innovative, but alternately determined and then so impulsive we can doubt that he has functioning frontal lobes. Or he could go mad and start screaming at any moment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heartbreak Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the Ben Stiller remake of this film before this original version, and I found out this original was in the book of 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, so I had to see whether it deserved that inclusion. Basically Jewish New York sporting goods salesman Lenny Cantrow (Golden Globe nominated Charles Grodin) has just got married to fellow Jewish New Yorker Lila Kolodny (Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Jeannie Berlin), and they setting off for a three day honeymoon in Miami. On the journey and arriving at the Doral Hotel on the beach he is becoming bothered by the smallest or most annoying aspects about his new wife, making him question whether it was mistake to marry her, so he makes numerous excuses to get away from her. Lenny thinks his marriage was a bad decision even more when he meets vacationing witty and gorgeous student Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd), so he makes even more excuses to Lila to spend time with this young woman. Eventually however he confesses to his wife that he does not want to be married anymore due to both this new love interest and because he has become impatient with her, it is unclear whether his new girl feels the same way but he is really keen to marry her following a divorce. Returning home and having divorced Kelly he knows that Lila is attending college in Minnesota, he knows that if he is going to go any further with her he should meet her parents, and he does not make a good impression with her overly protective and hostile father Mr. Corcoran (Oscar nominated Eddie Albert). It is an obstacle convincing the father to think well of him, but eventually Lenny is accepted by the family and he is allowed to marry Kelly, and this time it is really a happy wedding for him and her equally. Also starring Audra Lindley as Mrs. Corcoran, William Prince as Colorado Man, Augusta Dabney as Colorado Woman, Mitchell Jason as Cousin Ralph, Art Metrano as Entertainer, Marilyn Putnam as Mrs. Kolodny, Jack Hausman as Mr. Kolodny and Doris Roberts as Mrs. Cantrow. Grodin is reasonably good fun as the easily irritated newlywed husband, Berlin is funny constantly being needy and annoying, Shepherd is nice enough as the new love interest, and from what I remember Albert is fine as the bigoted father of the new love interest. The story does not have a build up before the wedding, there is not much slapstick, it seems a bit more serious, and there were some nice love story moments, I will be honest and say that I preferred the remake, but I supposed I can see it as a near must see romantic drama. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. It was number 91 on 100 Years, 100 Laughs. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The Company Of Lenny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Grodin's Character of Lenny in "The Heartbreak Kid" is one of the most peculiar characters you'll likely encounter on film. Despicable, outrageous and an audacious liar. He's obnoxious in his determination to get what he thinks he wants and yet somehow comes across as sincere and likable. This whole film is also one of the most peculiar comedies to come along. I found myself alternating between laughs and uncomfortable winces at his utter insensitivity and selfish determination, but it's this dichotomy of emotions that make The Heartbreak Kid the obscure gem that it is. I don't think we can ever be sure if we should like or hate this guy. Two scenes in this movie: "laying his cards on the table" over drinks with Kelly and her parents and the breakup scene in the restaurant with Lila, are a sight to behold. Eddie Albert's, Jeannie Berlin's and Cybill Shepherd's facial expressions are priceless as they listen to Lenny's plans to claim Kelly after remedying his current "complication". The scene in the restaurant as Lenny tries to "drop the bomb" on Lila would be funny if it wasn't so painful to watch. I've never been quite sure about the final scene of this movie: Lenny on the couch, quietly humming to himself, seemingly at a loss as the camera lingers on him for a thoughtful moment, is he already on his way to becoming dissatisfied again now that he has attained his desire or has he finally found some peace after his battle for Kelly? This is an unusual comedy well worth a look. If you can find it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lenny Cantrow (Charles Grodin) has married his NY Jewish princess Lila (Jeannie Berlin). They are driving to honeymoon in Miami beach. He starts to get annoyed by little things that Lila does. At the beach, he encounters the flirty Kelly Corcoran (Cybill Shepherd). He starts spending more and more time with her even after her father (Eddie Albert) moves out of the hotel to get away from the Jewish element. He starts lying to Lila to spend more time with Kelly. He divorces Lila to follow Kelly in Minnesota.Elaine May is probably a better writer than a film director. She lacks a visual style and a cinematic sense of comedy. The theater is probably a better place for her than the big screen. Although she gets a good performance from Grodin. The Neil Simon script is a terrific skewering of the racial divide and Lenny is a terrific squirrelly protagonist. There are no big laughs but the movie has a great dark twisted humor about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly an amazing movie, comic and tragic at the same time. How masterful the screenplay, the scenes, the characters. One actually cannot even predict how the movie is going to end until the very last scene. The main character played by brilliant Charles Grodin is the most intriguing and interesting character I have ever seen in the movies. One is not sure whether to love or hate this guy. He does the most despicable things and yet somehow is likable all through the movie. I actually did not realize he was just a masterful liar until 10 min before the end as he is quoting that morning s newspapers as something he has come up with on his own...or when he praises the food using some nonsense exaggerated compliments, or when he talks to people about his future business plans and fascination with "soil and going back to basics" only to end up talking about his admiration for "insurance business" 5 minutes later. I think he manages to deceive everyone because he is first of all deceived and confused himself. He is a man of contradiction, seemingly positive, determined and knowing what he wants only to discover a confused and unsatisfied, lost in every sense of the word, sad person. I think the character is actually developing and changing in front of our eyes until we discover in the last scene a very different Lenny from the one we were expecting to find. Truly a gem of the cinematography. Well worth watching! I found it on youtube...:) full movie. Enjoy!</fullReview>

But in this movie Lenny is not at all a sympathetic character while his wife certainly is. There are some really intense scenes in this movie. Sometimes uncomfortably so. I guess this was one of the first "Dramedy" movies before that term was even invented.Anyway, there is one classic scene in this film that's absolutely worth the price of admission. Eddie Albert earns his Oscar nomination without saying a single word, doing the Slow Burn to end all Slow Burns, while Lenny "lays his cards on the table".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>whew, bad writing, bad acting, bad filming...and not funny!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid (1972)Okay, it's a comedy. And humor is idiosyncratic. But so much of this movie swings around the supposed (sarcastic?) appeal of the lead male, TV actor Charles Grodin, who is a definitive dweeb, it's hard to really get into it. And hard to laugh at. Because if you don't get the joke, it just comes off as dumb.Maybe there are people who identify specifically with these types, back around 1970, who can also feel how funny and warm it might be. The lead females are contrasting types, of course, the Nordic Cybil Shepard and the Jewish Jeannie Berlin, but both are beautiful and fun and charming in the way a movie needs them to be (Shepard is actually a little dull). It's not such a contrast or such a game, after all, and we are stuck watching Grodin, with a little lame Dustin Hoffman in him, bounce between the two women. Not only is he a lame actor, his character is a jerk, too. What's most baffling is that the writer is Neil Simon, and though he's had some bombs, he's clever and funny regardless. Something went wrong, and the best guess is Elaine May, who is famous for the notorious "Isthar" that also has a wacky, not so funny sense of humor (and stars the real Dustin Hoffman). But her Mikey and Nicky isn't as bad, and she has worked for years with the great Mike Nichols.Anyway, take it where you can. It's poor sledding all the way, badly filmed, interminably banal, and dated to boot. Good luck!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While on honeymoon with his nice Jewish bride, an indecisive young man meets the woman of his dreams. May elicits good performances and keeps it entertaining but the script is not one of Simon's best. Grodin is terrific as the schmuck who sees an opportunity to go for the gold in the form of WASP beauty Shepherd. Berlin (daughter of May) steals the film as the jilted wife, a loving if not lovely woman that one wants to give a reassuring hug to. The scene where Grodin dumps her is indeed heartbreaking. Albert is funny as Shepherd's stern father, who eventually tries to buy off Grodin. This film has parallels to "The Graduate," although it is nowhere as good as that classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Priceless. Charles Grodin is in every scene of THE HEARTBREAK KID and in every scene his actions are more cringe-inducing than the last. Insinuating himself into the lives of a mid-western WASP family, Grodin is sickening...utterly insincere and constantly losing. He's head over heels for wholesome coed Cybill Shepherd, much to the constant dismay of her stern father Eddie Albert. Further complicating matters is his new wife! Grodin, in an early leading role, is excellent, Shepherd is charming and Albert steals each scene he's in...his teeth never seem to unclench. Another big plus is Jeannie Berlin as Grodin's hapless bride, a woman with the social graces of a blind hippo. Directed by the great Elaine May and written by Neil Simon. It's funny and smart. Adapting the Bruce J Friedman story, this is probably the most cerebral thing Neil Simon has ever written.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Lenny fell in love - on his honeymoon!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Grodin strangely never seems to have attained stardom despite having given a number of excellent performances, such as the one in this film. 'The Heartbreak Kid' ( 1972 ) casts him as 'Lenny Cantrow', an ex-army man who falls for and marries over-affectionate Jewish girl Lila ( Jeannie Berlin ). On their Miami honeymoon, she comes to irritate him. Asking him whether he loves her at every opportunity, and making a a pig of herself by eating egg salad in a restaurant.When she gets a bad case of sunburn, he leaves her in their room while he goes to the beach alone. Here he meets beautiful college student 'Kelly Corcoran' ( Cybill Shepherd ). They get friendly, and he gradually realises he made a big mistake marrying Lila. After a quickie divorce, he goes off in search of Kelly. But there is an obstacle in his way - her cantankerous ( and rich ) father Dwayne ( Edward Albert )...This is a wonderfully witty comedy, superbly directed by Elaine May ( also responsible for the 1971 Walter Matthau film - in which she also acted - 'A New Leaf' ). The performances are uniformly excellent, particularly Grodin and Berlin ( okay, so she's May's daughter, but so what? Why has she not had as good an acting role as this since? ), and Albert is suitably fearsome as Kelly''s dad ( if this had been made thirty years before the role probably would have been played by Spencer Tracy ). He gets most of the best lines. On hearing Lenny's pretentious comments about dinner, for instance, he remarks: "No deceit in the cauliflower? Where do you get ideas like that?". It should come as no surprise that this is the work of the great Neil Simon. He has sometimes come a cropper writing directly for the big screen ( 'The Cheap Detective', for instance ), but his work here is top-notch. Shepherd looks good enough to eat as 'Kelly'. The ambiguous ending suggests that Lenny is more interested in the chase than in the ( for wont of a better word ) kill. Perhaps he and Kelly broke up after only a few months of married life, and he went after some other girl.Funniest moment - Lenny and Lila are in a restaurant. He is trying in a roundabout way to tell Lila that he wants out of the marriage. She misunderstands, and thinks he is dying!</fullReview>

But still, what he does is wrong.Leaving his wife, his beautiful and sweet wife like that is just wrong.But in the last image of the film you can see some kind of regret on the man's face.He's just married Kelly and he starts humming Close To You, that was played on his wedding with Lila.This movie made me laugh several times.Like the time Lenny lays out all his cards for Kelly's dad wanting to marry his daughter.Guess twice how the old man feels about that.The Heartbreak Kid is a real treat.Everybody should see it.</fullReview>

A guy 3 days into his honeymoon meets the girl of his dreams. The guy is played by Charles Grodin and the girl is played by Cybil Sheppard who looks absolutely stunning. The main comedy in the movie comes from Grodin's absurd lies or brutal honesty. The first half probably has the best humor but I thought the ending was interesting.

		<fullReview>If I could I would score this film 6.5 out of 10, but I can't so I gave it a 7 to be nice. For me a 5 is watchable and anything lower than 5 is negative. I quite liked this film whilst watching it, but can see some of the flaws others have mentioned.This film did make me smile a number of times: - The relentless lies and the unnerving way in which they were told. I didn't find the behaviour callous, I don't think it was being presented that way, and the personality of Lyla is so irritating that I could easily understand why the newly-wed groom capitalised on the opportunity to escape her. As such I did find that part of the film quite humorous.- There are one or two great lines for the lead character, particularly the card-laying scene and the manner in which he describes his appreciation of the meal at Kelly's parents.- Cybil Shepherd is just beautiful. The sort of beauty that makes me smile uncontrollably just looking at her. Beautiful in a way that made an instant and lasting impact on me and will be the primary memory I will take away from this film. I've only ever seen her in the 1990's sitcom 'Cybil' before watching this film and now don't know whether to seek out the rest of her work or not - I don't want to spoil the image I have of her from this film.- The final scene. Listening to Lenny repeat ad infinitum his baseless rhetoric about wanting to put back into the country, finally ending up unloading it on a couple of kids, and neither of them buy it either. It rather reminded me of myself and my fruitless search for some sort of sense of purpose in the employment I have had, not knowing what sort of job I wanted but knowing deep down that whatever it was it probably doesn't exist anyway, and then boring other people about it at parties. I don't know if this was meant to be about Lenny's lack of satisfying employment or a metaphor for his search for the right woman - I'll have to watch it again and pay particular attention to the beginning of the film to see if his employment is a theme or not. It's only touched on lightly in the main content of the film so I'm not sure. But either way the scene makes me smile in a melancholic way. I do like dark humour.The main flaw in the film to me is that Lenny does not seem the type of male that would win the affections of Kelly. She is obviously 'well-bred' and I can't see what Lenny offers her other than a play-thing for the duration of her Florida holiday, but he's not rich, especially good-looking or even likable. So why she ever ends up marrying him I don't know. It comes so close to the end of the film that I can only figure it was a deliberate contrivance to make the point about Lenny's character in the most efficient way.Overall though a likable film that I will try to see again to see if I can figure out some of the finer points. Definitely better than the 2007 remake. I must admit here that I don't like Ben Stiller in most of the films I've seen him in, which introduces bias, but I can't remember coming away from watching that one thinking anything good about it apart from the fact I think the last word in the script is c***s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbroke but not over this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>****************WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS***************This is a wonderful comedy, written by Neil Simon from a story by Bruce Jay Friedman and directed by Elaine May, the former partner in comedy to Mike Nichols, It's one of Cybil Shepherd's first movie parts and also stars Elaine May's daughter (Jeannie Berlin) in a role that is not glamorous and makes a convincing case that there was no nepotism involved in the casting of this movie. Charles Grodin plays an extremely foolish Jewish man from New York who marries a Jewish girl merely out of convenience( Jeannie Berlin). On their honeymoon his wife becomes incommoded and is left to fend for herself whilst Lenny falls into lust with a young, sexy WASP he meets on the beach, who he describes in his own mind as his 'ideal' woman. Kelly (Cybil Shepherd) is, on the face of it, attractive on the outside, but perhaps a little lacking in other attributes such as intellect or character. Lenny meets her parents to inform them of his feelings for their daughter, but her rich father is not impressed.'The Hearbreak Kid' can best be described as a 'comedy of embarrassment' both for the characters and the audience. This film is an hilarious example of how much funnier it is to laugh 'at' people instead of 'with' them and that's why the audience is embarrassed by watching this film. Lenny from the start is portrayed by Grodin as nothing more than a naive, grasping, horny young fool; Kelly is selfish, grasping, and unaware of anything going on outside of her own tiny universe. Her parents are cardboard cut-outs without any kind of character or judgment. As played by Eddie Albert, Kelly's father is a dangerous buffoon even more out of control than Lenny and when Lenny and Kelly finally do get together they are both sorely disappointed with the result.I am far too young to appreciate the past glories of the Nichols and May comedy team who were such a success in the U.S. in the 50's. I can only tell you that judging from this film, Elaine May has a marvellous eye for the foibles of people and manages to turn satire into something with a deeper meaning to it. It seems as though we are all little people as judged by the universe, with very little hope or opportunity to attain something that may be greater than ourselves. There is nobody in this film who appears to be very bright, so you could say that it's a case of equal opportunity silliness, with nobody intentionally singled out. It's a film that does not confirm one's faith in other people and it's a daring ride to have the carpet tugged out from underfoot by the comic unpredicability of the plot and character. Since I am probably one of the few persistent souls who made the effort to rescue this title from the obscurity to which it has been consigned, I can't imagine that it's to be released anywhere or anytime in any zone in the near future and I find this prospect disappointing. That this film has been so criminally overlooked is a mystery to me and it gives me a great amount of pleasure to give it the highest recommendation that I can without looking foolish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern Day W.C. Fields?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Charles Grodin and Cybill Shepherd star in this off beat comedy that ends up being more dramatic and poetic than funny. Charles Grodin has always been on the border line when it comes to being funny and serious. Much of his comedy career has been played serious and his dramatic appeal is sometimes hilarious. Unlike Chaplin, Keaton or the Marx Brothers, Grodin's punchline is not necessarily funny. Most of the times, the outcome of the joke / hilarious situation turns into a political / ethical realization. Grodin's character is likable but by the end of the movie you either lose total interest in the character or you become so attached to him that you feel bad during the final frame of the story. In many ways, Grodin resembles a young W.C. Fields character where you hope for his achievement in the relationship with Cybill Shepherd and his family. Then again, Grodin puts himself into situations where he is the butt of the joke and the victim of the circumstance. A wonderful movie, made before its time. The Heartbreak Kid is a story about a middle aged kid (much like Fields) who is in need of getting his heart broke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lenny, the eternal hunter - a brilliant caricature of human "malekind"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film, the story, and especially Elaine May's fingerprint is brilliant. The movie starts right after he has brought down his first prey. An obvious mistake. She fails in all ways, and you sit and wonder why he chose her. Next he meets the absolute opposite prey: Beautiful, gorgeous, cultured, rich, and the chase begins... After he has brought down the prey, the movie ends with Lenny's new challenge. Lenny is the hunter. He will never settle, always on the road. A brilliant caricature of some human "malekind".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epitome of a Romantic Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No pecan pie?? No pecan pie?!? This movie, although a long forgotten classic to the trendy, so called "movie buffs" out there, blissfully unveils the solid foundations of a perfect romance comedy. though made in 1972, the subtle and sometimes blatant humor, and the addition of an ex bachelor suffering from a regretful commitment, truly creates a more real relationship dilemma that seems to be missing in more modern chick flicks.The Heartbreak Kid truly is a lost gem; forged with superb casting, many memorable scenes, and a handful of classic dialogues and mannerisms that will certainly become engraved in memory with intricate ease.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wonderful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although fairly unknown, this is a classic film - period. I watched it for the first time the other night and it has jumped right to my "Top 10" movies of all time. That in itself is saying something.The plot of the film involves a sports salesman named Lenny (played by Charles Grodin, in arguably his finest performance) who rushes into marriage to the first girl he meets in a singles bar. From there, the pair whisk off to Miami Beach for their honeymoon. During the long trip from their native New York, it becomes apparent to Lenny that he has made a monumental mistake.On the newlyweds first day in Miami, Lenny's wife, Lila, ignores his plights for her to put on some sunscreen. In turn, she develops a severe cash of sunburn which forces her to stay inside the hotel room, while a joyous Lenny is free to pursue other things - like courting the beautiful and seductive Kelly (played by Cybill Shepard).This is a poignant, bittersweet film that will have you laughing, crying, and even squirming.The soundtrack is a plus, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreak is A Funny Kid ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Albert's 2nd nomination for best supporting actor in the 1972 film, "The Heartbreak Kid."One can ask how can a picture be good when its hero, played by Charles Grodin, marries Jeannie Berlin in a Jewish ceremony at the beginning of the film, and by the latter's end, he is marrying Cybil Shepherd in church. Oy vey!Yet it happens. On his honeymoon with Berlin, he is taken back by the lovely Shepherd, love here is the obstacle. What is he to do with Berlin? Murder, is not legal we know.If that isn't enough, he runs up against Shepherd's father, played with a fine demeanor by Eddie Albert, who conveys the typical WASP feeling. How can this average Jewish guy win over a man, a typical WASP? This becomes the central theme. While Grodin was good in the film, anyone ever wonder what Dustin Hoffman would have done for the part of Lenny?Jeannie Berlin was nominated for best supporting actress. Just look at her face filled with cream to cover that sun-burn that keeps her locked up in the room while Grodin cavorts with his love.A comic look at some very serious issues. Well worth the look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>43. THE HEARTBREAK KID (comedy, 1972) Lenny (Charles Grodin) a young Jewish man, marries seemingly perfect-match Linda. On their way to their honeymoon in Miami Lenny realizes that Linda's various idiosyncrasies are driving him crazy. In Miami he meets Kelly (Cybill Sheperd) a young-WASP beauty whose lustful innuendos he falls under. After 2 days of courting her he decides to leave Lina. He follows Kelly to Minnesota where he plans to marry her. However, Kelly's rich, snobbish parents object. But he shamelessly fights for Kelly's hand in marriage.Critique: Extremely funny, satirical film adapted by Neil Simon and directed by Elaine May. It is Charles Grodin's best outing, proving that once he could act and have a comic touch (his persona has become strangely wooden). Lenny is the ultimate, unthinkable 'schmuck' who cons his way into any situation. The fun of the film relies on Lenny's unnerving pursuit of Kelly, and how his ridiculous lies and deceit work to his favor. Trying to pass himself as an honest, likable fella, we are astonished that Kelly even likes him. Thinking that 'honesty is the best policy', he repeatedly infuriates those around him. Despite all this, we can relate to this guy. Maybe because at one time or another we have sunk as low when in pursuit of someone we lust after. At the end, we do come to understand Kelly's equal fascination with him. After all, the never-say-die attitude sometimes pays off.QUOTE: Lenny: "You were very attracted to me. You were? . . That's cute, that's a really cute thing. So I was. . .something to do?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why, Neil Simon? Why?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Neil Simon. I have read the entire "Collected Plays of Neil Simon Volume 1." "The Odd Couple" is one of my favorite movies, and I also loved "The Odd Couple 2", "Brighton Beach Memoirs", and "Barefoot in the Park."I know Neil Simon. And Neil Simon can do much better than this.The plot is overused. How many other movies make a man decide between two women? In this particular version of the plot, you can predict everything that happens in the movie from the IMDB Plot Summary. There are no surprises here.And let me say this: IF ANY OF YOU OUT THERE EVER WRITE A MOVIE, DO NOT END IT LIKE THIS MOVIE ENDS.There are a few funny scenes, and the acting isn't bad, but the plot is just stupid. Feel free to rent "The Heartbreak Kid" if you don't want to listen to me, but I wouldn't recommend buying it before you see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Students who have attended the University of Minnesota will recognize the mall section of the campus. They will also realize that 1) Lenny is parked in an area where that is a pedestrian only walk way, and 2) Kelly walks over the bridge from Coffman Union (an area where there are no classrooms) after she has supposedly returned from class.An enjoyable film, although viewers might grow tired of Lenny's continual run of fables about himself, and I don't think many people will buy his fascination with the empty-headed Kelly.</fullReview>
