		<shortDescription>It's no "Something about Mary"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The horrible crude scenes leave a bad taste and overshadow any funny scenes. I think the Farrelly Brothers wanted to recapture the success of "There's Something About Mary" -- but they've flopped hard.The universe of "Mary" was completely wacky and any naughty parts just fit into that universe. This one feels like there were too many screenwriters tinkering with it. (5 are listed). Someone wrote a mainstream romantic comedy script -- then someone else (The Brothers, I'm guessing) came along and just stuck in gross shocking bits.It's very uneven. It loses steam in the third act. Has a very unsatisfying and unpleasant ending. Carlos Mencia is obnoxious. Ben is looking too old to be playing these parts. Meanwhile, the girls still look 25.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a little surprised at how badly people are panning this movie; I usually find IMDb ratings to be a good indicator. Many of the negative comments seem to be based on the movie not conforming to the typical 'good guy always wins,' formula driven, oh-so predictable crap that Hollywood tends to pump out. I see one reviewer here actually put "they couldn't even deliver the cliché ending" as if that is something to be strived for. As for me, if I want a morality lesson I'll go to church. If you're looking for a comedy to give you lessons on how to live your life, you've got serious problems.I'm still only giving the movie a seven because it's a comedy, it's not like it was so moving that it changed my life or anything. As comedies go, though, I found it pretty good. It's not one of those constant, laugh a minute, slapstick comedies, but the parts that did make me laugh literally made me laugh out loud, which is pretty rare for me. All in all, this is one of the best comedies I have seen in years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50% of marriages nowadays end in divorce...20% of this movie lacks laughs...100% of this movie lacks morality and heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Farrelly brothers have had a successful history, but their best work was past them a long time ago. Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary are among the two funniest comedies of all-time, and put the brothers at the peak of stardom. However, their track record afterwards is a heavily mixed bag; you find your underrated gems (Osmosis Jones, Fever Pitch) and then your disasters (Shallow Hal, Stuck on You). The Heartbreak Kid is their attempt to reach back into grade-A stardom like back in the late 90s. Joining with old friend Ben Stiller, they attempt to successfully recreate an old Neil Simon story about a man who has second thoughts about his marriage during his honeymoon. What we get is a cruel, twisted, vulgar, outrageous, and bittersweet movie that tramples over morality and messes around with the typical romantic comedy formula. Unfortunately though, the cruelty in this movie prevents it from being anywhere near romantic. While the Farrelly brothers crafted their best work since Osmosis Jones, this is still nowhere near as good as their comedies of the previous decade.Heartbreak Kid is about Eddie (Ben Stiller), a lonely man who meets a woman (Lila, played by Malin Akerman) during a random encounter, and after a few weeks believes that she is the perfect woman for him. However, right after the wedding, another side of his perfect woman is revealed, and is slowly but surely becoming a nightmare come true. Despite their honeymoon being in a beautiful portion of Mexico, the honeymoon is a disaster as Eddie struggles to survive being with his new wife. Worst of all, during the honeymoon he meets another woman, Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), who seems to be absolutely perfect for him. In this cruel script, nobody is the hero, and seemingly everybody is the victim in some way or another. Nobody is safe in the movie; which makes this story perfect for the Farrelly Brothers.Ben Stiller seems to play the same kind of role multiple times, as he has a similar presence to that of his character in There's Something About Mary and Along Came Polly. The only difference is, he's a bit more sinister and a much bigger jerk. His new wife is portrayed perfectly by Malin Akerman, who isn't afraid of embarrassing herself or showing off her body. Their physical humor together creates the biggest laughs in the movie. The most desirable character by far comes from the best performance; Michelle Monaghan of Mission Impossible fame delivers this charming, sweet performance as the adorable and beautiful Miranda. Everyone else did a decent job, with Jerry Stiller in a throwaway role as Eddie's father and Carlos Mencia (surprisingly funny) as a manager of the hotel in Mexico.This movie's biggest flaw is its obvious attempts to re-create the surprise vulgarity and bittersweet content of There's Something About Mary. It worked back then, but it has trouble now, simply because the characters are not as likable, and the movie lacks heart. In Dumb and Dumber, you knew that they weren't meant to get that dream girl, but their persistence and their kindness (hidden underneath their stupidity) allows for the audience to root for them regardless. In There's Something About Mary, the main character goes to great lengths to find Mary and attempt to be with her; it became a raunchy and bizarre hero's journey. In this movie, the main character selfishly marries, and tramples over other people (emotionally mind you) in order to find his actual soulmate; making him not a necessarily likable character.In spite of the lack of heart, you will find the laughs, no denying that. The new wife from hell routine was spoiled far too much in the previews, yet was still enjoyable. Unfortunately, once again, misdirection keeps Heartbreak Kid from being funnier than it could have been. After a while, Lila practically disappears from the movie, focusing more on Eddie's budding romance with Miranda. The movie mellows down once Lila is out of the way, and then we see a train wreck waiting to happen for about half an hour. If you are a fan of There's Something About Mary, there will be plenty to laugh about, but none of the content is rich or deep; most of the funniest scenes happens to be gross-out and shock humor. One unique thing in Heartbreak Kid is pretty crappy special effects, which makes it worse for this kind of movie because these kinds of movies do not use much special effects, if any at all. Soundtrack also isn't as catchy or as fun as other Farrelly Brothers movies, especially Dumb and Dumber.Bottom Line: Heartbreak Kid is funny, but its not an instant classic, nor is it a type of movie to take a date to. While it is not as painfully disastrous as Good Luck Chuck, it still pales in comparison to recent adult comedies and early Farrelly efforts. Ben Stiller still provides the laughs through his physical humor and his ability to perfectly portray a man mentally breaking down. However, this movie has major morality issues and then really slows down once the romance builds up, yet we aren't rooting for anybody because everyone is guilty of lying, deceiving, and worse (except for one character). The directors are somewhat on the right track back to their glory days, but still have a longs way to go. They also really need to grow up and try to fray away from the gross humor, something that Mike Myers suffers from. Looking for laughs? Look no further. Looking for an amazing film? Keep looking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stuff it up your nose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't believe how terrible this movie is. And the Oscar goes to "The Heartbreak Kid" in the category of the worst remake of a film ever made. Even without comparing it to the original, the movie fails miserably in and of itself. I just got out of a showing of the film, where there were some initial laughs, but by halfway through the movie, there was basically dead silence in the theater for the rest of it. This is expected to be funny: the crazy cousin hitting each of Ben Stiller's legs with a baseball bat; Ben Stiller trying to pull a big pain pill out of Lila's nose with her deviated septum; Lila apparently smashing what she thought was Ben Stiller's member; a sideshow where a donkey is apparently going to hump a young Mexican lady; Miranda's cousins shoving a hot pepper up Ben Stiller's nose, Lila peeing on Ben Stiller on the beach as he is screaming in agony because of a jellyfish sting, endless hitting and bashing of Ben Stiller by practically everyone including Lila in her sexual frenzy, and on and on. The movie commits a bad crime for a comedy - the outrageous antics add up to cringes, not laughs. For those of us that remember the quirky, extremely clever and funny original, the comparison with this ugly, mean-spirited piece of dreck is almost painful. Other than two of the character's names, and the basic premise of a man falling in love with another woman on his honeymoon, and a couple of the same lines and plot devices early on, there is simply no resemblance. In the original, the only "bad guy" is Lenny - and that's simply because he's devious and dishonest, even though one can completely understand and identify with his predicament. In the original version, one feels for each and everyone of the other characters- Lila in her oblivious ignorance with her annoying (not horrific-like in the current version) habits, Kelly (Lenny's love interest--Miranda in the remake), selfish but coolly beautiful, Kelly's over-protective parents - it adds up to a surprisingly perceptive movie with regard to people's hopes and desires. And, Heck ---- it's just so damn funny with truly great clever dialog, unlike the newer version. In the new version, for some reason the same plot makes no sense, and one could care less about any of the characters. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I laughed out loud. It looked like this was going to be a hilarious movie. I had heard how the characters were switched around - which made total sense in a remake, not just simply to redo the original, but make a new version with its own set of perceptions and laughs. BUT THEN, I read a review that said that the trailer contained the only funny moments in the film. I couldn't believe that. But now I do. Those few funny moments that are in the trailer are all that there is to laugh at. Save your self 10 bucks and a couple of extra hours in the day - watch the trailer, have a good laugh, and then rent or buy the original. A MUCH more satisfying experience!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First half so-so, second half quite funny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid isn't right up there in the list of great comedies starring Ben Stiller. It's a bit further down, nestled in amongst the likes of Along Came Polly and Envy.That's not to say it isn't a good film. As far as romcoms go, it's alright. I think it's fair to say the first half trudges along quite slowly but stick with it while the main characters are introduced and the plot is founded because the second half is nicely paced with some very funny moments as things start to conclude. The cliffhanger ending is surprisingly delightful and watch for a final funny scene around halfway through the end credits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After the marriage, boredom kicks in!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How the mighty have fallen! The Farrely Brothers once upon a time were the kings of comedy, with a string of hits under their belts and some laugh out loud movies that included Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary, they were truly unstoppable. Then something happened, they suddenly made flops, or at least disappointments. Stuck On You in my mind is where this all began, uneven comedies that while having some good moments were just so unmemorable it was unbelievable. I never saw The Ringer, I didn't agree with the subject matter hence why I didn't watch it, but I was actually really looking forward to The Heartbreak Kid. The trailer made me laugh and it looked like a return to Mary territory. I went into this movie expecting a short, light hearted comedy with some hilarious moments. I came out bored to tears, having only laughed a few times and feeling really cheated and also very disappointed. The Heartbreak Kidis unfortunately a big flop and is definitely the Brothers weakest movie to date in my mind. This wouldn't bother me if everything about the movie was unbelievably awful, but the most frustrating thing is that there are moments in this movie that are genuinely brilliant. The storyline itself is great, the characters are great, the tone is right, so where the hell did it go some damn wrong? My guess is that studio interference has a large part to play. The gross out Farrely humour just does not gel with the sweet romance story at the centre of it all. Also the movie is way too long and the script way too uneven for this to be a good movie. This may not be the worst movie of the year in my eyes but its certainly one of the most frustrating. Ben Stiller is great, Malin Akerman is superb, there are scenes and ideas that are brilliant, the ending is pitch perfect, yet everything else is just so poorly executed!So lets start with the cast which admittedly is the most consistently decent thing in the movie. Ben Stiller is on a return to form in this movie, after a few cameos here and there and a phoned in performance in Night in the Museum he finally seems at ease. In fact this is arguably his best work in my eyes since Dodgeball, not hard when you see his recent line of work. His natural easy going charm works in this movie and makes a potentially unlikable character, and actually at times his character remains very unlikable, just a bit more tolerable. A shame then the script gives him little comedy to work with, that is until a priceless psychotic breakdown over a Mexican band, which is one of the few highlights of the movie. The true star of the movie however is Malin Akerman as the psychotic Lila. Akerman seems to have a blast as the mad, former junkie, in debt, clingy, neurotic wife from hell. However I found something very strange while watching this movie, I actually felt sorry for Lila for a lot of the film. Sure when she's having sex and beating the hell out of her husband its hard to feel sorry for her, but when Ben Stiller is cheating on her its kind of sad. Whether or not this is intentional or not is debatable however. Michelle Monaghan definitely drew the short straw of the group in a role that is pretty pointless and just too unoriginal for me to give a damn about.The humour of the movie and the unevenness of pace is definitely where the Heartbreak Kid literally breaks. The movie does start off quite well, sure its not classic but its amusing. In fact the start of the honeymoon is relatively funny, but then about the halfway mark the movie just gives up all hope and dies. The jokes dry up, the romance and sentimentality factor kick in and the eyes start to droop. Despite some decent one liners the movie just doesn't make an effort any more. You find yourself not caring anymore, you couldn't care if Eddie stays with Lila or not, you just want the movie to end. And then the film drones on and on and on. And then when you think you have an ending it suddenly does something else. Thankfuly the unexpected ending lifts things up slightly, but the standard beforehand is so low it doesn't redeem the movie. In fact take out the brilliant Mexican band running joke, the amusing sunburn bit, the few sex scenes and a couple of one liners this would struggle its already low 5/10 rating.The Heartbreak Kid is really a movie I cannot recommend as it is way too disappointing. The cast do an admirable job with little material and the idea is there. A better movie is probably underneath this wretched turd somewhere, but unfortunately for now this movie remains just another lame addition to the Farrely brothers already struggling CV. The Farrely brother may have once been the kings of gross out comedy, but in an age when we have Knocked Up and Superbad, maybe its time they gave up and tried something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie could NOT have been worse. Not possible. My husband and I watched.....oh I say over and hour before we just couldn't take it anymore. We got up and left the theater. That bad. There was NO character development AT ALL. Okay, enough where you knew their names...but that's about it. I really don't think anything the poor girl did was that bad. Okay, so she can't sing...um...ME NEITHER!!! And she got a bad sunburn. I'm sure we all did at one point in our lives. And her mom is big. Well, there's a a good reason to not love her. Whatever. Oh and the whole comedy thing, no that didn't exist either. I don't know, go and see it. But remember, I told you so. Have a nice day!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I walked in expecting to see "the best Ben Stiller movie yet" and walked out feeling gross and upset to have spent ANY money on a ticket to have seen such crap. The beginning of the film was funny with typical Farrelly/Stiller moments of awkward situations. Even though it was much more crude than any of the previous films these collaboraters have done, I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt. However, the laughs quickly stopped. This was severely disappointing. I understand the Farrelly brothers are the masters of the "uncomfortable" moment, but they cross the line with this movie, over and over again. It was sleazy and an awful commentary on current views of marriage. Yuck!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I made the mistake of seeing this crap because I thought it was going to be a hilarious escape movie. The reasons it was so bad are many and other people have listed them here. But the main reason is that Ben Stillers character was such a self-centered, unlikable jerk. He usually plays a loser, but ultimately a likable loser that you want to root for. Here he's a lying, misogynistic pig of a man who treats others with complete disregard. I absolutely hated him. And the twist at the end just makes you want to see him get tortured for being such an a-hole. Horrible, horrible movie.Please do yourself a favor and skip this one. Trust me, if you've seen the previews you've seen the only mildly funny parts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good and fun movie. I generally like Farrelly movies. If you do, go see this one. I just rented the DVD and had a lot of fun with it. The extras on the DVD are also fun to watch. San Francisco as well as Mexico look spectacular in this movie. The locations act as another character and add a lot to the movie. The women in this movie are very pretty and likable. Of course nobody should treat somebody like that - but the title of the movie is "Heartbreak Kid", so I guess what else can we expect. This movie is not "Mary", but I enjoyed it a lot. It has some weaknesses. We don't really like or dislike some of the characters - the script could have made clearer choices. We don't really root for anybody (even though I wished, he stayed with his wife - she seemed cute, nice enough and willing to change if he just had asked). Overall a typical Farrelly movie, very creative, fun to watch but some weaknesses to the script. Also many, many great performances by actors in supporting roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't Watch This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to begin? I rarely write reviews on movies, excluding those that are truly magnificent - in my humble opinion - or truly horrific. Unfortunately, this falls into the latter category. It is apropos that Stiller plays the lead role, as I can think of no other actor that would touch this role with a ten foot pool. The audience has no one to root for as the protagonist, Stiller, is a scum-sucking horrible being. To briefly summarize, Stiller plays Eddie, a 40-something year old who has commitment issues. When he meets Lyla and begins a whirlwind romance, his friends root for him to finally take the plunge. After a quick wedding the newlyweds begin their honeymoon and begin to discover each other and their past. Dismayed, Eddie begins to romance Miranda, who is blissfully unaware of Eddie's prior situation. The movie fails on every level. The laughs are few and sparse, and of the slapstick variety. The morale of the story reflects what is wrong with American society today. The concept of love is portrayed as arbitrary and something that we have no control of. When Eddie encounters a few stumbling blocks instead of trying to work them out with Lyla - which she does indeed attempt to - he turns to attempt a new romance immediately. Do yourself a favor, and pass on this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Farrely Brothers did it again ! One more good comedy for their list. I don't understand people saying this film is bad, cruel or something. This film is great, has a lot of funny moments, terrific cast and a rocking soundtrack. Who wants more than 1 hour and a half of pure fun, laughs and weird moments. The story is simple: Eddie (Ben Stiller) is a bachelor who finds what seems to be the perfect girl. He marries her only to find that she's a living nightmare. Later, he meets another girl and wind up falling in love with her. That's where the fun begins when he gets into a terrible mess with his wife and his new affair. The film is not politically correct, but fun don't have to be correct. Fun is fun and is meant to make you laugh and the film truly deliver the goods. If you are too moral about wedding, loyalty, good manners, please don't see this movie cause you probably will not like it. The ending really surprised me. I thought it was going to be something like sweet and warm. Instead, we have a real life, non-moral type of ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie...was awful. It was disgusting, offensive, and not even funny. I expected more from Ben Stiller - a quality romantic comedy, not a vehicle for sexual and scatological "humor" (and I use the term VERY loosely). The plot holes were endless - how did those twin boys keep showing up everywhere? I felt no sympathy for Ben Stiller's character and no spark between him and Miranda (she was annoying, too). The Mariachi band wasn't even funny. I felt that Ben's character got what he deserved. If the main character is unlikable, then the rest of the movie has nowhere to go. I wouldn't recommend this to my worst enemy and I wish I hadn't wasted two hours watching it. And the ending?????? Terrible!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a spectacularly unfunny movie.Jerry Stiller - whom I love in King of Queens and Seinfeld - is absolutely horrible as the foul-mouthed 77 year old father. His stream of obscenities are not so much funny as they are unbelievable.Ben Stiller, as usual, is not funny. His character is a pathetic loser who is impossible to either identify with or like at all. And that he marries his girlfriend without knowing not even a single iota about her personal life is ludicrous and 100% unbelievable. The writers made her character totally unlikeable which should make us root for Stiller, but his character was just so blah that I found myself rooting for her.The characters are shallow, the gross-out humor is not even so much gross as it is just plain makes you cringe at it's awkwardness.The character's attempts to return to America late in the movie felt like they were tacked on as an afterthought in an attempt to update the movie and make it feel topical. These scenes do not work at all.Could go on, but I think I've made my point.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heartbreak Kid is truly AWFUL! I wouldn't even give it one star if I had the option. I'd give it a -10. Do they give movies LEMON ratings?Why? It claimed to be a comedy, but only had cruel, slapstick style gags. The wife gets a sunburn so bad that she would have been hospitalized in real life. How can that be funny? Stiller's character took advantage of that and stayed around a second woman that he soon claimed to be his "true love." On top of that, there were sex scenes that deserved a NC-17 or worse rating with at least one racial slur. Unfortunately, these problems aren't the worst part! At the end, the script turned a so-so movie into a horrible waste of money and time. The "kid" had a chance to be with his "true love", but then we see that he has NOT learned his lesson. He is still trying to be with two women! I want my money back. Don't waste yours!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heavy-handed remake of the 1972 original replaces selfish adults with immature brats...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sporting goods store owner (Ben Stiller, incredulous as ever) from San Francisco has a whirlwind courtship and marriage to a leggy blonde which culminates in disaster once they honeymoon down Mexico way; she reveals a seamy past, an uncertain financial future, and a deviated septum while he falls for a dryly humorous brunette on vacation with her relatives (they meet when she drops her camera over the balcony). Bruce Jay Friedman's original story (and Neil Simon's 1972 adaptation) retooled for the "There's Something About Mary" generation. What was originally played for ethnic laughs (Jews vs. Gentiles) has been substituted with what can only be described as nasal-passage humor. Five screenwriters worked on this bombastic version, including the directors Bobby and Peter Farrelly, but the jokes are nasty and ugly throughout. Elaine May's version was unsympathetic and cruel, but at least had credible characters. Stiller believes his new lady-friend and her family are aware he has a wife, unaware they think he's a grieving widower and that his spouse was viciously murdered! The scenario, laden with misunderstandings and dim slapstick worthy of a "Three's Company" rerun, is so wrongheaded that even the gags which should work tend to fail. The glossy locale turns out to be a presumptuous obstacle in the proceedings (it overwhelms the slim little plot), while the romantic entanglements are not unraveled with any smarts. What a missed opportunity! This tale is ripe for satiric barbs, but the writing team aims instead for low-brow shenanigans made to appeal to an audience of the lowest common denominator. * from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film got a raw deal and that is heartbreaking!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a heartbreak it must have been for the quirky director siblings The Farrelly Brothers when their latest outlandish comedy "The Heartbreak Kid" broke in as a box office disappointment. It did not help matters much when critics did not have a heart and ripped it to shreds. However, I am not one of those critics; probably because I do not have the certification to be a critic. All kidding aside, I thought "The Heartbreak Kid" was a laugh riot! Let me break the narrative to you. Ben Stiller stars as Eddie Cantrow, a San Francisco sporting goods owner who marries Lila, a woman he has only known for six weeks. Lila is played by the up-and-coming Malin Akerman. The movie is primarily set in Cabo, Mexico which is where Eddie and Lila go on their honeymoon. In Cabo, Eddie discovers that Lila is not the woman he thought she was and before you could say "se acabo in Cabo" he craves to stay apart from loony Lila. In Cabo, Eddie also meets a Mississippi cutie redneck woman named Miranda; played also by another up-and-coming actress Michelle Monaghan. Mr. Eddie all of a sudden wants to horse around with Miranda behind his wife's back. Plot twists eventually get more zany &amp; bizarre, and of course what is a Farrelly movie without some Farrellycious gross comedy. Stiller, Akerman, and Monaghan did put their heart into their commendable comedic performances. Also, some other praiseworthy acting broke into "The Heartbreak Kid" in the form of: Jerry Stiller playing Eddie's dad Doc, Rob Corddry playing Eddie's follicle challenged best friend Mac, and Danny McBride playing Miranda's overprotective redneck cousin Martin. The Farrelly Brothers far-out comedy does go into a roller-coaster turn at times, but it was riding way high in most of "The Heartbreak Kid". I thought "The Heartbreak Kid" was in the apex of comedic popcorn entertainment for 2007, and I do wholeheartedly mean that. ***** Excellent</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And that's incredibly sad after seeing Pink Flamingo's last year, I mean The Heartbreak Kid was just one of the most stupid films I have seen. There was absolutely nothing funny about this movie and I don't understand it's rating. The Farally brothers have lost their gift, because I have no idea what they were smoking when they came up with this film and thought it would be a good idea. Ben Stiller also, I mean, his character was absolutely the biggest jerk I have ever seen on film and was in no way likable. I think that was the main problem I was having with this movie was due to the fact that I think Ben Stiller's character was supposed to be likable, but there was no saving him from the way this script was written, because he is in no way justifiable. The Heartbreak Kid was definitely the worst film of 2007.Eddie is starting to feel a bit alone in the world filled with love sick couples. But that all changes when he meets a beautiful girl, Lila, and after 6 weeks of dating her, she needs to go to a different country for a job, but Eddie is feeling so good that with the pressure from his dad and friend, he marries her. They go on their honeymoon and Eddie finds out that Lila have some disturbing traits to her personality. But his vacation quickly changes when he meets Miranda who is on a family reunion, and he falls in love with her. But of course, since he's still "technically" married, it gets hard to tell Miranda.The Heartbreak Kid has some of the most uncomfortable nudity I've ever seen. I have no problem with nudity in films depending on the context, but this script was so awful, like how Lila loved being a freak in bed. OK, I get it after the first scene, but they continue this weird joke for a few more scenes, not to mention her jellyfish scene with Ben was beyond gross. This was just an unnecessary film in every aspect, the script needs at least some major work because the characters are awful and so is the story. Please stay away from this junk, it's not worth your time.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible and a waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general, people review a film out of will because they either loved it, or hated it. I am sorry to say but this review was written because I hated "The Heartbreak Kid". I went to see this film after weeks of anticipation. I am a huge Ben Stiller fan ? as well as a fan of the Farrelly Brothers, so I thought, "this film is going to be gooood". No, no, no. Don't even consider seeing this film. Sure, you may get a few laughs out of it- (the beginning is averagely funny) but those few laughs will be strongly outweighed later in the film and you will just be filled with a feeling of discontent. I must say "The Heartbreak kid" is the worst film I have seen in a long, long time. It is definitely the worst Stiller film of all time. And yes I even saw "Night At The Museum"- Night As The Museum is "The Godfather" in comparison to this film. I can't even begin to explain how much a waste of your life seeing this film will be. Please do something else for 2 hours instead of seeing this film - unless you like horrible characters, plots, very-very-try-hard humour, then go ahead and waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Heartbreak Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a fan of Ben Stiller and his brand of comedy, and I rate his insanely good looking (heh) Derek Zoolander as one of my contemporary favourites, alongside his Dodgeball opposite Vince Vaughn, and his Meet The Parents/Fockers combo. But perhaps the most memorable and highly rated laughfest will be his starring in the Farrelly Brothers' There's Something About Mary, with Matt Dillon and Cameron Diaz as the ditzy blonde the two guys are trying to go after.The Heartbreak Kid brings Stiller back to the Farrelly Brothers' fold, joining forces again to bring in the laughs in a situation that unmarried guys my age fear. While we may be nonchalant about staying single and enjoying the status to sow our wild oats, there's always this nagging thought about what would happen when we seem to have met that special someone who could be just the very person to spend the rest of our life with. Thinking about "forever", that it's a long time, make us go into weighing in the pros and the cons of giving up our freedom, and we just want to be darn sure (and suicidal) to be giving up our singlehood.And for forty year old Eddie (Stiller), he shares the same sentiments, but on the advise of best buddy Mac (Rob Corddry), who himself is a hen-pecked husband, and Casanova dad Doc (Jerry Stiller, Ben's real father), he marries Lila (Malin Akerman), the blonde akin to Cameron Diaz's Mary in the earlier Farrelly-Stiller collaboration, on a whim after six weeks of courtship. While on the surface, she's physically da bomb, and might seem all nice and dandy inside, little does Eddie know the nightmare is about to begin, as he discovers (say what?) they share very little interests, she's the archetypal dumb blonde always made fun of in blonde jokes, and she's a sexual nymph who likes it very rough (ok, so some of us out there might take this as a plus point).If there's a moral to the story, that will be to consider very carefully, and to take your time before you commit to that matrimonial vow. You might call me old-fashioned, but I believe that once you walk down that aisle, you'll just have to stick with the woman you marry, for better or worse, and learn to accept her faults. After all, nobody's perfect. But this is a movie, so if anyone is holding onto such real-world ideal notions, then you'll probably not have a good time, and start to frown at every Eddie antic at his horror of discovery, and worse, when he starts to develop feelings for Miranda (Michelle Monaghan, last scene on the big screen playing Ethan Hunt's wife in MI:III), an equally attractive woman who probably shares more of the same interests as Eddie, whom he met while on honeymoon.Wait a minute, cheating on your wife during honeymoon? Yes, which is why the conservatives out there will leave with a bad aftertaste. But for the rest of us, it examines the type of dilemma for someone having second thoughts (after all, these are fertile grounds for affairs). The narrative starts to junk the comedy and move into romance-drama gears, but lest you forget this is still a Farrelly Brothers' movie, their trademark sexually vulgar scenes and jokes come and surprise you when you least expect. Body parts (there's this scene involving bodily fluids which you just have to see to believe the insane audacity of it all) and orifices are no longer sacred. Comedy of errors are standard fare, as are the increasing inserts of gay jokes whenever possible. However most jokes were still on Lila, and plenty of that were already included in the trailer, so if you haven't watched it, don't.As a comedy, The Heartbreak Kid somehow didn't live up to its promise. Sure it has its moments, but they were few and far between, and in reality, you'll probably enjoy the Eddie- Miranda romantic scenes (and those with her family) a lot more than you would the Eddie- Lila comedic scenes. Does it have an ending and resolution to Eddie's dilemma of which girl to choose? Yes, but it turned out to be extremely clunky and unfunny (try as it would want to), dragging out the last act unnecessarily to put this movie close to a two hour runtime. It's still a comedy after all, so don't expect a very powerful and emotional close ala dramatic fare like Castaway, which it tried to ape, with a comedic slant of course.Deinitely not one of Stiler's, or the Farrelly Brother's best work to date. Stay tuned for the cameo appearance of one prominent TV actress at the close, and stay tuned during and after the end credits. There's a scene involving Lila, which probably isn't in very good taste, showing how she managed to get satisfied, and the other bringing you back to 1975 to confirm a certain event which was mentioned in passing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stiller has made some funny movies but his brain must have gone walkabout for this one. This is pure drivel - and frankly horrible at times. There are a lot of unnecessary and tasteless sex scenes that would look out of place in one of those cheap teen romps, let alone in a movie about supposedly fairly mature people.The characters are one-dimensional and mostly unpleasant people who cannot possibly captivate any audience with half a brain. The stereotypes are from another age - getting white people to dress up and put on a funny accent to play Mexicans is not something you expect to see in the 21st century.Having had the misfortune to waste my money on the DVD, the 'special features' endorse my opinion that this film was made by a bunch of immature, ignorant half-wits. Just don't waste your time on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In short this movie is about a man who marries a woman he doesn't know and on their moneymoon he gets to know who she really is. He ends up hating her and falls in love with someone else on the trip.I think you are supposed to feel bad for the husband and root for him, but I just ended up hating him and feeling bad for his wife.Sure she isn't perfect, but he is far worse than her in my opinion.The things she does "wrong" are fairly normal in my opinion.She sings loudly in the car, accidentally farts while he hears it, are aggressive in bed, get a sunburn and end up having a pill stuck in her nose.The things he does however are far worse and just wrong.He is disgusted instead of supportive when she opens up to him and admit she used to be an addict, disgusted when she accidentally farts while he is present and down right mean as he disappears with another woman while his wife is at the hotel in tears because of a sunburn that causes her to look like a monster.He talks down to her because she isn't very intelligent, and is downright rude about her job. She is not paid as it is for charity and thus it isn't a job to him - just a hobby.Sure you should never marry someone you don't know, but most of these things he experiences with his wife are normal.I keep thinking of her point of view.He is annoyed at everything she does and dishonest about how he feels about it when she asks him. He choose to leave her alone in tears and go party with another woman on their honeymoon - and then lie about it when he returns.He is basically a scumbag. He lies about everything and is never honest - leading his poor wife on to believe nothing is wrong up until she discovers the truth.Horrible!!</fullReview>

Normally in romantic comedies one of the main character's love interests is so obviously perfect while the other is so obviously bad. In this movie, both love interests were horrible. There was no reason for either couple to be together. I could ignore this if there were funny jokes. There weren't, Not one. And the last thing that can save a horrible movie is eye candy. There was none. Neither of the female leads were attractive. Nothing much else I can say about this movie except It's bad, bad, bad.

		<fullReview>Lumpy and sour, "The Heartbreak Kid" is filled with crude language, crude jokes, and crude sex, little of which is even faintly amusing. It is almost entirely devoid of jokes that work or characters that are even remotely interesting. The character-driven comedy finds all the characters unsympathetic figures who seem either twisted, monstrous, shallow or just plain bad eggs. The film is limp and, for long stretches, quite tedious. I found it largely gross, mean-spirited, frustrating, and ugly. The occasional laughs provided aren't frequent enough or uproarious enough to warrant an investment of nearly two hours of a viewer's time.</fullReview>

Truly lacking in laughs and the fact that the awful Mencia is in this really takes the air out of the room. A huge disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Ben Stiller Movie Yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really disappointed in Jerry Stillers role. He wasn't funny at all and in the whole movie his character just felt wrong for him. They should have had a younger best friend character play the role not a 77 year old man. I think they were trying to make that the joke but it just made Jerry look bad and weak minded. I like slapstick humor and loved "Something about Mary" which this movie is plugged with but "Heartbreak" is a "2" on my scale and "Something about Mary" was a "10". You end up hating Ben Stiller's character for having no integrity and the woman actress who he is paired up with in the movie was not a good match. She played a silly high school musical quality role in this film. They just had an all around bad cast match up for this movie and the writing was so bad the only laughs it got from me was from "Uncle Tito" role who wasn't in the movie enough and a few lines here and there. I am glad I waited to see it on DVD for a buck. It had the same value as a losing scratch ticket.</fullReview>

Don't get me wrong - I'm all for crude humour, if it is well-done and, well, connected to likable characters that manage to transport it. In this movie, however, there ARE no characters, just raw drafts wandering around hitting and peeing on each other. "The Heartbreak Kid" takes so little interest in its characters that makes any of the "Police Academy"-Parts look like art cinema and, no, I'm not being hyperbolic. The movie is THAT bad.

		<fullReview>Why is Ben Stiller type-casted as someone stupid in every movie that he is in? I rarely give movies 2 stars, but I am giving this one 2 stars. Ben's character is single. He is laughed at by kids for being single during a wedding reception of his friend. He tries to save a gullible lady from a mugger. They get married right away. During the honeymoon, he meets another lovely young lady. He finds out that his newlywed wife has been lying to him the whole time. So he cheats on his newlywed with the other woman during the honeymoon. The highlight of the movie was when the Mexican musicians continued to interrupt them with music while they were trying to talk.

For example, how a guy from San Francisco road trips to Cabo, if it takes just from the border to Cabo, 22 hours of driving. That's definitely insane. Then, what about the "burro" stuff??? I've been to Cabo and as far as I know there's no such thing as the burro attraction. In Mexico we have cars , bikes, motorcycles and everything they have in any other country!!! Then Ben Stiller talks about chimichangas. That's not even Mexican!!! That's TEx-Mex!!! WTF??????? Guacamole certainly is but there are other dishes more representative of true Mexican food! The worst commentary is the one made by the girl that married Stiller who says Mexico being a third world country is a very dangerous place, and not satisfied with that, during the whole movie she keeps on talking bad things about Mexican stuff. That's really annoying.As a Mexican I judge this movie as a total piece of rubbish and you would certainly find it too, even though, you weren't a Mexican.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1994,the Farrelly brothers became famous with the brilliant comedy Dumb and Dumber,a film without sophisticated or intellectual humor(really,it was a vulgar humor) but with lots of laughs and the Farrelly bros,appeared as two very promising talents in the comedy genre.Then,they continued with other three excellent comedies which are Kingpin,There's Something About Mary(their best work to date) and Me,Myself and Irene.But,after the last mentioned film,the Farrelly bros. started with a row of mediocre comedies which were very far away from their first four films.After the tedious romantic comedy Fever Pitch,I thought the Farrelly bros. were going to redeem themselves with their new film.But it was not like that.The Heartbreak Kid is a tedious,unfunny ''comedy'' and the worst movie in the career of these two directors.The Heartbreak Kid is one of that films which is always trying to make us laugh.But it fatally fails on that intention.On the first half,I frequently looked to my watch.But it gets worse on the second half and,on that moment,I was all the way through looking to it.One of the few good elements on this crappy film is Malin Akerman's performance.Akerman is great on her role and she gave to this film the four points I put to it.The Heartbreak Kid is a tedious film and an enormous waste of 116 minutes.I hope the Farrelly bros. will back to their best on their next movie to make us forget of this pathetic moment of their careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, maybe in private life, god bless him. He's a comedic actor, and therefore I want to see him get the sh*t. I want to see him get his nads caught in a zipper on his prom date with his dream girl whilst wearing dental braces in his pimply face, to name one scene that comes to mind. I don't want to have to witness him date the two cutest girls on face of the earth for 90 minutes. That would maybe be a romantic date movie, but not a comedy. Do I really have to spell this out the Farrelly brothers, the innovators of the comedic genre in the 1990ies? How on earth could it go all so wrong? One of my suspicion: Too many writers. Then: Let them do comedy, for Pete's sakes! Not romance. Then: The whole movie is visually way to perfect for a comedy. In the DVD commentary, the Farrelly brothers claim that this is their best-looking movie to date. Only too true, and part of the problem. I felt like I was watching a commercial by the Mexican tourism board. (Although it's an interesting point that while "There's Something ..." idealized Miami, it was still funny. But then the plot didn't involve a honeymoon.) Next: Crude can be funny. But crude must not be funny. Crude can be just crude. I'll just say "C*ck me", queefs and donkeyrape. Again, who am I telling this to? Next, this was the first movie that made me feel that the Farrellys are just out of touch. If accused of being gay, you don't fervently deny it. It's OK for women to fart or get sunburns. "Bad music taste" and a dodgy nasal septum don't qualify as divorce reasons.A short sequence of the movie where the Farrelly manage to rekindle their own style is where Ben Stiller escapes from Mexico. So they still have it in them. Let's all just pray that they don't't attempt to do romance anymore.</fullReview>

Now I know remakes are usually not good as the originals but this one really sucked compared to the original and I don't even have to see the original to tell, because the crude jokes were tasteless, not that funny although it does have it's moment although very few, and it's just boring. And no one in this film was even likable and just makes you want to barf after seeing the characters interact with one another, especially Ben Stiller's character. Probably not the one of a good movie I seen for these types of genre but not the worst either, it just felt like they were trying too hard with the jokes in a unfunny manner.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you mix immaturity with desperation you get a catastrophe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid is a deplorable comedy with a seriously backwards moral compass. It's billed as a romantic comedy but I'm struggling to find a romantic side to its dreadful, nihilistic comedy. It isn't enough that the film be impossibly unromantic but also completely dirty-minded and cynical to the point where liking it is above and beyond the call of a cinematic duty. This is the kind of third-rate schlock that belongs in the straight-to-DVD pile along with comedies such as Road Trip: Beer Pong. Not the film by the Farrelly brothers, two of the most prominent and respected names in comedy/gross-out comedy.Along with bearing two respectable directors, the film also has headliners such as Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller, Michelle Monaghan, Malin ?kerman, Rob Corrdry, Carlos Mencia, and Danny McBride that it victimizes to its awfulness. Ben Stiller stars as Eddie, the owner of a sports-store, who is single and hesitant about opening up the door and starting a new relationship. One day, however, he sees a woman named Lila (Malin ?kerman) being victim to a harsh mugging. While failing to retrieve her purse, they sort of hit it off and go on to date after meeting each other once more. Lila, however, is a member of some environmental science group, and, because she's single, is offered a trip to study abroad. Even though they're only about six weeks into the relationship, Eddie goes out on a whim and proposes to Lila, throwing complete caution to the wind and the two decide to honeymoon in Cabo San Lucas. Upon marrying her, Eddie doesn't realize that marrying Lila could be the biggest mistake of his life, as she is completely obnoxious, not self-aware to the feelings of others, likes her sex a bit too rough, and has no social boundaries whatsoever. In walks Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a simple, older woman who is on vacation with her cousins so her aunt/uncle can renew their wedding vows for the umpteenth time. After Lila gets a painful and embarrassing sunburn, Eddie completely sidelines her and favors Miranda's company, an already despicable move on his part. But as the film goes on, it's clear that Eddie's personality is predicated off of senseless actions and moves to make him in power over everyone else.A reminder: this is the man we're so supposed to call our protagonist. This schmuck is the man whom we're supposed to side and sympathize with throughout the film. The Farrellys' first fatal flaw is that they give us a lead character who is completely unconscionable and unlikable. He's mercilessly rude, as un-self aware as his wife, and always seems to know how to do the wrong thing at the wrong time. His wife, on the other hand, is no better, playing an insufferable nag who finds ways to be more and more obnoxious to the point where her very presence treads the line of being totally unrealistic. It's sad to see Stiller and ?kerman get such lowly characters in a comedy, but it's almost as bad as the Farrelly brothers failing at what they're known best for - gross- out humor. There is a line between gross-out humor and just being flat out immature and desperate and it's such a thin, easy line to cross into the latter territory that it explains why many writers/directors opt-out of it. Consider the scene where Eddie is being attacked by a jellyfish and, upon ripping it off his back, Lila pulls down her jeans, sprouts open her vagina like a Venus-fly-trap, and proceed to urinate on her husband's back to numb the pain. The scene is agonizingly awful and has no laughs to offer. It reeks of total desperation for laughs that it wouldn't be worth commenting on if it weren't for the numerous things it does wrong. It effectively makes nearly every character involved more unlikable than they already were.If we want to get really involved and lay our criticism on thick, look how this film portrays middle-aged American bachelors. They look like cold, unfeeling Neanderthals who are motivated by ego and personal pleasure. It makes commitment look like impromptu-meeting scheduling and divorce look like a five-year-old quitting a board game. It sends terrible messages to people around the world about how we Americans perceive marital bonds and serious unions. For anyone willing to disagree, just take another look at the ending of the film, which is so soulless and cheap it's hard to believe it took five writers to concoct it and all the preceding events.The Heartbreak Kid is a comedy with a bad attitude, not the kind that is so uproariously funny and foul, but the kind of bad attitude that gets you sent upstairs with no dessert. It's another entry in the ever-growing genre of "maximum antics, minimum laughter," a term I coined to identify when comedies emphasize stupidity over wit so-much-so they forget that the antics should be funny and enjoyable to watch. The Farrelly brothers are two of the biggest names in comedy, with good films like Stuck on You and There's Something About Mary under their belt, but with The Heartbreak Kid they've made one of the hardest comedies to like, let alone tolerate, and sit-through of the last decade.Starring: Ben Stiller, Jerry Stiller, Malin ?kerman, Michelle Monaghan, Carlos Mencia, Rob Corrdry, and Danny McBride. Directed by: Bob Farrelly and Peter Farrelly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ben Stiller is no Charles Grodin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's no denying that this is another Farrelly Brothers' movie that is extremely crude and occasionally very funny. However, The Heartbreak Kid is not even in the same league as their best films. Too much of the humor falls flat and there's no essential humanity in the story. That's because the Farrellys built the entire story around an unsympathetic nonentity and then cast Ben Stiller in that hopeless, thankless role, almost as though they were getting back at him for something.Eddie (Ben Stiller) is 40 years old and is feeling the pressure from family, friends and society to finally get married. He meets a pretty blonde named Lila (Malin Ackerman) and after a whirlwind 6 weeks, they decide to tie the knot. As they honeymoon at a Mexican resort, Eddie sees an entirely new, annoying and crazy side to his bride. Realizing he can't stand his new wife, Eddie falls in with Miranda (Michelle Monaghan), a beautiful and funny woman who has no idea Eddie is a newlywed. She ends up thinking he's a widower whose wife was murdered with an ice pick. The truth eventually comes out, leading to an extended ending sequence that frankly seems to belong to a totally different film.There are some laugh-out-loud moments in The Heartbreak Kid, Michelle Monaghan is utterly charming and Malin Ackerman gets naked. All of that isn't enough to keep this whole production from being dragged down by the character of Eddie and a tired performance from Ben Stiller. To be blunt, Eddie is a stupid jackass and all of his problems are caused by him being a stupid jackass. It quickly becomes impossible to feel any sympathy for all the awkward and uncomfortable situations Eddie finds himself in because the awkwardness and uncomfortableness is entirely caused by Eddie being a stupid jackass. You can't feel sorry for Eddie when Lila turns out to be a flake or when Miranda abandons him after learning the truth because he's just getting what he deserves.And while it's possible for an unsympathetic character to still be hilarious, that almost always requires the story to acknowledge and even revel in the character's flaws. Whether it's Forgetting Sarah Marshall or Bad Santa, seeing pathetic people struggle with their own miserable selves can be very funny. There's nothing like that in The Heartbreak Kid.Ben Stiller also appears to be sleepwalking through this film. In fairness, he's played this same sort of role many times with much better scripts, but he's just so clearly skating by with the least amount of effort that it gets annoying.This movie isn't terrible. It's just blah.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly the screenplay has made this movie so bad. The cast is excellent, but the story is awful. I am fan of Ben Stiller's movies. Despite of it, "Heartbreak" is nothing if compared with other Stiller's masterpieces. Probably the screenplay has been adjusted while the movie was being made. Until the first half, the story flows well, but it looses its way and disappear in the end. Planning is very important, so it is necessary to pay attention on it. Maybe Ben didn't realize it; but he will pay attention now, I am sure.Hope to see the Ben we all know very well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I heard about this movie, I thought it could be something like "Duplex" at least. When I finally saw the movie, I knew I had just totally misunderstood it, well, not in a good way. The movie was really kind of weird. I couldn't be sure if the movie was trying to make me laugh or cry. Also the characters in the movie, I was not sure if I should like them or dislike them. It was totally not a typical Ben Stiller's movie. Seems the director was trying to make a balance to the movie between being funny and touching, but finally the movie was made neither funny nor touching. The movie also didn't make me feel comfortable since something in the movie made the movie quite unnatural. So if you actually expect a movie to make you feel happy, then do not go for it. If you expect a movie to touch your heart, then do not go for it either. This is really a movie which has totally wasted the talent of Ben Stiller. I have to say, the trailer of the movie really has got all of the best parts of the movie already! So go for it or not, you decide.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing remake of the 1972 hit film.To say, give me that old time religion is to put it mildly. Remember in the 1972 film when the distinct differences are shown between the Jewish and Christian girl? That important element is totally missing here and the film suffers for that and other problems as well.Gone is the stern WASP Eddie Albert character as the father-in-law. Jeannie Berlin's antics are not here and the plot becomes one of not being in the right place at the right time when it comes to meeting girls. How many times will Eddie and Miranda miss before they're finally available for each other? In short, the film becomes an absolute farce.Ben Stiller is no Charles Grodin and that's showing here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie really lacks heart. The subject may be like that. But they could have made it better. It looks to me, that the directors were really confused. One time they wanted to make a movie that keeps faith in marriage (the pillow scene) and another time, they wanted the movie to like reality. I mean, this guy knows that divorce is going to sting his pockets big time, and they do show him to be a bit of miser in couple of scene and yet he keeps spending. The vulgarity in the movie is appalling. I don't know why people would say that the directors tried to recreate the touch of "There's something about Mary" in this movie, because both are completely different. I hope they didn't, if so they failed miserably. This movie is more like "Along came Polly" (well that was at least funny) Laughs are not heavy in this movie. It's more like a grin-type comedy. Ben Stiller is the only good part of the movie. I have never thought any of his movies were boring, until this. But, he did his part really good. His acting is really good, and in scenes, where he shows his surprise at other's comment, he does it in his Stiller's way. Without him, this movie would have been a disaster.If you looking for a laugh out comedy, this is not movie for you. If you believe in marriage and love, this is not a movie for you. This is crude movie at its best (or should I say, at its worst).It's an appalling remake of a good comedy movie. 4/10</fullReview>

With tons of good dialogs, witty humor and great, smart ending. 8/10 for that part.Yes, it could. However, Farrelly brothers crossed the line -- they added some "spice" humor too, but they didn't stop there. They added (for a flavor?) some most disgusting, repelling, obscene "jokes" (completely unfunny) I've seen so far (and by all means I wish I will never make a new record) which are hard to watch and make you feel vomiting even day or two after. Lack of sense of humor, what to add and what to keep for themselves. If you are going to see this movie with some friends (don't do it with your family) make sure everybody is drunk in advance.Pity. Great potential wasted for good, memorable comedy, for which you want to come back and watch it again with pleasure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first 45 minutes of this movie were fun and hilarious, until they reach to a Mexican hotel, and then the base of the movie, which was the rivality between Stiller and Akerman, was destroyed, this also destroyed the film, because form a comedy it turns to a drama, and shows you Stiller as a Casanova, which leaves his new wife, sick and with her face bur for another girl who just met in the hotel. Then he get in love and tries to keep the relationship in secret. The first minutes were fun, because Akerman make everything possible to annoy Stiller, and it was fun to watch how a blond girl screw up a white hair men. When they got to Mexico the movie... went down. It should never been made this film, and by making the porno scenes, it seems that the brothers realize that their movie wouldn't work, so they should put on porno scenes, 'cause people like porno, and that's why this movie las like a month on cinemas, instead of lasting few days, because it deserves it. A shame for the brothers. I don't believe that are the same directors responsible of making "There's something about Mary". Unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Something (Nasty) About the Farrellys</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Eddie Cantrow, a forty-year-old bachelor, meets and falls for pretty and (seemingly) sweet young blonde named Lila. Under pressure from his friends and his sex-obsessed elderly father (played by Ben Stiller's own father Jerry), he marries her. Now there is a proverb which says "marry in haste, repent at leisure", and on their honeymoon in Mexico Lila suddenly turns from Eddie's ideal woman to the wife from hell. (She turns out to be nearly bankrupt, unemployed, a former drug addict and a devotee of rough sex with a crude and vulgar personality). Eddie decides that Lila is not, after all, the woman he wants to be married to. To make matters worse, he has just met the woman he does want to be married to, a pretty and sweet young brunette named Miranda who is in the resort for a family reunion. This leaves Eddie with two problems: how to stop Lila finding out about his new romance, and how to stop Miranda finding out that he is already married. Apart from "There's Something about Mary", also made by the Farrelly brothers, I was not previously familiar with Ben Stiller's work. On the basis of this film he would seem to be a gifted comic actor, but a comedian is only as good as his material and Stiller is given little to work with here. At the beginning of the film his character seems like a lovable schmuck, a loser in love who suddenly strikes it lucky. Unfortunately, Eddie's lovability suddenly evaporates when he falls for Miranda. It is difficult to regard as lovable, or even likable, a character who goes on honeymoon with one girl and ends up romancing another, without either of them being aware of the true situation. I would agree with the reviewer that there is a nasty misogynistic streak running through the film. The Farrellys obviously realised that if they were to stand any chance at all of making Eddie likable they would have to make Lila as detestable as possible in order to justify his treatment of her, and they certainly try hard to load the dice against her. Unfortunately, there is such a thing as trying too hard, and the louder the script screamed "Lila is a bitch!", the more I found myself sympathising with her and loathing Eddie. The other major female character, Miranda, is never anything more than a sweet and pretty plot device, never emerging as an individual in her own right. Women apart, there are plenty of others who are likely to be offended by "The Heartbreak Kid". Like Mexicans, who are portrayed in stereotypical terms either as mariachi musicians, or as illegal immigrants, or as people who have sex with donkeys. Or Southerners; Miranda's family (from Alabama) are a bunch of rednecked vulgarians. The work of the Farrelly brothers is often celebrated as "politically incorrect", but this is a phrase which can be misused. The expression "political incorrectness" implies a willingness to think for oneself, an admirable refusal to conform to received ideas, especially the received ideas of the Establishment, but it is too often used as a way of passing off crude and offensive, especially sexually or racially offensive, material as bold or free-thinking. With its stereotypes, its nasty attitude to women and its lavatorial humour, there is nothing either bold or free-thinking about "The Heartbreak Kid". It's just a gross comedy of the sort that Hollywood churns out with depressing regularity these days. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the horrible reviews I went to see this movie because: a) The trailer seemed really good and....... b) I was curious on somebody pulling off as preposterous an idea as somebody falling in love during their honeymoon without appearing monstrous. Big mistake ! The actual movie is to the trailer what the Lila character ends up being to what Ben Stiller originally thought it was: absolutely horrible. "Stuck on you" and "Shallow Hal" seemed like masterpieces compared to this piece of junk. It seems that the liberation of the PG-13 rating by the Farrellys only served to show them to be a couple of perverts. Their Jerry Stiller and Uncle Tito characters characters are appalling beyond belief and brings no laughs whatsoever. When the film reaches its final scenes you feel it would take a miracle for the Ben Stiller character to do something that saves him from looking like a total bastard, not only do the film-makers not achieve this but on the contrary, they make him end up worse than you could have possibly imagined. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes: the trailers looked funny, Ben Stiller can play that poor downtrodden troubled character with good freak-outs(even if that is all he can play, outside of caricatures like Zoolander). I even enjoyed it pleasantly up until the honeymoon. Then Eddie was a selfish, self-centered a**. Are we supposed to feel for him? Were we supposed to be horrified for him at the real woman he married? Maybe I missed the point, and we were supposed to think he was an a**. If so, then the Farrelly brothers missed the mark. Few laughs, no identification with any of the characters, the acting was adequate, certainly not one outstanding character. Martin had the most entertaining personality. And no, I am not disappointed in this movie because of the sex scenes (Eddie is a bore), the language or the slapstick humor-I am disappointed in the rest of it. Oh, and what was Carlos doing stooping to such as ridiculous use of his talents? Maybe the rest of his scenes got cut.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A guy with a problem with commitment decides to get married. He doesn't need much time for it either: a woman more or less drops into his life and looks a good enough shot to try and they get married. Love is a wicked game though and it doesn't take long before he finds out she isn't the one for him. And so far the start of the story of this "comedy".Now, comedy. That is a type of film that is supposed to make people laugh. To have them in stitches for a substantial amount of time during the film and maybe even after the film if it is really good. And that is where this film fails greatly. It manages to get the exact opposite done. The best bits of the film grant a small chuckle but the most of it grant nothing but yawns and bored irritation. It runs too long, too slow and with far too many far too long moments between laughs and simply rehashes too many of film industry jokes, and not in a good way.No. Not a worthy watch. Not worthy of the celluloid it was filmed on and surely not worth the time to sit through in a cinema.3 out of 10 very boring moments.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Farrelly's Return to Form...Not!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After 3 watered-down, toothless flicks (Shallow Hal, Stuck on You, and Fever Pitch), The Heartbreak Kid was The Farrelly Brothers' return to raunchy comedy. Trying to recapture the greatness of their biggest hit, There's Something about Mary, they hired Ben Stiller and a Cameron Diaz look-alike. The end result is heartbreakingly mediocre. The film, which tells the story of a newlywed (Stiller), whose bride (Akerman) goes loco only a couple of hours after their wedding, just isn't funny. In fact, all the good jokes were in the trailer. The remaining jokes either missed the mark (anything that has to do with Monaghan's Miranda), or were removed altogether from the Egyptian theatrical version (apparently, there's a hilarious love sequence). In addition, due to sloppy writing, I found myself rooting for the bad "guy" (Akerman's Lila), and thought Stiller's Eddie was a jerk, as he cheated on his wife during their honeymoon. If that wasn't enough, the film is far too long (over 2 hours) and the last 30 minutes are so dark for a "comedy" that they're painful to watch. The film's only redeeming factor is Akerman, who gives a charming performance. But even Akerman's charm can't save this trainwreck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts quite well, but then nosedives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Why do so many American filmmakers get things so wrong? That predilection is all too obvious in Hollywood's habit of remaking previously successful comedies, such as Welcome To Collinwood, and coming up with a distinctly second-rate copy. That might seem like a generalisation and it is certainly provocative, but I suggest it really is a valid question. In other spheres - and I'll admit this is a personal view, although I'm admitting it purely in the interests of diplomacy - the U.S. exhibits similar traits. In cooking it's highest achievement and most certainly one of the 'national dishes' for which it is known worldwide is the hamburger, so no points there. Whereas most other nations go for quality, the U.S. is apparently more interested in quantity: the tallest, the biggest, the heaviest, the loudest, the longest - all are intended to impress the rest of the world and all never do. What has this to do with The Heartbreak Kid? Well, to me it seems a case in point. The film isn't exactly bad, but it isn't very good either. There are the obvious, usually very crude, jokes and the targets are easy. The premise of the film, the plot if you like, is promising, but for some odd reason the film takes the wrong turn every time. There are some neat points which are simply thrown away: the golden bride who turns into the bride from hell is a good one, but in these hands it is simply wasted. There is some promising misunderstanding, but nothing is really made of it. The opening credits proclaim that the screenplay - by no less than five writers, and boy does it show - was based on a Neil Simon play. Based perhaps, but a million miles from the wit which Simon habitually makes his own. In some ways it comes down to what might be described as a lack of taste. My claim might sound arch to American ears and lead me to accusations of being just another European snob looking down his nose at the U.S. Well, if that's your point of view, I'll have to accept it, but I do sincerely believe that a national American failing - and, in film terms, Hollywood's Achilles heel - is just that: a lack of taste shading off all too rapidly in extreme crassness. That is not to say it happens all the time, and I am the first to defend the Americans when it is claimed that 'they don't have a sense of irony': nonsense, some do - look at Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, the film U Turn and many others. It's just that those with that gift seem sadly to be in a minority. The very last scene in The Heartbreak Kid sums up just how off kilter the whole exercise is: when finally things come right for Ben Stiller's character and Miranda turns up hoping to rekindle what they had - a plot development which is shoehorned in so crassly that it could only be in an American film - Stiller is confronted by his new wife, presented is being rather nice this time, and gives her the same old spiel about 'we've got to talk'. And, friends, this is regarded as a joke. Well, not in my universe it isn't. One symptom is the obvious sloppiness in the screenplay, the silly contrivances, the unconvincing plot lines, the caricature characterisation. Lila, the wife of nightmares, is never seen again and we are merely told Stiller divorced her and lost his sports store to her in the settlement. Fair enough, but that is sixth-form writing. It's as though the producers just couldn't be bothered giving the punter a proper film. One for a very rainy day. Starts well, but falls off a cliff long before the end.</fullReview>

The basic story of a guy (Stiller) meets a girl has a whirlwind romance that ends up in a wedding only to find out on honeymoon that his new wife is not the person he thought she was. Thrown in to the mix is him ending up meeting another woman on honeymoon. Now this works okay for the most and the movie gets better as it progress' but I was reaching for the remote a lot early in th e movie checking how much viewing time was remaining. Also the Farrelly's are much crasser here than normal and this does not always work. Especially in the case of Stiller's coarse father. So stick with the movie for the laughs come towards the end.

Who would later be his wife after a short 2 months of knowing her.Anyway I don't want to get too much into this movie, but lets say what hes in for is a honeymoon from hell, or maybe heaven.This movie uses the romantic comedy genre much differently than a lot of other movies.Its not a GREAT comedy, one that will have you laughing uncontrollably, but its still a good one with several awkward laughs.What is weird is, this movie is good in many ways, acting is great, script is alright (could have been better). And the movie gets a bit repetitive near the end (but not at all boring). But I still felt that I should give it only a 6, its not about what it did have, its just how it had it.Its not a movie that you'd watch a lot of, although I did watch it twice in two days, that is probably all I'd watch from it.

I mean that not because I think this should have been a sweet romantic comedy, rather that its so bad that not even the low brow humor works.Ben Stiller kind of sort of almost pulls it off, but the shifting of tone just derails the whole thing. (Coming from me, a man who normally hates Ben Stiller this is high praise.) Then again any film that makes Jerry Stiller just vulgar instead of vulgar but funny isn't to be bothered with.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even if you have some time to kill, think again - it's not worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie on a longer business flight within Canada. Even if there was not much to do on that evening flight, and the idea of a comedy appealed to me, this 'comedy' is so bad I was sorry I spent the time to see it instead of dousing... Here it goes: the characters are under-developed, the plot borders the ridiculous, and some of the scenes where you're supposed to laugh are quite disgusting. Ben Stiller's acting as the new husband Eddie is OK, however the screenplay doesn't help him. His new wife Lila, played by the beautiful Malin Akerman, who is supposed to become unbearable during their honeymoon trip to Mexico as the plot went on, looked quite charming to me as she was singing along to the radio and only Eddie's grumpiness signaled me that I was not supposed to like her. Then things go from bad to worse, with the new husband getting into an affair with another woman in no time - so much for a romantic honeymoon, with Eddie's annoying father Doc, played by Ben Stiller's real father Jerry Stiller, giving him advice geared on having sex and more sex... well, enough said. This movie couldn't have been any worse and it is not the pride of Farrelly Brothers. I haven't paid to go see this movie and I still feel bad for the time I wasted on it. If you want to go and see it, good enough, I've given you a fair warning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly and misogynistic. What happened to the Farrelly Brothers?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's way too bad about the Farrelly Brothers. It looked like they were going to be the great comedians of modern cinema after their first three films, Dumb &amp; Dumber, Kingpin and There's Something about Mary, but all of their subsequent films have been disappointments. Me, Myself and Irene, Shallow Hal, Stuck on You and Fever Pitch were all decent movies, but none of them had the cojones of their first three. They seemed to be getting sweeter, which wouldn't be such a bad thing if they didn't also lose their edge. Well, their new film, The Heartbreak Kid, proves that their edge is completely dulled. Where they were able to combine a certain humanity with the gross-out jokes in a film like There's Something about Mary, it now feels like they are just desperately cramming them into The Heartbreak Kid. None of the dirty jokes work. They're all groan-inducing. Nothing seems more out of place than a Tijuana donkey show. The incongruity of it all isn't even what ruins the movie, unfortunately. It's the way they treat women, or at least one woman, Malin Akerman. Man, does this movie come off as misogynistic. I'm guessing that, in the original film, written by Neil Simon, there's more insight into how bad a person the protagonist is (there played by Charles Grodin, here by the every day more dire Ben Stiller). It doesn't feel like there's much insight into Stiller's character, and I think we're actually supposed to like him and root for him to get into a relationship with the "good girl", here played by Michelle Monaghan. In the end (and especially in the end, given the final twist of the film), I hated the guy. Akerman comes off as nasty, but Stiller's character doesn't even deserve to get peed on by her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>avoid this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Normally I am able to find some quality in a film that at least allows me to justify the money and time spent watching it. Not this time. The first half or so of the movie had promise, it could have been a sweet romantic comedy about the difficulties of getting married, the problems all couples go through when they turn their two separate lives into one... it was a cohesive story. When the other woman was brought into the story it all fell apart, I am not complaining about the concept, there is possibility in that, but it was so poorly delivered in this movie that the whole was awful. It had the feel of two scripts being forced together with a hammer and chisel. Stiller never should have made this film. I hope it is not a sign of things to come.I wish I could get my money, and more importantly, my time, back.</fullReview>

Ugly choice of words. Should have walked out of the theater then and demanded my money back. Unfortunately, I stayed, hoping for improvement. Not so lucky. Instead, the negative images continued. If you are married with children, you are hen-pecked. If you are newly married, you made a grave mistake. While on your honeymoon, you can meet the person of your dreams. Ugly. What kind of message is this? No thanks. Without giving away the ending, let's just say that everyone lost one way or the other. No morality. No purpose. No ethics. No point. No redeeming quality. No humor(unless you like slap-stick). No winning. No lesson learned. No nothing. What a waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure the new raunchy Farrelly Brothers movie 'The Heartbreak Kid' is stupid and disgusting, but one thing it is not is sappy. In an age where most comedies with a romantic angle have a sweet sentimental side, 'The Heartbreak Kid' is completely free o...(read more)f that. It's insensitive, gross and completely unpretentious. But that doesn't mean it's good. While side-splittingly funny at some parts, a great deal of the film swings and misses with it's jokes. Ben Stiller is very funny playing the emasculate pussy he always plays and Malin Akerman is adequate in her role. The rest of the cast is decent with the exception of Carlos Mencia who overplays his part so much he becomes annoying. As far as Farrelly Brothers go 'Heartbreak Kid' is certainly not on par with 'There's Something About Mary', 'Kingpin' and 'Dumb and Dumberer', but certainly better than 'Stuck on Me'. I recommend 'The Heartbreak Kid' to someone wanting to see a gross-out comedy lacking in plot. Grade: C+</fullReview>

His father is crude and extremely unfunny and even the normally brilliant Carlos Mencia is relegated to a single bland catch phrase "Screw Off I'm joking." It just goes to show that raunchy humor and nudity can only go so far to save a horrible screenplay.My advice - stay away from this movie at all costs.

It has a few funny moments, but that doesn't make up for the boring, played out nonsense that is the 45 minute gaps between funny scenes. The story is bad, the acting is sub-par, and quite frankly, I was trying to figure out ways to get my money back half way through the film. To go further, they shorten the funny scenes, and make the played out, annoying romance scenes way too long. Yes, there is nudity...but the nudity is not worth the money.And if you do go to see it, though I don't know why you would, watch out for the highly unoriginal scenes that will remind you of romantic comedies that have come out in the past 5 years.

		<fullReview>I'll start off by saying Ben Stiller and Malin Akerman where the perfect miss match couple in this film and Michelle Monahgan and Mr.Stiller where the Perfect Match as a couple!! I find people tend too judge movies to harshly on the basis it has to be profound in someway. Well, this movie isn't anymore then it's suppose to be and that's funny and charming. I found everyone played there parts perfectly and they all just had the connection they were meant to have with each other. Malin Akerman played the Sweet girl in the beginning so well and then later on played the crazy chick even better!! What I found awesome to was the transition from sweet to total nightmare, It just was so effortless. Overall I love this movie! It puts a smile on my face every time I watch it. It also has a good message and that's to never marry someone with out getting to know them, Get to know the girl you think you love and to not let your friends talk you into something you're not fully sure on... I'd recommend it to anyone who enjoys comedy's, especially Ben Stiller's !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's difficult to not compare The Heartbreak Kid to Forgetting Sarah Marshall, and it doesn't do well in that comparison. The latter outperforms the former in nearly every possible way. Ben Stiller isn't at his funniest here, but he does manage to do OK in a few funny moments. Michelle Monaghan was the bright spot for me, she is a great young actress and handles romantic comedies just as well as she does any other genre of movie.Ultimately, The Heartbreak Kid just isn't as funny as it should have been. There were only a few laugh out loud scenes, and there were long stretches of the movie that were just boring. The story was as predictable as possible, and none of the actors really seemed to be trying that hard. Rob Corddry, Carlos Mencia, Jerry Stiller, Danny McBride...they're all just doing the exact same bits that you've seen them do before. I have to admit that Mencia was kinda funny, though. And as far as the R rating goes, it doesn't really add much to the comedy. There's some nudity, sex, and cursing, but none of that makes the movie any funnier/better. Sure, I'm not gonna complain about seeing Malin Akerman's goods, but if that's your reason for seeing this movie, you'd do better to track down her scenes from Entourage. You're guaranteed to have a better time watching those.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie to be hysterical! I didn't even realize it existed until 2011. I was up late one night and I came across The Heartbreak Kid on one of my movie channels. Since it had Stiller in the film, i thought i'd give it a look. Next thing i know, i couldn't turn it off because i was laughing so hard. I laughed till i cried during certain parts. Few days later, i went and purchased the DVD. In 2014, i began putting together an extensive Blu-ray collection and I made sure that there were certain Farrely Bros films in my library. Those movies included, Dumb &amp; Dumber, Me Myself &amp; Irene, Kingpin, Something about Mary, Fever Pitch &amp; Heartbreak Kid. I drew a lot of parallels from the HBK flick because I experienced an eerily similar situation in a past relationship. I was pretty surprised when I saw some reviews on this movie. Perhaps if those individuals had an experience similar to mine, they'd see the real humor in it, as I do. Then again, maybe it's just me. ;)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A little funny but with some cruel scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A tip for the producers... people who like to laugh don't normally consider watching painful scenes as something conducive to humor. :-)I personally thought that her getting sunburned was an unnecessary part to the whole story and even the inclusion of "another woman" in the whole thing... it would have been really funny on its own to just watch his whole interaction with Lila with him not knowing her well enough and all the quirks that go along with that. Bringing the other girl into the scene and then even the girl at the end of the movie made it more into a "drama" than a comedy and people were at the edge of their seat hoping he would not get caught and squirming when he did and the girls were heartbroken. Not to mention the whole jelly fish scene... ewwww... gross! I literally wanted to leave the theater gagging when I saw that one with that ugly horrible clingy thing hanging from his back knowing how painful it must've been... I don't think anyone hated Ben Stiller's character THAT much to warrant something like that. Sorry...not impressed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entertaining and fun, all the way through! And with a really great soundtrack too. It starts out looking like a typical romantic comedy, but I think it's not. The humor is a little bit darker, smarter and less cuddly. I'm almost prepared to give it an 8.So why do so many dislike? Well I think people mistook it for another cuddly romantic comedy. It's not. And some think that the characters are unlikeable. Well they are not. Eddie, Stiller's main character, is trying to do the right thing - all the time. He just happens to have a pushy and whimsical father (spot on by Jerry Stiller) that makes him not always make the right choices. And there is some bad timing involved. This is what could have happened to any of us!Some say that the girl wasn't that bad, she didn't deserve what happened. Well maybe not, but she wasn't too innocent either. It wasn't just the small things, it was the combination of all of it, all stacked together, and her attitude on top of it. It's okay when people are not super smart, but when dumb and with bad attitude, ignorance and perhaps a hint of manipulative, it's not good.And the way some women tend to mentally disturb their husbands and they just let it happen to avoid further domestic trouble, it's so sad but not too far from reality. Women should stop henpecking their men. Be kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid (2007): Dir: Bobby Farrelly, Peter Farrelly / Cast: Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan, Malin Akerman, Jerry Stiller, Danny McBride: Diverse comedy about false security associated with marriage. Ben Stiller finally gets married but he must deal with his wife's bad habits. To further complicate matters he falls for another woman while on the honeymoon. Directed by Peter and Bobby Farrelly whose best films include Kingpin and There's Something About Mary. Their style of humour is generally vulgar but they also delivery of characters viewers may identify with. Stiller plays the frustrated husband whose ideal woman isn't what he thought. He is unsympathetic in his new relationship that is based around deceit. Malin Akerman steals scenes as his annoying nagging bride who is bedridden with a skin rash. Her final scene is embarrassing but she plays it with full gusto. Michelle Monaghan is Stiller's new fixation celebrating her parents' wedding vows. She is down to earth but headed for a deceptive relationship. Jerry Stiller plays Stiller's father who urges his son to get married. It is a straightforward role but the relating actors look good together. Danny McBride steals moments as Monaghan's cousin who verbally abuses Stiller on sight. Vulgar humour highlights the blessings and curses of relationships and other potential heartbreaks. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller, Michelle Monaghan, Malin Akerman and Jerry Stiller star in this 2007 comedy remake of the 1972 film. Stiller (Zoolander) plays bachelor, Eddie who hasn't found the right woman yet. Ackerman (Couples Retreat) plays Lila, an attractive woman he soon meets and dates. After 6 weeks, Eddie decides to marry her and they go to Mexico for their honeymoon. Soon, Eddie learns he may have made a mistake when Lila is not whom he expected. Eddie secretly finds romance with another woman, Miranda (Monaghan) who eventually learns he's married. The Farrelly Brothers directed this and previously worked with Stiller in "There's Something About Mary." Stiller's father, Jerry (The King of Queens) naturally plays his on screen father, Doc and Danny McBride (Pineapple Express), Scott Wilson (The Walking Dead) &amp; Polly Holliday (Gremlins) also appear.

His friend Mac (Rob Corddry) is an annoying jerk. Lila (Malin Akerman) gets robbed by a purse snatcher and Eddie tries to help. They start dating. When her environmental research job forces her to Rotterdam, he decides to keep her in San Francisco by marrying her after only 6 weeks of dating. They go to Cabo for the honeymoon. Soon he discovers all her craziness and he starts questioning his decision. While in Cabo, Eddie falls Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) and he has to break off with Lila while trying to keep the truth from Miranda. Her cousin Martin (Danny McBride) doesn't trust him at all.Ben Stiller is trying to be the everyman. Malin Akerman is flailing away too much. It's like dying from a thousand different cuts. It doesn't make Ben Stiller any more likable. He comes off as shallow with every twitch at Akerman's craziness and every lie he tells. Michelle Monaghan is perfectly nice but Malin Akerman was perfectly nice before the Farrellys got through with her.The Farrelly brothers are missing something in this. I think it's missing a good heart. The main problem is that every character is an annoying outlandish cartoon. Even the nice people are annoyingly unlikeable. That's not necessary and rather distracting. There are some funny moments. Some of the wacky Farrelly brothers jokes actually work. The overall story doesn't work that well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now let's be honest when you talk about remakes, it tends to be a load of tosh which within a few weeks evaporates from sight after being released never to be heard of again; unfortunately this is no exception. However when money's involved made from the box office - due to a handsome cast and a trailer that actually does take the funniest parts out of the movie to cram in within a couple of minutes; it's unlikely to bother the distributor's how unfunny and a waste of money the movie is.Don't get me wrong though not all remakes are bad, Peter Jackson did it with LOTR and King Kong and Daniel Craig proved to be an excellent Bond in the Casino Royale remake. But Heartbreak Kid just doesn't make the best of the cast it has. Stiller and Akerman prove to be funny when they get the chance to shine (look out for these, if you blink you will probably miss them) but there is few moments when we can really appreciate how much there is to enjoy about this movie.Admittedly it isn't terrible, Stiller was well cast as the-guy-who-married-a-psycho-and-is-regretting-it-big-time type of role but he doesn't get the one liners or gags he deserves. Akerman makes up for this being the girlfriend from hell but we only scratch the surface of her insanity which is a shame because boy is she crazy. So if you really haven't got anything to do and want to stretch out a couple of hours watch this for the few laughs it does provide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A change of plan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Something definitely happened to the Farrelly brothers' remake of the funnier, and wittier 1972 version of the original Elaine May film. They might have thought they had a sure winner with their take, but unfortunately, they had no luck with the way they handled the basic premise of the story.Neil Seimon turned Bruce Jay Friedman's book "A Change of Plan" into an acerbic satire of the times in which the original film appeared. Gone are in the Farrelly's version the humor, the perverse fun, and the irony of the original concept. Part of the blame should go to their choice of leading man. Don't get me wrong, Ben Stiller is a good actor and comedian, but he needs a strong hand behind him. The Farrellys let their star do what appears to be his new repertoire of rants and raves he has developed lately.Compare Mr. Stiller to the stellar performance Charles Grodin brought to the role. Basically, Lenny, in the original film, was a Jewish kid that is dazzled by the Waspish beauty of Kelly Corcoran. She is no match for the Jewish girl he ended up marrying. Lila Kolodny has nothing, in comparison, going for her. In that aspect the old movie makes more sense than in the new one.The Farrellys use of grossness is somewhat tamed in their film. There are only a few occasions in which they stoop low, like toward the end of the picture in the jelly fish sequence. Otherwise, much of their humor doesn't quite make it. We are not opposed to watching sequels, although we prefer to stick to originality any day, but the Farrellys have done better films of this genre.Malin Akerman, who is seen as Lila in the 2007 remake, is a good actress, who could pass for Cameron Diaz's twin. Michelle Monagham has better luck with her take of Miranda. Jerry Stiller, the star's father repeats his real life role in this film with some mild results.Cabo San Lucas looks great!</fullReview>

(u feel like actually going there for ur next vacation). 2. a cute yet totally killed-off-for-the-storyline act by 'laila'. 3. finished.u see my point...that pretty much sums up the total positive points for the movie. now some, rather many cons.CONS - 1. no writing whatsoever. people keep getting married, splitting up for no genuine reason whatsoever(not really trying to find some logic in a comedy but some sense should prevail). 2. not-at-all good lines. now, ben stiller is funny, as we all know. but he gets nothing from the writers and all his eyebrow-clinching, serious-face funniness just loses all its charm and u r left wondering if its the same actor. 3. no spark. one doesn't feel the connection between 'miranda' and 'edward' thanks to very less screen time given to them together (although miranda has got some seriously bewitching eyes). 4. 'laila' whose shown as a looney girl comes off much better than 'miranda' does. she's (in my humble opinion) much hotter, cuter, funny, spontaneous and experienced (in the bed and life in general) than 'miranda'. one wonders why doesn't this guy fall even harder for 'laila'. i would. 5. very average music... the songs don't really create the scenes and not a single one is taken back by the viewer. 6. last but not the least movies like these survive on the nudity, crass but funny lines, hot girls and some good editing. this movie has none of these. all in all, would i recommend this movie to you? well, if u r bored, love ben stiller (but wanna see him embarrass himself with his movie choice), like to see Mexico's famous toursit resorts, then u just might see it. for all others, don't see it plz. my rating :- 2.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misplaced sympathies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the original Charles Grodin / Cybill Shepherd many years ago, but not very clearly, so I start here by looking at this movie in its own light.The movie's premise is that the main character marries in haste due to pressure from family and friends (because he is still unmarried and has reached his 40s), only to make two appalling discoveries on arriving at his honeymoon hotel: one, his new bride is a dreadful mistake and, two, the girl he should have married (but has only just met) is staying at the hotel.The only problem lies with a central misconception in the Farrelly brothers treatment of this situation: Lila, the dreadful mistake, isn't a dreadful mistake. Malin Akerman's Lila is gorgeous, determinedly cheerful, aggressively sexual, and as prone to quirky individualities as anyone - but, importantly, no more so. Ben Stiller's Eddie, however, is familiar to anyone who has seen a few Stiller movies. He is the mildly neurotic, somewhat cranky individual who Stiller plays so well. And, to be perfectly frank, my sympathies were firmly with Lila. She clearly loves Eddie, she is a person who moves positively forward, she is prepared to make accommodations in her relationship with him, and she doesn't deserve the disgraceful treatment she gets from him.For similar reasons, I was puzzled at why Michelle Monaghan's Miranda is so taken with him.The performances were good, the film was colourful and cheery, and had a sprinkling of good laughs, both young women are very photogenic (and it must be said that Malin Akerman is very hot indeed), but the fact that any sympathies I had for the protagonist evaporated early on meant that the film did not proceed towards an ending I wanted.And, while I appreciated the twist at the end, it simply reinforced what I was already feeling.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been a long time since we've seen Ben Stiller in such a crass and raunchy comedy. This movie is far more dirty than There's Something About Mary, which was terrific. This movie is no where near as good. It had a few laughs but the bad language, especially by Eddie's father, and the very raunchy sex scenes were a turn off. I wasn't expecting those 2 things in a Ben Stiller comedy. This movie is definitely not for 15 year olds. Another thing is this movie wants to make Eddie out as the good guy, but how can you when he's on his honeymoon and on the prowl for the first cute girl he meets, Miranda. He tells some big lies to his wife, Lila, instead of just saying he thinks the marriage was a mistake.This movie just didn't seem like it fit Ben Stiller. He just seems to nice to be playing a jerk and cussing a lot. Also the talk between him and his real father was quite "something".FINAL VERDICT: I didn't think it was that funny. Not really worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake with much to offend just about anybody.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not nearly as good -- or as focused -- as the original, this remake often falls into the trap of relying on obscene language as a substitute for intelligent dialog. Melin Akerman is a nightmare, but pales by comparison to Elaine May. Actually in some ways her role plays well, by letting the nightmare trickle out slowly while Elaine May's hit the viewer in the face.With something to offend virtually everyone, this comes from a troop of Hollywood Liberals who undoubtedly subscribe to Political Correctness except when they're the ones dishing out insults.Having said that, I think either version of The Heartbreak Kid is a MUSE SEE for anyone (man or woman) planning on marrying anytime soon -- or ever. For that matter, anyone intending to date, have coffee with, or even smile at another person with romance in mind.The original Heartbreak Kid was a big hit; while the remake sank like a brick. No doubt the coke sniffers in Hollywood have turned that around in their own minds in the usual manner: Movie prices today are $10 to $11 but in the 1970's they were $1.05 to $3.00. Thus the deck is stacked for the newer film to always win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's very interesting the way great comedians starts their careers with great movies and than accept to work on so-so or bad movies and then in great movies again. It's a strange repetitive circle. It's not different with Ben Stiler.The problem with this movie is that it's just average funny. It has a nice basic plot but it wasn't explored to the bone,but only superficially. Most jokes are silly and weak exploring sexual content. Note I'm not against sexual content jokes but it need to be clever ones to be good.I think it's a nice movie for a lazy rainy Saturday afternoon but it's just it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No clear comedic direction, awful ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the criticisms have been made in the previous 10 pages of comments. This movie attempts to merge the sensibilities of a Neil Simon script with the raunchy hijinx of _Something About Mary_. The result is a predictable mishmash that is barely funny most of the time.The worst sin is that Eddie becomes less and less likable as the movie goes on. Lila is supposed to be the monster but by the end of it all I was sympathizing with her and just shaking my head at Eddie. In a final desperate attempt to shock a laugh out of the viewer, Eddie (in patented Ben Stiller fashion) appears to have learned his lesson, taken stock of his life, and turned his life around. Do yourself a favor. When Miranda shows up at the end, hit the stop button when she leaves and pretend like the last sixty seconds of the movie doesn't exist.The "twist" that follows turns what might have been a sweet ending into an indictment of Eddie's character that is supposed to be a laugh-out-loud surprise but instead just left me asking "What kind of asshat is this guy, anyway?" I wanted the Farrelly Brothers to refund the last two hours of my life afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am normally not too picky when it comes to comedies such as this. I can suspend my belief for any sort of movie and don't care for realism. If I want realism, I'll watch a documentary. With that in mind, I went into this movie with not too many expectations.What really got to me was the need to make this into a Rated R movie. I don't normally care about such things, but the bit of extra profanity and brief nudity didn't add to any of the comedic moments in my opinion. To me, it seemed that the pacing of the movie wasn't done very well at all. The jokes weren't over the top enough to be very funny and I only had a few genuine laughs scattered throughout the entire movie.I'm a fan of brainless comedies such as this, I absolutely enjoyed, "There's Something About Mary". However, this one really lacked anything to keep me wanting to keep watching. Ben Stiller was his usual quirky self, I didn't have a problem with his character. It's the supporting cast that I can't really say that I was very fond of. I didn't genuinely like any of the other characters in the movie say for maybe Uncle Tito.This movie might be good enough for a brainless evening with a huge bucket of popcorn. If you must see it, then rent it, this movie probably isn't going to be good enough for most people to want to have a second viewing. I'd have to say that you may only wish to purchase this if you are an absolute die-hard Ben Stiller fan, other than that, save your twenty-five bucks and rent it instead, or buy it on PPV.Average to just below-average for me, I'm stuck in the middle at five stars and that's being honestly generous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There's Nothing About the Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The irreverent Farrelly Brothers latest project is taken from the well made, excellently acted 72 comedy/drama of the same name. They have chosen wisely to avoid the more serious aspects of the original and apply their unique brand of frat house humor. Unwisely, they decided to make this movie. The humor is forced and the gross jokes no longer shockingly hilarious now that we have known the brothers MO for some time. They've lightened up on the carnival sideshow acts in Kid but the movie still telegraphs its punches. "Mary" was fresh, original and one of the best comedies of its day. Since then it's mostly been the same predictable stuff. They need to hail another Mary soon or follow the inevitable route already driven by comedy auteur ranging from the Airplane and Police Academy franchises to Woody Allen and Mel Brooks.Ben Stiller reprises his Something About Mary performance as he does in most of his films and it's starting to become very tiresome. His father Jerry Stiller is horribly miscast as his father. Michele Monahghan is an appealing love interest and first wife played by Leslie Dixon is quite flexible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a dreadful film. A man hurriedly marries a woman he finds attractive. During the honeymoon he finds there are things about her that he does not like. He falls for another woman.There is nothing to like about this film and plenty to dislike. The characters lack any dimension that leads us to feel sympathy for them. There are many horrid scenes and language that I suppose some might take as 'comedy'- but are just indicators of how far the film's perpetrators have come towards forgetting what comedy is. These characters are whining, amoral, trashy, superficial. Everything is stereotypical - from Mexico to Mississippi. The dialogue is ghastly, self-centred, American. Actually I couldn't bear to watch it to the end - though I doubt the last 30 minutes were going to be any different.Vile, repulsive and worthless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heartbreak kid -</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't quite worked out why I enjoyed this movie so so much. I stumbled upon it on sky TV late on a Sunday night just as i was about to go to bed, when my expectations were low. I could immediately see that this was typical stiller being stiller - bright, questioning and eager to please but in a kind of lost " I haven't quite arrived where I should be" kind of way. You know what you get with Stiller and he drew me in in the same way a TV premiership game would if I stumbled on it. But the sports shop pants scene cemented my relationship with this film and despite it being gone midnight on a Sunday night i knew from that moment i was in for the whole haul. Maybe it reminded me of situations I have been in in the past and strangely made me feel young again ( I am 46). But most of all , it made me laugh out loud more than I can remember for a long time. The bed scenes were the comedy climax for me - but again, sadly for me, they struck a huge chord with me. Of course it made light of marriage but crap happens and despite the fact that nobody breaks it off so soon (during the honeymoon) and there had to be poetic licence here for the film to work, it was strangely convincing - the transformation of this girl through the eyes of Stiller's character was perfectly done - even though all of the instances were individually harmless assuming you are happy with a doting, fun loving and attractive but slightly intellectually and emotionally immature wife. We can all be fickle and we all make allowances and compromises in life. Miranda represented the perfect match for Stiller. Was Stiller going to compromise or attempt to compromise after he realised his mistake? Miranda gave the movie some emotional backbone but I could not help thinking what lay beneath that positive earthy exterior - did you see the scary look on her face when she was mad in the bedroom scene.The one scene that nearly did not work was the jelly fish scene - but even that redeemed itself and brought a laugh with her line - we are on our honeymoon. The supporting cast were terrific. Stiller senior got some terrific lines and delivered as only he can. The sports shop pants scene was perfect as was the penultimate scene driving away from Miranda's house.I thought the final scene worked well and provided an unexpected comedy climax.</fullReview>

His wife Lila was a lovely lady. In fact I would say goodbye to my wife in order spend a heavenly night with her. Oven cooked and creamy, or not.I just could not get over this fact. I am married, I did not know my wife that long before I married her, we have had difficult times but I would kill myself before treating her like Stiller treated the beautiful Lila.I understand the point of the movie but it left me so cold. To me it is an irrelevance without laughs. If it was an irrelevance with laughs I would have a different opinion.The movie started of really well and sagged horribly in the middle.

		<shortDescription>Dull and dumb retread of a classic movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ant resemblance between this movie and its 1972 predecessor is purely coincidental. This movie appropriated a title that more appropriately should have been named The Heartburn Kid. Ben Stiller is no Charles Grodin and the other actresses are no Cybil Shepherd or Jeannie Berlin. The movie's story borders on the depressing and none of the scenes are funny. At times this movie is on the brink of becoming a tragedy. However, the movie did have potential of becoming a good drama about a man who doesn't want to knuckle under the domination of women and pays the price by being lonely and being the object of ridicule. However, this type of theme is not the stuff that comedies are made of, as this movie aptly proves. And what's even more pathetic is that the main character, the "heartburn" kid, moves FROM San Francisco, arguably one of the world's most picturesque cities in the world, where he OWNS a large sporting good store, to a resort hotel in Mexico where he miraculously seems to finally find personal happiness as a beach entrepreneur associating with "locals" who play jokes on him. None of this is funny. The quest for personal happiness is a serious subject, and Ben Stiller's character is too shallow and too stupid to lend itself to such introspection. What is most ridiculous about this movie however is its nasty and totally unfunny portrayal of Mr. Stiller's character's wife as some kind of eccentric control freak, when it seems that all she wanted was to have fun, sing and have a lot a sex. And when she gets sunburned, that would have been a great time for the Stiller character to show his wife some TLC, such as a nice, gentle massage, touching all the right places and then give her the "banging" that she not only wanted but expected. Now THAT would have a welcomed addition to this dull and dumb movie. The only reason I rate this movie a "2" is because of Jerry Stiller. Now HE would have been a great "heartbreak kid."</fullReview>

The remake of The Heartbreak Kid stars Ben Stiller, single Eddie who owns a sport shop. Eddie runs into Lila (Malin Akerman), whose purse gets snatched in the street. Eddie unsuccessfully tries to retrieve the purse but in turn he and Lila strike up a serious romance and Lila seems like she is perfect for him. At the announcement of a job she wants to take in Holland, Eddie looks into the matter and discovers the company policy of not relocating married employees, so; at his best friend (Rob Corrdry) and father 's (Jerry Stiller) urging, Eddie proposes and they get married. On their honeymoon, Eddie begins to feel that he made a mistake. To make matters worse, Eddie meets Miranda (Michelle Monaghan).I watched this one on the big screen (by myself as usual). - Asif Zamir</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough Humor To Keep Us Entertained</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid is a romantic comedy film directed by the Farrelly brothers.It stars Ben Stiller and Malin ?kerman.The film is a remake of the Italian film Luna di miele in tre and a version of the 1972 Elaine May comedy of the same title. Michelle Monaghan, Jerry Stiller, and Carlos Mencia play key supporting roles. The screenplay was written by Leslie Dixon, Scot Armstrong, the Farrelly brothers and Kevin Barnett.When 40-year-old San Francisco bachelor Eddie Cantrow attends the wedding of his ex-fiancée and is seated at a table of single people full of children,he then realizes maybe he's been too picky in his love life, and it's time to settle down. Fortunately, he doesn't have to compromise his standards when he meets Lila, a funny, attractive blond who does environmental research for a living. Lila's company wants to relocate her to Europe, but only because she's single.They don't force married couples to uproot themselves. So Eddie hastily proposes to her, even though they've only been dating for six weeks. But the moment they exchange vows, Eddie starts to notice Lila's rough edges and annoying habits, which had remained hidden underneath her perfect exterior. Their Cabo San Lucas honeymoon gets off to a rough start full of tuneless pop singalongs and surprising revelations about Lila's job and her past. Things only get worse for a confused Eddie when he meets Miranda, a Midwesterner in Cabo for a family reunion and starts to wish he'd held out just a little bit longer.Despite some amiable performances, The Heartbreak Kid is neither as daring nor as funny as the Farrelly Brothers' other films.And although it is not as engaging, there is enough humor to keeps us entertained.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was nine years since the Farrelly Brothers, Bobby and Peter, directed There's Something About Mary with the leading star, and they reunited for this comedy remake. Basically forty-year-old sporting goods store owner Eddie Cantrow (Ben Stiller) is still single, and is forced to watch his ex-fiancée walk down the aisle. Then he meets what seems to be the perfect woman in beautiful environmental researcher Lila (Malin ?kerman), and they do everything together. Pressured by his father Doc (Ben's real father, Jerry Stiller) and best friend Mac (Rob Corddry), Eddie decides that they are so perfect together that he and Lila marry after only six weeks together. But then all the sudden the problems begin when they set off on their honeymoon to Cabo, when Lila comes out with her immaturity, foolishness, unbearable snoring, owing money, and not having a real paid job. When Lila becomes severely sun-burnt and forced to rest, Eddie spends some time away from her, and he meets down-to-earth lacrosse coach Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) who is visiting her family. He begins to realise that he rushed his marriage too quickly, and of course he is falling for this new woman, and breaking up with crazy Lila is going to be tricky. Eddie tries a little gentleness to break the marriage, but it is interrupted, and the unknowing Miranda finds out the truth in the worst way possible. So Eddie hitches many long distance rides to get back to America, with no wife and no new love, but don't worry, before the end he starts a new sports business abroad, and he finds Miranda again, while with another woman, lol. Also starring Carlos Mencia as Uncle Tito, Danny McBride as Martin and Scott Wilson as Boo. Stiller may be getting grey, but he manages to convince us of his hilariously hellish situation, ?kerman is a really good choice for the wife from hell, Monaghan is pretty, and Stiller's dad has some stealing moments too. As you would expect in Farrelly Brothers' films there is gross-out stuff and over-the-top characters, this film actually surprised me, I thought it would be average, but it was much funnier romantic comedy than that. Good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Farrelly brothers have shown to do funny and original comedies. They have already proved that they can do really well with Ben Stiller when they made There's Something About Mary, so I was hoping for something good. This movie is not as good, but it still has some funny moments.Ben Stiller plays Eddie Cantrow, a sporting goods store owner. His ex-fiancé is getting married to somebody else. Later, he meets Lila, and they hit it off. They get along so well, that they get married fast. There comes even more trouble when Eddie is on the honeymoon and meets Miranda, played by Michelle Monaghan. Eddie falls for her, but the feeling is not mutual.The raunchiness comes in during the sex scenes between Eddie and Lila, when Lila gets sunburnt on the honeymoon, and that she has nose problems.

It's a typical Farrelly comedy with all these ingredients I did mention but it also does an interesting "analysis" about the young married couples relate nowadays, with plenty of discussion and intolerant behavior.I appreciated that feature but what I did enjoy the most was the typical Farrelly humor of course. There're great funny scenes with all the absurdity that characterizes their movies.I also enjoyed the ending, which I generally don't when watching romantic comedies, but this one is a different one, so it really deserved a nice ending as it has? Ben Stiller is funny as he uses to be and did a regular job.I score it 8/10, especially for the bizarre (but really funny!) humor.</fullReview>

Ben Stiller plays the part he always plays and although he and cast were good at their roles, not even they could pull this off. Undoubtedly, the movie does have it's laugh-out-loud moments but I found it lacked originality and was as predictable as expected, despite the twist at the end. This film is over-filled with unnecessary jokes and sexual references. The sex-scenes were in my opinion, far too graphic and left you with a bad taste in your mouth. I think the first half was better than the second half. Take my advise. If you want to watch a good feel-good comedy staring the lovable Ben Stiller, I would recommend watching 'Along Came Polly', 'Meet the Parents' or 'There's something about Mary' but not this. Overall, this film is OK although it is nothing we haven't seen before. 5/10. You can do better.</fullReview>

It's got a terrible plot which is obviously expected from this sort of film but come on! for those of you reading this that have seen it you'll know what i mean.Now some of the jokes were actually quite brilliant but in comparison with the jokes that feel flat on there face you are talking like a 90 - 10 ratio of bad to good jokes. That is the only reason this film didn't get lower rated is that there were 3 or 4 moments that i laughed myself to tears at.It just isn't good to be honest it's Stillers worst easily and no one else in the film even begins to help pick it up at any point.When there are so many great comedy's out there to be discovered i recommend anyone thinking of watching this saves there time for something brilliant.However i could see this film being funny for the likes of any who found things like, Harold and kumar , Ali g in da house or jay and silent bob or any other crap comedy's funny for that matter.Just about 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those who know Ben Stiller films (MEET THE FOCKERS and NIGHT AT THE MUSEUM) know that they are to be taken lightly. In other words, leave your brain at the door and get down to those base instincts when you watch one of his flicks: hunger, sex ...and more sex. And THE HEARTBREAK KID is no exception.And so the story goes...Eddie (Stiller) is having commitment issues. He seems destined to be THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN, but without the virginity. He just can't find the right gal to marry and looks to be headed toward loneliness in his latter years. This is proved to be correct when he's invited to an ex-girlfriend's wedding and has to sit at the singles' table which is surrounded by 12 year olds. His father Doc (real-life father Jerry Stiller, HAIRSPRAY) doesn't have much sound advice, nor does his best friend Mac (Rob Corddry, FAILURE TO LAUNCH). His father is only interested in the carnal portions of any relationship, while Mac is so whipped by his wife he can't do or go anywhere without her knowing it (his personalized ring-tone for her is hilarious, by the way).But then Eddie meets Lila (Malin Akerman) and his life seems to have found its partner ...until they go on their honeymoon. "Like a switch" being turned, Lila begins to exhibit some very unusual behavior, including rough sex talk (and rough sex itself) and information about her life that startles Eddie ("I thought you worked?") After Lila gets a nasty sunburn, Eddie heads out onto the beaches of Cabo and meets the girl of his dreams. Her name is Miranda (Michelle Monaghan, GONE BABY GONE) and she's on vacation with her father, mother, cousins, and brothers. The two spark immediately and Eddie feels the need to get out of his new marriage and into something of more ...umm ...stability with Miranda.Miscommunications and deceit are the nature with which Eddie finds himself lost in the quagmire of newlywedism and true love.Bit parts move the film along, including a typical nasty role from Carlos Mencia as Tito, a perverted employee at the hotel where Eddie is staying; and Roy Jenkins as Buzz, Miranda's brother and protector who shoves a few things where they don't belong when he learns of Eddie's deception.The film's most troubling aspect, though, is that it jumps around a lot and loses focus. From Carlos Mencia placing his "thing" in Lila's hand, to a very long section about Eddie trying to get back to America and having to go "wet-back" in order to do so, these diversions really hurt the main portions of the film.But the surprise ending really helped the story tremendously. I won't give it away, but I will say that it surprised me greatly; I hadn't seen it coming but it was perfectly in line with what probably would've actually happened.Just remember, though, it's still comedy-lite.P.S. Did anyone else think of Cameron Diaz in the role of Miranda? Maybe it was just me...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller is one of my favorite comedians for the reason that he is well versed in many different types of humor. The guy can do flat out stupid stuff, smart humor, physical and slapstick humor, and of course, awkward humor better than 90% of today's working talent. THBK is no different. He gives a strong performance that overshadows how unlikable his character really is. The latest Farrelly Brothers offering is a straightforward movie that is very predictable, but is sure to deliver some laughs along the way.Like I've said, the performance of Stiller is no surprise, but I enjoyed a few other people in there as well. First, of course, is the beautiful Michelle Monaghan, who plays the lovely Miranda here. Monaghan has a charm about her that's irresistible to me, and after talking with some other people, I think I'm not alone in this. Her star surely is rising after several other high profile projects. She has a bright future ahead of her. Her Miranda makes the movie watchable, and balances out the unlikable Eddie (Stiller). This is the mark of good direction and character development.Unlike most comedies, THBK has great character development. There's a ton of great people in the film that make it that much better. Hilarious lines from Danny McBride and Roy Jenkins really keep the supporting cast balanced, and Carlos Mencia is actually funny in his role. Malin Akerman is psychotic and awkwardly hilarious in her role as Eddie's wife.I appreciated the work done on this film, and I feel it is better than most of the half assed comedies that come out nowadays. It will undoubtedly be remembered as one of Stiller's lesser vehicles, but I still think it is worth a watch. But that doesn't mean it's a diamond in the rough. There are many moments where the humor goes to far and borders on disturbing and disgusting. The Farrelly Brothers also don't hesitate to use the childish potty jokes that most viewers get from every comedy, which kind of takes away from the unique comedy experience that this film had the potential to give.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ever made a simple mistake in your life which turned out to be otherwise? No? I don't mean the opposite of a simple mistake which is a right choice; but what if it turned out to be the extremely worst mistake that you have ever committed? Well, frankly, this movie describes just what it takes when you committed something wrong without the primary intention. Ben Stiller plays Eddie in this comedy-freak romance movie when he, out of peer pressure decided to tie the knot and settle down. After all, as long as it gets, he has been single in all of his life and to meet a charming lady, the next one that is who would actually respond to his signals; he would jump on it rather than to sit on the fence and wait. All this, and thanks to the wonderful advise from Eddie's father, who is also the real life father of Ben Stiller.He did just that when the seemingly fabulous and sexy Lila chanced upon him and he proposed just within a matter of a few weeks. Lila agreed to the proposal and they got along just fine during the wedding. All hell starts to break lose when they start off with their honeymoon vacation. With multiple loads of irritation that begin to hurdle its way to Eddie's life, he soon begins to understand that something is just not right. Despite that being so, it is not easy putting up with the aggressive Lila, both in social outside life and on the bed.Eddie's thoughts were confirmed when during their honeymoon, he met an interesting charming lady, Miranda; to whom he realized to be his actual long life partner, the perfect soul mate. She melt his heart and she is totally nothing like that of Lila. Miranda was in the same vacation hotel as both as Eddie and Lila as it is an annual thing to celebrate her parent's wedding anniversary. All of them (Miranda's family) took a liking for Eddie as he charms them with his ways of thinking and his entertaining jokes. They took to believe that he is just down for a vacation and understood that he is just another single guy wandering alone, and they all knew that the both of them, Eddie and Miranda would seem to be the best and right couple.The inevitable escape from the hotel room by Eddie soon became fairly easy when Lila got herself sun-burnt out of her own fault. That kept Lila in the house while Eddie walked in and out without much of an anticipation or fear. Both the new couple got along rather well and indeed, the typical friendship blossomed into somewhat of a more intimate relationship. But that was without a wonder anyway, until Eddie's secret start to leak out. As he tries going along to cover up one of his past secrets, another would jut out to which in the end of everything; would he be able to do that one sole thing to make his life fulfilled? Would he have the guts to sign a break up with Lila (who would definitely kill him) and patch things up with Miranda (after the discovery that he is a married man, to a lady with an erm? heavy bush)? I ain't spoiling it much for you, but if you like Ben Stiller as a comedy man, together with his dad Jerry Stiller (who is also a famous comedian if you have no idea), then you would just simply enjoy this 18-SX film.</fullReview>

Although the story carried me to the wonderful beaches, it failed to accommodate my appetite for laughing.all in all this movie is decent for Ben stiller fans. I repeat, for Ben stiller fans only. If you are not, it would be an agonizing ordeal... i would suppose.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty nice piece of comedy. I didn't laugh out loud, but it gave me a few chuckles here and there and that's about all I ask from a comedy nowadays. It's not bad, but not good either. It's not a serious film, it's almost like any other comedy that Ben Stiller acted in as lead character. It's perfect for his style and those that like it will enjoy the movie very much. Now, the spoiler section... Ben Stiller... well, he knows the perfect way to show the viewers how his character is living a pathetic little life, a single guy that doesn't even take advantage of his bachelor status. Nice performance. Malin Akerman... she looks and sounds too much like Cameron Diaz, but otherwise she is great as a deranged, crazy woman. Any man would be sorry to end up married with such a person. The plot is almost mindless, but in a funny way. Maybe married people can relate to it even, who knows? Eddie's father shows that he has lots of experience. His married, pussywhipped, hypocrite best friend is giving him advices about life, when he clearly feels like he is trapped. Lila is the text book psycho girlfriend, everything is perfect at first, but after some time her "demons" start to show themselves. Eddie's mistake was that he didn't listen to his instinct and rushed into marrying her before Lila showed her true self. It's hilarious how he starts finding out really important stuff about his spouse only after the wedding. I guess the scenes of them dating (all they did was kiss continuously) was all there was to it. Overall, you can enjoy it. Lots of twists, some funny accidents, outrageously funny sex scenes and good actor performances. Just don't have high expectations walking in the cinema, you might not be satisfied.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is actually a love movie, a genuine romance; I enjoyed it?despite myself, I could add. What did I like mostly? The cast? The script? You know what? I believe Stiller plays better than Sandler. Sandler seems shallower. But Stiller is somehow almost half a Willis; he scores. Before seeing this comedy, I didn't truly know that I'm a Stiller fan. On the other hand, poor Stiller is extremely unlike Willis. Stiller has that doltish soft?_spokenness ?; he's not slick?he's merely well?meaning.A very funny and genuinely cheering sex comedy, Beyle upside?down, featuring a great?shape Ben Stiller as a perpetual in?love youngster?Eddie?the husband of the blonde Malin Akerman (a quite fine piece of ass). The humor is often gross, coarse, disreputable, terminally enjoyable?Lila pissing on Eddie, etc.. Yeah, or Stiller gently fondling a rat and complaining about the fact that the rat bites him. That's genuinely sick humor, absurd and believably silly. Or the Mexican folk dances barrack. None expects that. There's also a fair amount of nudity. Eddie's wife, a pretty chick with Eddie's father ?. Michelle Monaghan plays an interesting babe met by Eddie while, of course, on honeymoon with Lila. Well, these two babes, Akerman and Monaghan, are nicely handled by Stiller; Malin show her tits, during a prodigious sex?scene. Well, each of these two babes, Akerman and Monaghan, got her shot at celebrity.The cast mentions a word; Jerry Stiller plays Eddie's father, and he knows how to be an abominable dad.Eva Longoria does a very nice cameo; she looks hot.</fullReview>

Admittedly, it's something different from the Farrelly Brothers, but it simply doesn't work. Ben Stiller isn't remotely funny as the hapless husband who realizes his new bride (Malin Akerman) has too many faults. A sweet Michelle Monaghan partially redeems the film but her crass relatives torpedo any chance this film has of being a romantic comedy.

		<shortDescription>Save Your Money. See the Elaine May, Neil Simon Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can talented filmmakers like the Farrelly Brothers screw up a gem like the Heartbreak Kid. They destroyed a great story in the hopes of what-I-don't-know. The original is a classic film that was directed by the great Elaine May and written by Neil Simon. The original had great laughs, pathos and some amazingly funny and sometimes shocking scenes with Charles Grodin as Lenny Cantrow who chases after blond goddess Kelly played by Cybill Shepherd. That cast from top to bottom was picture perfect and the film was impeccably written and directed. This remake has no edge or plot and the talented cast seems like they are trying all too hard to work with awful material. With Ben Stiller on board this remake could have been as good or better than the original. Take my advice-- don't waste your time paying this version. Don't get me wrong there are some good laughs in it, but we are talking a remake of a near screen classic that could have been much better with the talented filmmakers and cast on board. See it for free when it comes on cable and then rent the original. You won't regret it.</fullReview>

I have heard people bash this movie and say it was terrible, but it really isn't all of that. This movie may not be in the league of Meet the Parents, but it does have some of the same humor from There's Something About Mary. Like I've said before, don't call this Ben Stiller's greatest work, but at least consider it a sleep favorite. This movie is at least watchable for 2 or 3 times. I hope that Stiller does come out with something better next time, but this might be a small gem leading to a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit better than expected.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No, the Farrelly brothers don't seem to make them like they did back in the 1990s, but this updated version of The Heartbreak Kid isn't really a disaster. There are plenty of funny moments, and the situation itself makes for a good story. There just aren't as many laughs as you'll find if you revisit classics like Dumb and Dumber, Kingpin, and There's Something About Mary.Ben Stiller plays a 40 year old bachelor who thinks he has finally met the girl of his dreams. Early plot complications and advice from his father and best friend cause him to jump the gun and propose to her after only about six weeks. Obviously, six weeks is hardly enough to know if someone is marriage material, and no sooner are the two of them driving down to Mexico for their honeymoon, then we see this woman really get on Stiller's nerves. Lila (Malin Akerman) is quite a beauty, but she has all manner of problems. We find out when Stiller does that she has no money, huge debts, a deviated septum, aggressive sexual appetites, and many other things a life-long bachelor like this critic would certainly find annoying. Once they settle in to their honeymoon, Stiller meets the fetching Michelle Monaghan, and promptly falls for her. Needless to say, complications abound.This film has gotten a large amount of criticism for some truly gross moments. Some involve things like urinating on a jellyfish sting, an obvious prostitute with fake boobs, and a donkey with an enormous erection. Sure, these things are distasteful, but nothing really worse than we see in most other comedies these days. Jerry Stiller has also been criticized for being a dirty old man, but so what? These kinds of people do exist, and many of his lines are in fact funny. There is also some ethnic humor involving Mexicans and illegal immigrants, but nothing in too bad of taste. I think when you boil this film down, it underperformed for the simple fact that it lampoons marriage and commitment. Everybody these days seems like they cannot wait to run down the aisle and have kids. But this kind of life just isn't for everyone, and there is nothing wrong with being a bachelor if that's the kind of life you wish to live. Is Stiller shallow in this film? Oh, yes. But it would be best to remember that this film is a farce and not to take it too seriously.Stiller's performance might have been a bit off. I don't personally think he is too old for the role, but he just comes off as too irritable in some scenes. Most likely he was trying to channel Charles Grodin who played the star of the original. I have never seen that film, but have seen many of Grodin's other films. He is always exasperated, and up-tight. Maybe Stiller watched all of Grodin's films to prepare for this role and just got stuck trying to emulate him rather than taking ownership of the role for himself. Hard to say for sure. Anyway, the film is generally funny, and worth about 6 of 10 stars.The Hound.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average by all standards</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid is a romantic comedy directed by the Farrelly brothers and starring Ben Stiller. It describes a man named Eddie who has trouble building a relationship with women. With some encourage from his father, Eddie decides to date a woman he meets on the street. Soon after, they get married and go on a honeymoon to Mexico. During this time, Eddie realizes that she isn't the wife he envisioned.It is a rather standard recipe, but manages to throw a few interesting twists anyway. The acting is decent but unspectacular. Ben Stiller retains his style from previous films to the point that he feels like the same character. Malin Akerman does a solid job as the wife, although I admit I ended up hating her character. The dialog and writing is somewhat dull but works good enough (for most people).If there is any strong point, its probably the plot; but even this hardly satisfying. I liked the steady buildup towards the climax. It came together nicely at that point, throwing many of the old concepts around. The ending was interesting.The amount you will enjoy The Heartbreak Kid depends largely on your tastes. If you enjoy comedies, then you will probably think its okay. It gave some good laughs, but did not bring in any fresh ideas. Anyone who is looking for more than a simple comedy will be disappointed. The film is completely forgettable; I already had trouble remembering the details by the end of the day. I imagine that it will have left me entirely within a week. An average comedy, but nothing more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ben Stiller (Meet the parents) stars as Eddie, a sporting goods store owner who is single. He meets Lila and soon gets married. On their honeymoon, Eddie starts noticing faults in his wife, and that's not all he notices when Miranda appears?This romantic comedy drama from director Bobby Farrelly (There's something about Mary) shows Stiller in his typical role as a loving romantic loser stereotype by being unable to confront his true feelings, acting silly and somewhat of a geek.Not to criticize Stiller's performance because he does it very well along with the other cast. It's the storyline more than anything that lets the film down with hardly any real humour and the formation of the plot, following pretty much every other romantic cliché around. The film focuses upon physical humour, such as appearances, crashes, clichés and stereotypes. Though there are a few humorous moments there isn't a consistency behind the plot and so the film fails to fulfil what could have been a more engaging and funny comedy.It always seems to be in such a rush with not many scenes lasting a long time, jumping from one idea to the next. At times it was so predictable I had to turn away because I couldn't watch it. However the film does it many good turns. A twist at the end of the film is quite amusing and the jokes which are funny are laugh out loud. The actors and cast do well, the direction is OK and the setting I think is good as it a good motive for the situations and scenarios. Overall it's a pretty average romantic comedy, clichéd like all other romantic films but has its moments.</fullReview>

This film contains the laughs that have become the staples of comedy films of this type these days. Its pretty much Basic (Farrelly) Comedy 101. Randy Father. Crazy Chick. Sweet Chick. Naive Southern Family. Sex Gags. Visual Gags. Whipped Husband. And some body fluids. The only thing noticeably different is the grey in Stiller's hair.But its got enough laughs to break through the sluggishness. Malin Akerman gives an entertaining performance as the sweet chick who Stiller takes the plunge with before turning out to be a little 'off' on their honeymoon. Their mismatched sex is hysterical and so is some later immigration stuff. Nice to see everyone hasn't completely lost it, but now lets have something to show you've still got it.</fullReview>

Instead they get up close and personal with honeymooners Eddie and Lila, laying bare just how much work a sexually demanding blonde can really be. Stay for the closing credits. There's two fun bonus scenes, plus a nice cover version of Linda Ronstadt's "Different Drum" by Susanna Hoffs of the Bangles.

		<shortDescription>The Heartless Jerk is a more appropriate title for this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller needs to stop playing the same roles over and over again (the lovable loser, the jerk, or the loser jerk). The Heartbreak Kid is his latest fiasco.Fortyish man Eddie is pressured to settle down by his horny dad and his (un)happily married buddy. He endured a five-year engagement with another woman whose wedding he attends at the beginning of the film. Pretty blonde Lila, a low-rent Cameron Diaz, is the (un)lucky girl that marries Eddie. She starts off as an innocent sweetheart, but after marriage and during the drive to their Mexican honeymoon, she becomes a sex-crazed, singing-obsessed, sunburn-scarred nut-job (at least in Eddie's eyes, I didn't think she was THAT bad) with just a non-paying volunteer job, a lot of debt, and can't even get Eddie's real name right. So what does Eddie do? He hangs with another vacationer Miranda, who he falls for, and her family which includes a Parchesi-loving cousin that's easily suspicious of Eddie. Eventually, everyone at the resort finds out the truth (after a few misunderstandings and a few stories from the annoying gay-obsessed twins). Eddie follows Miranda to her hometown to win her back after obtaining an annulment, only to be told that she married the guy she dumped before going to Mexico. Despite this, Eddie STILL tries to win her back, getting the bat by Miranda's cousin. Towards the end, Eddie loses his sporting-goods store to Lila and is living and working in Mexico, Miranda returns to Mexico, her marriage ended, he wants to hook up, she accepts, and OH GOD, he's married to ANOTHER girl (the chick from Desperate Housewives).Gee, and we're suppose to feel for Eddie? The protagonist is suppose to have a heart, not be a perpetual jerk. Lila was not THAT bad. Not the sharpest knife in the drawer, but still, to dump her mid-honeymoon for yet another woman you barely know? This was one time I was glad Miranda's cousin hit Eddie with the bat because he deserved it. And what's with Eddie's friend giving bad marital advice when it's obvious that he's miserable in his marriage to Stepford wife (the Wicked Witch of the West ring-tone is priceless)? Just leave her if you're miserable already! And Jerry Stiller has played the horny dad that embarrasses his son too many times. And Carlos Mencia is not funny (and I'm not joking in this case).And what's with this movie's obsession with sticking things up people's noses or things coming out of noses (large pills, hot peppers, etc.)?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She got the store???!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid is a mildly amusing offbeat romantic comedy that's at least a tad outside the usual mold of such fare. As many others have noted it's not anywhere near as funny or engaging as the Farrelly brothers' best work, such as "There's Something About Mary", but it does retain some of that taboo breaking humor.On a side note though I feel I've got to comment on one bit of social reflection that emerges in the last few moments of the film. In the divorce "she got the store"???!!!!! WHAT!!!!??? Why did she get anything for that 1 week marriage, much less his livelihood to that point??Romantic comedies always contain a fair amount of background on the state of play between the sexes. It's generally a female centric one, since after all it's a genre pitched squarely and unambiguously at a female audience. Yeah you want to offer something for the guys, who are generally either in dating or wife/gf pleasing mode, but that's secondary. So OK there's always a slant. Nonetheless I thought it remarkable that after a disastrous honeymoon only length marriage lasting maybe a week before separation, that Stiller would off handedly mention, as though it's a matter of unquestionable course, that in the divorce his ex wife "got the store". The store that he acquired prior to the micro length marriage or even before meeting his momentary wife, that was his only livelihood to that point. Not a bad two weeks work for her! Fair? Something to just accept as the normal course of American life? Even in Cali this would be an unlikely result even now, but my point is that it's treated here as a given in our "romantic" culture at this point. WHAT AN OUTRAGE ? especially since a somewhat less exaggerated version of the same all too often is a given. And then people suppose it's mere age old "fear of commitment" that's causing so many of the more in demand men to delay marriage so long, or increasingly to avoid it completely, in favor of cohabitation etc.(Yeah I know it's a plot device but it's note remotely necessary - he could just as easily have sold it himself.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different kind of romantic comedy chock full of bad morals, infidelity, and sleaziness. I liked it, I don't know why, but I did.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heartbreak Kid is about a sporting goods store owner Eddie (Ben Stiller), who is still single at age 40. Eddie really wants to just settle down and start his life with the right woman. And soon he meets a great, beautiful girl named Lila (Malin Akerman). After just a few short weeks Eddie really believes Lila is the one, and decides to marry her. But while on their honeymoon down in Cabo, Eddie realizes that he's made a huge mistake, and that Lila is the bride from hell. She's immature, obsessive, an S&amp;M lunatic in bed, has a deviated septum from a past coke problem, owes a lot of money to different people, and doesn't technically even have a real paying job. The honeymoon turns into a living hell, especially when Lila gets a huge sunburn, blames it on Eddie, and pretty much locks herself in the hotel room for a few days. But it's here that Eddie goes out and meets a vacationing girl named Miranda (Michelle Monaghan). She's down to Earth, smart, gorgeous, and everything Eddie's ever dreamed of...that Lila's not. Eddie falls in love with her after two days, and suddenly decides SHE is the one. The only problem is he has to break it off with Lila, and keep his reasons for being in Cabo a secret, if he really wants to keep her, and not let her find out he's just a total creep.For anyone who wants to see beautiful romantic film, or just a regular chick flick, The Heartbreak Kid is not for you. This a sleazy, mean spirited, raunch-tacular movie that's not for the faint of heart. The jokes mostly center around the mean spirits, and Ben Stiller's pathetic jerk of a character. This is definitely hit or miss with some audiences, either you'll like it or you'll probably hate it. Personally I enjoyed it, but only because I like raunchy comedies. I've sat through plenty of chick flicks before, bored out of my mind usually. I liked this movie because it flips those movies by their ears. As always Ben Stiller is still one of the best guys around to play miserable, pathetic characters. This movie gives Stiller something new to do though. Since not only is his character Eddie a flat out jerk, he also becomes very creepy and obsessive over the course of the film. Chick flicks are normally very clichéd, with the male love interest usually being a nice guy. I really got a kick out of watching this movie break the common clichés, and focus instead on a self absorbed weirdo.Most of the performances are amiable here. Malin Akerman has fun as the demented bride from hell. Her character is the biggest source of raunch in this movie, since her character does lots of gross things, and has gross things happen to her. Lila is not technically a horrible person, but she is pretty unpleasant. Although I don't completely understand Eddie's relationship with her. He dates her for six weeks and then marries her, you'd think he would have realized she drives him nuts before going on their honeymoon. But then you wouldn't have a movie. And the first scene where Eddie realizes how crazy Lila is, where she sings horribly for hours to the worst songs on the radio, is very funny. Ben Stiller's reactions are hilarious. Michelle Monaghan's character Miranda is very much like a character plucked out of a regular chick flick. She's beautiful, funny, and a generally pleasant character. But instead of being put in a chick flick where she belongs, she's in a movie where she's set up with a guy who's out to fool her. The results are pretty funny, and Miranda turns out to be this film's only set of consciences. On the side we have Jerry Stiller as Eddie's dad (small world); Rob Corddry as Eddie's best friend who supplies him terrible tips on marriage; Carlos Mencia as Tito, a Mexican hotel manager and bartender, who thinks everything's a joke; and Danny Mcbride as Miranda's over-protective cousin, who has little trust of Eddie. The side characters provide a few good laughs. Especially Danny Mcbride who has real comedic talent, and made me laugh every time his strangely over-protective character walked on screen. And Carlos Mencia actually does a pretty good job here. His show on Comedy Central is very outrageous, and sometimes it's a little too much. But his role never gets too over the top here, which was a relief.While The Heartbreak Kid tries to break traditional chick flick clichés, that doesn't change that it's riddled with a few clichés itself. Some of the humor is a little generic of other Hollywood comedies, and some of the raunchy gags have been done before more or less. Although I've never seen characters get a giant pill stuck in their deviated septums, or get urinated on to heal a jellyfish sting. It's not exactly a great return to form for raunchy comedy for the directors The Farelly Brothers either. While a lot of the humor in the Farellys' There's Something About Mary worked, this movie is way sleazier and creepier than that movie will ever be. And that will definitely turn away plenty of audiences. Some of it was a little too much for me, and the movie's characters got kind of annoying at times. But I'd recommend it to anyone who likes a raunchy, yet kind of clichéd, comedy flick. But be warned it's not for anyone looking for a good ol' chick flick (said it about 20 times by now), people who hate raunchy comedy, ...or people with deviated septums. I give The Heartbreak Kid a 3.5 out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated movie, ...and it's more than just an ordinary comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all I have to mention that I had a rough look at the IMDb entry before watching this movie. I told my girl friend, let's take another one, this one isn't worth watching. But this time she had the right to decide, so we went for it.I can understand that some people have expected something different when watching "The Heartbreak Kid"; yes, it's a comedy, but it's more! And no, this movie does not only show the well-know, superficial kind of gags like in some many other Hollywood movies; there is more than that, there are a couple sequences that appear to be even rude, but, ...to be honest, it's so funny and I enjoyed it so much.As far as you very conservative, strictly religious etc., just avoid to watch it, but otherwise it's great opportunity to get beyond the usual crap we have to suffer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Heartbreak Kid (2007) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in the mood for dinner followed by a rare evening out at the movies, so the wife and I chose this comedy which we'd wanted to see for awhile (and nope, I had no idea it was a remake of a 1972 film until after the fact). I have come to enjoy Ben Stiller, and here he plays a 40 year old average single guy named Eddie who is getting pressure from everyone around him (including his dad, Jerry Stiller) to finally get hitched. When he has a chance meeting with a lovely 20-something girl named Lila (Malin Akerman) he quickly marries her after knowing her for only a short time. Once the newlyweds begin their honeymoon in Cabo, Eddie begins to see that Lila is a complete nutjob with a lot of personal longstanding issues to boot! Now desperate to get out of this premature marriage, Eddie is soon able to hang around the islands alone when Lila gets stuck up in their hotel room all day with a horrific case of chronic sunburn. He meets and falls for young Miranda (Michelle Monaghan) who is also vacationing in Cabo along with her relatives.Like many movies of its type these days, this one runs far too long and begins to get tiresome, but along the way there are some funny laughs and the real standout is Malin Akerman, who does a fine job of doing a severely zany turnabout in personality once she gets the ring on her finger. Ben Stiller is about par for the course, and I personally would have preferred that his father Jerry had more screen time and offbeat lines. **1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie didn't just have a completely outrageous story, but it also made me really mad to watch. Ben Stillers character is a complete lowlife who goes and marries some women he barely knew and then dumps her on their honeymoon for another women. There is absolutely nothing funny about it at all, except for maybe the fact that his character would be stupid enough and desperate enough to do this things he did in the film. After discovering that Stillers character was to much of an idiot to tell her that he was already married, she marries someone else. Oh, but wait, about a year later they meet up again and fall in love although Stillers character has but another wife. How cliché huh? This movie although funny from time to time is complete trash that you'd be better off skipping it all together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very disappointed watching this film. It was more annoying than funny. I didn't even laugh once...not once. The only funny part in the whole movie was a scene I had already seen in the commercial a billion times. I was more annoyed than the husband played by Ben Stiller and couldn't wait for this movie to end. It's funny how these commercials on T.V. can make a movie look so good and then you go see it in the theater and wanna walk out and get your money back. It wasn't even a comedy. I was expecting this to be good after seeing "Meet The Fockers" and "Something About Mary," but it was nowhere close to even a quarter as funny as those and I think they knew that and thought "hey, we'll just put this trash out there and people will wanna see it." It just plain sucked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Girlfriend loathes Ben Stiller. She loathes him almost as much, but not quite as much, as she loathes Jim Carrey. When I pointed out to her that Ben Stiller has been in some really good films, she said that that might well be the case, but those films were good despite of Ben Stiller and not because of Ben Stiller.How curious. I tend to think pretty much the opposite. I think a number of really average films have been improved by Ben Stiller being in the cast. And that just about brings us to "The Heartbreak Kid" .Frankly, it is hardly a great film, but if you are a Farrelly Brothers fan, and I am, you will find enough to enjoy because it is exactly like all of their other films. I cannot make any comparison between this film and the original "The Heartbreak Kid", because I have never seen the original, but the Farrelly's version is stupid, rude, vulgar and gross out. As I said, just like all of their other films. Hey! No harm in watching one of those, once in a while.I thought that Ben Stiller was good. Nobody plays Mr. Exasperated like Ben Stiller. I thought that Malin Akerman was good. Gorgeous and sexy and as mad as a fish. I thought that Michelle Monaghan was OK, but it was a thankless part as all she really had to be was pretty and nice and normal and the kind of girl you would introduce to your Mother. Jerry Stiller (Ben's Dad) was really funny."The Heartbreak Kid" is not subtle, but if you are in the right frame of mind, it is enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw The Heartbreak Kid, I love the Farrelly Bros., I think that 'Stuck On You' is one of the most under rated comedy films of all time, 'There's Something About Mary' and 'Dumb and Dumber' are classics, this is not a classic, but it is not terrible either. We have Ben Stiller playing Ben Stiller (I know a lot of people hate that but I love it), a nervous commitmentphobe who marries the wrong woman (played by the beautiful and hilarious Malin Akerman), while on his honeymoon Stiller meets the girl of his dreams (played by the always fantastic Michelle Monaghan), hilarity and mishaps ensue, and it is funny, well that part is anyway. The first 2 acts are great and funny, I really got a feel of a Farrelly brothers comedy which was great but in the third act it takes an idiotic turn into a stupid movie (funnily enough just as soon Malin Akerman left the film). Just stupid jokes and idiotic plot twists and one of the worst endings I have ever seen (which really should have been fixed in test screenings). All in all I was gonna give it a 9/10 but then the 3rd act came along and it got pushed down to a 7/10. It's a good movie, not comedy gold but still fun. Not the Farrelly's best but not their worst (that belongs to Shallow Hal).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a brave man with a ego bigger than Texas who thinks he can write better than Neil Simon and neither of the Farrelly brothers is fit to change Simon's typewriter ribbon. Back in 1972 Simon adapted Bruce Jay Friedman for Elaine May to direct and the result was a ball but a quarter of a century later this woeful remake is embarrassingly non-funny, non-dark, non-much-of-anything except crude which has, of course, always been the Farrelly's strong suit. May's daughter, Jeannie Berlin was magnificent in the original as the wife married in too much haste by Charles Grodin and other than May herself - who played a similar part to perfection in A New Leaf - it's difficult to think who could equal let alone eclipse Berlin. On the other hand the Multiplex woods are going to be full of popcorn punters who never even heard of the original let alone saw it and they will no doubt enjoy this pale to the point of ashen imitation.</fullReview>

It's a great movie !!! The only reason that this movie has a bad rating it's because some people were shocked by the morality. Ben Stiller is just in an impossible situation where he realizes he made a terrible mistake. I'm not trying to influence anybody, I just wanted to say "Watch the movie before reading the bad comments on it". It's like seeing a anti-bush film, many people will try to discredit it because they don't agree with the writers views and will simply put a bad rating without seeing the movie. Maybe in the United States it didn't make a lot of money but it did abroad just like Alexander which is a great movie. I guess many people doesn't associate Leader and Gay.

		<fullReview>This film is about a man on a honeymoon with the wife of his dreams, only to meet another woman of his dreams.It is unfortunate that this film doesn't hit the right tone. The jokes are not funny, and the film turns out to be boring and annoying. Uncle Tito and the Mexican band are plain annoying. Martin's impulse control problem is way over the top, and he is annoying and unlikeable at the same time. Leila, on the other hand, is charming initially but becomes scary very soon afterwards. Ben Stiller's character, Eddie, is way too familiar. Hasn't he played this character before over and over again? The only likable character is Miranda, and this is not enough to make a film work. The only thing I enjoy about the film is the scenery of the Mexican resort. Even then, in the scene where Eddie talks to Leila in the beach side restaurant, the colours are so saturated that it almost look like bad CGI. Oh, and that scene featuring a horse with a huge erection trying to copulate with a young woman is simply way too outrageous. "The Heartbreak Kid" is an instantly forgettable film that can hardly justify spending money or time on.</fullReview>

All his life, Eddie Cantrow (Stiller) has been searching for his one true love. While his quest to end his bachelor days continues, his friends are all busy tying the knot.Eddie Cantrow doesn't want to be the last bachelor on the block so he takes some unsound advice and marries the first beautiful girl he happens to run into. Lila (Akerman) is not only a strikingly gorgeous gal with healthy physical needs; she is also a bat out of hell.Cantrow discovers that there's more to life than marrying for the sake of it. Enter Miranda (Monaghan) a cute down-to-earth gal on the rebound. In true Farrelly brother style, the humour is crass and outrageous. The graphic sex scenes are a diversion from Stiller's mainstream work, but it gels in this particular little entrée.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Farrellys Flail on a Flummoxing Flick About a Schlub Who Turns Into a Jerk</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a smattering of laughs in this 2007 comedy, the latest over-the-top concoction from the Farrelly Brothers, but the laugh quotient is not nearly enough to sustain interest in this particularly mean-spirited movie. Ostensibly a remake of the 1972 Elaine May-directed comedy penned by Neil Simon, this film trivializes the original's overriding theme of the have-nots coveting the privileged lives of the haves by focusing more strictly on the premise of a lifelong bachelor who decides to marry only to find out it's a grave mistake and moves from one deception to the next to get out of it once he thinks he has found his soul mate. It should not come as a big surprise that Farrellys focus most of their attention on the humiliation and gross-out antics, but their techniques seem more contrived and their set-ups more scripted this time around, especially when Judd Apatow has done a better job humanizing such hi-jinks in movies like Knocked Up and The 40-Year-Old Virgin. Moreover, the film shows a particularly cruel streak toward the two women involved in the shenanigans. The bloom may finally be off the hair goo.The plot starts out promisingly in a particularly picturesque San Francisco (thanks to Matthew Leonetti's crisp cinematography) as Eddie Cantrow, the lonely owner of a San Francisco sporting-goods store, has a history of averting commitment in his long-term relationships. Turning forty and watching his last girlfriend of five years get married from the desperate kiddie table, he decides to throw caution to the wind when he meets Lila, a seemingly sweet blonde beauty, in a meet-cute situation involving a mugger. They get married after only six weeks of dating, but the marriage starts to unravel on the car trip down to their honeymoon destination, Los Cabos. One bad revelation after revelation comes out, and she evolves into a nightmarish freak with a free-flowing deviated septum. In a twist of fate, she suffers from severe sunburn and is stuck in the hotel room recovering. Enter Miranda, a good-humored girl-next-door from Mississippi in Los Cabos with her extended family. Naturally, Eddie and Miranda hit it off, and you can guess the rest.Ben Stiller plays Eddie in familiar manic mode, though his character degenerates through the course of the story from likable schlub to obsessive jerk. Some of the turns he takes are hilarious, like the out-of-kilter segment where he illegally crosses the border back from Mexico, but for the most part, he just feels like a sketch of a person. Malin Akerman deserves a medal for subjecting herself to a series of humiliations that turn her into an imbecilic harridan, while Michelle Monaghan provides a unique version of the "dream girl" as Miranda. It was a creative move to have a blonde bombshell like Akerman play the one Eddie tries to jettison, but the problem is that both she and Monaghan come across more as victims of their characters' stupidity more than Eddie's machinations. By the end of this overlong movie, I became indifferent to anyone's fate as the story spits and sputters in the final stretch. As the final credits roll, there are two random scenes included that extend on the characters, but they aren't worth the wait.</fullReview>

The film tries to be light hearted but ends up being quite depressing and not believable. Only a socially dysfunctional audience will see this film as romantic. The audience that has learned to create positive relationships may walk out half way through.With a personality like that, Stiller's character would end up alone. Guaranteed.</fullReview>

The story is different that other movies in the same genre. The plot was great, nice actors, some serious moments, but they were also compensated by jokes. It had some killer jokes in it.

		<fullReview>The Farrelly Brother's The Heartbreak Kid is gross, dirty, foul mouthed, but incredibly funny. Ben Stiller's character is an a-hole. You can't really sympathize with his character. But i still think he is funny in it. The Plot: A middle-aged single man meets a sexy woman one day. She is going to be taken to Holland unless she is married, so he decides to marry her. The two go down to Cobo for the week and he realizes who she really is. Lila is a crazy, ex drug addict who beats him up during sex. While vacationing in Cobo, Eddie meets Miranda, a country girl with a family of hicks, including her suspicious cousin Martin. Eddie and Miranda soon fall for each other, and things also start to fall apart. The Heartbreak Kid remake is hilarious. I think everything in the film is funny. I haven't seen one Ben Stiller comedy that i've disliked yet. From Zoolander to Along Came Polly, I still haven't found one yet. The Farrelly Brother's best film is still There's Something about Mary. There's something about Mary is one of the funniest films i've ever seen. The funniest film i've ever seen is The Hangover. I think the worst Farrelly Brothers film is Shallow Hal, and I liked that film also. The Heartbreak Kid has two sex scenes, there's a lot of boobs, there's a vagina stung by a jellyfish, it's crude, and it's hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good comedy-drama ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching the first part of this movie, I couldn't resist seeing it to the end. The first 40 minutes has some great gags and is amusing to watch, but afterwards it changes to more of a situational-type humor and drama (there are not as many good gags). Even so, I wanted to see how the story would turn out.The movie is basically about a fellow who falls for an attractive girl. He rushes to marry her 6 weeks later when he learns that if he doesn't, she will move away due to her job. On their honeymoon, he learns that she is a very different person than what he thought ... and at the same time he meets a lady who seems perfect for him. The story progresses from there.Ben Stiller's performance is great. His mannerisms and expressive dialog make him really interesting to watch. The strength of his performance basically carries the movie.Because the movie is done by the Farrelly brother's, not much is off limits - you can expect to see gross stuff, graphic sex bits, and uncomfortable character and plot developments. That's part of their style.The overall quality of the movie is pretty good because of Stiller. I'd recommend watching it if you're looking for a light comedy-drama. It's a reasonably engaging movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I think of Ben Stiller, instantly I think of Meet the parents, and Meet the Fokers. So when I saw he was coming out with what appeared to be a romantic comedy, it was definitely added to the top of my Netflix cue (ha ha). The movie starts out fairly plain and boring, average guy that cant find a woman, then out of no where he meets the woman of his dreams.. come to find out she is a complete physco. I really felt for his character when they were in the Mini Coop while she is singing every single song on the radio. The vacation seamed a bit off when Carlos Mencia (mind of mencia) is one of the main characters. The movie was hilarious. Especially the awkward nude sex scenes where all the wife is doing is yelling out obnoxious things at Stiller while naming off random sex positions.. I found myself laughing the most during the sex scenes, simply because they were so far out and crazy.. Pretty much if you could imagine your honeymoon in an amazing beautiful place + everything imaginable going wrong + finding a better, nicer and richer woman.. is pretty much this movie.Surprisingly hilarious. With a twist at the end. Didn't care for the ending, I was hoping it was going to end by him getting the girl...rent it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was skeptical about seeing this movie at first. There were so many horrible reviews on here about it. But I can honestly say that I am glad that I finally rented "The Heartbreak Kid". I find this film to be funny and entertaining. Definitely not a deep movie, or anything that you are going to take some life lesson from. But it is a good, mindless escape. Something that at the end of a bad day of work, you can relax and have a few laughs. This is not Stillers best movie, and definitely not the best comedy. But it is not horrible.It starts off with Eddie (Stiller) who is afraid of serious commitment. He has gone through half his life never getting too serious with a woman because he starts picking out all of their flaws. Then finally after watching his ex-girlfriend (of 5 years) get married to another man,...... and constant presure from his dad and best friend....... he decides to get serious. He meets a beautiful blonde who seems perfect. And after 6 weeks of dating he finds out that she has to move away for her "job". He decides to marry her so that she wont have to move. As soon as the wedding is over, on the way to their honeymoon destination, things start to change. His wife who has not had sex with him yet (because she didn't want to ruin the relationship), ends up being a sexual freak. As the film goes on, more and more of her flaws show. Things come out about her, that Stiller never knew......... (she doesn't really have a job; did drugs; etc). And you feel sorry for Stiller cause his new wife is crazy!!!The film goes on, and on the honeymoon, Stiller meets another woman who he really connects with. Then the movie focuses on Stiller trying to get close to this new Woman and get away from his wife.The negatives of the movie are.......... as the film goes on Stiller goes from being a good guy who got himself in a bad situation,.... to a deceptive jerk. Also, the first half of the movie was funnier than the last half. And the ending wasn't that good. Kind of took it over the top at the end.One of the funniest parts, is when Stiller has to make it back into the US from Mexico.</fullReview>

Like the cast, its was very good, Ben Stiller although his character is turning to be kinda repetitive, he still manages to deliver a funny performance, Michelle Monaghan also give a decent acting as Miranda, Malin Akerman was funny but a little overacted sometimes, Jerry Stiller great as always, watching him act along his son Ben Stiller was one of the few worthy things and Carlos Mencia is hilarious as Uncle Tito. To conclude, this definitely was the least funny movie the Farrelly brother have made, I feel kinda disappointed because I expected a lot more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although not perfect, this raunchy comic re-visiting of the 1972 Elaine May film goes a long way towards restoring the edgy reputation that writers/directors Peter and Bobby Farrelly cultivated with their earlier work, particularly "There's Something About Mary" and "Kingpin" (before Judd Apatow stepped in and claimed the mantle with "The 40 Year Old Virgin" and "Knocked Up"). It's definitely not for all tastes and some may find it a tad too cynical and bitter, especially in its twist ending (which I won't reveal here, but will definitely divide viewers...for the record, I loved it). But the film delivers some honest-to-goodness belly laughs along the way, along with a few scenes guaranteed to gross-out and/or shock any thin-skinned audience member who may wander in unaware of the directors' reputation.One observation...I find it curious that it seems a lot of critics are NOW referring to the 1972 film as something of a "comedy classic" in the wake of this remake. I can't recall very many of them mentioning that film when the subject (or even the occasional critics poll, unofficial or not) of "classic comedies" pops up. To be fair, I haven't seen the 1972 film, but I do understand that they differ substantially aside from the basic premise. That said, I believe they both should be judged separately and on each others' merits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extremely funny Ben Stiller movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Stiller stars in The Heartbreak Kid the new Farrelly Brothers movie who for the 3 who do not know are the makers of Dumb and Dumber and There's Something About Mary. The movie is about Edward a guy who has never made the plunge but when he meets Lila he thinks his problems are over but after the marriage is over Lila becomes a psycho path. While trying to live with Lila Edward meets Miranda a girl who he ends up falling in love with ending in a massive web of comedy. The movie is funny for the most of the time and the rest of the time is setting up the very basic but very funny story of this movie. Ben Stiller and the girl who plays Lila do well in this movie and I think the Farrely Brothers have done it again even though this is not even close to being as good as There's Something About Mary is good for 100 minutes of laughter. Overall this movie is a must watch for fans of Ben Stiller and the Farrelly Brothers movies and just a funny movie really. I rate this 62%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Still looking for the milk shooting out of your nose kind of funny you can only get with the 3- Stooges. This movie isn't it, but it's not bad.Lots of laughs although I have to admit I laughed a lot more at shocking scenes than at true humor during the movie, but it was funny.Sometimes you have to quit being so mature and just be comfortable with laughing at something silly -- like this movie. No deeper meaning to be found. No story beneath the story, just fun and worth the couple of hours you invest for relaxation.Ben Stiller isn't going to win an Oscar, but he does bring a lot to the silliness quotient of the movie. Just a normal guy in a very abnormal situation. Along the same lines as Wild Hogs earlier this year. A lot of nonsense that makes you laugh.</fullReview>

I don't think it's possible for a guy to go on his honeymoon, fall in love with another woman and have it all end happily.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was really funny for the first 15 minutes, but after that it just made you frustrated. It made you hate Ben Stiller's character because he was a liar, and really gross. But that was not the reason why i rated the move a 5 out of 10 stars, the movie would have had such a higher rating if the ending wasn't so horrible! But I might just be a tough critic. Bottom line, the movie was enjoyable, but Oh So Frustrating at the same time!Also, this was not the most decent movie for children, there were some pretty graphic sex scenes, and a lot of profanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I walked into the theater I knew only this was a Ben Stiller movie. I saw this movie in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico which added to sneaking across the border scenes. The whole Mexican audience nearly died laughing for that part. Now that I know this is a Farelly brothers movie I would characterize as one of their weaker ones. Like all Farelly productions you have to be able to enjoy that over-the-top style of humor, for example Lila being a super-freak in the bedroom. I was pleasantly surprised by the way movie unfolded and especially enjoyed Jerry Stiller's role as the extremely foul mouthed father. And I never saw the end coming, nor will you.

		<fullReview>the heartbreak kid has to be one of the worst ben stiller movies i have seen in a long time. why he agreed to do this film is beyond me. the writing was bad, there was virtually no plot, at times there was no connection between what was happening in a scene with anything else going on in the movie, and the humor was beyond "crude", it was disgusting. in addition, even though i checked the movie rating beforehand and the explanation for the movie receiving an "r" rating, the content of the movie did not match the explanation given for the rating. the rating explanation said it had crude humor, nudity, strong sexual content, and a scene in which a minor was using drugs. the explanation for the rating did not include explicit sex, vulgar language, excessive nudity, and female genitalia. the film went beyond acceptable standards of decency and should have been given a harsher rating than "r", at least then people would know what they might be in for when walking in the door. don't waste your money on this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With remaking The Heartbreak Kid, The Farrelly Brothers show us they are indeed the kings of rude and crude. This current release bears only a slight resemblance to the 1972 original with Charles Grodin and Cybil Sheppard.Ben Stiller is Eddie, a middle aged bachelor still unmarried and without any foreseeable prospects. He is the butt of constant harassment from friends and family alike, especially his father Doc (played by his real life father, Jerry Stiller).Eddie is always the fifth wheel at social functions where he is under unending encouragement to hit on any available woman. He typically passes up opportunities which only adds to his frustration.One fateful day he rescues Lila (portrayed by the incredibly beautiful Malin Akerman) while she is being mugged. Being Eddie, he fails to exploit the encounter, but she doesn't. She later bumps into him at his sporting goods store and romance blossoms with a little persuasion from Doc.Seeing this as probably his only chance in this lifetime to connect, Eddie marries Lila after knowing her only six weeks. They head out on a Mexican honeymoon and at this point is where the fun begins.While enroute to Cabo San Lucas, Lila demonstrates her unique ability to sing along with every song played on the radio, much to Eddie's chagrin. It is now dawning on him that Lila may not be the one after all. As the story progresses she becomes more coarse and unbearable. Their night time liaisons are less romance and more apt to be wanton sexual flings during which Lila screams at Eddie to "cock" her and "jackhammer" her. Fortunately for Eddie, a severe sunburn leaves Lila confined to their room and he has a chance encounter with Miranda (Michelle Monaghan). She is not the alluring beauty Lila is, but has a much sweeter disposition and there is instant chemistry between her and Eddie, who now takes every chance to meet with her while scheming and lying his way out of spending time with Lila. You can see where the plot is leading, but there is a surprise twist in which Eddie does NOT get Miranda in the end. My favorite character was the wisecracking desk clerk Uncle Tito (Carlos Mencia) who was always saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. There was also a roving mariachi band who appeared to know only one tune and were popping up at the most inappropriate moments.All in all, The Heartbreak Kid was sidesplitting adult entertainment filled with great one liners and in your face antics. Stereotypes abound and it is definitely not for children.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Come on, people, the film is funny. Too many reviewers are focusing on the bit that Ben Stiller's character is, well, a louse. I have news --there are a lot of louses out there, just as there are a lot of hot looking young women with a history of cocaine abuse. The script isn't afraid to get laughs from these issues, and it does. I laughed hard at the insistence of the Mariachi Band invariably showing up at the most inopportune times, and I loved the sunburn bit cuz I have actually have experiences with young women who would not put on sunscreen for the same reason as the Lila character.And, I suggest that the ending is not only funny, but is absolutely consistent with Ben Stiller's character....If anything, this film should be less offensive than the original 1972 version, which is hilarious but does focus on the Jewish man's infatuation with the "dream WASP blonde". Here, both beautiful women seem WASP-y, so no such issue.So, stop making value judgments and you will probably laugh...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe people didn't find this movie funny. There's a fair share of toilet/gross-out humor (which I don't find amusing), but also a really talented cast and lots of clever, original jokes.I felt compelled to add this review to counter the one star reviews made by people who can't take a joke. Sorry it ain't the romantic comedy drivel you were seeking. It's seriously funny...I was laughing uncontrollably at several points. Go watch it and see for yourself.I'm a big Ben/Jerry Stiller fan and they are spot on as always. The leading ladies are pretty entertaining and easy on the eyes (throughout most of the movie anyway).

		<shortDescription>Passable comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this typically unsubtle Farrelly Brothers comedy, Ben Stiller plays bonafide bachelor Eddie, unscrupled to the art of wedding bells and flying bouquets, despite his family and friends all bemoaning his dormant state of being single. Through a complicated set-piece of purse snatching, he happens across a seemingly charming young lady, to whom he eventually becomes besotted. Unfortunately for him, after the wedding bell tolls, he begins to regret his decision, as she turns out to be a complete freak on their honeymoon, eschewing any sense of her former charm. Whilst faux-canoodling on his Mexican excursion, Eddie becomes acquainted with another seemingly charming young woman, and develops conflicting desires. Although it is not quite as rancid in nature as their benchmark work, The Heartbreak Kid lacks the kind of wit and invention that made belly-laugh behemoths Dumb &amp; Dumber and There's Something About Mary so enjoyable. Ben Stiller is perfectly fine at what he does, but it isn't enough to carry this film through the mindless schlock that drag it down a notch or two. Among the mishurdles is a sex scene far more reminiscent of a David Cronenburg horror than a Farrelly's film. And Ben Stiller's father Jerry, playing the archetypal potty-mouthed dad is sorely misused. It may charm die hard toilet-humorists but will fall flat to most audiences familiar with this kind of comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This outrageously hilarious film is about Eddie Cantrow, played by Ben Stiller, who finally meets the girl of his dreams Lila, played by Malin Ackerman, and manages to form a relationship and get married to her in a very short time. Even though Eddie is very happy his doubts about her begin to mount.They go to a Mexican resort for their Honeymoon and Lila suffers very bad sunburn and confined to her room. Eddie meets Miranda, played by Michelle Monaghan, and quickly realizes this is really the girl he wants.From this point it is a succession of really funny events after which Eddie ends up living like a destitute Mexican trying to enter the USA to get back home. There are sexual scenes that graphically push the envelope a little further.The movie concludes with a series of funny twists. If you don't get a good belly laugh off this movie you must be anal retentive or just hate Americans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is your typical Farrelly brothers movie: Raunchy, crude, derogatory, foul mouthed, yet hilariously well done movies. As you watch you realize how dumb and obvious some of the jokes are and yes you also realize that there is probably a better movie out at the moment but this was worth my time to see. Ben Stiller struggles as an actor but is uplifted by the presence of his father, Jerry Stiller who plays Ben's dad on screen for the first time. The plot circles around the conflict of Ben Stiller's character with first his reluctance to get married and then his overeagerness to tie the knot culminating in a very eventful honeymoon with his new wife. He meets a girl played by Michelle Monaghan of MI3 fame and they start falling for one another till the roof caves in as it always does in these romantic comedies. As a whole it is a bit to obvious and cliché at many points but it the film has a soul and many laughs and us well worth a sampling.</fullReview>

Then while on his honeymoon he meets another woman and spends time with her instead of the woman he married! And she doesn't even know that he's married! Of course his wife finds out about this other woman! But when the other woman finds out that he's married she refuses to have anything to do with him! Mean while his wife leaves him. He loses his passport. Then he ends up going back to live where his honeymoon is at and the movie ends with him meeting the other woman. I was alright with it until the scene right after where it turns out he's already married again. And the other woman doesn't know it. There was also a very disturbing scene where it shows a really old women naked and shows her boobs which are literally the size of watermelons! Then there's the scene where it shows his wife's vagina! If you believe in God and care about your soul do not see this movie! I literally felt like I'd sinned against God by watching it!

		<fullReview>If you are looking for about 90 minutes of entertainment, and laughter (and I mean really laugh) and to forget about the real world, go watch this movie. Ben Stiller is as funny as ever and he is the one who really makes this movie a great comedy. In my view whoever says this is a bad movie either is a stiff republican with absolutely no sense of humor or simply just a boring no fun grumpy old man. If you are a married man in all likelihood you would relate to Ben Stiller's character and if you are not married and about to get married then you better learn from Stiller's character! :) And if you are divorced then you definitely feel being the Stiller's character and the reasons behind as why you are divorced! :) In short this is a GREAT very very funny movie just like other Ben Stiller's movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been reading some reviews, and they really haven't been good ones. I do not have a clue why that is. It was sooooo laugh out loud hysterically funny. Okay, there were some cliché parts, but I wouldn't say they "ruined" the movie one bit. And so many people are saying that there weren't that many funny parts. Uh, excuse me, but I was not the only person in the theatres, and I do believe I remember other people laughing 90% of the length of the movie. I don't know what theatre those other people went to that they had to wait 45 minutes to hear people laugh at a funny part, but just stay away from that theatre.Some of the parts seriously almost made me pee myself. My favorite part is when Ben Stiller is talking to Miranda (the girl he falls for on his honeymoon) late at night on the beach. They are talking about random stuff, like space and aliens, and how there might be cows that are really smart on another planet or something like that. And then Miranda says something about UFOs, and then Stiller goes, "Or FOs, because they know what they are." (the U stands for unidentified). But me and my friend thought that was the funniest thing ever, and we were like the only ones who got that part, or thought it was funny. But whatever, there were other funny parts, one consisting of content I am not going to put in here. And there was one other part that I was laughing at for like five minutes, but I can't remember which part it was, but I know it was funny. Overall, this is the first movie in a while that was really that funny. It was Awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good test of whether you would like this movie is whether you liked There's Something About Mary. If you liked it, you'll certainly like The Heartbreak Kid. If you liked 'Mary' but it was a bit too gross or stupid, but made you laugh nonetheless, you'll like The Heartbreak Kid even more than 'Mary'. It's sweet and it's funny -- same thing I would say of 'Mary' and 'Shallow Hal'. The Farrelly brothers can provide rather adolescent humor, but they're not mean-spirited. Even if the characters themselves aren't sweet, there's still something kind about the Farrellys' take on their severely flawed, caricatured characters.I tend to like really obscure, serious films (e.g., Satantango, Ararat), so I hesitated before giving this movie 10 stars. But for what it is, I think it's pretty much perfect. I was continually surprised, and often in ways that made me laugh really hard. It was neither trite nor predictable. The casting was spot-on. The acting may not have been the most challenging, but it was flawless. The pacing was great -- there was never a moment where the energy flagged or I wished it would end soon. And while I say it was sweet, it certainly wasn't sentimental.Ben Stiller is a great comedic actor. He can be a total weasel of a character, but he exhibits a vulnerability that makes him likable nonetheless. He can laugh at himself (witness Zoolander or Dodgeball), which makes laughing at his comedy all the more easy. Jerry Stiller always seems to play practically the same character, but I haven't tired of him. And the female leads, especially Malin Akerman (who is new to me), were perfect foils for Ben Stiller. I left the theater happy and smiling and having had many good laughs. That's a pretty good aftertaste for a comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Many people don't get this film... it's a bittersweet and tragic comedy... not another mindless laugh a minute laugh-fest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to disagree with a number of the reviewers of this movie.I think the biggest problem people make when going to see this movie (and a lot of recent Farrelly movies) is that people assume they are laugh-a-minute "comedies" and it must keep them laughing continuously throughout the movie.The actuality is that this movie is more of a dramatic commentary on misleading people and how love can be misleading when making assumptions about people.Although I wouldn't say this movie is overly "deep", it does have a lot of things in it that can be relatable for anyone that has fallen in love with someone realizing after they have been with them for a while that they are not necessarily who you fantasized about, or had an infatuation with.In this case, the lead character (Ben Stiller) does not portray himself as a likable character. This conundrum has probably caused a number of people to identify this as a flaw in the movie, because they want to like him and relate to him.Had the directors actually made him a likable character, how on earth could they reconcile that with the fact that he cheats on his new wife just nights after their wedding weekend??? How can anyone marry someone and decide within a couple of days that they are not in love with them? I would like to think that anyone with any sense of love would give a marriage more time and work things through with their mate.That being said, this movie does have a number of funny parts, and the person I went with and I both enjoyed it immensely! The difference between us and other reviewers is that we didn't go in with an expectation that it would be "hilarious" and be a better comedy than "Things I Love About Mary". By trying to get this movie to live up to a movie that is mostly a comedy is giving this movie a disservice.Maybe the marketing campaign for this movie was misleading (which is overly common these days)... in fact, I can say, that the marketing campaign for this movie WAS DEFINITELY misleading, because had they make it clear that it was a bittersweet comedy, they would have had a more interested audience and not let some people down that came in with expectations of the next great comedy.This movie is more along the lines of "Knocked Up" which is funny but realistic take on life (although not as many people can relate to someone that married for the wrong reasons and realize it within a couple days of getting married).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back on the right track...almost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Misogynistic, conceited Eddie Cantrow (Ben Stiller) quickly realizes what a mistake he made in marrying Lila (Malin Akerman) and seeks to remedy the situation when he meets another girl while on his honeymoon in Mexico. Bobby and Peter Farrelly had much to redeem themselves for after the horrendously unfunny Stuck on You and simply blandly unfunny Fever Pitch, and this was a good return to form for them to attempt to recapture the glory that they attained from the mid-nineties through 2001. Well a good start anyway, as this film has a few flaws (the mere fact that Carlos Mencia is even in it is a huge minus) It's also more then a tad more sexist, misogynistic, and crass than any of their previous work, which might turn off many prospective viewers. However on a whole I did enjoy the film and laughed quite a few times. In full disclosure it's possibly that I enjoyed it more because the last film I saw in the theaters before this was Good Luck Chuck and pretty much ANYthing would've seemed great compared to that particular crap-fest.My Grade: B- Eye Candy: Malin Akerman shows boobs and bush, Kayla Kleevage shows her amazingly huge tits</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Comedy Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film should go down a comedy classic. First let me get the negatives out of the way, sometimes the film could be a little to juvenile(The Jellyfish Scene) and Jerry Stiller's character at times says random obscenities for a cheap laugh but other than that the film is great! Any other scene that may seem immature or juvenile is absolute gold! They are all well acted and give you a sense that you shouldn't be laughing yet can't stop. Ben stiller is still a great comedic actor, these are the kinds of films where his true genius shows. This is the film where he doesn't need to play a ridiculous Zoolander or Dodgeball character but play a realistic, nervous, uncouth type of character. The Farrely Brothers way of putting ridiculous comedy into normal situations is masterfully done, who would of thought watching someone be put into a headlock and then having a chili pepper shoved into their nose would be so hilarious? There may be plenty of swearing and crude comedy but it was right up my ally and any one who saw "Theres Something about Mary" will love this film to pieces. Another Farrely Brothers Classic!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>wow - when did Ben Stiller get so old?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i enjoyed this movie a lot. there were the typical ben stiller embarrassing situations and crazy laughs. perhaps too typical though :( the main character is the normal guy ben usually plays - its one main thing about him - he's lonely and looking for love. pressed by age, he dares and marries a girl he just met and barely knows, and going on their honey moon he begins to think he might have made a mistake so he meets another girl and...his heart switches ways... its kinda unfair to his newly wed wife, but this is the way Farrelly bros movies are -pretty harsh to the characters sometimes in order to squeeze some laughter from the dear audience. but the white hairs on Ben Stiller's head are hinting that may be the time for this kind of laugh is passing away... still its a very enjoyable movie, and i wouldn't go too deep into it, but on the very next day i went to a prescreen of "Good Luck Chuck" and I as well as everyone at the cinema literally laughed our asses off :) anyway - if you're a fan of ben stiller's do watch this movie. i am a big fan of his, and actually missed seeing him in a role like this, and enjoyed it a lot while watching it, but when you keep doing the same thing over and over again, there comes a moment when people want to see something new...and something new there usually is8/10have fun!peace</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So so bad!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is by far one of the worst movies iv ever seen. i am a projectionist at a very busy cinema so i see a lot of films, and i can tell you this one is terrible. its so bad that distributors Paramount didn't even bother making it properly... reel 1 of the 6 has out of sync sound!!! but that aside the movie is boring! all the bits that could have been funny were in the trailer so they're ruined... also i think there are certain parts of the movie that parents may want to know about before letting their kids go see it. the movie is rated 15 but there certain scenes and one word in particular that i feel should not be allowed in a 15 movie. i wouldn't see this movie again if i was paid to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I've seen this movie and it is amazing, please believe me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>i saw this movie at a screening about a month ago and it was the best comedy of all time, no joke. It was so funny there wasn't a minute between jokes to catch your breath. Ben stiller was amazing and it was so raunchy which made it even funnier. This movie is different from the original but SO AMAZING. if you want to see a funny movie with an unbelievable cast, see this one. You will not be let down by this movie it totally delivers. If you like raunchy comedy and smart filmaking this is the movie for you. please go see it! honestly, it is not exactly a romantic comedy it is just as dirty and funny as superbad and knocked up!!!!!! It is so much better than along came polly by the way :)</fullReview>
