		<shortDescription>Something A LOT different for Amanda Seyfried....6.5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me of the 90's wave of erotic thrillers. It's got all the elements, including a healthy dose of softcore sex scenes which surprised me because Amanda Seyfried has such an endearing, innocent look about her. But she's such a good actress though that this doesn't prevent her from convincingly playing the role of seductive call girl Chloe. Julianne Moore plays Catherine, a gynecologist who suspects her flirtatious husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair with one of his students. While at work Catherine observes Chloe entering and exiting hotels with several men so she can make a pretty good guess at Chloe's profession. Catherine decides to use Chloe as bait to see if her husband would submit to the temptation of an affair with Chloe.And even though that is the basic storyline, there is so much more that is left unsaid; things Catherine thinks she knows but doesn't know about her husband, things Chloe knows about Catherine that Catherine herself doesn't even know; and in the middle of it all, the viewer who finds out we didn't know much at all about it all. The audience is pretty much kept in the dark as to what is really going on with Chloe until one small scene that immediately switches the direction of the movie. It's not one of those hokey melodramatic twists, but will definitely have you playing back the entire movie in your mind because it sheds everything in a new light. Chloe brags at the beginning of the film, in a voice-over narration, that she has the gift of intuiting what people want and need without it being said. She can be all things to all people. And unfortunately for Julianne Moore's character, Chloe is exactly right....just not in the way that you might initially think she is.What makes this movie good is that it has layers. Just as in real life, people are inevitably much different than what they appear to be on the surface. In a lesser film, the characters and plot would be one-dimensional and by far less interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sexual thriller with a wow factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about a doctor who suspects her husband to be cheating. She hires a prostitute to test her suspicion, which spirals out of control beyond anyone's imagination.If there is a sub-genre called sexual thriller, "Chloe" would be the prototype. The plot works very well, it's very engaging. The sexual mystery and tension are captivating, and the copious nudity does not even come across as over the top or contrived. Just as you thought you guessed the whole plot, it twists in the most dramatic way. There is so much suspense, excitement and mystery to the story. "Chloe" is a very good film with a wow factor, that keeps me glued to the screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid erotic thriller even if predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When David (Liam Neeson) misses his flight home from New York and, as a result, the surprise party his wife Catherine (Julianne Moore) has planned for him, Catherine is forced to swallow her disappointment and any suspicions and return to the waiting guests. Reading a text message sent to David's phone the following morning from one of his female students, Catherine's fear grows. More suspicious than ever that David is having an affair, Catherine seeks out Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), an escort, hiring her to test David's fidelity.Chloe is a very solid thriller. Extremely engaging and incredibly entertaining, this story is ultimately about human nature and instincts. The film really grabs your attention and visually, it's quite a feat. The minimalistic sets and the way it was shot give this film a really modern and slick look. I feel like I should warn that there's quite a bit of nudity and somewhat graphic scenes but nothing outrageous or out of place.Moore was absolutely terrific, she has proved her value already but here she delivers possibly one of the best performances of her career. Seyfried was quite a surprise. Her performance was subtle but very efficient and she seems a very promising young actress. Liam Neeson was not nearly as good as he usually is but it's understandable considering his wife died during the shooting of the film.As I said, Chloe is a very solid and well done film. Unfortunately it has one major flaw, the predictably of the plot. I saw the twist coming from a mile way and I think any avid movie-goer will too. Still, it was a great watch, very entertaining and extremely well acted. Worth seeing.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Last night's review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw CHLOE last night. I love all of Atom Egoyan's films and this was no exception. We were warned going in that the movie was going to be sexually graphic. While this movie was highly erotic it was done extremely tastefully. Other directors would have gone more and cheapened it. Toward the end I was afraid we were heading for another Fatal Attraction but fortunately did not go that way. This was Julianne Moore's movie, no doubt, and I am rather surprised at the amount of nudity she showed. And Amanda Seyfried was HOT! Liam Neeson is almost a footnote in this film but he shows what a professional he is to do a film of this type after his family tragedy. I think this was the most erotic movie Egoyan's done since Exotica. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Textbook Egoyan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone was suited for remaking the French film Nathalie, it was Atom Egoyan, whose deeply twisted and occasionally perverse studies of sexuality, expressed through an apparently cold directorial eye, go hand in hand with a script that emphasized words over images (though there is a bit more flesh in the English-language transition). Hence the rather brilliant Chloe, whose prime accomplishment lies in its being less showy and pretentious than the director's previous foray into erotic secrets, the ambitious Where the Truth Lies.Set in Egoyan's home town of Toronto, Chloe tells the story of the eponymous call girl (Amanda Seyfried) who is hired by gynecologist Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) when the latter starts to suspect her husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair. Chloe's job is to casually approach him and see if he falls for her charm, thus indicating his propensity for adultery. However, as the girl's reports get more and more graphic, Catherine realizes she has put herself in an awkward position, one that it will be difficult to get out of.A fascinating hybrid between psychological drama and erotic thriller (there's a vague hint of Fatal Attraction throughout the movie), Chloe is a rarity due to its attempt to analyze sex and its consequences without necessarily resorting to openly titillating imagery (a characteristic Egoyan shares with another Canadian maestro, David Cronenberg). The only downside of this approach is the same flaw that was much more evident in Where the Truth Lies, namely a deliberately slow pace that affects the thriller aspects but enhances the emotional poignancy, something that comes off as a paradox given the seemingly cold subject matter.Furthermore, there is no coldness to be found in the carefully crafted performances: Neeson and Moore play the troubled couple with conviction, especially when things start getting more complicated (Moore's suspicious wife is a tour de force turn that should have received some award recognition), but the heart of the film lies, quite predictably, in Seyfried's hands, and she rises to the challenge by proving that she can do Big Love-style quality work on the big screen, embodying a complex, intriguing character light years away from her roles in Mamma Mia! and Mean Girls.Overall, Chloe is a very good movie: sexy without being gratuitous, psychological without getting pompous and, like its title character, delightfully surprising.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'I must find something, no matter how small, that I can love...'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan ('The Sweet Hereafter', 'Ararat', 'Where the Truth Lies') has a gift for setting up cinematic surveillance of private encounters and studying the results of an incident on everyone witnessing it. In CHLOE he has engaged the services of Erin Cressida Wilson to adapt the French film NATHALIE by Anne Fontaine to place it on this side of the pond. In the French version the successful actors were Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Béart, and Gérard Depardieu: for this version Egoyan has an equally superb cast to carry off this mysterious story with great success. The same question arises in both films: 'what is imagined and what is real?', and it is the getting there that makes this film so fascinating. Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is a gynecologist married to the successful professor of music David (Liam Neeson) and they have a stay-at-home hippie son Michael (Max Thieriot) who goes about his life much the same as his parents: there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship. The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine plans a surprise birthday party for David, a party David doesn't attend, and Catherine suspects David of having affairs, a fact that David apparently suggests by his flirtations with waitresses and 'help'. Catherine is shocked, but realizes that as she is aging this may be a normal situation in older marriages. Catherine visits a bar, a private club for assignations, and there she meets Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and eventually buys Chloe's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters. It is agreed that Chloe will be paid for her services and only go as far as Catherine instructs. From this point on Catherine and Chloe meet after Chloe has encounters with David and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Chloe for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with Chloe in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity. Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends. When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against David to leave him there is a final encounter of the three (Catherine, David, Chloe, and even son Michael) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending too fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story. Each of the actors does a star turn - Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried, and Liam Neeson - and once again Atom Egoyan takes an implausible story and makes us think. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I was worried that this movie would end up being the typical cheesy movie about betrayal and jealusy but after just a few minutes in to the movie I realised it was going to be much more.The movie is about a woman that's convinced her husband is cheating on her, and in her pursuit of the truth she looks for alternatives way to find out if her husband, who is away on work for long periods of time, is capable of betraying her.I won't go into more details on the story than this, and I don't think I need to. I will say this though; at times I thought I had it all figured out but I was wrong every time, and that's what made this thriller particularly interesting, as so many modern thrillers in this genre generally doesn'y deliver much excitement.Very good acting, believable characters as well as an interesting development in the story. I really enjoyed this movie, and I think you will too. 8/10! .. and did I mention there is nudity? Enough said, watch this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an intense drama about sexual identification and fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes a story needs to just let its characters go where the situation takes them. A situation isn't always conducive to storytelling (telling a story vs. a situation), but in the case of Chloe it's the way to go. The situation here is this: a doctor (Julianne Moore) is suspicious, perhaps even certain in some way, that her husband, an opera teacher (Liam Neeson) is cheating on her. As a way to find out, or just out of curiosity as to what he'll do, he approaches a call-girl (Amanda Seyfried) who has a knack for fulfilling any client's desire. When Chloe asks this woman about her husband being the client, she says he isn't. Her job will be to approach him, simply, in a cafe and see what he does. But according to Chloe, an innocent conversation (him being "friendly" as he is with a lot of women) turns into something else entirely... or is it? This situation unfolds in a manner that is less about the conventional 'what will happen to their marriage' than what will happen to Moore's character, and Seyfried's Chloe, in relation to one another. It's one thing to have a character having sex with one spouse, but then having it with the other is something else. But that's not even what Atom Egoyan, the director, is fully interested in (although the sex scenes, when they do come up, usually from Moore's gynecologist imagining what her husband has been doing - and then herself actually with Chloe, are the most seriously erotically charged ones seen in a while). His concern, as a storyteller with this 'situation' is what is in the mind, what perception does to a married couple over time.Catherine can imagine David doing these things, and we as the audience accept this as what really happened because Chloe, as the in-charge girl of the fantasy, makes it so. What do we perceive as who's wrong or right here, or is there even that issue? Eventually the movie Chloe turns into an obsession kind of story, where Chloe becomes enraptured with Catherine and their tryst together. A third-act revelation (I hesitate to call it a twist) makes things a lot more clearer, but does it matter if one sees it coming (I didn't, but I can see how suspicions can be had right from the beginning). It's Egoyan's way of seeing these people in these situations, how serious everything is taken but how it doesn't become too trashy; only the music by Mychael Danna sees to make it more of a sleek erotic drama when it doesn't need it (the best music cue has nothing to do with him, but rather the cutaway from one crucial scene to the next where Catherine/David's son is playing a perfectly somber piece of piano at a recital).One part of it is the camera, sliding along and pairing up the imagery in certain scenes (watch as Catherine is excited in the shower of the image of David in the botanical garden, their juxtaposition is interesting). But another crucial thing is the performances. Moore and Neeson deliver the goods, and we hope they always do (Neeson especially has a very hard part, despite the supporting role as the husband, since he has to reveal what is necessary for Catherine to perceive, not so much what is fully realistic), and the actor playing the son fares less well, though that may be due to him being underwritten (or just not well written enough). But it's Seyfried who comes away here the real winner; she's naturally sexy and appealing, and can convey Chloe's ability to play Catherine so well because it's what she does. She's younger but wiser when it comes to intimacy and the power of suggestion, and the details in her descriptions, in the writing and the acting, is totally solid. We've seen Seyfried try, and sometimes succeed, more or less with material (i.e. Mean Girls and Jennifer's Body), and here is where she really, fully gets to shine in a three-dimensional character.We know the players and we know how it might turn out, but you can't be sure. Egoyan eschews a Fatal Attraction third act turn for something a little more dangerous and exciting. I wasn't sure if Chloe was nuts, or just got off on her own superior way of playing this family of bourgeois Toronto-ites. It's about knowing what we know, and what we choose to do with that information as a sexual partner, a lover, a person, a friend, whatever, and that intimate fantasy element. It comes close to trash, but it really isn't. Taking its flaws aside, it's one of the smartest adult (though not pornographic) thrillers in recent memory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where's Shannon Tweed?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A great cast are wasted on a pretty dire script. I suppose they thought they were making something insightful about the nature of trust or something, but it's a pretty average thriller which retreads the same path so many other thrillers have. I must admit I found it rather annoying that we are shown scenes that didn't happen (yes, I know none of it actually happened!). It would have been more acceptable to me if the scenes of Chloe's imagined relationship with the David, the husband (Liam Neeson) had been given a voice-over by her. That would have indicated that the action could have been taking place in her head. It was very Hollywood, in spite of its pretensions to being meaningful. For example, Julianne Moore's character Catherine is worried that she's getting old, but this being Hollywood she's not allowed to look anything other than stunning for the majority of the time. Plus, she indulges in a bit of lesbianism at the drop of a hat because we all know that every woman has an inner lesbian dying to get out. Honestly, you could have cast Shannon Tweed in the role! Chloe's motivation seemed very vague. She's a prostitute, so I suppose we are meant to take that as shorthand for her being a DAMAGED PERSON. I came to the conclusion that she was after Catherine's wardrobe. Chloe wears endless pretty outfits (she seems to have a limitless number of coats) and has a shoegasm whilst being diddled by Catherine's son. She won't look at him, but fixes her gaze on Moore's shoes and clothes (she's being diddled in Catherine's bedroom btw). It had a typical Hollywood ending, the outside influence who is trying to break up the family unit is killed. The only surprising thing about it was that she wasn't stabbed with the antique hair slide that we'd been shown several times. It reminded me of those yuppie-in-peril films of the late 80s/early 90s like Consenting Adults and Pacific Heights.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why no mention of "Nathalie" ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just watched the Making Of interviews on the DVD of Chloe and am mystified as to why the director and screenwriter make absolutely no mention of the original French film "Nathalie" upon which Chloe is based. In fact, the American screenwriter has copied many of the words and situations directly from the original version, including the wife's profession of gynaecologist. I think this has to be the worst form of plagiarism ever. "Nathalie" is a far more subtle and erotic movie and I would like everyone to know that neither the story nor the screenplay of the American version originate with Erin Cressida Wilson or Atom Egoyan. It is disingenuous of these American filmmakers to not even mention the French film. How does everyone else feel about being misled?</fullReview>

It was so enjoyable to see Toronto finally shot AS TORONTO. It is also noteworthy that Liam Neeson courageously filmed a portion of this movie after the tragic death of his wife. With wild twists and turns. I saw this at the Toronto film festival and couldn't have been more pleasantly surprised by the result. Also, keep an eye out for the up and coming actor Max Theriot. He's going to be someone to look out for. Julianne Moore also rings in a great acting performance with her great control of a woman who's life begins to spiral out of control.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Atom Egoyan behind Chloe is not 100% the auteur behind films like Erotica and The Sweet Hereafter, but he weaves it in the right direction, and the end result may be his most erotic film yet. Ergo, Chloe feels like enough of an Egoyan film for me to argue that going commercial is not something that will degrade the quality of his work, (although I can't say much for Where the Truth Lies.) Dr. Catherine Stewart suspects her husband is cheating on her, so she hires a local prostitute to seduce him, and report back with news. The things that Chloe has to say really turn on Dr. Stewart, and the two women start to fall for each other. But when Catherine decides it is time to pull the plug, Chloe isn't so eager to go away.Chloe grows increasingly eerie, and profound, which draws you in, but in the last twenty minutes, it comes close to falling apart. I know there are those out there who love Egoyan's inexplicable content, and those who don't. Whether you like or dislike Chloe, I think I can guarantee this at least; It will give you something to think about for the rest of the day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was great to see the crowd for this film at my local cinema. Yes, the reviews for this look like they are all over the map. But let it be said that without this fantastic casting (Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson and Amanda Seyfried-a powerful erotic trio), the glorious cinematography and the wildly gorgeous sound track, it might be all of what these arm chair critics are saying. We live only a few miles from Canada by air but it might as well be Istanbul in the hands of this director. Magically the city of Toronto in winter is like another world, with a sleek modern feel that is alluring and cold at the same time. This is the perfect setting for a movie rich in the cloaked emotion of the upper class, lost in a deep freeze. Watching the film in spring in California, makes it seem even more unreal and foreign. In this landscape of ice, we see the characters emerge as modern people lost, alienated, hungary for love and even just human touch. This is a movie of antithesis, and startling allusions of the duality between trust and fear, openness and truth and the hard fact of emotional allusion and mirror like dreams. This film has nothing to do with Hitchcock and everything to do with Bunuel, and the deep wave of surrealist magic still washing on the shore of French thought and culture. Yes the ending is dubious, but it can't crush your response. For those of you wide awake enough to enjoy this, you will be rewarded in ways that American directors rarely seem to reach. What I say is bravo!I believe that for these moments, such dreams are very real.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally risible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>CHLOE is the most risible film I've seen since, well, WHERE THE TRUTH LIES. The story is totally whacked and one wonders who in their right mind thought this story made any sense: a spoiled rich gynecologist believes her husband is cheating on her. She suddenly feels invisible: her husband is having sex with one of his young students. Friends are dating young chicks. Her son his sleeping with a hot chick in his bedroom. People all around are boinking chicks. The wife suddenly realizes "Heck, I'm missing on all of the hot action" so she decides to hire a hooker, with the idea of seducing her husband to see if he'll sleep with her, but it's all a ruse really because she's the one who ends up having sex with Chloe the Hooker. Chloe invents all these "hot" stories of her sleeping with the husband, to dupe the silly wife; these stories are so hot the wife decides to have sex with the hooker, because the wife feels she's invisible and by having sex with Chloe it's like some transference thingy going on and part of the passion the husband is sharing with the hooker the wife thinks she'll feel it too.Got that? The logic in the story is so whacked, it had me rolling on the floor.First of all, I can't sympathize/empathize with the wife's pain/grief. She's a wealthy spoiled woman who hires a young woman to trap her husband. Nice character.Second, the couple is a corny couple. Who cares if they don't make it or anything about their happiness.Third, the two women, the silly wife and the hooker, are shown as being total nut jobs: the wife is gullible and accepts every little detail the hooker tells her without any proof of what she's claiming is real and the hooker is shown as being mentally unstable in the SINGLE WHITE FEMALE kind of way.So basically the degrading screenplay portrays these two neurotic women as crazy, conniving, manipulating, narcissistic and out of control with their emotions. They both end-up coning each other while object of the initial target, the boring husband, doesn't even figure in the story. The two scheming women end up looking like two monkeys fellating each other at the zoo. I wanted to throw peanuts at them to make them stop. The ending elevates the level of degradation when Chloe the Hooker sleeps with the son in the parents' bedroom and when they're found out Chloe the Hooker then tries to seduce the wife again, which is seen by her son. The wife, embarrassed, literally pushes Chloe away to her death. Nice.Though the story hints at Pasolini's brilliant TEOREMA, the storyline is straight out of the 1970s Black Emanuelle trash epics. Well, I would rather watch any Laura Gemser flick than this risible piece of "serious" filmmaking. The sex scenes in CHLOE were not hot for one second. Just unconvincing.When the wife suddenly realizes the truth with those fake encounters Chloe has been telling her, she tells the clueless husband what she did: that she hired a hooker to entrap him and that she also ended up having sex with her (and in turn became the cheater here), the husband shrugs it off as if it was normal and OK. Again, this is me on the floor laughing my butt off. If I was the husband, I'd ask the wife to seek professional psychiatric help. I mean, the money she spent on the hooker could have been spent on something more important, ya know, like a brand new flat screen TV for that ridiculously overly designed house of theirs. Even though it's a remake of a French film CHLOE reminded me more of the trashy Italian film called DELERIUM starring Mickey Hargitay. Same insane logic in the storyline with the women being completely crazy and degraded. The excellent Julianne Moore needs to get better projects than this laughable &amp; embarrassing stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Cop Out for Conventionality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Convention triumphs over the unexpectedly exposed and terrifying truth of the self in Atom Egoyan's contemporary marriage mystery. A female gynecologist?a professional trained to look inside the bodies of women to reveal their truth, and perhaps something of their essence?suspects her husband of infidelity. She hires a Lolita look-alike call girl to entice her husband to determine his betrayal tendencies. The husband, a college instructor, and flirt, denies aging by intentionally missing his flight to home on his birthday, thwarting his wife's surprise birthday party arrangements. Their relationship has died?he now devotes himself to teaching, and is apathetic about the burned-out marital passion; she walks around in frustration, and flails about in response to her ineffectual attempts to her marriage emptiness. While it appears the husband is at least getting his physical needs met, the couple's mentally ill teenage son is obviously the only one in this upper middle class bare semblance of a family getting any for sure. His mother, jealous of her son's liaisons, but actually confronted by her own passionless life by his success, fails to connect, too, with the other familial male ?her son. This woman, apparently successful at discerning the nature, or at least the core female health of her professional clients, has lost the capacity to know herself, and how to know herself. The prostitute reports her 'findings' face-to-face to the wife, which arouses her. The young woman, played effectively with big blue eyes and mouthy nuance by Amanda Siegfried, notes the wife's subtle arousal signals. The wife surprises herself with her responses to the descriptive tales of liaison, but the girl's got an unrevealed plan. The wife comes to the discovery of her true sexual nature, but without revealing the whys of her rejection of it, falls back to conventionality. The movie's ending cops out to the truth, revealing once again Hollywood's immense incapacity for encouraging honest living, or at least genuine acknowledgment of the truth, and the cost of its ignorance. © Bruce Stern, April 2010</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting, but not very memorable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I confess that I usually find the erotic thrillers to be tedious and pretty laughable.However, there is a more "artistic" category I would call as "psico-sexual drama"; into the category, I would include films such as Closer; Eyes Wide Shut; Lust, Caution; and Crash (1996).That division is merely subjective, but I think it obeys to the obvious difference in the filmmakers' intention; let's say that while the erotic thriller simply relies on a soap-opera screenplay of passion and intrigue in order to justify the nudity from the cast, the "psico-sexual drama" is more interested in the causes of that passion and the consequences the characters suffer when they are unable to rationally control it.The film Chloe dangerously gets near the most sordid extreme from the balance, but the excellent performances and Atom Egoyan's sober direction are what rescue it.The screenplay from Chloe is not very original, and the "surprise" revelation from the final minutes is predictable.However, the film is interesting, specially thanks to the intense work from the three main actors: the great Julianne Moore expresses the deepest emotions from her character with minimum effort and maximum impact; Liam Neeson also brings a credible and very detailed work; and Amanda Seyfried displays the big histrionic talent she could not show in crappy romantic films like Letters to Juliet and Dear John.And besides of the performances, Egoyan drives the movie at a good rhythm and he could bring a good atmosphere to it.And I think that his work, along with the perfect performances, make Chloe to be worthy of a recommendation, despite the various fails from the screenplay and the fact of not being highly memorable.I do not think this one is among Egoyan's best films (which are, from what I have seen from his filmography and my humble point of view, Ararat and The Sweet Hereafter), but I think it is an interesting addition to his career.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are so many things wrong with this movie it's difficult to know where to begin slamming it.Right off the bat; the overall cadence is painfully slow with scenes taking too long to complete. The musical score is a boring drone with an occasional series of annoying banging on what sounds like a garbage can, where this movie ultimately belongs. Surround sound edits such as left speaker actress, right speaker actress are sophomoric and ineffective and, also, actually annoying. The scenery of Ontario is that of a small street mall shot on wintery, cloudy days, not much to look at.Now for the horrible plot: Wife finds photo message from girl thanking hubby for good time when he shoulda been at her surprise b-day party. Logically, wife hires prostitute to test hubbys fidelity. What we know instinctually and right away is that prostitute is crazy and makes it all up but, without any discernible motive, stalks family and ultimately does the wife, the son and then kills herself by falling thru an extremely flimsy window.Chloe manages at first to convince Dr Stewart, in graphic detail, the sexual escapades her adulterating husband enjoyed which leads the lovely Dr to retain the psycho for yet another job never approaching her husband with what she apparently already knew; he's a cheater, but he isn't really, after all it's Liam Neeson who's never been a bad guy in any of his films, part of his contract I guess.OK, we're not totally un-entertained, we get to see Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore in the buff getting it on. Dr. Stewart thought it would be a good idea to have sex with the prostitute since, after all, she's a gynecologist and can probably tend to the removal of STDs on her own. We also see Amanda Seyfried do the son and climax looking at belongings of his mother; Dr. Gyno, Chloe's real love for some unexplained reason, good gynecology? Who knows? The holes here in logic exercised by an educated overpaid professional are too much to swallow. The lack of motive by Chloe and the interference with her presumed income is also confusing but in the end we get to see the hair clip given to the Dr by the hooker pinned to her smiling head as the movie fades into oblivion, where it needs to stay. I suppose the hair pin could be to blame for the evil that was done as it's apparently a center piece of film, but they just don't clue us into that. Maybe the soft porn scenes consumed all the resources? Don't waste your time on this trash. Unless you're into girl on girl, in which case, look to Moore, she's got a much better body than Amanda Seyfried</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst movie I have seen in a long while...horrible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's the point of watching a movie which partly consists of a person telling a story which eventually happens to be untrue? Especially if the lie is so obvious that the viewer (at least I was) is totally bored waiting for the truth to be revealed to Julianne Moore. Is the director trying to trick us into believing that Chloe's story is true? If he does I am a bit offended at him for thinking me so stupid. It's such a cliché-narrative, it has been done so many times in similar ways that you would have to make quite an effort for it to be believable. Its like watching a 6th Sense remake. Who would want to watch it if the whole final effect of 'oh my god, he is a ghost' is gone?As the viewers, are we supposed to be surprised that it all was just made up? Because I wasn't surprised at all. I was just extremely annoyed because it all was so painfully obvious.The director is trying to unfold a story which is already unfolded in my mind before the first half is even over because it is predictable and lame.But this is just one aspect which I did not like. There is so much more wrong with this movie that I could go on forever.I could accept the flaw I just tried to point out if the rest of the movie was watchable, but it's not.It's a movie about a hooker (or escort girl or what ever you want to call her) who turns out to have emotional problems; so while in the beginning she is acting all cool and telling us so intelligently and poetically about her job, about the dos and don'ts and how to behave with men, in the end she turns out to not be professional at all, she is just a crazy bitch. Julianne has some emotional problems because she is getting old and feels unwanted. Her son is just some teenage kid who is not really relevant for the movie except for the conflict with Chloe in the end. Liam Neeson is just chilling throughout the movie not really harming anyone, he seems to be more interested in his work than in his wife...wtfhonestly, who cares?I suppose there is supposed to be some underlying deeper meaning...But I think its a load of ...just a pretentious attempt to be smart and intellectual. All the director does is coming up with some random drama-conflict ideas and mixing them together. in the end you have nothing of value...I usually don't write reviews on IMDb; this is the first one. The movie just created so many negative emotions within me that I had to post my opinion. Especially after seeing how many people liked it. I mean, that's fine. We all have different tastes, but I just thought I post one for the people who disliked the movie as much as i did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something implausible and artificial about the main characters, with their sexual promiscuity and lack of any trace of moral backbone.I am not saying that every one in the movie should be a saint, but the movie feels as if Atom has two bags.First bag, contains the following concepts/ideas/patterns: sexual promiscuity, sexual craving, deep hidden lesbian tendencies, insecurity, desperate need to be loved, no financial worries, loyalty, nice house, lot of time time to kill, can bang any woman in sight, can bang any man in sight, be good at both, have or have not feelings when you do it, capable of love.Second bag: woman gynecologist who spends most of her time inspecting other women's vaginas, university teacher, horny young guy, escort girl.Atom probably closed his eyes and combined randomly items from the first bag with items from the second bag. And the result is this movie which feels like a soup made from the content of a pig's stomach.As much as I wanted I could not identify with any of these characters. I found them and the universe in which they operated artificial and contrived.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chloe is an erotic thriller that's essentially a tamer lesbian version of Fatal Attraction. Comparing it to Fatal Attraction it comes off badly as never really gets that gritty and tense, but, in its own right, it's a good movie with plenty to offer... like Amanda Seyfried's chest.Whilst it was predictable and formulaic I certainly can't say I was ever bored. I'm probably being far too generous with my rating due to loving the lezzing up and Amanda Seyfried's rather excellent rack but it's worth watching just for the scene where the Chloe character has an orgasm over a rack of shoes; had me pissing myself. So for those who have an appreciation for Amanda Seyfried and her awesome rack and lesbian sex then this is a 7; if not then a 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is probably the worst film I've seen this year despite having a lesbian scene! It has a predictable climax, before descending into a ridiculous finale. Before then, there is gratuitous sex... in the form of descriptions and scenes. This includes a barely believable lesbian scene between Julianne Moore's character, and 'Chloe' who has bedded her husband at her request. Except Chloe hasn't really. She made up fictional encounters with the husband just to make Julianne (sorry, can't remember her name in the film) jealous and upset. When Julianne realises the truth, Chloe is busy seducing their son. Then Julianne and Chloe have a confrontation in Julianne's bedroom (her son and Chloe are lying in bed), resulting in Chloe falling out of a window to her death.Don't bother, really.</fullReview>

Her beauty is natural (which is a rare thing in Hollywood), her acting is convincing and this role wasn't any exception.The story itself doesn't open any new pages in history of human relations especially within long-time marriage. What makes this movie so powerful isn't so much the dialog or the story but the acting itself. There is some nudity and lighter sex scenes involving Amanda Seyfried which are most welcomed. It is high-class scenes with deep emotional content rather than college-girl boobs flashing. This is definitely the sexiest drama movie I've seen in a long time, hands down.I give this movie the highest score! The movie is breath-taking!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore And Neeson Elevate The Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chloe is an erotic thriller film is a remake of the French film," Nathalie....".This version stars Julianne Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried in the title role. The screenplay was written by Erin Cressida Wilson, based on said earlier French film, written by Anne Fontaine.It was written by Atom Egoyan.An untrusting wife attempts to prove that her husband is cheating by hiring an escort to seduce him, inadvertently endangering her entire family in the process. Catherine is a respected doctor, and her husband, David, is a dedicated music professor. They've been married for years and have a teenage son together, but lately the passion has faded from their romance. The morning after David misses his flight home -- and the elaborate surprise birthday party Catherine had planned to celebrate his return -- Catherine finds a text message on his phone that leads her to believe her husband is sleeping with a female student. Her suspicions grow over the following weeks, and when Catherine has a run-in with an escort named Chloe, she hires the ravishing blonde to test her husband's fidelity. After each encounter with David, Chloe reports back to Catherine with all the sordid details. But the further the experiment goes, the less clear Chloe's motivations for taking part in it become, and the more the untrusting wife begins to fear that the situation has spiraled out of control.This is a high-toned erotic thriller, handled with style and some emotionally raw scenes, aiming for an effect that's pleasingly unnerving, if not outright arousing.Unfortunately,it starts off as an intriguing psychological drama with an intriguing premise but then veers off into B-movie territory.But nevertheless,Moore and Neeson are such classy actors that their performances elevate the material.Overall,it still a better-than-average film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe or Nathalie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chloe" (2009) directed by Atom Agoyan is the remake of the French film Nathalie... (2003) made by Anne Fontaine with Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Béart, and Gérard Depardieu, as three participants of erotic thrilling psychological drama. Chloe follows the Nathalie's footsteps quite closely. The difference is in the final act, and I prefer Nathalie's ending. All Atom Agoyan and the rest of Chloe's creators had to do to make it a truly great movie -was just to remake step by step the French original. The most amazing thing about Nathalie... was its palpable erotic tension on the screen and at the same time, the lack of steamy sex scenes which was more than compensated with the subtle communication between two women, older, Catherine and younger, Nathalie and between Catherine (Ardant) and her husband of many years (Depardieu) whom she still loves but does not know anymore how to make them both happy.Both movies run almost the same time, French film - 100 minutes, and North American -96 but I prefer the intelligent, insightful, nuanced, implying and not shoving in your face the sensational fatal attraction ending film Nathalie. It is not to say that Chloe is worthless. It is gorgeous to look at, and three main actors, Julian Moore, Liam Neeson, and Amanda Seyfried all gave very good performances. The young Amanda Seyfried was a very worthy screen partner to Juliana Moore who can do no wrong to me. I was especially impressed by Amanda's face and how it changes from young and innocent to sexy and seductive, resentful, dangerous in a course of seconds. The problem of Chloe is its script which goes weak and out of breath in the final part. The final of Chloe makes me think that the authors of the film don't trust their audiences and feed us with sex, melodrama, and very unsatisfying a la fatal attraction climax because they are afraid we don't get the subtleties that made the original film so thrilling. Another problem I have with Chloe is the character of Catherine and David's son, Michael. He existed in the French film but on the background. In Nathalie, he left his parents' house and from what I could judge, he had quite normal relationship with them which allowed the plot to concentrate primarily on the unusual and quite fascinating relationship between Catherine and the call girl Nathalie whom she hired to find out if her husband cheats on her and what he actually expects from a woman. In the film Chloe, the character of Michael was annoying, and in the end his only purpose was to justify unsatisfying final act of the film. Chloe - 5.5/10, Nathalie - 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie but totally predictable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by stating that I loved this movie. It had good acting, good set and scene design, and a great story. That being said, don't expect anything new. One reviewer said that it was a good movie with a twist at the end. I can unequivocally tell you that there is no twist. In fact, it is hugely obvious that Julianne Moore is being played the second time she meets with Chloe and from there you can easily predict where the rest of the movie was going. In fact, from that point I was anxiously awaiting the lesbian love scene and it cued on a little later than I anticipated. Even so, the movie was a fun ride anyway. Another reviewer stated that he/she was worried that the movie would be cheapened by going Fatal Attraction at the end but fortunately that didn't happen. I don't know what brand of Crack this reviewer was smoking, but the movie totally went Fatal Attraction at the end. In fact, the only thing missing was the dead cat in a pot of boiling water. Like I said, it's a great movie and definitely worth watching if you haven't seen it before, but don't expect any huge surprises (other than seeing Jullian Moore in all of her naked beauty).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>talent wasted on an awful story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am sometimes wondering about the bad choices made by one director or the other, or by one actor or another. When such a gathering of talents like Atom Egoyan - director of Ararat, Liam Neeson - star of Schindler's List or Julianne Moore - four time nominated for an Oscar, share the same bad choice I am simply stunned. None of them is visibly on the decreasing slope of their respective careers, none was known to have huge debts to be obliged to accept any role, so why picking a film based on such a stupid and incredible story, with a bad taste that comes close to soft porn - and this is not because of the quantity of skin shown on screen but because the way the story is being told.Actually the story of Chloe is so stupid it is worth being told in a few sentences. Suppose you are a successful gynecologist and you suspect that your husband of at least 20 years cheats on you. What is more natural than hiring a hooker to check on his behavior and tell you in details how she makes 'progress' in the relation with the husbie? When you are told that the inevitable happened you start being attracted by the hooker, or maybe it's just revenge, or curiosity, but soon you will end by you cheating on your husband with her. And this is not all but I will spare the rest. Chloe not being the only strange relationship film coming from Northern border, the only question it arises to me is are really these Canadian such disturbed personalities, when it comes to intimate and family relations? If yes, I must have met the wrong and not-interesting Canadians during all my life.The lead actors do their best but they seem all a little bit uncomfortable with the story and their roles. Julian Moore of all has the most difficult task, as she needs to give some credibility to the most unbelievable relationship story - she is brave and succeeds up to the point of making sense of her relationship with Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) whose motivations we never find out excepting the basic fact that she is really a Bad Girl. Egoyan makes at some point a directorial mistake which taking into account his talent I cannot believe to be unintentional, filming imagined scenes as a real ones - I call this cheating on audiences and I did not like it. There is a final twist that is supposed to create a persistent feeling of uneasiness in the audiences, but this feeling actually starts much earlier and for the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

The girl does get around.Liam and Julianne are a pair of forty somethings, successful professionals both who've gotten bored with the marriage. Julianne catches Liam from a window with another woman as he blows off a big birthday party. As he explains he didn't want to be reminded that he was a year older and closer to the Grim Reaper.So what to do and what Julianne decides on is to hire Amanda Seyfried who is a pro and let her seduce the husband and find out what can turn him on. That she does and later gets to turn on both Julianne and their son Max. One way or another Seyfried is going to get involved in that family. Quite a story, the only one I ever heard like it was Bella Darvi who got to the whole Zanuck family at some point.I have to say that the sex scenes that were done, were done tastefully. But in the end Chloe is not that far above soft core porn. It's also acted well, but nothing to rush out and see if you have more than prurient interest.</fullReview>

The problem with this movie is that it is yet another piece of feminist propaganda, freshly minted from the hands of our ultra-liberal friends in Hollywood. I am beginning to think that I am never going to see a movie with intelligent male characters who can't be manipulated or out-smarted by women. It looks like Hollywood is determined to convince women that all men are morons who can be duped by any set of tits they see. They also want to convince women that immoral and destructive sexual behaviors like adultery and promiscuity (which are common among men) is something they should strive to emulate.

Her plan to tempt her husband backfires (no kidding- on what planet does this seem like a good idea) putting their entire family in danger.As far as sexual thrillers go this was okay. I guess I expected it to be better with Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson attached but it just never really gets going. In fact once the thriller element kicks in which is when this should have moved into high gear it fails almost completely, heading into dry, weird, almost B-movie territory. On the plus side the sexual mystery and tension are captivating, I mean I wanted to see how this was going to play out even if my mind did wander occasionally. There are dark psychological twists, manipulation and its scary in a 'Fatal Attraction' sort of way. Liam Neeson takes almost a secondary role here as this is more about the women. Julianne Moore is as always excellent and Amanda Seyfried in one of her breakout roles is scene stealing in her influence and deception. Erotic I guess, but forgettable and the ending... quick and tidy. Filmed in (and actually takes place) in Toronto. 12/29/15</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I've been told good about "Chloe" for a long time, and last week I decided watching it. From the get go, I could feel there was something about Chloe that would be eventually discovered. Chloe is a girl that gets paid in order to find out if the husband is cheating on the wife. However, things don't go according to plan, and all of a sudden, Chloe is hooking up with the whole family; for some reason, she is capable of seducing everyone out there, albeit she never confesses it. In her opinion, she is just being used by everybody. In this context, Seyfried's character is very covert, causing a BIG mess to each member of the family, and maybe that's why this movie feels so intense. Julianne Moore's character, for instance, gets SO mad and perplexed with Chloe's power to manipulate her that she can't even express it; instead of yelling at her, Dr. Catherine Stewart just pays more money and asks Chloe's, gently, to leave her alone. Maybe that happens because Catherine is just too scared to carry that on. Anyways, the film is great when trying to show how far people can go to reinvent their lives, and the professional cast is quite able to transmit all the feelings they are supposed to be dealing with.</fullReview>

Well, apparently, the kind who enjoys the sight of a naked Amanda Seyfried and Julianne Moore getting fruity in bed together. He's not wrong either! I imagine that's the sort of thing guaranteed to pique most men's interest in a film.But there's more to Chloe than quality titillation featuring hot Hollywood actresses having sex: the film also adds a rather compelling tale of betrayal and deceit into the mix, one that develops in a manner that caught me completely off guard (I wasn't expecting any surprises, but Chloe manages to pull off a really good one that successfully turns the tale on its head).The cast are all excellent, with Seyfried particularly impressive as the seductive hooker, proving beyond a doubt that she's not just a pretty face (for starter's, she has a smoking body!); Moore and Neeson are, as one would expect, totally convincing as a married couple at a crossroads in their relationship. Atom Egoyan's measured direction may prove a little leisurely for some, but I imagine that many viewers will hang on regardless to get to the best part?which comes fairly late on?and be pleasantly surprised by how good the film is as a whole.</fullReview>

Maybe it was that every element, from the story and attention to conflict, to the masterful selection of Toronto as the sympathetic backdrop to this tension-filled and wonderfully shot film, to the incredible selection of talent, but whatever it was, the product is a cut above this director's previous work, and, really, stands head and shoulders above most films in the genre.An erotic thriller is a challenge in itself. Here we're presented with sex itself as violence, where subtlety and nuance mean everything. A lesser attempt would have led with shock, but Chloe works her way into your heart softly, gently, and stealthily. This movie is tense, penetrating and worth watching.

		<shortDescription>A Well Made Psychological Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chloe" is listed under the drama, mystery and thriller genres. It starts as a psychological drama. Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) is a young woman whose path happens to cross that of Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore). Later, Catherine--who is a gynecologist--observes Chloe on the street from her office window and realizes that Chloe is a prostitute.The young woman is beautiful and she seems to possess some control over her life, which looks passionate and glamorous from afar. Catherine's life is rather sterile. She lives in a glass and metal house with a son who prefers to ignore her and a husband, David (Liam Neeson), who always has excuses to avoid intimacy and to be away from home.Catherine suspects her husband of infidelity. When she watched Chloe on the street, she wondered if her husband could resist the young woman's charms. Chloe and Catherine meet again, in a bar. Catherine--who by now is obsessed with the conviction that her husband is disloyal--asks if she can purchase Chloe's services in an experiment to see if David will succumb to temptation. And thus the trap is set.It was to be a one-time lure, but Catherine wants irrefutable proof and hires Chloe again. Eventually, Catherine gets what she is looking for. Or does she want something more from the mysterious siren Chloe?Catherine's girlfriends think she is having an affair. The covert nature of the relationships between the three characters evolves into a dance of intrigue. The film now becomes a mystery. Chloe injects herself into every aspect of the couple's lives. What is her intention?I don't think the story ever becomes a thriller, but the psychological drama plays out till the film's final moments. The film is well made and well acted. Amanda Seyfried uses the ill-timed laugh and the inappropriate comment to keep the viewer off-balance. Portions of the film seem Hitchcockian. We are never sure where the story will lead and there are twists that surprise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting parable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really two stories: The one in which Catherine suspects her husband of being unfaithful and hires Chloe to put him to the test (which has been comprehensively reviewed here already). And Chloe's story.There are several clues to Chloe's identity, including several events which correspond to Stations of the Cross (including falling in the street, having the palm of her hand punctured and her self sacrifice with arms outstretched in a crucifix position, with winter trees in the background). Also, Chloe uses Christ like metaphors throughout, even when being disparaging of internet downloads; "A CD that you can keep for ever and hold in your hands." These lines don't seem at all cheesy due to the sincerity of Amanda Seyfried's performance.The silver hairpin seems to be symbolic of Chloe's calling. She didn't want to keep giving of herself to others and wanted to give the hairpin to Catherine, who at first refuses it.The dates on the messages from Chloe are from the last week in March, even though we frequently see Christmas decorations. The days progress from Wednesday through to Friday (presumably Good Friday). But the dates go backwards from the 27th to the 25th, and I am guessing that this represents the rebirth of Catherine on a (metaphorical) Christmas day, when she will take over Chloe's role in life and wear the hairpin (halo or crown of thorns).There is a recurring motif of bare trees. We even see them on the stage where the band is rehearsing. These trees give the film a beautiful, melancholy look.Overall this is well directed and acted, but the best achievement is Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay which combines intelligent story telling with an abstract subplot full of religious imagery.</fullReview>

Honestly, I didn't fully grasp what I'd seen the first time. I enjoy thought inspiring, emotional and moralistic tales and this hit the nail on the head; I was really surprised. The chemistry between the characters is very real and I thought Julian Moores performance was first class. She dresses down so even her pretty moments she looks quite plain and she opens up as a lonely housewife, regardless of her characters professional success in this very bold role. I'm not a fan of nudity in film as I often feel it's cheap, unless it's a corny B movie then it's as expected as the female protagonist running from danger and falling, but in this case, as with Madeline Stowes' 'Blink', it was tasteful and dramatic. To enjoy the spirit of the characters I actually found the intimate scenes difficult to watch due to their realism. There is love, identity and purpose in this story and all actors excelled thanks to their personal abilities, a great story and director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My take is far better than the "experts."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film on TV and Diane thought that it was good; I just thought it was better. Obviously the actors were outstanding while the remainder of the film was virtually equally as excellent. The fact that the script was from a French story filmed in Toronto, Canada made for fascinating settings; they were away from the now boring settings in New York and Southern California. The three and one half main characters (the half being the son) were superb by my standards; I thought they carried their roles excellently and therefore very believably. This is were the settings play such a large role; these settings played perfectly into this story line lending a more reasonable (believable?) direction to the entire film.This film is definitely worth a look in if the chance presents itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fun but preposterous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stylish thriller with good acting and nice settings.Unfortunately it is full of outlandish things that in real life would never happen:1) The wife suspects her husband is cheating, so she hires a prostitute to tempt him. Huh? What about talking to him? Or having him followed? Or checking his phone?2) The prostitute accepts the job. Huh? If word got out, this would ruin her business. Surely she would say no.3) The prostitute reports all sort of shenanigans with the husband, but the wife never asks for any proof that she was with him. Come on.4) The wife and husband have an ugly fight about their affairs, but the wife doesn't get around to mentioning the prostitute. Really?5) The prostitute makes up stories about her encounters with the husband, but she has no way of knowing that the husband isn't home at the time of the alleged encounters, or didn't call his wife to ask if he could stop at the grocery store. I guess she just got lucky.6) The prostitute fakes love affairs with multiple guys a night. This is her job. But somehow when she has sex with the wife, she becomes obsessed with her.7) The prostitute ends up in the couple's house, on the second floor, and lightly bumps the plate glass window, causing it to shatter. Huh? Was the house not built to code? I still enjoyed the movie, though some of my enjoyment was amusement at the utterly ridiculous plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It was a bit too much...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Initially I had expected somewhat more from this movie, but "Chloe" turned out to be a fairly mediocre experience for me, despite having a couple of good names to the cast list.The story does have a certain aspect to it which keeps you wondering about whether or not the events are actually happening, up to a certain point in the storyline where the movie just totally spirals out of control and becomes downright outrageous and over the top, and at that point my interest in the movie totally dwindled.Acting-wise, then "Chloe" was quite good; especially Julianne Moore (playing Catherine Stewart) really put on a great performance in the movie, and she was the one pulling the most weight in the movie, and without her performance, then "Chloe" would have been a lot more difficult to sit through and actually manage to stay awake.For people who enjoy a dramatic thriller that is heavy on the sexual aspect, then "Chloe" might be an overly enjoyable movie. But for the ones seeking entertainment in the ordinary sense, then "Chloe" tend to be a tad too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I came at this film knowing nothing about it except what I read on the back jacket and that it included the incredible actress Amanda Seyfried (pronounced Zi- freed). Man, what a ride. Seyfried plays a quirky prostitute that really aims to please. That pleasing is focused on the seemingly dejected wife of Liam Neeson, Julianne Moore. Rarely do you see a film that can capture eroticism with such accuracy. The film is art in motion. The trio of Seyfried, Mooore and Neeson portray real people with believable emotions and desires that raise raw sexuality to true everyday existence. The couples teenage son also adds a fresh approach to intimate encounters.The term "erotic thriller" really hits the mark as Seyfried walks a tightrope that envelopes you with thrills and chills. Her body is made for the cinema. Liam Neeson does not typically play the confused husband role but handles in deftly while Moore reveals the amazing range of her acting abilities. Not to be missed on a cozy night home with a lady friend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining fidelity character drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A doctor sets a honey trap with a young high-class working girl to test her husband's fidelity, however, the more she discovers the situation becomes complicated and breaking the deal becomes testing.Saucy well written yarn that is surprisingly engaging and more coherent than the likes of Bitter Moon (1992). Julianne Moore gives a solid performance reminiscent of Susan Sarandon in 1983's The Hunger. Amanda Seyfried delivers as subtle, edgy role, while injecting and uneasy innocence into the character of Chloe. She proves is a first rate actress. Liam Neeson chews though his lines and is perfectly cast as the honey trapped father.At times it can be intentionally cringe worthy and given the subject matter and the sexual tone it may not be for everyone, nevertheless, it's wonderfully directed by Atom Egoyan with, stylish settings and a genuine location feel.Chloe with its few twists is more intelligent and realistic than the standard Fatal Attraction (1987), Pacific Heights (1990) or a Single White Female (1993) carbon copy. It's more of an effective little character drama about values, trust and consequences to name a few rather than a straight thriller but is interesting and entertaining just the same.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Amanda Seyfried I tend to see all her movies but this one I didn't bother going to the cinema to watch purely because it wasn't showing and also I wasn't too bothered. So instead I bought it on DVD out of the blue and boy am I glad I did. Didn't really know what to expect but it was very good. Kept me hooked right to the very end and the twists the plot took were surprising and not at all expected which is what I look for in a good film.Perfect cast. Never would have pictured Julianne, Amanda and Liam all in one film but it worked; especially Julianne and Amanda as a prospective couple. Amanda was spectacular as always and was just right at playing the seductive other woman with her stunning looks. Was quite surprised that she was partially naked for a couple scenes which is very different for her (even mentioning in interviews that she wasn't majorly comfortable with it) but it does show how diverse her roles and acting abilities are. Its obviously a 15 due to the sexual content and i know many have thought it could have done without those scenes but honestly for me I think it was an important part in showing exactly how Juliannes character is doubting her sexuality and her marriage to her husband. It's not overly graphic and I think only a prude would complain about it. Brilliant cast; gripping storyline; a very good film in my opinion and highly worth a watch.</fullReview>

It wasn't horrible, as some of the reviewers here would have you believe.

		<fullReview>I was starting to dis this movie when the very end came, with the curious looks of the family, sort of eying each other from a middling distance. Then, in the final frame, showing the hairpin made it all come together for me, shedding light on the ultimate role of Chloe--giving something of herself for others, in this case, bringing the family back together. Maybe she was a Jesus figure, falling to her death, a little too symbolic/cheesy? Still, overall, it had a lovely mood, and the story tied together subtly at the end.So, I enjoyed this enough to make it well worth my time, and I'll always look forward to another Egoyan film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie raises a lot of questions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine Stewart is a gynecologist married to David Stewart, a charming university professor, for many years.She starts suspecting that her husband is having an affair, specially when she sees a picture of him with one of his young university's students, after missing the birthday party Catherine prepared for him. Determined to know the truth, she hires Chloe, a beautiful prostitute, to seduce David and see if he responds her flirts.I watched ' Chloe' two times in order to understand the movie better and to notice the subtle actions from the characters. I liked the movie( though I didn't watch the french film 'Natalie' that I see many people saying this movie is based on) and I don't dislike any of the actors casted. I also don't agree that Amanda is not playing well her role, in fact, I was surprised to see her so seductive and beautiful, since most of the movies I watched with her, she was always the stupid or dorky girl. This movie is very misunderstood, and I know it because at first, I didn't get much of the context as well. It also raises many questions, from loyalty in a marriage to getting old and less desirable. And there is Chloe, a character that many people think is bad, but I see her, as in fact, a sweet (although obsessed to Catherine) misunderstood girl, who is only searching for someone who can pay attention and to care for her.The movie is very open to interpretation and kind of intriguing( I hardly think that many people didn't stop a minute or two to think about the ending). But since I like a lot movies that talk about the oddities of human psyche, it was kind of fun to discuss the movie on the board and see what other people were thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexual psychodrama by the numbers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan has made some fine films where the mysteries of the human psyche are gradually illuminated while his stories unfold at a measured pace. Unfortunately "Chloe" has none of his habitual subtlety, and its narrative arc has the credibility of a daytime TV soap opera. Essentially a re-make of the French film "Natalie", the setting has been transferred to an overcast, wintry Toronto where a doctor, Catherine, suspects her flirtatious husband could be playing away from home. A lazy screenwriter might seize upon the idea that a suspicious wife will promptly hire a prostitute private-eye if she suspects her spouse of infidelity - so that's the course Catherine is obliged to take. Nobody should be surprised that this unwise decision leads to complications when call-girl Chloe loses her professional detachment as she pursues her investigations, and the two women become entangled in a Sapphic relationship of their own. Little reason is given for this development - or much else that follows - and the film is fatally handicapped by a wooden script that manages to be both clichéd and implausible. The major plot twist can be seen clunking down the icy street from a mile away, and until it arrives Julianne Moore's Catherine spends the duration looking brittle and neurotic, while Amanda Seyfried's Chloe lacks any kind of erotic allure with her simpering coquettish airs, and Liam Neeson's supposedly charming academic possesses the depth of a cardboard cut-out. Since none of the main characters are likable or believable, it requires considerable effort to muster more than the shrug of a shoulder when the film culminates in predictable overblown melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is more sad than sexy. A woman hires a prostitute to stalk what her husband is doing and reporting back to her after they finish up meeting. You honestly wouldn't expect Amanda Seyfield kissing every cast member on set and act as a prostitute person! You would think she's just too cute for the role but really, she killed it seriously! Her Mamma Mia days are pretty much over so she can do whatever role she has to do! I really wish her character didn't kill herself in the end because she was just awesome throughout this movie! Julianne Moore looked absolutely stunning as Catherine Stewart. In this movie, she actually reminded me of when she was involved in "Far From Heaven" with a similar story to this. Except, Liam Neeson's character wasn't gay and she didn't hire a escort to stalk the husband. Liam Neeson as usual, is always a great actor and seriously, the man never disappoints his acting skills to anyone,he's just brilliant! I have to say, this was a really good movie! I think it definitely deserves a 8/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>so unlikely and unbelievable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was something about the way this film began, husband missing flight home for admittedly 'surprise' birthday party because he is having a drink with one of his students. Something clunky and seemingly predictable about the whole proceeding and then a prostitute is hired to see if husband would seduce her. Can it get more daft? Well, it can and it does, even if some twists change things up a bit. Julianne Moore can act but I've never been a fan and here at 49 it is simply unfair to have her compared to the young (and lovely) Amanda Seyfried all the time. Liam Neeson does no more than he usual seems to to make things realistic and believable and the 'mixed up son' (director Egoyan's alter ego, I suspect) is just too young and too inexperienced for such a difficult and underwritten role. The fairly explicit and frequent sex scenes are OK but the trouble is we are almost wishing not to see them, so unlikely and unbelievable are they.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Complex On Screen Relationship I've Seen In Months</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chloe was nothing I was expecting. I'm so disappointed in the rating it currently has, must have been depleted because of dudes who were expecting a 1 1/2 hour lesbian porno. Moore and Seyfried had chemistry that lit up the screen, much more so than Neeson and Moore. As someone who doesn't like romantic movies, I was entranced by the relationship between Chloe and Catherine. A lot of reviewers are suggesting that it's soft core porn, yet I think that's only because they're the ones that watch the movie because of the lesbian scenes. The sex in the movie is actually in a relatively short scene and focuses a lot on the faces, if it were straight sex I don't think people would say it was porn. As someone who has been put in Chloe's shoes, I think the movie did the situation justice. It made Catherine into a three dimensional character who had complex feelings for Chloe. There's no happy ending, way too many movies push characters together but not 'Chloe'. Catherine and Chloe's relationship was the most real and intricate relationships i've seen in a movie. If you're watching it for lesbian action, you might be disappointed. If you are actually watching the movie to see a movie then you're going to be pleasantly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this film was pretty good. Good work from the cast, unobtrusive direction, and the setting in Toronto, rather than the tiresome Los Angeles or New York. There was a really powerful plot twist about two-thirds through. I suppose many commentators say that they saw it coming, and perhaps they did. I do not spend much time in movies trying to guess what will happen next. I just let it flow over me, and it either works, or it doesn't. This one did. Good chemistry between Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried. Maybe not so much between Moore and Neeson. Apparently this was what Neeson was filming when he suffered his well-known personal tragedy, and that could not possibly have helped the film. But overall, it is worth checking out.</fullReview>

Hiring a prostitute to pose as a student and catch him in the act, it sets in wheels the motions of untapped passions and deadly emotions.It's a bit Hitchcock lite in truth, but the strength of the cast list always keeps the story interesting. The key turns in the plot are to be taken with a pinch of salt, but Egoyan and his team keep things ethereal as the tech credits are splendidly mounted.

If you compare both versions, this remake can only lose.Amanda Seyfried is a real sweetie and I liked her even in "Lovelace" but here she is just miscast: While Emmanuelle Béart in the original version was gorgeous and really convincing as prostitute, Seyfried looks more like a lost little girl. Not one single moment you will think she is a prostitute.Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson both did a great job but had no chance against the bad script. But Moore has one fantastic moment in the scene when she confesses her husband that she feels that she lost her youth and beauty while he gets more attractive with every gray hair and thinks he doesn't like her anymore. A very sensitive and wonderful moment that lets you forget the rest of the film.Seyfrieds character Chloe is just a lost girl who is at first looking for friendship and then for love but at the end Moores character Catherine rejects her in both ways. Better watch the French original version "Nathalie" which is much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chloe is an excursion into erotic thriller territory. It's far from being a success but it's a passable film. The whole cast is solid, but it's Julianne Moore who gives it her all here. Amanda Seyfried also impresses as the beautiful but insecure young prostitute. Jason Reitman was the one who persuaded Seyfried to star in the film. Much has been said about the nudity but, while the nudity is there, the film is still surprisingly cold. The problem is that the screenplay by Erin Cressida Wilson is not very good for this material. In addition to this, director Atom Egoyan was making this film like he didn't really understand what the story is really about. It seems as though he wanted to make a good picture but he wasn't interested in the material. Moore's character Catherine Stewart is given plenty of screen time. However, more time should have been spent on developing Seyfried's character Chloe Sweeney. As a result the film lacks urgency and looks like a glossy magazine. Chloe seems like a Fatal Attraction (1987) without the thrills. A great director and good actors, including Liam Neeson, were involved but the film hardly delivers. In my opinion, it's not a must-see movie. I watched it only because it stars Amanda Seyfried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is no point to recite the events shown in this movie. The main thing - it is about love. Chloe (love) is what's missing in the life of this "happy family", is something that everybody is looking for (all the love encounters between Chloe and every member of the family), tries to retain her and fail - breaking her to glass pieces in the process.This movie brilliantly shows that modern life and seemingly perfect family is almost completely incompatible with love - or people are seeing love in many different ways - whichever they find attractive: father - having quick hand-job in the back of the flower shop, mother in the lesbian encounter or son having great sex with the hot-girl. All three of them are unable to hold-on to their corresponding version of love and return back to the loveless life.The glance that they all share in the last scene - unites them in failure to attain love whether pathetic or fabulous or hot but failure nevertheless.This movie is the great allegory, great hidden importance - real gem of the story behind the story and intellectual and sensual excellence.

		<fullReview>A small film done for television and it shows. Too many close-ups for one and the movements are so slow, including the final lethal accident, that they seem suspended in mid-air. And these moments of absolute concentration on one face with one expression that is stretched out to unbearable proportions are definitely too long.But there can be very good TV films? Sure, honey pie, sure, when David Lynch is the master of ceremonies.Now what about the subject? A university professor that makes himself academically and pedagogically available to his students. The film cheats at once and only shows girls. Of course such open relations with students can be verging onto flirting, with the girls or with the boys, or both. Students need to meet listening ears and professors need to meet mirror neurons that are going to mimic or mi-mock them. Sex is at times even the only thing they all have on their minds but they would never do it for a myriad of reasons.The wife is a gynecologist who has become frigid with her profession and she starts imagining for one thing among others that her late teenager nearly adult son is still a little boy who does not look at himself in the mirror and does not even know bees and birds have some kind of moss-life. Frigid I told you. Then she starts fantasizing her husband having an affair. So she hires a prostitute to approach her husband and test him.What had to happen happens of course and what's more the wife falls for the girl, and what's more the girl makes the boy trip and fall for her and even spend some good time in the mummy's bed, and mummy really is the right word.After a lethal accident everything will go back to normal. Three semi-strangers living under the same roof and nearly frigid to one another, estranged in all possible ways and only carrying on a life of boredom and dumb perversity. The husband will eventually assault a hotel maid and the wife will eventually have an affair with a female secretary of hers. As for the son he will probably be just as warped and twisted as his parents especially since he witnessed the lethal incident in his hastily put on briefs.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I finally decided to watch this movie I didn't really know what to expect from it.The starting situation is very simple: a married man accidentally/deliberately misses his flight and with it, his birthday too, which was thrown by his wife. The wife starts being paranoid and hires a prostitute to see if her husband is willing to cheat on her...What I really loved about the movie is the acting performance Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson did. I particularly liked Amanda's acting, the way she played that fragile, and sometimes desperate girl. I also liked the storyline because it was interesting, at some points it was surprisingly exciting and it wasn't as predictable as other movies of its genre.Although the story was quite easy to comprehend I failed to see why Cathrine thought that David was having an affair, just because he missed his flight. I mean Cathrine cried all night when David missed his flight, and she hasn't even seen Miranda's message yet, so she really had no reason to act like that... Personally, that's exactly why I couldn't feel sorry for Cathrine's character, because she had a paranoid rush and dragged everyone into all of this and it wasn't she who got hurt in the end...All in all, I think this is typically a must watch movie that holds your attention until the very end of it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've enjoyed Egoyan's films like 'Exotica' and 'Where the Truth Lies'. By comparison 'Chloe' is his weakest film. It starts off very well as Egoyan builds a tense atmosphere that is seductive but also numb. The three main characters are experiencing hollowness in their lives. David keeps himself busy at work to escape home. Catherine longs to have that relationship that she shares with her husband twenty years ago and Chloe is searching for love, even in the smallest thing.'Chloe' is a very well made film. Egoyan displays it in his traditional way with captivating visuals, dazzling cinematography, mesmerizing score and understated performance from his actors. The love scene with Seyfried and Moore is beautifully shot.Amanda Seyfried is brilliant in the title role. She depicts Chloe's vulnerability, enigma, numbness and fragility with conviction. Julianne Moore is spellbinding as the gynaecologist who suddenly finds herself seduced by Chloe. Liam Neeson, though overshadowed by both women, is adequate.While the first portion is enigmatic, mysterious, intense and mesmerizing, things go haywire when Egoyan chooses to suddenly turn 'Chloe' into a typical thriller with a typical Hollywood ending. I wish Egoyan hadn't chosen to go this standard Hollywood way. A film that had potential is ruined.as I felt that this film had potential.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chloe (2009) *** (out of 4)A successful gynecologist (Julianne Moore) begins to think that her husband (Liam Neeson) is having an affair with a much younger woman so she hires a prostitute (Amanda Seyfried) to try and seduce him. The prostitute begins a relationship with the husband so that she can give all the details to the wife who in return begins to have strange feelings towards the woman she hired as well as her husband. This isn't the first erotic movie from Egoyan who splashed on the scene years earlier with EXOTICA, another rather bizarre sex story. This film here isn't all about erotic feelings, although there's certainly a lot of sex talk. I think the most fascinating aspect of the film is Moore's character who is much older in years but seems to be lacking just about everything else. When the relationship starts out we never see the husband and hooker together. The story draws its power from the relationship that blooms between the wife and the hooker. This is so interesting because we're never really given the motives of the wife outside she wants to know if the husband is a cheater. She finds this out rather early yet she keeps sending the prostitute out to get more info. The press for the film milked the fact that Moore and Seyfried ended up in bed with a rather passionate sex scene. This sequence contains two obviously beautiful women yet the scene isn't about the sex but the drama of what their characters are feeling. I think the film never makes too much sense in what it's trying to do but perhaps that was the point. The point to keep us off guard and not sure where the thing is going to go. For the most part I enjoyed the seduction and bizarre relationship, although I must admit that I thought the final fifteen-minutes just went way too far. I'm really not sure if a film and story like this needed an ending or if any ending could have worked but the one they selected just came off way too weak. The best thing about the movie are the performances by the three leads. I've always been hit and miss on Moore as in one film I'll find her to be excellent but then the next I'd see her as lazy. There's no question this here ranks as one of her best performances because of the wide range of emotions she goes through. Her character goes through all sorts of ups and downs and I thought the actress handled them beautifully. I really enjoyed seeing how she handled this character who is pretty much going through a mid-life crisis while figuring out new things about her own sexuality. Neeson is also excellent in his role, although he's not got as flashy a role. Seyfried turns in a terrific performance as well as you have no problem believing her in the role and the level of sexual maturity she provides is certainly a highlight. I thought she and Moore did a terrific job together and you can feel everything their characters are going through. The "twist" in the story is one I caught fairly early on in the picture so if you don't pick up on this I'd say you'd enjoy the film even more. Even though CHLOE is a complete success I do think the performances make it worth sitting through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stepping into the good ol' erotic thriller genre, Egoyan did a movie that's safe and a little too predictable, but good. A specific plot twist is set up as a surprise but I think most people can see it coming early on. Moore and Seyfried are amazing here, as is Neeson in a performance which demands more mystery than anything else from him. It's a good movie, just not one that delves too deep and, being my first Egoyan, I probably was on the look-out for something a lot more something. I'll soon get to Exotica and The Sweet Hereafter. The framing of certain scenes, particularly in close-ups, reminded me of Cronenberg. Julianne Moore has amazing sexy nipples.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things Are Not What They Seem In This Sexual Shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the surface, Catherine Moore appears to be living the Canadian Dream, blessed with a beautiful face and figure, a handsome husband, a multi-talented son, a big glass paneled house and a successful career. However, the more you delve into the intimate details surrounding her personal life--the more you begin to discover that her world is falling apart--well at least from her perspective. As she approaches 50, her insecurities become more pronounced to the point where she can no longer count her blessings and begins to read negativity into her relationship with her husband and her son, feeling distanced and emotionally abandoned by them.While Catherine and her husband have been drifting apart for years, this emotional downward spiral goes into overdrive, which is triggered off by a text message which she sees on David's iPhone which reads, "Thanks for last night." Catherine suspects that David is having an affair and misinterprets his kind gestures towards women as flirting. I too would be a bit suspicious if my spouse were called to work at all hours of the day. And since when do college instructors work such long hours? Around this time she meets Chloe in the ladies room of a restaurant. After bumping into Chloe a few times, Catherine musters up the courage to ask her if she is willing to try to seduce David in order to confirm her suspicions about him being a womanizer. Chloe then agrees and is paid in cash for her services. Chloe then fills Catherine in on the juicy details. During Chloe's first meeting with David, Chloe admits that she and David were merely conversing. During the second encounter, Chloe and David kiss. By the third rendezvous Chloe tells Cathrine she admits to giving David a hand job, which would cause him to reach orgasm. Finally on her fourth interaction with David they had sexual intercourse. Instead of getting upset by these reports of their sexual escapades, Catherine becomes aroused. Sensing this, Chloe kisses Catherine. On their next meeting, Catherine and Chloe engage in sapphic sex. What started off with Catherine debriefing Chloe concerning the lurid details, ended up with them getting into each others lacy briefs. While Catherine regarded this as pleasurable, she wanted this to end right then and there. Chloe, who has ulterior motives, was falling in love with Catherine. So when Catherine refuses to see her, Chloe begins stalking her at her doctor's office as well as at her home. During this time Chloe even seduces Michael, even having sex with him, believing in a warped fashion that this would allow her to stay close to Catherine. When Catherine discovers that her son was having sex with Chloe on her bed, she shouts at Micheal, telling him to leave her room. Catherine then attempts to persuade Chloe that their affair will not work. Chloe then kisses Catherine tenderly on her lips, then falls back into one of the plate glass widows, causing it to fall through the wall frame. Chloe momentarily loses her balance, then regains it, only to let herself fall to her death, through the opening in the wall vacated by the dislodged window. During the final scene, Catherine is shown associating during a gathering of family and friends at her home. As she turns, the hairpin which she received as a gift from Chloe is in her hair.First, props should be given to Toronto native Atom Egoyan for bringing the upscale sections of this city alive with glowing sexual electricity, providing the backdrop for this erotic thriller. Next off, Liam Neeson did well as the college professor who was consumed with his career. This whole charade unraveled in the first place because David refused to celebrate his birthday at home with family and friends and instead spent the night in New York, to assist one of his female students, but not in the way that Catherine had imagined. Liam's omnipresent guilty look on his face as well as his aloofness sure gave me the feeling that he was having an affair. Amanda Seyfried did an outstanding job portraying the sophisticated call girl who delighted in exerting emotional control over her paying clients, reminiscent of Sasha Grey's mesmerizing performance in The Girlfriend Experience. She exhibited the perfect combination of beauty, innocence and intelligence, with her highly articulate on screen persona, which made me fall for all of her lies and deception, namely her confabulated sexual encounters with David. And lastly, Julianne Moore convincingly played the intelligent, but paranoid wife, who is struggling through a midlife crisis. For this film to work, we the audience must be convinced that her suspicions about David were real, not just a figment of her imagination as would later be revealed. If it wasn't for Julianne's portrayal of the psychologically twisted and emotionally distraught OB/GYN, the twists near the end of this film wouldn't have worked. And indeed they have!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My summary line is a spoiler and therefore placed at the end. Be warned.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With apologies for personal indulgence, I must start with a comment that the number one star here for me is the city of Toronto which, for once, plays ITSELF (and not proxy for some US cities), even choosing the exquisite Cfe Diplomatica as the venue of a crucial scene.The interesting thing about this unique Atom Egoyan film (ALL his films are unique) is that in its gradual evolution into a psychological thriller, it shifts its focus from one character to another, and then a third. This trio comprises David (Liam Neeson), an elite music professor exhibiting a mild penchant for flirting, Catherine (Julianne Moore) his wife, a successful gynecologist and Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) a high-class prostitute hired by Catherine to test David's fidelity. A fourth is the upper middle class couple's adolescent son that is quite typical of such an individual in such a family background. The premise is simple enough. The subtlety is in character development.That's about all I would say for the plot. The opening sequence is quite important so don't miss the start. While the film is not shot from Chloe's POV, the opening is her voice over accompanying intimate shots on how she prepares herself for a day's work, so to speak. The most interesting montage I find is one cutting back and forth between Catherine having a shower and David and Chloe having a sexual encounter at a hidden corner in the greenhouse in Allen's Garden Neeson has the least challenging role, one that he handles with ease. Moore's challenge is in balance and control, taking the audience down the path of neurotic suggestions and bringing in a check of reason just as things are about to get out of control. In the titular role, young Seyfried is challenged. Somehow, her alluring, voluptuous full lips here were hardly noticeable in "Mama Mia", which goes to show how much a director (a good one) can go in moulding a character out of an actor (a good one).Summary line: Fatal attraction with a twist</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watching this twice made me realize how excellent it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was skeptical about liking this movie. I liked Erotica, but wondered if this movie would be a bit too much like Fatal Attraction, looking at the trailer. I rented it anyway, because I like Julianne Moore's acting and also how Amanda Seyfried looks otherworldly in this, like a fairy tale character. But I feel that is what this movie is about. It's more a drama then the thriller the trailer makes it out to be. It has a mysterious quality to it and is ambiguous, letting the viewer decide what is going on in the film.It starts out straight forward enough...Julianne Moore's character Catherine thinks her husband is cheating on her so she hires Chloe, played by Amanda Seyfried, to set up a scene where she meets the husband and sees if the husband makes a pass at her. As things progress, an erotic element is added as Catherine lives out her erotic side lost to her husband through Chloe's stories of her sexual interaction with Catherine's husband. Then Chloe begins to fall for Catherine, while Catherine, being controlling, was only in it to pay a prostitute in a way that she could retrieve her lost sexuality. At first, I was sort of angry with the ending. Because I always feel that in films with lesbian scenes in them, that one of the people involved dies, like it is a metaphor that sexuality outside the normal family life Catherine has is wrong and therefore Chloe is a predator of the family...OK, it's all Fatal Attraction...I won't be ignored! But watching it a second time on DVD with the commentary and also watching the deleted scenes which I think add to understanding the stressful relationship between Catherine and her son, made me realize how much of this movie could be in Catherine's head. Like Chloe might not exist or exist as metaphor or fantasy. At the same time, she could be real. There is also the point of who is lying and telling the truth in this film. Is Chloe really having erotic adventures with Catherine's husband or is she making it up? Is she really a prostitute? She does have a quote in the beginning about being whomever a person wants her to be...but she never says she's a prostitute and she does take money from Catherine, but maybe she wants Catherine to think she is one. It's never 100% clear. To me, Catherine's husband could be having an affair with his student and Chloe too and could hide it well. I got that from the café scene where Catherine is with her husband and Chloe shows up, that maybe Catherine's husband has messed around with students and Chloe and can hide it well. Or he could be telling the truth, that he only flirts with students and has been 100% faithful to Catherine. Up to the interpretation of the viewer.On the outside, it does look like the typical erotic thriller, with poor Chloe meeting her end Glenn Close style. In a nice way, reflective of foreign films, Chloe chooses to die, no one is killing her. She only wishes for Catherine to save her in the end because Chloe loves her, but Catherine doesn't come through. In a way, Chloe has to die. She is mystery. She is metaphor. She becomes whatever the person who pays her wants her to be. But she also has her true feelings, a girl with a mommy complex instead of a daddy complex, who finds her maternal lover in Catherine to replace the mom who left her. Catherine, at that point, wants Chloe out of her life, so she has no choice but to "vanish". It also adds to the point that Chloe could be in Catherine's head since she isn't there to interact with the son, the husband and Catherine, since in this world, Chloe has been with all of them.I highly recommend this film. Especially if you like the director's other movies like Erotica. It makes me want to seek out other films he has done and also the French version of this film which apparently has less mystery. The sensuality in this film is top notch too. I was very amazed by the imagery and how this film was shot. It's very lovely and sensual without being cheesy or stereotyped. It's in its own little world.</fullReview>

My mom facing right now the middle-age crisis\menopause. I Can see the suspicion she have, i can see the lack of confidence she have, like we can see in the movie.The acting was average and its a shame to call this movie "Thriller", but i never got bored and its very rare. I Saw yesterday "The Silance Of The Lambs" and "Swing Vote", i guess both more appreciated movies and i enjoyed this one more.I Think the "IMDB Rating" should be higher.

		<fullReview>I had heard some good word of mouth about this movie from other people so i watched Chloe and after Amanda Seyfried mini speech at the start of the movie i figured out right there where this movie was headed. This movie falls in the milieu of Jagged Edge, A Woman Scorned and many others with a psychotic stalker. Julianne Moore plays a doctor married to Liam Neeson's professor character who suspects that he is being unfaithful also is a strained relationship with her son for reasons never ever fully explained. She hires Chloe, a prostitute, to try and seduce her husband. Chloe tells her of the affair and the doctor gets more and more distressed this goes on and on and on for about an hour until the twist showing that it was all made up which in her speech at the first Chloe admitted to being anything you want her to be foreshadowing the movie. Their is the Julianne prerequisite nude scenes along with glimpses of Amanda too but while watching this i kept thinking of all the other movies that i have seen this before and this was just recycling old clichés over and over . The acting is functional and the experience was dull i would not recommend this at all unless you like your soft porn and the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"How do I get through to you? This business transaction, which is what this was, is over."Chloe is the story of a woman named Catherine (Julianne Moore) who suspects her husband (Liam Neeson) of being unfaithful. She hires a high-class prostitute that she happens across named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), to test her husband's fidelity. Of course, events end up happening in a way that no one expected and Catherine's life takes a turn down a path that she didn't anticipate, as a result of Chloe's involvement.A guess a good description of this movie would be a sexual thriller. There's a lot of sex and a lot of skin, but it's in support of a story, instead of the story being there as an excuse to show off Seyfried's goods. I actually thought the plot started off in a promising direction, but a few twists and turns in the second half of the movie do more harm than good. As a result, the ending is a little muddled and underwhelming. Not enough to ruin the movie, but it did lower my score a bit.I give Chloe a lot of credit for being somewhat different from the other movies I've seen lately, but it wasn't as good as it could have been. &nbsp;&nbsp;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was quite excited to watch the film Chloe after I'd seen Atom Egoyan talk about the film in an interview. Since it hadn't yet been released in The Netherlands, I went back and watched the original French film it was based on, Nathalie.I was disappointed about the way Chloe measured up. The French film did a great job of unfolding the story and the relationship between the two leading women with subtlety, and the plot progressed at a steady pace.While Egoyan's version had more dramatic flair and certainly a more heightened climax, I think the film fails in its character development. In the French version, we really got a better understanding of Chloe (Natalie), which I think was essential to bringing the film to a sound conclusion.As far as the acting performances, Gerard Depardieu easily outshone Liam Neeson by far as the wayward but loving husband. Julianne Moore's performance in this film seemed frenetic at best, almost as if she was over-acting. As for the son, in my opinion, his character was just plain annoying.Overall, I found this film to be yet another popcorn drama about dysfunctional marriages with a slow plot, little character development and a cop-out ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"CHLOE" works despite the obvious flaws and comes out an engaging potboiler.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen many films just like or similar to Atom Egoyan's "CHLOE" I can name a few right off the top of my head: "Fatal Attraction"(1987), "9 1/2 Weeks"(1986), "Indecent Proposal"(1993), "Lolita(1997), "Disclosure"(1994). In addition, one of the most infamous of the erotic thriller genre "Basic Instinct"(1992), now I ask you what all these films have in common. Simple they all have alluring femme fatale characters that try to seduce and kill and assert there power over men how theses beautiful and dangerous women and easily manipulate and control the men that are either after them or desire them. Theses type of films can go one of two ways 1. down the road of complete and utter absurdity and rampant sexuality(Basic Instinct, Lolita) that don't have a shred of intelligence and only serve the purpose of giving audiences some good sex scenes and nothing much else. On the other hand, the film can balance brains and sex to coherently tell an intelligent story of love, desire and family social angst (Fatal Attraction, Unfaithful, Eyes wide Shut) to make the film more than about sex. It's more about the complications of begin unfaithful or how sometimes the desire or simple thought of begin with someone else or wanting someone can destroy your life. Atom Egoyan's tempting and beautifully photographed story of how one woman's (Julianne Moore) suspicion takes her to a very dark place that will change her life forever.Atom Egoyan's potboiler of a drama "CHLOE" succeeds despite the morbid pace of this film how it succeeds all depends on the actors and their performances. If there, performances are flat, the film is flat and while the performances in this film are not Oscar worthy, they certainly are better than the usual that come out of this genre. It's an above average erotic thriller seeing as it is more of a drama than an erotic thriller and that is what makes this film an actually film instead of an 1hr. 36 min sex scene which to me is nothing to sneeze at. What I liked about this film was the character they were all grayed instead of black and white. You knew there motives you know what has happened but you do not know exactly if it's true and there is where the films main strength lies and also one of the main points of the plot and story. You can derive a conclusion but then in the end, when the big reveal, you realize you only got fish. "CHLOE" may not be perfect and it certainly has its moments where it falters in the end this film won't let you down even it may seem that it does.I am not lying to you when I say that this film is complete and utter guilty pleasure entertainment with some very handsomely written dialogue and amazing cinematography that pull this film all together and with keen direction from Atom Egoyan "CHLOE" does not fail.Julianne Moore has done so much better than "Chloe" but I will give her the benefit of the doubt and say this in her favor Moore wasn't bad, she wasn't great but she wasn't bad and that for what it is something spectacular. Moore has had a good role in a while and in "CHLOE" she shows that she can return back to the days when she laid on the powerful performances that were Oscar worthy. Certainly her performance in "CHLOE" is nowhere near being worthy of an award but for what it is good enough for me to say that she did a fine job. Liam Neeson never really fails you but lately he has been releasing a string of films that are less than good his performance is almost unnecessary he doesn't fit the part at all he is just droning along at an uneven pace, Neeson just comes off as an eyesore in this picture with his distant performance. The best performance in the entire film comes from someone you would count out as being good, Amanda Seyfried, she gives such an unsettling and haunted performance that this film could survive solely on her if it wanted to. But sadly even though the film is called "CHLOE" she is playing second fiddle to Neeson and Moore being there just as something to look good when in reality she could have been so much more instead of being just the face of the film and nothing more, Seyfried is massively overlooked but amazingly still shines."CHLOE" may not impress many and others may overlook this film due to its premise and dismiss it as something they have seen before and while yes this has been done once or maybe twice or hell maybe ten times before. The only thing that keeps "CHLOE" fresh and stylish is the great script, keen direction and solid performances from the main cast. Without those things, "CHLOE" would sink under its own premise but it is good enough on it's own to be called flawed but worthy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this film tonight for no other reason than I ran out of other things to go see where I live. It was a very pleasant surprise but it left me with unresolved thoughts; unresolved thoughts concerning the acting abilities of Amanda Seyfried as the title character. Wow.The premise for this film is a bit on the offbeat side, but I like offbeat if it's done well., and this one is certainly done well. The Julianne Moore character hires Seyfried to check out if her husband has a wandering eye; played by the ever talented Liam Neeson. The story that unfolds is just this side of bizarre, but it works. I even liked the different location - in this case Toronto. Watching the cold wet weather makes me want to move there.The film builds, as some do, on human frailty, fear, miscommunication and misunderstanding, sprinkled with a liberal dose of leaping to conclusions and making rash assumptions. That little voice inside me was whispering to me, "Why can people not be more honest and forthcoming in their dealings with loved ones.". Nothing in human relations could be more important but is more neglected.The most surprising thing, as I mentioned before, is the terrific talent of Amanda Seyfried. I just saw her recently in "Letters to Juliette", in which she was excellent and not too long ago in "Dear John". I found myself thinking about her performances in those films and also in the not too distant "Mama Mia". I couldn't help but marvel at the unmistakable talent she displays here so easily and so frequently.By the end of the film the thought that flashed through my head was, "She's the actress Marilyn Monroe wishes she was"; which is to say, this girl can really act. On top of that, she has a face and figure a few million other girls would kill for and she casually shows that amazing physique a number of times throughout the film. In spite of that, I'd rather see her acting performance. She is really something and I'm glad to see she's getting more notice and more work. I can't wait to see much more of her in years to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked Egoyan's The Sweet Hereafter a lot - but I saw it back when my life allowed for more immersion in poetic, dreamlike intervals. And it dealt with communal/family dynamics, along with loss &amp; tragedy - so, in a way, it had an easier path to intense engagement. 'Chloe' is one of several films I've recently seen that have all centered on the loss of power/attractiveness that can happen to women over a certain age - this film would be nothing without that as an integral, albeit unspoken theme. So my first problem is being very tired of this theme, or of nothing new/interesting being done with it.The second big problem is the film's pacing... so slow, I was tempted to fast forward a few times to see if the 'thriller' part would ever begin. Which brings me to Problem No. 3...Amanda Seyfried - had her part gone to someone who doesn't look like a fish (to me, Seyfried does, although I'm clearly in the minority on this), Chloe's (the character's) actions, along with her accounts of erotic/sexual encounters, might have been more exciting/evocative. But I find it so difficult to imagine that anyone would want to engage in relations with her that... well, there you have it. I'm writing this review in case there's anyone else who's on the fence re: watching, per Seyfried's presence, or who did watch &amp; is searching for another voice that they can relate to. Moore's amazing (although, as someone said, she hardly looks ready to be 'put out to pasture'); Neeson's fine. The son's character is surprisingly boring &amp; unattractive. Sorry!</fullReview>

It's a perfect life on the surface but Catherine begins to suspect David cheating on her. She hires call girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to test his fidelity. Chloe reports her encounters back to Catherine. Chloe is complicated and has a sexual tryst with Catherine.The three lead actors have amazing pedigrees. Atom Egoyan has directed sexually ambitious movies before but this one has no heat. I do like the performances but Egoyan has instilled a coldness throughout the film. It keeps the sexual tension down when it should be boiling over. Although it could be argued that Egoyan wanted a chilling effect for this overheated premise. I don't buy it but I do still love the actors and it's beautifully shot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chloe (2010) which later becomes more clear of its film caliber as everything starts to unfold. Twenty years Chloe's senior, what Catherine (Julianne Moore) fears most is the encroaching invisibility the younger woman seems to crave. A high-end gynecologist (if you'll excuse the term, and the fact that we don't actually have those in Canada), Catherine has an office on Toronto's snooty Yorkville strip and a cubist home in its poshest neighborhood. She's beautiful, married to Liam Neeson (playing a professor named David), and has a sexually active teenage son named Michael (Max Thierot). She's also terrible at her job: what kind of gynecologist would brush off a mortified woman's searching confession (in stirrups, no less) to never having had an orgasm with the equivalent. Everything appears to come in place in its finale but the ending feels as if we were put down and the writers apparently thought it was the best way to end the film. Once again, a fairy tale ending may appear- depending on your viewpoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A character piece; Polanski's Carnage meets Fatal Attraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We all have those actors we never really manage to click with, whom most likely have some kind of obvious promise and talent but just don't sit well with us and mine has always been Seyfried. I just don't like her, I think she's overrated. Chloe however is underrated as I hadn't ever heard the name of the film before, even though the actors involved such as Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are household names. It wouldn't appeal to everyone, the film isn't funny, scary, thrilling or anything as such but its an intricate character piece and is more or less fascinating to experience. Think Fatal Attraction meets Roman Polanski's Carnage. There's a heavy amount of character development throughout which always prompts perspective of a benevolent director, he knows what the audience wants and promises something we only receive ten minutes before the end. Unfortunately for Egoyan's audience, it's slightly anti- climactic and we're left with plenty of unanswered questions. The acting is fantastic, really. Even from Amanda Seyfried who I've already mentioned as usually managing to turn me off from a film, but even her I found to be effortless and cool in the delivery of the title character. The chemistry between Moore, Neeson and Seyfried is taut, real and memorably erotic. Unfortunately overall, I wouldn't clamber to watch it again but I did find it enjoyable and stimulating for the duration. Recommended. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intriguing disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An ageing wife hires a babe to prove her husband is a cheater, but the babe has eyes for her.Simplistic drama that avoids every interesting development, and all the possibilities that kept me guessing evaporated well before the end. It is stylish and well made, with a good cast. The actress playing the babe is outstanding - one look-to-camera with her green eyes filling the screen - but she's not the thing, and the roles for the more experienced actors feel misguided.Not sure where this goes wrong. The director did something similar in Where The Truth Lies - promising lots, but ending up with little. The writer gives some clunky scenes that make the story struggle, and doesn't let the actors tell a satisfying story.The score is excellent, loved every second of it, and the pace is good.Overall, made-for-TV feel after an intriguing build-up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start I was comparing this film to "Nathalie", the original French version of this film. They're pretty much the same besides the few twists that occur in this film. Like the original Catherine (Julianne Moore) hires a prostitute, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), to seduce her husband, David (Liam Neeson), whom she thinks is cheating on her. I wasn't surprised at anything that happened in this film being that I saw the original French version but I thought it was still pretty good and it still kept me interested. One extremely good thing about this film was the cast. Being that Liam Neeson is one of my favorite actors and I enjoy seeing Julianne Moore's work I couldn't pass this film up. both of them were momentous. This film was a little different from the others I've seen Amanda Seyfried in but she was well fitted for the part. This film, like it's French original, is pretty decent. Rather you see one or the other or both it really doesn't matter. Like I said earlier they're pretty much what and what.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Hollywood's dullest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hated CHLOE with a vengeance. The plot of the film sounds good, a little like the Richard Gere vehicle UNFAITHFUL: Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson are playing an unhappily married husband and wife; Moore employs the beautiful student Amanda Seyfried to seduce her husband, with unforeseen consequences for all three involved.Now, I know there were difficulties with this production. Neeson's real-life wife died halfway through shooting, thus curtailing his presence in the film, which required rewrites. Even so, this doesn't excuse almost the entire production consisting of Moore and Seyfried just jawing together, which makes for exceptionally boring viewing.I've always found Moore one of the most depressing and 'samey' actresses out there, even though the Oscar guys love her. This was another role where I hated her character with her stupid histrionics and selfish, 'me me me' attitude. Seyfried is better, but given too little to do, while Neeson barely registers. I sniggered at the scriptwriter's attempts at shockingly explicit dialogue, and I snoozed through 90% of the running time where absolutely nothing happens.</fullReview>

I don't know if it's them or the characters or if it's Julianne and Amanda themselves, but I love this movie. Chloe is remake of the French film ''Nathlie'', which I know nothing about, other than the fact that I'm pointing out to you in this sentence. Redhair vixen Julianne Moore is so fire. Amanda Seyfried is even hotter. God, Amanda Seyfried, what are you doing? You're so smart and so sexy. Amanda Seyfried makes this movie so amazing, and Julianne Moore specially gives an outstanding performance, really emotionally compelling. Let's move on. I love Julianne Moore. Liam Neissen is well dressed in his role, and quite good, very emotionally compelling. Amanda Seyfried is the superstar of Chloe, and I want to see more. I want to see more of her naked, I want to see more of her smile, and I want to see more of her in more and more movies, no pun intended. I love Amanda Seyfried! Chloe is really good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As much a psychological thriller as an erotic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chloe" has certain similarities with "The Other Man", a film from the previous year which also starred Liam Neeson. In the earlier film Neeson played a man who believes that his wife is having an affair. Here, he plays a man whose wife believes he is having an affair. In "The Other Man", a curious relationship grew up between Neeson's character Peter and the man whom he believed to be his wife's lover. In "Chloe" a curious relationship grows up between the wife of Neeson's character and the woman whom she believes to be her husband's mistress. Like "The Other Man", "Chloe" revolves around a middle-aged middle-class couple, but is set in Canada rather than Britain. (It was shot in Toronto). David Stewart is a college professor, his wife Catherine a gynaecologist. The physical side of their relationship has diminished in recent years and Catherine suspects David of being unfaithful to her. In order to test David's loyalty to her she persuades Chloe, a young and beautiful call girl whom she has met a in bar, to try and seduce him. There then follows a series of meetings in which Chloe describes her encounters with David in explicit detail. In fact, Chloe has never even met David and these accounts are all fantasy, but Catherine is taken in. Strangely enough, however, rather than becoming jealous Catherine finds herself becoming aroused by the thought of her husband and Chloe together, while Chloe herself is equally aroused by recounting her fantasies to Catherine. The development of these sexual feelings eventually leads to a lesbian relationship between the two women.A film with a plot like this could easily have become little more than soft-core porn, especially as its central premise is perhaps not a particularly plausible one. Many women may suspect their husbands of infidelity, but few of them would think of hiring a prostitute to entrap him, and fewer still would go on to have lesbian sex with her. That it does not is very much to the credit of the director Atom Egoyan and of his two leading ladies, Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried. Moore has some very dubious entries on her CV, such as the dreadful "Body of Evidence" and that misbegotten remake of "Psycho", but she has also been responsible for some very good performances, mostly in films like "The Hours" and "Far from Heaven" where she is called upon to explore the more emotional side of human existence. "Chloe" is another to add to this list. (Oddly enough all three of these films deal with the subject of homosexuality, either male or female or, in the case of "The Hours", both). As for Seyfried, her performance was a revelation. When I first saw her in another misbegotten film, "Mamma Mia!", I was impressed by her singing voice but not by her acting. She was better in "Red Riding Hood" and "Les Miserables", but her performance in "Chloe" is certainly the best I have yet seem from her. At the end of the film Chloe becomes that familiar figure from modern-day thrillers, the emotionally out-of- control female threatening the peace and wellbeing of an entire family, the spiritual descendant of Glenn Close in "Fatal Attraction" or Rebecca de Mornay in "The Hand that Rocks the Cradle". Seyfried, however, never lets us forget that Chloe is a real human being with emotions of her own, not just a cardboard thriller villainess. In her earlier scenes she combines well with Moore, and the two actresses display a control and sensitivity which, despite a potentially titillating theme, saves the film from becoming mere exploitation. Another similarity between this film and "The Other Man" is that both Egoyan and Richard Eyre, the director of the earlier film, both use a restricted palette, dominated by browns, oranges and greys. In "Chloe" the outdoor scenes (the action takes place in winter) are certainly bleak and sombre, but the interior ones, especially those set in Catherine and David's ultra-modern home are often surprisingly warm in tone, showing that brown can sometimes be a warm colour as well as a dull one. The symbolism is possibly that of the warmth and security of the family being threatened by a force from the outside world. The Rotten Tomatoes website opines about the film that "Despite its promising pedigree and a titillating premise, "Chloe" ultimately fails to deliver the heat- or the thrills- expected of a sexual thriller." With all due respect to the author of that quotation, he or she appears to be accusing Egoyan of trying, and failing, to do something which he never set out to accomplish. He was not simply aiming at a thriller on a sexual theme- if you want something like that, try "Body of Evidence"- but was trying something more ambitious, namely to make a serious film about human relationships. (He has the reputation of being an auteur who specialises in films of this nature). Despite the relatively brief sex scenes, this is as much a psychological thriller as an erotic thriller. More than that, it is a pretty good psychological thriller. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chloe has potential and the story is intrinsically captivating. However, the movie lacked in some fundamental components that determine whether a movie is just plain good - or if it's better than that. I'm always judging quite harshly when there isn't enough character depth, and that is the main issue with Chloe. I didn't feel as if I was let in enough to learn the motives and the reasoning that drove the characters to do x or y. But the movie is definitely something and I strongly recommend it. The chemistry between the actors, the lines and the story itself is all very well done. And the photo in the film is also beautiful. I predicted the ending though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Erotic thriller that is a little confusing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm still undecided about how I really feel about this movie. For the most part I really am not too crazy about it. "Chloe" is definitely a different type of movie. "Chloe" is about Catherine, a woman who is convinced that her husband is cheating on her, so she hires a prostitute to seduce her husband to find out if he really is an unfaithful man.I won't go into detail about everything that happens in the movie. This movie definitely has quite a few twists to it. However I did have a suspicion that Chloe was lying to Catherine. The movie in some ways was a bit confusing, for example I'm not sure if David really did have an affair with Miranda(the student in the beginning). I know David says he has never cheated on Catherine but it's hard to believe he didn't sleep with Miranda. I mean he calls Catherine to tell her he just missed his plane and that he'll be late but then in the background you clearly see Miranda walking towards David. Then of course there is the message Catherine found on David's phone that shows a picture of Miranda with David saying "thanks for a great night"(or something like that). Also, David is such a flirt towards women, I highly doubt he has never strayed. Another thing that confused me is why did Chloe lie to Catherine about fooling around with David, and why did she lie about sleeping with David?? That was kind of a mystery to me. The ending was also quite confusing to me as well. I still haven't quite figured it out yet.I give this movie a 5 out of 10. I just didn't care for it too much. I was thinking this movie was going to be better than it was since Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson were in it, and they are both good actors and are usually in good movies. I was pretty disappointed though. I most likely won't watch this movie again and I know I won't be buying it but this movie helped me kill 96 minutes on a boring day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chloe is a solid erotic/romantic thriller, that keeps the viewer interested and invested throughout, even if it's pretty predictable - the big twist at the very end can be figured out around the middle of the film. Still - as can be expected from Atom Egoyan, the film has strong atmosphere, excellent cinematography, superb acting (Liam Neeson and Julianne Moore are both terrific) and a semi-open ending that leaves room for speculation and interpretation.Having said all that, it's a weak film by Egoyan's standard. It's the first time he directed a film with somebody else's script, and it shows. The characters aren't as complex and fleshed-out as Egoyan's usually are; more importantly, the relationships between them (which were the strongest focal point of The Sweet Hereafter and Exotica) lack conviction. Like Egoyan's other films, it deals with sexuality, intimacy and detachment, but in a more superficial way. Chloe feels like a remake of a French erotic thriller - which is what it is - more than an Egoyan film. It's enjoyable, entertaining and gripping, but not as deep as his other works.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining enough, but in some ways something of a cop-out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was rather taken with Atom Egoyan's Chloe until I read that it is a remake of a French film called Nathalie, which was released as recently as 2003. And that rather took the sheen off it for me. The premise is interesting, though a tad far-fetched - wife believes her husband is cheating on her and hires a high-class call-girl to tempt him into further indiscretion so that she has solid evidence - and it does all sound rather French and 'sophisticated', but Egoyan's execution keeps up the suspense. Yet why bother with a remake? Doesn't the man have enough ideas of his own? I haven't seen Nathalie so I don't know whether or not Egoyan adds anything. My guess is that he doesn't.Chloe (and, I suppose, Nathalie, although as I haven't seen it, I can't comment) is one of those films whose impact tends to evaporate within minutes of the final moments. You could argue that, essentially, a film is not obliged to go anything else but entertain for the duration, and Chloe most certainly does that. But the films we remember and chose to watch again are those whose impact does linger and which, occasionally, gives us an insight we didn't before have. On that score Chloe must settle for a round nul points. I would argue that in view of what we are presented with for three-quarters of the film - professional woman discovers to her surprise that she rather likes swinging both ways and might well have engineered the whole 'my husband is cheating on me' scenario to allow herself an hour or two of sapphic pleasure - we are entitled to an insight or two. But we don't get them. Chloe ends - after an unforeseen and somewhat contrived shock - on a rather bathetic note and does so all too suddenly. Given Egoyan's reputation as something of a highbrow director dude, that means Chloe is a miss. And given that it is a remake, it must rank as a double miss. But don't necessarily let that put you off.Chloe rattles along quite nicely in its own way and watching two attractive women making out doesn't distress you (and it didn't distress me) and if you are content with one or two other scenes of soft porn, Chloe fits the bill. But chalk it up as an entertaining night in with a bottle of wine rather than anything brighter. And remember that it is a remake. I rather suspect the original Nathalie, given the very French nature of the story, was rather better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A total waste of talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good old Hollywood. They've taken the dull and mildly offensive French film "Nathalie" and turned it into something even more conservative and misogynistic.In "Nathalie" the usually regal "Fanny Ardant" is transformed from a tedious hausfrau into her husband's ideal partner by virtue of a little extra marital sex. In this ridiculously plotted film Hollywood decides to reinforce good old family values by turning the prostitute character, in this case "Chloe" played by Amanda Seyfried, from a conduit to the housewife's sexual awakening into a full blown "Fatal Attraction " type threat to the family unit. As a result, Glenn Close like, the poor girl has to die at the end to allow the happy couple to conclude with a loving embrace. And what sort of a family unit is this? A secretive husband who has no ability to communicate with his wife, a son who is so disrespectful to his mother that he doesn't even answer her and a wife - in this case transformed from housewife to a gynaecologist. This change adds no extra plot depth or subtext but is simply added because obviously nobody in Hollywood films can be unemployed or blue collar and the family needs a high income to be able to afford that stupid house they live in, the one with the windows that push though if you lean on them!Atom Egoyan must have had a few bills land on his doormat the day he accepted to take on this film. The creator of such gems as "The Sweet Hereafter" and "The Adjuster" his direction on this film is flat and uninteresting. The often wonderful Julianne Moore reverts to hysterical middle class lady and furrowed brow auto pilot mode. Whereas I suspect she may have thought this film was about female sexuality and empowerment it becomes about the nuclear family fighting off the threat to traditional conservative values. Poor old Liam Neeson does his usual Steven Segal impersonation and the unflattering lighting only serves to highlight his dyed hair, which has the texture of a nylon carpet, the pancake make-up and the eye liner. My smart wife described him as more of a lethargio than a Lothario in his performance in this film. When I see Liam I am always reminded of the line in "Tootsie" where Dustin Hoffman talks about his one man show where he performed as vegetables whereas Liam could put on a show performing as household wooden furniture, his oak table would be breathtaking!Amanda Seyfried gives a very committed performance, obviously seeing this as part of her move to more edgy material such as "Lovelace" and "Jennifer's Body". But in reality none of the family films that she has previously appeared in have ended up being as reactionary as this stinker ultimately proves to be.The fact that the adaptations to the script are written by a woman , Erin Cressida Wilson, show that class awareness is ultimately more important than gender when it comes to being able to see the truth in the world. Her work on this film has made me re-visit my views on "Secretary", which she also wrote, and I now wonder whether what I thought was a satire is in fact tired old male fantasy fulfillment. Ms Wilson is clearly a LA girl who escaped a life regurgitating cliché amongst American academia to actually become a screen writer, just so long as she played the tiresome Hollywood game. So a total waste of talent and time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ingenious Plot Twist ***SPOILER ALERT**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am a huge fan of Amanda Seyfried. She's beautiful, exceptionally talented, and this role demonstrates her ability to perform in all genres and to do so flawlessly. Quite frankly, I was in total shock to see the tables turned on a theme: to watch women in traditional male roles (the males as transgressors vs. the passive wife/victim). I would have preferred to see others cast in the roles of the Stewarts (keeping the son, however-I thought he was adorable and charming). Was I the only person to notice the billboard in view of Dr. Stewart's office window? It appeared to be her, in full view of anyone on the street. Since that seemed to be Chloe's "turf", she could have easily set her sights on Dr. Stewart. Chloe possessed the intellectual resources to stalk her prey and catch her. I doubt she was bisexual. I believe she was a lesbian, but men were simply a part of her job. Chloe's obsession with Dr. Stewart seemed to have deep roots associated with her mother. Her dialog in the beginning tells the entire story: she has to know her craft. It is necessary to know what to say, how to touch, etc. In short, to find each person's magic button and when to push it. I thought it was brilliant!</fullReview>

Seyfried shows limited acting skills but puts her other endowments on display.

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Hot and erotic drama set in Toronto Canada in the dead of winter that really heats things up with teenage call-girl Chloe, Amanda Seyfried, getting involved with both David and Catherine Stewart, Liam Neeson &amp; Julianne Moore, in an misguided effort by Catherine to find out if her hunk of a man hubby David is cheating on her.It's when David didn't show up,he claimed he missed his flight in New York City, at a surprise birthday party that Catherine is throwing for him that she starts to get suspicions about him making out with the many sexy female students he's teaching, as a professor of the arts, in collage. You can't blame Catherine in feeling that David is playing the field in that the girls in his classes are just plain nuts about him. And on top of all that David is anything but passive in letting them throw themselves on him. In her trying to find out if David is taking his action outside the Stewart bedroom Catherine hires sexy call-girl Chole to make a play for him to see if he takes the bait.At first David is reported by Chloe to be faithful to his marriage vows but as she starts to turn the screws on him, at David's wife Catherine's insistence, he falls apart like a house of cards and gives in to her very sexy advances! Just hearing about the hot and heavy action that both David and Chloe are engaged in from Chloe herself gets Catherine so hot and worked up that she ends up in bed with her in what has to be about as close a film can get, in a lesbian one on one sexual encounter, without receiving a triple X rating!Catherine's action in trying to get the goods on David soon has him suspect,in her always being out late at night, that she's having an affair behind his back and finally lets his feeling become known to her in a wild exchange in the family kitchen. Thinking that she's the one who's been cheated on Catherine agrees to confront David at the downtown Tronto's Cafe Diplamatico and spill the goods on him with Chloe, who has no idea what Catherine is planning, as the surprise guest! This air tight plan on Catherine's part, to prove her husbands infidelity, turned out to be a total and complete disaster that leaves the once confident Catherine in a state of complete shock!***SPOILERS*** Very well made and interesting adult movie that has some of the most both explicit sexual talk as well as action you'l find in a non X rated motion picture. Chloe was the person really pulling the strings in the film manipulation both David and Catherine as well as the couples very sexually active 17 years old son the piano playing Michael, Max Thieriot, whom after her act was exposed tried to destroy his, like she did his parents, life as well! In the end Chloe realized what a mess she made of everything and everyone in the movie then just lets herself go to her enviable demise as a both shocked Catherine and Michael, whom she was just caught in bed with, watched helplessly!Great acting by everyone involved with a knock out scene at the café Diplamatico when the big showdown between Catherine David &amp; Chloe was to take place. Liam Neeson's, as David Stewart, incredible acting ability for him to keep a straight face when he's approached from behind by Chole, who has no idea that he was there, was so down right convincing and on the money that it had both Catherine, who planned the whole event, and Chloe at a loss for words almost throughout the remainder of the film! That jaw-dropping scene alone is worth the price of admission and has to rank right up there with the famous "I Coulda been a Contender" scene between Marlon Brando and Rod Steiger in the movie "On the Waterfront"!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's the characters that make this intriguing....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having just watched this, I have to say Chloe is more a film about the need for intimacy and the need to feel good. This is what I picked up from it the most.Overall, the film is a solid thriller that goes into the path of a beautiful young woman called Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) who works as a young prostitute. We learn from the very beginning that she has to know exactly what to say, how to touch, how to think in order to make her clients want her....and after she can disappear. Julianna Moore plays Katherine who is a successful gynaecologist who suspects that her husband David (Liam Neeson) is having an affair. So she hires young Chloe to play tricks on him in order to test his faithfulness to her.Amanda Seyfried I thought was terrific as this young innocent girl who seems to want more than just what she does in her job. She eventually becomes attached to Katherine after feeling an emotional bond with her, which eventually leads to passion, and this is where the problems start.Julianne Moore is superb as always. She can handle drama in her sleep, and Liam Neeson is respectable in his role too. It seems all the characters in this film are longing for that sense of intimacy, not just for sex, but to feel loved and wanted. This is even depicted in Katherine's son Michael, who seems to take a girl home just for the sake of not being lonely at home, with two seemingly distant parents.The third act sort of falls flat when it turns into more of a typical fatal attraction type scenario. I felt they could have developed more of the relationship between Katherine and Chloe, and maybe explore more in regards to Chloe's past perhaps and a possibility of starting afresh. But then this would be more of a melodrama than a thriller wouldn't it? So you can't blame them for taking the formula.The ending is a bit hard to swallow in regards to the motivations of the characters. It was done a bit too fast for me with not enough time for it to sink in. The relationship with Katherine and her son was not resolved in the end that explained anything, thus I felt a bit let down by it.It is the performances that make this worth the viewing. With top actors, and Amanda Seyfried proving she can handle more than people may think she can, I still stuck to this from start to finish. Seyfried can convey a lot of emotions and is perfect for this role. She eludes both a beauty and internal fiery danger into her character terrifically. It is well worth your time, but don't go expecting something absolutely spellbinding....it's just worth the ride while you are there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For me it was like watching two films simultaneously: the former being the actual thriller that viewer was meant to see and the latter an actual artistic tribute to the saga of letting go of one's youth and embracing maturity.The movie symbolically opens to Julianne Moore's character looking out a window, spying on a much younger woman as she goes about her daily life and then a few scenes latter her husband (played by Liam Neeson) is shown giving a lecture(his character is a professor) to his adoring students who actually treat him like he's a rock star. This sort of sets the tone for everything else that takes place in the rest of the movie. Moore's character's fears of ageism and inadequacy versus Neeson's character's fear that one more birthday might snap his boyish charm, his way with the ladies and natural wit right out of him. There was a point in the film where Moore's character said to her husband that in spite of his fears of growing old, no matter what he did, he always became more attractive to her. Which is pretty much the way the world works in real life. The older men get the more attractive they seem yet the older women get the closer they are to being moved to the back burner.Amanda Seyfried held her own opposite such seasoned powerhouse performers like Neeson and Moore, the guy who played their son needs acting lessons but otherwise, it was an excellent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Atom Egoyan Classic: erotic and suspenseful, intensely emotional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine (Juliane Moore) suspects her husband David (Liam Neeson) is cheating on her so she hires a prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to test her suspicion. She pays her to seduce her husband. If her husband is seduced, her suspicions would be justified. I think the movie successfully shows the conflict between deepest, subconscious desires and the limitation of social roles bound by moral conventions. There is always a chance the people may be taken hostage by their desires and no relationship (even a simple business transaction) is easily dismissed. The movie raises the questions about marriage, loyalty, family and erotic desires. What should married couples do when they lose passion for each other, the marriage becomes boring and they are tempted by outside temptations? Should they follow their desires or stay loyal to their social roles? I thought the story was very interesting and characters were well-developed and realistic. Story portrays complex interactions among many characters, husband and wife, husband with other women, wife's relation with the prostitute and the couple's son also thrown into the mix. I felt that the actions of the characters were in line with their personality. I think Atom Egoyan did a good job of showing the emotions of the characters. Overall, I think the movie at least deserves a rating of 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'When your fantasies get the better of you.' An erotic drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the movie has a number of characters, only 4 of them are important to the storyline. It starts when a woman observes that her husband, a college professor, appears to 'flirt' with every lady he encounters, students, waitresses, etc. Then after she plans a very elaborate surprise birthday party for him, while he is supposed to be flying home to Toronto from New York, he calls to say he missed his flight. The audience sees an attractive young woman near him, and we wonder if he is spending the night with her.Julianne Moore is the wife, Catherine Stewart, and also a gynecologist. The next day she sees a text message from a woman, regarding the night before, and she suspects an affair. In a somewhat improbable move, she hires a pretty, young 'escort' to tempt her husband, to see if he is prone to giving in to temptation. This begins a new direction in the relationships, one that takes all of them to unexpected places. It truly is a story based on what happens when one's fantasies get the better of you.Liam Neeson is her husband, the professor David Stewart. Very pretty Amanda Seyfried shows her range as Chloe, and she ably demonstrates that she is not bashful to do nude scenes. The other important character is the couple's son, Max Thieriot as teenager Michael Stewart, who also is an accomplished musician.It is a good movie, but not a great movie. I found much of the first two-thirds set up very nicely, but the last third of the movie resorts to some cliché' developments and the movie loses some of its credibility.Edit: I watched it again March 2011, and came away with a better impression. It is a dark drama, and I believe actually benefits from a second viewing, once you know what it really going on. SPOILERS FOLLOW: After Chloe begins to see David and report back to Catherine, she describes steamy liaisons that get steamier each time. I began to doubt her honesty about mid-way and I was correct. David did not follow through with anything, Chloe was making up the stories because she was attracted to Catherine and wanted to get closer to her. Catherine became excited by the descriptions of love-making and had a very steamy lesbian scene in a hotel room with Chloe. Eventually after she became crazed over all this she found out the truth and, in a final encounter where Chloe came to her home, when the son surprised them Catherine reacted by pushing Chloe away, into a large window, the window gave way and Chloe fell to her death. Catherine and David renewed their affection for each other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trashy and Unoriginal</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Atom Egoyan has not broken any new ground whatsoever with 2009's "Chloe" starring Julianne Moore and Amanda Siegfried. The movie is more or less an updated version of various late-90s sexual thriller flicks. The winter setting is interesting to look at and Moore's character has some interesting confusion and dialog at times, but the "mystery" involved is a misnomer. There's little to no surprise in the movie. Ideas are rehashed and clichéd. The sexual material and erotica is fairly trashy too. Moore seems to like these types of projects and themes, and she's been in much better movies involving them. 5/10 and not recommended although there are certainly worse movies around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It all comes apart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good movie comes together at the end. This movie falls apart at the end. For most of its running time Chloe is a standard erotic thriller. A little dull at times but reasonably entertaining. But then the movie takes a turn. The tone shifts, the final scenes play out in such a way that you honestly can't believe this is the direction in which the filmmakers decided to go. The ending is so bizarre and disappointing. The movie had been nothing special, tack on the dud ending and there's really no way to avoid feeling letdown by the overall experience.It's a story about trust. Or lack thereof. Julianne Moore plays Catherine, a successful gynecologist. The spark has gone out of her marriage, so much so that she believes her husband David, played by Liam Neeson, is cheating on her. Enter Chloe, a young, beautiful, doe-eyed call girl. Catherine enlists Chloe to tempt David. Will he take the bait? Catherine won't like the answer to that question. But rather than confront her husband Catherine continues with this dangerous game. She has Chloe continue to meet and service David and then report all the explicit details back to her. And Catherine finds herself more aroused than angry. Things go too far, this business transaction between Catherine and Chloe becomes something much more personal and emotional. And when emotions spiral out of control beware the consequences.Catherine finds herself stuck in this tangled web of her own making. Her attempts to get out of it start the film down the path to its ultimately disappointing end. The story takes a twist which has some promise but that promise is never fulfilled. The actors make the best of the material. Moore is excellent. Neeson becomes little more than a background figure but what he has to do he does very capably. And Amanda Seyfried does well for the most part in the role of Chloe. Her performance does come a bit unglued at the end though. To be fair at that point the whole movie is really collapsing around her so it's hard to direct much blame her way. For most of the film Seyfried did a good job of keeping you guessing, wondering what Chloe was really driving at. Was she in this for anything more than money? Chloe herself tells us right at the movie's beginning that she's playing a role, she can be whatever someone wants her to be. But what does she want? And what is she willing to do to get it? Intriguing questions. But questions the movie ultimately does a poor job of answering. It's a movie which could have gone in any number of directions. Sadly it went right off the deep end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting..Deeply Interesting... Perhaps in an Odd Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since this movie both deals with very strong emotions, and as it honestly also points out, very strong sexual content, right there will give many people cause to be concerned about it. But assuming one can get passed that, I found the movie oddly haunting, oddly attracting in the middle of all of those other items.One could argue that this movie at moments seems like Fatal Attraction revisited, or that we are seeing the new version of the Robinson family in the latest "Graduate" movie copy. I can see all of that. At moments I also felt that way. But there was always something more that made this unique - a reason why I could not stop watching it. I believe the real issue was the way Amanda Seyfried played Chloe, a very unique seeming prostitute in this film. Well Chloe seemed more than that, so let me say Lady Escort or something nicer. While movies about prostitutes seem quite common, the way Amanda played Chloe I thought was both wonderful and deep. She sort of forces you to care about her, as maybe no prostitute in the past. You want the best for her. At any rate, I found the movie deep and haunting and much more impact than I expected. If you can deal with strong sexual content and be able to look beyond it, you might find this movie... interesting. Only, caution about seeing it with your mother - unless your mother is a very open minded person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moore and Seyfried getting naked is not enough to save this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you, for some ungodly reason, crossed Masterpiece Theater and late night Skinemax, or maybe Merchant/Ivory and Zalman King, you'd probably end up with something a lot like Chloe?and it would probably be just as tepid and aggravating as Atom Egoyan's film. This is the type of "arty" movie where you put up with a lot of long, boring, mannered storytelling because you think it will lead to something emotionally powerful. In this case, all that Egoyan's dull posturing leads to is a melodramatic clusterbleep that could pass for the ending to any one of about a hundred woman-in-peril flicks on cable TV. Replace Julianne Moore with Lori Laughlin, Amanda Seyfried with Tori Spelling and Liam Neeson with John Stamos and the only place you'd find this production is some random Saturday night on the Lifetime Channel.The plot here is maddeningly simple. Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) is a woman of a certain age who feels alienated from her flirtatious husband David (Liam Neeson) and her plot-device son Michael (Max Theriot). And yes, plot-device is the best description of both Michael's character and role in the story. Catherine decides to hire a local prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to tempt David and find out if he really is cheating. Chloe regales Catherine with tales of David's seduction, which gets Catherine so excited she has to jump into bed with Chloe herself. And no, that doesn't make any more sense if you watch the movie. Just trust me on that.Anyway, after all that unfolds at a snail's pace with enough atmospheric mood music to choke the Syrens of ancient lore, the film spins about on a twist so annoying and aggravating you'll wish you could stick your foot through your television screen and right up the ass of director Egoyan, with a couple toes left over to poke writer Erin Cressida Wilson in the eyes.Now, it's hard to say that any film where Moore and Seyfried get naked together is completely without merit. What I can say about Chloe is that it is grindingly slow and sparsely populated with undefined and uninteresting characters whose behavior seems more like it's determined by the random throw of an eight-sided die than by any recognizable human impulse or desire. I can also say there's not a single line of interesting dialog spoken in the entire movie and that Catherine and David's home in the film looks like a bunch of red shoeboxes stuck together.This film doesn't have anything to say about marriage or family or fidelity or sexuality or trust or insecurity or, quite frankly, anything about anything. It provides the world with a look at Moore's and Seyfried's breasts and that's about it. If this pretentious waste of time and energy is what it takes to get legitimate actresses to remove their clothes, I can honestly say we'd all be better off if Egoyan had use Rohypnol instead.Chloe isn't the worst thing ever made and, I suppose, if you're some kind of stupid and degenerate upper-middle class urbanite, perhaps you could find something here that echoes your own empty existence. The rest of us would be better off not letting our Merchant/Ivory get in our Zalman King, and vice versa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you hire a woman to be a seductress then don't be shocked when she seduces.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen a movie from director Atom Egoyan before this one and, whether or not Chloe is typical of his style and skill, now I really want to delve into his past filmography.Juliane Moore plays the loving wife who suddenly has to face up to the fact that her husband (Liam Neeson) may be having an affair, or is at least capable of it. To find out, one way or another, she hires the services of a woman (Amanda Seyfried, playing the titular Chloe) to test him. But will the truth be something that she really wants to face? At times Chloe is a standard domestic drama but it's also a great blend of eroticism, passion and danger. The acting from all involved is great - Neeson gets the most thankless role but does well as a husband who inadvertently pays more attention to other woman than he does to his wife, Julianne Moore can do the uptight, emotional woman as well as any other actress around and Seyfried is just superb as Chloe, a mix of sexiness, sweetness and dangerous teasing (a woman who admits at the start of the movie that she can be anything to anyone). There's also another decent performance from young Max Thieriot, an actor I seem to enjoy in everything that he does.I haven't seen Nathalie yet (the original movie that Chloe is a remake of) so I can't say what is directly taken from the source and what is changed but I will say that Erin Cressida Wilson does okay with the writing duties, working from Anne Fontaine's film, while every other aspect does much more than okay. The score, the cinematography, the shot composition, all of these things and more are expertly supervised by Egoyan and the resultant movie is a great one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Atom Egoyan's Chloe is a fine sexual suspense drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just unexpectedly watched this independent suspense drama from director Atom Egoyan on a Netflix disc. In it, Julianne Moore plays a woman who suspects husband Liam Neeson is having an affair because of the ways he gets overly friendly with many of his female students and many other women he encounters. So when she chance meets paid escort Amanda Seyfried, she hires her to test his fidelity to his wife. What results is a fascinating exploration of the emotions and insecurities of Moore and Seyfried concerning issues of trust and urges. When the movie revolves around the players I just mentioned, it's quite compelling but when the nearly adult son played by Max Thieriot appears, he's not as intriguing especially when no real explanation comes about his not-so-closeness concerning his mom. Still, the movie Chloe comes highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe is lackluster at best.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What do you get when you take a suspicious wife, a vacant husband, a scoundrel of a son, and a Jezebel? You get Chloe. The only good thing about this movie was that it eventually comes to an end. Getting to the end was tiresome. Julianne Moore plays Catherine Stewart, a gynecologist who lives in abundance. Her office is beautiful with sprawling views of Toronto. Her house is simply absurd in its luxuriousness. Her husband, David Stewart (Liam Neeson), is a college professor. He appears preoccupied much of the time.The film opens with Chloe (Seyfried) dressing in front of a mirror. A voice-over tells us that she is essentially a call girl who can make your wildest dreams come true. The predictability in this film is overwhelming. The so-called "plot twists" are visible from miles away. This movie might have been a good idea had it been executed properly. Unfortunately for the audience, that is not the case. Director Atom Egoyan either tried too hard or didn't try at all. Perhaps he thought that having a young beauty, a vintage beauty, and Liam Neeson would carry the film all by itself. Whoops.So Catherine throws a big surprise party for David. Only, David "accidentally" missed his flight home from wherever it was that he was teaching that night. Uh huh. The following day, Catherine finds David's cell phone and a text message from one of his young students that reads "Thanks for last night." Ominous, I guess. Basically the movie is trying really hard to make us believe that David is cheating. Meanwhile, Catherine is dealing with her son, Michael (Max Thieriot) whose role in the movie is essentially pointless. He won't listen to a word his mother says and I don't believe we see him interact with dad even once.Feeling hopeless and lost, Catherine seeks out Chloe, who she's seen going into the hotel next door to her office with her clients. She pays Chloe to seduce her husband and see if he will take the bait. The rest of the movie is Chloe and Catherine arranging secret meetings to discuss what happens when Chloe meets with David. Listening to Amanda Seyfried describe what her character and David do together is disturbing at best. She has the face of a 12-year-old and the voice to match. The graphic detail coming from the baby-faced Seyfried was too much and simply off-putting.Big time spoilers coming up. If you haven't seen this waste of time and still want to, don't read on.After Chloe meets Catherine in a hotel room claiming to have just slept with David there, Catherine loses all the marbles she had left and subsequently hops into bed with Chloe. Shocker. Not. The scene is unsettling at best. Afterwards, the two hop in a cab together and Catherine goes home. She comes in late and apparently this automatically means to David that she has been, without a doubt, cheating on him. They get into a big fight blah, blah, blah.Catherine calls Chloe and asks that she meet her. Waiting for Chloe with a snifter in hand, Catherine greets David whom she has called away from work for this meeting. Chloe walks in and as she is approaching the table where her lady-love is seated, she sees David is there too. David turns around to see who his wife is staring at and doesn't flinch. Surprise! He has no idea who Chloe is! Chloe made it all up! I gently placed my head in my hands at this moment and wept for the person who pitched this idea and the other person who agreed to it.Chloe then runs right over to the Stewart household where Michael is strumming his guitar. He glances up, sees her, and the two make their way up to the master bedroom. Meanwhile, Catherine comes clean to David and they reconcile. Yay. He has to go finish up at work and she hurries home to wait for him. She walks in to find a sleeping Chloe in her bed with her son. In a desperate attempt to give the movie a twisted ending, Chloe and Catherine argue and thankfully, finally Chloe manages to fall out the window and die. Huzzah! Julianne Moore now has two strikes in my book. One for The Kids Are All Right and one for this wretched excuse for a film. Liam Neeson gets a pass because this movie was filmed right around the time that his wife passed and I normally enjoy his work. It would've been wise to replace him with someone else if possible. Amanda Seyfried has yet to blow me away in a role and that stands true after this mess. Yikes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable. A trick test a dangerous erotic game of cat and mouse!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film titled "Chloe" happens to be highly enjoyable as it's an erotic tale that blends drama and emotions well together. As you watch the plot it kind of keeps you guessing just when you think you know the erotic turns a lustful and surprise passionate twist is taken.Set in Toronto, Canada the tale involves Catherine(the brilliant and super Julianne Moore)a high scale upper class doctor who's all caught up in her work she feels under stress. To complicate matters she's dealing with her teenage son who's hormones are wild at work. Yet more painful is the big lack of intimacy that Catherine has with her spouse. As Catherine starts to feel that her college professor husband David(Liam Neeson)has been unfaithful. So she comes up with a little test plan.Catherine hires a young and attractive escort Chloe(well done by Amanda Seyfried)to go out and try and seduce her husband. She wants to use this as a trust test. But soon this little experiment turns into a dangerous erotic game of lustful passion and a cat and mouse type obsession. As Chloe wants more as her experiment of lust and passion feel out of Catherine is hot and steamy, it only damages the young sensitive Chloe to want more of an emotional connection with Catherine and the entire family. As Chloe becomes obsessed even stalking the entire family. Only all of this builds to a dramatic and fall out climax as the game has to end.Really "Chloe" is one entertaining film it's hot with lustful passionate scenes and it's drama and emotional twist proves love and erotic behavior when mixed as fun and playful can lead to a dangerous game of obsession and pain. "Chloe" is a powerful charged up erotic thriller that is a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful movie to prove lead actress' talent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My immediate response to this movie was wanting to remake it from Chloe's perspective. That's actually my main critique of this movie. Chloe never was allowed to be anything other than what the other characters perceived her as. They used her as an object upon which they projected their own ideas as to which idea of her suited them best. In a sense, the director and screenwriter of this movie did as well. While exposing the basic hypocrisy and misogyny--and cruelty--of that choice, no one in the course of this movie was able to overcome it. Chloe did not have the chance to even tell any part of her story to the audience; the one scene where she begins to is buried in the film's outtakes.This absence is irritating, in the least.While this film may be named for the whore at the center of the movie which catalyzes the characters' eventual changes, it is not ABOUT her at all. Rather, it is about the woman who hires her, it is about the paranoia and panic that afflict those who have everything yet still feel somehow unsatisfied. It is a film about the emptiness of having everything without possessing the ability to communicate that not one aspect of this "everything" is anything that you personally might want.This film was awesome in its exploration of the attitudes that the very rich have towards the very poor. Chloe at one point during the film shouts at her client that she has been used, been scripted into the other woman's fantasy without a thought for what it is she herself might want or need. Yes, she has chosen to be, and yet she had no more choice in this choosing than impoverished immigrants coming to America had in being scripted into the WASP fantasy of pull-yourself-up-by-your-own-bootstraps success. Just as these peoples were not told prior to their arrival what they would find in America, Chloe was not informed of what the woman coming to meet her would want ahead of time. Once they sold their souls to the devil of U.S. corporate greed and signed their lives away, immigrants became the servants of the wealthy just as Chloe has been conscripted into the servitude of an insane but rich female doctor. Chloe may technically be "white", but she is a poor, skeptical, canny, determined woman who refuses to fit the WASP stereotype as to what a woman should be like. More, she is disrespected by and used as a plaything of the wealthy. Thus, for all intents and purposes, she obviously does not function as a woman deserving the dubious honor and protection afforded WASP women in the Americas. Instead, she is "one of them", the poor untutored masses making money off the fears and refusal to exert effort into anything that the rich in the Americas seem constantly plagued by. Perhaps those fears have something to do with the tension and anger that builds up in communities when you mistreat us for thousands of years. That anger has to explode sometime, and while the wealthy will perform all stopgap methods conceivable to delay the process, their efforts are just that--delay. The WASPS of the world cannot stall the inevitable forever. One day, their time will come.This movie proves once and for all that Amanda Seyfriend's a better actress than Julianne Moore. I just felt I should point that out.I would have preferred that Liam Neeson's character be fleshed out a bit. He seemed the least realistic of the three, with his shockingly loyal unwillingness to cheat on a woman whose self-hatred compelled her to refuse to have sex with him. I found myself disappointed that he hadn't cheated on his wife with Chloe after all, and I do NOT think that was what the creators of the movie were going for.Amanda Seyfried ought to have won an Oscar for this movie. If there had been fewer nipples showing and more cars getting blown up, she would have. I'm starting to seriously consider whether too many Academy Award voters are women so convinced that they themselves are ugly that they are unwilling to award any actress who does not reduce herself to similar lows during the course of filming the movie.Seriously--what does looking "average" have to do with being a great actress? What does looking average even MEAN--they all have hair stylists and makeup sessions! I've never seen an old woman who looks like Kate Winslet did in 'The Reader', and yet she won the Oscar? I didn't think she did as good of a job as Miz Seyfreid did here. Come on!Possibly the best movie ever, guys.Is there no justice in this world?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>ChloeThanks to the adulterous actions of the inordinate amount of philandering husbands out there, the happily married ones are no longer able to rent a sleazy motel room for an hour without looking completely suspicious.A prime example of that type of propagation can be found in this titillating cautionary tale of a middle-aged woman who takes her skepticism in her husband's fidelity to a whole new level.When her husband David (Liam Neeson) misses his birthday party, citing that he missed his flight home, Catherine (Julianne Moore) begins to suspect that he may be cheating on her with one of his college students. To find out for sure, she hires call girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to seduce him and report back, which she later does, in detail ? much to Catherine's delight. But when Catherine tries to terminate her maladjusted ménage ? trios with Chloe and David, Chloe doesn't take it so well. While this exotic-psychological-thriller directed by Atom Egoyan starts off on a high note, with an intoxicating plot and capable cast, its typical thriller-killer ending abates Chloe's climax.Besides, the best way to confirm that your husband is cheating is to hide a nanny cam on his penis.

		<fullReview>Maybe it is because there are really good actors (one actually) and actresses in the cast, I had high expectations for this movie. I liked the trailer and I love thrillers with a little dose of eroticism. However, I think that the direction of the movie is very predictable. Moreover, I don't think 'Chloe' deserves to be called a thriller since whenever the tempo of the movie seems to be increasing, it suddenly drops down. I believe there are certain opportunities in the story to raise the adrenaline, but since they are not original options, I guess the director chose not to thrill the audience.Unfortunately, not only there is nothing new, but also it is boring and predictable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Erotic Thriller With Some Effective Twists But Little Point Or Purpose</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast is decent, although not spectacular. Julianna Moore and Liam Neesom are a couple in a tired marriage, when she begins to suspect that he's having an affair. To test his loyalty, she hires Chloe - a prostitute - to test her husband's loyalty by having her try to seduce him. The "temptation" takes up a lot of time although finally offers up a surprise twist: David (Neesom) isn't actually having an affair with anyone, but Chloe has developed a fixation with Catharine (Moore) and convinces her that she's managed to seduce him, which opens up the opportunity for her to seduce Catharine. So there are several interesting twists and turns, but frankly the story seemed rather weak; for the most part it hung like a thread.Certainly the most positive aspect of the movie was the performance of Amanda Seyfied as Chloe. She did a great job of developing Chloe as an increasingly mysterious and creepy character. Interesting, though, that while the title of the move is "Chloe" the title character isn't really the main character. That, to me, was definitely Catherine. I also truly appreciated that the movie was set in Toronto, rather than using Toronto as the backdrop for an American city.This is an erotic thriller - with emphasis on "erotic." In particular, there is a pretty explicit lesbian sex scene between Moore and Seyfried (which, in all honesty, really wasn't necessary to the story and seemed to serve only to titillate - so to speak) and a fair amount of nudity scattered throughout. That was perhaps emphasized a bit too much, at the expense of a clearer and tighter plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Egoyan's worst film, I think. It plays almost exactly like a Skinemax flick. Oh, it's more skillfully made than that, but you can only put so much lipstick on a pig. Julianne Moore plays a wife who suspects her husband, Liam Neeson, of cheating on her. She meets up with a super-hot hooker (Amanda Seyfried) and hires her to try to seduce her husband. As if any man could resist Amanda Seyfried if she offered herself up to you. If Neeson had turned her down, I would have suspected him of being a homosexual. The film does deal with Moore's psychological troubles, thankfully, and that's really the only interesting part of the movie. Moore herself is wonderful, in fact. Neeson and Seyfried are both fine, too. For most of the movie, I was a little worried it was going to turn into a cheesy erotic thriller, but then it seemed to want to go in a more interesting direction. And then... no, it goes for the completely predicted erotic thriller plot. Yes, Moore and Seyfried do have sex at one point, and, yes, it's hot as Hell, but, again, it plays like cheap Cinemax porn.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film could have been so much better since it has three great actors--Julianne Moore, Amanda Seyfried and Liam Neeson--but the writers and director seem unable to make the motivations of characters real. Seyfreid's Chloe is longing for a mother; Moore's Catherine Stewart frets over aging and loss of sexual attractiveness; and Neeson's David just wants to serve his students, in a very personal way. But nothing fits emotionally. Chloe's mother hunger would never take the sexual form it does as a loving prostitute who claims she wants to love whatever she can about others; but she's destructive, dishonest and vicious, so her mother hunger goes manically awry. Moore's suspicions about her husband's fidelity drives her to hire Chloe to check out her husband, but when she finds out that Chloe has been both loving her and deceiving her, she keeps up the emotional connection, which his highly unlikely. David is just a good looking faithful though frustrated husband--yeah!Anyway, it's a soap with some good body shots of the ladies. Some reviewers think the female to female sex in it is lesbianism, but it's not really that; more like misguided longing for an authentic other.</fullReview>

Deep at the heart of her problems is the lack of communication poisoning her family. Her estranged son rarely looks at her, and her husband seems to be afraid of something.Soon enters "Chloe", a rather puzzling, mysterious, and fascinating young woman who seems to be available to those who can afford her charms. From the beginning, nothing is what it appears, and soon Catherine (Julianne Moore) decides it's time to make a deal with the dazzling Chloe. As things begin to progress, Catherine realizes her husband's behavior might be more problematic than she suspected, and with Chloe's help, it all seems to become clear.We expect events to get more complicated, and they certainly do, as the two women's relationship becomes a bit unhealthy. Seyfried is a revelation as the young lady of the evening, with more baggage than we thought possible. She envelops her preys in a rather nasty trap, and no member of the family is left untouched. The film is short, and the dialog very simple, as lines are quickly delivered, but much is left unsaid, left to the two actresses to fill in the gaps, as we see desire, confusion, frustration, fear, anger, and guilt all come to the surface.Somewhere stuck in the middle is David (Neeson), the man who we can quite understand or care much about. As things get nastier, it is our fascination with self destructive relationship that we are concerned. Before we know it, things are going to get really bad, and eventually they all lead to a shocking conclusion."Chloe" is a study in desperation, obsession, and need to be desired, liked, and identity. It's hard to truly understand what leads the main characters to their self destructive affairs, and it's especially fascinating to see how "Chloe" opens up to Catherine in the opening scenes, and how she defies comprehension by the nature of her moves. We never really know where truth begins and fantasy/manipulation take over.In the end it might not matter, as we slowly discover than the perfect family, with the gifted trio of a doctor mother, a seasoned professor, and a gifted child have flawed lives. Along comes someone who sets off a series of events that will allow them to learn more about themselves, might make them heal, or possibly might completely destroy their bonds.The film is more accessible than any of Egoyan's previous work, might fail to please some people in the audience because it leaves us with more questions than answers. It certainly seems to go by very quickly, as the director pieces the film together with very little background scenes, and he just keeps jumping into the various scenarios with he same recklessness than Catherine and Chloe do. Finally, one has to admire how effective the film is, and we could only hope that somewhere we can find a resolution to these people's problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Lame Remake of "Nathalie X"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the Professor David Stewart (Liam Neeson) misses his flight from New York back home, his wife, the gynecologist Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore), is very disappointed since she had organized a surprise party to celebrate David's birthday with their friends. On the next morning, Catherine hears the message box of David's cellphone and gets suspicious that her husband is having an affair with a student. Catherine stumbles with the young call-girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) and she hires the escort to seduce her husband and test how faithful he is. Chloe meets Catherine everyday to report her encounters with David and how he cheats her. Catherine gets excited with the details that Chloe tells to her, but sooner she finds that her middle-age crisis has brought another menace to her family. "Chloe" is a lame film by Atom Egoyan, with the story of a middle aged upper-class woman that believes that her husband is cheating her and brings a serious problem to her family. This movie is actually a remake of 2003 "Nathalie X", which is better and better, with Fanny Ardant, Emmanuelle Béart and Gérard Depardieu in the lead roles. Atom Egoyan made a soap-opera with the relationship of Catherine, her son and Chloe that does not exist in the original film. Another great flaw of this remake the gorgeous Julianne Moore in the role of Catherine, since this actress is more beautiful than Amanda Seyfried and naked there is no comparison, with the tight breasts of Julianne Moore. Further, mature and cynical dialogs between the characters of Fanny Ardant and Gérard Depardieu are incomparable. The conclusion ? la "Fatal Attraction" is ridiculous. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): "O Preço da Ambiç?o" ("The Price of the Ambition")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like director Egoyan. "The Sweet Hearafter" is a truly remarkable film but "Chloe" goodness gracious me! Just look at the ladies wardrobe and tell me if you can guess what was in Egoyan's mind. Julianne Moore is fun to watch but she does what she usually does, she acts. I'm always so aware of her acting that I'm distracted out of the story. Liam Neeson seems utterly lost and the girl? Amanda Sygfried? Oh, mama mia! She looks like a grotesque blueprint for a new Goldie Hawn. I thought her was one of the worst performances I've seen in a long long time. I suspect Egoyan's intentions were mostly commercial. Naked lesbian scenes...close ups of boobs and the whole thing is irritating and annoying. The saving grace is the unintentional laughs it provokes. I laughed a lot I must confess but the film, shot beautifully, is an ugly mess</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a costlier version of a 90s direct to video soft core noir flick. In other words, a Gregory Hippolyte or Andrew Stevens project with an expensive cast instead of Shannon Whirry, Alysa Milano, and James Brolin. However, Hippolyte always had far better sound design in his movies. Otherwise, it is what it is...fairly enjoyable trash; just don't expect anything more and you should not find yourself disappointed.I really enjoy Julianne Moore and I have concluded that she makes three types of movies:1)Julianne Moore movies where Julianne Moore gets naked2)Julianne Moore movies where Julianne Moore cries3)Julianne Moore movies where Julianne Moore gets naked AND criesThis is a category 3 Julianne Moore movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great acting on a weak story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The actors all do a very good job with dramatic roles but not over playing them. The story line is pretty predictable with a little surprise twist. Still the movie builds to a fair crescendo then the director gets lost on what to do next. So he basically nervously throws a "The End" up on the screen and runs out.Amanda Seyfried does a good job in playing a wide-eyed, conniving, seemingly clueless hooker. I didn't feel like it was much of a stretch role for her, but hey maybe she is just that good of an actor. Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson play the role of a well-to-do upper class family where the passion has left the family. I guess I appreciated the fact that even though all are very strong actors, none of them seemed to try to glory hog the movie. It is a decent movie to just watch good actors doing a good job acting, but the story isn't that great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe: redhead Vs. blonde</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I happened to watch NATHALIE...(2003) a few years earlier, the French film directed by Anne Fontaine which Egoyan's version is based on. So the biggest plot twist has little affect to me, though he changed the ending to make the story subjected to a more wider audience, but shamefully became a faulty stroke as the intention is feasible as Egoyan simply failed to do so by rushing hastily to finish the film in merely 96 minutes, the intense climax should have been handled with more care instead of a banal fall-from-the-window kitsch. One thing for sure is that the film is highly entertaining, for me it is a little bit surprised to see Egoyan has shucked off his auteurism wind coat to take on a mission for a more Hollywood erotic thriller/drama. Luckily his personal traits permeate all the way among the high-end aura, plus Toronto could never be more lovely in this film. This gripping film virtually analyzes a sad-but-true paradox traps most modern married couples, to question loyalty and sexuality, to recoup orgasm which has chronically waned away with one's significant other. Although the intruder Chloe in the film is an extreme complexion, the thrilling experience has given me some goose bumps.It is interesting to see Julianne Moore has been on her reborn trilogy to become a lesbian, from A SINGLE MAN (in love with a gay man), now is CHLOE (time to kiss and have sex with a hot young girl and really like it) and finally THE KIDS ARE ALL RIGHT (yet to be watched though but her wife is Annette Benning, would it be scary?). Moore is superb to portrayal a vulnerable/desperate middle-aged wife which totally differs with Fanny Ardent in NATHALIE... (a typical Fanny Ardent). Seyfried is as delightful as an innocent angel in this film, her charm is truly irresistible. Neeson is marginalized, but solid as well (her wife Natasha Richardson died during the shooting, but I could never tell in his consistent performance, bravo!). A closing remark: one could expect more from Egoyan with his exuberant cast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Julianne Moore seems to have a good hand with the choice of her roles. While the movie has it's flaws (and comparing it to another one would spoil the fun as much as to talk about character motivation is, which unfortunately quite a few reviews did), it still is a showcase for her to experiment and try something new. Which of course is not only true for Ms. Moore.While talking about the plot of this thriller might be revealing in one way or another, I'll just stick with the button: Marriage troubles and how humans behave in that situation. Of course there is much more to be found here, but that is for you to discover, if that is what you want to do. Not the best movie/try in that regard, but with a more than stellar cast, this does have it's moments. Watch for the extras in the Disc to see more .... and maybe realize why there was a problem or two in the first (or last) place ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new variation of that old classic Fatal Attraction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie deals with the situation of a partner in a marriage believing that a spouse has lost sexual interest. A middle aged female gynecologist (Julianne Moore) suspects that her college professor husband (Liam Neeson), who always seems to flirt with his female students, may be having an affair. She finds Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), a younger but very experienced woman, at a nightclub. She hires her to approach her husband to determine if he seems interested in her. Chloe is to report to the concerned wife as to the results of the encounters. It is clear that from the beginning of meetings between two women, that there was an intense sexual attraction. Chloe is a contemporary of the physician's son who is starting a career as concert pianists as well as beginning to bring women home. He has a chance meeting with Chloe, which further complicates things. The story turns on an interesting variation of the of plot of the classic film Fatal Attraction. Director Atom Egoyan provided fast pacing to this intense drama. Julianne Moore expresses the intensity of her emotions very well through her facial expression. The movie was surprisingly explicit especially since we viewed in flight where sexually scenes usually are toned down; on the other hand it was an international airline.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent melodramatic film about obsession and paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first thought this film was going to be about a girl that goes all psycho for most part of the movie because of an obsession with another person. That wasn't really the case after actually viewing the movie, but I actually kinda liked the direction this went and more original since there is already a bunch of movies about a psycho obsessed girl. I must say though Julianne Moore that played the wife, is probably the most annoying wife character I seen in a while. Not only is she stupid, she is super paranoid. Actually her being paranoid is slightly understandable but she is super stupid and annoying to watch. I guess her character had to be like that in order to move the plot along, but it was still irritating to watch because some of the audiences including me can catch on to what is going on fairly quick. I had not sympathy for the wife, but I liked how it goes in a direction where the audience don't feel sympathy for Amanda Seyfreid's character who played Chloe who is basically a prostitute that is used to check up on the wife's husband, if he is cheating on her or not. Although I was surfing the web while watching this film, because I could tell what is going one without actually seeing the screen for about 25% of the time, this is still a decent movie about a women who is having a mid life crisis that goes out of control because of paranoia. There are also some sexually erotic scenes in this film, that has sex scenes for a reason and is actually more to move the plot along and the perception than to just show nudity. It would have been a lot better if it wasn't so predictable, because many casual movie watchers can spot what is going on before the film comes close to ending.6.3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Chloe" is a disaster, a misguided and pretentious film that believes it's making a grand statement about sex and human nature until resorting to terrible, manipulative writing in the last act in order to force a pointless finale. It's like a soft-core flick on Showtime trying to get an Oscar nomination, and it isn't smart or sexual... it's just tedious.The great Julianne Moore plays Catherine Stewart, a repressed gynecologist whose marriage to husband David (Liam Neeson) is slowly eroding over the course of many years and his many affairs. Catherine secretly hires classy call-girl Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to seduce her husband and test his fidelity but here's where the movie goes wrong: Catherine doesn't have any reaction to finding out her husband is a cheater.You might expect her to be angry, hurt, devastated... but she's not. Maybe she gets a kinky thrill from the prostitute's detailed descriptions of these hook-ups: after all we do see her masturbating in the shower as she replays the scenario. The trouble is this avenue is never explored- or even mentioned- for the rest of the film. So what is her motivation? Maybe she's ready to confront her husband, to divorce him, to address the hypocrisy in her own life. Except she does none of that. She seems to be going through the motions because the script tells her to. I am a tremendous fan of Julianne Moore but her performance here is almost an intentional void. She's never allowed to behave based on her character's natural reactions, mainly because her character doesn't have any.When she finally shacks up with Chloe herself it's as unsatisfying as it is confusing: she showed no signs of attraction to the girl whatsoever. Is she a closeted lesbian? I don't think so... first off that would be an incredibly trite plot development- done thousands of times- and secondly she describes in great detail how very deeply in love she and her husband once were. Aside from the generous nudity, Chloe and Catherine in bed offers no solution or explanation for either character. It's not even sexy... it just happens.Amanda Seyfried is vibrant as the whore. Her eyes and face tell the story of a lost soul- too beautiful to ever be taken seriously- and she fills the non-character with as much personality as can be expected. After all, Chloe the prostitute is not a person, just a metaphor for sex. Well, she is until the third act, when the script calls for her to fall madly in love (?) with Catherine and turn psychotic. This is where the film completely falls apart.Chloe is dumped/terminated by Catherine, so of course the scorned hooker immediately seduces Catherine's son. This makes less sense than it sounds. We're led to believe that she does this to get into Catherine's house and get closer to the woman she suddenly loves more than life itself. Reality check: the idea of a hooker falling in love with a client is beyond Looney Tunes. Secondly, there are no hints or clues of this happening- not even a single emotional connection between the two- before their sudden hookup. Third, after sex Chloe and the son simply fall asleep in Catherine's bed, both evidently unaware that they would be discovered. Chloe generously agrees to fall out of the bedroom window and die, if only to try and give the film some sense of closure- talk about your hookers with a heart of gold.And that's that. We know less about the characters at the end than we did at the beginning. Why did Catherine do any of this? Who was Chloe? Is the rumpled and weepy Liam Neeson actually having an affair? Who cares? What makes this movie so much worse is the pretentious direction by Atom Egoyan, who moves things along at a slow and ponderous pace, giving you plenty of time to notice the lack of substance and story. Too bad... If you want a good lesbian sex scene that will get your juices flowing I suggest a soft-core porn on Showtime. It's much more honest, and much more fun.GRADE: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan, the distinguished Canadian director, decided to rework on the French film "Nathalie" directed, and written by Anne Fontaine, who is given credit for having made the original. The screenplay is an adaptation by Erin Cressida Wilson, who was responsible for "Fur", based on photographer Diane Arbus' life, and "Secretary". Ms. Wilson is no strange to taking risky subjects, as she shows here. Mr. Egoyan shows that he is a natural for this genre as he has proved again, and again.This is a story with a twist. The action is seen through Catherine's eyes. She suspects her husband is cheating on her when she finds a photo of him with a young woman. It is natural for Catherine to assume the worst, when a set of circumstances point out to David Stewart, her handsome husband is seeing younger women. Catherine, a gynecologist, is intrigued by a young woman she spots entering, and exiting with an older man from a hotel near her office. Earlier, examining a patient, she is puzzled by a question raised by the woman she is examining. The question is about orgasm and the patient's lack of them. Catherine explains it has to do with muscle contraction, something that is natural and in due time can be felt when the conditions are right.Catherine, who has observed the strange girl she thinks is a high paid call girl, going after her at the bar of the hotel. Little prepares Cahterine for an involuntary encounter while using the toilet in the ladies' room. For all appearances, the woman on the other stall has been there to find a sexual adventure. In fact, the other woman turns out to be Chloe. Catherine proposes to pay Chloe to tail the husband and see how he will react to her.Little does Caherine know what she is getting to. The action changes into an erotic tale involving Chloe and Catherine, whose true feelings get an emotional charge when the right emotions Catherine has bottled inside her come to the surface. Everything will backfire when Chloe turns out to be someone the gynecologist never thought she would be.Atom Egoyan gets amazing performances from Julianne Moore, who is an accomplished actress in her own right, and a surprising turn by Amanda Seyfried, who up to now we have only seen doing ingenues and nice girls next door types. Ms. Moore and Ms. Seyfried make an impact in the overall impact of the film. The racy treatment of the material employed by Mr. Egoyan will not please everyone, but it is something quite credible that must be more prevalent, although the issue being raised in the film is not usually found in mainstream filmmaking. Liam Neeson has nothing to do as the husband.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>it usually means, it's not that good. That is the case with Chloe. First, the director uses shock value by having Chloe describe in detail her affair with Catherine's husband, David. Then they show a graphic scene of Chloe and Catherine together having an affair. You know all of that was for publicity and to try to entice teenage boys to see this.And the ending was dull. They should have had Chloe go a little more psycho than just seducing Catherine's son. And the ending was basically an accident, should have been more thrilling.FINAL VERDICT: I guess if you are fan of stalker movies, then you'll want to check this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Highly interesting and somewhat chilling film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Credit IMDb) Catherine and David, she a doctor, he a professor, are at first glance the perfect couple. Happily married with a talented teenage son, they appear to have an idyllic life. But when David misses a flight and his surprise birthday party, Catherine's long simmering suspicions rise to the surface. Suspecting infidelity, she decides to hire an escort to seduce her husband and test his loyalty. Catherine finds herself 'directing' Chloe's encounters with David, and Chloe's end of the bargain is to report back, the descriptions becoming increasingly graphic as the meetings multiply.What really makes Chloe as engaging as it is are the three central characters, Liam Neeson, Amanda Seyfried, and Julianne Moore. Julianne's paranoia throughout the first half of Neeson being growingly unattached to her is interesting and saddening. I also enjoyed how Seyfried tried to manipulate her way through the family. It's suspenseful, chilling, and erotic. Only complaint is the abrupt ending.Performances Julianne Moore is the heart of the film. Her descent into paranoia is not fun to watch, but it's certainly the focal point of the film. Her interaction with Amanda Seyfried is not only creepy, but erotic and sensual. I also felt her scenes and chemistry with Liam Neeson felt real. Liam Neeson is class as per usual, and his presence is unlike any other. Amanda Seyfried is gorgeous on the eyes, and an utter beauty. She was simply fantastic in her role, and not only creepy, but sensual and sexy at the same time. Max Thieriot is solid in his role as the son, if nothing else bit of an unlikable character though.Bottom Line Chloe is a pretty good erotic drama, acted to perfection.

		<shortDescription>No Mystery Nor Suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "Chloe," I felt a little disappointed and misled. While the acting and directing pedigree of the film seems to indicate an intelligent and sophisticated film, the script is really little more than yet another variation on "Fatal Attraction." I've seen parts of "Natalie", the French film "Chloe" is based on, and from what I saw the film looked like a mature exploration of the disconnection of a middle-aged couple. But "Chloe" seems to reinforce so many of the tired stereotypes about sex and romance that come from American films ... most notably, the ridiculous idea that a couple who has been together for decades are still supposed to be behaving like they are in the initial infatuation stage of the relationship, and if they're not, that they've somehow "lost" something.Julianne Moore, one of modern cinema's best actresses, gives the same outstanding performance she gives in pretty much everything she's in. She plays Catherine, a gynecologist whose marriage to a professor has lost its spark over the years. (Well, duh. Juggling two successful careers and raising an almost grown son will do that to a couple.) When Catherine finds reason to suspect that her husband might have had a dalliance with a student, she makes the bizarre decision to hire a doe-eyed escort, Chloe (Amanda Seyfried, who has never looked so delicious) to try and seduce her husband and report back to her.What follows is an even more bizarre and outlandish series of events which proceed to reveal that Chloe, a young woman who clearly has "mother issues," is in fact sexually obsessed with Catherine and not, as Catherine fears, attracted to either her husband or barely legal son. Since the film never really gives the audience enough reason to believe in Chloe's feelings or actions, by the end of the film the whole thing really just becomes kind of silly.Chloe might be worth a watch for its good performances, sumptuous art direction, and sexual titillation. But it doesn't offer much intelligent insight into the subjects of relationships, sexuality, or prostitution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Subtle and Entertaining Sexual thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this film very much and it is without doubt one of the most interesting films of 2010. I have yet to see 'nathalie' and I am undecided whether the plot is 'predictable' even after watching it on DVD five times.I watched it again last night after reading some of the reviews. Like 'Burning Plain', it is one of those films which you simply must watch more than once in order to pick up the subtleties the director adds to the film in so many ways.The hairpin is the obvious one. It is a feature of the film in several scenes, particularly at the beginning part and then again at the end. We are left in no doubt at the end as to its meaning in the film.A disturbing love story for the middle aged? I don't think so. Chloe is surely disturbed by unknown events which have happened in her life which lead to become both the exploiter and the exploited. The same can be said for different reasons about Catherine where Julianne Moore turns in a superb performance and far superior to her minimal role in 'A Single Man' with Colin Firth.Liam Neeson has made a habit recently of playing 'triangle love stories' and more notably recently in 'The other Man'. I don't know what happened to his wife in real life or what they had to do to change the ending to adapt accordingly. The ending worked for me - just - but only just not too dissimilar to the ending in 'Lovely Bones'.I hear comparisons of Amanda Siegfried to Marilyn Monroe. hardly I would say in exclamation however sexy she was in this particular movie, I have yet to see 'Dear John' and 'letters to Juliet'.I am mystified still by one section towards the end. Catherine has returned home and calls Chloe to say that she had called David (the husband) but Chloe says that it was David who called her. Cant work this out.David was of course the 'victim' throughout the film. A hardworking attractive but flirtatious man who loved his wife to whom he pointed out in conversation that 'she had stopped picking up at the airport' and 'stopped touching him'.This is a much better film than 'Fatal Attraction'. There is no sensationalism in this movie, just pure drama and good acting throughout. Not all films need a good Plot to be successful and appealing, this is one of them.All wives probably suspect their husbands of infidelity at some point during the marriage and all husbands feel the bait of temptation; whether they take it is conjectural. The role of Chloe is not understated. She is an escort who meets men (and women) for money. Escorts have feelings also (believe it or not) but it is conjectural whether she really had an emotional attachment to Catherine or a material attachment at best (reflected by the scene when she is making love in Catherines bedroom with the son).I like the way Catherine first sees Chloe from her office window and then proceeds (by chance it would seem) (but was it really?)to meet her. I doubt Catherine had any emotional feeling for Chloe, it was a business arrangement, she got her answers from Chloe and probably believed at the end that David was being faithful to her.Wonderful movie! Wont win any Oscars but it entertains and it questions our mind without taxing it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*may contain spoilers* I watched this on a whim and do not regret it! I normally do not like Moore, but this was definitely the right role for her. She played the obsessed worrywart so well and convincingly. I adore Liam in everything, so it was amazing to see him-albeit a bit difficult to think he'd cheat on his wife. I didn't really fully accept that he was cheating to begin with either (and that in the end is a good thing). There are lots of surprises in this film that may shock you, or at the very least strike you and make you re-think the whole movie watching experience. Movies sometimes set you up for things that are NOT there, (and I'll leave it at that). Amanda has become my favorite actress by far, and this role solidified that for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing ending for an otherwise excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This one is my first Aton Egoyan movie. Excellent director. The whole thing runs as a Roll Royce motor, smoothly, impeccably, noiselessly. We are introduce in a world of upper class people, well educated, well behaved. Their houses are upper class architecture, as their offices and the gathering places they frequent. Even their prostitutes are upper class, since they have learned similar manners from their clients. Everything is squeaky clean, spic-and-span. After delighting myself with every architectural and decorative detail in that magnificent blood red contemporary designed house, I was truly surprised at the ease that whole window panes can be taken out of their frames --to be easily handled by the cleaning service people I suppose-- but that is a technical detail that only bothered me after the movie was over. This movie is almost perfect throughout its whole running time, save for the very ending, were everything should have its resolution and the final piece of the jigsaw set in its place. But it isn't.That little hole remains bluntly exposed. Pitifully so.The very last two scenes removed us from the previous perfection. What happened?? Are we, all of a sudden, seeing another movie?? Where are the enormous consequences of everything told before?? There are no sequels for the whole mess?? Where they afraid to go all the way and show us how a case like this one will end for all participants involved in it?? What a pity really.They didn't dare to go all the way. Hollywood as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Okay, but not great</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into this mostly because Julianne Moore is in it and so knew little about the plot. Surprise! Moore's character hires a high end prostitute to seduce her husband who she suspects of having an affair. This leads to a case of intrigue for the wife, that leads to a array of twists and turns.It is a clever film, it looks stylish and one of the main twists really had me amazed I didn't see it coming. The script at times is a little painful and the audience responded to this with some chuckles throughout, which is a shame as it's not a bad film. The film highlights sexual desire, coupled with dishonesty and a lack of trust and has some good moments in it. As I said it is a clever film. It reminds me of some of those 90's films like Single White Female or Fatal Attraction, although it never becomes too clichéd. But so much is added and never explained, the son for instance and his relationship with his mother is never explored or explained.There are some fine performances from the two female leads. I think Julianne Moore is one of the finer actors out there and Amanda Seyfried had come along long way from 'Mamma Mia' and looks stunning throughout. The film has some really great points and works well on some levels such as acting and style, but fails in others as it never really manages to pull the story together successfully.More of my reviews at my site iheartfilm.weebly.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's "Chloe" could have been a masterpiece. The cinematography of this film is beautiful in many places. There were also great performances in this film, except for Julianne Moore's who for some strange reason seems so cold and distant and lacks the passion to make the love scenes in this movie seem believable.But the main problem with this film is the plot. The story is too predictable. We already knew that Catherine Stewart (Julianne Moore) and the prostitute Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) were going to have a lesbian relationship. Why else would the first scene show Catherine looking out of the hospital window at Chloe? I also knew that the catalyst for the relationship was a lie, because it was obvious to me that Chloe lied to Catherine about her husband's infidelity (Liam Neeson) so as to drive a wedge between them and keep Catherine all to herself. Then toward the end there are the usual clichés that one would expect from any film about a scorned lover who tries to hurt the person who rejected her.As a result, I found myself deflated and under-impressed by the end of this movie. Amanda Seyfried's performance as the prostitute Chloe is spellbinding and absorbing. She has a really difficult role to play as the troubled prostitute in search of love and that role could have overwhelmed her, just as the role of the sexually abused daughter Nina overwhelmed Elisha Cuthbert in Jamie Babbit's "The Quiet." But Seyfried pulled off a great performance with style. Yet the film ultimately does very little with her character. The same is true of Liam Neeson's David Steward who may or may not be the unfaithful husband. Neeson's performance is very good as expected, but it exists only on the margins of this movie rather than being an integral part of it. In other words, this movie has so much going for it -- great characters, really good actors (especially Seyfried and Neeson) to play those characters and Atom Egoyan's cinematic touch -- that we are led to expect great things in the beginning. But ultimately very little ever comes of these expectations because the screenplay writers and director Atom Egoyan fail to produce a film that could achieve greatness. I am not recommending that anyone avoid this film. Amanda Seyfried's performance as Chloe alone is one excellent reason why this movie is worth watching. But at the same time, "Chloe" does not have much to offer in terms of a narrative. Maybe it is merely a first act, and a second and a third are needed to develop the story in meaningful ways. Either way, something seems to be missing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Son</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thinking about film and how it works is made easier when you have two films that in some way are similar. Here we had an original French film that was really quite effective. It powerfully gave us the inner dance of two conflicting souls of the performance of Woman. It was delicate, took fewer risks than we would allow, but impressed by its structure and intent.Now it is transferred to the English language, a transition that usually and unnecessarily dulls the edges. The filmmaker is Atom Egoyan, who has made at least one essential film. I should say "director" rather than filmmaker because this has none of his precise confusion, none of his danger. He clearly is a director for hire, with someone else having commissioned a compete rewrite.We still have two women and a husband. We still have fragments of the situation. But the whole thing is restructured. We no longer have an inner exploration, puzzlement, self- negotiation. We no longer explore humanness. Now it is all external. These really are two competing women in a traditional thriller model. Instead of allowing the structural drift into internal issues, we now have a son who plays an essential role, establishing an external observer.This is a mess. The writer previously did well in being and writing a tortured woman. For some reason, the producers thought that was what "Nathalie" needed. Gosh, what a bad calculation! And that's with Julianne Moore, who could have made the original into life- altering art.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though goes into familiar territory, it's erotic fun.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Amanda Seygfried gives one of her best performances as a hooking psychopath named Chloe and Atom Egoyan's underrated new film, Chloe. Chloe is a thriller that is hot, steamy, and a lot of fun and very interesting and very underrated. I think there is a few flaws but I will discuss those later. Julianne Moore does a terrific job as a doctor who begins to suspect that her husband(played by the always lovable Liam Neeson) is having an affair. So, she hires Chloe(played by Amanda Seygfried), a prostitute, to seduce him to see what he does. And nothing is what it seems.The actors here are beautiful. Julianne Moore is aging but is still gorgeous. Amanda Seygrfried is hot. I'm not gay but nobody can deny that Liam Neeson is a handsome man, kind of like how nobody can disagree about George Clooney.I nearly loved this film. It lights up with eroticism, it's engrossing, it's downright fun. When you watch a film where two actors like Julianne Moore and Amanda Seygfried have sex you know this is going to be a great film.Well, almost. Unfortunately, towards the last half hour, the film turns into Obsessed. It's actually Poison Ivey mixed with Obsessed. That's one flaw. The other is the fact that I saw the twist coming(no pun intended) a mile away.Those are all the flaws I could spot. Nobody liked this movie, which I don't get. It's not like the acting is bad. It's not like it's boring. I really enjoyed it, those who didn't can suck my tit. I loved the eroticism, the actors, and almost everything about it. Chloe:A</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The "midlife crisis" in a life of a couple turns into a tragic story of "fatal attraction" of a "borderline personality". What makes it all worthwhile is the exquisite performance by Julianne Moore. She saves this rather less than perfect screenplay. Atom Egoyan in the scenes which follow the behaviour and nuances of Moore's character rises his film to an almost a masterpiece quality. This writer experienced a resonance and excitement of observing a woman's love. Even the triviality of an end of the film didn't create a disappointment because of the gratitude one experiences for those scenes. Sexual content of the picture doesn't feel erotic and is almost chaste and definitely tasteful. I was glad I went.</fullReview>

This is a remake but it almost feels like the director had the audience of imbeciles in mind when he was making it. Everything about this movie is wrong and reeks of lies: the plot, the acting, even the way it was filmed.What a truly horrible film! I think the director should be ashamed of himself for taking part in producing this garbage. It feels like it was all about money and I do hope this movie fails. It smells a lot more like prostitution then any of the characters presented in this movie. Totally worthless, I regret watching it.

		<shortDescription>"This time he didn't bring sandwiches"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You know how you get those dodgy stalls selling knock-off perfumes which sound a bit like the original ("'Methadone', luv? It's just like 'Opium'")? Well Chloe ? which is also the name of a perfume ? is a knock-off of an earlier film, a French number called Nathalie, from 2003.This remake's written by Erin Cressida Wilson, who also penned indie hit Secretary; and Canadian-Armenian indie darling Atom Egoyan directs ? or atomises ? it. Oh, and it's produced by Ivan Reitman, responsible for My Super Ex-Girlfriend and Space Jam. Uh?Houston? We may have a problem. But all in good time.Egoyan's known for his chilly, Pinterish dramas, often shot through with dark eroticism. Brains for balls. Exotica, for example, might be set in a strip club, but it's the equivalent of having a lap dancer subject you to intense psychoanalysis for nearly two hours. And for the first half hour, Chloe feels like the sort of sophisticated psychosexual thriller which, back in the day, you can easily imagine being molested in a verbal ménage a trois by Paulin, Parsons and Pearson on the Late Review.Julianne Moore plays Catherine, a flinty, sexually-frustrated gynaecologist married to Liam Neeson's handsome music lecturer, whose adoring young female students hang off his every crotchet. After Catherine suspects him of playing hide the flute, she hires the eponymous call girl (Amanda Seyfried, with a face like a Disney goldfish) to flirt with him and report back. You would, wouldn't you. And as Chloe relates their encounters in increasingly forensic detail ("We met in the park again, this time he didn't bring sandwiches") to an increasingly turned-on Catherine, the hunter becomes voyeur, then prey. Turns out there's something missing from both their lives that can't be filled by marathon sessions of Come Dine with Me.Yet just as there's a single defining moment in every doomed relationship when the blinkers finally fall off, you can practically set your watch at the point this slides into Single White-silliness, then absurdity, then hysteria, with a plot twist that comes galumphing in iron boots over the hill booming "How may I disappoint you today?"Moore's much the best thing in this, but writhes haplessly within the trashy constraints of the B-movie script. Chloe proves once again that jumping into bed with Hollywood producers only leaves art-house directors with a bad taste in the mouth and an embarrassing little rash in the morning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insulting and tired stereotypes about lesbians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with the other reviewers that they wasn't much of a script. It was predictable. It was hard to get emotionally invested in any of the characters. There was nothing really between the two main characters in particular. Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) was an empty vesicle used by Catherine(Julianna Moore) to play out her mid-life crisis. The film simply added a lesbian twist on a very formulaic Fatal Attraction type story. As stated above, the whole script seemed to be designed as an excuse to see two beautiful women in a love scene. But the love scene was in no way satisfying. Catherine we are lead to believe was only interested in using Chloe to get back at her husband. It was inferred through Chloe's symbolic comb gift giving that she was playing out her "mommy issues" with Catherine, which is just another cliché. Chole completed the trifecta of gay female stereotypes by turning into a creepy stalker and inevitably dying at the end, (which may or may not have been a suicide). This is the same fate shared by so many other countless lesbian and bisexual characters. I really wish straight people would stop making films about lesbians. Films schools really need to make the documentary "The Celluloid Closet" required viewing to avoid these tired and destructive gay stereotypes.The film seems to be adding another dimension to the "Female Chauvinist Pig" phenomenon as written about by Ariel Levy. Moore's character was a chauvinist with her treatment of Chloe. Chloe was never a real person, she was just a means to an end. Its hard to tell if that was intentional or not by the film makers. Side note: I found it amusing that Moore's character was a gynecologist. You would think after looking at so much vagina all day long, she wouldn't be all that interested. ;DI'm looking forward to Moore's next lesbian film with Annette Bening. Amanda is turning into a great young actress. She brought a lot of emotional weight to an otherwise under-developed character. Following her career should be interesting.</fullReview>

How wrong could I be! To my horror, this turned out to be one of those terrible glossy psycho sexual thrillers like Fatal attraction which I thought die a well deserved death in the early 90's. And Atom Egoyan brought absolutely nothing to it, bar from a couple of scenes that bear his trademark.While Julianne Moore does what she can with a rather unsympathetic character, Amanda Seyfried is the saving grace of this film, managing to add some depth a nuances to a not particularly well written character (I actually ended up rooting for her which am sure was not the intention of the director!) And Toronto looks great in the winter (and nice to see Toronto as Toronto for once, instead of passing it for another American city!) but that's the only good things I can say about this, avoid!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dud Ending to a Dud "Erotic" Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chloe" is a half-baked erotic thriller from Atom Egoyan that is neither very thrilling nor especially erotic.It presents an interesting premise. Julianne Moore plays an unhappy wife and mother who suspects her husband (Liam Neeson) of cheating on her. She hires a young prostitute (Amanda Seyfreid) to make herself available to him and see what he does -- the prostitute then recounts their meetings to Moore, who strangely enjoys the telling as a way to feel close to her husband. What Moore doesn't foresee is that young Chloe, a wayward girl in search of a mother figure, will fall in love with her.This may all sound compelling on paper, but it lands with a thud in the movie. Moore and Neeson try hard to bring the material to life, but their characters are too underdeveloped for us to fully understand their motives or relationship. Seyfreid either isn't a good enough actress, or she wasn't given good enough direction, to make Chloe especially threatening, so nothing much ever feels like it's at stake. And the ending is a total dud, as if the filmmakers ran out of energy before they could come up with anything better.It's not really a shock that this film, despite its A-list cast, came and went with barely a whisper.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egoyan Sells Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan adds considerable style to what is otherwise a routine erotic thriller, the type of fare that was common in the 90s but faded come Hollywood's re-obsession with PG-13 age ratings and the sudden availability of smut on the internet. Today, across the Atlantic, this sort of stuff is routinely churned out by the French, so it's no surprise that "Chole" is actually a remake of a French film (Anne Fontaine's 2003 film, "Nathalie", though Egoyan is also heavily influenced by Pasolini's "Teorema") and the first film which Egoyan has directed but didn't write.The plot: Julianne Moore plays a gynaecologist who hires a high class call girl, played by Amanda Seyfried, to ascertain whether or not her husband is having an affair with another woman. Finding Moore's affection appealing, Seyfried cons Moore into thinking her husband is cheating on her. Her goal is to kick start a bizarre lesbian relationship with Moore, but Moore, freaked out by Seyfried's increasingly odd behaviour, pushes Seyfried away. Seyfried responds by becoming a monster, invading Moore's house and then falling out a window. End of film.So what we have here is a virtual rip off of such films as "Fatal Attraction", "Basic Instinct", "Final Analysis", "Play Misty For Me", "Never Talk To Strangers" and about a billion other erotic thrillers which flooded the market in the 90s. What's different is that this one was actually directed by a smart director, Egoyan doing his best to elevate the trashy material.Unfortunately "Chlore's" formulaic plot and generic characters don't give Egoyan much room to play with. He flirts with entering various interesting avenues ? sex by proxy, contrasting cold gynaecology with lurid fantasies, stressing the way the family is broken before Seyfried intrudes, treating the husband's fidelity as being ambiguous and the usual Egoyan themes of word/image infidelity (Moore is attracted to falsely recounted stories, echoing the fabricated histories of Egoyan's Holocaust movie) ? but his plot can support only the superficial, "Chloe" eventually degenerating into predictability.7/10 ? Despite some fine acting (actors Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson turn in some tender performances) and some pleasantly glossy cinematography, this is Egoyan's worst film. Very few of his films actually make a profit, and so perhaps this was an attempt to actually make some cash.Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Layered interiorisation, the structure of fantasy, and a valuable commentary on the process of love and relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chloe is a high class prostitute whom Catherine, a married woman, hires to tempt her husband, to see if he can be tempted, and because she suspects him of having an affair. It is not a good plot. But in this case it is brought a higher level by exquisite acting and direction, not to mention a screenplay by acclaimed writer Erin Cressida Wilson, who scripted Secretary, and Fur: An Imaginary Portrait of Diane Arbus. Those were not exactly everyday 'believable' scripts either: but they were made believable within context. So although the film is an erotic thriller, it has more in common with studies such as Godard's "Two or Three Things I Know About Her," or Soderbergh's "The Girlfriend Experience." It is a collection of ideas, woven into a tapestry that makes a story that is more 'watchable' than either of those two films, yet develops more insights into suppressed sexual tension, the uses and abuses of fantasy, and the needs for love, quite often unsatisfied, experienced by people in very different situations and walks of life. Chloe is a remarkable movie from an acclaimed art-house director. Viewing it in standard (passive) entertainment terms will not work so well. May I also strongly recommend the DVD to readers? Rather than the usual DVD rubbish extras, it contains quality interviews with the three main stars, background information and, most importantly, deleted scenes and alternate endings that throw great light on the different themes within the film itself.</fullReview>

Catherine decides to hired an beautiful young prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to try to seduced her husband. But slowly... Catherine finds herself sexually attractive to Chloe and Chloe feels the same way but there's nothing ordinary about her. Nothing what it seems of this very attractive woman.Directed by Atom Egoyan (Exotica, The Sweet Hereafter, Where the Truth Lies) made an entertaining drama with the right moments of eroticism. Moore and especially Seyfried are excellent in their performances. Seyfried is surprisingly seductive in the title role of the movie.

This is the most commerical film from Egoyan so far.DVD has an fine anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an entertaining commentary track by the director, Screenwriter:Erin Cressida Wilson (Secretary) and actress:Seyfried. DVD also includes an 26 minute featurette and two deleted scenes. "Chloe" is certainly an good film with some memorable moments, especially scenes with Moore and Seyfried are the highlights.

		<fullReview>Something happens to certain people when they reach middle age that causes them to realize their current lives are unsatisfactory in some way. I should forewarn you that this statement is coming from a person who, by his own standards, will not be middle-aged for another nineteen years. I am also satisfied with my life as it is and can only imagine the emotional vulnerability of not-yet-older people in films like A Single Man and Chloe to my feelings of regret after having not done what I wanted to do in a certain day. I already wrote a review of A Single Man where the distressed person is victim of a director's failure to capture the satirical revelation of said character in the superior novel. Chloe has a host of afflictions that are equally attributable to its director but also to circumstance.Liam Neeson plays a pivotal role in this film and had to leave production following his wife's accidental death. His departure forced director Atom Egoyan and his screenwriter to rewrite the script into the incomprehensible mess that it becomes. As unfortunate as this is, the movie hides its ineptitude until the closing segment that undoes the critical character relationship it builds.Julianne Moore is Catherine, the loving wife of Liam Neeson's David. Her husband is a university professor in another town and is well-liked by his students. He also hates social events with people his own age and purposefully misses a birthday party she throws for him. Coupling that occurrence with a photo of a female student she finds on his cell phone, she believes he is having an affair. She decides the best way to prove he's cheating is to hire an escort by the name of Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to actively try to seduce him.David disappears for most of the story and Chloe tells Catherine of her liaisons with him. All of which, we learn, is fantasy. Chloe falls in love with Catherine, which is surprising to both Catherine and the audience. Their interaction is presented as a business transaction, and we only see Chloe in flashbacks to the fictitious narrative she creates. The ending reveals all of these details to us and feels extremely contrived. The absence of David cripples any attempt to build the relationship between the two women. BTW, Chloe says "I'm in love with you". Egoyan responds by directing one of the steamiest non-Taiwanese love scenes I've seen lately.Amanda Seyfried was twenty-four during production of this film and looks and dresses like an actual escort. But jeez, does her voice bother me. At the climax she has many emotional lines and her juvenile voice ruined the movie for me. She sounds like a valley girl in her mother's clothing. Chloe is a remake of the French film Nathalie, directed by Anne Fontaine. I've not seen that movie, but I did see Coco Before Chanel and enjoyed her creation of a self-assured heroine who uses her beauty and wit to have a comfortable life while maintaining her own identity. Fontaine isn't happy with her movie, but I can imagine it is better than this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a cold attempt at something sexy and intriguing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, from the beginning you know the movie isn't going to end so well for the people involved; someone's gonna get hurt- real bad: the family and/or the escort - and that's just the first fault of this film: its storyline. It is very predictable and creates such a mess on purpose. Even the part where we are not sure if the husband is really cheating on her (in which case she is sabotaging a marriage) or if the husband is cheating she still loses is predictable and an easy way of setting up the fall. But just so not to leave anyone out, the whole family is scarred in the end while the prostitute (naturally) dies. Although, strangely in the closing shots of the film it would appear the family seems closer (not sure why or how - after all the wife and the son slept with a prostitute) but it looks like they will be OK - as if saying since she was really the cause of all the drama she deserved to die and all is absolved? Now the problem is also when they set up a film in such a way where the premise is forced: we are led to believe that the husband is cheating due to what we are given to see: very un-affectionate, slight flirting with those around him, vague cell messages from his female students (like who texts their profs?), no connection or attempt at closeness with his wife: we know these may all be incidental and he not be cheating but what else is the wife to think? Oh but yes, we are never to judge the book by its cover: well maybe those who design covers should think about designing them better!At any point this suspense drama/erotic thriller really does not deliver: apart from few somewhat sexy scenes offered by the lead characters there is really no real connection, suspense (unless you count eagerness till the end of the film) or intrigue - it is a cold attempt at something sexy and exciting and probably serves as a good example that just because something was a successful book does not mean it can easily be a successful movie! What makes books so good is that our own imagination is almost always better than what the film-makers portray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seriously lacking a good script yet a decent watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie doesn't have the most original plot and the last 15 minutes or so are all but unwatchable as the story gets wrapped up abruptly and way too simply. And yet, despite the lack of substance I can't stop watching it.Amanda Seyfried is absolutely amazing in this film. Earlier this year I was wondering who is this girl and why is she suddenly in every movie? Now, I can understand why. She has an amazing ability to morph her looks and attitude. She has the flexibility and range most young Hollywood starlets only dream of. She can be drop dead sexy, but she can be believably nerdy (see Jennifer's Body)and insecure as well. She puts the thrill in this otherwise bland script.Julianne Moore delivers a decent performance as well. She plays an uptight control freak.(yes, again...sigh) She's a wife, mother, and oh yeah a doctor too. Living the charmed life but finding no satisfaction in it and feeling insecure. This would be a lot more believable if it weren't A) exactly what every American woman is being portrayed as these days and B) coming from an actress so amazingly beautiful that she can do a nude scene with a woman half her age and you can't even tell their bodies apart. Note to Julianne-in your next movie, please be happy and carefree, I am so tired of seeing you stressed and crying.Really, even though the plot is predictable, it is overcome by the amazing performances right up until the last 15 to 20 minutes. At that point, the plot gets so thin and pathetic that no actor can save it. *****SPOILER ALERT***** Let's see, despite all the evidence to the contrary, Catherine's husband was never really cheating on her and they make up and have a perfect marriage after only a five minute fight. Gee, if all relationships were that easy. Chloe we find is a bit obsessive and therefore has to be killed off conveniently and by accident so that no one feels too bad about it. And Catherine still wears Chloe's hair clip in the end. Why you ask? Did she really care about her all along? Noooo, there couldn't be that much depth to her character. It's more like a reminder to both herself and her husband not to sleep with beautiful young women for fear that they will stalk you and you might have to accidentally drop them from a window. Because that happens every day. Overall though, despite this harsh criticism of the writing, it is an entertaining film. I just think that much like Marley and Me, I would have been happier had I turned it off before watching the final chapter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective story of lust and betrayal.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan's new film Chloe tells a story that's been told many times before, the tale of the woman scorned. But the new perspective that Egoyan brings to the erotic thriller genre, that makes it more original and provocative than any film I've seen this year. Julianne Moore's portrayal of the heroine, Catherine Stewart, is near perfect. Moore has really been at the top of her game lately. In A Single Man, she played a character that she also brought great depth to, despite having only about fifteen minutes of air-time. In Chloe, she plays an upper middle-class gynecologist, who has been married to David (Liam Neeson) for many years. She suspects that he's having an affair, after noticing his flirtacious banter with a waitress, and after missing a flight, and his surprise birthday party. And just like that, her long simmering suspicions rise to the surface. Finding no answer other than infidelity, she hires an escort, played by Amanda Seyfried, in the title role, to seduce her husband, to see his reaction. She finds herself "directing" she and her husband's encounters, giving Chloe notes on how to react to certain things that her husband says and does. Ergo, the fireworks start, and needless to say, lies are told and people get hurt. This is Julianne Moore's best work in years. She has a knack for giving emotionally devastating performances, and she's in top form here. Her ability to say so much with saying so little, never ceases to amaze me. But the true star here is Amanda Seyfried, who gives the performance of her career. Her repertoire includes mostly comedies, like Mean Girls and Mamma Mia, but the amount of dramatic depth that she brings to the table is unbelievable. Playing a complicated character, you never know what her next move is, and it's interesting to see where it goes, ultimately until the earth-shattering conclusion. Seyfried's large, expressive eyes, tell you what her character is going through, and it's another case, where so much is said, when so little is actually spoken. The supporting cast, of course, includes Liam Neeson, who is always excellent, as Catherine's philandering husband, and he essentially does his job. There's not a whole lot of room in this picture, for his character to evolve. More attention is paid to the female leads. What separates this from the countless stories of mistrust and infidelity, is the eerie and surprisingly profound tone that Egoyan brings to the table. It's a very mature, classy, smart film that deals with trust, loyalty, and love, and how, after so long, love can vanish, and an emotion can take over that you never would have expected to feel. And plus the settings are gorgeous. Jim Lambie, the set decorator of films like Heaven on Earth, and Egoyan's Adoration, brings a modern sense of traditionalism to the look of the film, especially the main setting of the Stewart household. And, also, the score, masterfully composed by Mychael Danna, brings out so much emotion, and tension to the table. Shattering orchestra crescendos, in pivotal scenes, bring more feeling, and intensity to the overall tone of the picture. But, in the end, it's Egoyan's patient and thoughtful pacing, and an excellent performance by Amanda Seyfried that really stand out. It's a very mature, intricate experience that takes its time with developing each character, and brings a stunning conclusion that sets it apart from other stories of its kind. Its portrayal of lust and erotic desire, and the vulnerability of love, itself, will leave you breathless. Egoyan's use of an elegant, gliding camera, traps his characters against windows and mirrors, to signify how trapped a person can feel in their own life. And Egoyan's ability to never tell a story on one level, and his knack for adding layer, after layer to each character, makes the effect that the film has all the more effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This kind of movies have one sole aim: have a good plot. The plot itself is, at best, alright, if not over used previously by other story tellers. However the way they choose to present it is not skillfully at all. Anyone could have easily guessed what happened half way through.Good thing is all the three leading actors are awesome. Julianne Moore did a good job. Liam Nesson kept up with his level with such little chance to perform. Amanda Sayfried played this lunatic woman well too. She did make me feel creepy a few times or so.With no brilliant plot nor any special ways to present it, I do not recommend this to people who love psychotic thrillers.</fullReview>

I haven't seen the original version and I won't bother, this has put me off bothering.As subtle as a drunken football fan the plot twists in this movie were as well covered as a petrol tanker doing a 180. The dialogue was as well delivered as that newspaper the dog savaged in the letterbox. The film was kept interesting by the bap count and nothing else.Seriously, unless you have an unnatural and unhealthy appetite for the boobs of the unobtainable Hollywood A list, leave well alone. Erotic? My harris. Thriller? To be fair I staid awake for the whole film (it was the boob thing).If you must watch it make sure you give yourself plenty of time to contemplate all of those life questions that other people have written about in their reviews - watch after midnight on a work night, that way you may fall asleep and miss some of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seductive but predictable, the cast makes a difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good cast and intense interpretation make up for a predictable and sometimes overstretched movie. I saw and heard mostly what I expected to see and hear. The overall, and artfully created atmosphere is always shifting from refinement to sophistication, from truthfulness to falseness, from seduction to lasciviousness, where the director does not shy away from nudity, but thankfully recognizes that words may be as just erotically charged.Amanda Seyfried as Chloe is given that dewy appearance that only cinema characters have, Julienne Moore as Catherine is the true pulsing heart of the whole story, seductive and intense as well, in a more mature way, obviously, she feels an inner emotional laceration, needs to be awakened by the freshness of that young nymph, but still needs the love and protection of her still loved husband. Liam Neeson is not enough explored, and is less involved in situations as he seems to be at the beginning, but has the merit to be able, in the end, to embrace his wife again. In the end, what emerges, is the power of words and imagination, that can be stronger and more dangerous than facts: that's the most interesting and less banal key of interpretation developed throughout the movie, together with the inner laceration of a mature woman, who fears the passing of years and her becoming no longer desirable to her husband. On the whole, intense acting does a great job to give the picture more consistency and depth than it would probably have had if less talented acting had been delivered</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chloe: A so-so film from Atom Egoyan.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine (Julianne Moore) suspects her husband David (Liam Neeson) of cheating on her with other women, and hires Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to approach her husband in order to see how far he will go. Their son (Michael) meanwhile is a piano prodigy who visits a shrink and sleeps around. What follows is one of the worst movies of the century - thanks to Atom Egoyan and Ivan Reitman - as Chloe, Catherine, David, Michael take on an intellectual Torontonian approach to erotica. They say eroticism is in the head, but this movie takes it literally as you are forced to think - "Aha, I think Julianne Moore is getting excited"; "Aha, it looks like this is an erotic moment,...maybe". All in all, a big waste of time and money. Chloe has a nice smile though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solid Family Drama that Lets Down</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To director Atom Egoyan's credit he directs Chloe away from the action thriller cliché and rather focuses as he did with THE SWEET HEREAFTER (1997) on the psychology and personality of the characters themselves, though disappointingly with almost the same impact in both movies. Nevertheless, Egoyan has brought to the screen a rather fascinating character study involving four characters in an erotic display encompassing each of these characters or perhaps only three of them depending on the interpretation of the movie. While unlike THE SWEET HEREAFTER the ending really avoids the more substantive and what would have been a more satisfying and deeper look into adolescent psychology and in which THE SWEET HEREAFTER seems to escape by a sudden ending and perhaps convenient that leaves much to be desired, in CHLOE a similar disappointing ending occurs by a simple script device that is typical of family dramas which avoid the more muddy and less clear cut ending. Still there remains a number of assumptions as well as a weaker ending that even still has loose ends so that the essence of the movie really eventually devolves on Chloe even though much of the focus at first is on the Stewart family. This is one of the movies of quality characters, a good script plot that never reaches its true potential as a classic film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The professor may, or may not, be a shameless womanizer, bedding down graduate students, waitresses, and any pretty young thing that moves. As David(Liam Neeson) calls his wife from outside a restaurant, you see a young girl in the landscape, waiting patiently for the much older man to join her, while he explains about his botched flight plans, which in return, botches Catherine's surprise birthday plans for her husband. The young girl is blurry, out of focus, because the filmmaker leaves their night outing open for interpretation. In a prior scene, the same young girl had invited the professor to a late dinner with some other students after class. Are these collegians ensconced within the eatery ordering food and drink while David talks to Catherine(Catherine) on his cell-phone, or is this an intimate dinner for two? It's appropriate that the filmmaker keeps the young girl in soft focus. We don't know what she means to David. The filmmaker is coy. Catherine, a gynecologist, intercepts a text message on David's cell the very next morning which reads: "Thanks for last night. Miranda." Thanks for what, exactly? That's what Catherine wants to find out, so she hires Chloe(Amanda Seyfried), a high-priced call girl, to seduce David and report back to her with all the naughty details. Chloe is thorough, but that's okay, because she's talking to a medical professional, a woman who deals with sex on a daily basis in clinical terms. Like any gynecologist, Catherine must de-eroticize the vagina, and the vagina's adventures, for the sake of proper bedside manner. When Chloe talks about her husband's erection, it's just like being at work. Besides, she's straight. Right? Following a blow-by-blow account of an encounter between Chloe and her husband in a botanical garden at their meeting place, the prostitute falls off her bicycle, and Catherine, who is old enough to be the girl's mother, who has a son just about Chloe's age, comes to her aid. Although the gynecologist stares at vaginas all day, it's in a maternal capacity that she tends to Chloe's cut and bruised knee. This dynamic first showed up in an earlier scene, where Catherine hears Chloe crying in the next bathroom stall and hands the distressed girl some toilet paper squares. During the hand-off beneath the divider, we see the contrast in hands: one hand is ravaged by wrinkles, while the other hand is smooth as a baby's bottom. Unlike her philandering husband, Catherine knows there are limits. So we think. In the next scene, after she bandages Chloe's boo-boo, the doctor surprises us; she masturbates in the shower, using Chloe's graphic description of her afternoon delight with David as pornography. More surprisingly, the gynecologist, we learn in retrospect, doesn't insert herself in Chloe's position while the prostitute recounts her escapades with her husband; it's David she stands in for during her autoerotic feat of lust."Chloe" sets the moviegoer up with a MacGuffin concerning the professor's supposed secret life to bolster the rhetoric of a fallible narrator(Chloe). She's a liar, just like the filmmaker, but exactly what is the latter liar fibbing about? Does he diagetically protect David by excising his affairs from our eyes? Because of the filmmaker's pedigree, the ending, which resembles something you might see on late-night cable, is so tacky, you need to read the melodramatic elements as satire. It's cut from the same cloth as Jane Campion's "In the Cut", in which an auteur tackles a more commercial production by going through the genre's motions with a reconstructive eye. For starters, "Chloe" could be construed as a corrective take on the killer lesbian criticism that surrounded Paul Verhoeven's "Basic Instinct". Chloe is no killer; she kills herself, and the prostitute equips herself with a hairpin, not an icepick.</fullReview>

The good thing about this movie is, it does not iterate those same old styles of using lesbianism to say "We women do not need men to satisfy our sexual needs", rather has shown a very deep indicative way to state "Only a woman can love another woman", and this message can be read only at the last moment of the entire movie! Eventful and fast screenplay, natural acting, full of surprisingly tense moments - "surprising" for a movie with a description related to family problems!

Catherine suspects her husband of infidelity after watching him flirt with the occasional younger woman. Catherine hires a prostitute named Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to entice her husband to find out what he'd do.The story gets pretty hot and heavy. There's a bit of nudity and some freaky love scenes, so cross your legs fellas. The story has one major twist and it is surprisingly good. Even though I haven't watched it, Chloe reminds me of Obsessed. There's no girl-on-girl martial arts, but there's some other girl-on-girl action if you catch my drift. And during the movie I must have said, "Sh*t is about to get crazy" at least 3 or 4 times. Chloe is a remake of a French movie called Nathalie.This is not your typical chick flick.

		<shortDescription>No Fatal Attraction or even Basic Instinct. Film literally falls flat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was drawn to this film due to two things - first, its title is the name of my sweet Labrador, Chloe. Second, the cast seemed strong and the premise quite intriguing - a married woman, believing her husband is cheating on her, hires a call girl to seduce and trap him. Julianne Moore plays the role of a successful but slightly self-conscious woman to perfection. Her husband, Liam Neeson, a handsome professor, is aging gracefully and continuously flirts with his students. Julianne is having a hard time connecting with him and is also out of touch with her son, Michael, who is going through a rebellious teenage phase. Seeking reassurance on her marriage and perhaps some comfort, she sets up a meeting with Amanda Seyfried's character and plots her fateful scheme. The movie is fairly interesting to watch at first but very quickly there are moments that are preposterous and just impossible- chance encounters and text messages, eerie, overly ominous music playing constantly in the background, an out of the blue lesbian scene, a "shoe orgasm" (I'm serious), a reappearing hairpin far too reminiscent of a certain famous ice pick, an ultra modern house with lots of windows... There are many scenes of a sexual nature but without much eroticism- the whole time one senses that there is something brewing underneath that is not quite right. I didn't feel much passion or tension and thought that everything was a bit too fake and trying so hard to stand out that in the end it was just plain bizarre. Amanda plays her character's psychotic side very well however, with her big, blue eyes and pale, innocent looking exterior. But despite good performances the script falls tremendously short. Viewers who expect too much will get very little in return. This film lacks the intelligence of Fatal Attraction or the thrill of Basic Instinct. Sadly, Chloe gets worse and worse as it goes on, ending in a literal and figurative free fall. My rating: 5 Fabio's: 5 Total score: 10/20</fullReview>

The barely original idea of the story is that nobody may keep passions under control and emotions in check but the thing lacks likeliness at all in the end. When moving towards the climax the story tries unsuccessfully to be involving and attractive, the 6 rate the flick deserves is due only to the presence of the two lead actors.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If I were to tell you that Chloe has a steamy scene between Julianne Moore and Amanda Seyfried (which it does), you might call someone crazy when they then say it lacks the sexual tension that Fatal Attraction &amp; Basic Instinct had so much of. Well, I am here to tell you both of those things are more than true. Chloe is a second rate erotic thriller directed by the very talented Atom Egoyan. Egoyan has made a lot of great films. If you don't believe on that, watch Where The Truth Lies, Next Of Kin, &amp; Felecia's Journey. The last 3 films I just mentioned are well made films. They are also very entertaining. Chloe is not like those films completely. While Chloe is a well made film, but it is ultimately dull. It's the story of David &amp; Catherine Stewart (Liam Neeson &amp; Julianne Moore), a seemingly happy couple until Catherine sees pictures &amp; texts that implies David is cheating on her. She then hires Chloe (Amanda Seyfried) to try to start an affair with David to determine whether or not he is actually willing to have an affair. But then Chloe starts to have sex with David, Catherine, and even their son. The film becomes just plain dull, and the film uses overly dramatic music when it is not called for. It's no Fatal Attraction, it's no Basic Instict, because although with potential, unlike those 2 films, this film runs out steam very, very quickly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is something about a trashy romance that i just love. The deception, the sex, the dialogue......in a way, its like watching a modern day opera unfold on screen. It's a shame that we don't see a little more of this genre'........but thats just my opinion.For those of you who have no idea what this movie is about, which i am sure that you don't, seeing that there is hardly any advertising for this film, i will give you a quick synopsis..........Julianne Moore is married to Liam Neeson. She is a little worried that he may be cheating on her, so she hires a escort named Chloe to seduce her husband to see if he will take the bait.Well the movie started out a little decent. The final unfolding of the plot was a little rough around the edges, but still decent. It's dialogue was erotic, but i wouldn't go as far as saying that it was seductive. At times, it seemed like it was trying just a little too hard to be edgy........dare i say, trying too hard to be a lot like "Closer". Anyways.......the movie started to gain a little momentum with its story, and then it took a turn for the worst. And by that, i mean it got a little too weird........who am i kidding, it got all the way weird. It was like watching a horrible "R" rated Lifetime made for TV movie. They tried just a little bit too hard to be different.Now i will admit, the story might have worked on some level. But the transitions and development of the characters and story were all over the place. It was like everything in this movie was second rate.........much like the qualities of a Lifetime movie. By the time the third act rolled around, i kept checking my watch to see if this trainwreck was almost over........and thank god it was only 90 minutes long, because if it were any longer, i might of walked out Bottom Line, yes i get that it was trying to be seductive by adding twist and turns to its story. But come on, this is a trashy romance novel played out on screen. Leave the major twist and turns to the Thriller department. If you want to make a seductive and erotic movie, focus on the dialogue and character development.......thats all you really need in a movie like this. Have you ever seen the movie "The Fugitive"? Well this movie is like the train, it started out okay, but then it just derailed and everyone died.......well, except for Harrison Ford, but lets pretend he did for the sake of the description.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Atom Egoyan previously showed really grim topics in "The Sweet Hereafter" and "Ararat". "Chloe" depicts a more toned-down subject. Julianne Moore plays a woman who suspects that her husband (Liam Neeson) is cheating on her, so she hires a young woman (Amanda Seyfried) to spy on him, but the situation spins out of control.As I understand it, this movie - or the movie on which it's based - is supposed to loosely resemble Hitchcock movies. I didn't really see any of that, aside from the obvious sense of chaos. It almost seemed as if they planned for the most famous scene to be the, uh, intimate scene between Moore and Seyfried.I didn't find "Chloe" to be a bad movie (bad is how I describe "My Dream Is Yours"). I guess that it didn't really have anything to it beyond the obvious. Maybe worth seeing once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's a nice film addressed to the people of middle age, showing what can happen to a woman (Catherine) in her late 40s. The film shows how a young miserable girl (Chloe) can help an older woman. Catherine seems to have a successful career but her husband David doesn't seem to love her anymore. Her only child Michael has grown up and tries to be independent. Chloe is a prostitute, it's worth noting that Chloe is a blonde as if she was an angel, just like it was in "Angel A" (2005). After she takes away Catherine's problem she flies away. I think it's a film for women. Erin Cressida Wilson's screenplay, remember? Liam Neeson doesn't show any emotions just like Ralph Fiennes (who also starred in Schindler's List, remember?) and it is not for the benefit of the film.</fullReview>

This is not a T&amp;A flick, despite what some prudish critics have made it out to be.Three characters dominate the film. David (Liam Neeson), a music professor at a Toronto university, Catherine (Julianne Moore), a gynecologist, and Chloe (Amanda Seyfried), a local prostitute. David is a charming man, whose flirting arouses suspicion of infidelity with his wife. After a missed plane flight by David and a suspicious message on his IPhone, Catherine decides to test her husband in the only way she knows how, by hiring a pricey call girl to tempt him. Enter the beautiful Chloe, who Catherine has seen working the area around her office.What follows is an interesting series of twists and turns as Catherine and Chloe team up, yet pursue different objectives. Who is the villain, who really uses whom? Those are the major questions asked by the movie, and you won't be able to guess until the end. There are enough twists to qualify this film as an above average thriller, but it's the performances that make it worth watching.Amanda Seyfried abandons her America's Sweetheart image in style, with an outstanding, subtle performance as Chloe. She is surprisingly good at playing a disturbed young woman, and avoids making the mistake of going over the top. She delivers the best performance of her young career, seeming at once to be naive and childish, as well as professional and devious. Julianne Moore is also excellent as an aging (though still gorgeous) woman who feels her youth and marriage slipping away from her. Moore turns in a strong performance that prevents her character from being pigeonholed as either a heroine or as a villain. Liam Neeson has less to do than the other leads, but he plays it skillfully close to the vest, keeping the audience guessing about his character's true nature.Also deserving of credit is the city of Toronto. Filmed at the end of winter, in the fashionable Yorkville region, Toronto looks absolutely gorgeous. This is the first movie in which I can remember Toronto being Toronto (it usually subs for New York or Chicago) and hopefully Chloe will lead other films to this vibrant city. As icing on the cake, Chloe offers lovely music, led by the Toronto band Raised by Swans.There are drawbacks to Chloe, lack of a back story for the title character, a somewhat conventional ending, and average performances by supporting characters. Overall however, Chloe boasts an interesting story, strong lead performances, great cinematography, good music, and a frank take on marriage and sexuality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lesbian Agenda Flick Strikes Out --- Almost!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A box office dud for obvious reasons, CHLOE has Julianna Moore checking up on her handsome hubby after he arrives home too late for his surprise birthday party. She takes it to the extreme by paying sweet little hooker Amanda Segfried to play up to her husband and report back as to whether he took the bait.The film works well for about 65 minutes until the false and phony lesbian thing kicks in. From there it slides downhill until the pathetic ending -- so bad you won't believe.Ms Moore is a lesbian advocate and would like you (ladies) to love each other, not your men. With her current film, The Kids are All Right, she takes it a step farther and wants kids to enjoy the "advantages" of Lesbian parents. How sweet! In her world, it becomes HER business whether my Mom ought to have married my Dad, or married Mrs Parker across the street. Well, Dad, you did just fine, and Ms Moore ought put a sock in it.If you ever wonder about the corruption of today's Hollywood, consider this: Stars used to give freely of their own time toward such things as selling War Bonds, giving blood, entertaining the troops. These days it becomes Gay Agenda, Abortion Agenda, and praising Communist totalitarians like Cezar Chavez or Fidel Castro. We DO NOT need these shallow empty-heads giving moviegoers advice.Why 2/10 rather than 1/10? Last night we saw INCEPTION, a 2 1/2 hour ode to stupidity. Truthfully, Lesbian Agenda makes a slightly better movie than Stuck on Stupid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Egoyan Strikes Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The synopsis of "Chloe" simply says "A DOCTOR HIRES A ESCORT TO SEDUCE HER HUSBAND Whom SHE SUSPECTS OF CHEATING" Now if you have seen past Atom Egoyan films you know it's can't be that simple. Throughout his career ( The Sweet Hereafter, Exotica, Adoration) non of Egoyan's characters are ever what they appear to be nothing changes here. Dr. Catherine Stewart a Toronto gynecologist stumbles onto a text message on her husband Music professor David Stewart phone from a young women saying "Thanks for last night" along with a photo of the two together . This along with David's constant flirting with every women he finds attractive leads her to suspects of cheating. She hires the attractive young escort / prostituted Chloe she has come to know from the neighborhood. to tempt Davis then to report back with the results. What follows keeps you in wonder and suspense and to who is telling the truth who is lying who is cheating who is not doing anything. The mystery surrounding all has Dr. Stewart on the verge of a breakdown. This in a way is a very different film for Egoyan as many familiar names from his past work is missing his wife Arsinee Khanjian has no part major or minor gone is longtime collaborator Robert Lantos even his production company Ego Arts Film is missing from the credits. Having only to direct seems to have allowed Egoyan to work his magic to a new level This may be his best film to date I don't know if I would consider it his masterpiece but I do feel it does rise above all his previous work I hope this time his peers in the industry take notice this one deserves a Oscar for it's director. Let's leave it at that if you a re a fan of Egoyan you will congratulate yourself on having such good taste if you are not a fan or do not even know who he is go see "Chloe" after you do you will be heading to your local video store or Net Flicks to grab up all his previous work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry but no originality here</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Have you read "Ubik" by Philip K.Dick? Have you seen the tvseries "The outer limits"? specially one chapter which is just the same plot.Have you watched the "diferences" in style between Fontaine and Egoyan specially in action scenes? Have you heard James Horner's soundtrack for Windtalkers? look for diferences...There are too many "influences" in Egoyan's work, I don't understand why no one ever writes about it. I always keep listening that this filmmaker builds super original screenplays... where? most of the time everything is taken from other sources, and sometimes it's just a copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughable Hitchcock meets Fatal Attraction mongrel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dreadful. As a romantic thriller in which an impressionable, scheming nymphette gets dragged into a couple's mid-life wobble, there's a fair bit of sex - imagined, evoked, solipsistic. Well, this is treated fetishistically by Egoyan, pornographically, filling in the blank spaces after emotional sequences. There is nothing to invest the sex with any danger or meaning. I don't buy the idea of Catherine getting entangled with Chloe through some sort of strange, sexual-metaphysical transposition. It just seems like an excuse for two attractive women to get it on.The script is a mess of simplistic statements and incoherence. I imagine that it didn't help having Anna Fontaine (who directed the 2003 film, Nathalie, on which this is based) co-writing the script: having already made a coherent version, reworking it could be more like unravelling it. Julianne Moore, who is the chief protagonist, is really quite good, although clearly acting under Egoyan's direction. Neeson as the husband and Max Thieriot (Michael) are plain and occasionally over-melodramatic.Unforgivably though, Seyfried is hung out to dry by the script and the director. They've no idea what her character is. There's not even an allusion to a history, and her 'call girl' background, which opens the film, is effectively abandoned halfway through. I'm still no better informed as to her real acting capability.I liked Mychael Danna's music but it's disingenuously appropriated as a sub-Hermann lacquer on a film that, despite Egoyan's aspirations, isn't a patch on Hitchcock. Music and its indifferent use throughout the film is actually a striking bell-weather of the film's failings. I knew it was going to be dreadful when one of the opening scenes shows Neeson's music lecturer pointing at students to ask them questions about opera. Point and show is about the extent of the film's dialectic. 2/10</fullReview>
