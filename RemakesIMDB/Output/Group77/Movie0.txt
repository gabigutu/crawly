		<shortDescription>A smart, mature and SOPHISTICATED MOVIE for adults!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cast of this film includes French heavyweights Gerard Depardieu, Emmanuelle Beart and Fanny Ardant. That's like getting Tom Hanks, Gwyneth Paltrow and Joan Allen in the same movie.I'm American but my girlfriend is French so I'm used to watching French movies. What I like about "Nathalie" versus an American equivalent like Adrian Lyne's "Unfaithful" (which itself was a remake of an older French original called "La femme infidele") is that there is no gloss, no silly special effects, just real drama and natural acting.I don't usually like Depardieu simply because he's in every other French movie that comes out here in France, but I wasn't disappointed with him in this one. He played the part to a T.Emmanuelle Beart, who is possibly the most beautiful living French actress, brings depth to her character. She doesn't overdo the part at all and she plays it with such coolness and sophistication. The best performance though would have to be Fanny Ardant's. Hers was the most subtle. I also like the fact that she works as a gynecologist in this movie, because later on, you'll see the connection this has in the plot, which the director brilliantly ties together.My girlfriend claims she already predicted the twist ending, but I admit I didn't see it coming. I'm not so sure it has an obvious moral but I would say that it is a great commentary on appearances, manipulation in relationships and the unspoken arrangement couples have with each other. I definitely recommend this rare mature movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nathalie... (2003)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although you should never really judge a film by its poster/DVD cover, it's hard not to when the poster in question has Emmanuelle Beart looking very saucy and beautiful indeed. The film centres around a failing marriage, mainly from the wife's perspective as she hires a prostitute for her husband and get the low down on his filthy little sexual fantasies. Despite this sordid little set up the film is charmingly refrains itself from gratuitous erotic scenes by only having descriptions of the acts that go on. This results in a very 'talky' film, but still a very steamy and effective one. Ardant leads the film, and manages to give an effective performance as a rejected wife in a passionless marriage, although at some points during the film the audience is left to contemplate her motives, and what exactly she is hoping to achieve from this experiment. Beart, is the real star, not only because she is stunning and makes it impossible to look away from the film, but she also offers a complex character, who is creating a complex character for herself within the film. At times she seems strong and in charge, and sometimes she comes across as weak and insecure. The slow and subtle way the bizarre friendship between the two leads evolves is well handled by director Anne Fontaine. The slow pace of the film is also a delight as it perfectly presents the flow of the marriage itself. Gerard Depardieu isn't used enough, we never get to know the character, and characters opinions contradict what we see of him. However since the film is told from the wife's perspective, this is understandable. Paris is represented with the usual busy streets and coffee shops with small apartments, but this is certainly not a film about locale. Overall the film is a joy to look at, and very well made. An underrated gem to sit down with on a quiet afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie for Mature Audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Paris, the executive Bernard (Gérard Depardieu) and his wife, the gynecologist Catherine (Fanny Ardant), form a bored upper class middle aged bourgeois couple. They have been married for many years and their life does not have sexual desire anymore. One day, Catherine listens to the message box of his cell phone and she believes Bernard is unfaithful to her. Catherine hires the beautiful prostitute Marlene (Emmanuelle Béart) to pretend to be a young woman called Nathalie, seduce and investigate the sex life of Bernard and report to her his secrets and performance between walls. Catherine discloses a surprising revelation in the end.I saw the used DVD of "Nathalie?" on sale in a rental, and based on the names of Emmanuelle Béart, Gérard Depardieu and Fanny Ardant, I decided to risky and buy and watch this movie without any previous reference. I found a great movie, with a very credible story, but for mature audiences only. I believe that only the public of a certain age, who have experienced marriage, will fully understand the characters of Bernard and Catherine, their motives and how true the story is. I was also impressed with the elegance of the great French actress Fanny Ardant and with the eternal beauty of the sexy and also great actress Emmanuelle Béart. The direction of Anne Fontaine is very sensitive, delicate and classy, keeping the story in a very high level, without using any type of subterfuge, such as spicy scene or sexual exposition of the cast. The soundtrack is also excellent. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Nathalie X"Note: On 03 July 2011, I saw this film again to compare with the weak remake "Chloe".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>tantalising, unpredictable, romantic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't understand why this film got such bad reviews and why so many people seem to have a profound dislike for it. Are people really that impatient, have they been blighted by Hollywood movies to the point that they cannot appreciate something a bit more delicate? I found Nathalie tantalising, unpredictable, romantic. I identified &amp; empathised with all the characters, and was interested throughout. Yes, it had quite a slow pace, and there was a lot of talking, but it had an interesting ending which surprised me, and it had a lot of style. It left a few things unsaid, which i like as it gives you a chance to explore the meanings of what you are seeing, almost like a self-psychoanalysis.Ardant, Beart, &amp; Depardieu all gave great performances. I also particularly liked the soundtrack (I normally hate movie music), and I'm not talking about Nyman's stuff, which somehow passed me by, but the gently throbbing house y, beat y, electro we would here in the club, and in the car (if my memory serves me correctly). This was the best selection of high class porno music I have ever heard, &amp; I'm currently seeking the soundtrack as inspiration for some scenes I'm writing now.Big-up Anne Fontaine for delivering a delicate, classy film, and big-up the writing team Philippe Blasband, Jacques Fieschi, François-Olivier Rousseau, &amp; Fontaine for writing something intricate and involving :)My own films are online at www.undeadarmy.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Studies of marriage and friendship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think "Nathalie..." is a very interesting film. Once again French moviemakers confirm they're among the best European and (to me) World directors. Because they're also able to show a simple story, a simple tale where there's room for feelings and sensations.A woman discovers she's betrayed by her husband. She hires a prostitute to follow constantly and to seduce him. The wife wants always to be told what has happened (she also wants to know exactly the way the girl has had sex with the man). But between the two women a friendship grows and also in the marriage something changes... Thanks to the young girl the married couple will find again the dialogue. Without being melodramatic, the film has an original approach for telling a story about couple problems and human relationships. "Nathalie..." contains studies about that.A movie directed by Anne Fontaine and led by a wonderful cast: Depardieu, Ardant and Béart (these are two of the most gorgeous women of French cinema...).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting but ultimately disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nathalie was recommended to me by a good friend with good taste in movies. So, I was disappointed when I watched a well-made movie with a hollow premise.At the heart of the plot is a middle-aged wife who finds out her husband is sleeping around (as French husbands do, as her mother observes). Yet, she is cold in bed, and, worse, employs a beautiful winsome prostitute (to whom she gives the name Nathalie) as bait, to see how her husband behaves when he plays around. In a seemingly obsessive manner, the wife seeks Nathalie's accounts of her encounters with the unsuspecting husband. And, the more she hears, the more she is hurt, and the colder she becomes towards her husband. The accounts are sexy and provide the momentum in the movie, but, as they grow in intensity, the wife becomes more and more ridiculous as she listens and does nothing as her marriage seems to be going down the gurgler. Does she WANT to lose her husband?? Why doesn't she use the stimulus of Nathalie's accounts to regain some of her waning sexual interest? Why doesn't she respond to the attempts of her husband to woo her back?The twist in the end saves the movie, however, and just as well. This was a puzzling movie to me, with such a great cast, but with Fanny Ardant playing a dumb wife. French movies used to portray human relationships better this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The profound alchemy between two consummate actresses.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other night I watched two films, Michel Deville's Le Voyage en Douce (1980) and Anne Fontaine's Nathalie (2003). It was a felicitous, though accidental, pairing. Both films negotiate the complex, often hazardous subject of eroticism between women, straight women. In such films, the pairing of the actresses is absolutely crucial, and in this respect, Fontaine was more fortunate than Deville. In Nathalie, Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle Béart have what Fontaine called a profound alchemy. The film veritably sizzles from the first encounter of the two women in a brothel to the final affirmation of their friendship.Nathalie's plot line is rather cheesy ? a woman (Ardant) finds out her husband (Gerard Depardieu in a beautifully muted role) is cheating on her. She hires a prostitute (Béart) to seduce her husband and after wards to relate every detail of their encounters to her. The hooker, Marl?ne, whom the wife renames Nathalie, accepts. And thus begins the film's depiction of sex by proxy. Nathalie's descriptions of sex with the husband reminded me of the superbly erotic scene in Bergman's Persona when the nurse relates her seduction of a boy on the beach. And as with Persona, this film heavily depends for its force on the subtleties and shadings in the acting of the three principals.As always, Ardant commands our full attention. Her Catherine is beautiful, elegantly at ease, aloof. Béart's Nathalie is a kind of counterforce to Catherine. Her long sluttish blonde hair falls over her bruised blue eyes, both to conceal and to allow her a wary sideways glance at the world. She is tough and watchful, rarely does she smile. But as the story progresses, a startled softness in her eyes begins to submerge the cold indifference of the professional.The first encounter between the two women sets the tone: in a garishly crimson bar of a Paris brothel, a somewhat apprehensive Catherine sits bolt upright on a leather sofa, looking decidedly out of place. When Marl?ne approaches her, Catherine is relieved and grateful. Marl?ne, for her part, is assured and even gentle with Catherine, though she doesn't quite know what to make of her. She knows how to talk to johns, but an elegant, educated woman is of a different order of magnitude. Catherine soon relaxes into a confiding, pleasurable intrigue with the hooker, and the bargain is struck. The erotic undercurrent is palpable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>strong relationship story in French style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you do not like the French style of movies, without too many if any technical effects, relying mostly on acting and words rather than images this film risks to bore or disappoint. Otherwise, it is certainly worth a look, because it is a sophisticated relationship story, beautifully acted, and surprisingly interesting for the whole duration of the film. The main characters superbly played by Fanny Ardant and Gerard Depardieu are a mature and well-based couple going through an apparent fidelity crisis. She decides to hire a prostitute (Emmanuelle Beart) to become the new husband's relationship - and we may debate if this is just out of curiosity, if this is some kind of perversity, the willing to test her husband or the need of control. It's only a French movie that can present what comes next, most part of the film being spent with the young woman telling in many words the erotic encounters with the husband. The triangle develops into an unexpected direction when the two women befriend beyond the expected. The personal relation as well as the social comment asks questions about who is exploiting and about the relativity of the morality in this complex triangular relation. All this in a minor tone, interesting despite the high number of words and because of the good acting. A good movie, which could have been only French.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>NATHALIE... (Anne Fontaine, 2003) **1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite good work from the three main leads (particularly the women), this is yet another self-satisfied would-be mature study of sexual mores in modern bourgeois French society. A man (Gerard Depardieu) who admits to his wife (Fanny Ardant) of having an occasional fling, is tricked by the latter in falling for a luscious stripper (an overage but still stunning Emmanuelle Beart) posing as the fictitious titular character. The ruse seems to work, with Ardant getting the sleazy lowdown from Beart soon after her every clandestine meeting with Depardieu. But everything is not as it seems...Starting from the far-fetched premise that a woman would go to all that trouble to win her straying husband back, why should she then still act so coldly to him in private? Actually, I was expecting Ardant to adopt Beart's tricks-of-the-trade in her nightly dealings with Depardieu and not going out and having her own little flings. Anyway, the film is too episodically structured to be anything but a series of tale-telling (in the frankest possible manner, as can be expected from the French) of illicit rendezvous and one grows impatient with the film once he realizes that it's going nowhere very slowly.As I said, however, the acting is top-notch and Michael Nyman's score is typically arresting. Being that the film is directed by a woman, I suppose that some sort of pro-feminist statement is being made here but, personally, I was far more intrigued by the tantalizing promise (on the DVD sleeve) of watching Beart's routines as a stripper - of which there were far too few (and far too chaste to boot for my liking), alas...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One would expect much more from a dream cast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The expectations created by the dream cast, and the plot, boasted by this new film are very high. However, NATHALIE doesn't meet any of them. That is, unless you wanted to check out Fanny Ardant and Emmanuelle Béart. Yes, they are still gorgeous, and marvelous actresses, even when working with mediocre material.The film is now being premiered (even before released in its native France) in the 2nd Annual "French Film Festival" (a translation of the event's Portuguese name). As such, next to AMEN, it is the most anticipated premiere of this event presented by the Brazilian Alliance Française in eight cities nationwide, including Sao Paulo, Rio and Recife, during September and October.Miss Béart is Nathalie, a beautiful prostitute hired by a suspicious wife (Ardant) who either wants to find out whether her husband (Depardieu) is cheating, or is a complicated, psychotic voyeur crazy to hear erotic stories about her husband's sex antics, whether true or not.As I earlier said, the cast seemed extremely promising. And the plot seemed rather exotic, though not groundbreaking. The Parisian locales are fabulous, as are the fashions exhibited by the glamorous cast. But ultimately, the story (and the film) is boring. At the end, we leave the cinema knowing very little about the characters, are not greatly surprised by anything, and gain no new insight into our own lives.I can understand why the film hasn't been released in France yet, and is being timidly shown in Toronto, and at events like this one. I can't imagine how even the best editor can do anything to fix it. A terrible disappointment. But Béart and Ardant confirm their status as two of the absolutely most glamorous stars of European and World Cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked the film and I think it shows a thoughtful approach to a mature marriage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nathalie is most marked by silence and waiting. The husband does not talk about his extra marital dealings with his wife, and she does not ask about his. Neither of them speak to Nathalie about the truth of the relationship. I find this contrast to the 'let it all hang out' philosophy of marriage to be refreshing. There are many moral questions raised in this film; is 'talking it out' a good idea when the partners have been married this long, and will it change anything? Who is Nathalie's real customer? What would have happened if the husband and wife had had a row; would the husband have stayed until the end, when everything was revealed? These are good questions, not often dealt with; but the French seem to love having a go at them. Emmanuelle is well chosen as she does a lot of looking pensive, and her face is good for that: Fanny also stares a lot into the middle distance, and her bone structure is good for the late-forties woman she portrays; Depardieu is just such a nice guy underneath his philandery that you can almost believe he loves his wife and will wait to have her back. I liked the film. I like films that make one think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You'd think a gynaecologist would know better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Would a woman, finding out that her husband has been having casual affairs (which he admits to, but says `they are nothing') hire a prostitute to seduce him and report back to her? I don't know, but maybe it's possible in France, a country which prides itself on the tidy management of sex in general. It does seem a rather bizarre way of putting some zing back into a flagging marriage. Fanny Ardant as the voyeuristic wife Catherine dominates the movie though she spends a lot of time staring off into the middle distance. Gérard Depardieu as Bernard the husband is reduced to a bit player. The most intriguing character is `Nathalie' the prostitute played with innocent charm by Emmanuelle Béart, who, though 38, manages to look 15 years younger. She might have a waif-like manner but she certainly has learned what men are like and what they want, and her accounts of her sessions with the husband seem all too authentic.Unfortunately I worked out fairly early in the piece what was really going on. I won't spoil it for you dear reader, but it is all a bit anti-climactic. The film does have a genuine Parisian feel to it ? crowded apartments (even that of the affluent married couple), bars, streets, restaurants, etc. All that elegant consumption and all that personal lack of fulfillment. It's almost a relief to discover that one of the patients at Catherine's gynaecology practice, though in her early 20s, is still a virgin. In its favour, the movie does not drag on too long, and has in `Natalie' a genuinely intriguing character. She is not the usual desperate junkie - she is not without resources, and when not being a prostitute works as a hairdresser and beautician. Is she able to have a `normal' relationship with anyone? At one stage the temperature between her and Catherine gets quite warm. Or is she emotionally burnt out by the rigours of the game? Anne Fontaine as director doesn't seem to want to explore her most interesting character so we are left to guess. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intellectual Eros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An erotic game in which the temptress is commissioned to seduce a man caught in flagranti delicto and has her own little deck of cards which she decides to use against the person who sets her up to this game. It sounds complicated, but it isn't, and NATHALIE... is one of the breeziest movies I've seen in a long time. It never decides if it really wants us to believe that the call girl Christine hires to play with her husband is really doing so, but Nathalie's own incursions into her own sensual world seem to play into the gnawing thoughts of Christine. All throughout, there's this delightful feeling of suspense, not because someone may wind up getting whacked in the head, but because there seems to be more than one secret to be disclosed at a key moment and the story walks a tightrope between what is clear, what is implied, and what never has happened with the deft pacing of a graceful ballerina. It helps that even at its drabbest moments, there's this intoxicating aura of saturation, colors that wouldn't exist in real life, but glow with their own inner life, a suggestion of the inner lives of the two women at the center of the story. It's appropriate, as well, to a story steaming with erotic overtones all throughout -- this is Marguerite Duras for the new century, with two people engaged in a subtle battle of who's framing who while one tells stories, and the other seems to take in like a sponge and only hint at reactions. Excellent is the choice of casting Emmanuelle Beart as the icy sex kitten and Fanny Ardant as the reserved professional who here bears more than a passing resemblance to Ingrid Bergman, circa CACTUS FLOWER (in more ways than one). If there's any less interesting character it's that of Gerard Depardieu, and his small role is there for a crucial reason. It's a shame that this movie didn't get more critical acclaim because it's a very well-told story, with modulated performances -- the type that simmer like bubbles in champagne -- and even when it is an erotic story of the oldest type, it doesn't feel stale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a top-drawer cast and a top-flight writer-director this one flopped in France. Something is seriously weird over there; last year Depardieu, Adjani, Ledoyen, PLUS Jean-Paul Rappeneau (Cyrano de Bergerac) failed with 'Bon Voyage'; THIS year Depardieu, Fanny Ardant, Manu Beart PLUS Ann Fontaine (Comment j'ai tue mon pere, Nettoyage a sec)bombed with Nathalie. I've already covered Bon Voyage in these pages, having seen it three times and been blown away each time, but I just missed Nathalie when it was released in Paris in January of this year and I missed it again in April by which time it was reduced to one performance a week in a suburban art house, but now it's arrived in London and guess who was there with bells on at the very first screening. The English press seem disappointed rather than dismissive, on the grounds that the storyline - wife, worried about husband's fidelity, hires a hooker to seduce him and then supply a blow-by-blow, you should forgive the expression, to said wife - is meat and drink to the French so how could they produce a souffle that failed to rise to the occasion. They also claim you can see the twist coming a mile away and all I can say to THAT is that I was too busy basking in Fanny Ardant's eye-acting to spot the clues, such as they were. Put three heavy hitters like Depardieu, Ardant and Beart together in one movie and SOMEONE, SOMEWHERE is gonna think he's died and gone to heaven however less-than-perfect the script and this one is only a TAD less than perfect. Though hardly needed there is also first rate support from veterans Wladamir Yordanoff and Judith Magre, now, incredibly in her 78th year and looking no more than fifty. Of the three Depardieu has the least to do but as always he does it so well it feels like he is carrying the thing. Beart is the weakest link but she is always going to have problems with that incredibly unbelievable beauty that makes her look more like a genuine Stepford Wife than a REAL flesh-and-blood person. If ever a face needed not a whit or a jot of make up it is Beart's and it is sick-making to see it grotesqued up so ineptly with Hooker #7 lipstick and eye shadow. The movie belongs to Ardant and she takes it effortlessly giving what amounts to a Master-Class in eye-acting and if you haven't seen that gorgeous, Ava Gardner look-alike face in repose while the eyes reveal the pain behind them you haven't lived. Okay, the clues WERE there and I missed them but I sure don't feel either cheated or a klutz because for one hundred and seven minutes I was in the presence of greatness. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different perspective on what it means to be unfaithful in marriage...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was the premise of this "dirty" little story that caught my eye: a wife engages a prostitute to rekindle the sexual desires of her unfaithful husband. For herself. Yes: the wife (Fanny Ardant) actually employees the prostitute (Emmanuelle Beart) to give the husband (Gerard Depardieu) a really good time, all the while without him realizing that his wife is paying for it. Her hope is that, once his sexual frustrations are worked out, he'll stop his philandering and return to her loving arms...Want to bet on her chances?An odd story, to say the least, so I just had to watch it. Then I found out it turned into something else: a real love story. Or, perhaps -- what we all think passes for love, in marriage? Hence, slowly and inexorably, the protagonists strip away the rites of married life, exposing the hypocrisy, innuendo, and outright lies that force people to continue in a sterile relationship.Very French, very bawdy ? in a wordy sense ? and very introspective: Lots of long searching looks, sparse dialog, mood swings, tawdry night clubs, and conversations (when they occur) about the finer details of having sex.Depardieu provides an excellent image of a man at a loss ? at work and in his marriage, and he's not at all sure why; Ardant (an actress I'd not seen much of until this outing) underplays the aggrieved wife with what appears to be a stoic calm but which is actually calculated indifference; and the very luminous Beart is perfect as the avaricious pro ready to make a few too many francs at the expense of the wife's dignity. I hadn't seen Beart in a movie since Manon des Sources (1986), in her role as the vengeful daughter of Jean de Florette; she ages well, no question...As I implied above, however, all is not what it seems to be, especially when it comes to relationships. There is an exquisite twist (a careful viewer will spot the clues that point directly to the twist) to the story that forces the wife to face the reality of her marriage and thus make a choice. And the viewer is left with two questions: was it all worth the expense? And, did she make the right choice?If you like these French actors, and French movies in general, I thoroughly recommend this one. Not for kiddies or even teenagers, though.</fullReview>

Enter Marl?ne (Emmanuelle Béart), who makes a living fulfilling fantasies. Since their communication has become seldom and fraught with lies, Catherine turns to her, and instructs her to go by the name of Nathalie, seduce her husband, and return to her with the tales of their escapades. If that doesn't sound like a French film who knows what is! What has the makings for a voyeuristic pseudo-pornographic film instead becomes a highly erotic, but delicate, nuanced story about commitment and the realities of marriage. In a way it feels like the seventh chapter of Eric Rohmer's Morality Series ("Chloe in the Afternoon", et al), or from a more modern standpoint like "Closer" with more pleasant characters. Either way, it's a beautiful piece of cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Story, Brilliant Acting and Directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The French have a way with steamy films that makes the rest of the cinematic world seem bland in comparison. NATHALIE is fine case in point. Based on an idea by Philippe Blasband and transformed into a superb screenplay by Jacques Fieschi, François-Olivier Rousseau and the director Anne Fontaine, this incredibly well acted, subtle, understated film explores the many facets of adultery - from the woman's point of view. The result is a suspenseful, erotic, intelligent film that provides an opportunity for three of France's greatest actors to demonstrate their credentials.Catherine (the still very beautiful and gifted Fanny Ardant) is a gynecologist married to the successful Bernard (Gérard Depardieu in one of his more subtle roles) and they have a stay-at-home hippy son (Rodolphe Pauly) who goes about his life much the same as his parents: there is superficial companionship but little in depth relationship. The marriage seems satisfactory until Catherine suspects Bernard of having affairs, a fact that Bernard very honestly confesses to having: in his eyes the affairs are sexual dalliances that mean nothing. Catherine is shocked, attempts to gain some support from her insular but worldly mother (a fine Judith Magre) who tells Catherine it is a normal situation in older marriages.Catherine visits a bar, a private club for consignations, and there she meets Marl?ne (the extraordinary Emmanuelle Béart) and eventually buys Marl?ne's services as a prostitute to meet her husband and then tell her all about the encounters. It is agreed that Marl?ne will be known as 'Nathalie'. From this point on Catherine and Nathalie meet after Nathalie has encounters with Bernard and describes the acts of the encounters in vivid and lurid detail. Catherine is fascinated and continues to pay Nathalie for on going encounters and subsequent voyeuristic descriptions. Catherine even has a one-night stand of her own with bartender François (Wladimir Yordanoff) in an attempt to understand her husband's need for infidelity.Despite the setup of 'private investigator and prostitute detective' the two women become friends. When Catherine realizes she has enough evidence against Bernard to leave him there is a final encounter of the three (Catherine, Bernard, Nathalie) that brings the ingenious surprise ending - an ending to fine to share as it would spoil the film for viewers new to the story.Ardant is simply radiant as Catherine, playing the role of the victim wife of an adulterous husband with supreme dignity. Likewise Depardieu makes his Bernard so understated and profoundly honest that the conclusion in retrospect should have been suspected. Béart is at once wholly physical in her prostitute role yet maintains the inner core of a confused woman that keeps us on her side as she does her job. The production values are all first rate (except for some ragged editing) and the direction of Anne Fontaine is bristling with intrigue and wholly convincing in her development of this strange tale. Despite the dialogue being X-rated there is very little actual sex in this film: that makes it not only more powerful but as the ending is revealed adds to the solidity of the story. In French with English subtitles. Highly recommended for art film lovers. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The antithesis of the Hollywood blockbuster</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An elegant middle-aged woman (Fanny Ardant), her errant husband (Gerard Depardieu), a beautiful call girl (Emmanuelle Beart), lots of talk of sex but nothing on show, plenty of coffee and cigarettes, no car chases, no special effects - it could only be a French film and a quintissential one at that. Of course, there must be a law that no French movie can be shown outside France (I saw it in London) without the inclusion of Depardieu and the most attractive feature of any French film for me is the starring of Beart (I've been captivated since she gambolled in "Manon Des Sources"). Female director Anne Fontaine seems to be complicit here in the notion that a French man can have affairs without it meaning much as long his wife can share vicariously in the excitement.

		<shortDescription>Very good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just happened to stumble upon this great little movie in the video store. A very good storyline, believable acting, unusual twists. For once this all-star french cast seems to let go of the the typical french "all-star-cast" clichés. A lot of times is seems the only french male leading actors are Depardieu, Daniel Auteuil and Jean Reno. Who keeps repeating their characters for film to film.Having seen it I was surprised not having heard of it sooner, but I hear it flopped at the box office.I had grown a bit tired of these kind of french films over the years, but this one has sparked my interest anew. 4/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French style chick flick with some depth and surprises</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fanny Ardant plays Catherine, a gynecologist of a certain age, who discovers that her husband Benard (Gerard Depardieu) is cheating on her. She wonders if this is a onetime thing or something he does regularly. So she hires a prostitute (Emmanuelle Beart as Marlene/Nathalie) to test him. When the test turns up positive, Catherine wants to hear the intimate details which Marlene agreeably supplies.The details of exactly what they do would seem a bit hard to take for the spouse who is being cheated on, and Catherine does find some of the descriptions unsavory. However she insists on hearing them. The viewer begins to wonder if Catherine is not being sexually aroused by these details (which is what Marlene thinks) or is of a masochistic frame of mind.As Catherine and Marlene draw closer together the viewer now begins to wonder if Catherine herself would like to have a sexual relationship with Marlene. Since a lot of the tension in the movie relies on just what it is that Catherine wants, I won't reveal the answer. She claims to love her husband but as the details get seamier and seamier she decides she no longer knows whether she loves him or not.How this will resolve itself is what kept me watching. The ending is a bit of a surprise. See if you can guess it.Ardant is excellent, although her long suffering face may become a bit tedious for some. Beart is very good as a skillful and opportunistic prostitute, almost too good perhaps because I found her a bit creepy. She was 40-years-old when this was released and there is nary a line on her face. Ardant's look was natural and, for me anyway, more agreeable. Both women are of course two of the most celebrated stars of the French cinema as is Depardieu, whose part is rather modest. Anne Fontaine's direction is clear and focused.While not your typical "chick flick"--certainly it is not like American chick flick faire--this is nonetheless very much a woman's point of view movie with the kind of agreeable ending that will please most viewers regardless of sex.Best line and typical of the kind of psychology presented is this from Catherine as she is talking to Marlene: "Jealousy. For men it's a reflex." See this for Fanny Ardant who has that Catherine Deneuve quality of growing more beautiful as she gets older, a talented actress who always carries herself well.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"

		<shortDescription>obvious twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Catherine (Fanny Ardant) suspects her husband Bernard (Gérard Depardieu) is cheating on her. She meets call girl Marl?ne (Emmanuelle Béart) and hires her to seduce Bernard. She renames her Nathalie and gives her insights into him. Nathalie comes back regularly to give reports on details of their sexual encounters.The twist is telegraphed a mile away. When it's revealed, it is without tension or drama. I would rather the movie be straight forward and show the truth right from the start. It could have gone into much deeper waters. The sexual connections with its accompanying tension have the more interesting possibilities. This is torture waiting the movie to do the 'reveal'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the last film i commented on was something i considered offensive, "les anges exterminateurs". It earned me some criticism by an angry reader, and i reviewed that film after so i could re-consider my opinion. I stand for my opinion: the film was offensive in how it assumed it was a film about voyeurism and its relation with sex while being simply the result of an adolescent approach to sex, and its director looks at those women as a 14 year old who gets to look at a girl's locker room through a broken glass. It's superficial, and offensive because it takes itself seriously.So, after that, i looked for this one. Still french, still about picturing sex situations. But this is a whole different sport. It's directed and conceived by a woman, and that is significant to the whole final product. I think women are more internal when looking to others. So this film has an interesting dimension of using the female body (and face!) to dig into the women. Those women are fictional, but good fictional characters. The two leading ladies acting is good and supportive of the director's intentions i think. And above all, what we have is not gratuitous. Images come as visual supporters for a story, not as mere illustration. And most important, unlike "anges", here we have images that allow for the development of the story in our minds (thus visual storytelling). In "anges" we had some story about some director wanting to make a sex film, that was a mere excuse for the depiction of nudity.It is the honesty of this film that i crave, every time i see a film. The film may not be as original as it could (and this film certainly is not so original) but i praise its intellectual honesty.Stick with this, it will mildly challenge you. Not the other one.My opinion: 3/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

I didn't regret because the wait was worth.I think the plot and events are oriented for a mature audience; specifically for married couples who are passing hard times.The character of Natalie (or Nathalie X as subtitled here in México) is sexy, intriguing, and somewhat evil. She's a woman that may fool everyone with her lies and poses. Everything in the movie will deal with him as she will play angel and devil at the same time with the couple.The ending will leave everyone satisfied as it's an unexpected plot twist.I can recommend this movie for anyone who is looking for intelligent movies with mature situations.

		<fullReview>Far more adult than its UK 15 certificate would suggest, this is a sophisticated sex drama that only the French care to make (could make?). It doesn't speed off anywhere, is less than stunning but a constant surprise and delight. Depardieu is Depardieu but Emmanuelle Beart on top form and if she looks a little hard in the nightclub scenes, quite stunning elsewhere. Top performance is that of Fanny Ardant around whom the whole film revolves and she does a sterling job, convincing at all times in a very difficult role. No full frontal nudity but very frank descriptions of sexual acts make this both a sexy and disturbing drama. Well shot with much effective contrast between the generous amounts of Paris street scenes, modest interiors and the sparkling nightlife. Music ranging from Leonard Cohen to dance, through Michael Nyman is also most effective and all goes to help make what is really a most slender story, so captivating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>French cinema with the everlasting theme of ménage ? trois...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie on TV some days ago. I knew a little about the plot from some cinema advertisement but had no clue about the end. So I was positively surprised by it. Usually the ménage ? trois ends tragically, but here the viewer's imagination may to some extension finish the story individually. I had read bad comments about this movie in the French press and while watching it myself I really wondered what for? Two of France's most popular actresses and a typical French topic is obviously not enough to satisfy the critics nowadays. OK, the descriptions of sex which actually had not taken place at all seem a bit too long and too monotonous in the beginning, but after having seen the complete movie the viewer should have understood the meaning of that this kind of telling about fictional sex only serves to keep Catherine's attention as long as possible. If the stories would have been too good and exiting she might have tried to explore her new insights at once and by this Catherine would have stopped her deal with "Nathalie" too soon. I was most fascinated by the actresses' capability of shaping such a tension concerning their relation ship on the screen. It becomes clear quite soon that there's more in between these two women than just a client-customer deal but you never know who will take the next step. Fanny Ardant's facial expression for desire is legendary, just have a look at her in "Eight women". If there's somebody who knows to seduce convincingly on the screen, it's her. This movie may have been designed more for TV-broadcasting than in cinemas, but it's a nice piece of erotic entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After finding this film on DVD (and believe me, even that wasn't easy), I'm surprised that this film didn't do better in America, where it was finally released in 2006. For once, many of the American critics got it right...this is a very good film. I found this to be one of the sexiest movies I've seen in awhile, but there ironically was very little nudity. The acting among the two female leads is excellent. Emmanuelle Beart can not only act, she's stunning in this movie. The scene where she walks out of the shower in a towel and details her sexual exploits to Fanny Ardant is one of the sexiest scenes I've watched in a long time.Although Depardieu is the biggest "name" in this film, he was really wasted in a film like this...it could have been anybody in this role.I guess I also liked it too because I didn't see the "twist" coming...I think I finally figured it out in the scene right before it "officially" manifests itself.One of the better movies I've seen thus far in 2006.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Nathalie" proves that the French filmmakers are masters when it comes to examining sentimental human relationships. Now I know how hard marriages are to manage, how complicated it is. I've always admired the "honesty" of the system of IMDb, but the ratings they've given this film does it no justice at all. Can hardly believe that so few people have appreciated it.Emanuelle Béart is so beautiful, sexy, erotic, malicious; she is perfect for this role - the sadness behind her quiet, observant, etching eyes. Géard Depardieu did a wonderful job portraying his charming character. He must be more than 50 years old, yet, by the end of the film, even I have fallen for his charm. Fanny Ardant fitted into her goody housewife role, most of all was her chemistry with Béart, full of warmth.The full-on English soundtracks throughout the movie suits the movie well, and I am planning on adding them to my collections. A little before Béart, Depardieu and Ardant were supposed to have the fateful meeting at the diner together, I did expect it coming, shortly before Ardant and Depardieu's exchange at breakfast, before Ardant and Béart's conversation at Nathalie's apartment. However, I was still not sure; when it was revealed, I cried. I am extremely touched by this heartwarming film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beart Seduces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must confess that I will watch anything with Emmanuelle Beart in it. Her first role of note was in Manon of the Spring as a shepherdess. A great movie featuring the young and beautiful Beart bathing nude at a spring. Here she is Nathalie, a prostitute hired by a woman to pose as a college student and seduce her philandering husband. The wife, Catherine(Fanny Ardent) hears a phone message from a girl sounding a bit to friendly to her man, Bernard(Gerard Depardieu). She pays Nathalie for the hook up and then meets with her after each encounter and has her describe in graphic detail, what Bernard did. Catherine is a cold woman who seems to get off in a voyeuristic way while listening to the sexual play by play of Nathalie and her soul mate. It is all very strange but Depardieu and Beart make it worthwhile as an interesting curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than I expected, though somewhat overlong</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was well-acted, with good spare dialogue and well-shot scenes (example: Béart's pole-dancing in the red-lit club was subtle but effective). The premise may or may not be realistic, but the French have a fairly wide, non-judgmental attitude to sex and the idea of a wife wanting to know details of her husband's extra-marital affair is believable in context. The fact that Marlene-Nathalie turns out to have been lying to Ardant about her encounters with Depardieu was guessable halfway through the film. The interesting aspect was the erotic chemistry, subtle but there, between Ardent and Béart. That they couple at the end seems a natural conclusion to that dynamic. Note: Béart's dialogue when detailing those non-existing trysts between her and Depardieu was written by Nelly Arcan, a Quebeçoise writer who had once been an escort-and written a book about it.</fullReview>

We don't really understand why. Is it masochism or something else, it's not much to care about really.The three main actors all go on their routine, but Depardieu has lost 30 kilos since his last movie. There is no heavy passion, no heavy intellectualism either and the only character who is of some interest and some complexity is the prostitute. But the "surprise" in the end is no real surprise.Another Paris movie about a stiff bourgeoisie feeling bad. We've seen it before.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two women, one occupation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At the beginning of this good film you think you know who the main character is going to be. Bernard (Depardieu) is quietly going about getting dressed as you hear the sound of a woman showering in the small, hidden-away little apartment. The director Anne Fontaine has done a great job in portraying the reality of an illicit affair and Bernard is very furtive; although it is daytime, in the apartment it is dark, the curtains are drawn and the whole place seems shady and secretive. This is a very private part of Bernard's life. However, Bernard takes a back seat from now on.The film is really about two women, the exquisite Marlene (Beart) and the neurotic Catherine (Ardant). Most of it takes place in Paris at night-time, accompanied by strip clubs, prostitutes, bars and stuff. Actually, the two women have more in common than you realise. They both deal with the physical side of life, Marlene as a prostitute and Catherine as a doctor/gynaecologist. Maybe it's made both of them jaded.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remade by Atom Egoyan as "Chloe" with Julianne Moore and Liam Neeson in the Fanny Ardant and Gerard Depardieu roles and minxy little Amanda Seyfried in the Emmanuelle Beart part, "Nathalie" is a very French tale of amour fou. It's a thriller of sorts, though the thrills tend to be of the erotic and psychological kind rather than the more hands-on approach we might expect from something...well, less French while the material feels overly familiar even if you haven't seen the remake. Fundamentally it's a woman's picture; the director is Anne Fontaine but she doesn't make the material exciting. Ardant is so glacial it's no wonder Depardieu strays and Depardieu is such an unsmilingly drab slab of meat it's surprising he gets as much sex as he claims to. Only Beart livens up proceedings as the pert little hooker Ardant hires to seduce hubbie Depardieu in revenge for a casual fling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strictly for voyeurs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it very hard to be that involved with this story--and not just because I think the characters (particularly Fanny Ardant) are so tough to believe. No, this tale of infidelity and voyeurism suffered from a major problem--it was dull! Yes, a film that TALKS and TALKS about sex (and we're not talking about the "missionary position" here folks, but just about every other style of sex you could think of) and shows a bit of skin here and there but it just isn't very interesting--and much of it is due to the way the characters sleep-walked through their parts. There was absolutely no emotion, no "humanity" about the characters. All three were so non-emotive that it made the whole film seem very artificial. Plus, the sex and the characters were just not at all engaging.It's sad, really, as there are some good elements to the film--such as the real relationship between Emmanuelle Béart and Gérard Depardieu (the film is deliberately vague here--not a bad thing, really). The film also attempted to try to say something about infidelity--but then seemed to lose its way. But what left me confused was the strong undercurrent of lesbianism in the film. The lesbianism was only hinted at, but if I think if the film had gone more in that direction, then it would have at least infused a little more life into the production and explained why Ardant behaved in such an illogical and scatter-brained manner. It also would have explained her failed marriage, her frigidity and her obsession with Béart. As it was, I could easily see how a viewer could be left confused and unsatisfied by this film.There have got to be better films about infidelity or marital discord than this. Oh, and of course, due to the very graphic nature of this film, it is strongly recommended that you DON'T show this film to your kids (duh).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is truly dreadful. Badly lit, really appallingly edited, one decent shot in the whole thing (Depardieu crossing the flat to look out of the window) two of the three leads seemed to have overdosed on Mogadon (the husband and wife), why were we supposed to be interested in this dreary deadly self-obsessed couple? God if I was married to a wife like that (did she ever smile?) I'd be having an affair every 15 minutes. I couldn't wait for it to end. Why were we interested in visiting the mother? And were we really supposed to be turned on by the delightful Beart talking dirty? Pleeease. Finally this crass movie made Paris look about as attractive as Surbiton. One of the worst five movies I've ever seen and I've sat though some dogs in my time. Plus a plot twist at the end about as subtle as a bang on the head with a mallet (we didn't see it coming did we by any chance?)To think that the French film industry, the powerhouse of the 60's and 70's, not bad in the 40's for that matter, should have come to this. Life-sapping garbage. I think you got the message, I didn't like it. Avoid unless you need the sleep. Unfortunately the sort of movie that gives women directors a bad name, yet alone women writers.

		<shortDescription>Womanly Closeness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film about two women, or rather the two hemispheres of a woman, made by a woman.I find nothing to like in most French films. The burst of reflexivity in the 60s where film critics became the most important filmmakers has had a negative effect today. Virtually nothing can be made and pretend to be real unless it is deeply internal. This drives most stories to farce or worse: romantic tripe.Catherine Breillat breaks out of this by using cinematic sex to punch through the internal/external skin by cinematic means. But sex ? even her extreme versions ? are pretty boring unless connected to emotions we know. Here is a French filmmaker in Anne Fontaine that gets it right, even though she is saddled with the French vocabulary. She even uses mainstream French actors.The film is rather simple. We are presented with two sides of being a woman with a man. One is the domestic hearth, the mother and constant. The other is the sexual partner, the life. The major challenge in being a partner (so this film has it) is to balance these because they cannot be merged. It is a matter of integrating selves while maintaining both.They try to seduce each other. They each find that their inner dream is to be the other, and many problems come from the fact that they are not and cannot be. They lie while supporting and comforting each other. Even after watching the "making of" featurette, I cannot know whether the actresses involved in making this were quite attuned to what it is. I am supposing not, because their performances aptly seem like performances. The sexy one literally plays a sex actress.There is much too much space taken up early in the film establishing the narrative. I believe this filmmaker could have does as well with less, because all the tropes used are from French films we know. But the ending is worth it, the faces. It is all about the faces here, and we need the hour and a half of learning those faces to know what their expressions mean at the end. It is not a happy ending, though it uses a film standard for one.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

We are brought to hate her instead!! Against all the beauty that whole world gives her (and ourselves, once, too)!Where is transgression in this movie?In spoken sex?There IS perversion, but in this peculiar sense: Ardant wants to hear sex stories about her husband, and doesn't ever she get excited, and doesn't either want to have sex (neither with the prostitute) nor with her desperately desired husband?!So the aim of being told that stories is to have reasons to be angry with him???THIS is perverted!!And would you still call it voyeurism?!The only point this movie could be transgressive (the way you would define transgression nowadays.... so it's better to say "traditionally transgressive") was the end... But even this is not clear!
