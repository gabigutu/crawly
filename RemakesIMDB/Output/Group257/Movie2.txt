		<shortDescription>Without a doubt, the most disturbing film I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen some films literally dozens of times. They will remain nameless, but they are there. Some of those films are pure entertainment and have left an obvious mark on me. I have seen Last House on the Left four times. And there is no film that has left more of an impression on me than this film. It is a visceral experience and one that will never leave your subconscious, and that goes for anyone who has seen the film. There are images here that are about as primal as you can go without feeling like you are in a Neanderthal like state. Wes Craven has tapped into something that few if any have ever been able to duplicate. There have been imitations as recently as the summer of 2005 when Chaos tried to usurp LAST HOUSE as the most disturbing film ever made, but make no mistake about it. This is the one and only. This film still has an adverse affect on me. The only reason I rented this film back in 1992 was because I was convinced that ( along with Jaws and Halloween ) Nightmare on Elm Street was the one of the scariest movies I had ever seen. And when I found out that Wes Craven had an earlier film to his credit, I had to see it. What happened in the next 90 minutes can only be described as an assault on my senses. Everything that was good in life no longer existed and the fun and happy horror films like Friday the 13th were exposed as the charlatans that they were. It's not to say that they weren't fun films but they were not true horror films, the way a Steven Seagal film about war is a quack compared to something ominous like Apocalypse Now. I felt a plethora of emotions ranging from feeling sick, to shame, fear and trauma. I was so unabashedly disturbed after the film that a three hour, head clearing drive in the country was needed to calm my nerves. That is no exaggeration.The story centers around two carefree you women who are going to a concert in the city. They are looking to score some weed and they meet Junior, who promises them some and he takes them to meet the rest of the gang. What ensues over the next 45 minutes is nothing short of the dehumanization of the two girls. They are forced to beat each other, touch each other and then they are raped and murdered horrifically. There is not much more to say if you do not want to ruin it for those that haven't seen it yet.Was this a good film? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Absolutely not. It left me exhausted depressed and it drained me to the point that I thought I would break down and cry. For a horror movie to do that to me is quite astonishing. I have seen most of Fulci's gorefests but every time you see some guy with a drill through his head, you can dismiss is a schlock. You know it's fake. But not with this film. It imbues a realism to it that just makes you feel like you are watching someone's snuff film. It is that macabre and it feels that real. There is nothing else like it. I remember reading a review of Aliens by Roger Ebert and he said that the film was a work of art and he gave it high marks but the film was so much of a play on his emotions that he did not enjoy it. He was terrified more than he had been before. That is how I feel about this film. It is masterfully made, but it is a tough film to watch. Even after writing this review I am going to have a hard time getting the images out of my head. So my advice to you is if you are going to watch this film, proceed with caution. The subject matter in this film makes 8MM look like Anne of Green Gables.This is the first time the tagline has read so true. Just keep repeating to yourself that it is only a movie, it is only a movie......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The most flawed masterpiece of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Night of the Living Dead" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" are two films that received a unanimous critical bashing when they were first released, but are now looked upon as ground-breaking horror masterpieces. That is also a classification that could be used to describe Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left", but after 27 years, the film still hasn't quite gotten the respect it deserves, and its greatness only seems to be recognized primarily among horror fans. While it is certainly not Craven's most polished film, I still consider it to be his best, and indeed, Craven has acknowledged many times that he doesn't even want to ATTEMPT to equal it. "Last House" was the first movie that aimed to show an audience what the REAL effects of violence were and the low-budget, documentary-like realism that Craven brought to the proceedings allows it to pack a bigger punch than a thousand professional studio films ever could. Yes, the movie has more than its fair share of flaws, but it is a measure of the film's power that one can easily overlook them. The most flawed masterpiece of all time may be a strange way to describe a film, but that would be an accurate way to describe "Last House on the Left".As virtually everyone knows, the basic plotline is a reworking of Ingmar Bergman's "Virgin Spring", but Craven does a superb job of translating the story's details to a 1970s setting. Two teenage girls, Mari (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) go into the big city for a rock concert, only to encounter three of the most memorable villiains in film history: Krug (David Hess), Weasel (Fred Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain), who are also accompanied by Krug's heroin-addicted, guilt-ridden son, Junior (Marc Sheffler). The gang of escaped convicts kidnap the girls and proceed to rape and murder them, but when they seek shelter at the nearest house, they are stunned to find that their hosts just happen to be Mari's parents - who unleash violent tendencies that they would have never thought possible once they discover that they are housing their daughter's killers.The long, painful section of the film where the killers torture and murder the girls is where "Last House on the Left" impresses the most. Before these scenes, the villains have been presented as normal, funny, almost likable individuals, which makes their despicable actions all the more shocking. Craven shoots the scenes of degradation with the raw feel of a documentary, and while this is mostly due to his minuscule budget and lack of filmmaking experience, it lends an uncomfortable air of authenticity to the events. He also demonstrates his ability to toy with the audience's emotions by intercutting the horror with slapstick scenes involving two inept cops who run into all sorts of misadventures while searching for Krug and his gang. While the idea of mixing the violence with humour is an effective one (and works well during some of his climactic scenes), the cop scenes are done in such broad, over-the-top fashion that they provide way too much of a contrast with the film's disturbing moments. However, when the girls' death scenes do occur, they are protracted and extremely intense, and during the rape and murder of Mari, the killers actually give off expressions of shock and remorse for what they have done. Back in 1972, this approach to screen violence was unheard-of.The outstanding work of the unknown cast is what makes the film as effective as it is. Cassel and Grantham make extremely believable and sympathetic victims, though the real acting honours go to the villains. Hess (who also composed the film's dated but often effective score) is truly remarkable in his role, making Krug into one of the most unforgettable screen psychopaths, and he is almost matched by veteran porn director Lincoln's surprisingly effective turn as Weasel, presenting him as a humorous, laid-back character that is capable of shocking, cold-blooded violence. But while the film is often quite disturbing, it also has plenty of entertainment value. When the violence is not being displayed, the tone is very tongue-in-cheek, as Craven provides plenty of sharp dialogue and effective bits of black humour. In particular, the infamous scene where Weasel meets his painful revenge from Mari's mother, and the dynamite dream sequence that precedes it, manage to be both shocking and oddly entertaining at the same time. But it is the film's anti-violence statement that makes "Last House" so memorable, as Craven does not allow his characters to feel any satisfaction for their vicious actions. This is easily one of the ten most important horror films of all time, and a real personal favourite of mine. It demands to finally be recognized as the true groundbreaking achievement that it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit over-hyped, but fairly good and certainly important historically</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I think that people tend to get a bit hyperbolic when they talk about The Last House on the Left, I do think it's a fairly good film, especially given what the filmmakers were trying to do and considering their lack of experience, the era and the budget. Also, despite a filmic precursor, it just may be the earliest example of the horror subgenre of "brutal, realist tragedy" (that's more a description than a name, but I haven't spent much time trying to come up with a catchy moniker). However, it has flaws that would be difficult to overlook in a "distanced" (rather than "objective" or "unbiased", neither of which I think are possible) assessment of the film.The story, although claimed as true, is an adaptation of Ingmar Bergman's Jungfrukällan (aka The Virgin Spring, 1960). Roughly, it is the story of Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel). We see Mari at home with her almost-hip parents. Mari is about to head out to a "Bloodlust" concert in New York City with her new friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham). Mom and dad are harassing her about her clothing, which is thin enough to show off a bit of flesh, but they're not so un-hip as to make her change. Meanwhile, we learn from a radio that four convicts--"murderers, dope-pushers and rapists"--have just escaped from prison. At the same time, director Wes Craven slowly reveals the quartet--Krug Stillo (David A. Hess), Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler), Fred "Weasel" Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain). They're holed up in a New York City apartment. Sadie seems to be group property, and that causes some tension. It is suggested that they look for a couple more women. Mari and Phyllis end up at the wrong place at the wrong time. They're kidnapped, and mayhem ensues. But there's a twist that arrives when the convict's car breaks down in an ironic location."Frightening", "disturbing", "sick" and various other terms are frequently employed when describing Last House on the Left. Since I find no films scary, I can't vouch for the first term, but the other two would perhaps apply proportionate to how many horror films you regularly watch, and just what kinds of horror films. If you're not used to the genre in its grittier and gorier post-1960s instantiations, you'd likely find The Last House on the Left shocking. If you've seen a large number of films such as The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Cannibal Holocaust (1980), Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer (1986) and so on, don't pay too much attention to the hype. You're not likely to be very disturbed by anything you see here.That doesn't mean that you'll not enjoy this film. After all, it has been a major influence on the films mentioned above--there is even an important chainsaw scene here. That's especially remarkable when we consider that it was only Craven and Producer Sean S. Cunningham's second film. They had been approached by a consortium of exhibitors who said that they wanted "something as appalling and exploitable as Night of the Living Dead (1968)".Maybe largely by accident, Craven and Cunningham (along with others, such as assistant producer Steve Miner, who later became much bigger "names" in horror--between these three, we have the helmers of a number of films in the three major 1980s/1990s franchises--Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street) happened upon an unusual cinema vérité style that made the horrific situations depicted seem much more immediate and real. Combined with occasionally graphic and always intense situations of violence and control, the final effect is akin to watching a home video/snuff film. In fact, it was promoted as such in some areas, and the effect was disturbing enough in its time that the film initially received an X rating and was banned for many years in some locales.But again, focusing on that amounts to hype now, and shouldn't be taken too seriously, lest it lead to inflated expectations. Just as surprising on a first viewing is that The Last House on the Left has an intermittent goofy sense of humor and a "groovy" attitude that is firmly mired in the early 1970s. The two policemen are really comic relief characters (and very funny at that), but there is also a lot of humor surrounding the criminal quartet--this almost becomes a "black comedy" at times. These sensibilities even extend to the music, which has a frequent hillbilly edge and lyrics that supply ex-positional material. Surprisingly, Hess, who plays Krug, wrote the music.Despite the simplicity of the story and the fact that the 2002 MGM DVD release is the "most complete cut ever" according to Craven, there are problems with the story, whether due to the script or the editing. Too many segues between major plot points are "jumpy". The chase(s) through the woods seems a bit random. It's not very well explained how the convicts end up at a home looking as they do. Two characters find another who was missing, and it seems more like a dream sequence because of its arbitrariness, and so on.But overall, the story is effective enough. Although many subtexts can and have been read into the film, the most interesting theme to me was that it's largely a "tragedy of happenstance". Craven seems to be expressing a strong belief in chance and coincidence and focusing on the dark side of it. Under that reading, we can maybe excuse some of the narrative jumps more easily.Although there are a number of similar films that I think are better than The Last House on the Left, including Ruggero Deodato's House at the Edge of the Park (aka La Casa sperduta nel parco, 1980)--also starring Hess in a similar role, curiously enough, this is a must-see for serious horror fans because of its historical importance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Haunting movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw Last House on the Left at the age of 18 at the drive in with my best girlfriend. This movie, an early outing by horror maven Wes Craven was so disturbing to me that 26 years later I am still haunted by the images on the screen. The story, of 2 young girls, approximately the same age I was when I saw the film, of being abducted, tortured, raped and then murdered is not for the faint of heart. The brutality and violence was staggering, and the film spoke volumes of the depravity of the human soul. I remember driving home with my girlfriend after watching this, and both of us were dead silent, each contemplating what we had watched and knowing that something like that could happen to us. This movie is one I know without a doubt, that I will never again watch, and now, being the parent of a daughter myself, I could never watch it and then allow her out of the house again. This is not a monster movie, the MONSTERS are human and all too real, especially in today's society filled with Ted Bundy's and The Green River Killer, this movie hits too close to home and leaves the viewer depressed and saddened at what human beings are capable of doing to other innocent people. Watch it if you dare, but be prepared to be left with a very hollow feeling after it is over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"And the road leads to nowhere..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whether you love it or hate it (there really seems to be no in-between), you must admit that Last House on the Left is a powerful film. In my opinion, it may be one of the most important American films ever made. Screw Scream--this is Wes Craven's best. Combining professional and amateurish elements on a low budget, it has the scratchy, over-saturated look of a perverse home movie--and the rough edges make it all the more unforgettable. The actors are very good, especially David A. Hess in his definitive role as sadistic sex murderer Krug and Jeramie Rain as a deranged woman obviously modeled after Sadie Glutz. The brutal rape-murders and scenes of vengeance are staged in a chilling, claustrophobic manner that makes you feel like you're there. Oddly enough, the clash of light (the comically inept cops, the cheery soundtrack) and dark elements creates a juxtaposition that's even more disturbing; despite what's happening, the three nuts are enjoying themselves without remorse and the rest of the world just bounces along obliviously. Also, the cop scenes often provide a necessary break from the brutality, giving you a brief second to breathe before plunging you back in. A tone of grim tension is maintained throughout, and it clings to you long after you've left the Last House. How, you ask, could a person enjoy something like this? Because it does what a horror movie is ultimately supposed to do, and I know that in the end, "It's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And the road leads to nowhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much as I admire it, I can only watch Wes Craven's brilliant debut feature once every few years; as sheer stomach-churning brutality goes, it makes SALO look like Sondheim. Craven has said he made the movie as extreme as it is as his comment on the obscenity of Vietnam. I've heard that number many a time (Ruggero Deodato blames CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST on the Red Brigade!), but in Craven's case, it's so palpable it's believable. LAST HOUSE may be the first (and is certainly the most far-out) case of a horror movie that eschews suspense, tingles, shock, in the wake of sheer, harrowing barbarism.Based on Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, it tells the tale of a couple of young girls on their way to a concert who fall prey to a Manson-like family. Their rape-murders are avenged by a suddenly wised-up couple of parents who, in their restitution, find themselves as blood-bespattered and guilty as their prey.LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is a grindhouse GUERNICA, an outcry over desensitization to violence that leaves you feeling shaken and desolated. It genuinely reupholsters the word "horror." For most, the clarity of Craven's intentions won't be enough to redeem the dire viciousness of what the director puts you through. For me, the ferocity of the movie has a cleansing, Artaudian pureness.One question: Craven made this film and his masterpiece, THE HILLS HAVE EYES, the ultimate statement on the nuclear family in post-Woodstock, post-Altamont America. He then went on to make a load of occasionally mildly amusing but mostly godawful movies. What's the story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How did Wes Craven go from this to the Nightmare on Elm Street comedies??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Last House on the Left having only recently gone back and watched The Texas Chainsaw Massacre again and learning that I simply don't enjoy abrasive horror films like that. They are extremely well-made and very effective, but they are effective to the point that I don't find them all that fun to watch, the way I enjoy watching even the campiest scary movies. I also realized that there is a much more distinct line between horror movies and scary movies than I had previously realized. Horror movies, like Texas Chainsaw and Last House on the Left, are not scary, they're horrible. Conversely, scary movies hopefully are actually scary (although all too often they're not either), but are rarely horrible, mostly because excesses of gore and whatnot often render them campy, separating them from reality and allowing you to laugh while someone is being brutally killed.Last House on the Left is a horror movie, not a scary movie. It is not scary for a second, but the fact that it is presented in this almost documentary-like way and involves very realistic characters make it that much more effective. Given that I was so recently sickened once again by Texas Chainsaw, I was expecting something equally abrasive from Last House on the Left, which I decided to see after seeing an excellent documentary about horror film history called The American Nightmare.The movie was clearly a groundbreaking film at the time of its release, and you can clearly see throughout the film scenes that were influential to popular horror films that have come out over the years. I was reminded of some cheesy backwoods movies that also came out in the 1970s, like 'Gator Bait and the disturbing I Spit on Your Grave, which both have a similar feel to Last House on the Left, but oddly do not have nearly the effect of novice director Wes Craven's early film. I have a feeling that this may be because Craven had significantly less goofy caricatures in his movie than either of the 'Gator Bait films or I Spit on Your Grave, both of which are hugely overshadowed by Last House on the Left, which in turn was eclipsed by the classic Deliverance the same year. In watching the interviews with Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham on the DVD, it is clear that the movie turned out to be a lot more than they had expected it to, mostly because it was so disturbing that there were people who didn't want either of them to ever be allowed to work in film again, and it's not hard to see why they were so upset. More than 30 years later, the film remains effectively disturbing and upsetting, simply because it portrays real people doing horrible things to other real people. There are simple situations in the movie where you may find yourself wide-eyed with shock at something that could easily be created by a few people with a home video camera. The success with which Craven and Cunningham were able to make such an effective film with little to no budget ranks Last House on the Left with other low budget classics like Texas Chainsaw and Night of the Living Dead, although it now retains considerably less notoriety, possibly because of the lack of a whole line of sequels.I have to say that I really enjoyed the police officers in the movie, a sheriff and his deputy whose jaw-dropping stupidity surpasses even that of all of the law enforcement in First Blood. The campy gestures like the sheriff slapping his forehead and rubbing his chin helplessly at his inability to commandeer a chicken farmer's truck when their own car ran out of gas, gosh darn it. The comic relief is unusually starkly contrast with the rest of the movie, but it's a good thing it's there, otherwise the movie would be even more difficult to watch. While it's true that it is an uncomfortable experience watching the movie and I've recently decided I don't enjoy things like that, you have to respect the skill with which it was put together. Not just the level of depravity that Craven and Cunningham managed to reach, but the way they were able to come up with ways to put the film together when they had such limited resources. From a technical standpoint, the movie is a huge success because of that. Not quite as much fun as some of his later movies (and not quite as bad as some of his later movies), but Last House on the Left performs some things that remain almost unheard of in the movies, especially horror movies, such as the fact that it contains full frontal nudity and extensive and brutal violence, but glorifies neither. The simple fact that this movie can be as graphic as it is without being exploitative is enough to show that even after three decades there is still something to be learned from it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Repugnant, unwatchable film leaves viewers with bad taste in their mouths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a fair number of movies with unpleasant subject matter and repellent characters, but I have never despised any film as much as this one. I think it may be a perverse testament to its impact that even reminding myself " it's only a movie" doesn't help. I've read all the arguments in its favor and seen a TV interview with Wes Craven talking about the impact of the Vietnam war on his direction, and I still cannot think of one positive thing to say about it. I saw it once a few years ago and will never see it again. Even the equally vile I Spit On Your Grave wasn't as disturbing as this. For me, there is not one redeeming feature about this movie...zero. I'm sorry I ever saw it and can only say in conclusion that sometimes sheer curiosity about a movie isn't enough to justify subjecting yourself to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitive Non-Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was one of the first in a very long tradition of exploitive films that were labeled as horror but weren't. This film is not particularly exploitive (at least when compared to later examples of the genre), but it isn't scary either. I'm not a huge fan of horror, but this fails as a film for any genre (or none).-POSSIBLE SPOILERS-This really doesn't even pretend to be a horror film. It's a very dated tragedy/drama about two girls who are kidnapped, abused, and murdered by a group of criminals who are eventually murdered by the parents of the victims.-END SPOILERS-Throughout the film, there are no shocks, no creepy music or photography, nothing even resembling horror. What the viewer gets instead is nudity, blood, sadism, dismemberment, violence, and a soundtrack composed entirely of really bad folkish 70s songs. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was cheaply made, so it's lacking in the technical aspects and does no wonders in the artistic ones.It was based on THE VIRGIN SPRING by Ingmar Bergman, which I haven't seen, but it's got to be better than this. This is a drama about senseless murder that isn't character oriented enough to justify its approach and is simply too exploitive to be taken seriously. The conclusion is gory stuff, but it isn't enough to turn this into the "horror classic" it's been hailed as.I don't know how Wes Craven ever managed to have a career after this. A semi-sequel called THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK was made six years later with one of the same actors and is actually slightly better than this. If you want to see an early Wes Craven film, THE HILLS HAVE EYES is better than this (don't expect THE GODFATHER, though). If you want good horror, don't see this. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is no more than a weepy video-nasty with a bad score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember, quite vividly, the ad campaign for "Last House on the Left". I clearly remember the eerie feeling I got when I saw the ads, either televised or printed. Yet, as eerie as they were, nothing in the ads ever prepared me for this movie. I felt helpless during the film because nothing I could do would help the characters on-screen. I was terrified by man's cruelty to man. I still continue to be haunted by this film. The feeling one experiences viewing this film can only be compared to what a jury feels when video evidence is presented. With that said, I have to admit this is a great film. To evoke such feelings in an audience using actors and actresses is a work of great talent. I can't say I've enjoyed most of Mr. Craven's works; but, this is undeniable a staple in cinema's history.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A landmark horror film which is still as powerful and disturbing as ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Last House On The Left' is easily Wes Craven's most important movie. It was one of the most notorious movies of the early 70s but seems to be half forgotten now, despite being a groundbreaking horror film that opened up territory that had previously not been seen on screen. Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' deserves some acknowledgement as being the most realistic horror movie up until that point (the late 60s), but even that had a supernatural element, something 'Last House On The Left' eschews. Craven took the contemporary setting and natural performances of NOTLD and added some graphic violence and a confrontational rape sequence, most likely inspired by Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' released the previous year, and made it into something quite unlike anything seen before. This made it the father of all subsequent serial killer dramas. 'Last House...' is still a very nasty and disturbing movie thirty years after it was originally released. Craven was a beginning as a film maker and the budget was minimal, so the movie is rough and crudely made at times, but the best sequences have an almost documentary feel which gives it an appearance of realism that makes it sometimes really difficult to watch. The acting in the movie is variable. Mari's parents and the comic relief cops (who include Martin Kove later to appear in 'Death Race 2000' and countless action movies!) are pretty awful, but the two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) are both very natural and believable, and Craven REALLY lucked out with Krug and his gang who are all very, very good. Krug is played by David Hess, who also composed and sang the songs on the soundtrack, something which makes him pretty unique! Hess wrote Elvis' 'All Shook Up' and 'I Got Stung' and yet his performance as Krug is totally convincing. Krug is still one of the creepiest and most repellent killers ever seen on screen. Comedian Marc Sheffler gives an interesting performance as Krug's junkie son, Fred J. Lincoln (now a porno director I believe!) is excellent as the aptly named Weasel, and Jeramie Rain is surprisingly good as Sadie, who brings to mind some of Manson's girls. These four actors are outstanding and really help make the movie into an unforgettable experience. Their scenes in the woods with the girls are still as powerful and disturbing as ever. 'Last House On The Left' is hardly the kind of movie you "enjoy" but I think it's a very important movie, and still the best thing Wes Craven has been involved with. It's really quite difficult to believe that Craven made something so uncompromising and nasty as this! I highly recommend 'The Last House On The Left' to anybody interested in the development of horror, screen violence, or disturbing movies of any kind. But be warned, it is NOT easy viewing and may be difficult for many people to take. I think it is worth it as it's still an extraordinary piece of work!</fullReview>

Yes, straightforward depictions of violence against captive women, but done in amateurish fashion with unintentionally ridiculous actors. After the last victim is dispatched, the film disintegrates into absurd foolishness, reminiscent of an early Woody Allen film. Seems like it was done on a shoestring budget with only one shoestring. How Wes Craven found work after this debacle is beyond reason. It seems as if a few friends got together one Saturday with a video camera, had a few beers, had people in it who never acted before, and had a good time. Pure trash.</fullReview>

Now looking back, how this was included in a best of is beyond me. This has got to be one of the worst films of all time. It is so cheaply made and not in the least bit scary. I would not even categorize this as horror, it's so pathetically poor I was crying, should be in the violent comedy section at Blockbuster. To believe A Clockwork Orange came out a year before and this was all the creativity Wes Craven could come up with. The acting (if you can call it that) is non-existent, the effects are so laughable, the villains are stupid jerks who are not at all threatening, and why the hell is it even called TLHOTL? Looks like it was shot in someones back yard on a budget of six bucks. Halloween is everything this movie wanted to be and even that's very dated. Frighteningly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't understand why this film has received a cult reputation. It's like watching a homemade snuff film. The only good part was when the parents of one of the slain girls got their revenge on these bastards. Thankfully, Wes Craven would go on to direct better movies after this.It's interesting that Roger Ebert gave "Caligula" a no-star rating, but he gave this one three-and-a-half stars.This movie may not be as violent as "Caligula", but it's just as disturbing.The music score (and the songs) seem totally out of place, and the comedy bits with the two sherriffs don't help matters much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark Film Despite it's Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Landmark horror film about two teen girls killed by some brutes who later receive sterner justice by one of the girls parents. Dated with bad color, ill advised 'comic relief', and a jarring music score. It's really just the eight minutes in the woods where the girls are humiliated, tortured, raped, and murdered that make this movie standout. It reaches a certain level of starkness never seen before and in many ways rarely since. No teasers of cosmic revelations here. The girls, as in most true life crimes, are killed simply because they 'were in the wrong place at the wrong time'. The scene also allows for some interesting, multifaceted observations of the characters. The teens are typically rebelious, yet one reverts to a childhood prayer just before she is killed. The killers are savage and brutal. Yet when the crime is over look at the scene with a certain disgust and shame. The ending scene at the parents house, although done for metaphorical purposes, is redundant, overblown, and not as effective. Sure apple pie, suburban mom would be upset to meet her daughters killers, but would that be enough to do fellatio on a scummy stranger just as a way to kill him? Overall it's the scenes that work that give this film it's vintage stature. Actor Hess creates a incredibly viscious and intense villiain. Similar in tone to the excellent HENRY PORTRAIT OF A SERIAL KILLER.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a waste of time. It may have set standards when it was first shown, over 30 years ago, but it's no good for today. I had a very bad time seeing this movie, it made me want to cry, 'cause I realized that if i were born 30 years ago I could have been famous. It would only taken me to pick a couple friends, a camera and a big house, and tell them to act like sick retarded morons or whatsoever during 87 minutes. Then, a bunch of people would have loved it and turned it into a cult movie. Make that several times and you got yourself a career.This may contain spoilers ahead (if there's anything to spoil, though).The movie is about a couple slutties that went downtown for drugs and end up being kidnapped, raped and murdered. The guys that commit this atrocity will soon be held by their vengeanceful parents, who would slice cut and dice them in revenge. The end.?That's it? Yes, that's all of it. And don't think that there will be any gore, or suspense, or good dialogues, or anything to discuss about. The only thing that will be held in your mind is the absolutely awful and idiotic tag line repeated over and over "it's only a movie" ??What an horrible marketing this film had! Surely there is absolutely nothing good about this movie, so I better don't waste more time on reviewing it. Please, don't watch it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's Rape/Revenge "Classic"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I credit LAST HOUSE for being one of, if not THE first film to turn me on to a genre that has become near-and-dear to my heart - the Rape/Revenge film. Typically the story lines of these films have a woman (or in some cases more than one woman) who goes through some horrible rape experience, and either lives to take revenge on her assailant/assailants, or dies and is avenged by a friend, loved one, etc...These films tend to be brutal and realistic in their portrayal of rape and violence, and can usually securely be considered in the category of "exploitation" films.LAST HOUSE is about two young girls out for a night in the city. Along the way they go up to a guy and try to score some pot from him. To make it short, the "drug-dealers" (three guys and a girl) turn out to be escaped convicts. They abduct the girls and take them to the woods where they are then raped and eventually murdered after enduring some pretty strong humiliation. Unfortunately for the abductors, the woods where they took the girls are right by one of the victim's parent's house, and when the abductor's car breaks down and they go looking for some neighborly help - all hell breaks loose...There are definitely some inconsistencies and faults with LAST HOUSE - most notably the inclusion of some strangely out of place comedic moments - but as a whole, that factor doesn't really diminish the overall impact of the film. I also take into account the relative inexperience of Craven and crew during the production of the film. If I remember the commentary correctly, the film was commissioned as an "opener" for another film, and Craven and his cronies decided to make an off-the-wall horror film. Being that these types of strong exploitation-style films were just coming into being in the 70's and for the raw content that LAST HOUSE portrays - I feel this was a ballsy move on the filmmakers behalves.Highly recommended for any exploitation or rape/revenge buff - a definite must-see. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Shocking After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another reviewer (see Dan Grant, below) has already vividly described the effect of seeing this film for the first time. There is no doubt that Last House on the Left is one of the most affecting films I have ever seen. However, integrity demands I shave off a number of points simply because the film doesn't entirely overcome the obstacles presented by a very low budget and a callow director.I saw this exploitation flick while working the graveyard shift in a home for retarded adults. I'm not sure why I watched it all the way through since splatter movies are not my cup of tea -- maybe I was ready for a change from late-80s MTV or maybe something in the film itself held me, but for most of the time I was watching it, I was thinking: this is the worst film I've ever seen (hadn't yet seen Plan 9).Then, when the action came to its climax it hit me that this movie is actually a re-make of one of Ingmar Bergman's black-and white religious films. I was stunned! I found it hard to believe Craven had even seen any film before, let alone based one on a work by perhaps the greatest master of world cinema.But Last House stayed with me. Not a year goes by that some unbidden image doesn't pop into my head while I'm driving or trying to fall asleep. Wes Craven, despite having made this movie with little money and less experience, hit on some awful truth that for the longest time was nameless for me.Now, of course, I realize that the truth is simply one of Evil, American style. While Bergman spent perhaps three minutes total screen time on the violence in his narrative, with the rest of the movie involving the characters' inner landscapes, Craven spends MOST of the film on acts of violence (both physical and psychical, to quote Bergman) using them as windows into his characters' interiors.And the evil we see, especially that of the film's sociopaths, is pure.Yes, we know there are folks out there without a shred of mercy, who would do to us or our children the things done in the film, just for a lark. We read about them in the newspaper. But knowing something and seeing exactly what it would look like are two different things entirely.That is why I was wrong at first about this movie. More than any other film I've seen, this one brought home to me the vulnerability of my all-too-human flesh and civilized thought-patterns. I (and probably you) would be no match for the life-sized evil encountered in this film -- evil that's so much easier to believe in than the over-blown monsters Craven served up to us later.If you like horror flicks, don't miss this one. If you don't, check out the Bergman inspiration (look it up -- I promised no spoilers). Either way, you'll be hit with a truth you need to know about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitative trash masquerading as "social commentary".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A strong candidate for "The Worst Movie of All Time". With his first film Craven reached heights of ineptitude and tastelessness that even Craven-haters should be surprised by, and the incompetence is far-reaching; in every respect imaginable does this film not fail to fail. This piece of exploitative trash is at the very least the worst killers-on-the-lam film ever made. The acting ranges from one-dimensional to atrocious to ridiculous, and the characters behave in such an inconsistent and illogical manner that I have to suspect that this movie wasn't so much directed as that it's simply a collection of improvised scenes by a couple of bored ? and talentless - students who just happened to have had a camera nearby. One of the main things that separates a film like "I Spit On Your Grave" from this junk is that Craven has neither respect nor pity for victims of brutal crimes; this he shows more than obviously by playing utterly inappropriate cheerful music while the two girls are being shoved into the trunk of a car and then driven off. At the end of the film there is yet more upbeat music. This is not some fantasy zombie film where you can expect your audience to laugh with you about the exaggerated and silly events and cartoon violence that take place in the movie. The main events in this "reality-based" horror movie haven't got an iota of a humorous side to them, and the fact that Craven doesn't realize this shows what a sad little degenerate he is. An English professor??? What a joke. In-between scenes of torture, degradation, and murder Craven manages to squeeze in scenes of goofy cops, which we are supposed to find amusing.</fullReview>

But if you have even a rudimental sense of decency or humanity, it will be the most revolting film you'll see.Two girls are kidnapped, forced to do whatever pleases or amuses their kidnappers (in one case, a girl urinating through her bluejeans!?!). The girls are both viciously raped, shot, and left for dead in the woods. Furthermore the kidnappers somehow cross paths with one of the kidnapped girls parents and suffer ridiculous vigilante justice from the disgruntled parents.It's amazing that this film is even on DVD or VHS, or that Wes Craven ever got another movie contract! It's only purpose is to make people sick and to please a sadistic and warped audience. It is by far the worst film I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better left alone. (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last House on the Left is allegedly based on a true story about the brutal murder of two teenage girls by escaped convicts out in the boonies.Basically, this movie is two parts. The first are the scenes leading up to and including the rape, torture, and murder of the girls by the four convicts. Sitting through this and watching about an hour of two girls getting raped and beaten and stabbed and forced to perform humiliating acts was not my idea of entertainment. I'd never want to be in a situation like this, let alone want to watch it. Sure, there are certain things in horror movies, but this is more like Wes Craven's attempt at amateur snuff. All we watch is the act of the convicts eliminating the girls, who they've taken out into the woods somewhere. It's really disgusting, and nothing else happens. It's not even like a horror movie and it's really sick to sit through. What was the point of exploiting brutal murders like that for cheesy entertainment? If that weren't bad enough, the rest of the movie is just awful. I know, it's 1972, and Wes Craven was not yet in his prime (pre-Nightmare on Elm Street), but this is bad even by bad horror movie standards. For one thing, the disgusting scenes of the girl's rape and murders are somehow celebrated with happy folk music. When the attackers all gather around one of the girls, including a scene where one of the attackers starts pulling intestines from the girl's wounds, they finish and all stand around looking at each other while some weepy song plays with lyrics about being ostracized from the world. What the hell is that?Then, there's these interspersed scenes of these two stupid Keystone cop types who might've been able to intervene somehow, but ignored that suspicious looking car parked out by the road. The scenes with the two stupid cops are funny, and the music is like banjo work that accompanies old silent film slapstick comedy. Where were the filmmakers going with this? In one scene, we'll be watching a girl getting stabbed to death, and then the next scene is the two stupid cops running out of gas and having to hitch a ride on a chicken truck? Disgusting.The finale is when the four attackers get their just deserts. With no help from the bumbling policeman, the parents of one of the girls, invites the four strangers into their home, thinking they're stranded traveling businesspeople. However, they soon learn that these are the people that killed their teenage daughter. So Mr. and Mrs. Suburbanite setup their house (and their attackers) for revenge. The ending is so drawn out and so completely stupid, it's not even funny. This was really one completely worthless horror movie. What a waste of time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and I don't mean that in a joking, it is funny kind of way. This film has no redeeming quality. That is a sad thing to say, when you are talking about horror movies, there are tons of really bad ones that come to mind. This is still one of the worst... yikes. I was not going to comment on this movie, but after reading so many favorable reviews from other viewers on this site, I had to set the record straight. This movie is terrible! I mean this movie is bad! It does not deserve some hallowed place in the horror movie hall of fame. It deserves to sit on your local video store shelf, collecting dust. The tagline for this movie says to keep repeating, "it's only a movie, it's only a movie.." well guess what? It's not. It is just a big mess. It is an excuse to put some really poor special effects onto the screen. This film is not suspenseful, terrifying or stomach churning. This movie is mostly just boring. Not to mention a virtual clinic on how NOT to direct, edit, act in or score a film! Crazy banjo music during a ridiculous rape scene? WHAT!?! According to one song in the movie, the road leads to nowhere. Apparently, so does this movie. People like to say this movie paved the way for such classics as Halloween. I say that is ridiculous. Halloween used lighting, camera angles, music and story to create suspense and action. Last House on the Left misuses these same things to create NOTHING!!! A friend of mine and I usually rent two or more horror movies per week, in search of truly bad movies. We are working on a book rating all the horror movies we can get our hands on. As a result of this, we have found many movies that are bad, but some are still entertaining. Unfortunately, Last House on the Left is on par with such uninteresting drivel as The Howling: New Moon Rising, perhaps the worst movie ever made, regardless of genre. Wes Craven is a wildly erratic filmmaker who got lucky with Nightmare on Elm Street and the Scream movies. He has struggled and still put out some mildly entertaining movies such as Deadly Friend, but avoid Last House on the Left at all costs, as it is not only one of the worst Wes Craven films, but one of the worst horror films ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Mari Collingwood's 17th birthday. She and her friend Phyllis Stone go to NYC for a concert. They try to buy some weed but are kidnapped and raped by a gang of criminals. They are stuff in the car trunk and driven to the woods near Mari's home. The girls are tortured and killed. The gang ends up coincidentally at the Collingwood home while the bumbling local cops struggle to track the gang down.This is definitely an exploitation film. I'm sure it was derided by the critics at the time. Some of those exploitation parts are actually the best parts of the movie. Being forced to pee in her pants is a compelling scene. The rest of the movie is amateurish, silly and simply bad. The comic stuff with the cops is groan-worthy. The coincidence of running into the Collingwood home is ridiculous and unnecessary. The gang could have gotten the address from Mari. The overall need to create a peaceful happy tone while counteracting it with the brutal violence does not come off well. Then there is the killing of the girls which splits the movie in two. The second half fades and the intensity never fully recovers. It's one of Wes Craven's first and it's at the level of a good student film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like everything else in 1972, this film was politically charged - Spoilers below</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a love hate relationship with LHOTL (1972). In some ways, it is an iconic film on par with the Exorcist (1973) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) Oddly it's clear that Wes Craven was affected by the nascent feminism of the time. LHOTL works as polemic, because it makes the rapes seem at first titillating (bondage, lesbianism, etc.) and then excessively cruel. It plays on the sexism of the mostly hormonal demographic that watched grindhouse films.In the early 70s, everything had sociopolitical and cultural significance. Craven by amplifying the sexism, drugs, irresponsibility, anarchism, criminality (Manson family parallels in Krug Stillo's "family") and violence of the 1960s counterculture actually subverts the 60s. Clearly the Woodstock nation was a carcass by 1972 like Mari on her 17th birthday. The curse follows her peace necklace to Junior Stillo.The Exorcist (a critique of organized religion) and the Texas Chainsaw Massacre (a vegan polemic) are both better films, but LHOTL came first.Things to expect that may cause you to want to avoid LHOTL: 1) slow, drawn out, graphic rape, torture and mutilation of two young (as in jail bait) teen girls; 2) two disembowelments: one by hand; the other by chainsaw; 3)castration by mastication (the 1st in cinema); 4) the first horror film where someone is dispatched with a chainsaw. LHOTL is one of those experiences that you have to witness yourself in order to judge.Don't be surprised if just the first couple of scenes make you want to take a long shower with Lava soap and a scrub brush. Even the film stock is grimy. Apparently people in the 70s didn't bathe or wash their clothes much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good debut movie from Wes Craven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's interesting to see how Wes Craven's directing career first started off, with this movie. It's a true '70's exploitation flick, that shows that Craven already was pretty much at ease within the genre, even early on in his career. He handles the theme well, even though the movie also has some unbalanced elements in it.As far as exploitation flicks go this movie is a real great one within its genre. It has a pretty good look and feel over it, that is required for the genre. Despite its obviously low budget the movie really isn't cheap looking, at least not compared to most other similar genre movies I have seen. It features all of the right ingredients you could expect from a movie like this and it has a pretty simple but nevertheless fine and effective concept. It's a story that is far from likely but who cares really. In these sort of movies a story is more like a secondary thing and it's only purpose is to provide the movie with the usual exploitation movie ingredients.The movie though is a bit of an unbalanced mix when it comes down to it's different elements. On the one hand it's an exploitation movie with thriller/horror elements to it, while in the other the movie also tries to throw in some quirky humor, which doesn't really strengthen its more exploitation like elements. The movie just feels a bit too unbalanced at times.I doubt the remake, which will hit the cinemas next week, will work out as well because of the simple reason that this movie is a true '70's exploitation flick, a genre that is long time death now and today will only work out as ridicules with todays used techniques and usual standards.It's violence and torturing sequences are all being handled well, with true skill. It's one of the things that makes this movie better than most other exploitation flicks from the glorious '70's. Also it's second halve, that is pretty insane, is what makes this movie a great watch, especially if you are into the genre.A nice directorial debut from the then still pretty young Wes Craven.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this film to be rather interesting in a number of ways. Yes, I would agree that it has many unpleasantries throughout the film: two women are raped, stabbed, shot, and brutally killed, one man loses his manhood in a rather disconcerting fashion, and another man is chainsawed to bits. Yet, through all this, the film has many highlights when viewed as a product of its time and with regard to its importance to the horror genre. The film creates a disturbing atmosphere which really affects the viewer. The murders are cold-blooded and yet not glorified in any manner. The acting, although for the most part amateurish, is restrained and believable. A must see for any student of the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's masterpiece. **Spoilers**</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven began his career with this very disturbing and brutal horror movie.The plot is as follows:A gang of sadistic criminals led by Krug Stillo(David Hess)kidnap and rape two young girls Mari(Sandra Cassel)and Phyllis(Lucy Grantham).When the girls try to escape,the group hunts them down and kills them.In a strange twist of fate they end up staying at one of the girl's home with her parents-and are promptly murdered."Last House on the Left" is a pretty controversial movie.Obviously Craven didn't have a lot of money,so he shot this film with a shaky camera.That's why this movie looks like a documentary.It is hard to watch,because it features some grisly scenes of rape and violence.In my opinion,the most disturbing sequence is when Phyllis is brutally murdered.She is stabbed in the stomach and the killers cut off her hand.Another disgusting moment is when Krug rapes Mari and tortures her with a razor.The acting is great-the girls play innocent victims very well.The criminals-Krug,Weasel and Sadie-are some of the most believable villains in the history of the cinema.The fans of "Scream" or "Nightmare on Elm Street" or non-horror fans may not like this movie.However if you love watching powerful movies I'd strongly recommend you to see this one.Just beware:"Last House on the Left" was banned in several countries(including England)and it's really tough to find.Try to find also "The New House On The Left"(1978)-an unofficial sequel to this one.</fullReview>

It left a bad taste in my mouth, and was the beginning of my dislike to the trash I now refer to as rape/torture movies. I can't say anything about the characters, mainly I don't remember them very well.

		<fullReview>What a truly awful film. This film is exploitative and trashy to say the least! The graphic rape and torture scenes are unnecessary and hard to watch. Bad acting, awful script, and terrible cinematography also plague this "film". Several times I thought of just turning the tape off, but no matter how bad a film is, I watch the end. The revenge scene at the end was ok but a little unrealistic. Seriously, if someone had murdered your daughter, wouldnt you kill him in a horrible way instead of performing fellatio on him and biting it?!? I wouldnt want to give him one moment of pleasure for all the pain he caused Mari! Why is it that too many young male directors have brutal rape scenes and fellatio in their films which are totally unnecessary? This "film" is a disgusting waste of film and time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>WORST. MOVIE. EVER.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>********Possible Spoilers Ahead***************This has got to be the worst movie I've ever seen. Where to start? How about that totally inappropriate hillbilly "getaway" music while the escaped convicts throw the 2 girls into their trunk and drive away?But maybe I'm getting ahead of myself. Plot summary: 2 girls are on their way to a concert (but really take their sweet time getting there; they frolic in the woods, get ice cream, search around for some marijuana, etc...). It just so happens that they bumble themselves right into a den of escaped cons while looking to score some weed. Surprisingly, the cons rape, torture and murder them (but really take their sweet time about it). Meanwhile one of the girl's parents are like, "Hmm, shouldn't our daughter be home by now?" and they call the cops, who sit casually in their living room eating cake. The cops eventually begin to look for the girls; however, their car breaks down and they try to hitch with several different motorists. The cons, meanwhile, have wound up (unknowingly) at the dead girl's parents house! The parents still know nothing about what has happened, so they allow them to stay the night. When the parents find out exactly who these people are and what they have done to their daughter, they (guess what?) torture and murder the cons, in an hilarious example of poetic justice. This movie is more like a failed attempt at a comedy of errors than a serious horror film. Unbelievable. Unbearable. 1 of 5 stars, but only because I got a couple of chuckles out of the scene where the cops try to hitch rides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the first mistake I made was not reading past the first page of comments on here. What rave reviews... dark and chilling... cult classic... seminal masterpiece... etc.Utter nonsense! This film is just plain bad. Hammer House of Horror movies are better made, scarier, better acted, better script, better score.The genre, I suppose, is rape-revenge, but the manner in which it is executed is laughable and Wes Craven obviously had no idea how to make the bad guys menacing or how to create empathy for the victims. The "comedy" moments - ah yes - clever juxtaposition? No. Just clueless film-making.OK - what about the famous rape scene? The scene that makes this film so well respected. The scene that redeems the remaining amateurish nonsense? Well, OK, the girl in question doesn't look exactly pleased I admit. However, the "remorse" shown by the perpetrators is ham acting at its worst, but even then not so bad as most of the acting (and direction) in the film. One 10-second scene does NOT redeem this film is any way.I can't believe I bought this (albeit just 5 pounds). I've seen some dross in my time but this is Top-Ten garbage. Certainly not in the "so bad it's good" category.Plan 9 from Outer Space is much much better.You have been warned.... a total waste of time and money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a horrible film and not because of the subject matter. "I Spit on Your Grave" (1978), a film with a similar theme and settings, is far, far superior to this trash. The acting is embarrassingly bad. The script is illogical and stupid. The characters are one-dimensional caricatures. The cinematography is grainy and soft. The music is cheesy. The direction is obviously the work of a hack. The overuse of closeups is annoying. Craven repeatedly pans the camera to something totally irrelevant to the plot. It looks like the budget for this film was about $1.98 and that some of that money was returned to the producer. Some films are trashy but enjoyable. This isn't one of them.</fullReview>

Seriously, the packed theater was roaring with laughter at the horrible acting, lousy screenplay and obvious violence. The show became a word-by-mouth cult film ala Night of The living Dead, and I must have seen this " trip down trash lane" about a dozen times. Shocking? You've got to be kidding!

		<shortDescription>A rough classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone reading this knows how much of an impact Wes Craven had on the world of horror. He was a legend, spawning not one but two genre icons in the form of Freddy Krueger and Ghostface. But many years before he terrified mainstream audiences, he hit it big with a nasty little piece of work known as Last House on the Left. This was Craven's first film, and was a collaboration with Sean S. Cunningham - the man who went on to create the Friday The 13th franchise.Made in a time when cinema was breaking all sorts of boundaries, Last House was originally intended as a hardcore film. During early production, Craven and Cunningham came to believe the project would be able to stand on its own legs without needing the support of adult cinemas, and they toned down its content before they began filming.While they may have toned down the sexual content, they certainly didn't shy away from nasty torturous violence. Many films lose their shock value over time as standards shift and audiences become more jaded. This phenomenon doesn't affect Last House at all. It's still just as grimy and unpleasant as it was back on release. The old adage applies here: they just don't make 'em like they used to.The film as a whole is amateurish, but there are shining moments of real terror here, and that's why it's had such a lasting effect and influence on everything that followed in its footsteps. The grainy film stock and cinéma vérité style lend to the filthy atmosphere in a way that slick, modern digital simply can't replicate. David Hess is excellent as Krug. Chillingly cold and intimidating. His cohorts played by Fred Lincoln and Jeramie Rain are equally unsettling, and their performances are good enough to make us forget they're not actual sadist criminals. But even with all of that praise, it's hard to call it genuinely "good". It wasn't exactly made with noble intentions. It's an exploitation film, and not a fantastically well made one. It has many of the same drawbacks as other low budget movies of the time. The writing isn't particularly good, and there's a completely out of place subplot featuring bumbling cops that could have been transplanted from a goofball comedy. The bizarre folk-ish music (written and performed by David Hess) is odd and distracting, even though it's certainly unique and is part of its time. It just doesn't gel with the film's brutality.It doesn't really feel fair to criticize it on its technical merits. It is what it is, and its modern day audience will appreciate it for that. If nothing else, Last House on The Left can be thanked for introducing the world to both Craven and Cunningham - men who went on to essentially run the slasher genre throughout the 1980s alongside fellow horror alumnus John Carpenter. It's an incredibly important classic, but it's a rough one in every single way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've heard quite a bit about Wes Craven's 1972 debut film "Last House on the Left" over the years and finally decided to see what the hoopla was all about.PLOT (***Spoilers***): "Last House" is a simple rape/murder/revenge horror flick about two Connecticut girls who go to the big city to catch a rock concert, but they look for pot in the wrong place and end up kidnapped, humiliated, tortured, raped and killed. When the father &amp; mother of one of the victims find out they set out to take revenge; the culprits aren't hard to find 'cause they're, coincidently, overnight guests in their house! This is, apparently, a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman's "Virgin Spring" (1960), albeit in a modern America setting.WHAT WORKS: Aside from the brief Manhattan scenes, the woodsy Connecticut locations are great (Westport &amp; Redding); the three female actors are cute; and the diversified score (by the actor playing Krug) is entertaining even while a lot of it is incongruous with the material. In addition, the film can be appreciated as an early 70s period piece/oddity or if you're a Craven fan.Also, if you're a gorehound there's some significant gore, in particular a bloody disembowelment sequence.WHAT DOESN'T WORK: Wow, this story is really DUMB. I'm not referring to just the goofy aspects, i.e. the two rural policemen, but to the complete implausibility of the storyline: ***SPOILER ALERT*** The criminal gang just so happens to break down right in front of the rural house of one of the victims? Why sure! But there's more, way more: After breaking down on some desolate country road the gang decides to take a frolic in the woods where they torment, rape &amp; murder the girls; their clothes are completely bloody but they're able to fully wash up in a scummy pond and deck themselves to the hilt. Where'd they get the soap and towels, etc.? (I didn't see any) Where'd they get the nice dress clothes? Didn't they just escape from prison? Then they knock on the door of the closest house, the house of one of the victims (which they don't realize yet), and her parents cluelessly allow this suspicious foursome to stay overnight, a couple of 'em in their daughters very room -- unbelievable! Keep in mind that their daughter has been missing since the night before and they should be seriously concerned about that, but they're okay enough to allow four weirdo adult strangers to occupy their home -- Why sure! The revenge of the parents is just as ridiculous ***END SPOILER***. As noted above, many of these scenes are combined with an unfitting goofy score, which makes them all the more absurd. Really, the story is so ridiculous it's as if a 13 year-old came up with the plot but, no, it was written/directed by Wes Craven, a full-fledged adult with degrees in writing &amp; psychology -- unbelievable.With this understanding, how can the viewer possibly take the story serious? Which is why I find it strange that some people call this "the most disturbing film ever made," etc. If the material is absurd it can't truly be disturbing because it can't be taken seriously. Is the violence in the Road Runner disturbing? No. Why? Because it's a cartoon and it's preposterous. "Last House" may not be a cartoon but it's the same principle because it's just as preposterous.The reason 1978's "I Spit On Your Grave" works, for what it is, is because it's presented to the viewer in a serious, realistic manner (well, except for parts of the revenge scenes in the last 20 minutes -- but even those sequences are believable compared to the inanities of "Last House"). Consequently, "I Spit On Your Grave" is disturbing, "Last House" is not.One may defend the film on the grounds that it was the first of its kind as far as gore goes. I don't think so. "Night of the Living Dead" came out four years earlier and has more gore, albeit in black &amp; white. "Night" is a thousand times more disturbing and horrifying because, again, it takes the material serious.Some may object to how sick &amp; sadistic the criminal scumbags are, but they're supposed to be appalling because this is a rape/murder/revenge horror flick. It comes with the territory.BOTTOM LINE: I generously give "Last House" 2/10 for the positive elements noted above but, really, this is one of the dumbest flicks I've ever seen. I find it hard to believe it ever got a green light. You gotta see it to believe it, meaning it's definitely worthwhile as an early 70s curiosity.The film runs 84 minutes and the original cut 91 minutes.GRADE: D-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The cheesiest horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My first review on this site, so please be patient... First off I respect the movie for what it is, and what it has inspired. BUT I'm sorry but it is not scary. It is a bad comedy with some uncomfortable scenes. The characters are great, the music is at some point appropriate, but over all it has no jumps or bumps or any quality that so ever that is scary. I know a lot of people on here will use the age factor to diminish my opinions. BUT it is no ten star movie. I gave it a five out of ten because it is a classic and I loved the scene when the villains stop and think about what they have done. You can almost see that they actually feel sorry for what they did. That was what made the movie.It is a must see for people like me that are movie enthusiasts, but don't expect to be scared. I did enjoy the remake much more, but of course it wasn't perfect. Take it for what it is; a cheesy 70's flick. Enjoy the ride but expect nothing.</fullReview>

I don't think the film could decide whether it was trying for slapstick comedy or horror - well, neither one worked. Silly two dimensional characters don't really add much to the project either.With cheesy music and staged scenes, the only thing really horrific about the film was the acting!!!

		<fullReview>Disappointing, very disappointing! After watching the 2009's remake I was very curious about the original THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT because I found the remake a very good film with a very credible plot, nicely built characters and most of all I found the movie pretty realistic. Well, here, I guess it's all on the opposite side! This movie is totally unbelievable, on a bad way! I know it's a very dated production and we can't compare the way movies are produced nowadays to 1972's productions. Of course it's pretty different. But I'm giving it some discount on that way! I mean I scored this film 5/10 just because of that, because if it was a nowadays production with such cheapness I wouldn't score it higher than 1/10, that's for sure!!! Unlike the 2009's remake which have a solid plot, with a very credible development, that made me think: "What the Hell! That could happen in the real life", and all the characters were pretty realistic and well built to their "function" in the movie, here nothing of that happens! The plot developments are hardly justified, some characters look funny when they should be rude and scary (I'm talking about the thieves, of course!), the screenplay is unbelievably cheesy, with some terrible lines; I mean the only justification to that is if Wes Craven wanted to do a disturbing and funny movie at the same time!!! If not, why the thieves look so pathetic and no frightening at all; why the policemen look so dumb either (with that little music piece that looked so close to the DUKES OF HAZZARD music ? I know this movie is previous to that series, but you know what I mean...) and why all those cheesy lines in the screenplay?! It's an "Hippie-horror" that's the only explanation I can find! That was the only feature I can say I appreciated in this film, the hippie "background" of the plot. I mean maybe at the time nobody noticed because it was normal to that age, but today, watching it almost 40 years later, it tastes good that hippie stuff!:) The scene (at the beginning) when MARI is arguing with her mother about her bra, or the band she would see at the concert that killed a live chicken on stage, not to mention SADIE that also seemed to be a convicted feminist! LOL! It was funny to watch all those stuff, proper at the time, in a movie. Not to mention the music, which was very nice too; not appropriated to a supposedly disturbing movie, but very nice! Well, in fact, aside from that, I was very disappointed with this film because I was expecting something much better, especially after watching the remake. I saw many people telling that the remake was better (and that isn't so common to happen?) but I never thought it would be such a difference! The remake is really too much better than the original in all possible ways. Not because it's a more recent movie and have a better production (of course!), but essentially because it's pretty more realistic! Wes Craven, I must say it: the beginning of your career was not as brilliant as I thought! I score it 5/10 taking in consideration it's a dated production, otherwise it would be 1/10 as I said before?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last House on the Left Old and New</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a long time now I've been wondering what has happened to independent film? Where had the guts in the industry gone? Why weren't there terrific films like, "Reservoir Dogs," "Sling Blade," and edge of your seat horror, like the first "Halloween" being produced anymore? Then I happened to see the new version of "Last House on the Left" and I think I might have part of my answer. The new version of the film is certainly entertaining and in many ways vastly superior to the earlier version of "Last House on the Left," which was Wes Craven's first film. The new version has better actors, a more logical and realistic story line, and every element of the film looks great.What it lacks is the gritty realism of the original film. The 1972 version of "The Last House on the Left" meanders through its story telling. In the original version Mari Collingwood leaves her parents, John and Estelle, at their lake house to attend a concert with her friend Phyllis in New York. In the city the girls get abducted by Krug Stillo and his gang of rapists, murderers and drug addicts. Krug recently escaped from prison where he was incarcerated for murdering a priest and a nun - yep, a priest and a nun.Phyllis is raped, but remains resourceful and defiant. She also does her best to protect her more naive friend Mari and tries to engineer their escape. Phyllis' defiance awakens Krug's sadistic tendencies and the girls are forced to perform humiliating acts for the pleasure of their abductors.In a last attempt to escape Phyllis is murdered. In a surprisingly heartbreaking scene Krug also rapes and murders Mari. It's so sad that even Krug seems to momentarily feel the horror of what he's done.Then, lo and behold, Krug and gang end up at Mari's parents' home. The parents eventually discover their daughter's dead body and ascertain that Krug and his friends are responsible. From that point on it's a guessing game - will Mari's parents be able to seek revenge for their daughter's brutal murder - or will they become victims of Krug themselves? In one of the film's more memorable scenes Mari's mother bites off Freddie's...ahhh...protuberance.Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left" has major problems with logic, storyline, acting and editing - it's violent, exploitative, and yet it packs a visceral punch that the newer version of the film can't touch.In the modern incarnation of the "Last House on the Left" most of the sexual violence has been removed from the film. While the basic outline of the story remains the same - in the remake of the film a feistier Mari Collingwood survives the brutality that Krug has inflicted on her.The bad guys still show up at the Collingwood's home and once the Collingwood's discover their wounded and raped daughter carnage creepily ensues - although no one's schlong gets bitten off. It's a well-crafted and well-acted watered down version of the original film. It's a kinder and gentler "Last House on the Left." It's what horror films in America are threatening to become - moments of extreme violence, punctuating films whose characters become harder and harder to care about.Watching the remake of "Last House on the Left" was an illuminating experience. The creators of the new version of the film made the bet that their audience no longer wanted the raw exploitative experience of the original story. They decided to largely remove the sexual component and the heroism of Mari Collingwood's friend Phyllis. The perversions of the earlier film were hard to watch, mostly because the character of Phyllis was so brave, and that bravery made us care about the girls in a way the new film does not.The newer version of the film created a story where less is at risk because the two victims are only victims. The Phyllis character (now named Paige) is no longer resourceful or heroic. We don't feel who the Mari character is in the way we do in the 1972 version. In the newer version Krug and his gang are angrier too, and not having nearly as much fun being bad as the characters did in the older film. All of which leaves the audience very little stake in the film.If independent film, and independent horror are going to survive, filmmakers have to have the courage to offer something to compete with the unending parade of sequels, and tired Hollywood films where modern horror has more to do with loosing your life, and less to do with loosing your soul.Personally I like the idea of going back to what made horror great, which was coming up with new and interesting ideas in the first place. I also like the modern throwbacks of the genre: "Red Canyon," "Hard Candy," and "The Devil's Rejects." So maybe future of independent horror should look to the spirit of the past greats and let it inspire us to become truly innovative, not simply a carbon copy of a thousand other films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two teenage gals, newly friends, are on their way to a rock concert when they desire to score some reefer and wind up in the throes of terror when the supplier, Junior(Marc Sheffler) is actually the junkie son of an recently escaped psycho from prison, Krug(David Hess)who are holing up in a shoddy apartment with another sicko Weasel(Fred J Lincoln)and their nutso girlfriend Sadie(Jeramie Rain). After having their way with Phyllis(Lucy Grantham), the street gal, as her virginal friend Mari(Sandra Cassel)looks on in horror, the psychopathic four toss them in their car trunk the next day, hitting the road for Canada when the vehicle runs out of gas. The kicker is that the car runs out of gas just nearby Mari's home, yet neither girl can cry out. Into the wilderness the girls are forced into committing humiliating acts or else suffer the consequences. Yet, even after being run through the ringer(..Phyllis forced by Krug to pee in her pants, the two having to commit lesbian acts, both girls stripping, etc), their lives are still jeopardy as Phyllis attempts to escape as Mari, having been cut by Weasel earlier, suffers mental anguish hoping to coerce Junior into letting her go as the others run after the other. When the escapes fail, the four will finish them off and clean up, finding themselves at the home of Mari's parents. When Mari's father and mother(Richard Towers &amp; Cynthia Carr)find that these cretins, who they have allowed rooms to sleep for the night, have murdered their baby girl, revenge is on the menu.Getting past the brouhaha of how unpleasant and disturbing it is, I'll skip to the moments that effected me. The way Weasel moves his knife up and down his nose just itching to stick it in someone. How quietly intense and homicidal Hess is as Krug..bulking and tough, his menacing features are even more fearsome because of his brooding nature. Jearmie Rain, out of the four killers, is the most over-the-top and demented, loudly applauding her men's cruel and violent behavior, relishing their graphic acts on these two girls. Marc Sheffler's ugly features work well with such a pathetic character, who never had a chance in life considering who his father is. He's as much a victim as Mari and Phyllis. I actually thought Lincoln, as the no-nonsense killer Weasel(..always seen with his knife as if it were an extension of his pecker, taking good care of it), is about as good as Krug. He just doesn't care about anything, except the knife and getting to use it and having no sense of morality or conscience makes him almost as much a monster as Krug. I think Craven achieves what he sets out for with these sick bastards..if you are caught alone with these people, vulnerable, you have little chance of surviving because they have no boundaries holding them, no reason or guilt. I can see the film's influence on modern horror particularly in the photography as the camera often shoots characters from odd angles, sometimes capturing one or more actors on screen close-up or just a few feet away. The wilderness murders I found especially effective, although a lot of the violence is hinted instead of fully elaborated on. I think the film's in-your-face camera directing into the faces of the psychos works quite well as they inflict harm to the girls, with their faces showing the trauma occurring to them both physically and emotionally. When someone tosses the word "raw" out there, I think it's quite appropriate for Craven's film here. There's no cinematic polish in store for a viewer watching this for the first time. I think the film is simple in story, with the shocking violence doing the most work in leaving the lasting impression. Almost like a true crime story of what a group of serial killers do to victims in the wrong place at the wrong time with fate dealing them a bad hand, LHotL works from a very terrifying level, and I felt Craven's camera-work and editing of the wilderness murders displays just that. It felt like someone, hanging around with the brood, was filming their deranged activities.The revenge angle, I think Craven has mentioned this before, displays the theme that almost anyone, if pushed over the edge by some sort of horrifying ordeal, could kill. What could release you from a moral obligation to not harm human life..the murder of your only child perhaps? While perhaps this doesn't leave the same impression as the murders of the girls before, there's still something powerful about what parents will do after the loss of their loved one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An effective exploitation film, but not the end all and be all of shock cinema by a damn sight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently gave Last House on the Left a fresh watch just because I notice it is always borough up as one of the most shocking films of all time. I think it's pretty weak in that respect, but then again I regularly watch materials that would be considered beyond extreme by the casual movie fanatic. I will say I liked Last House a good deal more than I remember and it delivers in key respects, and it definitely deserves credit for being one of the defining films in the history of exploitation. The evisceration of Phyllis, for example, probably opened a whole can of worms that would have filmmakers trying to re-inspire the shock of that on screen savagery to this day.David Hess, I have to say, is one of the best screen villains ever. I buy him as a scumbag implicitly always. I love him in Last House just like I loved him in House on the Edge of the Park and Hitch-Hike. That guy is just a swarthy devil--his "Piss your pants" command is a classic line! The thing I suppose that irks me about Last House more than anything else is the hippie-dippie Brady Bunch quality of Mari's parents and their house--hey look everybody, it's Mike and Carol Brady! Do you think Krug and the gang will want to stay for dinner? Maybe spend the night? Who DOES that? Well, anyway, that's a small complaint from me and the film really does succeed despite that and the dippy comic relief provided by Sheriff Tub O'Lard and Deputy Doofus. It's what I would consider one of only two films the fanboy favorite Wes Craven made that are essential viewing for horror fans, the other being The Hills Have Eyes. Last House has secured its place in history even though it's been trumped time after time--7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mr. Wes Craven is known for making a lot of controversial and inventive films. His most popular is A Nightmare on Elm Street (1984). And of course, like most famous directors, they start out somewhere. Majority of the time, their first attempt is either considered their best and most popular. Here, I don't know why or even how this film gained a remote following. There's nothing artful about this piece. It has no style or class and it makes you wonder how would this ever be considered entertainment.The story is about two girls who head out to celebrate one of their birthdays at a live concert. Little do they realize that along their journey they'll run into some very bad people. These people are described as jail breakers who have no sympathy for anyone. Unfortunately, when these two girls have their run in with these crooks, everything heads south from there. And that's for every aspect of the film too. First and foremost the actors who play the crooks in this movie are extremely frustrating to enjoy. They give no charm to their roles, but I will give credit where it's needed, audiences will hate these villains. That's not to say they were likable though - far from it.The actors who plays the girls and parents of one of the girl's are OK and will make the audience feel bad for them but that's it. They too don't give their respective characters something to really enjoy about. Perhaps by the final act some viewers may like how the characters react to various situations but by then it's too late. By the way, the actor who plays Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) looks like a 70s afro Shia LaBeouf. What similarities - not that I truly care for either actor.Then there's the whole violent element to the film. Is it full of gore? No. Is it heavy? Yes. Are the scenes kept classy? Absolutely not. In fact, many of the scenes are to the point of complete and utter filth. The main cause for this specific description is for the rape scene. Anything involving the action of rape is a serious downgrade in cinematic entertainment. It's one thing to imply it off screen or cutting to another scene, but it's crossing the line to show the action. It wasn't graphic but it's still wrong. Acting or not - that's not entertainment. I made this statement for both Evil Dead (1981) and its remake of 2013. It's not necessary. To see scumbags have their way with a girl will make audiences hate the movie more. Not appreciate it.Also, the cops in this film are lame. They show no wit or integrity either. Their job as officers are as lazy as their characterizations. Even stranger is how the title has nothing to do with anything. The title to this sounds like the story revolves around something inside the last house on the left. Not even, it's just the setting of where the final act takes place. Dumb. Lastly, the music is awful. David Hess the composer (also the scumbag rapist) couldn't even create one memorable tune. Most of the time, the music sounded like a video game. This made Joseph LoDuca's score to the original Evil Dead (1981) sound like a masterpiece. Along with that were horribly insertions of other songs from the time that sounded like hillbilly redneck music. It nowhere matched the tone of anything. Not even the trailer to the movie. Just terrible.The characters are not likable or intelligent, complete with a terrible story, trashy perverted violence and incomprehensible music. Avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many things just don't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we go with another horror movie from the notorious 1970's. I seem to have been on a streak of good or at least decent films of this genre, but sadly, The Last House on the Left ended that streak. The movie is about two seventeen year old girls who are kidnapped by a band of four sadistic murderers and rapists while trying to score some dope. They are violently terrorized, raped, then murdered. Afterwords, the awful gang of people decide to take some temporary refuge in a lovely country house which happens to be the house of one of the girls they just murdered. Violence and terror ensues, but not to much extent. This movie tries to hard, yet at the same time doesn't try hard enough.The entire editing of the film seems shoddy and careless at first, but I soon realized that the director, Wes Craven, was trying to give the film a sort of claustrophobic and sinister feel with the snappy and often times strange cuts. However, whatever he was going for was not achieved in my eyes and I was left with something that just didn't feel right. Perhaps with some more finite tweaking to the structure and editing of the film it would have worked out, but I'm not here to judge the "what ifs" just what I saw on my TV screen. There were some other technical issues that begged me just a little bit, such as a couple of characters whose voices were overdubbed very poorly. I often times don't mind this because it gives the film a strange and independent feel, which works in its own strange way in other low budget horror films like Evil Dead, for example. But here it was just distracting.Probably the biggest issue with The Last House on the Left is its characterization. The film really has four sets of characters, the two seventeen year old girls, the two parents of one of the girls, the four murderers, and two police officers. Each group is either underdeveloped or poorly designed. The film starts without establishing much character, but we do feel a sense of close family ties between the daughter Mari and her loving parents. Yet through the rest of the film the development seems to come to a halt, thus during the gruesome rapes and murders, I didn't feel as much sympathy as I should have. I'm not saying I didn't have sympathy because that's not something that's hard to achieve when you are watching two innocent characters get beaten, raped, and then murdered.At the beginning of the film the parents were developed about as much as the two girls were, and I definitely got a sense of what they were all about, but it didn't go much further from there. Then at the end of the film the parents go on a violent revenge spree against the people who murdered their daughter, and this practically comes out of nowhere. There's no time to develop these hard hitting emotions that these two empathetic characters are experiencing. Instead we jump straight into revenge without any warning. In hindsight, this could work in some way, but it's not too important to dwell on because the girls and the parents are the strongest of the four groups of characters in this film. The problems really arise with the last two groups.The band of four murderers are not doubt disgusting and vile people, who we are obviously supposed to despise with every fiber of our body. This isn't something thats hard to do, but the major problem with these characters is just how ridiculous and foolish they are. They're a bunch of buffoons and some of their interactions are almost comical at times. There are times when they feel utterly harmless because of how idiotic they all are. It's this that completely removes the sense of danger we are supposed to feel emanating from these horrid people, and the film loses all of its claustrophobic and "all hope is lost" feel. At this point it becomes pretty boring as opposed to scary.Finally we have the two police officers who are hired by the parents to find their missing daughter. These are two of the most useless and idiotic characters I've seen in a movie. Every one of their scenes is a slapstick act that isn't even funny. Their roles in the film serve no purpose. Even if they were intentionally utilized to be the comic relief of the film, which seems pretty ridiculous in a horror film like this, then they even failed on that level because instead of a laugh or even a chuckle, all they received from me was an ashamed palm to the face gesture, otherwise known as facepalm.The Last House on the Left could have been good. Hell, it could have been great. It has the right elements, and because it doesn't deal with the supernatural or paranormal, it is something that could actually happen to somebody as innocent as the girls who were murdered in this film. But unfortunately it misses the mark with poor visual decisions and bad characters that couldn't at all keep me interested in this film. There are a dozen other 70's horror flicks that I would recommend before this one, so avoid it and go re watch The Shining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Brady Bunch on acid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this movie. Strangely, this was one of the infamous "nasties" of the 70s/80s which passed me by. Unusually too, I watched the sequel before seeing the original.I hate to say it but the sequel is a much better film: taut, brutal, full of suspense and downright unnerving. What can you say about this one? In a word - Amateur.The film simply doesn't know how to pitch itself. Yes, the violence is upsetting, and yes, the villains are suitably nasty lowlife scum. However, the movie refuses to engage the viewer on any coherent emotional level. Is this down to the poor acting, the cheesy soundtrack, or is it that Wes Craven hadn't really figured out what this film was supposed to be. It's really nothing like The Virgin Spring. Is it a satire on hometown America? Is it a dark allegory of the Vietnam war? Or is it, as I sadly suspect, a bit of a plodding mess? Last House can't even satiate the gorehounds. When the chainsaw comes out at the end I thought, at least we're going to see the chief protagonist get his suitably grisly comeuppance. I suspect the only reason the camera cut away was not due to any sense of taste or restraint but simply that the filmmakers knew that the special effects budget would simply make the scene absurd.But what really ruined the film for me was the ludicrous "keystone cops" sub-plot in which two inept lawmen attempt to hitch a ride on a overloaded poultry truck, slip and fall and throw their hats on the ground like something out of a Lauel &amp; Hardy film. Was this banal attempt at humour an ironic juxtaposition, a dig at authority figures, or what??? You tell me.If The Devil made "The Brady Bunch" this would be it. The film falls woefully short of its promise (and its reputation). Go see the films that really deliver the goods: The Manson Family, The Devils Rejects et al. One for the history books this one, and not a very commendable entry at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What the hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This could possibly be the worst movie ever. I kept hearing it was an dark disturbing film but i found nothing to be disturbing. I know what scenes are meant to have an disturbing effect on the audience, but instead of making me shiver in horror, i wiggled in laughter. The whole thing was awful. If a film is bad, then i accept it . But last house on the left is in a different league entirely.The way they reuse the same shot two or three times. The way they force us to hear the horrid lyrics " and the road leads to nowhere" over and over and over again, truth be told, this film leads to nowhere. The dialogue is just plain wrong. At the beginning of the film, an post man ( i think ) talks to his dog about how this girl is the prettiest girl in the whole of ... i forgot. But it cheesy and lazy. Why let a slob tell us this, can't you show it? . The dad also makes an comment on his daughter nipples. Bad, just bad. What made me laugh was the quick reaction shot of the dog at the beginning , What the hell? . Then there the cops. These two couldn't even catch an cold. They speak like dunces, can't find there way around there own town that there meant to protect. How can you call a film disturbing when you have these two dicks walking around like some comedy actors. then there the bandits who , like the rest of the cast , are given horrible, poorly written parts ( the whole thing is poorly written ). Everything is awful. The disembodiment wasn't disturbing, not when the blood is like thick ketchup. Then , before i knew it, the ending scene was here. I got excited when i heard the chainsaw , i thought i may now see some gruesome killing. I'm not a fan of gruesome films but at the time , i just wished the whole cast was cut up. But once again, the film left me in disappointed. After the father kills everyone ( and the mother biting of the precious parts) he sits down in , covered in blood and then... What this. THE TWO COPS. they pop up from nowhere. Bit late now don't you think cops. Like some pant amine act.I don't care if i sound immature because the truth is i spent 18 pounds on this rubbish. It was an shock to read all these positive comments. If you watched this when it first came out, then yeah you would of found it disturbing , but it still an awful film. It not an film that stands over time. With every year that flows past , it seems to get more funnier and funnier. Everything is plain cheesy and to add on to that is this " to avoid fainting, keep repeating, it only a movie, it only a movie, it only a movie...." oh please. And to imagine, this was made by the creator of nightmare on elm street and hills have eyes , shame on you Craven. I could go on and write an book on how awful this film is</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before WES CRAVEN terrified audiences worldwide &amp; breathed life into one of the most popular cinematic manics of all time with A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET &amp; before he turned the horror genre on it's ear with SCREAM &amp; it's sequels, he directed this truly awful, violent piece of garbage called LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. Supposedly based on true events, the film is actually a modern day remake of THE VIRGIN SPRING, with four psycho's who escape jail, abduct, rape &amp; torture two female victims &amp; then brutally kills them in the woods. Taking shelter with a couple, they discover that their actually in the home of the parents of one of the murder victims &amp; when the parents find their daughter dead &amp; overhear the punks talk about the crime in their room one evening, the parents exact a bloody revenge. I had heard so many good things about Wes Craven's first horror film, that he shot along with Producer SEAN S. CUNNINGHAM (FRIDAY THE 13TH) for many years, but could never find a copy. I also heard many critics &amp; fans say the film was overly bloody &amp; violent. Well they were both right &amp; wrong, they were right when they said the film was overly violent, because man is it ever! we get to see people cut up with chainsaws, unwatchable rape scenes, violent stabbings, a penis chewed off &amp; many other gory moments &amp; they were wrong when they said this film was really good, because unless your only idea of a four star movie is PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is horrible! &amp; I don't mean that in terms of the violent carnage that goes on in the film, I mean it's horrible, but what I'm referring to is the films directing, dialog, acting &amp; suspense. The film is nothing more than a violent stage show &amp; even worse the film tries to be funny at times! the humor comes from, oh excuse me, supposed to come from two cops who are investigating the case but their annoying at best &amp; only slow the film down. Craven's usually good directing is non existent here &amp; the film has many flaws &amp; continuity errors, like how did the parents know where to find their daughter? why didn't the mother act shocked when she found out these punks actually killed her daughter? &amp; even more so, why did the dad say the daughter was dead when they did find her? she was still moving! All in all unless you're just dying to see what Craven's first directorial debut was like, or you want to see a really violent, bad horror movie, I advise you skip this horrible turd, it's not even good for a laugh, in fact it's so bad that it leaves one wondering how Wes ever got any other films produced after this. Remade in 2009* starPROLOX TRIVIA: Wes made over $100,000 on this movie a year after it was released to theaters, but found the films success to be taking a toll on his personal life as friends &amp; family would move away from the table when he went to have dinner &amp; wouldn't even trust their kids alone with him anymore. Some even thought of him as a weird sicko. Wes also stated that he needed to get the violence out of his system &amp; later stated he's never since felt the need to go that far ever again. It also badly effected both him &amp; Sean Cunninghams careers, as both men have had trouble ever since getting non-horror projects off the ground or make them a success.Wes wrote this over a weekend while staying with friends in long island &amp; called it SEX CRIME OF THE CENTURY, until the distributors changed it to LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, a title Craven hated but admits that with it, the film took off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sheer Poetry of the GUT-CHURNING persuasion.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now THIS is a real chiller that deserves the high recommendations it has acquired over the years. I am deeply surprised, and touched, that every generation seems to comprehend the film, and it's seriousness. Some people will not like it, most will wonder how, and why it was made. It is an ART film, an expression! Wes Craven said it himself. He was partially inspired by the violence of that time, what with Manson, Vietnam, and all other cases involving publicly viewed disturbance. He simply took the inspirations, and blended them with the makings of a good ol-fashioned revenge film, as those type of films were very popular in that day and age. You know what? Another thing he touches on, is the fact that a lot of the violence happened around people who were younger, and wanted to stand for peace: The "Love Generation", as character Estelle Collingwood says it. Still, the world was then, as is now, corrupt with violence, and violence only leads to more violence. This film cleverly shows us despair, humiliation, torture, and revenge, in an entire blood bath of ways. There is symbolism behind many of the moments. Parallelism between the two sides, good and bad. I look at this film as sheer poetry of the GUT-CHURNING persuasion, a very dark, but non-the-less real nightmare about the subject which parents fear, and the youth of America are oblivious to. Great film...GREAT film Mr Craven!</fullReview>

Why the hell do people think this is "disturbing" or "shocking", it isnt , its extremely boring , poorly made crap. If u want disturbing or shocking go watch something like Passolini's "Salo" or Deodato's "Cannibal Holocaust" or come to think of it pretty much any other horror movie (save for any new-school "efforts" such as "Scream"). Wes Craven sucks, Scream sucks, but i thought maybe his older work might be better, WRONG. Dont even bother with this, i'd be more pleased to pay the money for a copy and just find a blank tape in the box, it would be less boring to watch. LAME.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sorry, but for those of you who rave this movie, who found it the least bit entertaining, I've got one question? WHY? To me, this movie was pure 100% garbage. First of all, I understand it was filmed thirty years ago, but even back then, they should've had a stronger plot. The dialog was ridiculous, and the logic in the film made 0 sense. What are the odds that these girls go out into the city, meet some sadistic creeps, and these sadistic creeps drive them all the way back upstate and murder them in one of the girls' back yard?! I mean, literally in the girl's backyard, where she can even see her mailbox for crying out-that's how close they are. And another thing, the girl who's home the creeps visited, Mari-when they killed her, she was shot in the pond, but when her parents found her body, she was lying out beside the pond. That part got me, as well as the fact of how did the parents find out where she was? I understand how they found out that they'd killed her, the guy Junior was wearing Mari's necklace, however, how did they know to look in their backwoods for their daughter? In addition to this, they never show the parents communicating or plotting how they were going to seek revenge on these creeps, they just start killing them shortly after that scene I just described.I rented this movie thinking that I would see a great dated horror flick like Texas Chainsaw, but I ended up very disappointed. People said this movie was gory and disturbing. Well, maybe back in 1972 it was, but I wasn't moved by it at all. The rape scenes weren't anywhere near as graphic as everyone said, nor were the killing scenes. I'm sorry I paid $4 to rent the DVD. Do yourself a favor and catch it on a local cable network.</fullReview>

This is so bad it belongs on Science Fiction Theater along with that dude with the talking robot. It is amateurish exploitation schlock at it's lowest form. This is the third film at a Drive-in theater after 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' and 'I Spit on Your Grave'. You know, the one where your either too high to be watching or getting busy with your girlfriend? (Heavy sigh... those were the days...)The acting is horrible, the music is incomprehensibly inappropriate and NONE OF IT IS REMOTELY BELIEVABLE. The two girls are dispatched quickly and we never have anytime to bond with them as characters for it to have any emotional impact. The bad thing about this is young filmmakers watch this and think they can make a good version and we end with torture porn, the very lowest form of horror. Funniest scene is when the father is wielding the chainsaw and it's clearly not on. The one actress, Lucy Grantham, seems to be the only person who can act in the whole thing and it makes me wonder why she didn't have a career. There is nothing good here. It is not even remotely frightening and NOT GROUNDBREAKING AT ALL. It is a wonder to me Wes Craven ever had a chance to direct anything ever again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forty years later, hardly shocking, just badly done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still considered one of the most grotesque horror films of all time, Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left" remains a cult favourite and has gotten numerous critical raves, and for the life of me, I cannot figure out why.A simple story of revenge, that claims to be based on a true story (the only real true story is that the film is based on an Ingmar Bergmann film called Virgin Spring" from 1960), the film with a title that has nothing to do with the plot at all starts with two girls heading to the big city for a concert. On the way, they hope to score some weed and in doing so, get captured by a family of jail escapees who proceed to torture, rape and kill them before happening upon one of the girl's parents, in a coincidental twist that verges on the idiotic. When the parents realize what has happened, you can guess what they do? It is clear that this film was made to simply shock and appal, made by two guys with no experience and no money. Well, no money at the time, anyway?Craven went on to direct "Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream" while producer Sean S. Cunningham is responsible for the entire "Friday the 13th" series. But forty years later, the film does not hold up at all. The violence is almost laughable because the acting is just so horrid, you see very little, the soundtrack, purposely contrasting with the images of violence, is ridiculous and the bits of comic relief are dreadful. What you end up with is a really badly made b-movie horror film that is nothing short of ridiculous on every level.When watching the extras, Wes Craven discusses how the film was made with a bunch of inexperienced people, the one person having any cinematic knowledge being one of the actors...because he had done numerous porn films. Brilliant.It is clear the filmmakers had no experience?nor did they have any idea how to make a film. Maybe this film was shocking was back in 1972, when it was made for $80000 and raked in 3.5 million, but by today's standards, I would expect more from a student film.I have no issue with the sadistic violence. But if you're going to do it, do it well. I'll hope the 2009 remake is far better in terms of blood, guts and acting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow. Finally saw this movie after years of hearing about it, and I'm kinda disappointed. I guess that I have been desensitized to brutality after years of watching films like Salo and I Spit on Your Grave. This film just seems like a warm up to those. But it still got me thinking about how movies nowadays tend to avoid this kind of stark, realistic, brutal violence. Too often we expect the damsel in distress to be rescued by a lantern jawed hero who spouts some cheesy one liner before giving the villain a sound thrashing. Not in this film. There is no escape for our damsels in distress. There is no hero waiting in the wings ready to rescue them right before they get the chop. There is no hope for them, no good luck around the corner. They will be used and abused however their captors see fit until they tire of it, and then... GOODNIGHT! This serves a purpose, in that when the gang finally get their comeuppance you feel that they get whatever they deserve, even though the way they are dispatched is just as sadistic and violent as the acts they committed. I guess studios now want to include at least an element of hope in their films, but why? Things worse than the acts in this film occur every day in every country around the world.I say hats off to Wes Craven for making this film, I still can't believe that after this he would go on to make garbage like Scream!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Real Suburban Fright!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing this one at the drive-in in upstate New York (beautiful as it is in the daytime, come Sundown - it's a scary back road home). I guess people this semi-gore flick was loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring from the late 50's, but it was done on a mocassin-string budget. The actors in this were a combination of Jerry Springer show, bad Quinn Martin productions, color Jerry Lewis imitators, and a few folks who seemed to actually BE THERE. This blows away The Hills Have Eyes (well-done) in terms of "IT"S NOT REAL, IT'S JUST A MOVIE WITH NO STARS IN IT" semi-exploitation plot, but it actually delves into human psychology on a primate form that reliquishes the semi-nude/slasher/rebel format into a Rod Serling world of "what next?) Very frightening, surpisingly non-"bloody" terror motif plot-wise, but spins (the music forewarns you of sanity on it's way) into a morality tale with bite. Almost a docu-drama of suburban paranoia combined with white-trash bad-drug addictions clashing into a fairly normal outcome (despite the abuse of some young people early on).This movie does not condone or exploit violence in a way that, even in the 70's, ANYONE WOULD ENJOY the horror part of this creepy tale, but you do pay attention once a creep turns their back on you (in an, unfortunately, realistic way). Anyway, this film got it's cult status deservedly, which at the time I never thought would happen. This movie disturbed me 30 years ago for the wrong reasons. It's all too POSSIBLE now, which makes it scarier than any horror movie even attempts to tackle anymore. Check it out. You won't forget it and you won't want to see it too many times, but you will remember it in a way similar to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and a few others for scary non-acting realistic fright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As brutally shocking now as it was in 1972!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror master Wes Craven made his directorial debut with this violent, low-budget film that became a landmark of modern horror.A gang of sadistic criminals kidnaps and tortures two teenage girls, but little do they know, they'll be spending the evening with one of their victim's vengeful parents.For all it's budgetary limitations, Craven's Last House on the Left is a film with the undying power to shock and disturb. It's a film that explores a different kind of terror, the darkness that can exist within the human heart. This film is completely merciless in its violence and that is the strength behind its impact. Last House' is a truly gruesome show that is not at all for the faint of heart or stomach. Craven took what materials and actors he could find and made the most frightening and horrific movie he could. Little did he know what its effects would be!For such a shoe-string production, the cast is surprisingly strong. David Hess is probably best, as a ruthless and powerful leader for the cruel gang. His performance is solidly frightening! Cassel and Grantham make fairly believable victims, it's easy to feel sorry for them. Fred Lincoln is perfectly sleazy in his role as a gang member, while Jeramie Rain is genuine in her sadistic madness. Marc Sheffler is effectively sympathetic as the reluctant son of Hess.The Last House on the Left was the first bold mark in Wes Craven's long career, and will probably always stand as one of the most unsettling films of the exploitation genre.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During its first run in the early 70s this was the only movie I ever walked out on (until Alien vs. Predator last year), and the only one I rated 1 out of 10. However, I watched it recently and I've changed my mind. Certainly there have been many more explicitly violent films in the 30 odd years since Last House on the Left debuted, but this movie still stands up for pure psychological impact. Despite the sometimes over the top banter among the criminals it still has a kind of realism that makes its "its only a movie" tag line particularly appropriate. This is not a great film (and it is still uncomfortable viewing), but it is a good film. Unless you're a sociopath yourself you won't enjoy the violence any more than the violence in the opening of "Saving Private Ryan", but you won't forget it. I never did.Wes Craven has nothing to be ashamed of here.I give it 7 of out 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Real monsters don't have goalie masks or gloves with blades. Not to pick on these movies,they have their place, but "Last House on The Left" is not your typical horror movie. It is more disturbing than 'jump out of your seat scary'. To reap the full impact of this movie you should place yourself in the position of the two girls. You couldn't tell by looking at them that the creeps in this movie are capable of what they did. Unlike most horror movies, this is something that could probably happen, and similar things have happened maybe not moment for moment or action for action but they have. Young girls, women, and even children, have been abducted, raped and murdered unfortunately. Furthermore, I bet their parents or other family members would love to have the opportunity of revenge. Perhaps, the subject matter may even be a little too realistic and intense for some viewers.Rather than hiding under the blankets, or jumping at every single noise like other movies, after this movie, I felt like crying. The girls seemed so ordinary like they could have been almost any teenage girls. There were things that I didn't like about the movie, such as, the soundtrack was very corny at points, and the camera work left something to be desired. However, I do not think that this movie should be just tossed aside for being 'not scary', so, not a worthwhile horror movie. Again, if you can stomach the subject matter it is definitely worth giving it a chance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The problem with movies these days is that the majority of them are so slick, they never allow you to forget that it's a movie. Every last person from the school teacher to the garbage man is exceptionally good-looking, truck stop waitresses have nicer clothes and apartments and better teeth than you do, and people get the crap beat out of them without messing up their hair or tearing their designer threads. People even look great when when they're lying in their hospital deathbed or bleeding by the gallon in an alley. What's to be scared of? We know this isn't our world.That's why looking back at 'Last House on the Left' is such an excruciating shock, especially comparing it to any one of Wes Craven's latter films. It is alternately graphic and discreet, perfect in it's imperfection. When Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham)is beset from all sides getting stabbed by Krug and his cronies, her mouth drops open, her eyes roll back in her head, her knees give out; it is only her attackers holding her up that keeps her from crumbling.Stabbed repeatedly in the abdomen,her pants start to fall off; her goofy-looking underwear are a droopy fit, and you can see a faint trace of an unshaved bikini area. Her body is every bit as realistic as her response. It also isn't clear at what point she actually dies, and it seems like you can almost feel her pain. The whole way through, it all seems very much like what really happens in a crime of this sort, and how it would feel to actually be there.Part of this effect is due to the camera angle; not enough credit is given to how much cinematography dictates the narrative. Most movies have either an omniscient viewpoint, where the viewer seems to be on the inside looking out, or from the vantage point of one particular character, or alternating between different character's eye view. LHOL positions you on the outside looking in, like an unnoticed interloper. You can see what's happening and yet are helpless to act.Another element that makes the film so tremblingly smart is the characterization of the killers themselves- as normal people who just happen to be extremely violent, and you have no idea why. If you were to meet them, it seems, you wouldn't like them, but it probably wouldn't occur to you to be scared of them, either;they just seem like a bunch of goofy punks. That is, except, for David A. Hess's Krug Stillo, who comes of as just about the nastiest, most vile- and undoubtedly REAL- villain ever, with a certain crude, smirking animal sexiness that only serves to make him that much more threatening. (Hess, in fact, probably makes the movie).Although this film could have been done better- get rid of some of the cornier tunes and the lame comedy sequences with the bumbling, stupidly unfunny cops- it still manages to accomplish exactly what it was going for, which is more than can be said for about 80% of the films that have ever been made. Lets just hope that some starved-for-original-ideas horror pimp doesn't ruin a good thing by trying to remake it; cross your fingers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Seminal Scream</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm very divided as to how I feel about this movie. On one hand, if I look past the many mistake the filmmakers made and see the symbolism about a crumbling society at the familial level and the evil man can do to his fellow man, then it works. On the other hand, it doesn't transcend but wallows in its horror as if it's embraced it complete: the revenge-violence that literally explodes from the very protectors of family, instead of resolving anything, only complicates things.The DVD has Wes Craven giving his "caveat emptor" to the viewer. I think it's a little unnecessary but I can see why: having been hit so hard from all sides and being almost forced to disown having ever even done this movie it would be the only correct thing to do. It's as if the Marquis of Sade, had he been writing his controversial books in this day and age, would write a foreword where he would let even mentally open people aware that what they are holding in their hands is a potentially damaging book.LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is an imperfect grind-house horror movie about two girls, Mari and Phyllis, who on their way to a rock concert meet a grim fate. The opening shot, of the mailman depositing Mari Collingwood's mail as we get flash-cuts of her emerging, virginal, from the shower while David Hess' mournful song "The Road Leads to Nowhere" plays like a forewarning, is great because it gives us a chance to see her in a near-perfect stage of her life when nothing could go wrong.Later on as both Mari and her friend Phyllis hit the road, we get mixed radio signals playing snippets of the songs featured in the movie, leading to a radio report of escaped killers. We're then introduced to these killers: when we see them, they're no more menacing than the Manson girls looked in 1969. I think Craven's choice of these amateur actors (among them David Hess in an ironic choice) was risky but it eventually paid off. Seeing how displaced and even childlike these people are, that in itself makes them dangerous.We get to see just how lethal they can be when their path dovetails with that of Mari and Phyllis, who are looking for their own way of momentary escape -- weed. It's clear something ugly is going to happen between these four people and it comes fast, but fast is not enough: a protracted torture sequence done in a cat and mouse relationship is sadistic to the extreme, as is near escape leading to a ferocious, ritualistic murder, and a horrifying rape scene shown up so close it makes us participants. And like the killers, we feel like we're equally horrified at what has taken place. When Hess fired his gun at Mari, it's almost a last chance at erasing his act, although like Hitchcock's horrific murder sequence in TORN CURTAIN, death doesn't come easy even in a placid lake.The reversal of LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is sharp. The killers are looking for a place to stay during the evening and wind up in Mari Collingwood's parent's house. A dinner sequence is great in establishing a scene where these people have come together with no clue as to how their lives have merged and with the black background and sparse decoration seems an abstraction.My only problem with this portion of the movie is that once the Collingwoods learn of what has happened to their daughter they show no emotional transition, nothing to indicate the horror and agony they must feel -- after all, they've lost their only daughter. As a matter of fact, once they begin to suspect what we already know, they make no move to contact the proper authorities and I find that hard to believe that even in the early Seventies one couldn't file a missing person's report. Also, it would have been literally impossible for them to guess where Mari would be, apparently still alive according to the way she is still moving when we see her at the lake's shore, but this is probably an editing error or a plot hole or both. And anyway, logic sometimes doesn't add up in horror movies, especially in its ferocious denouement.From a cinematic point of view LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is uneven. The introduction of the killers is at most bland, especially in the ad-libbed scene between Jeramie Rain and Marc Sheffler. The introduction of two cops (Martin Kove and Marshall Anker) and most notably their interaction with Ada Washington stops the movie dead in its tracks. The alternating cross-cutting between Mari and Phyllis as they meet their captors to their parents at home is that of clumsy editing but at least sets the film up for a rising sense of dread. The movie is best when it focuses on the escalating tension between the girls and the killers -- I couldn't but feel gut-punched when the two girls were ordered to take off their clothes, Sandra Cassel starts crying, and Lucy Grantham comforts her (which bulks up her character's importance and turns her into a heroine instead of relegating her to second victim).Wes Craven has with his movie a story that steps well past the boundaries of what you could show or not show in slasher movies. A sequence in which Sadie lovingly fondles Phyllis' entrails was cut and can only be seen in the DVD extras and maybe it's best. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT has seen a revival in recent horror trends of showing people doing extreme things to other people and it's a sad legacy. I can't recommend it, but it's there, not a bad movie, not a good movie, but one that is extreme, hollow, and voyeuristic in the way it makes the viewer part of the horror, and caveat emptor to anyone seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as some say, not as bad as many say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers!! "Last House On The Left" is best described as inconsistent. The movie is based on an incredibly ambitious and intellectual idea (which is quite amazing if you consider the background of it) but it can't quite deliver on that promise. I think in many ways it has more in common with psychological drama than horror movies and if I had to think of a movie "The Last House On The Left" reminds me of I have to say Clockwork Orange comes up in my mind, not "Nightmare On Elm Street" or other famous horror movies. Alex and his gang never got up to acts of violence quite as depraved as those acted out by Krug and his gang but both gangs share this anarchic sense of vicious brutality for the sake of it. Of course TLHOTL is not nearly as good a movie as the Clockwork Orange, in fact, TLHOTL is a rather badly crafted movie. But nevertheless both are pieces of the very specific "Zeitgeist" of the early 70s.The movie is not nearly as good as it could or maybe even should be though. Mainly because it is, as said at the beginning, quite inconsistent.The movie can be easily divided into three sections, the beginning which sets up the events to follow by displaying the "peaceful suburban lives" of the victims and also the crude existences of Krug and his gang. The beginning is unfortunately marred by bad editing and a bad script which leads to two things: 1) you dont really get to know the girls and the family of Mari well enough to really create conventional drama in the rest of the movie 2)it actually does help in setting up the criminals to be quite weird oddballs which is in my view helping the realism of the movie's middle part quite a bit.The middle part is the strong point of the movie and it's here where the movie earns its accolades. This middle part begins with the two girls falling into the hands of the Krug gang in New York City and depicts the humiliation, psychological and physical torture, raping and eventual killing and mutilating of the girls in woods which are located near the house of one of the victims. This part is quite disturbing to watch as it lets you take a rather good peek into the abyss of human cruelty. Even the often maligned score can be creepily effective here as the soft sound of an acoustic guitar accompanies scenes of human tragedy. I have to say this part is by far the most chilling depiction of sex crimes I have seen yet in movies.The thugs arent in any way depicted as special, clever, tough or crafty, they are shown as lowlife failures, clumsy and simple, their viciousness shown only by their actions not their pose. The movie spends quite a lot of time with them, the focus is as much on them as it is on the victims which gives us a sense of disgusting intimacy with the killers. The movie offers us no real motivation for the acts of the killers, their crimes are commited for no specific reason or rather reasons deeply embedded in their disturbed psyches which arent shared with the viewers. This look on the killers is more realistic and more disturbing than the super killers we usually are confronted with in horror movies and thrillers. The victims are portrayed fairly well too. Phylis is the "rough girl" of the two and consequently follows one path possible to victims of such a crime - defiance and resistance. Mari, the daughter of our avengers-to-be, is the "soft innocent girl" and generally acts more submissively and mostly pleads to the criminals. The victims arent particularly smart or strong, they arent depicted as overly weak or stupid either, they just act as one could reasonably expect normal girls to act in such a terrible situation. The suffering of the victims is depicted as intimately and harshly as the behavior of the killer. Everything here feels very immediate and I think it's that and the realism provided by the banal way in which both killers and victims are portrayed what makes this part so disturbing to watch. Dont expect cinematography at its best here either though, it's a sloppily made movie throughout and while interestingly and possibly unintentionally it adds a lot to this part, it also subtracts a lot from the movie as a whole.The end depicts the gang of killers ending up at the home of Mari's parents who unsuspectingly let them in thinking they are salespeople. The parents discover what happened to their daughter and her friend and extract revenge on the killers and kill them in grotesque fashion (one gang member has his penis bitten off by the mother of the victim, Krug is killed by the father with a chainsaw, the female gang member's throat is slit by the mother,the demented junior member of the gang is forced to commit suicide by Krug in a rather bizarre twist). Being the ending this obviously is a core of the supposed message of the movie but one has to admit that it's butchered by a horrible script and it has to be said that this movie would probably make a better impression if it ended once Mari has been killed. The actions of the parents and their motivations are badly explained and generally the movie is just going through the motions here to get to an end, there is little drama, little psychology and, as a total contrast to the middle part, very little intimacy in this part. This is a part of the movie where a better script could've worked wonders and you can see that Craven didnt really think of it as a potential masterpiece or even a proper drama at any point (or else he would have given this part more attention when writing the script). This ending however is at least honest to its intentions as it does not glorify these revenge killings in any way, the viewer is not inclined at all to cheer for the parents on their revenge killing spree. However it also totally fails in depicting the process of law-abiding good-natured citizens turning into brutal killers which is somewhat essential to make the story work.Before I come to a conclusion I may add that there are parts throughout this movie which show two bumbling cops blundering their way through the countryside. These parts are embarrassingly trying to be funny and it's incredibly difficult to see why they are in this movie at all. I do think the idea of depicting incompetent cops does have a potential role in the story. When cops are shown to be idiots then one layer of our traditional sense of security is removed, we realize that law and order are not factors we can count on in this scenario. However these cops here are portrayed in such a corny over the top way, one feels reminded of bad British slapstick comedy of the 60s which removes any sort of serious purpose these scenes could have and since they arent funny they dont work as "comic relief" either.I shall conclude that "The Last House On The Left" supposedly tells us a story about the futility of violence and how violence itself has a dehumanizing effect on those who exert it. But I have to say that it fails in bringing that point across consistently and that's probably why you have to say the movie falls short of its ambitions. Much of the movie is incredibly corny, there is bad acting and a bad script. As a low-budget movie it's not overly well shot either. One has to say that as a "rape revenge" drama it is a failure as the revenge part is just bad. It works much better as a rape drama and indeed it is the disturbingly realistic depiction of the victims' humiliating ordeal starting with their apprehension in NYC and their brutal deaths in those woods which redeems this movie. It's a harsh and blunt look at the human abyss and as such it is not only disturbing but also valuable to those fascinated by human depravation (and I suppose judging by the popularity of books, shows and movies relating to serial killers and other psychopaths that basically means all of us).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolute Worthless Garbage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't care what print of this film I saw, there was absolutely no redeeming value in this alternately boring, wretchedly made horror opus. I truly cannot believe how many people actually like this pile of garbage. It did not scare me at all; it did not entertain me at all; in fact, the only thing I wondered was what the point of this whole exercise was. If one is going to make a trashy, nearly plot less movie at least one should make it entertaining. I've seen lots of horror movies; some good and some OK and then I've seen ones like this: in serious need of having the celluloid recycled into ANYTHING else. I will not watch this movie again. And not because it disturbed me because of its plot line, but because it was just so damn bad with a capital "B". Some folks find this movie to be Wes Craven's masterpiece. Some folks, therefore, are in need of therapy because only a basket case would find this poorly made rubbish to be the epitome of Wes Craven's output. Whoever used their money to bankroll this amateurish mish-mash should have spent it on scientific research on how crap like this becomes a "masterpiece" in the eyes of some people. Ugh!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This delightful black comedy is so harrowing because its tone is so hilariously flippant. Long before 'Scream', Craven was engaged in analysing the fundamentals of horror - audiences, expectations, representation, ethics. To find a film featuring extended and graphic scenes of torture, rape, mutilation and murder 'delightful' is to ask a lot of hard questions about yourself as a viewer, maybe even as a person. it's not enough to say 'Craven made me', as he juxtaposes a horrendous gang raping of a teenage virgin with the bumbling exploits of two comedy cops; a number of people left the cinema, and made their choice. So did I.The story is a remake of Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring', adapted with surprising aptness to the backwoods of post-hippie America. Birthday girl Mari and her friend Phyllis go to see metal band Bloodlust in a 'rough' neighbourhood. At the same time, a pair of ruthless killers have escaped jail, hooking up with their moll and the leader's junkie son. Mari and Phyllis, eager to 'score' some 'grass' (man) on this exciting night of new-found independence, ask a loitering Junior Stillo if he has anything. He invites them into the killers' hideout, and the ghastly horrors begin.Right from the beginning, the tone of this film is almost jauntily comic, from Mari's parents' (sometimes sinister) fuddy-duddy routine, to the news description of the escapees. This comedy comes from a number of sources, from exaggerration, incongruity, or just the sheer strangeness of people with these delicious faces saying certain things.Craven goes to great lengths to compare the two families in a very Bergman way, from the pets they both share, to the generation tensions.Initially, the film had seemed like a reactionary moral lesson - a young girl in the first flush of her burgeoning sexuality, her bosom finally developing, goes to a violent concert in a dodgy neighbourhood, without a bra - isn't she just asking for trouble? This is classic, reactionary liberal-baiting - her parents, despite their token protests, are children of the hippy ethos; father even gives Mari a CND necklace for her birthday. Mari leaves the safe cloister of home for freedom and the big city, and is punished for it, a victim of the women's lib Krug so despises.Craven sets this up because it makes us feel safe, it gives us a position, recognising as we do contemporary films on a similar subject, eg. 'Dirty Harry', 'Death Wish'. BUt when he brings Mari back home, playing out her destruction in the heavily symbolic forest, we realise that his appropriation of Bergman isn't superficial. Although the film seems to be that perennial theme, the external threat to the family, Craven shows that its roots are within, in Mari's fairy-tale sheltered upbringing. So remote that the phone doesn't even work; friendless until a year ago, Mari's only confidante was her mother.Mari is 17, and yet she is only hitting puberty now. This biological suppression, this unnatural delay finds an outlet in violence - the violence done to Mari, to the family, the home, the wood, but also the film's form, which veers so wildly in tone. .Craven isn't the first horror director to take inspiration from Bergman, whose terse narratives are full of terrors unavailable to the generic director. He lacks Bergman's stern, parable-like concentration, but the transplantation from a mythical, Protestnat, symbolic space is effective, and Craven's style is full of low-budget inventiveness. Another possible influence is Godard, in the way Craven flagrantly shocks in the disparity of his content and the way he expresses it - the 'horrifying' denouement is pure farce, a routine of assorted vaudeville turns.Like Godard, one could argue that his progressive experiments are undermined by misogyny - it's always the spectacle of terrorised women that is used to 'subvert' or 'expose' something or other. It is about times somebody took their cue from 'Deliverance'. What is certain is that the term black comedy should never be used so lightly again - a film like 'Heathers' or 'War of the Roses' can never disturb a viewer as disturbingly as this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One viewing is enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's first film is without a doubt one of the most brutal, intense and shocking movies you'll ever see. Before our eyes a catalogue of atrocities are carried out through the grainy eye of the unblinking camera. To make matters worse, Craven makes us get to know and care about the characters before the violence begins, which of course makes the eventual bloodshed all the more worse. Indeed this film made me queasy while watching, and it's not an easy film to sit through. It might be a good film, yes, but its definitely not enjoyable. Would you want to watch it again? I don't think so.The film's low budget merely adds to the overall gritty feel of it. The only thing out of place is the inappropriate cheerful music which keeps popping up all of the time, we could have done without this. All characters are three-dimensional and understandable, even the psychopaths. Yes, they're psychopaths, but these people could be real, such things really do happen in real life. David Hess went on to carve himself a niche in these type of roles, as to portray a cold-blooded sadist was something he did with frightening realism. Cassel and Grantham are likable and heart-breaking as the subjects of the violent attacks, scenes hard to watch. Everybody in this film puts their heart into it.Craven even experiments with manipulation of the viewer, in the final scenes getting us to cheer on a chainsaw murderer. The film questions violence and the primitive way in which it is a part of human nature. I wouldn't really recommend this film, see it if you have to. One viewing is way more than enough though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two girls are abducted, tortured and raped while on their way to a concert. What ensues brings upon dire consequences for the suspects.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the early 70's, exploitation films began to run the gamut of seedy, dilapidated theaters that were sprawled throughout cities. Featuring an extremely low budget, exploitation films captured an essence of the culture, one that began to emerge after the death of the late 60's summer of love. When The Last House on the Left was introduced to the public, it was advertised with the tagline "to avoid fainting, keep repeating it's only a movie?it's only a movie." What Wes Craven presents to the audience with his first feature length film is a tacky, ultra-violent, and ultimately unnecessary foray into exploitation cinema, yet one that is sickeningly satisfying, helping change the face of cinema forever.Quickly establishing itself as a film with little morals, but with the potential for values, The Last House on the Left opens with the loving and caring family of the Collingwoods, whose house rests with woods on each side. On the eve of their daughter Mari's (Sandra Cassel) 17th birthday, her parents agree to let her attend a concert in the city with her friend Phyllis (Lucy Graham). Attempting to score some weed after the show, Phyllis encounters Junior (Marc Sheffler), the son of newly escaped convict Krug (David Hess), who has holed up in an apartment building along with fellow fugitives Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Fred "Weasel" Podowski (Fred Lincoln). What follows is exactly what the films tagline wants you to begin repeating to yourself, "it's only a movie?it's only a movie." Produced by Sean S. Cunningham, who would later direct one of the most quintessential slasher films of our time with Friday the 13th, The Last House on the Left is filmed with the exact low budget graininess that other exploitation films of its time are. One defining difference Wes Craven gives it is an immense sense of well being, established by the blossoming friendship of Mari and Phyllis. While I've certainly never discussed my newly developed testicles or how my body has really filled out over the past season with anyone, watching it being discussed by the two establishes innocence, one that only a woman and possibly her parents could truly feel. This innocence, aided by the loving care of Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood builds us up for the inevitable drop that comes with the young women encountering the gang of fugitives.What Wes Craven seems to labor too intensively on amidst the rape, torture, and ultra-violence is the supposed necessity to lighten the mood whenever the camera shifts away from the perversion in the woods. Given the seriousness and gravity of what is laid out in front of us, the film becomes less exploitative than it does tacky with the goofy, Three Stooge like behavior of the bumbling law men, played by Marshall Anker and Martin Kove. Mixed between cuts of oral rape, dismemberment, and shootings is a score, with pieces provided by David Hess himself, that detaches us from what has burrowed deep within our core, coming off like a B.J. Thomas mock.While remaining unnecessary with its representation of violence towards women, its poorly timed comedic cuts, and its misguided musical choice, The Last House on the Left has remained as significant as it did when it first hit low budget cinema in 1972. It's ability to stick with you long after the credits have rolled is a true testament to the strength and passion of its creators, playing as a true labor of love rather than a simple shock piece. What Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham have provided stands not only as a staple in exploitation cinema, but as a milestone in horror, paving the way for years of gore, screams, and macabre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Partly legendary, partly amateur stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An important film for the horror genre, but failing in several respects. The dialogues and acting are for the greater part below par, and the soundtrack is, especially in the beginning, pretty annoying. One or two hippie songs to underline the mood and state of mind of the two young females would have worked, but this is overkill. Then, there's the two bumbling coppers acting as if they are playing in 'The dukes of Hazard'. Wes Craven may have tried to make a point about the failing of police when it comes to cases like these, but he does not find the right tone of things.But, when the 'happy' music dies down and only a few somber, eerie tones sound through the forest and the actual debaucheries begins, the film really picks up. Even if I remembered the cruelties and gore to be more elaborate, this part is still pretty shocking and impressive. The best part of the movie - legendary, in fact.The results of the final confrontation between the parents and the wrecking crew is again rather variable (acting, writing, etc.); they (mom and dad) seem to just go their separate ways, leave lots of room for the rapists / killers to get away or even strike back. 'Somehow' things sort of 'work out' in their (mom and dad's) favour, but, for instance, when mom goes off seducing one of them in the woods (and...), it just feels way too contrived and far-fetched. Well, it's an exploitation movie, of course, but still.The middle part would deserve about 8 to 9 out of 10, but rest of it ranges from about 3 to 5 out of 10. I'm settling on a small 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seems like an attempt at a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how people can say this movie is worse than the remake as most of the violent scenes are off camera, punches clearly don't connect, blood stains on the wall look like cheap paint splattered randomly, and it all looks very fake. What disappointed me the most is a scene where the girls were made to kiss after stripping their clothes off, actually happened off camera. I guess this is because in 1976, two girls kissing on the big screen was considered a bigger taboo than two girls getting raped and murdered. The acting was very wooden as you'd expect from a 1970s horror movie and I wasn't scared one little bit. I thought this was an attempt at a comedy more than a horror actually.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can never understand the real importance of a soundtrack before watching this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm sure in the 70's this was quite a show, and an amazing suspense or whatever movie, and I can see how it can be considered very good, but I couldn't take half the movie seriously because the soundtrack was so inadequate. In scenes that were supposed to be intense, like the runaway part they put songs that seemed to have been taken out of a cartoon or a cowboy movie or something. Even the rape scene, which in the new one is one of the most intense scenes, did absolutely nothing for me on this one. The choice of songs was very unfortunate and it didn't go well with the whole atmosphere of the movie, or the atmosphere I hoped it had. It was frankly disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed, and slightly dated, torture-porn which nevertheless still packs a decent punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by horror maestro Wes Craven ('Nightmare on Elm St' and 'Scream') and produced by Sean Cunningham ('Friday the 13th'), 'Last House on the Left' is one of those titles which has left an indelible mark on the cinematic landscape in daring to have taken its viewers on an excursion into the outer reaches of what is permissible.The story is an updating of Ingmar Bergman's revenge tragedy 'The Virgin Spring' (1960) but where Bergman's movie is set in Medieval Sweden, Craven sets 'Last House?' in the present (a move which shows how archetypal such a story and such emotions are) and centers around two teenage girls: Mari (Cassel) and Phyllis (Grantham) who are planning to go to a rock concert in New York City. Along the way they happen upon Junior, a reluctant member of a deviant quartet also composed of Fred "Weasel" Podowski, Sadie, and the head-honcho Krug (Hess). Junior takes the girls to the group where they then have to undergo a horrendous series of violent and sexual acts before being brutally murdered?all for kicks. Then, through a fateful coincidence the quartet end up taking refuge at the house of one of the murdered girls and, when the parents come to realise what has happened to their daughter and who is responsible, savage redemption is enacted.Brutal stuff...and still unpleasant viewing today, even in a climate where torture porn has become a (somewhat) mainstream genre. This is no doubt due to the atmosphere of brutal realism which the film effectively creates through a pseudo-documentary style cinematography (presumably due to the low budget). Still, while the movie irrefutably deserves the evocative epithets like "disgusting", "disturbing", "visceral" and so on which it acquired upon its release, and its later inevitable placing on the list of Video Nasties drawn up by the Director of Public Prosecutions in the UK in the early 80s, a modern viewer may well find the overall impact of the movie less than what they expect from the hysteria which surrounds it. This may well come from some patchy acting, some patchy editing, and the inclusion of slapstick interludes (presumably the metaphorical spoonful of sugar to help the medicine go down) which seem incongruous and taint the atmosphere of menace which other films which followed in the wake of 'Last House?' ('I Spit on your Grave', 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' 'Cannibal Holocaust' etc.) would present unrelentingly.Still, messy it may be, but 'Last House?' is still important and worth watching, not because it opened the door for the shock and gore fests of the Seventies and Eighties which in ramping everything upto 11 only succeeded in titillating the audience at best?boring them at worst, but in beginning (albeit slightly inarticulately) to provide a social commentary on violence through a direct cinematic presentation of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low Budget Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven directed this low budget horror film in 1972. He claims to have been inspired by Ingmar Bergman's Virgin Spring. Mari plans to go to a concert with her friend Phyllis for her 17th birthday. Her parent's give her a peace sign on a chain as a present. They hear of a prison escape on the radio while driving. The escapees are a rapist, a sadist, a serial killer and a child molester, a quartet of the highest character.The two young ladies make the mistake of trying to by some marijuana, and they encounter one of the three bad men, Junior, and he takes them back to an apartment, where his two fellow, former inmates, and their female accomplice have a party with the two nubile women. The unwilling teen are sexually assaulted in every way possible.They put the girls in the trunk of their car, but it breaks down in front of Mari's house. They go into the woods and torture their captives, even cutting off Phyllis's arm; this is not a Disney feature.This does eventually lead to some vicious payback by Mari's mother, which you will have to see to believe. Overall, an o.k. movie for little money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic horror film, but not because of the soundtrack</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just watched the film. I wanted to watch it because it really looked scary and disturbing. Is « The last house on the left » a disturbing film ? Yes, it is. BUT ! What makes it bad for a lot of people is, in my opinion, the music. The soundtrack is... well, bad ! It just doesn't fit at all with the pictures on screen. The movie as guts, it shows reel horror. It has an ambiance full of pain and the ending is just incredible. There's a rape scene, a suicide, guns, knifes, blood and murders. Everything in this movie is scary and shocking. The funny music ruins it all. During one scene, two cops are going after the bad guys, but the music in this scene makes it look like a scene from a comedy. It's not a good thing when you've just saw something really shocking happening 2 seconds earlier and then you see two cops acting like old actors from silent comedy of the 20's, it ruins the ambiance.To be honest, the movie is great. It's a horror classic for sure. One thing the remake as over the original is, again, the soundtrack. For me the remake is superior in the way that it's done (good acting, great ambiance) but fails with the ending though, the one in the original is way better. But anyway, what I wanted to say about this film, is that it has a great horror picture to offer, but (sadly) it covers it with a bad soundtrack. If music is not important for you, or like me you can (with some efforts) forget it when it's bad, you'll enjoy this film like I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you should go into the woods today....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The cinematic equivalent of a swift kick to the nuts, Craven's debut is a leisurely stroll through human debasement, not soon forgotten by viewers, even those already hardened by thousands of hours of on-screen carnage.Two fun loving teens find themselves in a dilly of a pickle when a gang of crazed Perverts whisk them to a magical afternoon in the woods where were lucky enough to watch them be stripped, tortured, raped, mutilated (one over-enthused nut signs his name with knife-point on one heroine's chest) Then by contrived twist, the group find themselves guests of their victim's parents who enact a terrible, costly revenge....Amateurish, disgusting, repellent, depraved....and completely recommended. Cheap exploitation fare if not for one critical factor: Craven simply refuses to glimpse away. Instead, he turns the viewer's expectations upside down &amp; gives them what they thought they wanted: a terrifying experience. He rubs our faces in the forest debauchery, exploring with an unflinching eye every aspect of the reality of violence, not the cartoon version found in your typical body-count movie. The viewer has the privilege of watching one girl crawl on the ground &amp; writhe in agony as her captors watch attentively before finally gutting her and toying with her intestines. Are we having fun yet? Craven's lack of finesse is glaringly apparent, its clumsily put together but the bottom barrel approach works brilliantly once the torture starts. A glamorized presentation would only serve to distance us from the proceedings and thus insulate the brute impact of the scenario. Its schizophrenic tone is it's biggest drawback (slapstick buffoonery in a Rape/revenge flick?)but the abrupt shift from whimsical teenage antics to one thug ordering a girl to soil herself is jarring to say the least. Craven sets you up with idealistic 70's teeny-bopper fluff and then pulls the rug from under you, battering you senseless with his grindhouse imagery. Its ambush film-making at it's finest. No frantic editing, no flashy cinematography; just a documentary's unflinching view of depravity. Its brutally, callously efficient &amp; not a lick of fun, nor kinetic-because its not supposed to be. This is an ordeal, not an amusement park ride. Those claiming moral bankruptcy have completely missed the point: Is it sick to show an actual approximation of such things? Many will just read that as a cop-out, but I don't think it is here. The killer's remorseful faces proceeding their dastardly deeds, equal measures shock &amp; self disgust, really indicates there's something deeper going on than mere masturbation.John Q. public consumes on-screen mayhem with the fervor of skat-addicts snorting half of Columbia up their nostrils. We just love candy-coated chaos, the more insanely elaborate the better, but what 'Last House' does so deftly is bring it back down to a human scale and sincerely ask the audience "Is this what you really want to see?" I can't say I enjoyed it, at least not in any traditional sense, but to blame it for doing to good a job is retarded. 'Last House on the Left' is horrifying &amp; flicks like it should be required viewing for de- sensitized screen addicts like me as a half-way accurate portrayal of senseless violence.A kick to the balls isn't fun, but it sure as hell wakes you up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloodlust and Sadie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is one of Wes Craven's first films. You can tell it was made on a string budget. Most of the cast is unheard of and the story is a thriller. The film begins with Mari and Phyllis, two teenage girls from the suburbs, who go to the city to see Bloodlust, a rock group, in concert. They never come home. Mari's birthday is the next day and her parents have set up a Happy Birthday Banner in their modest home. Well, Mari and Phyllis are also looking to score some grass as well. Unfortunately, they end up with three male sadists (murderers on the loose from prison) and Sadie (a female sadist who enjoys the crimes as well as the men do). Anyway, they kidnap the two girls and you can imagine the horror. They bring up to the suburbs where somehow they end up in Mari's parents home. I won't spoil the rest. It's gruesome and not for the squeamish. The story was remade surprisingly and the film was a hit. I saw it on television so they probably edited it out even the gruesome spots as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One great scene in search of a movie... One great scene in search of a movie... One great....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time I watch this movie (which is not often, I promise...) I want it to be so much better. But that one outstanding mid-section ? the kidnapping, rape and murder of two teenage girls ? is the whole basis for this film's entire reputation. And deservedly so: it is a sequence of undeniable skill and raw power. The rest of the film, however, is just not very good. Badly shot, badly written and with head-shakingly bad use of 'comic' relief, the film betrays the lack of experience in first time writer-director Wes Craven. Had the rest of the film been made in the style of that unforgettable midsection, we would probably be looking at a five-star rating now. Alas, it is never to be...The torture-rape-murder sequence certainly justifies that memorable tagline. The rough, grainy cinéma vérité style and that incredible 'performance' by Sandra Cassell really do give this the appearance of reality. I use inverted commas around the word performance since, if the stories are to be believed, Cassell was genuinely frightened and upset in that scene and it certainly shows. The moment when Grantham (the actress) calms and comforts Cassell (the actress) during their humiliation is heartrending and utterly harrowing, lending this scene an almost unbearable sense of tragedy and horror. Craven's use of a lachrymose ballad (penned by star Hess) merely adds to the effect, as does Hess's startling performance as sadistic thug Krug. (In fact, all of the principal actors with the exception of Sheffler are excellent.) Overall, this is a sequence that just gels, in spite of Craven's inexperience, and one that lingers in the mind long after watching it. Craven then (amazingly) tops this moment with a protracted and painful murder sequence in which Grantham is mutilated and disembowelled by the Manson-like group. Again, the realism of the scene hits you at gut level: raw, hand-held camera-work, ugly, messy special effects and convincing acting all round gives the moment an incredible punch.But from then on it's sadly downhill. Had Craven been allowed to have his scalpel-torture finale instead of the more Grand Guignol chainsaw one, then maybe this would have been a slightly more effective film. But as it is, The Last House on the Left is one truly great sequence surrounded by amateurish crap, albeit still preferable to the recent, crappier remake.Film: *** Nastiness: ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sadistic, vile and primal piece of filmmaking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"To avoid fainting keep repeating, it's only a movie (add infinity)", so reads the tagline of this grim, gruesome and extremely notorious of B seventies horrors. Dreamt up by now legendary screen shock veterans Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham Last House on the Left (cool title) is a sick little tale, shot with documentarian realism, of rape, mutilation and bloody revenge set in a rural American countryside. The blood splatters just like in any decent horror then or now but, for me, the torture and humiliation inflicted on two young girls on the cusp of womanhood by Krug &amp; Company are what sickens the most about this film (although the penis munching scene makes me want to cross my legs each time I 'see it' - nothing is actually shown; the imagination making up the rest). As mentioned, the film is shot using a documentary style approach, making the viewer (voyeur?) watch on, close enough for the blood to splash the face but powerless to stop the violence being witnessed on screen. Craven actually takes the central idea from Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring (without the divine miracle ending) and so exposes a terrifying sub-strata of life that society at the time was not used, or ready to be exposed to but was lurking beneath the surface and occasionally reared it's ugly head (there's a bit of the Manson family in Krug's lot, dontcha think?) much like Tobe Hooper's Texas Chainsaw Massacre ? the only contemporary of this film. Last House caused incredible controversy, reaching fever pitch over here in the UK where it was banned by the brainless buffoons of the BBFC ? it being one of the more high profile 'Video Nasties'. Despite the hysteria dying down over the years, the dark cloud of censorship (which still refuses to relent even as I write this in 2011!) hung over Last House on the Left for many years. The film did see release but with cuts until just recently when it was released fully uncut and uncensored (finally). It remains a cult classic of modern horror cinema and remains a sadistic, vile and primal piece of filmmaking. Hard to believe now that this was the debut feature of Craven, the darling of mainstream horror in the '90s with the Scream trilogy but I guess we all gotta start at the bottom. Joking aside, I hold a deep fascination with underground horrors of the '60s and '70s and Last House does more for me than any Hostel or Saw big budget, glossy, 'torture porn' movie ever will. Trivia note: the score in this film is performed by none other than Krug himself, David Hess. Bonus: The new 3 Disc Ultimate Edition DVD features the whole movie uncut and contains over five hours of special features including the documentary Going To Pieces: The Rise &amp; Fall Of The Slasher Film which is really cool but has nothing to do with Last House on the Left!</fullReview>

The in-close, shaky-cam style of shooting combined with a purposely scratchy print gives the film a perverse home movie feel, like you're watching some shocking reel of film you picked out of your neighbor's trash. Also, I guess the movie comments on the post-hippy era and women's liberation, but if it does, those comments aren't terribly deep. Otherwise it's a disturbing and trashy exploitation movie, mostly meant for shock value. And while it succeeds there, let's not go crazy here, either -- it's not exactly a great piece of cinema on any level.</fullReview>

While it may have blazed some (ugly and distasteful) trails at the time it was made, by the time I saw it, the special effects for gore were pretty far down the path, so that wasn't anything new to me. What really hit me viscerally, and still did on re-viewing, was the sexual violence. This film goes (too far for comfort) for the gut-punch on rape, reveals the horror of it, even though it happens on our streets every day. Rape is truly a form of torture, and this movie doesn't pull many punches on that score. (Even though much of the sexual violence is done off-camera) It goes all the way, too, inasmuch as the worst indignity is to experience that horror, and then be murdered, so that one's last moments are, well...Ick.</fullReview>

The remake is gory and disturbing, and it's not as scary. This is one of Wes Craven's early movies, and he is really good at making horror very realistic-looking, especially A Nightmare on Elm Street, which is more supernatural. Overall, if you are craving an old style horror flick, then this is definitely one to check out because it has an indie feel to it, if you are looking for a cheesy gory slasher flick with not much of a plot, then look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very flawed remake, but definitely a genuinely shocking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's 70s updating of Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING takes the same story and adds a deranged twist of terror, gore, realism, and shock to create a horror classic. While the film doesn't hold up entirely well, it does have a very effective approach to it. This time, the girls are kidnapped, tortured, humiliated, raped, and finally murdered on their way to a rock concert. When the parents find the culprits, they proceed to murder them, HOME ALONE style.While I definitely can't say that this is a film that I love, I can say that it is quite effective. David Hess plays Krug very well. He's got the right amount of sleaze and grossness. I found the performances of all the criminals to be perfect. I also found the scenes of the girls in the woods to be incredibly brutal and suspenseful. I thought that those scenes were the most effective scenes in the whole film. As a horror film, THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT works.The problems I have mostly are in the second half, though I found the music score to be a bit more than just bothersome. A silent score would have been far more effective. I also found the scenes with the cops to be a bit meandering and annoying. The second half suffers from poor editing and a general lack of horror. I did like the death scenes, however. Those were done very well.The good outweighs the bad with this film and I do think that it is worth seeing, especially if you're a horror fan. If you can tolerate the cheapness, the low-budget problems, and the score, you will likely find this film to be one of the most realistic horror films of the 70s. Check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mixed feelings about The Last House on the Left (1972)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have very mixed feelings about this film. I get that is was very shocking and disturbing film, it sort of was because of the documentary feel it had, but that is also the reason why it fails. The script is very borderline good, has some bad moments, but has some very great lines. But the reason the film itself is not able to pull together is because of the direction, the editing, the music, the cinematography. I appreciate low budget films like these, The Blair Witch Project (1999) I consider to be the best horror film ever made. But even that film, even though it has the hand-held camera, is well made. Films can have this sort of camera-work and still be well made. The Last House on the Left (1972) is not. It did have some very disturbing scenes, to me the most effective were when the girls are in the woods. But when I am really getting into the film, the editing distracts me, and we cut to either the parents or some laughably bad police officers that I have no idea what their purpose was. Maybe Wes Craven thought we needed comic relief, but it did not work. I also think he added some upbeat 70s music in the film for comic relief, but again, does not work. Some of it did, but most of it did not. The acting is actually from horrible to really good. I thought the killers were very good (besides Junior), but the girls and the parents were bad. A lot of unnecessary scenes. This is Wes Craven's first film, but it is not his best. At the end of the day, I am disappointed because this had the story to be a Masterpiece, and in a way it sort of is, hidden really deep in itself. I appreciate it, and I respect what Craven was trying to do, but overall, it is not a very good film. It does have some eerie scenes, and for that, I will give it a rating of 7. Because, all in all, I will still not forget it, for all of it's originality and mediocreness. But to those who have heard why this film was so controversial back then, yes, it's true, but it is also true that it is not a Masterpiece. I cannot believe I am going to say this, but the 2009 remake is way superior. The only thing this film is better in is in some of the characters' fates, and the scene in the woods is more disturbing than any scene in the 2009 version. But the 2009 version is everything this was not, great performances, stronger screenplay, brilliant direction, cinematography, and editing. If you want to see why this film is so popular nowadays, see it, but for a really great film, see the 2009 version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was disturbing, disgusting, traumatizing, and had a realistic home-made feel to it that only added to its effect. I agree with some of the other comments that it's right up there with the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre in the way it messes with your mind.Now, I know that many horror movies have flimsy plot lines/stories, and that's part of the fun, but I really think Craven missed a chance to make this movie a truly great horror classic. If just a few things were done differently I think it would have made a big difference... The biggest example is the decision made by the parents to exact revenge on their daughter's murderers. How did these square, conservative country folks suddenly morph into torturers in their own right? The father setting up Home Alone-style traps for the killers around the home? The mother giving oral sex to her daughter's murderer, only to bite off the guy's you-know-what? I think there should have been a scene in which the parents sit and decide what to do, possibly even after hearing from Mari about all the disgusting torture that the killers inflicted upon her (apparently it was Craven's original plan to keep her alive long enough to do so). This would have explained the parents' motivation to not only kill, but also torture the convicts... At least a scene where they show that a switch has been flipped in the parents' minds which allows them to suddenly become the killers themselves. I'm picturing a breakfast scene taking place after the parents have been up all night plotting and becoming more and more crazily distraught, while the killers still have no idea they're onto them...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven went on to a terrific horror slasher career and became a master of the slasher horror, something I have been a big fan of for a very long time so it was with great interest that I picked up a copy of Last House On The Left. I can say two distinct things about this film. First of all...it is NOT a slasher flick or even a horror flick and it just barely borders a thriller. When all is said and done Last House On The Left is an early seventies exploitation film that easily pushes the boundaries of film vs gratuity. While the film is intense and watchable and I certainly enjoyed watching it from an entertainment perspective BUT I honestly don't think I'd ever watch it again on purpose. It just really doesn't have anything that would make one want to watch it again. In some ways the film is very timeless and could be relevant to situations nowadays in that kidnapping is very real and twisted and disturbing. Certainly the entire story and plot written by Wes Craven is entirely twisted in itself. The twist to the end of the story is horrifying to any parent or any person who has had a kidnapping situation relevant to them.The cast is solid enough and although there isn't well known talent involved they do a good job especially the kidnappers. Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham play the lead girls in the film. Young and wild and anxious to enjoy a night away at a concert but by being in the wrong place at the wrong time they are kidnapped by twisted, disturbed convicts. Both girls are taken on mostly to show gratuitous nudity and scream a lot but they do a decent job making you feel their emotions. Cassel never did anything but 70's exploitation films and Grantham never did anything else. David Hess, Fred Lincoln and Marc Sheffler are stand out performers in the film as the three male psychos who kidnap and torture and rape the two girls. Hess is brilliant as the leader of the crew, they really are perfect for their roles. Jeramie Rain plays the only female psycho Sadie. I think she is more of a figure head to not make this torturous situation, three guys ganging up on two innocent girls seem quite so bad and for that reason her role kind of works but she is pointless outside of that. She cackles and stumbles through a pointless character. Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr are decent as the Collingwoods, the parents of one of the missing girls who finds themselves face to face with their daughter's killers. They really show some great performance later in the film fighting back against them.The film has a really terrific pace. Everything happens at break neck speed and sincerely keeps you on the edge of your seat and is genuinely shocking. I don't think I'm easily shocked when it comes to films but there is something gritty and realistic about watching this film. The movie doesn't pour blood like something like Saw or Hostel so it might not seem like the same level of disturbing and yet there is something untapped and creepy about the way the film is shot. In my mind low budget makes a film far more creepy than having big special effects. When all is said and done if you are a horror buff or just love Wes Craven then chances are you need to see this film but it certainly won't be one you keep on your shelf for a rainy day and remaking it will be a joke although in all honesty I would certainly check it out because I am like that when it comes to "horror" remakes but it's a mistake to remake something like this. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The house where Mari lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Wes Craven's update version of the Ingmar Bergman classic "Jungfrukallan" or "The Vergin Spring" is about grieving parents, Dr. John Collingwood and his wife Estelle, who's daughter, Mari, was brutally murdered and what they ended up doing to her killers. In the movie The two parents end up taking brutal revenge on the drugged up psycho's who murdered and raped both their teenage daughter Mari and her best friend Phyllis in a night of unimaginable horrors.The film jumps from the idyllic and picturesque town of Westport Connecticut to the grimy streets and drug infested dens of the East Village in high crime New York City. Taking in a movie the two out of town girls, Mari &amp; Phyllis, get involved with this drugged out individual, Junior, thinking that he can sell them a once of Columbian grass. Junior takes the girls to his pad where their kidnapped and later raped and murdered, as well as tortured, by Junior's friends his criminal dad Krug Sillo, wanted in the murder of a priest and two nuns, and his partners in crime the serial peeping Tom Fred Weasel Podowski as well as the sadistic bull dike Sadie.Tying up the girls and driving out of the city the four murderous degenerates have them beaten and humiliated before savagely murdering and dismembering their bodies. As things turn out the fleeing killers end up, because of car trouble, in the very house that Mari lived in posing as a bunch of plumbing executives who got themselves lost in the woods. Taking in for the night by the kind hearted and friendly Collingwoods their daughters killers later find out what revenge really is all about. That's after Estelle finds her daughter's peace symbol necklace hanging around the neck of the barley conscious,due to his heavy drug abuse, Junior. It's even later when Estelle finds Mari's blood stain clothing in Krug's suitcase that she together with her husband Dr. John plan to justifiably take revenge against the entire slimy bunch in the same way that they murdered their daughter Mari and Phyllis; As brutal and painful as humanly possible!A cult classic that has gained new fans at every screening in the 1970's and is now among the top slasher movies of all times "Last House on the Left" still packs a wallop that's hard to duplicated, with top studio state of the art special effects, even in todays horror flicks. The sheer brutality of the murders of both Mari &amp; Phyllis comes across so realistic that the film had to put in a disclaimer to it's audience telling them "It's only a movie" in order to keep those watching from freaking out in the theaters.As savage as the murders of the Mari &amp; Phyllis were the retaliation by Mari's parents against their killers was almost as, if not more, as gruesome. The trio of killers with the exception of Junior, who was egged on by his dad Krug to do himself in, ended up getting their just desert after a night of being treated to Mrs. Estelle Collingwood's delicious, their last meal, spaghetti and meatball dinner. By the time the both bumbling sheriff and his deputy, who were used as comedy relief by director Craven, finally came on the scene their was not enough left of murderous psycho killers to be even be given a proper burial!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed debut for Craven, impressive in areas, terrible in others</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Last House on the Left" is one of the most remembered rape &amp; revenge flicks from the 70's, and certainly one of the most widely-seen. Of course, any shocker fan worth his/her salt would tell you that "The Last House on the Left", in spite of its reputation, is hardly the most violent or offensive film of its kind. In fact, I sort of respect Craven's handling of the torture, rape, and murder scenes. They are genuinely effective and to be honest very well-acted. Also, while the scenes are genuinely horrific (they involve forced urination and disembowelment, among other pleasantries), Craven's handling of them is good enough that they don't seem as exploitative, perverted, and downright stupid as most movies of this nature do, and they actually serve their purpose in the movie. See the 2005 remake of this movie, "Chaos", for utter idiocy and gore that goes well beyond the realm of what is needed in the film and treads the sick sexual fantasies of the directors and writers.What sadly does let "The Last House on the Left" down is the writing. It makes Craven's work as director here seem accomplished. The dialogue is almost uniformly bad, the comic relief with the cops (and a horrifyingly unsuitable musical score) is not only superfluous but essentially ruins the film, and the final scenes of the film are... how should I put this, less than captivating 'drama'.Not really a horror film as much as Craven's attempt to bring Bergman's "The Virgin Spring" into the context of the 1970's 'rape and revenge' genre, and no points for guessing which is the more accomplished film, "The Last House on the Left" was a promising debut for Craven but it is a shoddy film in many respects and is severely let down by its script.Undeniably, however, this film holds a visceral fascination and is an essential 'must-see' film. Bizarrely, in spite of its many flaws, it is an engaging and atmospheric thriller, and while not entirely successful, somehow manages not to be bad at all.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two young girls decide to go to the big city for a concert, and get abducted by three escaped convicts and one of their helpers. Soon they're thrust into a world of hell as they struggle to stay alive.This was Wes Craven's directorial debut, and you can clearly see from this first film that he would be one of the great horror movie directors of all time. His use of gore, depravity and helplessness is positively stirring.Many people today see movies like "Saw" and "Hostel" as the first of the torture films, but "Last House on the Left" definitely set the bar with some of their torture scenes, which were done extremely well for 1972.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To avoid fainting, remember, it's only a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out fairly poorly with a few silly scenes and some cheese-ball acting. Then comes the scene where the two young girls, who seem to be the leads of the film, get kidnapped by a gang of thugs lead by their leader, Krug. Suddenly there's a little tension in the film. Then, of course, we get to the scene in the woods. This scene takes the movie from semi-cheesy horror film to something unique. The pure violent rawness of the scene is effective. I won't say what happens besides that one of the girls is forced to urinate in her own pants and eventually the two girls are made to kiss each other. Not such cheerful stuff but you can feel the tension of the two frightened girls effectively. The best performance in the film comes from David Hess as Krug. There is strong acting throughout but not by everybody. It's hard to say much more about the story without giving stuff away. When this movie was first released it had two different titles, one being "Krug and company", and the other "Sex Crime of the Century" which producer, Sean Cunningham (of Friday the 13th fame) came up with and thought would make the movie a hit. Anyway, the movie flopped big time. Then someone came up with the title, "Last house on the left", which had nothing to do with the plot, and a slogan which declared "To avoid fainting, keep telling yourself, it's only a movie, it's only a movie...". These two adjustments attracted tons of customers and suddenly the movie was a hit. Funny what a little clever slogan can do. Good Stuff!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 70's Horror Exploitation Movies ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not even the bad music and comic relief can hurt one of the best Horror/Exploitation movies of the 70's. Before "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "I Spit on Your Grave", and "Cannibal Holocaust" added a documentary like realism to their proceedings, Wes Cravens debut (a loose adaptation of Bergman's "The Virgin Spring") did just that. The plot itself is simple: Two girls on their way to a concert are humiliated, tortured, raped, and murdered by a gang of thugs. Later, the thugs take refuge in a house-which just happens to be the home of the girls parents. However, unlike other revenge movies like say, "Death Wish", there is no satisfaction to the ensuing vengeance. The viewer is instead left feeling empty and horrified, as the movie essentially deglamorizes on screen violence, showing the general ugliness and pointlessness of violence. Oh, and let's not forget Krug. While Freddy may be more popular, Krug is Craven's scariest villain IMO. He's not a supernatural villain who haunts you in your dreams, he's not a cyborg best pal, he's not a man who controls the dead. He is human evil personified; a villain who feels all too real. That is scarier than Freddy and Jason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece exploration of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left" is a masterpiece exploration of violence, and what it does to the human soul.This movie contains many a classic scene. The Krug-orders-Phillis-to-urinate-scene. The messing-with-organs-scene. The Mari-walks-into-the-water-and-gets-shot-scene. Not for the faint of heart! This movie is all about animal instinct. It could be argued that Krug, 'Weasel', and Sadie just follow their natural instincts. Killing, hunting, and playing with the victim are human instincts that are largely neglected in civilization today. All civilized thought patterns aside, is it healthy to neglect this side of ourselves.Craven does fail in the largely unnecessary comedic scenes, which seem hopelessly out of place. Most likely in the movie to counterweight for the violence scenes, their only success is tearing apart some of the terrifying atmosphere established by the aforementioned scenes.This is, however, not enough to destroy an otherwise fantastic movie. "The Last House on the Left" was probably the first movie to seriously explore the depths of the human soul via violence. Perhaps this is the success of the movie. It casts light on instincts we had pleasantly forgotten. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>And you... are... Alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As probably says above, please, if you don't want to spoil this movie, don't read this commentary... here i describe some important things for the plot.Wes Craven has created one of the most famous characters in the horror cinema history, Freddy Krueger and made "A Nightmare on Elm Street", which, for me, one of the most original horror fantasies in the 80s. Then he made "Scream", which have 3 parts, and too direct the seven part of the "NIghtmare" series (The original and this semi kind of sequel are the only effective in the series). In the present, he made a serial of horror movies, without count with the drama starring by Meryl Streep "Music of the Heart". But before of all this, he made "The Last House on the Left" ... a movie that was and is attacked as repulsive, disgusting and sick."The Last House on the Left" told us the story of two girls. Mari Collingwood, who birth just 17 felt like a woman for the first time. At the same day, 2 fugitives who are dangerous scape from where their intern. Mari lived in the last house on the left, far from city. Mari and Phylliys, her other friend go to a bad famed neighborhood for some grass, they asked to one man ... They don't know the error that commits. "The Last House on the Left" is first of all, a confusing movie, but most of all, a shocking one. "The Last House on the Left" was in that and still in our own time, a polemic movie, with followers and haters. I don't think that this movie can called as excellent, and great, but i have it an admiration, because this is a powerful film, that i actually find terrible and repulsive, but not so disturbing as much say. "The Last House on the Left" is based in a film years before by Ingmar Bergman called "The virgin Spring", which plot is very similar, only that is located in a different time and location.Much says about that this is a repulsive film and sick film and much says that this is one of the best horror pieces ever. This two ideas go wrong and is about and idea: This is not none of that things... "The Last House on the Left" is a shocking and powerful drama.But "The Last House on the Left" have some mistakes that make that we don't get the real objective of its creators and at the same time this get confused and make that much judge too fast this movie. The plot have include with it some funny characters (Two cops) and that makes lose any seriousness. Another mistake is the develop of some things, for example in the last part of the movie, the development of the feelings of the mother and the father is not know for us at all. And the movie then come so quickly after the climax... Well, could be much better in this point. Other important point is the confuse objective of this movie. Was really created by Craven and producer Sean S. Cunninham (The future director of "Friday the 13th, for that reason this make me doubt) for make only sick people? It was a sensationalistic piece with no any meaning more than disgust (As "Cannibal Holocaust" for example)? The only thing that supports this idea is the first title apparition which tell us that "The Story is based on true events" thing that i don't think that is true. But "The Last House on the Left" can have one different objective after all: The fright of real monsters. The fright of the pain of a person that we love so much. The idea of revenge (Manage too in "Carrie" and "Irreversible"). So, this is the reason of why this film should not be judged so quickly. Why appreciate this film in the end? Is because the film is not so sensationalistic as much going to think, if the intention was make a real fright about real monsters, this movie get it. I think that after all, the movie is graphic, but not so much for say that Craven was making a disgusting film and that its creator is sick. I think that if Craven wants to make tremble of fear in an intelligent way, he get it. I think that this is more a psychological horror drama full of a coldness air. And in spite of that terrible mistakes, this is a movie that should be seen and take slowly. Always get fast in opinions makes that we say things that don't go with it. A thing that support this idea is the music, which was made by Alexander Hess (Who played the evil Krug). The songs is one of the few vehicles to makes know to us the real feelings of the characters ("Wait for the Rain" describes the upcoming storm for a father and a mother). The folk music is wonderful and terrific, although that sometimes is bad used when a kind of funny music is put it in wrong scenes (When they kidnapped the girls put a kind of clown music... the only reason that i can found for this is that could be a cynical message, if the villains feels happy for their new criminal adventure)."The Last House on the Left" is destinate to be a film which cause controversy and each viewer going to take it good or bad, as they think what was the real objective. I have seen the capacity of Craven to do films, and i support him (Althoug that i have read somewhere that he feels how hard have been this film). Is after all a powerful horror drama, almost impossible to forget.*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My girlfriend thought I was watching 70's porn, which admittedly the film does resemble at times. It's basically a remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring, accept the rape and torture are the centerpiece's, the revenging parents far more sadistic, and the religious message eliminated. Light seventies folk pop dominates as the score which gives the film an eerie detachment as do the constant edits between the mundane activities of sheriff and parents to those of the victims in the woods nearby. The acting is poor, the story obvious, leaving only the violence which is extremely graphic even by modern standards. Whether or not this is enough to make the film watchable is a matter for the tastes of horror fans to decide. Personally I found the whole thing a bit anti-climatic, the fight scenes being particularly poorly staged. Still an important film in the history of horror, but aside from buffs, scholars, and sadists, there's not too much worth watching here for the casual viewer. Of course if your a little of all three this film is one to watch, especially for those jaded horror fans who feel they've seen it all. Rob Zombie owes a great deal to this film especially in his "The Devil's Rejects", which is, still in fairness, a much better film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing but playful, Brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen plenty of horror films, thriller films, ghost,alien, murder and monster films. From 'The hills have eyes' to 'Signs' and 'White noise' and nothing yet has managed to really chill me to the bone. Until now, this film is brilliant, it maintains typical Hollywood traits in a subtle way and yet presents scenes, that as an 18 year old girl, reflects my worst nightmare. Despite the fact that the film is rather poorly made and has some of the worst acting I've ever seen, it manages to present serial killers and cold blooded murderers in an unglamourous and truthful way. It has an element of humour that is laced in with the film in a way that makes people think 'What the hell am I watching?' but it somehow works to keep the audience watching and takes the edge off the seriousness of the film. The slapstick that purposefully or not seems like a send up of British humour in the 70s like the 'Carry on' films is another reason why this film is extremely out of the ordinary and different to any film I've ever seen. It even comes with a moral to the story! Don't do drugs! contradictory to the fun loving nature of the 70s! All in all this strange, almost forgotten film which was once banned in a few places for its stark and blunt approach to murder is brilliant. Wes Craven is fantastic, although this film seems like a failure at first, look past the terrible filming and the lack of SPFX and remember it was made in the 70s so be realistic in your expectations and enjoy it for what it is, a disturbing but playful 70s thriller flick!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reviewing this movie in 2007 is going to get it a lot of bad reviews, but go back to when this one was released and get into that mentality. I graduated in 1973 and this movie was really cutting edge back then, everyone was talking about it in school. How many movies did you see back then where a guy gets his penis bit off while being blindfolded with his tie? Answer: None. It was a low budget movie absolutely, but it was definitely pushing the envelope as you just didn't see this stuff in a movie back then. Movies that are rated R now were rated X back then. I watched Flesh Gorden in a theater and it was rated X. This was really a cutting edge that featured gore, rape, etc.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The infamous "Last House On The Left" which is directors Wes Craven's first outing. It's easy to see why this movie caused a lot of controversy back in 1972 because to be honest you have to have a sick mind to think up an idea like this, I'm not saying that this is a bad movie but it's something that you can watch over and over again especially if you have a weak stomach.The story line is about 2 young girls Mari and Phyllis travels to the big city to see a rock concert but are stopped in they're tracks by Krug and his crew and end up being kidnapped, tortured, raped and even murdered.After watching this movie seeing a pair of likable teens going through a long process of being tortured and raped was unsettling and I definitely saw the raw emotion and it's powerful effect and sense of realism, knowing that this can really happen which is frightening and disturbing.As it's Wes Craven's first film he was definitely spot on at creating something that shocked the world and making his mark in Hollywood and at the same time nearly ruined his career, but gladly it didn't. I wouldn't say this is his best movie, to be honest he's made some great movies such as (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The People Under The Stairs and Scream) and even some bad ones such as (Deadly Friend, The Hills Have Eyes 2 and Cursed), well even great directors can't get it right every single time, but I'd say he got it right with this one, but it's not one of his best because it's so disturbing. The actors are dead on in this movie, the 2 girls Sandra Cassel (Mari) and Lucy Grantham (Phyllis) were both believable and gave ballsy performances, David Hess (Krug) is amazing as the murderous leader. His calmness gives an extremely scary performance, very effective, Fred J Lincoln (Weasel) is perfect casting, he looks like a weasel, a charming one at that. Love that jackknife bud. Jeramie Rain (Sadie) plays the sick twisted bisexual killer perfectly and Marc Sheffer is excellent as Junior, the heroin addicted youth.All in all I'd say a very ambitious first effort from the great Wes Craven.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb slice of extreme 70s low-budget horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When pretty birthday girl, Mari, and her friend, Phyllis, try to score some weed on the way to a concert, they fall prey to a gang of scumbags (being hunted by the police) who torture and kill the teens. After their car breaks down, the murderous lowlifes (posing as travelling insurance salesmen) seek refuge at a nearby house which, by sheer coincidence, belongs to Mari's parents. Mari's mother discovers the truth about her guests, and she and her husband plot their revenge.One of the most infamous horror movies of the 70s, The Last House on the Left is a truly brutal and shocking tale of murder and retribution. It may be an indisputably nasty movie?director, Wes Craven, packs his sleazy tale with torture, rape, and violent death?but it is also an extremely effective one, managing to realistically portray the abhorrence of murder and the depravity of those who commit the crime.By contrasting the extreme violence with scenes of lowbrow humour, Craven also manages to pull off rather a neat trick, managing to make the horror even more difficult to handle: the sight of a teenage girl being repeatedly stabbed seems so much worse when preceded by a scene featuring bumbling cops falling off the roof of a truck!Even though the gore is kept to a minimum, this movie features several scenes guaranteed to sicken even the most hardened of horror fans. With one of the bad guys carving his name into poor Mari's chest before raping her, and Phyllis almost managing to escape before being stabbed to death, this is not an easy film to stomach. However, those seeking out a genuinely compelling and taboo-breaking piece of film-making would do well to check out this classic of extreme cinema.Wes Craven's finest moment? Quite possibly...</fullReview>

This is a snuff movie nonetheless. Girls being raped beat tortured. The movie is filled with dread and hopelessness. Whoever could actually sit through something like this more than once certainly isn't quite like other people in society. In other words, why would you WANT to watch two young girls being raped and beaten, unless you get some sick perverted thrill from it. I personally thought the movie sucked, the acting sucked, and it was a really retarded horrible attempt at making a movie. Again, this is not horror. This is snuff-like and should NOT have been released at all, period.</fullReview>

Along the way they meet up with a group of 4 convicts led by Krug (David Hess) who kidnap them and take them to the woods that is only 100 metres or so from Mari's house. They then humiliate, torture, rape and kill them. The gang then go the Collingwood's home to stay. But Mari's parents soon find out about what they did and plot their own brutal revenge....Last House on the Left is Wes Cravens first low-budget horror. It's disgusting and at times horrible to watch. But it isn't the most violent horror movie I've seen. The major problem was that there were a few major annoyances that really spoilt the mood of the movie.One was the very annoying music that played throughout. It didn't set up a good mood or a sense of dread, it just made the scene seem like nothing. Another was the added comic elements that really broke the mood, which although weren't too distracting, were not funny and annoying. The acting was passable and Wes' direction is perfect.I would recommend this to the hardcore horror fans. But I warn anyone that is curious, this movie is depressing and very brutal.3/5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven delivers a wallop with this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hold on to your hats, ladies and gentlemen! You're in for one hell of a ride. This isn't just a movie that you decide to pick up and watch because you're bored. This is one that takes some mental preparation before sitting down and viewing, because even in the blood-bathed cliché of horror movies these days (such as Hostel or See no Evil), The Last House on the Left is one of the dirtiest and most brutal films around, very much in the same league as some of the visceral Italian thrillers of the 70s and 80s (like The House on the Edge of the Park or The New York Ripper, only it's twice as good). Surprisingly enough, it was made by one of the now leading men of mainstream horror these days, Wes Craven, only it doesn't have the "Look how vile and depraved we're being!" attitude that's usually associated with heavy studio films (again, like Hostel or See no Evil). I think if remade by Craven today, it would have that attitude, just because of how awful mainstream horror is today and how the studio world slowly eats away at your brutal film making abilities (take his atrocity Cursed, for example). With this being his first film, Craven had no influence whatsoever, and with no limitations brought on by blockbuster Hollywood, he makes this sucker-punch of a movie which stays terrifying at the same time.Mari Collingwood and Phyllis Stone are two teenage best friends (though we're given the feeling that they've only known each other for a short while) who are out looking for a good time. Despite Mari's parents' concerns about Phyllis and her attitude, they let their daughter go with her to a concert (but she has a curfew, of course). The two forget about her parents' concerns and decide that to grab a little weed before heading off. Unbeknowst to them, however, the guy they try to score off of is the son of an escaped rapist/murderer, Krug Stillo, who's inside with his partner, Fred 'The Weasel' Podowski, and their new, lesbian add-on, Sadie. Well, being only a day free from the slammer, Krug and Weasel decide to get back to their bad habits with these two fresh, teenage victims. They immediately kidnap the two and subject them to their unpleasant sadism and force the girls to stay the night with them in their rundown apartment. Mari's parents become even more concerned when their daughter didn't arrive back the night before, but the two investigating officers tell them not to worry. Well, they should worry, because Krug's fun is just beginning. The next day, he and his group head into the woods and systematically rape, torture, and eventually murder the two girls, and as dusk approaches, they decide to crash at the nearest shelter, the Collingwoods' home...As I said before, The Last House on the Left is one of the most brutal movies ever made, but even so, it remains one of the scariest ever made. Some of the scariest movies deal with the premise that this sort of thing could actually happen, and Wes Craven builds a very realistic underworld in the small town in which this takes place, and it afflicts two teenage victims, who appear very similar to what is probably the film's largest audience. Craven presents this unpleasant reality in such an unflinching way that it almost feels like you're watching snuff, and though it has the same setup and presentation of the most typical and overly pretentious exploitation film, it's too well made to be exploitation. Adding to this foreboding atmosphere and pseudo-reality is the wonderful performance of the gang of murderers, David Hess in particular, who made started his horror film repertoire of psycho serial killers with this film. One must wonder if Hess ever had a run in with or grew up around such a crowd, because in every one of his performances, he plays his character with raw and frightening intensity, and this is no exception. And also like Hess's The House on the Edge of the Park, there's a villain who has an inner-conflict between his morality and his loyalty to his (this time) father, but in the spirit of the film's depressing atmosphere, he's no saving grace to Krug's cruelty and comes to a tragic end.The lone aspect that keeps Last House on the Left from perfection is the inclusion of the classic comic relief of the two bumbling officers who are searching for the escaped gang of convicts, comic relief that I've never had a place for. Unfortunately, they come across as necessary plot elements, and while it seems I tolerate their presence more than the next guy, I'll agree that their roles are no good. Other than that, Last House is a classic, non-exploitatious exploitation film that stands up to the test time in its brutal depiction of sheer terror and torment. Apparently, Craven was in the "flower-child" crowd in the 70s, and he made this as an anti-violent protest. And like Hess says, "How do you do that given the subject matter? You push the envelope." He certainly does here. And while it doesn't have the same extreme nature as other political statements like Cannibal Holocaust, it outdoes other raw horror films such as The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. Wonderful and terrifying performances enhance the viewing experience, and if one dislikes it for its violent nature, what were they doing watching it to begin with? It's definitely an endurance test, but try to stick with it. This is some real horror, people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sickness and savagery abound in Craven's realist grindhouse classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest with you this is probably one of the most brutal and disturbing mainstream films ever. "The Last House On The Left", one of Wes Craven's first movies, is about as nasty as realist horror gets. It is about two teen friends, Mari and Phyllis, who go out to celebrate Mari's birthday. While looking for some marijuana, they are kidnapped by a group of murdering bandits, are drugged, beaten, and taken out into the woods. These woods happen to be the same woods just 100 yards away from Mari's home. After brutally murdering both of the girls, they take refuge in Mari's parents' home, the parents unknowing of who the people are or what they did. When Mari's parents find out what they did to their daughter, they decide to take bloody revenge. Full of graphic images and in some ways clearly inspired by the cinematographic aspects of films like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre", "The Last House on the Left" has Craven at his most uncompromising and most brutal. The story is simple but well-written, and the characters are all uniquely shaped. The killers do terrible things to these poor girls, and you really feel sorry for them and wish that you could help, and their death scenes are absolutely horrendous. At one point one of the girls is forced to pee her pants? both are raped, forced to undress in front of the killers, and violently tortured until both of them meet their fates. Sound awful? It's beyond awful, it is downright sick. So why would I give this film such a high rating? Well, mainly because of how effective it is.The strongest thing about this film is that it feels so real, you could almost think it's really happening. "To avoid fainting, keep repeating, it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie" - that tagline still applies to this day, because this film is that "real". The voyeuristic stance that the film takes in presenting these events as they unfold leaves you wanting to take a shower because you feel so dirty and emotionally drained. In that sense, this film is an utter success? it's an extremely low-budget, stripped down production, but the DIY special effects rise above this, and the straightforwardness of the violence is gripping. The acting is also incredibly realistic, particularly from the girls. Apparently the film was heavily cut because of its intense violence, but the new MGM DVD release includes the uncut footage and additional scenes that weren't shown back in 1972. To sum it up, this movie was sick, but in a good way. It's not the most pleasant way to spend 90 minutes, but this is a downright disturbing horror film, and therefore I have to give it a high rating - it is truly a landmark film in terms of its ability to relay human savagery in such a straightforward manner. It's an excellent movie and is a constant reminder of the wonders of low-budget cinema. If your idea of a brutal, realistic horror movie is Craven's "Scream", you'll be shocked at what he braved over two decades before that. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wasn't what I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must have seen a slightly edited version, because the scenes involving the carving on the chest, the disembowelment and the forced lesbian sex were basically left out (I'm not too sure if the original version is available). But even without those gory scenes, it was a lot more watchable than I thought. Yes, I would agree that watching the convicts taunt and bully the girls was effectively shot, tense and gripping. I would disagree that it was shocking or repulsive, maybe that is down to me being de-sensitized to horror movies. It was however, finely directed by Craven. He did a superb job in making the convicts appear evil, physcotic, cruel and absolutely remorseless...apart from the younger lad who was shown as being 'dragged along' by his elders. I thought the music was often ill-fitting to what was happening on screen, and the comedy thrown in was sometimes confusing ( the 2 policeman arguing with Ada the truck driver). But that may well be Craven's style, to throw you off balance and keep you watching. For me the best part was when the parents clock on to who their 'guests' really are, and set about a gruesome revenge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing. . .but is it horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An early effort from future horror-meisters Wes Craven (A Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream) and Sean Cunningham (Friday the 13th), The Last House on the Left is a disturbing, unsettling, and gritty film. Taking its cues from Bergman's The Virgin Spring, Craven's film tells the tale of two young girls on their way to a concert. On the way back, they try to "score some pot" from a young man. He takes them to his apartment, which doubles as the hangout for his father's gang (more on that in a moment). The rest of the plot is incidental, and everyone is more or less familiar with it. We all know the ending of the film, as well--the parents of one of the young girls discover that the travelers they are playing host to are the same people who brutalized their daughter, so they exact their equally brutal revenge.What matters here is not the story, nor the gore, nor the sorry excuse for comic relief (a pair of bumbling cops); nor is it the hokey music (composed by David Hess, who plays the gang's leader Krug) and terrible dialogue. It's the subtext: the horrors of Vietnam, of Kent State, of the napalm attacks at My Lai--they are all played and replayed out before our eyes. It's the thought of people suddenly and almost inexplicably snapping, their mental facilities broken by some tragedy.It's the feeling that this could happen to you. Or me.If this is a horror film, it's nothing like the horror films we're used to. There is no masked boogeyman with a knife. There is no supernatural element to haunt us. There is only us. Humans. People with emotions who make rash decisions and either regret them, or have second thoughts about them (as the gang seem to do in this film more than once), or try to get out of the situations based on their decisions. It's a heartless film. It's hard to watch. It's painful and gruesome and pretty damn awful.Is it a true horror film? You decide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For 6 quid at Music Zone I was pleased I got it at such a good price, as a double DVD this will most likely keep me ammused watching all the extras that come with the discs. So okay first things first. I didn't think it was a bad film on any level, it just wasn't what I expected. The main thing I thought when watching this is something that reminded me of the torture scene in Reservoir Dogs. When watching it the music was cheesy and very country and Western but I did start tapping my foot to it. Then it occoured to me. I am enjoying this film, I am enjoying this music, but the situation is sick. It does take the horror genre to a new place. It does show that unlike Scream killers don't always go around in masks.As the film carried on I won't deny I wasn't impressed. The main thing that shocked me was when one of the characters who had an ounce of humanity is told to turn a gun on himself and kill himself. I really felt sorry for him. He was a little crazy granted but considering he was pump on goof-balls he wasn't wanting to take part in it. He was disgusted as much as the audience were.Watch it, rate it, enjoy it if you wish but I was not as impressed as I hoped I would be. I preferred TCSM.</fullReview>

I rented this today as I am on a Wes Craven kick having watched Hills Have Eyes this past weekend.This film is disturbing and it looks like Rob Zombie's DEVILS REJECTS will be in the same tradition as this film was back in the 70's. I love the grittiness of the film and also the soundtrack.NOW SOME SPOILERS Things that bothered me while I watched it again is that one of the girls had a chance to escape but instead wasted her time talking to Junior.Also the mother giving one of the sickos fellatio made absolutely no sense. Why would she do that? I was expecting her to rip it off with the zipper but she actually went down on him - now that is just stupid.Overall this movie is good for what it was in this time period. Most disturbing movie I have ever seen? No. Check out THE UNTOLD STORY to see some sick flick - if you are into that. I stomached it once - that was it.</fullReview>

I liked that it was very strange, but it was still creepy. The scenes of rape and killing almost looked real and sent shivers down my spine. It was good acting, but in some parts you wonder about it because people in the movie act like they are just trying to remember their lines. I wouldn't want to watch it again, but I would recommend it for people who haven't seen it. It's one of those movies that you should see in your lifetime.

		<fullReview>Okay, so normally, I hate exploitation films. I've been through some trauma, and I hate reliving it. King of the Ants. Superb exploitation film. It had me on the floor, curled into a fetal position, looking for my "happy place." It was a wonderful movie which I hope to NEVER see again.Last House on the Left was this same kind of movie. It features abduction; rape; murder; psychological abuse; drug abuse; physical abuse; stabbing; dismemberment by chainsaw; dismemberment by knife; electrocution; forced g/g sexual acts; forced urination; suicide by a head shot; disfigurement; castration; and multiple sexual partners.When this movie was released, it was a more gentler age than today. Kids were literally puking in the theaters, passing out, and becoming traumatized by the material in this film. They devised a mantra, "It's only a Movie, It's only a Movie..." to keep everyone who watched it, centered and focused in the here and now, rather than burying themselves in the horror of this film. A necessary step for a society who was less jaded; and even some people today.The performances featured herein were gritty, realistic, and natural. Craven's documentary style lent to this work a specific realism which made it seem more like you were there watching it, or watching it on the news, rather than subscribing to the Mantra. It was highly provocative (in a BDSM kind of way), and yet at the same time, repugnant. Lines were crossed and bells were rung.No opportunity for villainous behavior was lost, making this a highly disturbing work.This film was not a "masterpiece of horror," but it was a beauty of a little exploitation film, and has the virtue of being Wes Craven's very first. This is the movie that got Craven's director's cherry, as it were. *lol* This is not meant to be "scary." It was meant to disturb you; to crawl into your brain and make you react, however that reaction manifests itself. I must say, it definitely succeeds in its goal.This is a sure one for the collection, even if you're like me, and plan to NEVER watch it again.It rates a 9.2/10 on the "B" scale.That's a 7.4/10 on the "A" scale from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the film has little gore / blood and has no monsters or supernatural beings like a Jason / Freddy / Mike Myers, the Last House on the Left remains one of the scariest films in its genre. 2 young and very innocent teenage girls decided to buy some 'weed' and end up falling pray to a group of "bad kids." The horror of the innocent becoming victims is the core of the movie. If not the corruption of drugs, the peer pressure / the influence of a few bad apples causes the destruction of good. More of a drama until the final 1/3 of the movie, the movie deals with (what may have been a true story) the kidnapping, raping and then the killing of the two girls. Once the parents have their revenge, the movie is far from anything of a horror movie, especially for 1972. The movie is a low budget triumph as equal to the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. The movie was something the horror audience had never seen before. 30 years later, it has become a classic.</fullReview>

I recognized one actor, Martin Kove, as the comic relief and let me tell you if you're lucky, you may chuckle once. The only redeemable thing about this movie is the fact that things like that and worse have happened to girls and I found myself routing for their escape.

		<fullReview>I heard about this movie from various sources, all of them telling me the movie was banned for its explicit content. So, when it was finally released on DVD, I took the oppurtunity to rent it, and watch it. As the end credits rolled, I was left feeling abused, unsettled and very upset. The movie assualts the viewer with highly disturbing images.The story involves our two teenage girls heading off to a rock concert. Deciding they need a little pot to get the evening going with a swing. However, they go to the wrong place, and end up finding the hide out belonging to 4 insane criminals, who decide to capture the girls, and subject them to some of the most heinous things imaginable. Both the girls are raped, tortured, and then brutally murdered. The film has that grainy hand held camera effect, which made "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (1977) so scary and unsettling. As you witness the rape and killing, there is a sense of realism, which makes it all the more unbearable to watch. After the senseless violence and gratuitious nudity, the 4 psychopaths seek refuge in a nearby house, which unbeknownst to them, belongs to one of the murdered girls parents. Naturally, the parents find out what happened, and meticulously calculate their revenge, and dispatch the crooks in some gruesome ways. The one that sticks out clearly in my mind is the mother and the lead criminal (Hess) who disappear out in the garden for some "extra-curricular" activity, and she bites "something".The movies brutality is somewhat lessened however, by the introduction of the cops. Both are bumbling, and mostly appear to give a comedic performance.For Wes Craven's first major feature, he hasn't done a too bad job. This movie paved the way for Craven's other horror flicks, however this movie is original, ingenious and worth watching at least once. However, the movie did upset me, and I couldn't watch it again. But if you can handle mindless brutality and sexual violence, this movie is for you. 2 out of 5 stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have heard quite a lot about this movie and I've been wanting to watch for quite some time. Finally, it was released on dvd in Greece and when I saw it on the self of the dvd store I rented it. I was eager to see what all the fuss was about and I put the disc in the dvd player, sat comfortably on the couch and prepared myself to be blown away. Unfortunately, I was extremely disappointed. Not so much from the movie itself, but from the fact that the version I watched must be the most heavily cut version in existence. It was totally butchered, almost every scene was cut. I was left feeling I didn't watch the actual movie, just some selected parts. So, I don't really think I can properly review this movie, but I'll try to anyway.It is obvious that the budget was very tight and that Craven and Cunningham were not very experienced. The script is sometimes corny and even stupid, the direction and editing fail to impress and the music (composed by D. Hess who plays Krug, the main bad guy) is average at best. The acting, with the exception of D. Hess, is typical B-movie acting, although at some points the 2 girls look really scared. The main story is rather good - as far as revenge flicks go - but it could be better if some more attention was given to it. The cops, obviously meant as a comic relief detract from the movie. On top of all this, the version I watched was deprived of anything shocking, at least visually. So, with the main attraction of the movie gone, was it any good? Well, I can only speak for myself, but I'd have to say yes. Admittedly it's a badly made film, but I liked it. Even though the version I watched had almost none shocking or violent scenes, I still found it disturbing. Mostly because all the violence comes not from monsters, zombies, or super strong mutated killers, but from real people (from Krug's gang or from the parents). Krug and company do what they do without any motive, just because the can - just for fun, and the parents turn to killers for revenge. It was a strong movie and it stays with you for a while. As a conclusion, this movie has some flaws and it is definitely not a masterpiece, but as Craven's debut I think it's decent enough. Worth watching at least once, if only to see why it earned cult status.P.S. I cannot believe that in 2004 a movie gets released in such a heavily censored form. I feel cheated and insulted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film when video had only just become commercially available. And of course the likes of The Exorcist, Texas chain saw massacre, the various zombie movies, were the format's biggest takers, aside from the Oscar winners which everyone rented. I was living at home, and watched the majority of these films with my family and friends. I also have to admit that I got more entertainment watching the reactions of whomever was with me. &gt;From around this time, the schlock/horror/slasher movies, became so popular that I personally think that people became desensitised by what was going on and murder,rape,cannibalism etc, was the norm, (so to speak). I've just been to my local supermarket and seen that LHOTL has been released on DVD, and felt compelled to write this. It sent a chill, but also a morbid curiosity to view it again (at the tender age of 42). Having said that, this and the aforementioned movies did affect me in a way and I find that nowadays I actually enjoy a good psychological thriller or even mild slapstick comedy. Anything that remotely resembles this movie, that may involve that sort of violence does not appeal to me anymore. I was not even curious about the new Texas chainsaw film. Watch this film and think to yourself, "are there really people like that in this world of ours, and what makes them do the things they do)? Repeating to yourself,"this is only a movie" is one thing, but I defy anyone not to get up out of their seat and want to push the two girls in the opposite direction. Only then there would'nt have been "THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT" Thanks for your time reading this, who knows I may have exorcised a few demons of my own...............</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a bit better than the other comment suggests, and that's why it's been banned in several countries.Firstly, the rape scenes are not as bad as "Spit." There is one brief scene, and it's tastefully done, compared to the acts of sodomy in the other movie.This is definitely better than Craven's "Hills" movie, simply for the fact it's not "gore in your face" type atmosphere where the camera makes you look at the disgusting scenes. You can choose to look away, or admire the special effects.David Hess, in the 70's, was infamous for the "rape" style movies and impeccable gore/murder scenes. Most of the movies he is the lead character in, is like a Grease style clothing theme that meets ungodly gruesome and grotesque sick humor.This is not a movie to sit down with a first date, if you like shocker type films. This is what I would call an independent or "foreign" film, as it depicts the style of Fulci, Argento, and various other gruesome twosomes.The earlier films by Craven are wholesome in horror, much more than the ones produced today as they are realistic and reality based. Not your regular "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th" style slash, but enough to jolt your "real world".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The version of the film that I saw was the British DVD version which is missing about 34 seconds that were cut by the censors.The film's plot is a very loose reworking of the 1960 Ingmar Bergman film "The Virgin Spring". Here we have two teenage girls on their way to a rock concert. On the way there, they are kidnapped and tortured by a group of degenerate escaped criminals.The movie features the debut of celebrated horror film director Wes Craven (creator of "A Nightmare on Elm Street" and "Scream") and was produced by Sean S. Cunningham (who went on to create "Friday the 13th"). However, there is very little artistry in this film. The script is terrible, with dialogue stating the completely obvious and characters behaving in the most stupid way imaginable, and coincidences are stretched to breaking point. The music (by David Hess, who also plays the leader of the villains) is often laughable (you cannot make scary or atmospheric music using kazoos!) One of the worst aspects of the film, though, was the often wildly inappropriate comedy relief that was thrown in.Much of the film's plentiful violence is off screen (although how much was intentional and how much due to the whims of the British censors is debateable). There are moments though, when the film does seem to almost rise above its limitations. The violence is often shocking and brutal. It is not glamorised at all. There are moments where the perpetrators of the violence seem themselves shocked at what they've done. Shot on an obviously miniscule budget, the film sometimes has a quasi-documentary feel which actually makes it a little more effective.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is stylish and skilfully photographed, but Wes Craven's terror debut is without a distinct style and poorly photographed, so the experience of watching it is not as visceral. Still, it packs a punch.The film is notorious for its scenes where thugs sexually abuse two innocent women. The notoriety is understandable in context for these scenes are reasonably confronting and raw. But because LAST HOUSE is not the stylish document TEXAS is, the violence is probably harder to take for some.Although sexual violence is more harshly essayed in Japanese (violent pink) films like Hasebe's ASSAULT: JACK THE RIPPER and Ohara's ZOOM UP: RAPE SITE, it's inconceivable that those films would ever play the American mid-West as LAST HOUSE did.The film is well acted and, though not a literary masterpiece, the dialogue is natural. The storyline is slim but serviceable and exists to frame various atrocities. The sequence in which one of the women is ordered to "piss your pants" is perhaps the film's R-rated apex.It's been said that an angry young Wes Craven made this film in response to the Vietnam war, but I'm not sure about that. LAST HOUSE is clearly intended to shock and disturb, and it does so, in my opinion, almost by default because of its low budget origins.Worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like the digital polish of recent horror movies you will likely find "The Last House on the Left" crude and amateur-like. By today's standards and budgets this is true. It's this very quality, however, that makes it a horror gem.Shot in 16mm on a shoestring budget LHOTL has an eerie, reality-TV feel as you watch it. The killers are horrible because there are no smug one-liners or scary movie cliches. They are mortal and they make mortal mistakes. Krug is one scary character because the docudrama style of the film makes him more realistic. His crimes are hideous and we see the victims suffer horrible deaths. Not at all pleasant to watch because deep down the viewer knows this type of crime could really happen.The complete edition on DVD is fantastic with restored graphic footage cut upon its initial release. The extras are the real story as you find out that Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham are intelligent filmmakers who knew what they were doing with this movie. They wanted to shock and terrify.It's also interesting to hear the interviews with the cast members and hear of their initial disgust with the script.Sure, LHOTL may look crude and a bit silly at first glance. But do yourself a favor and watch the reissue at night with the lights out and see if it doesn't get under your skin just a little bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I must say, I love this film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I understand why many people find this film to be really disturbing, but I must say, I get a kick out of this film every time I watch it. I absolutely love Krug and his band of psychos.I will admit the first time I saw this movie it bothered me a little, but after watching it a second and third time, I decided that it was actually rather silly. I must say, I get a kick out such lines as "P*** your pants," and the dreadful '70s score (all written by David Hess, Krug himself).This movie is a lot of fun if you are a slasher buff that can handle just about anything. It is very graphic, but very entertaining. A classic in the realm of the sick and twisted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many ?banned' films LHOTL's reputation exceeds it's actual content. The film is disturbing, the rape and torture scenes are unsettling, however the way the shots are composed leaves much of the unpleasantness to the imagination. The acting is amateurish but that result's in a sense of realism that in hand helps the sense of realism. The slapstick music is uncomfortably juxtaposed with the violence, much like ?A Clockwork Orange', which does make LHOTL more disturbing. This isn't the film I hoped it would be, while it is a raw and unnerving piece of work it fails to pack the same punch as other horror films of it's time. A disappointing Craven film and a further sign that ?A Nightmare on Elm Street' is his best work. (I am yet to see ?The Hills Have Eyes').5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'm not sure what to think of this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film last night, and I can't seem to get it out of my mind. Knowing Wes Craven for his other works (Nightmare on Elm Street, Scream...etc.) I knew I had to see this film. It's Craven's first film, and it has a very low budget, obviously. I did like the story, and the actors gave very real performances, in my opinion. The camera work was messy at times, but it worked very well for this film. We are introduced to the two main characters (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham), who we really don't have much time to get to know. That's one weakness right there because later on, when the girls are being tortured by the killers, we don't really care about them. I think there is more of a connection with the killers, as we get to know them for better than the two victims. Yes, so more time could've been spent on the main characters before the actual encounter with the killers took place.I will admit that the rape and murder scenes in this movie are very intense, especially that last scene with Sandra Cassel. You really see how cold and heartless the killers are. And the irony of it all, these two girls were so close to getting help. I think the comic relief in this film was a bit much (the bit with the cops being utterly stupid about everything, and that awful soundtrack). Less music, or darker music, would've made the scenes intense and more disturbing. I agree with one comment, "silence is golden," and in this case it really is! The soundtrack completely ruined the seriousness of it all.Then when the killers stumble upon the home of one the victims, they have a big surprise waiting for them. I did like that idea, but again, the awful soundtrack ruined the mood and just made me laugh at the whole situation.This isn't a film for everyone. I don't suggest seeing it unless you're a hard-core Wes Craven fan. I'd give it a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A few diamonds in the rough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is hard to imagine now quite how shocking this film would have been on it's release, although by modern standards it is (in my opinion) now relatively tame.On the whole I thought the film was OK, if heavily flawed, but even so it is a remarkable first film for Wes Craven.There are many reviews which provide a synopsis of the file, so I do not feel the need to go over old ground. However, anyone who says this is a poor or perverse film must have been watching a different film to me.Although gratuitous and disturbing I did not feel that any of the scenes eroticised the treatment of the two victims, and I felt the degradation actually made me feel like a grubby voyeur placing the viewer in the helpless position of Jnr.In amongst the many poorly handled scenes there are a few striking moments that for me are some of the best in any film I have seen. The often cited `Hammer and Chisel' scene made me squirm in my seat, and my favourite scene was immediately after Mari's rape as we see the reaction of the gang to their acts of violence.Is this a great film, No, does it contain moments of greatness, yes indeed. This is a better film than I had expected, and although I can see why many people (including fans of extreme cinema) would not enjoy it. If you have the inclination to watch this film I would suggest you do so and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I noticed this DVD on the shelves at the local Blockbuster Store, the title first grabbed my attention (funny really when you watch the bonus features on the discs and realise how the title came about), and when i looked at the sleeve and noticed Wes Craven's name on it i thought "ahhh, must be worth look!"** POSSIBLE SPOILERS - TRYING NOT TO REVEAL TOO MUCH *** The story is pretty basic, some convicts escape from prison and take two teenage girls hostage and subject them to sexual and brutal torture, later the convicts stumble on the home of the parents of one of the girls, parents then realising what has happened attempt to take revenge.The film is disturbing despite some 30 years passing since it's original release. Even now the UK Censors will not give the film it's original uncut release and to be honest it may be just as well as it's pretty nasty stuff.The film has similarities with the likes of I Spit On Your Grave and Straw Dogs so you can imagine the sort of atmosphere you're in for.It's hard to comment on the acting skills of the amateurs that starred in this movie, it all seemed very real so i guess they pulled it off!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie again last night with someone who had never seen this movie before. The reaction to the film is almost always the same: It was disturbing. This was Wes Craven's first real film and if you are a fan of his work then you must see this film. If you are emotional however then do not watch this movie alone. This film starts out pretty much like any 70's film and has some bad acting to go with it. As the film moves on the acting gets better but the film gets more and more violent. This film shows some frightening acts of human insanity.A fan of horror will have this in their library of films. It is a true cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look. WARNING: POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Given the fact that it has was banned in the UK for 30 years and only just released on video and DVD in a cut version, it is still good to encounter a movie that you have waited ages to see. Admittedly, the resultant film does have equal good and bad points, but one thing you cannot say is that LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is one to see, regardless of what your opinion.I have to admit that it is more of a curiousity now and proves the effect that descriptive words like 'Controversial!!' and 'Banned!' and 'Notorious!' can have on a film and the expectation it creates. Like a lot of the early 70's films which focused on violence and the power it has (STRAW DOGS, CLOCKWORK ORANGE et al) it is not as harrowing and unbearable as you might think. Indeed, it was surprising to me to find a number of comical sequences (the parents preparing their daughters birthday party, the cops ineptitude at picking up obvious clues. Part of this is down to the low-budget, which at times does make the film look like a weekend vocational movie and the fact that limiting locations, if not used wisely, can show up the joins a bit more.Still, there are a number of scenes that still hold their power today and I will never look at a hammer and chisel in the same way again, as they provided the most jumpy shock moment for me in ages.</fullReview>

This is the worst movie ever. and that's counting Dungeons and Dragons...I watched the Jason X commentary (another bad movie) and they mentioned one of the scariest and most graphic movies of all time was Wes Craven's first movie, Last House on the Left. My friends and I searched video stores until we finally found a VHS copy(before it was released on DVD) and watched it....There's 90 minutes of my life I can never get back. A horrible music score accompanied this movie..so right after someone was raped in a horrible scene, you'd cut to the killers going down the road while a twangy country song called something like "Bonnie and Clyde" played and you just had to laugh at the ridiculity of it all. I guess next time I'll have to take into consideration how credible directors are when they give their opinion of scary movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(*** out of *****)--Spoiler Alert--Craven claimed that this, his first movie, was a loose remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring. While it's not quite as spiritually symbolic, cerebral, or subtle as the Swedish film, LHOTL is one of the most extreme, American-made exploitation classics of the ?70s. Along with The Exorcist, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and Halloween, it's probably one of the defining (and most copied) horror movies of that decade. It tells the story of two girls (Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham) who are kidnapped, raped, and murdered by a gang of escaped criminals when they try to buy dope from them while on the way to a concert. David Hess (The House on the Edge of the Park, Swamp Thing) forever doomed himself to despicable villain typecasting after playing the role of Krug Stillo, the sadistic rapist/killer who leads the violent gang of thugs. Fred J. Lincoln is also pretty slimy as Fred `Weasel' Podowski. The scenes in the forest are brutal and hard to watch, even in the American-released, edited version (I haven't seen the uncut version.) But, the `fun' really starts when the criminals unwittingly hole up in the house of one of the girl's parents (Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr). The most irritating (yet, at the same time, disturbing) aspect of this film is the cheesy, occasionally light-hearted music that plays over the matter-of-fact scenes of rape and torture and over the end credits. The bumbling, comic-relief cops (one of them played by Martin Kove, the evil karate instructor from the Karate Kid movies) are too out of place and inappropriate in a movie like this. Aside from these factors -- as well as an unlikely and overly elaborate revenge climax (honestly--shaving cream on the floor?) -- this movie, love it or hate it, stays with you afterwards. Craven's follow-up, The Hills Have Eyes, upped the body count and depravity (though in a less-realistic fashion) and included many of the same themes, but his films have gotten more watered down ever since (Music of the Heart, anyone?) Sean S. Cunningham, of Friday the 13th fame, was the producer.HIGHLIGHT: Kinda hard to identify a highlight in a movie like this, but the scene where the daughter is murdered, despite its cruelty and violence, is strangely beautiful and affecting -- a hint of powerful direction (which you don't see much from Craven).</fullReview>

Wes Craven is very critical of his work and honest in its appraisal. His interview gives a lot of insight into the production process of a horror movie, as well as, his personal growth in the industry. The commentary and extras are worth the cost of the rental.***Be warned*** this movie is unrated and goes much further than most horror movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My interest for The Last House On The Left began when I was reading some thematic books about the best and worst horror movies. Just the name of the film caught my attention, and what there was said about it really impressed me: kidnapping, torture, humiliation , rape, and murder. And all that in 1972, even before the first great horror movie: The Texas Chainsaw Massacre!So I started to investigate how to find it. But in my country it's impossible to find the movie in regular video stores, and there is no DVD edition or something. After a couple months after, I gave up. There was impossible. But looking through on-line stores for a copy of William Lustig's 'Maniac', I founded that TLHOTL had VHS edition (Manga Films), so I ordered it, sit and waited for the great movie, the one that you better repeat yourself that was just 'only a movie, only a movie' to avoid fainting. The VHS finally arrived. It was midnight when I plugged in the TV and hold strong to my chair: I was going to see almost a 'snuff movie'!! (that's what some people said here in IMDb). Oh my God, I was scared even before I push play.80 minutes after. The best word that my short English could find is 'disappointed'. I started to think why you always expect something you never finally get? That's how I felt. But that was the first impression.Someone said here before: this movie stays with you days and days. This was true, and the real and complete opinion of the film came to me after hours of cold sweat provoked by... some band of murderers? The film is excellent. Yes, yes, I've read every one of the opinions here in IMDb and in other film forums, and almost all the people who has seen it says the same: 'bad acting, ridicule plot, impossible situations and coincidences, horrible music...' That's all true. So, why do I say that this 'piece of c**p' is 'excellent'? It's almost irrational, unexplainable, because all the negative critics are right, the most part of the movie is just bad, but if we always judge a film in terms of quality and delicate perfection, I think we'll see movies very beautiful in form but empty in contents. The most important thing here is that this movie goes further in terms of brutality or deprivations that almost all movies I've seen before. I mean, could you name 5 more disturbing movies? Maybe I could say just two or three. And it's 31 years old!! Now in 2003 I cannot even find a movie that scares, or disturbs, or just impress. This movie does. So it's clear that if we get sick with this movie now, just imagine it 31 years ago. That's enough to consider it an important horror movie. And if you, who read this, don't like the movie, don't worry: almost nobody does. Maybe that's part of it's charm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was very hard for me to find for rental. Unfortunately, being hard to find doesn't necessarily make a movie good. This is one of the most hyped movies in the history of horror, renowned for being so "disturbing." At the time it was made, it probably was ground-breaking, and I hope I will always be disturbed by rape and murder. But this movie did not meet my inflated expectations. It just wasn't all that scary, partly because the goons were so goofy and the pacing too slow. The lead girl was gorgeous, no question, and I was all for revenge on her behalf. But the movie just wasn't as extraordinary as I had been led to believe. (Granted, some reviewers have always said it is terrible-- Ebert, for example. It isn't terrible, either, though). Last House on the Left is not as depressing or sick or bad as Maniac, and it is commendable on that note. But it wasn't worth all the effort to find, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>O.K. So this suppose to be gore version of Bergman´s immortal master piece "Virgin´s Spring". Someone said that this is like one of the most shocking cinema experiences of all time. Yes, it´s shocking, but far from that status. For me, the acting in "Last House on the left" is so bad and laughable, that it ruined almost every possibility to consider this film "the shock of the century". And, I really couldn´t see the point of making a horror remake out of such a unique film, when the original itself was strong, frightening and powerful enough without a single blood spilled. But still, this one can hold on its own and, no matter that Craven is no Ingmar Bergman, "Last House on the Left" stands as a inspirational, disturbing achievement and a genuine dark satire of the 70´s. And its recommendable without any doubt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House On The Left is one of those movies that has become more known for it's notoriety than whats actually in it. This film is nowhere nearly as gory as it's reported to be , but thats a good thing. Last House On The Left is not supposed to be a movie that emphasis on blood and guts for entertainment purposes. It uses realistic brutality and true crime instead of slasher/zombie fare. Krug and his gang are sadistic savages , they murder without remorse or regret for their crimes against these two girls and thats what makes it the disturbing movie it is.*Possible Spoilers*This is basically a movie you love or hate , as the reviews on this seem to have pointed out. Weather you love it or hate it , it's very rememberable and unjustified except that this stuff really happens which is why it has gained the notoriety it has. The gore in this movie is never as explicit as in movies like Evil Dead, Bad Taste , Dead Alive or anything by Hershell Gordon Lewis or Lucio Fulci , but it's definitly far more violent..and definitly not for the faint of heart.Now I agree with alot of the flaws in this movie , it is very dated..it just reeks with early 1970's in terms of dialogue , and poor choice in music (blame David Hess for this one) and this was Wes Craven's first film so he was basically just learning how to get it right , and so the editing is choppy and poorly inserts scenes of comic relief involving two cops that is unneccessary , and that really laughable music. Possibly these scenes were sliced in between the scenes of rape and torture so the viewer could get a breath of fresh air ..but thats not really how it should work for a film of this natureHowever over all..this is a great movie..and don't really expect an expert cinema masterpiece..it is after all..and exploitation movie with a powerfull gut wrenching feeling of unpleasantness8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Last House On The Left" had a strange effect on me. While watching, I don't recall enjoying much about it. Most everyone reading this knows the basic plot, but here it goes: Two pretty, teenage girls set out to celebrate a birthday by attending a concert and smoking a little dope. When they go to score the dope, they run into a trio of escaped convicts and their idiotic, dope-fiend, teenage buddy. Things go downhill in a real bad way. ***Spoiler Alert*** One girl's parents, being none to chipper about the whole thing, seek good ole bloody revenge.Really, unless you're just one sick cat, I don't see how anyone could actually LIKE watching two teenage girls be beaten, humiliated, raped, and murdered. While that's the bulk of the film, there's a lot to admire when it comes to the style in which it was shot. I enjoyed the grittiness, the distorted soundtrack and the all-out sleazy atmosphere that oozed from every pore. Yes, I've seen this done before with the much more slick "I Spit On Your Grave", but "Last House.." has a certain charm about it that will probably lead me to picking up the DVD.As the writer/director, Wes Craven made some odd choices when it came to the editing and soundtrack of the film. First off, during the torture scenes, he interweaves it with scenes of the girl's parents decorating for her birthday party (!) and playing over it is some early-seventies folk-rock. Very strange indeed. Another thing I thought was a little out-there was having a dummy Sherriff and his dumber deputy thrown into the mix for a little comic relief. WTF? I didn't get it. Wasn't this supposed to be a shock-flick? At Times, I thought I was watching outtakes from Smokey and The Bandit. It was weird.However, when the whole thing was said and done and I had time to think about it a little bit, I realized that all of this actually enhanced the movie in an offbeat sort of way. I really don't think that anything about this movie was supposed to "make sense". It was afterall, a "run of the mill" drive-in flick which rapidly gained a cult following. While I will definitely be seeing this one again, it's hard for me to reccommend to anyone who doesn't like the genre. If You enjoyed "I Spit on Your Grave", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or are looking forward to Rob Zombie's "House Of 1000 Corpses" you may find yourself right at home here. Looking back on it, I really dig it for the kind of movie that it is and I give it ***out of ****. Worth seeing at least once just for the song, "The Road Leads to Nowhere".</fullReview>

The girls are BOTH BIG TIME raped, shot, and left for dead in the woods. One girl even has her arm CUT OFF!!! I watched the MAKING OF IT on my DVD. It said that the crowds back in NY threw up while WATCHING IT!!! This movie is forever going to be on my TOP TEN MOST DISTURBING MOVIE LIST!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like Wes Craven. I like the first Nightmare and the first Scream. I like Hills have Eyes. But he's made some bad stuff too and this film, his first feature, is still the worst. Bad acting, bad script, bad direction make it hard to believe that this is the same director who later directed a film with Meryl Streep (Music from the Heart). At no point do you believe anyone in this film. The parents reaction at finding their murdered daughter is ridiculous. You have to have some believability in a film like this and there is none here. The Making Of documentary that comes with the film on the DVD version is better than the film. No one who has acted in this film ever went on to any prominence in the biz (although looking in the database, I see one guy went on to do a lot of porn) except for, Martin Kove, surprisingly. I bought this film for ten bucks, watched it and traded it back in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You'll need to see this flick only once, I assure you. Its gritty, grainy, and the music sux. Although, I admit I expected more of a graphic display. Its really not too bad as far as visual shock, it hits you deeper than that. I think it was based on a true story, and this movie depiction is pretty damn upsetting. Many think you are supposed to be shocked by the levels the parents sink in their revenge, but i wasnt. I was glad, and cheering them on. And then was upset with myself for feeling that way. I think thats precisely what Craven was seeking. Worked for me. Its pretty famous in its own rite, and i think justifiably so. It achieves some really deep emotional tugs without sinking to excessive gore. Unlike modern attempts, it doesnt try to make you feel any better with humor, although some think the bumbling law enforcement clowns are placed for that very reason. To me, it added to the futility of the story and actually enhanced the horror. Not much else to say, you can watch as i did because of its notoriety, if your into horror. Its horrible alright.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing stuff with a few unexpected laughs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First up, I laughed myself silly when Martin Kove of CAGNEY AND LACEY fame showed up as a deputy sheriff. I guess this is one film that is absent from his CV! Actually, there are a few genuine laughs in this film that come right out of nowhere, but a lot depends on your sense of humour...I thought Weasel's fate, for example, was painfully hilarious, as was the Oliver Hardy-esque way the sheriff waves his tie after winning at chess!For the most part though, LAST HOUSE (which I finally got to see on dodgy quality pirate video after being curious about it for years) is a disturbing and gruesome film. As a teenage girl myself, I could really identify with the helpless terror and nausea of the two female victims as they are subjected to all kinds of sick stuff by the gaggle of squawking geeks. The fact that the villains are so repulsive gives these scenes a lot of their shock power, and the fact that the fake blood is quite realistic (as opposed to the usual tomato soup) adds another wallop. Some people have commented on how crude this film is technically, but I found it to be quite well made in spite of the obviously low budget, and Craven doesn't hold back in his relentless desire to shock and offend the audience. This isn't the kind of film you'd want to watch again and again and enjoy (unless you're REALLY sick) but it is good to dig out maybe once or twice a year, just as a reminder that however lousy your life may be, things can always get a hell of a lot worse.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film on video when I was 15 after discovering Wes Craven watching "A Nightmare on Elm Street." What followed was a harrowing film viewing experience that is the closest thing to a nightmare/dream I've seen. The film is hard to categorize and is not a typical horror film.It is more like a true crime novel with jaunty Dixieland music in the soundtrack and quirky criminal characters who would be comical if it wasn't for the terrible deeds they exact on 2 young girls. It is very much like Greek tragedy where fate and revenge play a key role in the story.*SPOILER ALERT*The rape/torture scenes are realistic and disturbing and after the film ends, I can't say that I felt satisfied after the revenge had been taken out on the film's antagonists but rather emotionally exhausted and disturbed.This is such a strange film in that sense and shows what a talent Wes Craven has for extracting such visceral, primal emotions from his viewers. Although this is not a pleasant or even fun viewing experience it does succeed in being an effective shocker that I have not forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Story ...???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I seem to remember that when this film was released, it was supposedly based on a true story. Not sure if that's true or not, but if so it certainly puts things into a different context. I agree that the quality is not that great - but as others have already said: it was produced on a limited budget. Yes - the plot seems very contrived and "hokey" - for instance, what are the chances that the killers would wind up at one of their victim's homes? But, again - now consider if it IS a true story.Poorly made, perhaps - but still definitely a psychological thriller of the highest order. VERY DISTURBING.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is This Film Truly Shocking?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In short the answer has to be a resounding NO!"WARNING THIS ARTICLE CONTAINS SPOILERS"I have just watched this video (which incidently is still banned in the United Kingdom though God alone knows why) and found it to be a waste of everyone's time and effort.This along with "I Spit On Your Grave" (see separate review) are two of the most infamous (in the U.K. anyway) of the video nasties craze of the early eighties.Everyone wanted to see these films because of the reputation they had. Well, i've just seen this one and couldn't help but laugh most of the way through it. The acting is pretty much on a par with a pre-school nativity play, the direction by Wes Craven leaves much to be desired and the characters are totally one dimensional as to be caricatures.The so called rape scene is devoid of any impact and the final comeuppances of the main protaganists is just so comic.If you've never seen this film then don't, save your cash. If you want to see this film then don't, not unless you like a good comedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reality does bite; a review containing spoilers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I gotta admit, I was armed and ready to hose this flick down. I heard many, many bad things about it, not only about the subject matter, but also about the piss poor technical quality. This was a film that most definitely would suck big time; it would be another "Shivers". I was eager to see it so I could join in on the random bitching and complaining. Only one problem, though: where to find a copy of it! Then, a couple of days ago, a friend of mine complained about having wasted his money on buying a cheap video that turned out to be a be a real piece of sh*t. "You take it home and tell me what you make of it" he said and pushed the box in my hands. Yes, to make a long story short: it WAS LHOTL. I quickly finished my beer, put out my cigarette and, like the song goes, ran all the way home. Someone on this page remarked that around 2.00 AM is probably the best time for this film and it was around that time when I finally stepped through my front door (yup, it WAS a long walk). And, I dunno, I was in a rather good mood that day (about six beers will do that trick) so I felt like giving Wes Craven the benefit of the doubt.Mari Collingwood is going to celeberate her 17th birtday by going to a wild concert in a wild part of town with her wild friend Phyllis. O, why do I even bother: if you've come to this page you know the story premise.In the middle part of this movie, every group of characters seems to be lost in their own level of reality (instead of the director's vision of reality), with the music on the soundtrack expressing their mood. Mari hangs around with Phylis, very content with her developing body. (this part seemed very real to me: I don't know about you, but I'm pretty tired of those One Liner-with-a-Pop Psychology-Message spouting teenagers from Dawson's Creek). Then, they enter the world of Krug and Company, who don't think there's anything wrong with what they do. (the song "Weasel &amp; sadie, Junkie and Krug?" plays; very much like Alex from "A Clockwork Orange", they're just having a good time). Meanwhile, mom and dad seem to be lost in a birthday pie commercial. They're happy in their isolated house in the woods; the big bad outside world only reaches them through newspaper articles. O, and then there are the two deadpan, pie loving, lazy law enforcement yokels (yup, cue the banjo music) who aren't up to their job as they probably spent their entire career joking around, handing out parking tickets and shouting encouragements to weekend motorists. After Krug has raped Mari, the gang suddenly seems to realize the horror of what they've done. A sad tune kick in and without enjoying it, Krug puts an end to Mari's misery by shooting her in the back. It doesn't take long, though, before they shift back in their 'everything is fine' attitude again (the 'funny music' returns). Mom and dad go even further in their 'everything is fine' attitude: Mari still isn't back the second night, but mom and dad go out of their way to turn their house into a comfortable hostel for Krug and Company, who've disguised themselves as salesmen with car trouble (Mom: 'you can use my daughter's room'). Little do mom and dad know that the reality from the newspapers has almost literally crashed in. Slowly, they put 1+1 together and eventually discover Mari's body in the woods. Like Death Wish would go on to emphasize: the more you have to lose, the greater the anger and despair when you actually lose it. Mom and dad turn out to be capable of nasty things, too, revenging their daughter's death with the help of shotguns, chainsaws, and knives. Finally, when the movie ends, all involved parties (the cops; mom &amp; dad; the dead bodies of Mari and Krug) are in one room, sharing the same level of reality, the same feeling: that of loss.Don't worry, I realize that by seeing LHOTL in this light, I'm fooling myself just as much. Wes Craven doesn't deserve much praise for this movie as there are too many flaws to even call this film mediocre: poor cinematography is not the same as documentary style; although the acting delivers on a few crucial moments (Mari chatting with Phylis; Krug and company realising what they've done; Mari and Phylis forced to 'make it with each other'), it's mostly not even second rate (Mari's reaction to Phylis' off screen rape; and, o, just about every other scene and actor in this film: Krug was a bit of a bad ass, but the rest of the gang failed to come across as menacing or extremely dangerous); the poor sound dubbing; the continuity (Mari breathing and moving when her parents found her probably was not the intention; let alone the fact that she was on shore instead of in the lake). The awkward intercutting between the serious humiliation in the woods and the adventures of the Laurel and Hardy of Law is probably just the result of Craven's lack of experience (he admitted that he was learning how to make a film by making one). And Mom and dad's behavior altogether is probably not a case of symbolism, but one of poor, far fetched screenwriting. (Mom being able to, only minutes after she learns of her daughter's dead, pretend to like one of the killers and even performing fellatio on him -- and she doesn't go Bobbitt style until he's come). All in all, Craven bit off more than he could chew (hehehe) by making this film;I guess it isn't likely that he set out to go all heavy handed on his first no-budget film and make a crime story/social satire full of metaphors and symbolism. But kudos to Craven nonetheless for the way he portrays violence in this film. Love it or hate it, most people on this page say. I don't love it, I don't hate it. I tolerate it.*1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing, sickening but not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, like the similarly themed 'I Spit On Your Grave', is harrowing, sickening and disgusting.This was Wes Craven's directing debut and what a shocker (no pun intended) it turned out to be.The story revolves around a group of psychotic killers and two teenage girls out for the night. The girls try to score some dope but unfortunately end up kidnapped, raped and eventually murdered by these killers. One of the murder scenes is particularly harrowing but I won't describe it in case people haven't seen the film.Naturally the killers get their just desserts, but unlike 'I Spit On Your Grave', it is the parents of one of the girls that do it. Like 'I Spit On Your Grave', male genitalia is once again harmed in a sickening way, and all you guys better get ready to cringe.Unfortunately this film is damaged by an attempted comedy element featuring two bumbling police officers and a stupid piece of background music, which is repeated over and over again to the point where you are willing to give up on the film. Personally, I don't think trying to add comedy to such a film is a good idea and in my opinion this is one of the film's main flaws.As most of this pitiful comedy takes place during the first part of the film people are tempted just to turn it off, as I was. But I decided to give the film a chance and in the end it is a very well thought out film. I wouldn't say the film was overly entertaining but it was certainly sickening and dark (except those stupid police officers) and is a satisfying horror film, while also making statements about drug abuse, gang control, rape and murder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another underrated classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The debut feature of Wes Craven (Nightmare on Elm Street; Serpent and the Rainbow; Scream 1,2,3) is the absolute proof that a cost efficient budget is usually the best way to make a truly terrifying horror film. The plot which involves two teenage girls going into the big city looking for pot (this of course, being the '70's) and finding themselves the victims of a group of foul hooligans is perfectly rooted in realism. So is the horrifying revenge that one of the girl's parents exact on these unsuspecting thugs. Simplicity, as always, is the key to convey mood, ambience and terror. Anyone familiar with Ingmar Bergman's classic "The Virgin Spring" is also draw upon the plot parallels.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First steps into greatness!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Wes Craven's first film and a controversial one at that! *Beware* Spoilers ahead* The film starts out as a young naive girl Mari Collingwood(great performance by Sandra Cassel.) is discussing going to the concert with her parents. She is going with Phyllis Stone(terrific performance by Lucy Grantham). Her parents are concerned with this because along-side handling the horses at the nearby ranch, the horses "weren't the only thing she handled. Mari ignores this and goes to the concert with Phyllis. On the way they want to buy some "Grass", and thus they get captured by Krug and his gang of sadists. The girls get drug into the car trunk, through the woods, and are beaten almost to death. Then the criminals humiliate them(make them "make it" with eachother)and eventually kill them off, only to meet even sterner justice form Mari's parents. This film was controversial for it's portrayal of rape. But there is little rape here-if any! There is a 10 second rape and that's all! The rest is all torture and terror beyond any measure! With great direction, gorgeous scenery, and great performances by ALL! A perfect bulls-eye for Then unknown director Wes Craven. This film was made not as a splatter flick-or exploitation pick-but as a message of anti-violence to all America. A must for all craven fans!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The music that is.Out of all the video nasties that the BBFC decieded for me that I couldn't watch, this is the one I wanted to see most. Not just because its banned, but to see what Wes Cravens first movie was like. I actually waited 5 months for my dutch dvd to come! Was it worth it? Probably.The fisrt thing I'll say is how disturbing the actual music is. Why they let David Hess compose it I'll never know! Bluegrass just doesn't suit a movie about the abduction, rape, and murder of two 17 year olds. I mean, the lyrics in the songs are actually about what the group of villains are doing to the young women!Is the movie as shocking as its reputation would lead you to believe? I think yes. Not in what you actually see (as it was probably shot on a shoestring!) but the actual premise that is there is a very dark one. I also think David Hess is exellent as the evil, shameless Krug, bringing a real darkness to the charachter. You really feel a sence of terror for the two abductees.I suppose if you don't hace a strong stomach, the intestine shot and the biting off of weasels genitals could turn it for you, but if, like me, you enjoy extreme horror, then I definatley recommend this movie, even if just to see how influential it has been on later films.</fullReview>

The acting isn't all that bad I suppose, but the film is badly framed and the script is full of crap. This for us was a drawing point. I always like seeing B-movies where the characters constantly talk about "Grass" and how they're going to "off" somebody. Don't believe any stories about this movie being shocking, it's just funny. For example, dont miss the fun filled theme song about "Weasel and Sadie and Junkie and Dad". In short, this one would have been a great MST3K!

		<fullReview>It`s not many movies that make me want to write a review for IMDb.I read all the reviews on here and thought this must be a truly disturbing and terrible film. However, I appear to be the only person to have seen it to think that this film is a load of old bollocks. I watched the uncut version of this film on DVD and was thoroughly disappointed. It was neither disturbing, scary or convincing. The acting is appaling and the plot is stupid. If a film maker wants to make a scary horror, it needs to be serious all the way through, as is A Nightmare on Elm Street. This film however introduces two bumbling cops into the plot, rather like a Laurel and Hardy double act, which takes off any edge the film supposedly already had. Now consider this. The bunch of psychos attack, humiliate and kill two girls. After this they decide to find somewhere to stay. Lo and behold! Where do they find? The house of one of their victims! While the parents of the unfortunate girl invite three complete strangers to spend the night (YEAH RIGHT!) the three are also heard spilling the beans about the murders. What ensues is something out of an adult carry on film. We get psycho Mommy demasculating one of the killers... (by the way, where was the blood?), Daddy acting all Nancy Thomson and rigging his house up with booby traps, and then turning into one of the Sawyer family from the Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Hmmm, is it REALLY just me, or has this film`s reputation taken it far beyond what praise (if any) it deserves. I hope people read this review before renting/buying or even watching this tripe. Save your money... IT`S CRAP!</fullReview>

Yes i can highly disagree but anyone onto this film.In my opinion this film is great, and people will think im a nasty pervert who enjoys seeing girls gettin raped, well no, i actaully, don't like the rape scenes cause I just feel remorse. What I like about this movie is that it is so real, and yet so interesting to see the killers stumble upon "the last house on the Left" because that usaully wouldn't happen in real life, its very cool to see. What i also like about this movie is the revenge factor.

		<fullReview>I first heard of last house on the left while watching a documentary about horror films on channel 4. The presenter started talking about it and said that it is still banned over here in England because it is so shocking. A year later I went to college and met someone who had it. He borrowed it me and on my day off I decided to watch it and find out what all the fuss was about. I found out. I now know why it was banned. Basicly the film follows two young girls aged 17 who are on their way to a concert. They stumble across a group of sadistic murderers. The murderers kidnap them and horribly and viciously murder them. Now I am one who can handle real life pretty well. Better than some poeple. But after watching this film I felt sick and deeply disturbed. I realized for the first time that things like this don't just happen in movies, they actually happen to real people in real life. The scene where they savage and murder one of the young girls in an area that is no more than 100 feet from her house was the most disturbing scene I have ever witnessed. So was it a good film? in my opinion yes but I did however NOT enjoy it. It will stay in my mind for years to come.</fullReview>

The part that makes it the scariest is how real it is! Movies like Friday the 13th can't freak you that much because real people cannot keep coming back to get you!The plot of this movie, if there is a plot, two girls get picked up by 3/4 escaped convicts, and the rest of the movie is basically them trying to get away, and being down right tortured.

		<fullReview>I just watched this movie last night and ever since I have been thinking about it in the back of my mind. I have read about this movie in many places as being disgusting and vile. But in my opinion it isn't at all. This movie is very suggestive but is not all that graphic as many people say. I think that the reason this movie has got this kind of reputation is because of it's effect on your mind afterwards. This movie is very Psychological. It really makes you think about how sick people can be. But besides the fact that this movie is very disturbing it is also a pretty good movie. The acting and script are pretty descent considering this was made in the early 70's. So if your looking for an intense thought provoking thriller than this is a pretty good movie but if your looking for a gore filled shocker than this is not for you.</fullReview>

The sound track alone is enough to drive a person crazy; never mind the opening scene where a young girl discusses her nipples with her father. Who talks like that?? I started to think that this was a porno for a minute. Euck. You'll understand when you see the movie. Sure, there are a few great gory scenes; but not enough to make up for the lack of a sensible plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty sick stuff...definitely disconcerting!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not wishing to sound 'big-headed', I consider myself to be somewhat of a 'buff' when it comes to the horror genre. However, I must point out that I am NOT a fan, at all, of Wes Craven's work. I managed to hunt down a copy of 'Last House' a few months ago...and while it was somewhat grainy and old it didn't really seem to lessen the overall impact of the movie itself. Make no bones about it: this is one disturbing film, and in my opinion, probably unsurpassed for its sheer unpleasantness.I'm not going to run through the narrative (see it for yourself) but I guess I really want to focus on the effect that it had on me. 'Last House' came as a great shock to me. Having only seen brief clips of the film itself I got a vague grasp of what it was all about and I doubt, strongly, that nothing could have prepared me for what was to come. There is a touching quality to the story itself which, I feel, contributes to the overall shock-value of the film. By building a (very) brief relationship with the onscreen victims, Mari and Phyllis, the audience cannot help but feel upset and angered by their torture and eventual death(s), much in a similar way to, say, that of a close friend or family member. To make it worse, this also happens to be on Mari's birthday...and she's only 17; simply abominable! Who on earth could possibly comprehend being raped and then shot on their 17th birthday?! There is no blatant or logical motive for Mari or Phyllis' deaths, they did not break 'the rules' that Craven memorably lays down in 'Scream', apart from maybe trying to buy drugs ("dope"). In fact, both girls are more-or-less the epitome of the youth culture of 1960s America: Mari even sports a peace emblem round her neck.The film is realistic to an extent, yet laughable in places. The killers appear hyperbolic, simply for their warped minds and their practically relentless craving for the macabre. They do not have supernatural powers, like 'Jason Voorhees' or 'Freddy Kreuger' but are equally, if not more so, sinister. David Hess's performance as 'Krug' ( - he also played a similar role in Ruggero Doedato's 'House On The Edge of The Park') is a good example of this. Forget 'Leatherface', 'The Candyman', and 'Pinhead'...they all seem somewhat mild compared to 'Krug'. Perhaps this is where we become the most scared, of the 'real' and believable killer.What I found strange were the killings that occur at the end of the film (*SPOILER*). It seems unbelievable that a middle-aged couple could tackle a group of 4 psychotic criminals and win. The 'Collingwoods' (Mari's parents) kill their victims swiftly, unlike Krug and company. But there also appears to be an affinity between both parties. But hey, this is a horror film! It makes you wonder who the real killers/victims are. This is also the case with Craven's next film 'The Hills Have Eyes'. Perhaps middle-class America isn't based merely around smiles and fortune.I believe I gave this film a '6'. 'Last House' isn't the best horror film that I have ever seen but for realism and the visceral feeling that I obtained this is a more-than-adequate grade. Like many other reviewers I also tended to feel ashamed for actually watching the killings, denoting that I was somehow part of it. To close I would just like to draw attention to the films musical score: it seems to coincide, almost perfectly, with what is happening onscreen. The fact that a sympathetic and tender score is played after Mari's rape makes us relate to her unfortunate violation and feel deeply saddened. Disconcerting stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't pay attention to the video box</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie for sale the other day and feel the need to comment on the video (and DVD) box. The packaging makes the film look like a traditional haunted house movie. The film is a horror film, but a different kind of horror film--the Last House on the Left is NOT a haunted house! I've seen this movie several times and it is still very powerful. Wes Craven went on to more commercial projects, yet none of them are as well-acted and (yes) skillful as this one. It has received some very harsh criticism over the years, but its influence can be seen in movies such as "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer" and "Natural Born Killers." The trio of murderers in this film (and I am not including the speed-freak son of the leader) has got to be the most chilling group of killers in '70s cinema. I would rank them with the hillbillies in Deliverance. And you cannot beat the "parents become monsters" twist at the end. The film misfires with a silly subplot involving an inept sheriff, who seems destined for The Dukes of Hazzard, but Last House on the Left is a jolting, horrifying experience nevertheless. Just don't get fooled by the DVD or video packaging!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I must say this film is one of the sickest ever made. But also, it is one of the best. Horror maven Wes Craven's directoral debut is a sick and twisted movie, bound to give you either chills or nausea. The film was made for around $50,000 and the editing, music, and acting can be terrible at times, but it hasn't lost any effect to please. Craven definitely is a master at what he does, which is why this film has attracted such a cult following. If you have an hour and a half to spare, I suggest this movie (only to TRUE horror films buffs; others may want to stay clear), but just keep repeating to yourself "It's only a movie, it's only a movie..."There are several different cuts of this film. Most times you can only find the 83 minute version, which has most of the sickness edited. Look for the full length 91 minute version...with a barfbag handy.</fullReview>

If Bin Laden ever loosens up enough to rent a movie, he will surely enjoy this piece of rank scum.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong - I LOVE good horror films. Problem is, this piece of utter trash is NOT good by any stretch of the imagination. It's very difficult to believe that Wes Craven, who built a career comeback out of using restraint in his films (re: "Scream") made this. This film is little more than an excuse to show depraved and sickening acts of cruelty, with absolutely no artistic value. (Now "The Accused" has a graphic rape scene, too, but that film was trying to make a statement about our society.)I can't imagine how anyone can consider this film to be entertaining. What kind of sicko enjoys watching graphic images of undressed teenage girls being raped? This film is best suited for people who like watching violent pornography but are too ashamed to go to an adult video store. If you want to see a GOOD horror film, try "Dawn of the Dead" or something. This thing is just utter crap, and if I could I'd sue Craven to get back the lousy 2 bucks I paid for the rental - yes, that's how BAD it is.</fullReview>

It is powerful and creepy and lame and cheesy and disturbing and in the long run, GOOD!

		<fullReview>I just purchased the re-release of "Last House" on VHS from MGM Movietime for less than $10. I watched the film and was bitterly disappointed at the reduction of quality compared to the 1985 Vestron Video I already owned. The new video was inferior, and was not only formatted to fit your TV, it was out of focus and left a great deal of the picture out of frame. The film itself is campy, with hokey country background score put the beat of an amateur production. There's two girls looking for pot that end up in the hands of four psychotic kidnaping perverts. Coincidentally, they are led to woods where the main girl lives, humiliated, and then led to their fates by the hands of disgusting criminals. The movie isn't as disturbing as "Chainsaw Massacre", or as gruesome as "Henry: Portrait Of A Serial Killer", but has a couple scenes that one might find rather unsettling. The original film deserves a widescreen DVD revival that hasn't happened yet. I hope it's better than the murky copy I just bought.</fullReview>

A night of pure teen innocence turns into unspeakable horror. Basically, its the girls fault, maybe after seeing this movie, the tagline "Dont talk to strangers" developed. Don't get me wrong, i actually like and own this movie (unrated import from japan of course!!!) But this isn't your average horror movie, if your gonna have a couple people over this isn't the movie to pop in, "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" is a perfect get together film, that later. Actually, if you do watch this with a group, you wont help but hear, "ewww" or "holy s**t" as this movie is shocking.

		<shortDescription>Aggressive and Ferocious Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left(1972) is to some people one of the most disgusting and vilest movies ever put on the big screen. Couragous and influential film that challenges the audience with its disturbing images. Produced by Sean S. Cunningham who later directed the trend setter, Friday the 13th(1980), Last House on the Left became a early watermark for his career. One of the ten best horror films to come out of the 1970s. Its message is bold, the images are daring, and the direction is powerful.Last House on the Left(1972) is Wes Craven's masterpiece of his entire career. The only time Wes Craven did a film that took chances with taboo subject matters. The most grim and unsympathetic film ever done by Wes Craven. Direction is not great, but very good for a first time director. What I enjoy about the movie is it doesn't pander to the audience like the successful but overrated Scream films do.Many of the violent scenes were done as symbolic gesture to the chaotic events of the late 60s to early 70s. Takes a deep look into the dark side of the free love generation. Symbolizes all the violence that was happening during this period, including the Vietnam War, Mansion killings, the riots, assassinations, Cold War, and the Charles Whitman shootings. This film puts together all these events to describe the madness of the times. The symbolic meaning is lost among people of my generation.Krug is one of cinema's evilest and vilest characters. The character of Krug seems to be loosely based on serial killer, Charles Mansion. Krug is the first of many evil villains that appear in Craven's films. The name of Krug is later used in A Nightmare on Elm Street(1984). Billy Loomis of Scream(1996) is a cleaned up version of Krug.Many of Last House on the Left's images and themes utilize many elements from the works of the marquis de Sade. First, the sex &amp; violence relationship merge to become inseparateable. Second, it uses very well the favorite Desade theme of the powerful overcoming the weak. Third, the main villains seem to be patterned after the four protagonists of 120 Days of Sodom. Like the four characters from 120 Days of Sodom, the four villains imerese into sexual perversity.Mainly known for the "in the woods" scene which is the main source of controversy. This sequence was heavily cut in its USA release after the films initial release. Has been fully restored on French DVD. This one sequence matches the brutal and sadistic nature of the infamous "family massacre on video" from Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer(1986). Reminds me of the final section of 120 Days of Sodom.An influential film for the structure of LHONL is Straw Dogs(1972). Both deal with the same themes with different results. A low budget take on Straw Dogs with a harder edge on subject matter. Both deal with people who react to violence by committing acts of violence themselves. Last House on the Left is more brutal but not subtle in depicting violent behavior.The best acting comes from David Hess. As Krug, he not only plays his character well, but also sets the mood for the rest of the actors. His performance began a career of memorable turns as slimy villains. A bravado and sleezy turn that carries the film all the way. One performance that matches Hess with his convincing acting is Michael Rooker's dead on creepy performance as Henry Lee Lucus.According to the book on the making of the movie, there were violent and sadistic scenes from the "in the woods" sequence that didn't make it into the film or final cut. Last House on the Left is to cinema what 120 Days of Sodom is to literature. One reason the film hits a cord within the nervous system is its realistic depiction of violence towards women. This film was made on a very low budget which restricts it in some areas. Helped by its semi-documentary, hand held photography, and gritty look.None of the director's later films have come close to matching the stomach turning, mindbending intensity of this film. My favorite Wes Craven film because it has the guts to tell people what they don't want to hear. Inspired many knockoffs and imiatiors. Extremely daring, taboo busting, and envelope pushing movie that belongs with the likes of Cannibal Holocaust, Videodrome, Salo:120 Days of Sodom, Henry:Portrait of a Serial Killer, New York Ripper, Bad Lieutentant, and countless other bold and daring films. The director's most underrated and overlooked motion picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film of three distinct parts - the bad, the ugly, and the downright dumb.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>WARNING : SPOILERS AHEAD. DO NOT READ THIS REVIEW IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM.Wes Craven's most notorious feature was cobbled together on a shoestring budget provided by a backer who instructed Craven and his producer Sean Cunningham to make a "knock-down, drag-out horror film". The finished product was released under a number of titles (Krug and Company, Sex Crime Of The Century) before it finally turned over a profit with its current, irrelevant name - there is no 'last house on the left', but it's a great title anyway. I first watched this film on somewhat degraded pirate video at two in the morning some years ago, the best possible circumstances (in my opinion) for subjecting yourself to this gruelling ride into the dark underbelly of American society. Like it or not, the whole film revolves around the extremely disturbing middle section, in which two cute female hippies (especially Sandra Cassel as Mari, who looks like a young Jennifer Connelly) are tortured, stripped, humiliated, raped and mutilated by a repulsive quartet of screeching, sniggering geeks. This is as strong as cinema gets, and Craven films the whole thing in tight, claustrophobic close-up, so we almost feel their pain and degradation. The scene where Phyllis is disembowelled is disturbing enough (especially as one of the psychos mutters "Oh Christ" while his female colleague tugs at the girl's entrails), but the scene that follows - which begins with the psychos tearing Mari's sanity in half with one clawing stroke by dropping her best friend's severed hand in front of her, and ends with the disgusting Krug carving his name on her chest before raping her - will make even the most hardened gorehound feel sick to the bottom of his black little heart. Craven follows this up with a convincingly morbid moment of gut-wrenching sadness and futility - as Mari staggers away, dazed and vomiting, her innocence utterly stolen, the gang stand around fidgeting, nauseated, dodging eye-contact, visibly sickened by their own amoral behaviour. The moment may be brief, but it is crucial in showing us that Craven's killers do have some emotions after all, however deadly and deranged they may be. Sadly, Craven uses up all his tricks in this segment and the rest of the film collapses into the same blend of amateur acting, technical incompetence and bad black comedy that characterised the first segment. The lunatics hole up at Mari's house, attempt to pass themselves off as plumbers / insurance salesmen, and finally get a taste of their own medicine. Weasel gets his penis bitten off during fellatio, in an incredibly poorly-staged sequence that wouldn't look out of place in a Troma outing. Junior sensibly shoots himself, Krug is decapitated (out of shot) and it's not clear what happens to Sadie, as her death is filmed in almost total darkness. There are also a couple of pre-Nightmare On Elm Street booby traps and dream sequences, one of which is pretty funny, but these lowbrow antics seem horribly misplaced against the horrors that went before. Like DELIVERANCE (1972), where the interest fades after the drooling, terrifying hillbillies are killed, LAST HOUSE loses its audience after scaring the pants off them and gropes toward a botched denouement. Even the continuity goes awry - Mari died in the lake, but her folks find her on the bank! All in all, a scrappy and disjointed film, but try getting the worst excesses out of your mind for the next few days...</fullReview>

Maybe it's just me though in saying that it didn't bother me emmensely, probably due to the fact that I've seen LOTS of whack movies that probably have desensitized me to how bad this stuff really is...anyway. A group of killers, two concert goers, and their vengeful parents all fit into this REVENGE movie. Some really sick stuff in this one...what's up with the music? I hardly think the country/folk soundtrack was appropriate for a movie as serious as this. It's a horror movie...setting this seedy subject matter to folk music is disturbing enough...

		<fullReview>Now for something completely different.,Wes Craven's notorious debut film pulls no punches and packs as much comment into its 77 minutes than most directors manage to do in their entire career. With the wonders of technology it's now possible to view this on an imported DVD from some far-flung nether region although I stand by my claim that such a film is best experienced on a 1st Generation copy of a pre-cert VHS. Like the one I've owned for the past decade or so and viewed at least half a dozen times. I don't know what it is that compels me about this film--be it the sheer brutal intensity of the murder scene or the visceral and downright menace of David Hess' performance (also see my comments on "House On The Edge Of The Park" and "Hitch-Hike"--coming soon to a movie database near you) but "Last House..." is a landmark in film-making and deserves to be seen by as wide an audience as possible.Sadly, we both know that this (at least in the UK and Ireland) will never become a reality.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very effective little movie for those who can handle it. I personally find the movie more funny than I do scary though. To really get the feel for this movie, try to find the uncut version which has some major differences from the toned down version.SPOLIERS:This movie starts off with Mari Collingwood taking a shower. We hear from the mailman that today is her 17th birthday. Afterwards we find she is going to a concert with her friend Phyliss, who comes from the neighborhood where the concert is taking place. Phyliss is from that side of town and is used to the wicked ways of the world, while Mari is the innocent one. While on their way to the concert, they hear on the radio that convict Krug Stillo has escaped custody with some other people including "an animal like woman who kicked a dog death when it was deployed to try and capture them". It's these things that make up this movie. So anyways, they go to the concert and afterwards decided to get some "grass". Meanwhile, Krug and his gang (Weasel, a sex offender, Saide, the animal-like woman, and Junior Stillo, Krug's son whom he has hooked on herion) are hiding out, and Saide has refused to have sex with either Krug or Weasel until they get some more women. So off Junior goes, jonesin to get his fix, out on the street. Marie and Phyliss decide to talk to him about getting some grass. They end back up at the hideout where Phyliss is raped by the gang, with the exception of Junior.The next day they put the girls in the trunk of their car, and off they go, joyriding to some hippie music. Listen closely to this happy-go-lucky toon. It has to be one of the funniest songs ever in the context it is used. It talks about the Stillo gang driving around with nothing do and how they are going to have fun with these two little children. Another example of the humor in this film. Anyways, the girls are humilated and raped, and killed. In these scenes, the music that is played is very effecitve. And the part where Mari is killed is very sad. After her rape, her innoncense is gone. Look closely during this scene, the killers are remorseful about what they have done to her. ANd so she is mercifully killed in a gut-wrenching scene, not because of it's violence, but because of it's melancholy.Now on to ACT III. Here the killers ask the parents of Mari to let them spend the night, unware of them being Mari's parents. Weasel immeadetly takes a liking to Mari's mother. Watch the part where he stands up in front of her, and she looks to the side, like "what the hell is that all about?", another classic humorous moment in the film. Soon after all this comes a very funny dinner scene where Sadie is drinking wine like it was beer. After dinner, Ms. Collingwood sees that Junior is wearing a necklace given to Mari for her b-day. At this point in the film Mr. and Mrs. Collingwood use their psychic powers to determine that Mari's body is at the lake. They go to her still breathing, moving body (which is one of the film's flaws) and take her body back to their house. Then they kill off the Stillo gang. The part where Weasel gets his is one of the all time great scenes in movie history.Now where it sounds like I was bashing this film in some parts, I was. But I do love this movie and think that it is very effective. I know I didn't mention the parts about the sheriff b\c I 'msure you've seen enough dumb cops in movies to last you a lifetime, and I'm trying to get the horrifying site of the chicken truck driver out of my mind. Anyways, it's a very good, above average horror movie because the characters of the villians are very well done, especially Weasel. Poor Weasel.I give LHOTL 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I knew nothing about this film before I saw it. It starts amazingly well, with some rag-tag &amp; bobtail acting in the early scenes which familiarise us with Mari. Her father (played brilliantly in a one off film appearance by Gaylord St.James) fantastically portrays the inate potential for psychosis by manically observing his wife making a 17th Birthday cake for Mari.I won't spoil anymore for anyone, because this is definitely a film where the less you know the better. But suffice to say, the violence is done menacingly, but the whole film has a tremendous black humour to it which juxtaposes edgily in places with horrific scenes of rape and humiliation.Considering the tiny budget and limited resources, this is an absolute classic and a true gem. The inept slapstick police are a comedy joy (including a future Karate Kid &amp; Cagney+Lacey star in their midst), the music, which was done by the geezer who played the head psycho Krug is hippie period joy(especially the 'Road to Nowhere' song that pops up at opportune moments) and the film is short enough not to outstay its welcome.9/10 :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this film has some great attributes and some poor ones too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really like this film, just because it shows where Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham came from in film making (they were both responsible later for creating the two biggest serial characters in modern horror films, Jason and Freddy).When I was first getting into 'banned' films (coz I live in UK where there are many banned), I heard losts of hype about this film, so obviously I wanted to get hold of a copy.Firstly I acquired a Dutch copy (later I find this is probably most uncut version), watched and was not very impressed... I watched it a few more times over several months and started to appreciate the film for some storyline and plot elements.Later I acquired a US unrated release - stating that it was 3 minutes longer, I watched and saw no difference, being very curious, I setup 2 videos and played the film side by side. I soon realised it was frame rates that made the 3 minute difference, but also notice something else, some of the scenes were edited differently and hence had a different impact - the one I noticed most was the scene where Mari is raped and Krug cuts his name on her neck - in the Dutch release, this is one long scene, but in the US release this scene is split in two with the scene of the blundering policemen - making the US version seem a lot less harsh and nasty than the Dutch.Later I bought a comprehensive book on the film, read it cover to cover, then watched the film again, with all this new information in my head, I enjoyed the film much much more, so now it's one of my favourites.Krug scares the hell out of me though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's finest film to date.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is without doubt Craven's finest film to date and its unlikely he will ever make a better film. Shot on a shoe string budget Craven and his partner Sean S Cunningham, the man behind Friday the 13th, have created an Ugly, disturbing but brilliantly made film. The Plot is loosely based upon an earlier film by a man named Ingmar Bergman called `the Virgin Spring', and that film is in turn based upon an old, Swedish legend about a girl who is on her way to church when a group of shepherds rape and kill her. Her parents soon hear about this and decide to take bloody revenge upon her killers. This is basically what `last house' is about. But once you scrape away the cheap looking surface you will find a film which underneath is a whole lot more complex and much more meaningful. Craven made this film as a metaphor for the recent war in Vietnam, and after the killing spree of infamous killer Charles Manson. The Vietnam symbolism can be seen with the girls parents, happy ordinary Americans, moving into uncharacteristic bouts of extreme violence in order to avenge their daughters death. Also after all the blood shed and carnage the parents have achieved nothing as their daughter is still dead. The film is also a complex study of serial killers, possibly the best(a long side "Henry:Portrait of a serial killer"). Craven never for once lets the audience sympathise with the serial killers but does open a window of insight into how they have the power to kill. In one particularly, and possibly best in the whole film, scene the serial killers toy with the girls as if playing with a favourite toy but once the game gets out of hand the killers look down upon the carnage with sadden confusion as if their favourite toy has become broken. This film is also a very important one in the genre of horror, if that's what genre this incredibly complex film can be pigeon holed into. Before it there was only one horror film which dealt with serial killers and that was `Psycho', which came nearly 12 years before it. If you compare the two films together `Last House on the Left' is by far the scarier and, in my opinion, the best. `Psycho's' main killer, Norman Bates, lives along in a run down motel which no one ever visits. The killers in `Last House on the Left' don't live outside of society. These are people who could live just down the road from you, who on the surface seem like nice ordinary people but, without warning, are capable of lashing out in to such acts as torture, rape and murder. This is where the films true element of horror comes from, the people with in it who are out of control but are accepted by society, as Mari's parents accept the killers into their home, with open arms. To be fair this film does have it's faults. Krug, played by David Hess and Mari, played by Sandra Cassel turn in excellent performances. Mari's friend, Phyllis Stone and the other two serial killers turn in average performances. Mari's parents came straight from doing T.V soaps, and it shows. And the police men, well the less which is said about them the better is all I can say. The sound and picture quality are slightly poor, but which can be forgiven due to the films budget. And the sound track , written by lead actor David Hess, although good in parts, the song `The road leads to no-where' comes to mind, is generally too happy and for that reason unsuitable for the films content. But these are minor quibbles for an otherwise brilliant film which should be seen by all who is interested by the horror genre. But it is rather violent and disturbing film as the tag line suggests ` To avoid fainting keep repeating, it's only a movie, only a movie, only a movie'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great but not really nasty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the French DVD of this film recently and I have to say it is pretty good. The best actors are David Hess as the brutal Krug and Marc Sheffler as Krug's drug addict son Junior. While the film is not as nasty as people say it is, I must admit the rape scenes and murder are quite nasty. The Collingwood's revenge is also good.However, those two cops are not funny at all and that dreadful hillbilly soundtrack does not do the film any favours. All in all, a very good film although I think the BBFC really need to get out more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As soon as we see the first image , we know it won't be very beautiful - its filmed in 16 mm , the sound is so bad we can hardly hear what the actors are saying ( but the actors are not so bad , I've seen worst). Two girls go for a ride - when we see the car and the camera is following it while we hear changing music on the radio , it shows how the climate in this film can be intense . Arrived at town they become hostages of some dangerous people who take them back to dark country . Then the carnage begins . Sometimes its truly unbearable : they dismember , rape , besides that this film is technically a fiasco , with some ugly music and pitiful image quality . After the massacre , it turns into a revenge tale . This film is worth seeing , but you'll understand , not for the same reason than a masterpiece , for the opposite .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film today, considering it has been banned in the UK since 1984, from a copy of the supposed uncut french DVD.Before I switched it on, I was actually quite scared, considering the write-up it has had. I've read that it is one of the most disturbing and gory films that are around, and I must say that I was very disappointed.I actually found the film quite enjoyable, as in the "so bad, it's good" category. In the version I saw, and I cannot honestly say if it is uncut or not, there was nothing which warranted the films ban in 1984 by the BBFC (British Board Of Film Classification).To be honest, I've seen more gore in an episode of the X-Files, but then again I can only go on my source of the film which said was the uncut version.The plot, although being a supposed cover of Virgin Springs, was Ok. the script was completely laughable and the acting was just as comedic, apart from Weasel, who if you watch carefully, seems to be the only cast member who has partaken in acting lessons.To cut a long story short, I was expecting to be scared/shocked and just found the whole thing laughable and completely ungory. If this was the true uncut version that I saw, then the folks at the BBFC need to get out more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This isn't a great movie, and it isn't totally a horror film either, it seems like more of a crime documentary, a shocking tale of rape and murder. Mari Collingwood and Phyllis Stone are two teen girls on their way to a Bloodlust concert. They are looking for some marijuana, and accidentally meet up with four criminals, Krug, Weasel, Sadie, and Junior. The foursome are a group of nasty lowlifes who proceed to terrorize the two girls. I won't ruin anything else for you, because what follows is what the film is all about. It is gritty, grim, and grainy. The characters are realistic and the direction is raw. You really feel for Mari and Phyllis when they are terrorized. It really gets to you. See this movie. Don't expect a masterpiece, don't expect to jump out of your seat and scream, just expect this film to get under your skin and stay there for days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard so much about how shocking and violent this film was, and because it was banned in the UK I forked out for the uncut French DVD of this movie. Having sat through this film in it's uncut form I can honestly say that I was not at any point shocked or disturbed by anything in this film. LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is not an especially violent film nor an especially good one. The violence displayed here pales beside that shown in movies by Italian directors such as LUCIO FULCI and DARIO ARGENTO. The film is very dragged out and at times quite dull. It fails as a horror film because it is simply not scary. This film cannot hold a torch to the likes of THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE and it's huge cult status is totally undeserved. The sole "virtue" of this movie is the superb performance of David Hess as leading psycho Krug Stillo. An average exploitation movie, no more, no less. 6 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sad commentary on the state of the human condition today...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We'd thought we'd seen it all, my friend and I. We shared the common interest of being horror film buffs, and we had run the gamut. SUSPIRIA. DAWN OF THE DEAD. PHANTASM. THE EXORCIST. FRIDAY THE 13TH. HALLOWEEN. RE-ANIMATOR. SCANNERS. THE FLY remake. VIDEODROME. There wasn't a gore-filled good time, well made, poorly made or in-between that you could name, that we hadn't been through once...or twice...or more.Then, just on a lark, I admitted one Saturday night that there was one film I had never seen before...a film that had the reputation of being the most horrifying film ever made; more than anything even the most die-hard horror fan could possibly imagine. That film was LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. One of the reasons I had skipped it, was because those who had told me about it, warned me to stay away from most of the video store versions that were out. Even articles I'd read about it said that if it was possible, you had to see it uncut. And wouldn't you know it: we found a store that had an uncut copy, which had recently been re-released after being "banned for years," according to the box. So we decided to take the plunge.In what had to have been a first for both of us, we had to turn it off. Halfway into the indescribable rape-murder in the forest, my friend and I silently looked at each other, and he hit the "EJECT" button.We grabbed our coats and walked outside, just walking and talking for about two hours, about how what we had seen affected us. Our feelings were mutual: for anyone not to be moved in some way by that horror, it could only be under one of two conditions. They were either dead, or they had killed someone themselves, and it was beyond them to be moved in any way by what they were seeing. Reluctantly, we knew that though we were sickened, outraged and horrified beyond belief, there was no way we could leave it unfinished. So after a few more moments, we went back and did just that.To this day, I think that this film alone is the reason why my nerves became deadened enough, so that all the horror and action films that followed, with their increasing levels of violence and gore, needed to be more and more extreme to elicit any kind of reaction for me. Or a lot of the audience members around me.And that is what frightens me most of all, especially as I read a lot of the reviews that have been posted about LHOTL. Not the memory of how horrifying the experience of seeing this was, or how fresh in my mind that memory still is after all these years, but that so many people who have seen it and written about it here NO LONGER FIND IT SHOCKING. But with all the murder, mayhem and assorted pandemonium that we now bear witness to every evening on the 6 and 11 o'clock news, I no longer find that fact strange. I find instead, that it gives me more chills than any horror movie that can ever be made. And an even more terrifying thought:As social commentary and an extremely grim reminder of where we have been as a society, if we can no longer acknowledge this film as such, then where in the hell are we headed?Keep that thought in mind, then rent this if you can find it, and watch it AGAIN...if you can.I know I can't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Blair Witch" of its time (and that ain't a compliment)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Thanks to a brilliant marketing campaign ("To avoid fainting, keep repeating, It's only a movie... only a movie...") this incompetently made c**p became a box office smash and launched the career of Wes Craven, who would go on to many years of increasingly expensive c**p. If what you've heard about this movie leads you to expect something disturbing, forget it. Craven seems determined NOT to make the viewer uneasy, as the potentially unsettling murders of two teenage girls are constantly softened by unwelcome musical interludes and unfunny comic relief from two bumbling cops and a woman driving a truck full of chickens. There's no need for you to keep repeating "it's only a movie"; Craven himself insists on reminding you with every scene! The film's climax, in which one girl's parents take their revenge on the killers, is so devoid of logic and continuity it makes any Ed Wood film look like Citizen Kane. Like Blair Witch, this film benefited from a wave of hype which promised audiences a soul shaking experience that just wasn't there. Filmgoers would have to wait another year for Tobe Hooper to actually deliver that promise with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Look how far we've come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this when I was in my early teens and it scarred me. (And I do mean "scarred", not "scared".) The brutality and sadism presented left its mark on me for a long time afterwards.I watched it again tonight on IFC and I have to say it didn't affect me one way or the other; much in the same way it doesn't seem to affect many of the people who have left reviews on this page- particularly younger viewers.All I can say is that it is a sign of how comfortable we are with brutality and outrage that this movie packs no stronger punch anymore. The cover of this week's TIME magazine has a photo of a man with blood-soaked hands being cheered by a happy mob as it tears a soldier to pieces (literally). That's available at every grocery store checkout stand across the country. When we live in a culture so at ease with this level of madness and savagery, what purpose does a film like LAST HOUSE serve? None. It is an antiquated relic.The film was made in reaction to the elevated level of violence (Vietnam, Manson, the civil rights battles, the assassinations of the 60s, etc.) that had suddenly permeated popular consciousness at that time. Since then, we have only become better at hurting each other and more jaded at the results of that hurt. Mainstream movies now regularly feature the nihilism and soullessness that early 70s horror tried to exploit. The culture has far exceeded the fantasies of thirty years ago.The film is badly shot, poorly edited, lamely acted, and horribly scored. It does try to achieve more than your average splatter film, but grasps only fleeting moments of success.That being said, it is sad that this film no longer shocks our senses. Movies, and our own penchant for inhumanity, have sped far past this minor landmark of film violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, Disturbing, Stupid Soundtrack (Some Spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hello I stayed up late last night to watch this one on the Inde Film Channel, and I tell you, it was definitely disturbing. BUT I couldn't take it seriously with the stupid ass soundtrack being played behind the chase scenes. Also how can you take a horror movie seriously when the characters are shown running in the credits at the end. When the characters are dead keep them that way. Also more of the crappy songs were played over the credits. I thought the music was scary. Anyway, good plot, gut renching scene in the forest, I couldn't image that happening to my daughter. I liked the felacio scene, justice is served with a cherry on top. I didn't think it was too gory though, but I am sure MUCH was cut from this Inde Film channel cut of it. Wes did a good job but I still feel NMOES was still his best. We definitely could have done without the stupid ass music. Good Halloween choice, but if you watch with friends you might think it is a little comic. BTW, the cops had to go too, waste of perfectly good film. HeHe Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After going through a difficult time in my life, I wanted a cathartic experience, and thought a notorious video nasty would fit the bill. The film does have 'difficult' subject matter, being rape, and the eventual revenge of her parents. But it doesn't really examine those issues. I found the wierdest thing about the film to be the odd soundtrack, and the comic relief of the two cops. These two elements should have been in a different film, as they never shared scenes with the girls story. The film uses a sentimental set-up, in as that the girls parents are home making a birthday cake for their little girl, whilst she is scoring dope before a rock concert. This is not presented in judgemental terms, she's a nice girl, full of life, likeable. The dope dealers are actually escaped con sadists. The girls are raped, tortured, killed. There is no gratuitous nudity, the rapes happen with a 'subtle' fadeout even. THAT shocked me, this is a video nasty! Still banned in Australia! Don't get me wrong, I didn't want to get off on a rape scene. But I was surprised by the films still strong reputation. The film did stay with me, I thought it was interesting, but I wasn't shocked.</fullReview>

After reading all the reviews I was looking forward to being violated, scared, shocked and disgusted. I was none of them. It was an okay flick. 2 girls get raped and murdered, big deal. It wasn't even that graphic and I got the UNCUT version. This movie does not even compare to Halloween, The Changeling and Texas Chainsaw massacre (which I thought was much more disturbing than LHOTL). Plus the revenge scene at the end was just totally unrealistic. I am not saying it was a bad movie. If you like horror movies I would recommend this movie, but I would not go as far as to say it is as great as some of these reviews that hail this as the greatest horror movie of all time. Tonight I am going to watch Evil Dead. I hope that it won't disappoint me as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overrated Film from an Overrated Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard about this film for years &amp;, as a big fan of horror films, I was really anxious to see it. It was quite a while before I finally managed to see it on video but I finally did so. Last House was supposed to be one of the best horror films ever made--disturbing, scary, frightening. Unfortunately, it was none of those things &amp;, if I had to give it a one-word review, that word would be "unwatchable".Everything in the film is poorly done, from the acting to the directing, to the camera work to the stupid music. Perhaps the worst part is the idiotic "comic relief" of two bumbling sheriffs trying to get somewhere but unable to hitch a ride. Their moronic plight is interspersed with scenes of brutality &amp; torture. Fans of brutality &amp; torture could be rightfully upset that the scenes they had waited to see are being interrupted by comic hijinks while fans of comic hijinks are likely to be nauseated by the torture &amp; brutality. Add to all this the twangy banjo soundtrack &amp; this film could easily make you want to kill yourself.I have always felt that Wes Craven was an overrated director. He's made some good films, but not as many as he is given credit for. This is surely his most overrated film.Note: This review is based on the R-rated Vestron Video version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Any person who saw Scream and Nightmare on Elm Street should steer clear of his one. More to give the viewer a feeling of repultion than to make them enjoy the film. Last House on the Left works in that aspect but does little much else. The killings are brutal, the rape scene is long, and it is anything but a good time as a movie. Hooper would use the same technique of repultion in his Chainsaw Massacre movies but it works a little too well here. It would of been better to see Craven, Cunningham, and Minner to work on a true horror movie than an exercise in repultion. You have been warned. Little fact: Craven also used Hess as the knife welding maniac, Ferret in Swamp Thing 10 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Craven's directional debut is one of the most shocking,vile and disturbing piece of cinema ever made.It shows us how evil and depraved some people can be.Krug,Weasel and Sadie look like normal people but inside they're real sickos.Their victims,two young innocent girls are violently beaten,raped,abused,tortured and finally killed without mercy.This flick is very unpleasant to watch because of its dark,grim atmosphere.Gore is also here,but not too many.If you like this sort of stuff try Michael Haneke's "Funny Games".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is Craven's best. It gives a realistic situation with realistic events and ending. The movie is disturbing... but that's life. The plot is very good and the acting is genuine. This is Craven's first film and one of his most interesting. Not the greatest but very close.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's first flick (years before the over-hyped `Scream') is a very brutal and gritty film that can make even the most hardened of horror buffs cringe in disgust. Complete with graphic rape, humiliation, nudity, torture, and over-the-top violence. Don't get me wrong now, `Last House on the Left' is a very good movie, but it just isn't for everyone. Check it out that is if you think you can handle it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unique mixture of art and expoiltation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if I should bother writing a review but as we can see from the highly contrasting reviews on this site, this film still shocks and annoys people. From the starting, Wes Craven creates an effective sense of the squallid dead lives of the killers that has not been done as well until "Henry Portarit of a Serial Killer". The expolitation begins at the first rape scene which is extremely babdly done with the girls not really tring to get away very hard But the second rape scene is a shocking contrast brutal, disturbing and lyrical. Not resorting to any obvious devices such as jarring music or anoy suspense. Craven creates one of the most despairing scenes in film.Throughout the film it switches tones between when the girls are almost figures of dubious black hyumor, when we sympathize with them and when we feel for the killers. The shocking switches of tone as well as the completely innapropriate music score add to the shocking nature of this brutal film. This film mocks the idea of making a seroius film about it's subject. It is one of the most realistic films about it's subject but yet sees it with a curious distance and nastiness as well amplifying the emotions we feel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A family version of I spit on your grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am shocked to see all the reviews hailing this movie as sick, disturbing, or scary. Sure the subject matter isnt Teletubbie material, but the way it is edited makes it almost comical. The music totally destroys the mood. It mirrors I spit on your grave as far as situation goes, buts lacks Grave's creepy scenes and lack of corny music. I guess you can say it has the Blair Witch quality of trying to scare you with what you dont see, but fails at that as well. The characters are totally unbelievable as well. Who would be stupid enough to have his hands tied behind his back? Or kill their selves on command? Not the worst movie of all time, but not disturbing. Or scary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Undeniably Disturbing, If Not Always Convincing(**SPOILERS**)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Last House on the Left" is just one of those films that is strictly an acquired taste. 95% of people who view this film downright hate it. Well, those people are entitled, but you have to realize that 90% of the people who hate it still think it is sick, disturbing, and brutal. Some people even find it upsetting. And bearing in mind that it is STILL banned in many countries today, and STILL has the effect to disturb people that much, it must be a powerful picture. But don't take my word for it.So I'm sure you've heard all kinds of messed up rumors about this movie. I'm sure you've been warned by a lot of people to stay away from it. I'm sure you've probably even had the desire and curiosity to at least view this film, but couldn't find it anywhere. Well, you're not in the minority. The truth is that this film has such a bad reputation that it is inclined to be dumped on immediately, over and over again. "I Spit on Your Grave" is another prime example of an underrated flick with a horrible rep, yet it is still highly watchable. I don't agree with reviews from people who immediately jump to biased conclusions, or bite off of other people's reviews (an example: the phrase "technically inept", which was originally stated by Leonard Maltin, is repeated on numerous occasions by other reviewers on the Net). When you read a review like that, your best bet would be to ignore it.So my feelings on this film are mixed in the extreme. I'm not saying this is a great movie, I'm not saying you will enjoy this movie, I'm simply saying that this is one hell of a disturbing picture. The first time is the most effective time to watch it. It loses much of it's power with repeat viewings. I must also warn you that some of the aspects of this film are extremely hokey. The dialogue is horrible, the acting styles are none too admirable, and the character of Sadie is just plain ludicrous. She was referred to as "animal-like", but the only animal that comes to mind is a kitty cat. She's not the least bit threatening and she is the epitome of bad acting. Ignore the flaws of her character and you'll roll with it just fine. The story basically begins with the birthday of our main character Mari Collingwood, a pretty, innocent little teenager who is just turning seventeen. Her parents are setting everything up for her party and everybody's all excited. Mari decides that she is going to a Bloodlust concert with her pal Phyllis Stone, another pretty teenager who is unknown to the Collingwood family. After the parents meet Phyllis, she and Mari leave briskly for the concert, having girl to girl chats along the way. This is Craven's way of making us feel for these two girls. Mari talks of changing and her breasts filling out, so later on when the two are meeting their fates, this has a great effect on the audience, who is being bludgeoned with emotions.The two decide to try and score some pot from a guy on the street. At first, he declines, but then it comes to him that his chance has arrived, so he invites the two into his corridor where his three colleagues are waiting in vain. Now we know: These are the vicious prison escapees we heard about earlier over the radio. The guy "with the pot" is the meekly Junior, son of the other guy, the barbaric Krug, who got Junior hooked on heroine to control him. The lady with the messed up hair is Sadie and the mean-looking fellow is Weasel, a mild-mannered lunatic. The girls now realize that they are trapped. Several of them put their hold on Phyllis, ripping her shirt off to expose her breasts, ready to "have some fun" with her. Krug decides to punch her in the gut, causing her to fall to the floor where she is brutally gang raped off camera. Mari has a (artificial) look of fright on her face as she watches in the corner. So the next day the girls are placed in the killers' car trunk and driven away. Once the car breaks down, the murderers decide to take them into the woods and "have some fun". Mari quickly notices that these are the woods right outside her house.The killers quickly immerse themselves into self-gratification, asking Phyllis to urinate in her jeans or they'll cut Mari with a switchblade. At first, she refuses, but once Krug cuts Mari, Phyllis calmly answers the order, making a point to call them "sick mothers". Krug then orders her to remove her pants. Laughing their asses off, the killers grow more sadistic. Krug gets the two together and orders Phyllis to punch Mari as hard as she can in the stomach. They start to plead and Krug gets angry, but Junior steps in to save the day, stating that they should just "make it with each other" instead. So the two are stripped down totally nude and forced to embarrass themselves in front of twisted psychopaths. After that, Krug goes to the car to "get something to cut firewood with" and Phyllis nicely asks Weasel, smothered in ecstacy that he's now in charge, if she can put her clothes back on. He says yes, she does and then bends down to whisper her escape plan to Mari. Mari is crying heavily because Sadie is orally raping her (off camera). That's all I have room to explain, since only 1000 words are permitted. I wrote a complete review that will be posted on my incomplete web site (SEARCH: .44 Magnum Productions). My advice is to quickly pick up a copy of this film and view it to make your own judgment. Chances are that you'll hate it, but still be disturbed by it. *** outta ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Obviously this is not for everyone but if you are at all a fan of movies like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE you can't miss this one. The only major problem is that the Vestron Video release even in it's unrated form is missing bits and pieces. The best release to try and get your hands on is the British and German video releases. These particular ones contain the most complete and uncut version available. If you can't find these DO NOT RENT THE R RATED VERSION. Hunt down the UNRATED VERSION, it can be found. This just happens to be Wes Craven's second film release (the first was a nudie flick called TOGETHER that he made with Sean S. Cunningham). Wes Craven is a master of the horror genre. He does have his ups and downs but this film is by far one of his best. The story deals with two girls who are kidnapped on their way to a rock concert and the rest I'll let you see for yourself. Now the acting is campy 70's Drive-In acting, if you can't get past this don't even bother to watch it. Nonetheless it does have some extremely realistic sequences that will either enthral you or make you shut off the film. The story, I think, is well executed and there is definitely sympathy for the main characters. Plus this movie has the guts to go and do things that you will definitely not see in a late 80's or 90's movie. This film was made in the days when film was still in it's exploration phase. Nowadays everything is so formula that there is definitely no shock value allowed. You can't surprise people anymore. The soundtrack is really cool 70's hippy fare and is actually performed by the main actor David Hess (Krug Stillo) and Steve Chapin, brother of the legendary Harry Chapin (Cats in the cradle). So if youre in the mood for a shocking real life horror film with a cool 70's Drive-In vibe, don't miss this one. Just keep repeating It's only a movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven has created a film ten times more psychologically disturbing than any of his other films. This film is very similar to "I Spit on Your Grave", another rape/torture/revenge film. Wes Craven shows absolutely no sympathy for the victims in the film, and even plays banjo music during the most intense scenes, and contrary to what some think, this is not a mistake or even poor judgement, but rather a brilliant ploy by Craven to show the absolute disregard and desensitivity to the unthinkable atrocities being committed. This film contains some of the most shocking and disturbing scenes ever put to film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another depressingly guilty pleasure in my book!LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT isn't really supposed to be a horror film, but it's a highly disturbing, perverting, and graphic fictional account of murderers decaying precious life. The no-holds-barred advertising campaign made it perfectly clear for those who had the strong will to go see this picture: "CAUTION: To avoid fainting, keep repeating, it's only a movie...only a movie...". They're right! Fans of Wes Craven movies will be disappointed that it's not a high-quality production, and has some low-budget acting routines, but its purpose is strongly effective on a true-to-life point of view. It does compare to a horror film in terms of gore and frightful ways, and the folk music score is an amazing surprise. Look for a young Martin Kove (KARATE KID movies) as a sheriff. Disturbing as it looks and sounds, it's a first, and well done, masterpiece from Craven &amp; Co. Let's hope a "remastered special edition" video release comes around.

As long as the movie stays realistic, the viewing is rather painful, disturbing but the movie remains quite respectable as it never treats murder as a funny subject (though the fascination for graphic violence gets on your nerves a bit towards the end) ; but the movie sometimes turns into a rather parodic area (mostly with the rather-useless-cops' scenes) which doesn't go along terribly with the rest...

		<shortDescription>The Last House on the Left (1972) *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An amateur's ripoff of Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, incompetently shot and mostly incompetently acted. This is a terrible movie. And I don't say that because it glorifies rape, misogyny, torture, and killing... I mean because it's simply a terribly made movie, courtesy of a young Wes Craven (who would later improve for A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET). In a nutshell, two teen-aged girls go off together to see a rock concert but fall into the hands of a twisted group of loafers with no lives, three men and a woman. They bum around all day and get their kicks by torturing and then murdering these young females out in the woods. If that all sounds rather sickening for you, it all depends on your experience with exploitation films of this nature. When originally released in 1972, LAST HOUSE caused many stomachs to churn and even more protesters to pounce. If you're new at this kind of film today, you're likely to be just as offended. However, what was really extreme and over the top sleaze forty years ago does not always resonate these days, especially if you've seen many more of this type. I was too young to catch LAST HOUSE upon its release, but I think it's a film that has been weakened due to the passage of time. But I don't want to give this thing even too much backhanded credit; it's still poorly constructed and edited (especially in the print I saw, an MGM DVD released in 2002 which seems to contradict the manner in which one of the teenage victims had died), and poorly acted for the most part. An exception here might be David Hess, who plays the leading thug of the gang, and looks properly menacing and twisted. Hess also performed some of the soundtrack, which by the way is also lousy and interferes with the goings on. As does some ill-placed comical relief, dulling the edge that some of these atrocities might have had. The vengeful climax of the film should have been way more visual and in your face, but that too is a missed opportunity. George Romero's NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and Tobe Hooper's Texas CHAIN SAW MASSACRE show what two amateur directors with little money were able to accomplish with talent and ingenuity; both those films remain powerfully effective four-star classics of the horror genre today. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is just a piece of non-cinematic crap. * out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another one of those films that were on the Nasties list that so intrigued me some years back. I tracked this down on VHS and was thoroughly disappointed by its crapness. Some years have passed and now it's out on DVD, and having borrowed it from someone I have this to say - I'm still thoroughly disappointed by it's crapness.It's a certain kind of nasty, this one. Like I Spit on Your Grave, it's a revenge flick type thing, where two teenage chicks innocently go looking for grass to take to a party and end up being kidnapped, raped, humiliated and tortured...and killed by this bunch of fugitive criminals. These criminals are led by Krug, who to be honest is a bit of a fud. Joining Krug is Sam, who seems to like rubbing his face with a switchblade, some deviant chick and a goofy looking fella whose name I've forgotten. This guy is one of the many inappropriately funny elements of the film that only succeed in confusing me as to how I'm supposed to feel about what I'm watching.Anyways, Krug and his cronies take the chicks out into the woods and make them do various things, like pee themselves, strip off and make out (that's American for getting off with each other. I hear it sometimes spoken by the goths in Glasgow), erm get raped and lie still while Krug carves his name on their necks (or one of their necks anyways). Once they get bored, they waste the chicks.BUT - wouldn't you know that all this was happening just outside one of the chick's parent's houses. You know the one - the one where her Dad commented about how he could see his daughters nipples and she go and put a bra on just in case some nutters get a hold of her. So Krug et al, cos their car is wrecked, end up in this house (probably the last one on the left), parents find out about the murders, go radge and waste Krug and his pals by slitting throats, biting danglers off, and chainsawing them. Films ends.Except that there's these two cops that are trying to find the chicks, and every time they're on screen we're subjected to more 'hilarious' antics that just made you forget all the other stuff that was going on. I found it so funny I kept accidentally leaning on the fast forward button every time they appeared on screen. Same goes for the hideous cheery hippy music that seemed to belong in another film.With the exception of this last paragraph, you might still be tempted to go out and get this one, but really it's shot so pathetically, scored so craply, and directed so spaticallificallatiously, that there's not even a shock value to be had. It's just a pool of chug spend.I've said it before and I'll say it again: Wes Craven is as talented as a Greggs Pastie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amateur and Overrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A reviewer here said that the Last House on the Left is a film that will either draw awe or ire depending on the viewer's sentiments towards shocking horror. I had neither. Viewing the movie for the first time as a 26-year-old male, I was able to see it in an objective light for what it really was -- an amateur trying his best to be one of his idols.Not to knock Craven too much for his attempt (we all want to mirror our idols some way or another), but this film isn't all that it's been cracked up to be over the past...almost 40 years now? There are no sympathetic characters, no sense of establishing mood or environment, no cohesive plot...just, as I said, an amateur trying to be an icon.While Wes Craven has now established himself as a "Master of Horror", his first film as a director isn't and shouldn't be marked as the highlight of his career. In fact, it would be sad if it truly was. He made many mistakes in this film, from the decisions on music (schlocky, distracting ballads to excruciating sing-along folk songs...sung by the main baddie 'Krug' himself!) to an ending that falls flat due to no proper build-up...although this may have been due to the lack of a decent budget in the first place.All in all, if you are like myself, 26 years old and still haven't seen this movie despite all the word of mouth and hype, I'd say skip it for better movies of that era. If you are younger, maybe just getting into the horror genre, I'd say give it a chance and form your own opinion...in fact, I'd say 99% of the film's apologists are those who saw it when they were 12 years old and found it to be very much unlike most of the cheesy slasher fare that they were used to. It's okay for what it is, basically a student film from a desperate director, but as far as an influential study of revenge and violence in horror, it's far from perfect or original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doesn't quite live up to its notorious and controversial cult classic reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's first foray into the horror genre has been both praised and vilified with equal vehemence throughout the years. While it's way too crude and imperfect to qualify as a true masterpiece, it nonetheless has enough merits to ensure that it isn't a complete wash-out. Instead, this movie wavers betwixt and between being vile, crass, and revolting exploitation trash on one hand and having a relevant and provocative point to make about the intrinsic ugliness and barbarity of violence and how said violence scars, corrupts, and/or destroys all of those who either perpetuate it or are exposed to same. Craven deserves praise for his obdurate refusal to either sanitize or glamorize the unflinchingly graphic and sadistic violence shown herein; the protracted sequence with the two teenage girls being raped, tortured, humiliated, and murdered by the vicious criminal gang in the woods is every bit as horrible, unpleasant, and upsetting as it ought to be, with the single most devastating scene occurring when the gang suddenly realizes the ghastly enormity of what they've done after they kill the two girls. The acting is a decidedly mixed bag: David Hess as savage and sneering gang leader Krug Stillo, Fred Lincoln as the equally ferocious and depraved Fred "Weasel" Podowski, and Jeramie Rain as coarse and abrasive bisexual moll Sadie are all frightfully believable in their absolute baseness and wickedness, Marc Sheffler is genuinely pitiable as Krug's meek and browbeaten heroin addict illegitimate son Junior, Lucy Grantham as the sweet and naive Mari Collingwood and Sandra Cassell as Mari's sassy and more worldly friend Phyllis Stone are likewise credible and appealing, but Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr as Mari's straight-arrow parents both give terribly stiff and unpersuasive performances. Moreover, the clumsy moments of ill-judged humor are embarrassing and woefully out of place; the scene with the two bumbling cops (one of whom is played by future "Karate Kid" movie series regular Martin Kove!) and a toothless old black hag is downright painful to watch. Hess' alternately wonky and melodic score for the most part works; the folks songs in particular are lovely and poignant, but the happy and jaunty bluegrass music that plays during the abduction sequence comes across like a heavy-handed attempt at ironic counterpoint. Victor Hurwitz's rough and plain cinematography greatly adds to the overall gritty documentary-style cinema veritate realism. A severely flawed, but still pretty good and ultimately quite powerful and unsettling picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House on the Left has earned an infamous reputation over the years for its supposed controversial content and brutal violence. I found it to be over-hyped and more of an exploitive low budget B-film than shocking coming across as dated. Furthermore, the movie contained a lot of cheesy dialogue and awful acting. Not that it is a masterpiece by any means but I prefer the remake over the original. A few of the scenes in the movie do work and are startling and dismaying to some extent. The kidnapping of the two girls by the psychotic convicts that the movie centers around is an example. The brutal conflict that takes place towards the end of the movie and the subsequent resolution is also an example. Some people may find this horror movie terrifying and unnerving but I wasn't all that affected by it.

		<shortDescription>So much bad acting, disingenuous dialog's, and gaping logic holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many have raved about this movie. Even Roger Ebert found the film to have unrelenting tension. Well, I miss the bus on this one. I almost stopped watching it because of the cavernous plot and logic holes. But I managed to get to the end for what it's worth. The unrelenting tension I experienced was due more to waiting for something to happen as well as watching some scenes unnecessarily dragging. I mean, there is a point when the viewer can assume the end result of an action rather than having to watch or dwell over the scene to the bitter and obvious conclusion. For example, if you see someone tie a shoe you don't need to watch this until it is positively over with. There many scenes where a good edit could brisk up the pace a bit. Yeah, there is plenty of blood and violence, but it really is simply - uh - stupid...as in it would never happen that way. The acting was variable depending on the character. Of course, the dialog's used frequently did not assist with completing the illusion of realism. Overall, there are no award winning performances here so don't expect any. The soundtrack seemed irrelevant and unsatisfying. Lastly, too much that did occur was convenient - that is, a circumstance is coincidentally allowed in as part of the plot to assist with setting up the next frustrating plot device. Many of these simply weren't worthwhile in the first place. I could go on for a detailed while about this film but I don't do spoilers. Let me just wrap this up concluding that this film was way overrated to me before I finally viewed it. Summation? It was not a fun film, it was not funny, it was frustrating, it is only occasionally interesting, and the plot holes are awesome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific? Yes. A horrific waste of time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speechless... No... Let me gather my thoughts.... This was one of the worst films I've ever wasted my time on. My journey towards this film started with the remake of The Hills Have Eyes, I then watched the original which was worse, and then this. I was told by a friend it was pretty horrific and then after reading the same on here I thought twice about watching. I didn't really want to watch "the most disturbing film I've ever seen" as one reviewer called it, but I thought I'd watch it with a cultural viewpoint and braced myself.Two girls, Mari and Phyllis, set out from their suburban countryside home to travel to New York to see the band Blood Lust in concert. It's all very coming of age, hippyish, and lovely. Mari talks about her breasts getting fuller, she feels like a women. Great stuff... Here I guess Craven is trying to set the mood of innocence but instead what we get is an incredibly boring and annoying first 30mins flicking between the two girls and Mari's parents at home, some really f**king cringey irritating dross. What really ruined this for me is the Music. The soundtrack to this film was absolutely dreadful. We then get Mari and Phyllis arriving in NY were they decide they want to buy some weed and quickly get taken hostage by three deadly rapist murders and their moronic female accomplice. They are taunted, threatened with knives, knocked around, and then stuffed into the boat of a car, all the while to the most abysmal inappropriately placed slapstick comedy music ever. The film continues in the same manner.There were so many awful scenes I can't go thru them all, but one that really stood out is where they are in the woods and Phyllis tries to escape. She has a chance to leg it, and instead of running across the road to what happens to be Mari's parents house she runs in the opposite direction deeper into the forest!! We even have a frame where a road is clearly visible but instead of running for it she runs towards the river!!! All the while cutting back and forth between the girl's attempt to escape and the two bumping idiots, the Laurel and Hardy of the police force, the two most annoying cops ever to grace the silver screen, as they realise they've missed the chance to catch the murderers in some really pathetic comedic scenes. I don't know what Craven was aiming for here. It is beyond me. Is he trying to make us laugh, lighten up the mood? You sicko. I think the scenes with the cops are genuinely supposed to be funny, but they're not, they're just more crap layered on top of the crap we've already been given. I am talking about the scene with the chicken woman here... I could go on, there are so many idiotic lame scenes but I don't want to waste any more of my time.The whole thing is like a farce. I don't know if it is based on a true story as it claims at the beginning, I can not really be bothered to find out now. I don't want to waste any more of my life on this piece of s**t. If it is then shame on you Wes Craven, if it isn't then you should have spent longer on the script.The acting is appalling. Worse than Tromo, and they're not even trying to act seriously. Watch Phyllis as she Ohhs and Ahhs as her friend is cut up and raped.This violence in this film is not horrific, not by today's standards. I'm sure it probably was by early 70s standards but not by today's. Disturbing? No, we've seen worse. Horrifying? Yes, horrifying that anyone could call it a good movie. The beginning was dreadful, the middle was dreadful, and the end was dreadful. Clockwork Orange it ain't. Thanks</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Troubling and disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it came out in 1972,I was 18 years old. To this day Last House on the Left has been the most troubling and disturbing movie that I have EVER seen. This was and has been the only movie that I have walked out on. If I thought the '72 version was mind blowing what must the '09 version be like? I will never know. Wes Craven sees things in a different way than other people. What happened to the original cast? Were any available for the 2009 version? Where did Mr. Craven get the idea for this movie? Why would someone want to re-do it? Where did the movie take place? I remember very vividly the scene where the Mother bit the genitals off. YUK!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Powerful Movie Ever Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After looking in depths of horror, into the old and the new, the cult and the popular; Last House on the Left is the most powerful movie ever made. While there are certain scenes that may not fit the film, such as the scenes with the comedy cops, but that doesn't take away from the films impact overall.Everything about this movie is brilliant. Some of the actors may be better than others. Fortunatly, the villains are made up of the best actors in the movie, David Hess especially. David Hess made this movie feel brutally real and violent.The rape scenes in this movie may not be explicit, but everything is still as powerful as the violence of life. Last House on the Left is truly one of the most powerful exploitation film because it exploits the power of real life violence. This movie doesn't encourage violence towards women, it encourages the exact opposite.The movie also has a haunting soundtrack which can make you shed tears while watching the movie. Last House on the Left is one of the few movies to actually send me into tears.I recently seen that they were remaking this movie. The trailer looks like it will be absolute rubbish.FOR MORE HORROR REVIEWS, CHECK OUT MY YOUTUBE PAGE HORRORREVIEWS123</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember when Last House on the Left came out and the commercials urging audience members to repeat 'It's only a movie ... it's only a movie.' Back then I was not inclined to see horror films, and the movie looked far too bloody, dark and disturbing for my taste. So I avoided seeing it until last night. Maybe it was the years of build-up, or horror fan friends of mine saying this was the 'best horror movie EVER.' Maybe it's the fact that I've seen a lot of horror films in the past few years. But I found LHotL to be one of the dumbest things I've ever seen. Okay, okay, I know. It was 'seminal' in a lot of ways, and Wes Craven 'went on to do great things' (debatable) after this one. I know that the zeitgeist has changed dramatically since 1972, as has film technique/technology, acting styles and everything that goes along with and into making a film. I know that it was difficult to get funding and good actors for a film that was horror and showed bare breasts (two things that have been oddly paired in this kind of movie) back then. But come on. The acting is ridiculous, even when it's supposed to be 'real.' The script reads like something straight out of an 8th grader's English project. Two things I enjoyed: the songs in the soundtrack and the fact that it seems a real chainsaw is being used toward the end (you can see actual cuts on the chair and desk). I would recommend other movies far, far above this one if one wants to see 'the most disturbing horror film ever.' Into that category I would have to place 'Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer,' a movie that disturbed and haunted me for months after I'd seen it. I actually regret seeing it - it is that bleak and nihilistic. For a movie that blends comedy and horror one can not do better than Jodorowski's Santa Sangre, a gleeful, bloody, horrifying, hilarious Fellini-esquire take on the Psycho tale. For a dissolution of 'family values' done up in bloody horror one is much better off with Miike's 'Visitor Q.' (Be prepared if you rent and watch this one - there is virtually no social taboo not exploited in Visitor Q) For a similar (although much milder) and far superior movie from the same era, I recommend 'Homebodies.' But I have to say, all the comments praising Last House on the Left as being some sort of work of genius truly have me scratching my head. I found it hard to watch - not because it was disturbing, but because it was so darned bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mari Collingwood (Sarah Cassell) and long time friend Phyliss (Lucy Grantham) are two innocent teenage girls who are out for fun, Mari has a 17th birthday coming up and they are on their way to a rock concert. Unfortunately they get lost in the city as they are kidnapped by three insane escaped criminals named Krug (David Hess), Weasel (Fred J.Lincoln) and Sadie (Jeramie Rain) whom are raped, tortured and murdered. Later, after the parents of Mari find out that they are dead they vow revenge on those that killed them.A vicious, cold-hearted and dark look into the nature of crime from writer-director Wes Craven who made his debut movie with this shockfeast. This movie caused a fuss when it premiered in 1972 despite being a hit, the film nearly got an "X" rating but was cut for a bit to earn an "R" rating but audiences nearly faint at the sight of this motion picture on it's realistic nature. David Hess steals the show as Krug whom is one of the most unlikable baddies to ever grace of the horror screen, the film was produced by a young Sean S. Cunningham ("Friday The 13th" and "House 1986") and the film was condemned by most critics as trash except Roger Ebert whom was brave enough to sit through the picture. Yes the acting is bad but the film delivers a chilling journey into the mind as it kicks you right in the gut then tears your soul into pieces, it's a hard to watch but very good horror thriller that is a shocking powerhouse.Also recommended: "Maniac (1980)", "I Spit on Your Grave", "House of 1000 Corpses", "The Devil's Rejects", "The New York Ripper", "High Tension", "The Hills Have Eyes (1977 and 2006)", "The Hitcher (1986)", "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974)", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre part 2", "Borderland", "Leatherface: Texas Chainsaw Massacre part III", "Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer", "Mother's Day", "A Nightmare on Elm Street", "Scream", "Hostel 1 &amp; 2", "Men Behind The Sun", "Funny Games (1997)", "The Toxic Avenger", "House on The Edge of the Park", "Inside (2007)", "Black Christmas (1974)", "Halloween (1978)", "Night Train Murders", "Frontier(s)", "Cannibal Holocaust", "Faces of Death", "Wrong Turn", "Otis", "Grindhouse", "The Untold Story", "Ichi The Killer", "Driller Killer" and "Texas Chainsaw Massacre (2003)".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is one of the most notorious of the infamous Video Nasties that were banned in the UK during the early 1980's. It has achieved a large cult following and is revered by many horror fans. The film is the first feature by Wes Craven and is loosely based on Inger Bergman's 1960 film "The Virgin Spring". In brief the film centers on two girls, called Mari &amp; Phyllis, who on their way to a rock concert are kidnapped by four recently escaped criminals. During their abduction they are raped, sexually humiliated, tortured, mutilated, disembowelled and finally murdered by their captors. Once the ordeal is over the criminals then look to a married couple they stumble upon for help and accommodation, it just so happens that this couple live in the last house on the left. It soon transpires that they are the parents of one of the girls murdered and unbeknown to the escaped criminals the parents execute a bloody revenge.Such is the notoriety of the film that upon its initial release in Britain in 1974, the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) gave it an outright ban with them making clear that cuts would make no difference. Not only was the film not allowed to be screened in Britain, but Canada, Australia and New Zealand also banned it. However, and as mentioned earlier, the film did manage to become available on video in the early 80's but this was before the Video Recordings Act in 1984. This Act led to it featuring predominantly on the Director of Public Prosecutions top 60 'Video Nasty' list. The film also managed to achieve 113 convictions under the Obscene Publication Act in the UK between 1983 and 1987; yes One Hundred and Thirteen! In 1999 the film was again submitted to the BBFC, but this time they demanded that over 2 minutes of cuts were required. The distributors, loyal to their work, declined and the film was rejected a release. It was then re-submitted in 2001, this time the BBFC demanded 16secs to be cut. The distributors appealed, but unfortunately lost and the BBFC (now clearly annoyed) upped it to 32 seconds. As far as I am aware the uncut version is still unavailable in the UK so those that wish to purchase a copy should visit an American online store.Controversy aside, it's worth taking note of the trailer for the film as it invites the viewer to relish the words "It's only a movie, it's only a movie...". In quintessential horror fashion the trailer teases the audience with its fiction; something that would later be parodied by Craven himself in "Scream". Those that have seen the film will understand how Last House on the Left is a film that embodies a deep and disturbing insight into the extremes of abduction and female humiliation. It is a horrific film and through being so horrific it perfectly epitomizes the very genre it is, a horror. I have huge admiration for this film, given its young director Wes Craven and producer (Sean S. Cunningham; Creator of the Friday 13th series) and the mere fact it really did push the boundaries of cinema. It can be argued that the acting is poor and the script bad, but the grittiness of the film stock combined with the poor acting and dialogue ironically make for a superb film, interestingly the very qualities that made Grindhouse cinema respected and adored.I have seen this film many times and from my experience women will find it hardest to watch. It is not a film for the faint hearted and it does not rely on heavy chords or lots of suspense. Its effectiveness lies in the simplicity of the story. Albeit a story that is hard to digest, due to perhaps audience members finding it difficult to differentiate themselves from those on screen i.e. it's all too real. Furthermore given the films year horror movie clichés are avoided, in fact they are established leading me to believe that in 1972 the film was ahead of its time.Finally I can't escape that the film was cut in the UK, cutting a film is comparable to obscuring part of painting, or tearing out pages of a book as it removes what the artist, writer or director intended which is ultimately restricting freedom of expression and freedom of speech. Those that do manage to get hold of an uncut copy could be disappointed as they might not have the patience for such an archetypal horror, as it does not live up to today's standards. However, horror connoisseurs, film academics and those that take a genuine interest in film and its history will probably be the only ones that will truly appreciate Last House on the Left and what it means to the modern horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film starts out slow. Then packs a punch and dozen 't let up. It is shocking,raw,brutal,terrifying,and jaw dropping. Hard to believe it was made in the 70's it is terrifying now, back then people must've fainted. Seriously I had to repeat "Its only a movie" in some parts of the horrific torture scene. It felt so real and the fact that it is based on a true story made it even more frightening. Its about 2 teens, one who just turned 17, go on a trip to a Bloodlust concert in New York. To lighten up festivities they try to score some pot. Which leads them into the pit of 3 deranged escaped psychos and a dope fiend, JR. They think everything's cool, but then they are beaten and raped. Then the psychos tie up the 2 girls and put them in the trunk of their car and drive,then their car breaks, right near Mari's house. They decide to start the torture in the woods. They force one of the girls to pee her pants. Then she makes a run for it in a terrifying, nerve shredding scene. The killers catch her and she meets her gruesome end! Then they rape and torture Mari, pretend to let her go, then shoot her twice. After that the killers and JR. seek shelter. They go to the last house on the left. Mari's parents have no idea that the people they just welcomed in their home are the killers of their daughter. When they find they decide to exact bloody revenge. They set traps and lead each killer to a vicious and gruesome death, slowly and precisely exacting their anger and rage. You won't believe your eyes! Not for the faint of heart. If you enjoy films like "Hostel" and "captivity" this is your type of film. I warned you! TO AVOID FAINTING KEEP REPEATING "ITS ONLY A MOVIE, ...ONLY A MOVIE". Take a breather for this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the most disturbing movies of all time. The legends Sean (Friday the 13th) Cunningham and Wes (A Nightmare On Elm Street) Craven collaborated on this corner stone of the exploitation sub-genre.This movie is gritty and dirty and makes me feel like I need a shower after viewing it. "Why," you ask, "Why did you give this a high rating if it evokes such negative emotion?" The negative emotion the film evokes is what makes me like this movie so much! The film is real and hits hard. The two main characters which we grow to care about get raped, humiliated, and then killed. Leaving us feeling hopeless. But by the end of the movie when the parents get there revenge on the murderers you find yourself cheering gleefully on the inside as Dad takes a chainsaw to the murderers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deserves comparison with Clockwork Orange as one of the truly traumatic film experiences of all time. This sense of violence for fun without remorse is hard to capture well on film, but Craven does it. It was very hard to watch, but extremely well directed. The true horror of this film is Krug, played by David Hess.Another traumatic film experience that comes close to matching this one is the boat scene on Cape Fear. What makes all of these scenes so much more than horror is the plausibility factor: It could happen to you or to a woman you love. Another parallel to Cape Fear is the degree to which a horrible person can enter your own safety zone so easily.The 'Keystone Kops' aspect of the chase is the one flaw in the film. But even there, the statement by the filmmakers that cops cannot be counted on to defend you is worth making.I did my best here to only discuss generic aspects of the film and not reveal any plot outcomes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Last House on the Left" is one of the best and one of the very first horror movies. Taking a realistic approach, this film is about 2 teenage females looking to buy some grass before heading to a concert. Not using their judgement correctly, they are taken hostage, raped and murdered by a gang of escaped convicts. I don't want to spoil the rest of the story, but it takes an interesting turn after another. This film is dark and gritty, with a classic soundtrack, and believable performances. This film is also very ironic. Taking place during the peace and love generation, there is an evident battle between good and evil and who will reign. But most viewers wont even see this, but they will notice the dated look of the film. The only complaint is the during some sadistic parts, it is intercut with slapstick comedy. It may be confusing, and unsettling to some viewers, but it is one of the ironic moments this film takes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven at his bloody best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took me years to earn the patience and restraint to sit through this movie. When I was twelve I tried watching it but the beginning bored me and I turned it off, This happened about six times until I turned about 15, then I sat down and saw a masterwork by a master of horror. Wes Craven could have done this died and been a legend, but luckily he has went on to make some classics, The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare On Elm Street, The People Under the Stairs, Wes Craven's New Nightmare, Scream and Red Eye are his best. He has also done some utter crap, Swamp Thing, Chiller, Deadly Friend, and Shocker, avoid these. Everything else is pretty mediocre. But Last house is awesome and in his top six for me because it seems so real, as if this horror could happen in your own back yard and that is why this film endures and will keep doing so long after it's remake has crashed and burned in a couple of years. David Hess is the main reason to see this as in this he symbolizes the face of modern horror and makes real even more so than the overly hyped Halloween with Michael Myeres. With David Hess he does not need to hide his face to show evil he has it in his eyes. The first time you see him in this movie you know the girls are in trouble. His gang are equally crazy too but in different ways, Sadie is like a crazed dog off the leash that is just about to slash your throat, Fred is the kind of creep you would see walking at the back of an alleyway waiting to rape you, and Junior is a likable guy who just does not realize what his into. I love this movie and it is well worth the watch, see this.</fullReview>

It was overlooked therefor released but it was never intended for audiences 2 see this movie, this also happened 2 Tobe Hooper on the original Texas Chainsaw massacre so he cut out all the blood and gore therefor releasing a virtually bloodless but scary movie. Let me know what you think. I absolutely LOVE this movie and think it is a masterpiece, one of Cravens best. Even the way it's shot is just scary</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stands alone as one of the greatest horror movies ever made, the plot is ingenious and the story is perfectly over the top. It's about two teenage girls who are planning to go to a rock concert but instead have a shocking journey into the heart of evil when three escaped convicts kidnap and torture them (krug,weasel and Sadie with the help of Krug's son Junior). The actors involved are raw and powerful characters, Krug is played by David Hess who also done the soundtrack. Weasel is played by Fred J. Lincoln, who is a prolific director of adult movies and Sadie is played by Jeramie Rain who is now a writer. A true horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"What the hell?" If this wasn't the exact sentiment that crossed my mind after viewing "Last House on the Left" for the first time, it will be close enough for the purpose of this review. "What the hell," I wondered, as I hit 'stop' and then 'rewind' on the old Vestron VHS rented from my local Blockbuster. "What the hell was THAT all about?" I was appalled, disgusted, and offended beyond belief. And hey, I'm the type of person who (more often than not) ADORES cinema that pushes the boundaries of taste with reckless abandon (at the time, my interest was heavily vested in the likes of Tarantino and "Natural Born Killers"). But something about "Last House on the Left" barreled past a moral limit I had no idea I possessed and dragged it through the mud without consent. This was NOT the Wes Craven of the wholesome, critically-acclaimed "Scream" films (which I liked at the time, and still respect), but some low-rent hack who seemed to pride himself on all the shock tactics he could parade in front of a camera.Years passed, and something compelled me to give "Last House" another look (strangely similar to the way I re-appraised Craven's sophomore effort, "The Hills Have Eyes"); in the meantime, I had become a novice viewer of the more well-known Italian horrors (namely Fulci and Argento), and my taste overall had shifted toward the obscure. This, I think, is why "Last House" clicked with me the second time around (though the passing of age might have helped, also); while I was previously a passive consumer of more mainstream horror, my newfound inclination towards the hidden gems of the genre energized my viewing. I WANTED to see something subversive, something appalling, something I hadn't seen before.Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is a free-spirited hippie girl who has just turned 17, the fine ripe age for rebellion; to celebrate her birthday, Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham) takes her to the city for a Bloodlust concert. In their search for some marijuana, they are accosted by a gang of sadistic thugs who staged a prison break earlier that day. Krug (the legendary David Hess), Junior (Marc Sheffler), Weasel (Fred Lincoln), and Sadie (Jeramie Rain) kidnap the girls, take them out to the woods after their car breaks down, and subject them to humiliation, rape, torture, and murder. While this template became popular among the low-budget exploitation films that would follow, it really originates with "The Virgin Spring," Ingmar Bergman's tale of lost innocence, vengeance, and murder. That Craven chose this film as his inspiration is indicative of the higher intellect at hand, and the timing of "Last House"?at the tail end of the hippie era, and shortly after the Manson massacre?is the perfect marker of a generation in transition."Last House on the Left" is as much a horror film as it is a juxtaposition of extremes in general: from gender roles to generational politics, the role of authority (here presented in a deliberately foolish and comedic manner), sexual awakening (and its subsequent degradation), and the clash of cloistered suburb against urban squalor. If the film is an amalgamation of a variety of different themes, then it is fitting?if confounding?that "Last House," coming at the beginning of the '70s, plays like a grab-bag of cinematic technique. Like 1974's "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" (or even 1969's "Easy Rider," for that matter), "Last House" is an incendiary work that succeeds due to what it doesn't have; with such low budgets, these films were either destined for celluloid oblivion or cult classic status. Rife with close-ups, unknown actors, locations both gritty and rustic, shaky hand-held camera, and a picture that is often poorly framed (which was probably unintentional, but carries a grittily unprofessional effect that augments the reality of things), "Last House" shoves its intentions in our face, without shying away from the evil of which human beings are capable.Despite the fact that some of Craven's decisions (the inclusion of the police in particular) are questionable, he rivets us to the screen with a horror that, to this day, is still unnerving.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SCREW The Poseidon Adventure, THIS is the best movie of 1972.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first movie by famous director Wes Craven, who brought us gems such as 'The Hills Have Eyes', 'Nightmare On Elm Street', and 'Scream'.It's an adaptation of 'Jungfrukallan' (Virgin Spring), an Ingmar Bergman movie (in short, it's a remake the way 'Poseidon' is 'Poseidon Adventure''s... oh the irony): two young women, Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham) end up in the lair of two escaped sadistic sexual abusers and murderers, Krug (David Hess) and Fred Potowski (Fred Lincoln), and are brought in the woods near Mari's home (that wasn't the destination, though; the car has broken down) to be used, abused, and finally murdered by them and their female accomplice, Sadie (Jeramie Rain), one of the most repulsive-looking women I have ever seen, while Krug's son Junior (Marc Sheffler) whom Krug seems to have abused too, to the point of getting him addicted to heroin to be better controlled, can do nothing but watch. Then those repulsive people ask for hospitality to none other than Mari's parents, who end up finding out the truth about their daughter's disappearance and get a bloody revenge...This is probably one of the scariest horror movies ever, especially because this isn't a Grand Guignol blood fest (Texas Chainsaw Massacre) or an abstract, supernatural story (most horror movies, especially those with some 'hockey player' who should just rest in pieces...), but shows violence for what it is; disgusting, sad, evil.And like the scariest horror stories, it could happen to you (even if you're male).</fullReview>

Last House on the Left, however is in a class of its own, nothing before or since can compare to the surreal nature of this film. I can't imagine how it ever made it to the screen, and even now I have a hard time dealing with the memories of the scenes that were presented.

		<fullReview>This movie was disgusting and unlike my title suggests I didn't cry. I did cry, however, in the deleted scenes.I bought the DVD one day, looking for a movie to scare me and i heard good (or bad from some peoples perspective)things about this movie. So I watched it and fell in love with it, it was disgustingly horrible but it was well filmed, acted, directed and everything else and i did like the whole 70's vibe about it. Anyway, I started watching the special features and oh my God i watched the deleted scenes and I had my DVD remote in my hand, and I didn't take my eyes off the screen. Instead I started to cry and yell at the screen "WHY? WHY ARE YOU DOING THAT TO THAT GIRL? WHY? YOU INHUMAN F%@$'S" and i eventually looked away but i couldn't stop watching for some reason. I'm so glad it wasn't in the movie.As I said before the acting, directing, and cinematography are excellent. The lighting was amazing for the budget and it was a delight to watch.The ending is the Jewel of this crown of dread. The killers who we now loath so much we could shoot the screen, have stumbled into the house of one of the girls they have killed and, wouldn't you know it, the parents find out. Then the killers get it just as bad as the girls did(including the infamous were one of the killers survives but with his condition I would rather be dead).I started watching this movie with one of my friends who gets terrified by horror movies (although he sat through Signs with out flinching and I had night mares for a week) and he had to leave right before the scary stuff happened. I told him that next day that he was lucky he did because he would have s*** his pants.Botttom Line:Great slasher (if you could call it that) that shows hints of were other movies like it got their ideas.

Look at any number of films today and you'll see what I mean - rap stars going out and 'poppin' caps in asses' because they mean well in their own way!?!? By allowing the audience to feel repulsed I think Craven did the best thing possible and put forth the ultimate wake up call that violence is real and nasty and that things like this do actually happen.Bit more gore would be better though, like guts and stuff............ and chicken - fried chicken!</fullReview>

The rather unknown actors, the hapless direction, the cheap equipment, the (I hope) deliberately butt-ugly cinematography, the brilliant soundtrack, they all add to the power of this low-budget gem. There are also some really bizarre dialogues involved, it's like here and there they're actually going for a bit of comedy. Intertwining brutal murder scenes with footage of a middle-aged couple baking a pie, I don't know why that's funny, it just is. The slapsticky police officers don't work as well, but they do add to the general "what the hell am I watching"-factor of this movie. While were at it, the "chicken lady" crackes me up too, most random character ever. This movie is extremely rough around the edges, but in a whole other way it's also Wes Craven at his best.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham working together on the same film, it must be great, right? Well, this movie is...different to say the least. Not necessarily a horror film, it certainly has horrible moments, which is understandably why it got labeled as one of the "Video Nasties".What is presented to us in the Last House on the Left, the film with the famous tag line 'To avoid fainting keep repeating "it's only a movie...only a movie...only a movie..."' is what could essentially be described as the story of Mari (played by Sandra Cassel), whose birthday went horrible wrong when she and her friend wound up with the wrong crowd, and the disturbing, emotional and heavy events that follow, which may or may not answer the question of how far a parent would go for their child. Too far, perhaps? The acting is great, particularly from David Hess as Krug, Jermaine Rain as Sadie, Marty Kove as the Deputy, Gaylord St James as Dr. Collingwood, and especially Cynthia Carr, as Estelle Collingwood. And what is with the music? You think you're watching a harmless family film as the soundtrack, at least on the surface, seems to have very little to do with the film, until you reach the Last House on the Left that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a landmark in the kinds of things movie makers could get away with. Yes, it stretched the boundaries and paved the way for scenes in later movies, but it is not necessarily a masterpiece. Unfortunately, it suffered quite a bit from the era it was made in... the early 70's. This is seen in the often poor and strange soundtrack and the really horrible audio (although those problems are still often problems today).What this movie does very, very well is create suspense throughout. There are moments of relief, but they are few and far between. The suspense in this film is masterful.The comic relief provided by the sheriff and his deputy are often cartoonish and dumb, but fortunately, they are not seen much.This is probably not a movie I will watch again... just because there's better things I want to do with my time and more movies I would rather see... but I do appreciate the suspense this film brought me and the way it opened the doors for other films to come.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is the directorial debut of Wes Craven who would make movies that dared you to watch. The horror genre welcomes a genius. Dark, brutal and controversial. Two girls, Mari(Sandra Cassel)and Phyllis(Lucy Grantham)are on their way to a concert and want to score some marijuana and end up tortured, raped and humiliated by a group of escaped convicts. The group led by Krug Stillo(David Hess)decide to "lay low" in the nearby home of one of their victims. Mari's parents soon deduce that these three strange strangers are responsible for their daughter's disappearance. In spite of their fear, the emotional parents are ready to deal out their own brand of revenge. This movie was first rated "X", but some arm twisting and clippings of the film footage deleted and added back garnered an "R" rating. Also in the cast: Fred Lincoln, Jeramie Rain, Gaylord St. James and a young Martin Kove.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Over 10 years before Elm Street began, Craven was already creating fear, disgust, invention and controversy, particularly with The Last House on the Left, a notoriously banned film which, like most banned films is graphic more in theme than content. For its time though, it was heavy stuff, rape, murder, mutilation, torture, sadism, revenge, chainsaws...The film begins calmly enough, with two teenage girls going out together to a rock concert, we watch them getting ready at one of their houses with one set of parents telling them to be careful, have a good time etc. However, after looking for pot before the concert the girls are kidnapped by a group of sadistic escaped criminals including Krug, the leader, and his apparent girlfriend Sadie. The girls are then raped, tortured, and eventually killed in brutal ways. Craven directs these scenes so that they are almost unbearable to watch even though we don't see much, and the performances of the cast are excellent. Even after the deaths the killers seem to realise what they have done and there seems to be some sort of confusion in their eyes, if not remorse. Then in a Bergman-esquire twist, the killers' car breaks down and they look for help at a nearby house which just happens to be the Collingwood home, where the parents of one of their victims live. They have called the police as their daughter has not returned home, and unwittingly invite the maniacs in. Soon though each group recognises the other, and the parents go about their bloody revenge using a variety of dentistry and home improvement tools to full, gripping effect.Like The Hills have Eyes, it is fascinating to watch how a middle class family with strong values etc can quickly become executers when provoked, to see how any person can become a monster in the 'right' circumstances. There are no happy endings here, no moral justification, just revenge pure and simple. The film is set up in every way to disturb, from the infamous trailer, the Texas Chainsaw style 'based on a true story' effect, and the scenes of torture and murder themselves. Krug and co. and thoroughly evil and take great joy in the pain of others, but they quickly change face when bearing down upon a gun or chainsaw. The film is almost entirely grim and grainy although there are some funny moments involving the cops and a chicken farmer. There is some average acting, and it will be too unbearable for some. This should definitely be seen, but do not be expecting a bright affair, you will be uncomfortable throughout.7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left" is a totally brutal movie. Its graphic and violent and in my opinion it has an amazing ability to make you feel completely uncomfortable. The production values are at the minimal level, and the acting is okay, but the real star here is the high doses of violence and terror, even to the point that it is almost impossible to watch. Having forced myself to keep going, I found the irony to be very original: the killers happen to come across the house of one of the girls that they killed and her parents give them hospitality until they overhear them talking about killing their daughter!! Then the parents exact a violent revenge on the killers, turning 'them' into the victims. Hell yeah! Kill those sorry SOB's! This movie should disturb you in one way or another, and either you will come to respect it for what it is, or you will totally hate it like I did when I first saw it. But I've seen it twice since my first viewing and I realize now that it is truly sick...and I like that.And if you find yourself faint as you are watching then just keep repeating to yourself that "it's just a movie, it's just a movie"!!! :) 7/10 is my rating</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Almost everyone who reviews this film talks about how un-even it is. They're right, but I think it is that way intentionally. Basically the story revolves around a bunch of cartoonish escaped convicts who suddenly become viciously cruel and kidnap two girls on their way to a concert. No film had really gone as far in its depiction of violence as this one when it was released, and by the time the credits rolled, I for one had a hard time shaking off the images. More jaded viewers may be disappointed by the lack of gore, or the absence of a masked killer (Last House is frequently compared to Texas Chainsaw...it is nothing like it). A lot of people criticize the music in the film as being out of place. I thought it worked nicely as a counterpoint. I think what Wes Craven was going for in this film was kind of the shocking humor/horror vibe that Tarantino has sort of mastered in later years. It is an experiment that doesn't always work, but the violent scenes are so shocking that the flat humor won't really detract from the effect of the film. I thought Hess's music was great, and really captured the disillusion of the era. I'm also surprised I haven't seen the actress who played Mari Collingwood in any other films, she is really talented. In fact, her performance is what anchors the film in reality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I cannot believe how BAD this movie is. I'd been led to believe that, like Tobe Hooper's TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE, Wes Craven's first feature was supposed to be one of his best. It's not. I do like some of Craven's other films, like THE PEOPLE UNDER THE STAIRS and THE HILLS HAVE EYES, but watching this reminded me more of the crap that he typically churns out, like SHOCKER, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET (c'mon - Freddy is just Shecky Greene with claws) or any of those direct-to-cable stinkers his name seems to turn up on with a producer credit on a regular basis. The acting is almost totally unconvincing. (At the end, when the sheriff comes in I almost expected the mother to offer him some more birthday cake.) The plot is so indescribably preposterous that words fail me. (Let's just say that the ridiculous coincidences pile up faster than cowpies on a dairy farm.) The music is so at odds with the action (and not in an appropriately ironic way) that it beggars the mind - and that's not to mention the "comic" relief of the inept sheriff and deputy. And worst of all is Craven's utterly amateurish directing and editing. I've seen better films made by 6-year-olds with digital video cameras. (And Craven hasn't really improved that much over the years.) You want to see a movie of this ilk that still packs a punch after the same (approximate) amount of time? Watch I SPIT IN YOUR GRAVE. THAT'S a good exploitation film that transcends the limits of the genre. THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT...utter crap. Wes Craven wishes this was shocking. It's not. It's boring. And to avoid boredom (and believe me, it was SO hard not to press fast-forward through so much of this film), keep repeating to yourself, "Hit the Eject button. Hit the Eject button..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House on the Left (1972) is one of the most dark, twisted and frightening movies ever made. Shot on 16mm, the movie has the feel of a snuff film. Wes Craven set the bar high and only a few movies have even come close to it. Krug has to be the nasty villain to ever appear upon the silver screen. He drips with scuzz, sleaze and death. A depressing tale about how sick psychopaths are and how far people will go to get revenge. Craven and Cunningham revamp an old Swedish folk tale "The Virgin Spring" and give it an early 70's spin upon it, in the process they manage to create one of the most disturbing films in the history of cinema. Sadly, due to years of editing and mistreatment there is no definite cut of L.H.O.T.L. Many of these scenes were edited either by the distributors or the film-makers themselves. This picture launched the careers of Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham and created a cult star out of David A. Hess (he would reprise different variations of his Krug character in future films).Highly recommended for horror film fans. This movie falls into the category of what I would call an initiation film for true fans of horror flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong early no-budget exploitation from a true master (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven has been involved in a variety of horror movies. Along with John Carpenter and Sean Cunningham (who produced "Last House"), Craven ushered in the slasher film in the 80s, and horror has never been the same. Before he started doing slasher movies, however, Craven worked on a number of different movies, including "Swamp Thing," "The Hills Have Eyes," and "Last House on the Left."Best likened to Peckinpah's classic "Straw Dogs," "Last House" is a no-budget movie literally shot in the backyard of Cunningham's house in Connecticut. It's a fairly typical exploitation/revenge movie, except for the performance of one David Hess.Hess' Krug Stillo is perhaps the most effective portrayal of a slimy, street-smart, patriarchal serial killer and rapist that I have ever seen (okay, so there aren't many characters like that, but who cares?). With wicked smiles and genuinely menacing dialogue, Hess' performance makes Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter look like a pansy. Simply put, you would never want to meet Krug anywhere, let alone a dark alley. This is all the more amazing given that Hess is such an easygoing guy in real life.Craven's camera work and sense of pace is very strong even this early in the game - the shots are realistic without ever being MTV-like or jarring like other low budget movies (*cough* Blair Witch Project *cough*). The story is all about the generation gap and how people can become killers when they are faced with killers. In "Last House," the WWII generation parents are sweet at the beginning of the movie, but at the end, they've taken on several psychotic killers...and won. "The greatest generation," indeed.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I picked this up with some of my graduation money because it was Wes' first film. I thought, you know, I could get the family together and we could all watch a nice little horror film. Damn! I had no idea Wes Craven was ever involved in some thing like this! Luckily, because my brother was impaitent at the pace, music, and film quality, we had to stop as soon as they first cut to the gang of murderers...BEFORE THEY KILLED ONE HIPPIE! Anyway when I did get to watch this movie with my mother it shocked her enough to walk out. I kept my eyes one it for the historical interest, but still had a hard time watching it. I watch horror movies all the time, and can usually endure even the most lurid sequences, but this movie still made my stomach cringe.Maybe its because the villains are shown to be so human, and they are torturing people just as shallow and just as ethical as any girl you'd meet next door, and the torture is so graphic, man's inhumanity to man you know-- makes this so much more terrifying than any of the super-natural horror the filmmakers make later in their careers.Nevertheless, Craven develops themes that would reappear frequently in his later work: incompetent, almost humorous cops; brave teenage heroine; physcotic killers etc. The structure, if not the content, of the film isn't altogether out side mainstream Judeo-Christian morality-- in fact it is a lesson in paternal ethics that some of todays youth (and their parents) would do well to learn. Bill Bennet would approve.Footnote: In the direction the killers are going in, the house where the killers meet their fate would be on the right hand side.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is Wes Craven's directorial debut and hailed as one of the scariest horror films ever made. It's a very disturbing film but not as scary as I expected. The subplot about the cops is really uninteresting and the dialogue is very bad at times. I'm not too sure about the acting of the criminals, they fit the profile but I never feel they're that menacing. I don't even want to comment on the performances of the parents, it's that bad. The best performance (if you want to call it that) of the film is by Sandra Cassel who plays Mari. You can tell she is truly scared out of her mind. As they said in the DVD documentary, "she takes method acting to another level." What I admirer about the movie is that it never pulls back, it takes it story all the way. Some may call it exploitive but the violence is never glamorized. I like the fact that the criminals are portrayed as still having some humanity and that Mari's parents are shown as having an evil side. I hate it when a revenge picture celebrates the victim's vengeance. I think when a human being succumbs to that evil side it should never be treated as a good thing but a sad and unfortunate event. The parent's killing of the murderers is the most frightening moment and most compelling aspect of Last House on the Left.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Last House on the Shelf (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've damn near given myself a nervous breakdown trying to surmise my feelings on the tawdry little film, going through draft after draft of meaningless arguments for and against this so-called controversial classic. However, regardless of my prolonged manifestation of writer's block I have finally come to a conclusion, and that is; that The Last House on the Left is a bad film... pure and simple. Here is a movie that hides its underlined exploitatation behind a pretence of documentary realism. This makes it all the more detestable. The story, if you can call it that, follows two teenage girls from the countryside embarking on a trip to the big city to see a band called, of all things, Blood Lust. Needless to say... they never make the gig.Instead, having tried to score some grass from an obvious smack-fiend, they are kidnapped, driven into the woods and repeatedly raped, tortured, abused and ridiculed before finally being hacked to pieces or, in the case of the lead girl, forced to wade out into the lake where she is shot in the back of the head. Now, there's a lesson for you kids, if you're gonn'a buy drugs from a sweaty, strung-out hustler then for god's sake don't follow him into his apartment... the fact that the one of the two girls is supposedly familiar with this part of town makes you wonder how she could make such a stupid error of judgement... unless by 'familiar with' they meant in the same way that director Craven is 'familiar' with art of filmmaking.Scenes of sexual violence and narcissism are composed to a lovely folksy soundtrack by lead scumbag himself David A. Hess (who where you expecting, Bob Dylan?). Now, in all honesty Hess is a pretty talented musician, and in fairness I would seriously think about buying the film's soundtrack album. However, when you couple songs like Wait for the Rain and All Alone with scenes of rape, torture and mutilation the effect it has is so jarring that we are immediately whisked out of the moment. Now Craven has argued that the music was used in this way to give the film a more sinister underlining -- think of how Kubrick used Beethoven in A Clockwork Orange. However, since the crew seem to be shooting for realism surely the more jarring and disturbing thing they could have done would have been to leave the soundtrack empty, forcing the audience to watch and connect with the images undisturbed by what is being put into their ears. Silence is, as someone once said, golden.Last House on the Left is a film full of irritating elements like this that split my mind in two, leaving me half impressed and half depressed by what Craven is forcing us to sit through. The rape scenes, which fall into the mid-section of the film, have caused me the most bother. Not because they disturbed me in any psychological way -- there was never enough connection established with the characters to warrant tears of sympathy or rage -- but rather, disturbed at how frivolously Craven and the filmmakers were treating the notion of rape. In a more serious film I could have bought into this scenario, but in a work so knowingly exploitative as this it became crude and distasteful. Admittedly, there was more need to actually see the rape than there was in, say for example Peckinpah's Straw Dogs, in which the rape of Susan George was, to me, one of the most pointlessly misogynistic scenes ever committed to film. I had similar feelings about the latter scene involving oral-castration, something which should have left me reeling on the floor in agony just from the thought of it... left me completely cold. This is perhaps because much like the rest of the film it happens too fast to linger and is done so heavy-handedly that we half-expected it anyway. It seems that subtlety is another word Mr Craven is unfamiliar with.The climax of the film looks like a dry run for A Nightmare on Elm Street, with booby-trapped houses, chainsaws and knife attacks. All wrapped up with a jolly credit sequence which wouldn't have looked out of place on 60's British sitcom. This is juvenile, puerile and completely irresponsible filmmaking, which is now talked about alongside A Short film about Killing, as if The Last House on the Left is some kind of serious indictment against sexual violence. Well... it isn't. Any film that begins with a teenage girl soaping up her breasts in the shower holds a somewhat dubious notion of what constitutes as female empowerment. The only saving grace of this film is Fred. Lincoln, once actor, now porn-director, and the only member of the cast to write this film off as the turkey it most certainly is. Lincoln gives an amazingly mannered performance as Weasel, the older member of the group, and watching this I couldn't help but wonder why his career never took off. He has the charisma and screen presence to carry a film, but instead he's wasted in stuff like this. Last House on the Left is not a classic, its not essential viewing, it isn't scary and it's definitely not disturbing. Here is a cheap exploitation film that fails on all levels. Not even cinema extremist Mark Kermode could confess to liking this embarrassment. ...I haven't even mentioned the two bumbling police officers that pop up throughout the film to supply comic relief, or the fact that this travesty is a re-make of Bergman's classic The Virgin Spring. Common knowledge will attest that this film spent 30 years hidden away in the vault's of the BBFC. All I can say is... they should have left it there. 1/5</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Classic Horror?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Granted this was shot in the 70s (?) and was one of Craven's first films so it won't be up to par on a number of levels with later films . . . why is this a classic? This is TCM all over again (or TCM is a repeat of this--I don't care enough to look up who came first). This is one of the few films where I stopped it midway and said, `No power on earth can make me watch the rest of this.' Wow, and I thought Friday the 13th had bad execution. The only thing that scares me about this film is people quote it as being an exceptional film. Are we, as a society, too locked into the notion that whatever came in yesteryear is superior to what is being made today? That sequels can't live up to originals and that talent dies with age instead of getting better? First, foremost, and most offensively - the characters are retarded. I don't care how graphic a death anyone has, not one character is really worth caring about. Law enforcement who are supposed to provide comic relief - Police Squad from the Naked Gun films had more going for them than these guys, most notably Naked Guns police force was funny . . . probably because that was comedy. This is HORROR. At this point in his career, Craven demonstrated no ability to incorporate humor and horror together. The jumps between the two were so clunky and forced, it made me sick. Showed little promise with action scenes, and the only spark of hope came with the heroine's demise. Craven managed to give the scene some sense of sorrow and make me have a few remote second thoughts about that character's worth. Even that, scene though, was pretty mediocre, and even if it was spectacular one 45 second event cannot save an entire film. I really don't feel I'm being unfair by commenting without seeing the last chapter of Last House on the Left. I didn't buy the build up, I won't buy the finale, and therefore won't miss anything. Nothing that resembled the greatness of the first Nightmare on Elm Street can be seen in this film, and had I not known already I would never be able to tell the same man directed both movies. I'm still baffled as to how such undeserving films become cult classics.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing for it's time, remains so today.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember renting this film years ago (1998) with Nightmare/Elm ST. 3. The movie, back then, was really just to waste the weekend for me. I never really got into it. Then I bought a used rental copy 2 years later, and after viewing it told myself that I would NEVER watch this movie again. I lied to myself. Buying the uncut (More 'bout this later) movie just days ago, I felt like most others do after watching it...sick. This movie is not pleasent. The two girls that played the parts were amazing with what they had to do. Last House is a lot to stomach, and both Wes and Sean do great with building sympathy for the girls. No film has ever been done like this up to that point. The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre still had 2 years before they were viewed. Now, to call this film uncut is just not true.the original film ran 91 minutes, and the latest edition runs at 84. The other 7 minutes were sliced by the projectionists at the drive-thrus. Although these 7 minutes are gone, and for people who would like to see the truly complete film, are out of luck. Part of me is curious about what lied in those 7 minutes. The other part is glad they were cut. 84 minutes is enough to get the point out there. Anyways, this film is truly disturbing and should only be viewed by mature adults. Basically Last House is too real for me, and it makes me aware of the problems that we are facing with nowadays, and to think it's gotten worse in 30 years really gets me concerned with where society is heading. For being an eye-opener for that generation, and truly powerful, it's gets a 10. For being watchable, 2. Remember, however many times you watch this film, the first 45 minutes will forever make you sick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Masterpiece of Non-supernatural Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's unfairly maligned masterpiece of non-supernatural horror is as disturbing and gut-wrenching today as it was thirty years ago. Instead of picketing theaters and banning the video, parents should have been making their teenage daughters watch this movie--they would never try and score pot or stay out late again! The gritty, documentary feel of the movie adds to the tension, and the likability of the characters makes us empathize with them more than the usual exploitation trash. Even the killers are given three-dimensional, intriguing personalities, which makes their acts far more unsettling. Jason and Michael Myers are basically killing machines, with no conscience to temper them or motive to drive them. Krug &amp; his gang of outcasts are thrill-seeking thugs, who resort to violence almost without realizing they're doing it, and suffer faint pangs of regret when the carnage is over.One of the most revealing sequences in the movie is the rape of the virginal character Mari. Krug undoes her belt and yanks her pants down, as the camera focuses voyeuristically on her pelvis. As soon as her bare legs and underpants are revealed, we cut away to Junior, watching helplessly. We then cut to side view of Mari and Krug from the waist down. We can see that Mari still has her shirt on. The sequence then cuts to a close-up of Mari and Krug's faces, Mari staring emotionlessly into space and Krug huffing like an animal. Why do I find this particular sequence so important? Because it reveals this movie for what it truly is: a psychological character study. In a lesser exploitation movie, the threesome would have ripped off all of Mari's clothes, and she would have cried and carried on as Krug had his way with her. The fact that Krug doesn't bother removing her shirt signifies that he wants to do this quickly, it's the obvious next step. Mari's submissive expression is far more disturbing than relentless screaming would have been, because we can actually see all the hope and desire to escape drain from her face. Afterwards, Krug gets up, Mari walks off and vomits. Krug looks away, ashamed, as do the others. It's as though they suddenly realize that their two minute thrill is a devastating and life-altering event for Mari. When Krug shoots her down, it almost feels like an act of mercy.After these emotionally shattering moments, the bloodbath at the film's finale is a most welcome catharsis!Perhaps the ultimate horror movie tackling the human race's infinite potential for violence and depravity, LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is an intelligent, underrated and misjudged classic.</fullReview>

The few comic moments provide an all too brief respite from the relentless terror of the film. I know lots of people seem to hate this film, and I can understand why. It is not easy to take. There are plenty of things wrong with the movie: the low budget, the subpar acting, bad editing, etc. But I still find it shocking and effective. When I was a teenager, the local video store carried the film, but it was located with all the other cheesy horror films, so i never rented it. Plus the fact that my mom watched the movies with me. I am glad I didn't see it until I was about 27 years old. I certainly couldn't have handled it when I was younger.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disturbing And Influential Cult Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LHOTL is based loosely on Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring and to this day, although dated, still remains a very accomplished, disturbing and influential piece of film making. Craven's debut is undoubtedly a product of a 1970's middle-America weaned on violence in the Vietnam War era. Here he cleverly goes no-holds-barred to shock a society where violent individuals are still rife. He employs this through the introduction of one of his pet themes, the deconstruction of the nuclear family and here the conflict arises through two opposing families going head-to-head. The decent family, a symbol of white-Christian American society, turns to their primitive side to overcome the make-shift psychotic familiar (an early 70's horror theme also explored two years later in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre). Shot on grainy 16mm it is a dark, disturbing affair with scenes of violence, torture and rape that could be considered taboo! (That is in the uncut version, still banned in Britain since 1984 not the recent butchered version). But it is decently handled, capturing the fear, paranoia and important themes of the time. David Hess is so chilling as lead psycho Krug that he would inevitably become type cast in later films like Hitch-Hike and House on the Edge of the Park, but as for his music score, lets just say it doesn't fit in!8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~Last House on the Left is by no means a great film. The comic relief scenes (featuring Martin Kove) are idiotic and the happy music (sung by star Hess) accompanied by serious violence is unnerving. Despite these opinions, I respect this movie. There is a stark realism about it. An early effort from horror legends Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham, Last House makes people feel uncomfortable. It has unsettling moments heightened by the fact that this could happen to anyone. It's all very real and scary. The flick turns your stomach, but at the same time, you can't quit watching it. David Hess is brilliant in the role of Krug, the villainous gang leader. From Hess' expressions, you would think he's really capable of what his characters does. After Krug and company rape and kill the girls, there is a very awkward scene that follows. They seem to share a moment. These guys are hardened killers, but they are affected by their actions. There is a message buried here I think. This film does not glorify violence at all. When you watch Reservoir Dogs, you want to be a Reservoir Dog (at least I do). On the other hand, when you watch Last House, you cannot identify with these killers and you are disgusted by their actions. It is disturbing and it's not your typical horror film. Never forget, "it's only a movie...it's only a movie."Note for genre buffs: This was Steve Miner's (director of House and Warlock) first film experience along with Craven and Cunningham, who would separately go on to create the genre's biggest names: Jason Voorhees and Freddy Krueger.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading the recent reviews of this movie by people who've probablynever seen it until it came out on DVD, I can't help thinking just onething: this world truly is full of IGNORANT people! First off, to thosewho complain the film is too grainy - try thinking about when it wasmade and the shoestring budget it was made for. To those who complainabout the acting - think about the screenplay and the raw unnervingnessof it all. To those who complain about the music - give Wes a break, itwas only his first film! To those who just plain think this is a badmovie - you're entitled to your opinion, but I don't feel you've giventhe film half a chance, nor considered the extremeness of the situationsinvolved. This film is about the dangers of being a teenager: drugs,peer pressure, attempting to be "with it" and to fit in; there is alsothe ever-present underlying theme of watching out for strangers. It isalso about the feelings a parent would have when they find out somethingterrible has happened to their child and her friend. Think about it - ifyour child had been brutally raped, humiliated, beaten and murdered andyou had the chance to exact revenge on those who did it, how would youfeel? Probably like Mari Collingwood's parents. This film is to bepraised for its messages of being wary of one's surroundings. There arevery real dangers in this world - don't just write them off becauseyou'd rather not see some of these dangers depicted on film. I pity thepeople who took this film at face value as pointless violence and gore.10 out of 10...........</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inept, yet disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is a movie that's legendary for being disturbing, and in another camp legendary for being awful. I think it's both. The screenplay &amp; direction by first-timer Wes Craven are very amateurish, and the comedy scenes are cringeworthy. A lot of the acting is poor, and the movie has an awkward structure and pace, as well as many huge credibility problems where the story depends on massive coincidences.And yet, it's one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen, and manages to push its anti-violence message with amazing force. David Hess is excellent as the sadistic Krug, and although Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham are laughable in the early scenes, when the movie actually gets going their performances improve dramatically so that you can almost physically feel their terror.Although Craven has made a number of better written, directed and acted movies with much higher production values, I don't think he's equaled the impact of this shoddy, squalid little film. It's art, of a sort.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I saw this film years ago, when i lent a pirated copy off a friend of a friend. The quality of it was almost non exsistent, but the film struck a nerve with me. It was the most uncomfortable 90 minutes of my life.If you can get past the dodgy acting, and the ridiculous soundtrack, you find a horror film that could actually happen. The bad guys are not invincible, Unlike Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees, these people are flesh and blood, but they are evil. They have no particular problem with the two girls, and just do what they do for a cheap laugh.This film has been unfairly put into the exploitation category. It is not. It is a hard hitting crime film, which rightly carries a warning on the box. If you are easily offended don't watch it as the rape scenes are very disturbing, and when Mari is finally killed she just walks towards the lake with nowhere to go. It is very disturbing to watch as Mari seems to think, you're not going to torture me anymore, I either swim away or you shoot me and end my suffering.Do not compare this film to I Spit on your grave, which is just abysmal and pointless. It is an unearthed Jewell, while not everybody's taste, is a very good film.If you are interested in this, it has been announced it will be re-released in England very soon, although it will be heavilly cut, so I recommend you do what I did and get a copy from America (Sorry Mr Customs Man).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a nice experience ... but art isn't always nice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard a lot about this film before I saw it being a fan of horror, and also a film student who had spent significant time studying horror films. In Australia 'Last House on the Left' is not available - it was banned on release and this ban has never (to my knowledge) been lifted, so I obtained it though a mail-order pirate (sorry to Wes Craven for missing out on the royalties ... but you can blame the Australian censor for that). It is not a nice film to watch. It is violent, cruel and relentless - but it is important. I recently saw 'American Nightmare', a documentary on American horror in the 60s and 70s and Wes Craven spoke about his feelings when he made 'Last House on the Left'. He said that when it was made he was a very angry young man. Scenes from the film were spliced together with a montage of scenes from the Vietnam war, the shooting of students at Penn State, the burning of blacks in the South of the US, and other horrific scenes. Wes' anger at the society that he was living in, manifested itself into a violent and cruel film where two teenagers, who are going to see a rock band and trying to score pot (hippies?) are killed by a gang of psychotics. A simple metaphor is that of the violent death of the sixties flower children ... and a death to innocence. The second part of the film where we see average people, do violent things, is perhaps not so unlike taking an average American kid and sending him off to slaughter a bunch of Vietnamese. There really are countless metaphors in this film especially within the context of its time. I don't recommend it for the faint hearted ... I also don't recommend it for people who like violence for violence's sake. The violence has got to be seen for what it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What was all the fuss about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got hold of an uncut copy of Wes Craven's controversial video nasty LHOTL. I must say I was very disappointed. I had the sick bucket and the psychiatrist ready but, luckily, I didn't need them. I might give a few things away so if you haven't seen the film skip this review.It is clearly evident that Craven was still learning his craft when this film was made. Firstly, I didn't care about the girls. Anyone who runs away from dangerous serial killers at one mile an hour deserves to be caught. David Hess' performance as the gang-leader Krug is brutal but limited (towards the end of the film it becomes clear that he is only capable of one expression). The bumbling cops are supposed to provide some comic relief. But they are about as funny as the Police Academy movies. When they are on the screen, subconsciously we want to get back to killings. The killers, who recently escaped from prison, were mentioned on the radio. Are we really supposed to believe that only two officers would show up at the scene? When the gang conveniently show up at the house of one of their victims, it is ridiculous to think that the parents, who are worrying about their missing daughter, would invite them in to stay. When the parents find out what happened they are about as emotional as Arnold Schwarzenegger.However, the film isn't all bad. There are a few promising moments. Craven experiments with dream sequences (Nightmare on Elm Street anyone?). The murders in the woods are powerful simply because they are shot in such a cold, flat syle. But Craven spoils this intensity with a light-hearted hillbilly soundtrack. The end credits show the actors smiling happily, reminding us that it is only a movie, and reducing the impact of it's powerful punch. Last House On The Left fails to live up to it's notorious reputation. If you want to be scared watch THE TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE. If you want an ironic tale of twisting fate watch Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING, the film that Craven's debut was based on. The film is worth seeing simply because it contains one of the most realistic murder scenes ever put to celluloid. Ahead of it's time, but pretty tame by todays standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House on the Left, The (1972) *** (out of 4) Craven's notorious shocker is a remake of Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin Spring and deals with two teenage girls going to the city for a concert but being kidnapped by four crazed criminals. The girls and raped, tortured and eventually murdered but the killer's end up spending the night at one of the girl's houses where the tables are turned. I've seen this film countless times in my life and it always disturbed me to the point where I hated the movie with a passion. I always felt the movie was rather poorly made and in the end it was nothing but an exploitation show meant to disturb you. I still feel that way but I've actually doubled my normal star rating because the film actually worked with me this time. My stomach was still being turned and I was disgusted in its vile nature but I reckon that was the whole point. There's still a lot that I don't like about the film including the stupid comedy relief from the two idiot cops. Why Craven decided to throw this slapstick in is beyond me because it really feels out of place especially when it pops up after watching two teens get brutally murdered. Another issue is that the film looks incredibly cheap (it was a low budget) and amateurish but this adds some to its atmosphere and makes the film seem all the more real. The now legendary tagline that "it's only a movie" is something to really keep in mind as the film comes off very realistic as if you're watching a documentary. The performances are all rather mixed but they all suit the film fine and that includes David Hess as the leader of the gang and Marc Sheffler as his heroin addicted son. The dialogue in the film, especially the opening ten minutes, is downright awful but there's still no denying that this is a highly disturbing film that manages to be vile, disgusting and just downright evil.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Craven's Disturbing Debut Is Still His Greatest Achievement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's debut as a director, "The Last House On The Left" is an innovative, deeply disturbing, and overall vastly underrated film that I personally still consider this director's most original and important work up to date. The movie is, of course, unpleasant to watch at times, but the fact that it accomplishes to disturb (and often sadden) so deeply, the fact that it illustrates the sadism, brutality an insanity so realistically, is what makes "The Last House On The Left" special and, at times, brilliant.- SPOILERS! - Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) wants to celebrate her 17th birthday by going to a Rock concert with her friend Lucy. When looking for marijuana in the city before the concert, the two girls are forced into a house by a gang of low-life criminals, three men and one woman, lead by the sadistic psychopath Krug Stillo (David Hess). The girls are subsequently kidnapped to the woods, humiliated, raped and brutally murdered in some deeply disturbing, and saddening scenes. A while later the murderers seek shelter in the house of Mari's worried parents (Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr). When the Collingwoods find out who their guests really are, they are immediately determined to take revenge. Bloody, merciless revenge...At the point where the girls are murdered one is (or at least I was) so saddened and angry that the parents' bloody revenge comes like a relief. But although the parents' revenge is more than justified, the film is not necessarily promoting vigilantism, en contraire, it makes every effort to show brutal acts of violence as the disturbing acts they are.Some of the performances in "The Last House On The Left" are outstanding. Especially David Hess plays his role of Psychopath-par-excellence Krug Stillo with utmost perfection. Stillo is a character so brutal and abhorrent that even his fellow murderers are afraid of him. In one of the movie's most impressive scenes, Krug orders one of his accomplices, more precisely his own son (played by Marc Sheffler) to "...blow your f****** brains out!", at which point his terrified son shoots himself in the head. Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham also deliver excellent performances as the two young victims, especially Cassel shows fear and terror in a most convincing way. The parents, Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr, deliver great performances, as their despair, rage and desire for revenge is depicted in a very realistic manner.Apart from a few minor flaws, such as the "funny" scene about two dumb and extremely incompetent cops, which temporarily decreases the movie's seriousness, "The Last House On The Left" is a deeply disturbing and very original experience. Some people might fail to see that the fact that a movie is unpleasant to watch, does not make the movie bad. And this film is certainly not for people who are easily offended or sensitive when it comes to violence. It is beyond doubt, however, that "The Last House On The Left" is original as it is disturbing, and certainly not the everyday thriller people are used to. This may not be everybody's taste, but it is unique and uncompromising cinema that a true cineaste can not afford to miss! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>****1/2 out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is among a rare breed of cult classic horror films along with Night of the Living Dead, which are so effective in part because they stood inside of themselves and looked out. They saw us as we were seeing them. That's where the horror lies, people were so fascinated and sickened by these films because they were essentially watching themselves, or at least the bleak social realism of the world they lived in.Night of the Living Dead was so powerful because it was filmed the very same year that American troops entered the Vietnamese village of My Lai and destroyed everything in site, thus the horror was shifted. Suddenly that limp American flag hanging in the cemetery of the opening scene was much scarier than then walking dead that surrounded it. Similarly Last House on the Left defines true evil during a time when teenagers practiced peace and love. "I thought you're supped to be the love generation" the main character's mother says after hearing that her daughter is going to a Bloodlust concert. If she only knew how deceiving surfaces can be.The story is simple. After the concert, two rebellious teenage girls go looking to score some grass. They stumble upon Junior who is the junkie son of Krug, an escaped murderer who is hiding out with another escapee and his girl. Junior, promising the girls a sweet deal, lures them back to the filthy apartment where the convicts are hiding. During this sequence Wes Craven (who wrote, directed and edited) cuts between this sad space and back to one of the girl's home in which her parents, in their conservative, bourgeois living space, set up for their daughter's birthday. Upon arrival the girls are mocked, abused, harassed and tortured. They are then rounded up in the morning and driven into a remote country area where the criminals' car breaks down and the sexual and physical torture of these girls continues in the nearby woods until both are murdered.Then something ironic happens which leads to a brilliant scene of terror. Not knowing their surroundings, the killers clean themselves, change their clothes and head to the nearest house where they can spend the night until getting their car fixed in the morning. Turns out the house belongs to the parents of one of the girls they killed, who, after discovering what these people did to their daughter, exact their revenge. Last House on the Left explores depravity in a way that Craven would never return to over the course of his highly successful career. Maybe that's for the better. The film has a rawness that is unparalleled even to this day. We have come to a point in time where horror films are all gloss, where violence exists more as a special effect than a product of evil. Here is one that exists at ground level and unflinchingly shows us acts of violence and torture as if we are a very part of the process. Last House on the Left is so penetrating in part because it takes responsibility for the evil that it shows us. It is sickened by the state of American depravity that existed underneath its surface image of peace and love. This is a contrast that Craven makes in the mentioned scene, between the normal American household and the criminal underbelly. The truth is that evil can penetrate any space, even the bourgeois household, which is why the parents take their revenge, not as part of a horror movie climax, but because evil is not defined by surfaces, it can lurk just below even the most conservative looking of spaces. Now that's a scary thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very different film from the rest of Craven's oeuvre- Virgin Spring suffused with nihilism inspired by Vietnam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would probably guess that The Last House on the Left, like Night of the Living Dead or even Texas Chainsaw Massacre to an extent, is as much a 'horror' movie as it is a reaction to the Vietnam war. It's a film that goes to lengths to push the envelope to the point where you almost have to think about why there's an envelope to start with. Maybe Wes Craven has directed other movies I've yet to see that are as bloody as this, but the sheer pitiless, gut-wrenching nature of the picture is one that is very hard to take. That it leaves such an indelible impression that I can still recall the murder scenes midway through the movie, done in such a way that it shows violence as being as sickening and despicable a thing as it can be, is undeniable. That it also has the production values of a student film is also hard to ignore. This is a work by a filmmaker with more ambition than he can really grasp onto for such a cheapie exploitation flick.The basic story is borrowed, more or less (probably less due to it just being the broad elements), from Bergman's the Virgin Spring, which by and large dealt with similarly tragic and consequential ideas with humility, patience and with, needless to say, far greater actors. It's about two girls who go into the forest, get picked up by some sicko criminal types, get raped and mutilated and killed in a drawn out fashion. Then the killers, oddly enough, wind up at the house that the girl's parents live at, soon to meet a very sordid and fatalistic ending. None of the film is 'easy', which does give it a lasting power. This is a film that conjures up, more than anything, what it must be like to be in such a horrific situation. It's almost like if a documentary film student were filming the out-takes of a slasher movie. So the intentions behind it, and how the actors in much of the first part of the film, try to give themselves to the material, is staggering and kind of amazing. If Craven's point is to squeeze tighter the politically correct noose and try to connect with people during a bloody war of its own period, the point is made at least on a visceral level during these scenes.The big problem then, at least for me, is that Craven still hasn't found himself really altogether as a filmmaker. And he also isn't totally sure what kind of film he's making. Is it a satirical statement on violence and its social effect like Clockwork Orange, a pure exploitation-style horror movie with exaggerated characters without much dimension, or a documentary-style tome on the loss of faith? Unlike Bergman's film, which really held together the idea of the story being more like a fable than anything, Craven's The Last House on the Left is a kind of jumbled up lot of the above elements. But, in a way, sometimes you almost wish the filmmaker wouldn't get in the way or little aspects, such as placing such f***ed up sound effects during the scenes of violence or the somber, melodramatic music. Any satirical elements aren't really developed well in the script, as the 'comedy' of sorts is very base and near puerile. And the actors, with maybe one or two exceptions, seem too amateurish to pull off the material. After a while it becomes more of an exercise in repulsion than anything very redeemable cinematically (and I say this as someone who's hard to really shock or offend with horror films, unless they commit a crime of being boring or pretentious- something this film comes close enough to doing).So, in the end, I felt mixed on The Last House on the Left. It's a film with trying for something to say, or at least seems that way, and it's got the gusto to try and rise to a more intellectual level. But it also is- and Craven himself has stated this- a flick for the grind-house circuits, where people may be ready for shockable material, but not for a mush-mash of dialog that usually doesn't work as well as the actors think it does and performances that even by low-budget standards of 1972 are weak. In the end I wanted to laugh at the film, like any other bad horror movie, but ended up cringing more often than not (and not in the way the filmmakers might have intended).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie you wont forget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had to describe this movie in one word it would be "Disturbing". THIS IS NOT A "FEEL GOOD" MOVIE.I saw it when it came out in theatre's with my mother and sister. I was nine and my sister was fourteen. I suspect my mother was hoping to instill a healthy caution of strangers in us by teaching us what evil some people are capable of. If so, it worked.It's a unique movie (especially for it's day) in that the story takes you step by sickening step from the abduction of a minor(s) for sexual pleasures through murdering the victim(s). The graphics were every bit as telling as the story line was.Unfortunateley it's not a unique subject in reality but hearing these stories on the news when they happen don't reveal the horrer some of the victims endure whereas the movie brings you as close to the victims perspective as you'd care to get, maybe closer. The movie does deal some payback to the "Bad Guys" towards the end but hardly enough to make you get up and cheer after what you've seen to that point.I think it's a bit over the top as a life lesson for a child because while it would persuade a child to excersize caution, it also gives you a general bad feeling about people and what life could deal to anyone at random.One thing's for certain, you'll never forget it. For good or bad it leaves quite the lasting impression.I've never heard mention of it as playing on T.V., cable or otherwise. I thought maybe it was banned from the U.S. for it's intense content but I find no mention of that on the internet. I wonder why it fell into obscurity like it did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972)directed by: Wes Cravenstarring: David Hess, Sandra Cassel, Lucy Grantham, and Marc Shefflerplot: Mari (Sandra Cassel) goes to the big city with her fun friend Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) to see a Bloodlust concert and score some good grass. Instead, they are abducted by Krug (David Hess) and his gang of brutal rapist/murderers. The gang takes them, drugged and tied up, to the woods which is ironically just across the street from Mari's house. After putting the girls through hell, the brutal gang takes refuge in Mari's house, and when her parents discover the brutal crime they have committed, they set up the perfect revenge plot!my thoughts: I am a fan of Wes Craven. He either makes his films nice and scary (A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, SCREAM), or just plain fun (SUMMER OF FEAR, CURSED). I have always wanted to see his two earlier films (this and THE HILLS HAVE EYES). I was not disappointed. The acting is great. I bought Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham as innocent fun loving teenagers; I bought David Hess, Fred J. Lincoln, and Jeramie Rain as brutal rapists and murders; and I bought Marc Sheffler as the conflicted, druggie son of the lead rapist. Although, I did think Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr could have done better as the caring parents turned into savage murderers. And the subplot with the dumb police was very pointless, it was only funny in the scene with Ada Washington.The deaths are also brutal. This gang of scums put these two girls through absolute hell, and then the parents put the gang through absolute hell. I almost had trouble sitting through the torture of Mari and Phyllis, but when the gang gets what they deserve, I think it was very poetic.Other high points are the atmosphere (I love horror movies taking place in the woods) and the music by David Hess ("The Road Leads to Nowhere" is the shizit).Definitely check this out if you are a Wes Craven fan. It's interesting to see how he started out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House On The Left is Wes Cravens feature length directorial debut, and he did a good job as far as making a campy, low-budget slasher film. The film is about two teenagers looking for dope one night before a concert, and lets just say they end up in the wrong hands, and all hell breaks loose. Whats good about this film is that the plot isn't too heavy, but it seems like it gets you involved in the picture. You actually feel bad for the two girls, and you want to get the bad guys killed. I also think that the parents and police officers are portrayed as bumbling fools throughout most of the film anyway. Warning: The film contains a few sequences of strong bloody violence, and a rape scene. Unrated, and not for the squeamish.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't review exploitation movies. But when a movie like The Last House on the Left leaves you wondering if there's still any hope in humanity, then you have to read through its lines, bear its unbelievable dehumanization, and thank God that the second half of the movie is less than average, consisting of only cheap scenes of gore and violence. The first half however, especially at its end, is one of the most disturbing, depressing, and melancholic scenes in film history. Prepare yourself. And if you don't have a strong stomach to handle not only the gore but also the animalistic rape and torture of the two girls, Mari (Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham), do yourself a favor and go watch Scream.Mari is a young girl, full of life. She has a friend, Phyllis, whom she admires and like your typical best of friends, they like to have a little fun, a little adventure perhaps. They want to get a "fix", and unfortunately for them they get trapped and kidnapped by a group of murderers and rapists, two men and a woman. They let them lose in the forest, and from then on, they torture them, humiliate them, and erode their dignity, until they meet their ultimate fate. Ironically, the criminals take shelter in Mari's apartment.Not to spoil anything, but what's left to spoil? Wes Craven's graphic film is only for those who want to know what it's like to strip any entertainment value from a movie. This film scratches the surface of the Vietnam War, and inspired many directors. A word of advice: This is not entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Of All The Old Exploitation Flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last House On The Left began when Sean Cunningham, a man with connections, got an offer from a foreign movie theatre that wanted him to produce a low budget horror film for them. The theatre had just bought another horror film from America, so they wanted Cunningham to make them a movie that they could play with the other horror film as a double feature. Cunningham decided that instead of writing and directing the film himself, he would give the job to Wes Craven, a man that he knew that wanted to make movies.Craven and Cunningham got together and decided that if they wanted to make a movie that would sell then they needed to make a movie that was so shocking and intense that it would draw attention everywhere. So, Craven got started on the script, and within three days he had written a script, which would later be made into one of the most popular exploitation flicks to ever hit the big screen.Last House On The Left begins with two young girls named Mary and Phyllis, who, on Mari's 17th birthday, go to a concert. Along the way, they try to score some marijuana, and end up in presence of a band of psychopathic serial killers, two of which have just broken out of prison. The band of killers kidnap the girls, and do something to them that is so brutal that I can't even mention it in this review. Later on, the killers need a place to hide out, so they disguise themselves as regular, every day people and stop in at the home of Mari's parents, to ask if they can stay the night there. The parents allow the killers to stay in their home, but later find out exactly what these psychopaths did to their daughter. Now, the parents seek revenge, and the ultimate battle between good and evil breaks loose.First of all, The Last House On The Left is not a pleasant movie at all. It is violent, brutal, shocking, and takes it pretty far. Even the people who love this movie can only watch it on occasion. When watching Last House, you have to be prepared to see a film that will sadden you, shock you, and possibly offend you.The villains in this movie, as much as most of us will grow to hate them, really are great. They are so crazy and brutal and fit the tone of the film perfectly. We have Krug, a person that is so evil that you will want to kill him, but such a bad *** that you would wish that you had him on your side during a fight. Then, there is his partner in crime Weasel, whose name matches his personality perfectly. Then there is Sadie, Krug's girl who is almost as brutal as he is. Finally, there is Junior, Krug's good-hearted son that Krug has hooked on heroin in order to control the boys mind.All of the actors and actresses in this movie are great, way better then what I am use to seeing in films that are as low budget as this. In my opinion, David Hess is one of the most under rated actors ever. The suspense in this movie is enough to kill you, and while this movie isn't extremely gory, the violence factor in this movie is a guaranteed shocker.Exploitation fans will love it, some non-exploitation fans will enjoy it, most non-exploitation fans will hate it.Remember, to avoid fainting, keep repeating... It's only a movie.... Only a movie... Only a movie.... Only a movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated Product Strongly Shows The Roots Of Terror..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that this movie is a lot scarier to people over 30. Thats not saying it can't scare or disturb younger viewers, just that they have so much more to material to judge against. I'm 31, and I have just seen TLHOTL for the first time. Now, I can't say that it was bad, but I can say that it was different than I expected. It's not a horror movie, it's a terror movie. The soundtrack is dated, the film quality is weak, the acting is pretty corny. However, this is a low-budget affair, and at times the acting is fantastic, and the soundtrack does a lot to develop atmosphere, and also show contrast. Watching this movie, you can so see where where others in the terror genealogy come from from and fit in. You can definitely see shades of "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and "Friday The 13th" in this movie, and on those accounts alone it deserves respect. I have not seen "I Spit On Your Grave", or "The House at The Edge of The Park", or "The Hills Have Eyes"(part 1), and would love to see them just to see where they fit in , in the scheme of things so to speak. I read or heard that Craven and Cunningham were told to gun for something that could rival and be "exploited", like Romero's "Night of the Living Dead". Well, what they did was much more. They opened the door to movies where "normal" humans were the monsters, not zombies(Which are my favorite), or space creatures, or humans controlled by supernatural or extraordinary means. No matter how critical one can be about the production of TLHOTL, it is definitely a classic if even based on that fact alone.Now I know that some people will say that there were other foreign films that were predecessors and blah blah blah. Let me ask you, how available were they in 1972? Are you only even able to ask that question because this is 2005? Exactly. All this leads back to this being scarier and more disturbing for older viewers. J-Horror, Internet Porn, changes in social norms have rendered some of the themes in the movies, not so brazen and bizarre in present times. A movie like "Audition"("Odishon"-J) has a much more disturbing type of violence, not to mention isolation. Which, as my next point, is something done better by G.A. Romero, and especially John Carpenter(who can create a sense of isolation in the middle of a major city). And we have easier access to all types of films and media from all different types of places in general. That all being said,l TLHOTL is still a grass roots classic of this style of cinema which has impact and influence thirty years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"How would you like me to put my boot up your a*s, sideways?" Notorious exploitation film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last House on the Left begins by informing us that the events in the film are actually based on reality. It is broadcast on the news that Krug Stillo (David Hess) has escaped from prison with the help of his illegitimate heroin addicted son Junior (Marc Sheffler), his friend Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred Lincoln) &amp; his girlfriend Sadie (Jeramie Rain). They are described as murderers, dope pushers &amp; rapists &amp; that they are probably hiding out somewhere in New York. Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is celebrating her 17th birthday with her friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham) when they encounter Junior whom they try to buy some grass from, Junior takes them back to a motel room where Krug, Weasel &amp; Sadie lie in wait to kidnap the two teenagers. The next morning Mari &amp; Phyllis are shoved in Krug's car boot as he &amp; his accomplice's decide to drive to Canada. By now Mari's parents John (Gaylord St. James) &amp; Estelle (Cynthia Carr) are worried enough to call the local Sheriff (Marshall Anker) &amp; his Deputy (Martin Kove). On their way Krug &amp; co. break down in a wooded area ironically mere yards from Mari's house where they take both girls deep into the woods to have some sick, twisted &amp; perverted fun with them...Edited, written &amp; directed by Wes Craven The Last House on the Left is undeniably a powerful film but I found it somewhat unpleasant to watch. The script is about evil people doing evil things to good people, these evil characters are total scum who have no remorse &amp; no feelings while the good characters are homely upstanding members of the community who in the end sink to the same level as Krug &amp; his gang. Maybe The Last House on the Left's moral message is the means justify the ends. For some reason Craven decided to include two comedy relief police officers who feel very out of place &amp; inappropriate. The nastiness in The Last House on the Left isn't overly graphic but is quite shocking, they make Phyliss pee herself &amp; pull her intestines out while they cut Mari with a knife &amp; then shoot her. The parents revenge scenes aren't that graphic either apart from a slit throat &amp; a silly castration. Technically The Last House on the Left is very basic &amp; was obviously shot on a hand held camera, it has a simplistic bleak almost documentary like atmosphere &amp; feel to it. I hated the music, credited to star David Hess which just got on my nerves &amp; seemed out of place at times. The acting is variable, the two girls do very well &amp; Hess &amp; his gang do a good job of making you hate them while Mari's parents are terrible. I thought The Last House on the Left was a pretty good exploitation film that moved along at a fair pace &amp; is certainly a powerful film but at the same time I found it all rather bleak, a bit depressing &amp; I don't really enjoy watching teenage girls being humiliated &amp; brutally murdered. Maybe not a film for the casual viewer but exploitation &amp; horror fans should try &amp; watch it as I'm sure most of them will get something out of it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No longer cutting edge, but it still has an impact</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When LAST HOUSE first came out, back in 1972, it had people vomiting and fainting in the aisles. Now, a little over thirty years later, it has people asking why it still warrants our attention, when there are more slasher/splatter movies on a video rental store's shelves than there are cockroaches in a big-city apartment building. Hey, there's even been a major motion picture with a disemboweling -- HANNIBAL.Part of the answer is historical. LAST HOUSE is the first significant achievement by Wes Craven, who has gone on to become a major figure in both film and television. It may also be that if it weren't for LAST HOUSE, there would be NO slasher/splatter movies on any video rental store's shelves, because LAST HOUSE was the movie that created the genre. Film scholars should also note that LAST HOUSE was based on the same 14th-century Swedish folktale as THE VIRGIN SPRING, and contains various allusions to the Bergman film. But it isn't just horror movie historians who believe LAST HOUSE still deserves public and critical attention. Many people, including yours truly, feel that even though it's no longer cutting edge, it still retains its original impact. Several good arguments have already been made, which I'll present along with my own.The most widely voiced argument seems to be that while other films have equaled or surpassed LAST HOUSE in the amount and explicitness of their violence, they don't measure up in credibility. This credibility comes partly from the context in which the violence occurs, and partly from the film's look and feel.Regarding context, any violent act is less disturbing if it either (a) seems totally removed from any life experience you can imagine getting into, and/or (b) happens to someone you can't see as a real person. Such is the case with so many movies that present contrived situations and victims who are little more than shooting gallery ducks.Such is not the case, however with LAST HOUSE. The two adolescent girls, Mari and Phyllis, could be people you went to school with, and their humiliation, torture, rape, murder, and mutilation is the end result of a mistake that's easy to imagine making -- letting your guard down because you were having fun and the excitement of the moment made you careless and overconfident. In this case, Mari and Phyllis are off to a rock concert to celebrate Mari's 16th birthday and want to score some weed. Unfortunately, they go off with the wrong guy and end up the captives of Krug Stillo, Fred `Weasel' Podowski, and Sadie -- three escaped convicts who have a very sadistic idea of fun. (The aforementioned wrong guy is Junior Stillo, Krug's illegitimate son, who is a reluctant participant.) When the girls try to resist and escape, the sadism degenerates into bestial rage. So much for the notion that if you stand up to the bullies, they'll back down.And here, I'd like to add one of my personal reasons for finding LAST HOUSE effective. Krug and Co. and the atrocities they committed against Mari and Phyllis seem all to believable to me because they remind me of several characters I had the misfortune to get mixed up with many years ago. The details wouldn't be germane to this review, but I think it's germane to say that there are probably many other folks who've been similarly -- if not quite so extremely -- victimized, and so can relate to the events in LAST HOUSE.Moving on to the look and feel issue, while we all appreciate the polished, slick look of a big-budget Hollywood film , that look makes it obvious you're watching a fabrication. But LAST HOUSE is a low-budget movie with with that grainy, washed-out low-budget look and slightly muffled low-budget sound. The filmmakers also deliberately used documentary-style shooting techniques, because their previous work had been largely in the area of documentary films. All of this combined creates the strong illusion that you're eavesdropping on real events.The second major argument concern the reaction of the killer to what they've done. Unlike Jason and other mindless killing machines, the killers are themselves shocked and horrified by their own acts, which forces the viewer to find those acts all the more shocking.Finally, I;d like to challenge one basic assumption made by those who claim LAST HOUSE no longer has any power -- that the ubiquity of graphic violence in the cinema must inevitably cause the general public to adopt a `So what else is new' attitude toward it. Granted, constant or repeated exposure to a particular stimulus tend to desensitize one to that stimulus. In fact, some groups of people, such as E.R. doctors, policemen, and social workers, MUST desensitize themselves to heinous and extreme acts of violence to do their jobs properly and stay sane. But we aren't all in those lines of work, and so don't all have to force or let ourselves ease to feel shock when something shocking happens. Even if you've seen every other slasher/splatter movie on your video rental store's shelves, you should still be able to get a shock from LAST HOUSE if your emotions are still alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't usually write too many comments on movies because I like to give them a few viewings beofre making up my mind but this movie needed to be commented on. I recently saw this movie and Shocker another of Wes Craven's movies and I'm really starting to feel that Craven had a fluke in Nightmare on Elm Street and the later Scream. Last House on the Left succeeds in seriously disturbing its viewer so in that respect I guess it's a good film but in general it is flat, with terrible build up to almost nothing at all and as a strong strong horror fan I was really dissapointed with the end result. If you must see it, see it as a film with a cult following not as a horror movie and be prepared for not disturbing but instead almost perverted rape scenes which seem more like a disturbed persons fantasy video instead of B movie camp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genuine classic to be studied</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS!!! Predating the flood of American horror films released in the wake of the Vietnam war, Wes Craven's phenomenal 1972 classic, The Last House on the Left is the amateur film that took horror to another, more terrifying level.Influencing the sadism of The Texas Chain Saw Massacre (Tobe Hooper, 1974),the inventiveness of The Evil Dead (Sam Raimi, 1982) and the documentary filming style of The Blaire Witch Project (Eduardo Sanchez &amp; Daniel Myrick, 1999), Craven's film is a powerful and raw experience, once seen, never forgotten.`All that blood and violence, I thought you were supposed to be the love generation!'Last House. was Wes Craven's film debut. It tells the story of Phyllis and Mary (played by Sandra Peabody and Lucy Grantham); two girls who, on their way to a rock concert, try to 'score some grass.' When they ask a young man named Junior whether he's dealing cannabis, he invites them back to his apartment where they meet the three other occupants. Krug (played by the brilliant method actor David Alexander Hess), Sadie, the group's sex toy, and Weasel, the sleaziest of imaginable perverts it comes as no surprise that this bloke is a famous pornstar. The moment the girls enter the apartment Junior locks the door, trapping them inside. Krug suddenly appears before the girls from a hidden position, gleefully saying - 'Gotcha!' Suddenly the film has leapt into a nightmare situation which is the beginning of offensive for those who cannot take it. A word of advice, if you don't like this film now, don't bother! In an attempt to 'cross the northern border', the group venture with Phyllis and Mary in the trunk of their car. When the vehicle breaks down in the dense forestry Krug and his gang members decide to 'have a little fun', taking the weeping young girl's into the woods where they humiliate, torture, rape and eventually kill both. What follows is the most frightening scene in the history of horror. It is not the hideous atrocities committed by the group that is so terrifying, but, once the girls are dead, the group blankly stare at each other frowning, evidently repelled by their own actions. The degenerates did not plan any of these incidents; they simply got carried away. These characters are far more frightening than any monster, ghost or psycho ever committed to celluloid because they are eemphasised as real human beings. Film director George Romero already brought horror closer to home with his 1969 horror epic film, Night of the Living Dead, by replacing castles, old dark houses and distant lands with familiar everyday settings. Last House on the Left not only followed the example set by Romero, but also released onto the world third dimensional monsters, characters who could possibly be in your own garden.Aware that 'the cops is closing,' the gang ironically seeks refuge in the home of Mr. and Miss Collingwood, unaware that they are Mary's parents. There is a moment of obvious class division during the scene where the group eats spaghetti in the Collingwood's home. Krug eats open mouthed, Sadie gulps down large glasses of wine and Weasel belches loudly before stating - 'This food is impeccable.'There is an evident, albeit incongruous streak of comedy throughout the film. There are two deputies who run 'out of gas' driving to the Collingwoods' home and subsequently have to hitch a ride from a chicken truck driver. The fugitive group, when not eviscerating, mutilating and dismembering young girls are also comical. In one scene, Krug pushes Junior to the floor for dreaming about, and impersonating a frog. Another unusual aspect of the film is its soundtrack, written and composed by actor David Alexander Hess. Consisting of banjos and tambourines the 'badies theme' can be heard most of the time there isn't anything particularly gruesome happening on screen. Miss Collingwood notices that Junior is wearing Mary's necklace, then later that evening overhears the group argument -Junior: Krug, we gotta get out of here. If they found out we killed their kid... Krug: Shut up! Or you'll wind up in the lake with her.The remaining scenes of the film consist of the parents extracting revenge for their daughter's death. Miss Collingwood seduces weasel before castrating him. Krug is shot by Mr. Collingwood and then beheaded with a chain saw. Sadie in an attempt to escape runs from the house, but has her throat cut by Miss Collingwood, while Junior shoots himself with his father's gun. The deputies finally arrive to find the blood soaked couple breathless and recovering from their outburst of madness, resembling the group who were also shocked by their own sadistic actions earlier in the film.Although The Last House on the Left is undeniably relentless in its effort to disturb and horrify, it does have redeeming qualities. Under the low circumstances in which it was made, Last House on the Left was filmed mostly with hand held cameras, bringing a sense of realism to the film. The acting is somewhat amateurish, but as a debut for, both director Wes Craven and producer Sean Cunningham, this film not only grossed millions of dollars, but also has developed cult status and is constantly referred to as Wes Craven's greatest achievement.It is suggested that the Manson family massacre was influential for the making of this film. At the time of Last House on the Left's emergence, the hippie era was coming to an end, memories of the Kennedy assassination were still resonant and America could see stomach churning footage of the Vietnam broadcast on the news. The film can be seen as a representation of a nihilistic period and an evaluation of the 'decay of American culture'.The story of The Last House on the Left was loosely based on Swedish Film-maker Ingmar Bergman's earlier epic The Virgin Spring where a three shepherds similarly rape and murder a young girl before receiving their comeuppance from the girl's vengeful parents. Following the release of The Last House on the Left, a new wave in horror emerged. Hundreds of similarly themed films were produced with similar situations involving turning the tables in the name of revenge, the majority of them blatant rip-offs: House on the Edge of the Park (Ruggero Deodato, 1980); Late Night Train Murders (Aldo Lado, 1974); all very reminiscent of Craven's film.Viscerally more intense than any other horror/suspense film, The Last House on the Left will continue to provoke controversy and obtain the hearts of true devotees to a dying genre for years to come.Ironically, a last house on the left doesn't even appear in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's only a movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Last House...' is a notorious film, because of its theme of rape, murder &amp; vengeance and the often disturbing graphic violence and I admit I was interested in this film, not only because it was made by the man who gave us genre classics like 'Nightmare on Elm St', 'Serpent and the Rainbow', and 'Scream' but also because of its dubious reputation, especially in countries like the UK where this film was, or still is, banned (it will be released on DVD in the UK soon ,with about 31 seconds cut).There are many similarities with 'I spit on your Grave' another 'video nasty' (which was even more heavily cut in the UK in order to make a release on video possible), but there is also an important difference: 'Last House' was created by a skillful director, someone who had it in him to make a truly good horror film, whereas 'I Spit' is far more of an exploitation film (and therefore in many ways even more disturbing).However, 'Last House' is by no means flawless, and the excuse of the shoestring budget does not hold up totally. So many things have been said and written about this film and I know it has many fans who will defend till the end, but the acting is plain BAD. Krug is such a bad guy, it's almost laughable (I love the scene with the wee boy and the balloon!) and (I know it has been mentioned in earlier reviews...) what about these stupid cops!I've heard the new DVD edition comes with a commentary by Wes Craven and Sean S. Cunningham and I would love to hear them responding to some bizarre scenes. For example, The daughter is moving when her parents find her, and I was surprised to see that she was still alive (she is moving her head and her eyes). However, one second later her father says something like "she's dead, there's nothing more we can do". And I tell you the girl was moving, not like an extremely bad actress would move who cannot 'play dead' but really moving!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How this one became a cult classic I'll never know. After years of hearing the hype, I was a little shocked when I saw it. But not in the least bit scared. We'll cut Craven some slack as the movie was clearly done on the cheap, with minimal resources. Say, for example, decent actors. The "bad-guys," supposed to be vicious predators and psychopaths escaped from jail, are about as scary as one of the novelty gangs in THE WARRIORS.Which might be forgivable if they could act half as well as anyone in that lousy movie! The rest of THE LAST HOUSE cast are wooden and awkward. While the idea of the film is unsettling in the abstract, the execution is dreadful. The script is unconvincing and more than a little silly. There are awful gaps in logic in the story. The events could, in theory, take place -- there are none of the supernatural hijinks that are so commonplace in other horror films --yet this one still requires almost total suspension of disbelief!The only thing that saves LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT from being a complete washout are a few deft touches; unsettling electronic music overtures and a handful of arty, evocative camera shots that settle over the inevitable carnage.Otherwise this is an average cheap-o slasher flick. Save your time and money unless you are a devotee of the "genre."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sly social commentary on the absurdity of life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House On The Left is one of the most disturbing, bleak and harrowing films I've ever seen, largely thanks to the slow build-up. For the first half hour or so, Craven's film deals largely in stereotypes - the 'nice' family, the 'bad' girl, the sleazy villains who are blacker than black, the clumsy comic relief. You have no problems convincing yourself that it's only a movie. But when the thugs get those girls into the woods, Craven pulls the rug from under your feet. The going gets incredibly rough. The villains lose control in the worst way and try to pull it back by indulging in degenerate behaviour that shocks even themselves. When their playthings wind up dead, they react with a queasy combination of sorrow, regret and confusion, like children who've just dropped an ice-cream on the road. It's this middle section that provides the film with its formidable reputation. But there's more to it than that - as David Hess (who plays the ringleader of the thugs with chilling authority) has pointed out, Last House also points to the absurdity of the human condition. The only cops in town are lamebrained incompetents. The villains are amateur-night goons who resort to sickening violence when the slightest hindrance to their plans comes to light. The victims are helpless innocents whose suffering is magnified by the fact that it's all happening practically in their own back yard. The revenge - taken by one girl's whitecollar parents - is a clumsy, slipshod affair that succeeds more by accident than design. Everything in this film's moral universe is hopelessly askew, and Craven never misses a trick in showing us how and why it's the way it is, or in providing a window of understanding into how acts of callous violence occur. The film's shoddy technical credits only add to the convincing, documentary feel. If you like slick horror films that place awesome effects and cheap shocks above skin-crawling tension and food for thought, you'll hate Last House. If you're prepared for a dark night of the soul that'll haunt you for weeks to come, then you should go out and buy this film at once.</fullReview>

The plot... well there is no plot... you just follow two girls on their way to a concert, when they ask a guy on the corner, if he knows were they can buy drugs. He lore's them into a building, where the rest of the gang is hiding &amp; they beat &amp; rape the girls. The next day, they take them to a secluded lake &amp; repeat the act. As one girl tries to run, she is chased, caught then killed. Then they kill the other girl. The killer than take refuge in one of the girls parents, unknowingly. Once the parents find out, they killed their daughter they decided to get revenge. The mother actually hurts one of the killers by giving him oral sex then biting his member off. Yea, you read that right. This film is so juvenile &amp; pointless. I was angry after watching this film, because crap like this gets made. Avoid at all costs!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If it hadn't been banned would anybody care about it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought this on DVD as a horror movie not really knowing what it was about, just that it was supposed to be a 'scary movie' and that it had been banned in the past (not difficult going back 20 years or more). Having watched a version with only 16 seconds cut I have to say that while the events depicted in this film would in real life be deeply scary and repulsive, this film just isn't as extreme as the hype would suggest. I find it hard to believe that this film had 'grown men weeping'. There are a few MAJOR reasons why this film fails - dire dialogue, awful acting, and some totally incongruous 'comedy music' scenes. This film started life as an exploitation movie and that's all it is. It really isn't saying anything about violence, Vietnam, etc. at all, whatever the pseud-academics might say - it's just a shocker for shock's sake. There's nothing wrong with that but this is a low-budget first effort and it shows. It's not as realistically horrible as 'Henry' and not as gory as any number of films that have come along since.This is a noteworthy film simply because there had been nothing like it before. By the standards of the early 70's it was an extreme and very different film. By today's standards it's just cheap and unpleasant and it's notoriety says more about the feeble mentality of censorship than about the film itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, let me tell you that I'm getting really angry when I read most other user comments. They all go like "oh, it's not that scary" and "This film isn't disturbing" and, even worse: "Scream was much better". I beg your pardon? Do these people fail to realize that this was the best movie Wes Craven ever did ? And what the hell do they mean ...not disturbing at all ? Last house on the left is like the definition of disturbing !!! Sorry, I had to spill my guts out on that one...Now for the movie. Let's keep one thing in mind here. This film was made in 1972. It's actually scary to itself that this film is way ahead on its time. Same thing with TCM, both these movies handle about a subject most people wouldn't even dream to mention it on film. There just are some films that couldn't be placed into categories. Neither can you call them bad or good, because even if you didn't like them you still have to admit they were very important to the world of cinema. Last house on the left is one of those films. Now, I liked it. I even liked it a lot, but still my respect for this film is even bigger than my love for it. Because I recognize it as a landmark. In horror and in cinema in general. Mari and Phyllis are on their way to a hard-rock festival when they get kidnapped by escaped villains. 3 men and one wicked lady. These people humiliate the girls, rape them and eventually kill them both. Their car broke down in front of the house were Mari lived. Her parents let them spend the night there and during their stay the parents find out they killed their daughter. The set up a whole ambush to avenge their little girl... This film was brought to us by 2 major names in the field of horror. Sean S. Cunningham and Wes Craven. At the time they made Last house they didn't know yet that they would be responsible for the biggest hype in horror 30 years later. Characters they've created are set in a line-up (Freddy VS Jason) I think they were both at their peak here. I respect them mostly for what they made here, cause I can imagine it's not easy to make such a controversial film in the early 70's. You must watch this film. For the brutality and for the emotions especially. And if you can, try to get your hands on the special edition DVD which was brought out recently. It contains very fascinating interviews with both creators of this film in which they explain who hard it was to bring it to the public. I can't praise it enough. As a horror fan but also a film freak in general I recommend this film to everyone who isn't too weak-hearted.My humble opinion on LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT = 10/10. and I'm not being generous... it really deserves this rating.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the eve of her seventeenth birthday, Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) tells her parents that she is going to the concert of underground band Bloodlust in New York with her friend Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham). She borrows the family's car and heads with her friend to a dangerous neighborhood in the city. Meanwhile, the sadistic and cruel escapees Krug Stillo (David A. Hess) and Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred Lincoln) are hidden in a hideout with their partners Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Krug's addicted son Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) after killing two guards and one shepherd in their runaway. The two girls seek marijuana near the theater and meet Junior that offers some Colombian grass to them. They go to his apartment and are subdued by the criminals that rape Phyllis. On the next morning, they hide the girls in the trunk of their convertible and head to Canada. However, they have a problem with the car's rod and they stop on the road close to Mari's house. When Phyllis tries to escape, the gang stabs her to death and shots Mari after humiliating and raping them. They seek shelter in Mari's home, but during the night, her mother overhears a conversation of the criminals telling that they have killed her daughter. She tells her husband and they plot a scheme to revenge the death of their princess. A couple of days ago I saw the 2009 remake of "The Last House on the Left" and I decided to see the original 1972 version, which is a raw low budget movie based on the storyline of 1960 Ingmar Bergman's "Jungfrukällan". The 1972 movie has a more realistic and simple story and the weakest part are the two clumsy redneck policemen that are ridiculous and never funny. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Aniversário Macabro" ("Macabre Birthday")</fullReview>

Too many comments that say its disturbing might make u wonna watch it out of curiosity. Don't. You wont miss anything. Anybody could have made this film given some very bad actors and a very low budget (fake blood and rented cars :D ah also some broken chairs)..Actually this film was made to show some nudes (even the raped girls moan like they like it :DDD) and some Totally out-of-character massacre scenes.

		<shortDescription>one of the best films I will never watch again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had put off watching this film despite hearing good things about until the death of horror maestro Wes Craven last week. Having read aspects of the plot online I wasn't sure, even after watching Gaspar Noe's Irreversible that I could handle The Last House on the Left. However after deciding I could not claim to be a Wes Craven fan without watching it I mentally prepared myself and put the film on. For starters I recommend that you avoid reading about the plot of this film before watching it, difficult as that may be due to its age and notoriety. This review does not contain huge spoilers but will cover some key plot points. So, the film begins. It is the most seventies thing I have ever seen, but not in a negative way. The cinematography is great and the characters are believable and likable. The film benefits from being made in this time period as it allows the film to take its time making the audience really get to know the characters - and had one not had prior knowledge of the film, it would be possible to believe it is a merry little film about two hippie friends having a great time going to a concert. We are also however introduced to the antagonists - radios in the background of scenes clueing us in to the escape of psychopathic criminal Krug and his family. We also see the family themselves lounging around in their home, which will later become the location for the disequilibrium in the film and the site at which Phyllis and Mari are taken hostage. Now to the infamous crux of the film, the rape scenes. Yes, they are uncomfortable, as they should be, however, Craven is careful to toe the line and never cross into sleaze or eroticism of the acts portrayed, in fact he even cut some of the forced lesbian scene after the film was finished as he believed he had gone too far. This is supposed to be horrible, and it is. These senses are long and painstaking to watch but necessary to sit through in order to appreciate the second act of the film. This is where I believe the film lets itself down a little, something I am not sure whether has been changed in the 2009 version. Maybe after watching the first half was too bloodthirsty, but personally I think that Krug and his gang did not suffer enough. The realisation my Mari's mother was not done particularly well and I didn't find their revenge to be equal to the crimes committed to their daughter and her friend. Having said that the idea was unique and brilliant to have the criminals end up at the parents house. Perhaps my view that the ending is not horrible enough shows that Wes Craven has made a film that garners such strong feelings in those that watch it that during the end scenes we are yelling for the dad to just starting chopping bits of of Krug with the chainsaw already. For some horror fans who have grown up on Saw and Hostel this may not seem like a typical 'horror' film, however it is a classic and it deserves to be revered as one. It is dated, (the music and shooting style, clothing, acting) but this does not detract from the horror and I can only imagine how shocking it was to audiences at the time. Well worth a watch if you are a fan of the genre, rape revenge films in general (Straw Dogs, I Spit on Your Grave...) or the director. It is one of the best films I will never watch again, and remember keep telling yourself "It's only a movie".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many years before they would both begin slasher franchises that would compete with each other, debuting filmmaker Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham collaborated on this ugly but compelling bit of cinema. The filmmaking is undeniably crude, but the subject matter is effectively upsetting. "The Last House on the Left" offers up the kind of experience that one doesn't easily shake, and may engender very personal love-it-or-loathe-it reactions. The performances aren't slick and polished, but they're still right on the money. One feels for the victims and feels the need for a shower just watching our Manson Family-type antagonists.Two teenage girls, Mari (Sandra Peabody), and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham), are on their way to a rock concert when they make the impulsive - and fatal - decision to try to score some grass. This brings them into contact with prison escapee Krug Stillo (David Hess) and his grimy associates, Fred 'Weasel' Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln), Sadie (Jeramie Rain), and Krugs' illegitimate, junkie son Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler). This gang of lowlifes puts the girls through a nightmare of torture and degradation, but their comeuppance comes from an appropriate source due to an incredible coincidence.An acknowledged reworking of Ingmar Bergmans' "The Virgin Spring", this features some very potent violence and gore. For our victims, it plays like a bad dream that seems to have no end. To provide us with some respite from the horror, Craven creates a film that is unfortunately mixed tonally. The comedy relief from incompetent cops Marshall Anker and Martin Kove is simply too silly. Also, Hess's score is a little too upbeat for a chase scene that should be more harrowing.Peabody and Grantham are appealing, even if their characters don't act too sensibly. It's also not hard to feel bad for Junior, who is just pathetic. Richard Towers and Cynthia Carr are okay as Maris' parents, but the show entirely belongs to the villains. Hess in particular proves to have a real presence, and a real knack for playing the most degenerate character imaginable.There's one very memorable gag involving Carr and Lincoln, and a delicious final fight between sadist and avenger.Future director Steve Miner was an assistant editor, production assistant, and bit player (as one of the hippies taunting the cops).Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marie and her derelict friend Phylis are both a couple of teenage hippies heading out to a rock concert for Marie's 17th birthday (much to her parents' concern). While heading to the concert they stop in a bad part of town, are lured into a house when they try to buy weed, and get locked inside with three escaped psychopathic maniacs. Krug is the leader of the gang, a tall and menacing guy with bad 70's disco-style hair, always wielding his pocketknife. Sadie is the bisexual girl in the gang, and pretty messed up as it later on shows. Weasel is a prolific peeping tom, child molester and rapist. The only one in the gang who is not so much a murderer as just a guy being dragged along for the ride, is Junior, Krug's teenage son, who is addicted to heroin and sticks around so he can get it easily.While Marie's mom and dad frantically try to locate her, calling two bumbling police officers who aren't much help, the gang drives the two kidnapped girls out to the woods (coincidentally next-door to Marie's house), and start torturing the two girls, forcing them into all kinds of disturbing acts. When Phylis suddenly escapes and begins rushing through the woods to get help, Marie is left alone with Junior, who tries to help her get away but is unsure of what to do. Phylis is located by Weasel, who stabs her repeatedly, and Sadie pulls out her internal organs while Krug cuts her arm off, bringing it back with him to scare Marie. After he rapes her, she loses hope and wanders into the river, where she's shot to death. The killers dress in new clothes, heading to the next-door house pretending to be traveling insurance salesmen... unknown to them, the wife soon discovers from Junior what happened, and plans with her husband to avenge Marie and Phylis.As disturbing as much of this film was, with many graphic, gory and perverted scenes, there is a director's cut version that removes most of these scenes if you'd rather view it without them. Last House on the Left has a comedic side too, mainly coming from the two cops who go through many ordeals to track down the two hippie girls and the criminals, from boarding a truck of chickens to getting the bird flipped at them from a car of hippies speeding down the road. The soundtrack was pretty good, as was the acting. Being an early 70's film it has a lot of hippie stuff in it, from Marie giving Junior a peace sign necklace to the hippie-type soundtrack, the clothes the characters wear, everything. My only complaint is the graphic nudity, I love this film but I was fourteen when I first saw it and thought the two girls being forced to have sex on-screen was a little much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ground Breaking Rape and Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last House on the Left. The infamous rape revenge movie that caused movie goer's everywhere to utter the phrase "It's only a movie...only a movie". I think this was the first flick to really start the rape revenge theme, although it was sort of an unofficial remake of The Virgin Spring, an Ingmar Bergman film made 12 years previously. Being from the 70s, and part of the whole Grindhouse theme, this one really takes things to a whole new level of discomfort. Banned, and butchered by editors, I don't believe the intact version of the movie even exists?! Now that's extreme!So, we have Mari, a sweet teen and her friend Phyllis, who wanna go to a concert but decide to score some pot on the way. They meet up with some escaped convicts and... well... things go very bad very quickly and the convicts seek refuge... at Mari's parents house. And well, that's where the revenge part comes into it. Okay, I'll be honest, the first time I saw this movie, I hated it! I felt the pacing was way off, the soundtrack was terrible but the most unforgivable thing was the goofy cops, who were supposed to be the comic relief, but ended up just being infuriating! I actually still hate those cops with a passion, but I no longer hate the movie. I actually really admire it now. Here's why;The pacing. I was incorrect to say it was off. It's actually pretty awesome. It starts out as your typical B grade movie, but the middle section is some of the most disturbing cinema you'll ever see. It feels so real, almost like a documentary, you'll feel dirty just for watching it. And of course, the final act is back to B grade territory, and sure it's a bit silly, but it's satisfying none the less.David Hess. Mr Hess plays Krug, the main escaped convict and he just oozes with slime. One of the most memorable villains in a movie, it's no wonder that director Wes Craven will pay homage to the name in another, more popular Craven flick later down the track. Success in being disturbing. That middle section, as disturbing as it was, was ground breaking! The tag line "just keep telling yourself is only a movie" could not have been more relevant, as it felt so real. It's enough to make your skin crawl. This part was scary!The revenge. As over the top as it is, it's still a damn good revenge sequences, my favourite being the castration. If I'm going to watch poor girls being tortured, I sure as hell want a satisfying revenge sequence, and this delivers! So, final thoughts. This is actually a damn good movie. A shame that we will never have the full film, but damn, does it get nasty in parts. Highly recommended for lovers of exploitation and revenge films. Thankyou.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I can understand why people didn't like it at the time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this, a few years ago, I watched the remake. It was pretty good but the main rape scene really put me off, I really didn't like it because it was too much in your face with no subtle effect and they made it last forever. Horror is my passion, I absolutely love it. I can deal with gore and violence but not rape. Time went by and I watched the original The Hills Have Eyes and I loved it. I then thought I wander what this is like. I did hear from friends that its not that bad for today's standards, so I plucked up the courage and watched it. I have to say I did enjoy it.The characters were connective and believable. I wish that I had a chance to get to know Mari a little bit more so I can feel more for her. The villains were really effective and you do feel a sense of unease when you see them. A part I really liked about this film is when after the things the villains have done to the girls, there are shots of the villains just keeping quite with facial expressions that say 'What have we just done?!'This gives the sense that they have a bit of remorse, which you don't see in movies anymore. I really liked the way it give us the audience a bit of surprised feeling, thinking they are human after all.The acting is good enough. It is slightly dated but that doesn't bother me. I also really like the picture quality of the film which, I think gives a raw effect. The atmosphere of the film is great, its bleak and suspenseful.Now the scenes of what the villains do to the girls, yes they are horrible and made me uncomfortable watching them. But what they do is that you see them begin to do something and then it focuses on a character watching it happen in shock or discussed or it even cuts to another scene in general. I love the way thats done because it leaves it to your imagination and you knowing whats going to happen. Well done Wes. We don't need to see it in full detail. The main rape scene was still disturbing and the worst bit in the film, but they didn't drag it on for too long. I can understand why it was banned and why people were shocked by it.The scenes where the villains are staying at the parents house and find out what happened to their daughter were the best parts of the movie. It kept me on the edge of my seat thinking 'this going to get nasty'. The other great thing is that it didn't focus too much on gore. Which horror films are overloaded with these days. Again it doesn't bother me, but for me, it needs to be used for appropriately.The only thing I really didn't like about the film is the choice of soundtrack. At the end it did get rather annoying. For example, a chase scene, they use banjo happy chirpy music. How does that fit may I ask? The filming and cinematography really worked and that's one of the reasons how this is effective. Overall, it was very good, except the soundtrack. When watching it try not to get too bothered and try to focus on what's going on. I also warn you that this is not for the faint hearted. If you think you're going to get offended by watching this, please don't. Wes Craven fans (which I have become a bigger fan of, loved Nightmare On Elm Street, Serpent And The Rainbow, Scream etc.) I recommend you this so you can see what style of filming he uses and where he began his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a "Great" Film, but not Nearly as Bad as some say</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wont delve into the story too much as there are multiple reviews detailing every inch of this movie.I find it hard to accurately rate this movie. The acting was fine. Some people say it's beyond perfect at making it seem "real", others say it's the worst acting ever put to film. I thought the acting was decent overall. A few parts the acting was great, a few parts... not so much, but overall not too bad.The story was very "the Virgin Spring"y'. I felt for Craven's first film he did a good job in creating the feel of "the real". Some poor transitions and a few oddball choices but overall not too bad there either.There are a few scenes with some great angles that I can't recall seeing in films before 1972 so I'd say Craven did some good work with a few key shots (last rape scene before gun shot).After checking a couple of pages of reviews I'm still shocked how many times I read through reviews here and see people calling random movies the "WORST MOVIE EVER!" in large bold font. Seriously? This is the worst movie you've ever seen? =/ Must not watch many films... Hell there's big budget movies these days that reach epic lows 'LHotL' couldn't dream of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to view this film in a certain way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen a lot of comments on this movie so we wont have to tell the storyline anymore.I watched this movie and the first half of the movie disgusted me enormously. It shows there were sick people back in the seventies too so maybe this is given hope for the future. From the part that the parents found there daughter, it became shockingly unrealistic and it helped to get over the shocking scenes you get to see in the violence and rape scenes. It satisfies your revenge feelings against the three violators but nothing more than that and I question myself what the film would have become if it went like the first half to the end with the bad guys winning, which is normal to see in horror-movies.If I see the commentary here I don't think much people below thirty can understand why this film has become a cult classic. it was probably the first movie which showed twisted people, sex and violence so open and realistically so who cares about bad acting by some of the actors. You got something to see that was never shown before and I may only hope that it gave a lot of people an insight how sick some people can be. Now we are living in times that there is nothing new under the sun and it's almost impossible to impress people anymore because everything is pretty much done. I haven't seen the 2009 version yet, but seeing the trailer I think it's a better ENTERTAINMENT-movie to watch, with much better filming, acting and entertainment-music but it will never equal the realism shown in this movie because it looks like a home-made video.For closure; I really can't believe that there are people saying that they found the rape and violence scenes to boring for words. I personally think that if you can see a girl get raped and murdered like that without any emotion at all there is something seriously wrong with you and you need to taste something more of the real life instead of the movie-world with buckets of bloods and guts flying all over the screen.Giving this movie a vote is difficult because of the double message. You shouldn't like movies where people are raping and killing for fun, but as for the shock and gore way back in the seventies it gets 8 out of 10 from me</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A courageous film to release</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wes Craven's got some nerve putting this thing out...I've got to hand it to him. And you'd have to have a lot of courage to try this film, and a strong stomach to make it through.This film is courageous because it pushes aside all sense of human decency and portrays the most horrible human behavior imaginable...and then plays all this light and funny music in the background. It's like, one minute, these teen girls are being violated and humiliated in the woods; and then the movie switches to these Barney Fife cops whose incompetence will have you laughing...then it's back to the sick stuff again and your stomach is turning.This movie will disturb you. It will disgust you, offend you, and make you think. This isn't merely shock, however. There is a moral to the story. Unlike many mindless slasher films, the villains have not entirely lost their humanity, not even Sadie. They do not laugh maniacally after torturing, raping, humiliating, and murdering their victims. No, they actually seem remorseful. The look in their faces was priceless. Then the look on the face of the vengeful parents...it says it all. Wes Craven is showing the darkest depths of the human soul...and no matter the cause, violence eats away at us. Well done Wes Craven! I wish I could go more into Krug's son, Junior, but I would be spoiling if I did. But I tell you now, some of the most disturbing aspects of this film involve that dysfunctional father son relationship.I give it a well earned 9 out of 10. Some of those parts in the woods were a little over the top. Also, why was Krug the only one to get a piece of action? Seems Weasel was just as much a perv as Krug, if not more so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film well worth watching...if you can stomach it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Admittedly I have a peculiar penchant for the bizarre and gruesome (especially with the internet being as saturated as it is with filth, I've seen my fair share of both, and to be honest, quite a few things worse than what is presented in this film) so understand that this review is heavily biased. Last House on the Left one-ups just about every other horror movie I've seen in regards to the depravity and intensity the scenes convey; however, what makes the film artful is the fact that there are no "action shot" (in other words, you see weapons, you see blood, you see nudity and in some instances you see the aftermath, but you're never shown the act itself) which is first an artistic choice and second an indication of the film's age, as special effects weren't prevalent in this era of film-making. Ultimately this is a film designed to elicit a visceral response from the audience and for those who are genuinely disturbed from viewing it might benefit by reciting the film's tag-line, which is, "It's only a movie...it's only a movie...it's only a movie..." The only gripe I have about the film is the sheriff and his deputy's incompetence interspersed throughout the film as a sort of "comedic" break, which puts the film in an even more bizarre context. Fan's of Rob Zombie may also notice that the title-card music for the film's trailer serves as the intro for the song "Living Dead Girl" which is ironic to say the least.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most disturbing horror films I have seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found Last House On The Left to be a very disturbing film. Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) plans to celebrate her 17th birthday going to a concert with her friend, Phyllis Stone (Lucy Grantham). Her parents express concerns about the band they are going to see called Bloodlust and Mari's friendship with Phyllis, who thought to be more lower class than they are. They let her go, and give her a gift before she leaves which is a peace symbol necklace.On the way to the city, Mari and Phyllis hear a radio report of a recent prison escape involving violent criminals by the names of Krug Stillo (David Hess), his son Junior, Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Fred "Weasel" Podowski (Fred J. Lincoln). On arrival in the city, Mari and Phyllis walk around the streets, trying to find someone who might sell marijuana. Eventually, they run into a man called Junior, who leads them back to an apartment where they are immediately trapped by the criminals. Phyllis, who resists, is punched in the stomach and raped, as Mari watches in horror. Mari's parents, meanwhile are prepare a surprise party for her. The next morning, the girls are locked in a car trunk and driven to the countryside as the gang want to leave the state. Their vehicle breaks down right in front of Mari's house while the police are talking to Mari's parents about her disappearance. Unable to get their car fixed, they drag the kidnapped girls into the woods. In the woods, the girls are untied and subjected to several tortures, including Phyllis forced to urinate into her own jeans, then stripping herself completely naked followed by stripping Mari completely naked as the gang watches. I Think that this must be the most disturbing horror film i have ever seen.</fullReview>

I'm not one to condone rape but the rape scene in this looked more real than similar scenes in other horror movies. Another scene I liked is the scene were the killers take the intestines out of one the girls, I found it both funny and painful when one of the killers gets castrated, it was so painful looking but funny the way the guy screaming.another favorite scene of mine is the revenge at the end.

		<shortDescription>Scary?NO. Silly? YES!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>''The Last House on the Left'' was one of those movie that embarked on the screens after fuss in Vietnam, in time when American were still in some sort of trauma after the war, so, this movie can be considered as something disturbing and let's say obscene for that time, but generally, this movie is just another of USA's mediocre thrillers from '70's. This is not a horror, there aren't vampires, zombies, what we have here is a bunch of junkies, two dull girl, two stupid cops and too much ''clever and smart'' wife and husband, actually father and mother of one of the dull girls.Scenes of horror, have morbid atmosphere, but nothing more, there aren't any scary or too much perverted scenes as some people would say, there is nothing to be afraid of, really. The guys which plays those of the Krug's gang are silly, dull and hilarious.David A. Hess, who plays the leader of the gang have so much warm and kind face, that even when he slaughter's his victim, he look positive. Taking him for the leading role of the leading gang member is a miss big time.Character of Weasel, played by Fred J. Lincoln is also the dumb selection for that role. His look is so inconclusive and lazy, that there's no any spot in which you can find this character psychotic and mean as movie wants to show him.Again, there is Marc Sheffler who plays Junior Stillo, son of Krug Stillo. His character may be the funniest of all. With his dull and idiotic lines who looks like he was jumped up from some Woodie Allen movies.Gee.Okay, enough with characters, let's say something about the movie. Even that this movie contains violence and some little amount of gore, there are lots of cheap comedy elements, cartoon like situations, and silly songs played in the background of the scenes. Acting is poor, but pertinent for such low-budget movie like this. On the other side, this is the first Wes Craven's movie, so all of this goofs and mistakes don't take too much serious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good generational horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the entire movie fun and feel-good, and I think that's what made the movie for me. Craven nailed the 70's, and I think this is the perfect example of a generational movie. It's sad more generational movies like this aren't made in our time.The brutal kills would have been much more effective if they were shown on screen, but I understand in the time they wouldn't have been allowed. However, the ideas themselves are a lot more unnerving than "I've seen that a hundred times" gore like you get in movies like The Midnight Meat Train.If not for Alien, I think I would call this the definitive horror film of its decade.I'm not sure what else to say. It's just a freaking fun movie that defies almost all the clichés of the typical kidnapping/vengeance movie, as well as keeping characters a lot more interesting than the copy/paste of most horror today.Forget The Mist of The Decent or whatever typical horror you plan on renting, get this.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An antique ready to be refinished and brought back to life...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a Wes Craven movie that would be a great remake. The special effects are outdated and the violence is almost comedic or missing the shock factor compared to modern day horror films in my opinion. I was recommended this movie and was deeply disappointed. I did finish it, but it took real self control to make myself sit through this terribly outdated movie that was probably less that average in its day. I am not sure it would need more than eight or ten minutes cut out to be ready for non-cable television.It does however have a great storyline. I do recommend it for a remake. Look at the comparison between "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" of 1974 and the more current 2003 remake and the same for "Night of the Living Dead" from 1968 vs. the later more modern 1990 version. I hope to see "Last House on the Left" again someday as a modern day remake with more suspense, darker violence, more nudity, rougher forced sex and bloodier and more realistic kill scenes for all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*This review is for Vestron Video.17-year-old Mari is going out to to see a concert with a friend named Phyllis. On the way they encounter a group of murderers and are abducted by them, what follows is the horrific sexual abuse, torture and murder of the two girls. After the killers murder the two girls they take shelter in a house owned by a married couple not knowing that they are the parents of Mari, when the parents find out what the killers have done, they carry out a horrible, gruesome revenge.A very poorly directed, acted, written (except two really ironic twists), photographed, scored, and especially edited film. It also happens to cruel, sadistic, and dumb and unbelievable, especially in the second half and at the end where there is plenty of unintentional humor. It does contain a minimum amount of suspense during the first chase sequence, and the twist are pretty good, but still fall into the category of being unbelievable. This also happens to rip-off the film The Virgin Spring, a much better film, and the only reason it is remembered to this very day is because of the talent behind the camera, even though they displayed very little here. Almost laughable film would be easier to take if it weren't so explotive and violent. Editing that looks like it was done with an out of control chainsaw, slack direction, inept script and terrible performances are only a few of it's problems.Rated R for Extreme Graphic Violence, Nudity, Profanity and Rape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A wasted opportunity...a terrible film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I absolutely hate the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies and have considered Wes Craven to be the most overrated directors of all time.But I read in several places that his directorial debut, "The Last House on the Left" was supposed to be his best effort and far better than his later movies.After reading the movie synopsis, it seemed promising enough and so I decided to watch this movie. But I was in for a disappointment, to find a great premise for a film (which is a rip-off of Ingmar Bergman's 'The Virgin Spring'), wasted completely.There are several reasons why the film is utterly tasteless..To name a few of its bad qualities...there's some terrible, terrible acting..with the exception of perhaps David Hess who aptly plays a sick, demented rapist. There is a completely out-of-place soundtrack and background score, which is far from the mood that any particular scene is supposed to create!! I mean, if it's gotta be a shock thriller, then there has to be a creepy soundtrack to complement it. But what you get is a cheerful 70s style score instead, playing in the background as the brutal events in this "movie" unfold! The much touted "graphic" violence is mostly off-screen and not much is actually shown..what we get is more of the crappy soundtrack (electronic PC speaker-like sound for stabbing?!?! Gimme a break!) and the moments AFTER the brutality has actually happened. And did I mention the completely unnatural sequences and mannerisms from the characters?? The reaction and the subsequent actions of the parents of the brutally raped/murdered girl are so unnatural, I don't know whether to blame it on the bad acting or the bad direction.Oh..and the icing on this stale and tacky cake is the totally unnecessary comical acts of the two bungling cops! (good grief!) Did we really need that in a shock thriller/horror whatever-you-may-wanna-call-it movie? And why use them as fillers in this already concise movie with a running length of not more than 85 minutes? These really ridiculous comic scenes have some more of that stupid music playing in the background!All in all, there is absolutely nothing in this movie that can give it the tag of being dark or shocking! This is a wasted opportunity..a premise that would've made a great picture, had it been handled by a more talented director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic slice of exploitation cinema!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film was before I'd seen a lot of exploitation, and I have to say that I found the whole thing to be quite uncomfortable; though I won't say I didn't enjoy it. I have now seen many an exploitation flick, and I will still say that The Last House on the Left is a shocking and uncomfortable slice of exploitation cinema. The film takes influence from Ingmar Bergman's best film, The Virgin Spring, though director Wes Craven has seen fit to add in a load of sex, gore and general sleaze. The plot is completely simple, as is the case with most seventies exploitation flicks, and this gives the film more room to do what it's really meant to do - shock and disgust the viewer. We focus on two young girls who decide to go to a rock concert. On the way, scoring some pot seems like a good idea and one of them asks someone they think is a dealer if he can spare any. It turns out that he was the wrong person to ask, as he's a part of a gang of escaped convicts, and when he takes the girls to meet the rest of the gang; they decide it's time to have some fun...The Last House on the Left, aside from being a nasty film, is also a rather strange one - and that's mostly owing to the soundtrack and apparent misplaced humour. The humour seems to be in place to offset the terror, but if you ask me it makes the film even more shocking, as it feels like Craven is having a laugh at the plight of the two young victims. It's also quite funny. The film would appear to fairly ambiguous other than that, however, as Craven doesn't force the audience into making a judgement on any character in the film; they are all basically what they are. Wes craven would go on to make a number of important horror films after this one; but none of them manage to capture the raw shock value of The Last House on the Left, and I would not hesitate to call this his best film. The film is gritty and the production values are quite low, which is pretty much what you would expect from a film like this; but that is certainly not a bad thing. The film only runs for about eighty minutes, but the film certainly gets its message across, and Craven also manages to keep it entertaining for the duration, which is to its benefit. Overall, The Last House on the Left is bound to divide opinions; but in mine it's an out and out horror masterpiece!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, I love the new cover art that tries to make this film look like some horror film. The title, Last House on the Left, really has nothing to do with the movie itself.The basic plot is that two girls sneak out to the city and promptly get kidnapped by some escaped murderers. They are then beaten, raped and eventually murdered. They then have to spend the night in the house of one of the victim's parents who find out what happens and plot their bloody revenge in unusual ways.While it's an interesting story, it's nothing special and maybe it's just me but I'd hardly classify this film as a horror movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Graphic Intrigue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can't think of another film in recent memory that's left me feeling so conflicted. On one hand, Wes Craven's 'Last House on the Left' is an intriguing character study. On the other, it's repulsive. Being Craven's first film, 'Last House' is a very amateurish, documentary-like approach to film. Yet through all its flaws, this sadistic film just makes the grade.On their way to a concert, friends Mair and Phyllis are encountered and kidnapped by a small group that includes several local escaped convicts. Powerless against the gang of psychopaths, the two teenagers are raped and brutally murdered. Unknowingly, the killers seek refuge in the house of one of the victims. When the reality of their situation sets in and they uncover the gruesome truth, the parents will enact a plan of revenge so haunting, so brutal.'Last House' lacks the substance that makes some of Craven's later films so memorable, but there remains a certain edge to this movie that makes it so interesting. It's like nothing that's ever been made before, at least that I've seen, and there's a level of intrigue that makes it impossible to look away. Its 1972 release ruffled more than a few feathers, and while it may seem tame by today's standards, its frank approach to rape and torture is still disturbing even today. It's distasteful in every sense of the word, throwing morals and values right out the window. But there's a fascination to it all, watching it all unfold in graphic detail. I can only imagine what could have been done with this film had its script been written in more than three days, and with a bigger budget. But its gritty and raw style is appropriate enough, and gives the film a startling realistic atmosphere.There's nothing particularly stand-out about the film's cast, they're all rather tepid. But it passes. Clearly, David Hess is the best thing about this film, playing the ringleader of the gang. He's ruthless and unnerving, along with Fred Lincoln, Hess's sidekick known as 'Weasel' (he actually does look like a weasel). And for all that they're put through, Sandra Cassel and Lucy Grantham deliver haunting performances as the two teens who are humiliated and reduced to something less than human. Jeramie Rain's animal-like features put her to good use, and Marc Sheffler, who plays Hess's son, is worth watching if only for his character's climactic scene at the end.In the end, 'Last House on the Left' can be seen as a launching pad to a career with much more promise and potential. Wes Craven's debut film isn't bad, it just isn't very good either. Take it for what it is, a film whose main purpose is to push the envelope as much as it possibly can. And for its day and age, it succeeded in doing just that. My suggestion? For casual horror fans, stick to Craven's later, and much better, work. 'Last House' is better suited to those interested in exploring the beginnings of a horror master.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before the massacre in Texas there was...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...Wes Craven's first feature film.Two girls head out to the city for a night out at a concert. Unfortunately for them they run into some recently escape lunatics and are savagely raped and murdered. In an ironic twist of fate the escape criminals must stay someplace over night which happens to be one of the girl's parents place...This film has everything you'd expect from camp and shock horror. Since it is one of the earliest, if the the earliest, of its kind it probably originated many of the elements that horror film freely splatter about today. It is brutal and hard to take even by today's standards and that is due to lack of over doing things. The killers don't really look like killers, they look like people - they're sick in the mind not in the face. In fact if it wasn't for what they did they mind as well be regular day to day people, maybe a little eccentric, but then who isn't? It is this point that ultimately sticks when you realize that the typical person is potentially capable of some truly sick and twisted s**t.However, the film does lack a certain punch in that most horrifying thing doesn't come at the end, which it really should. The biggest gouts of gore are in the middle so the kicker ends up being hardly a nudge. Maybe it's because Wes Craven, and everyone working on the film for that matter, were rookies. In addition the film creaks rather slowly in parts which is fine, but there is little atmospheric build up and the film ends up being a lot less cinematic than Craven's next feature "The Hills Have Eyes" or "Texas Chainsaw Massacre." However, overall it is a good film for devoted horror fans to watch, but others steer away. --- 6/10DVD is unrated with violence, gore, brutality and rape. Not for the faint of heart.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Finally got to see this, probably the only one of the so-called seminal horror films that I had not yet seen. It's really not that good, and the subject matter has been tackled in better ways in better films than this. I really believe that Craven didn't completely know what he was doing and just ended up getting lucky regarding all the hype about this, plus the fact that it was pretty grisly for the time. He did a hell of a lot better with the Hills Have Eyes with similar subject matter, I would say. It's not worthless, but definitely not great and not on par with the other films of the period that are seminal horror films. Somebody had the audacity to consider Bergman and Godard as influential to this thing. Well, they both used film stock and cameras, and that's about it as far as I'm concerned. If you want to see this story done right, get a copy of the European giallo terror film, The Night Train Murders. It's a hundred times better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawed but deeply disturbing shocker</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my aesthetics for reviewing films is to attempt to judge what the filmmaker's intentions were and how good they executed them. If the purpose of a film is to scare the audience, I won't concentrate so much on the writing and the acting. Thats why I become confused when I read a review of a film such as "Last House on the Left" and people pan it for being too disturbing. Maybe they went in with a different idea of what the film was going to be like, but you should credit Craven for managing to do what he set out to do. Still, I have to admit I don't believe this film has as much power as it could potentially have.It is true that the scenes where the two young girls are raped and subsequently murdered are horrifying. They are the most effective moments of the film and would rate probably an eight or a nine alone. Plus, the performances by the girls and the four psychos are believable and the characters are fleshed out considerably. Its obvious from these scenes that Craven wanted to create a quality picture as opposed to just exploitation drive-in fodder. For this, he deserves respect as a filmmaker.On the other hand, he seems to fumble a bit too often. For one, the comic relief characters are unfunny, annoying, and intrusive. If he had just stuck to using some of the dark humor in the other scenes, he would've been much better at maintaining tension. This is what the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" did. The music (by actor David Hess) is horrible and seems to destroy tension. Also, the second half seems a bit over-the-top. It's still suspenseful, but it really stretches the belief system and doesn't have the shocking ability to disturb that the first half does. Its a reasonably well made film with some fine performances (as well as some poor ones), and should be seen by cult film fans and horror buffs so they can make their own opinion on one of the most controversial films of all time.

		<shortDescription>Important to the genre but is it any good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Uum, what do you say about a movie that remains to this day one of the most controversial and shocking film to have ever graced the silver screen. It's pretty shocking in most all respects. Sure, the subject matter is gruesome, but so are the actors, the music and the "humor". This has "Amateur" spelled all over the place. Nothing looks to have been very competently made, just the sheer enthusiasm of breaking film boundaries and pushing it to the next level. The gritty and naturalistic look of the film is something director Craven prides himself most of and thinks of that as the primary source as to why the film was so shocking. Maybe horror enthusiasts today (like myself) have become so jaded that this stuff isn't all that shocking today. It does however have some of the most repugnant screen villains and one can't deny that David Hess does pull off his role with style (that's not to say his acting is convincing but he's got an undeniable screen presence). The humiliating mistreatment of the girls in the woods is an uncomfortable viewing experience to be sure but I do think I watched a censored version since some scenes described in other reviews where not to be found on the film I watched. It's just they look so fake, with some tremendously bad acting and I could easily think of the film's legendary tag line "it's only a movie, it's only a movie...". The ending, when the parents exact revenge, is so badly staged and executed that the intended impact does not come through. The inter cutting of the two bumbling cops as the girls are being molested show that Craven was still very much a learner, every possible momentum gets completely killed off. And that music is bad beyond words.What is immensely interesting is the story behind the film, almost worth buying the film all by itself. On most DVD editions the documentary "Celluloid crime of the century" is available and that's much more interesting than the film itself. Craven and producer Sean Cunningham are proud of the film but the actors have diverse stories to tell. In the end Last House on the Left is a film that had a huge impact, remains a cult classic and a boundary breaker, the subject of endless discussions on what could or should be allowed to portray on screen and for that reason alone it's existence is very welcome. I may not like it but it can't be denied that it's important in the horror genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty good documentary style film-making debut by Wes Craven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a young teenager, who recently turned seventeen. Mari Collingwood (Sandra Cassel) is a easy going young girl on the verge of being a woman. Mari and her friend Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) are on their way to a rock concert but they find themselves been beaten, rape and torture by a group of sadistic crazed criminals (David Hess, Fred Lincoln, Jeramie Rain and Marc Sheffler). But these criminals ended up paying the price, when they ended up in one of girl's parents home in the woods for the night.Written and Directed by Wes Craven (The Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street, Red Eye) made an brutal, realistic low budget horror film. Which it was controversial and grim, especially when the film was released in 1972. Which many critics consider to be loosely based on Ingmar Bergman's "The Virgin Springs". It is a film, i haven't had the chance to see it yet. This movie is notable for being Craven's first movie, some memorable songs by actor:Hess and strong moments of violence. The film's sense of humour makes this one less effective at times (especially an sub-plot involves two brainless cops). Craven's documentary-style film-making makes it powerful at some choice moments of dramatic terror.DVD has an good anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer (also in Pan &amp; Scan) and an fine-Dolby Digital 2.0 Mono Sound. DVD features are excellent, including an joyful commentary track by the director and producer:Sean S. Cunningham (Friday the 13th), documentary with the cast &amp; crew, outtakes &amp; dailies and more. The newest Collector's Edition has all new special features. The video and sound transfer are the same. DVD includes an new running commentary track by Hess, Lincoln and Sheffler. DVD also includes three featurettes, deleted scenes (without sound) and an unfinished short film by Wes Craven. This new DVD doesn't have the features from the 2002 DVD Edition. Despite some real flaws, this picture is still worth a look, it has certain impact also. Especially those who are about to watch it for the first time, if you have the stomach for it. Craven also edited this one also. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but extremely unworthy of its praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure if it's because I've seen films that are far more disturbing that this has claimed to be, or that I heard way too much hype for it before seeing it, but this movie is not the over-the-top, super intense, ultra-shocking movie that it is dubbed as.I should mention, before going into depth about how this really is not what it is cracked up to be, that this is still a good movie that stands up with many other 1970's horror flicks, even though this isn't horror.For 1972, when this was made, sure this was over the top. It was more violent than a lot of other movies, and even included a very, very mild rape scene. But over 30 years later, reading the reviews of it, hearing other people talking about it, you would get the impression that the movie is non-stop violence, non-stop tension, brutal, unrelenting aggression and rapes galore. You would think that it shows things that no other movie since then has shown. You would think that no other movie has come close to being as disturbing or intense as this. You'd be completely wrong. This movie, despite what anyone says, is not still as shocking and dirty and crazy and insane today as it was back then. Its intensity back then has inspired legions and legions of other, far more over the top movies.On the scale of disturbing and intense movies, with 1 being a Sesame Street movie and 10 being something that completely shocks me and gives me nightmares, Last House on the Left would get, maybe, a 4.It is labeled as a horror movie. Said by many to be one of, if not absolutely, Wes Craven's best. People have even gone so far as to say that it makes movies like Nightmare on Elm Street, Friday the 13th, Halloween, and other movies look tame and like jokes. This couldn't be further from the truth. The horror elements of this movie take a back seat. It doesn't contain enough of anything that makes a good horror movie for me to call it horror at all. This is not horror. Slasher, maybe. Suspense, perhaps. Crime, indeed. A fake, sort of tamer version of a snuff film, sure. In horror you experience a sense of darkness and dread and uncertainty. This movie does not thrive on a successful portrayal of any of these emotions. With the constant cut scenes to the idiot, comic relief police officers, and the zany music, there is no time for suspense or fear to build. There is no appropriate setting for terror. No overwhelming sense of anything that a good horror movie creates is created. There are many movies out there that develop the same kind of tension that this movie builds, and they are not horror movies.The movie builds slight tension and leads to some short lived and not-so-shocking moments of violence and "brutality". This brutality is a stabbing similar to a stabbing seen in millions of other movies, and a rape that can hardly even be considered shocking considering that no actions are shown and the reactions are rather unbelievable. Oh, and then there's a shooting. Again, not something far out.The killer/rapist and his gang make their way to the house of the parents of one of the girls, where they ultimately meet their demise. I suppose that the methods of these people dying has also been mentioned as some of the "over the top" brutality. This is again, not the case. There is brutality, sure. But it is not shown visually, nor is it something that hasn't been shown in other movies. A man gets killed with a chainsaw, but you see nothing. A man gets his penis bitten (maybe bitten off?), which I suppose is the most brutal thing in the movie. But again, you see nothing. A movie can create all kinds of brutal and unimaginably crazy things if they will not even be shown on the screen. Considering this, there wasn't anything too extreme in this. If they're not going to show the actions, why not do something even crazier? You can get away with anything. If you're not limited by technology or props or even the actions, the only limit is the imagination. Taken like this, the acts are not so extreme at all.Even a "remake" 8 years later, by the name of House on the Edge of the Park, was far more shocking and intense than this and showed a lot more. It wasn't really a remake, but had the same premise and even starred David Hess in the exact same role, with a loser, idiot friend similar to Junior from this movie. It was a total rip-off/homage to Last House on the Left, and was light years ahead of it in terms of being shocking and over the top. But again, that wasn't a horror movie either. There's nothing terrifying about Last House on the Left, nor is there anything that can still be called remotely over the top, but it still remains a good movie that is watchable at any time. But it really does not deserve to be called the many things it's been called. But watch it for its plot and characters and the events that unfold, taking them as they are. Taken as it is, it's an above average movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shocking...but entertaining?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many others I found Last House On The Left very shocking, but that doesn't translate into entertainment for me. It's good in what it sets out to do, but then it depends on if you find this sort of thing entertaining. I admire how Wes Craven chose to show the acts contained in such a gritty and realistic way, because rape and torture is not glamorous. Last House On The Left really just shows the sort of events we read about in the papers as they would happen. If you like that sort of realism, then this is your thing. As with many of Wes Craven's films, he didn't seem to realise the perfect time to end the film, and so it gets unrealistic when the murderers are themselves murdered by the parents of one of the girls they killed. Despite this I do think it's great as it shows how any human can be possessed to murder another if pushed too far. As I said, great in what it sets out to do, but not 'entertaining' as such.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Masterpiece!? Yes, the movie is disturbing but for the wrong reasons. Craven shows people committing the most brutal crimes in explicit manners. It's disturbing because people are not used to act like that. The "best" thing of the movie is that it's disturbing because you might think that it could happen to you. Reality bites sometimes."Last House On The Left" shows the behavior of a gang of rapers torturing and humiliating two innocent girls. The plot behind their actions is your typical revenge situation but in a raw manner. Craven deserves some respect for having quality gore in an exploitation flick. And I don't know if Tobe Hooper was influenced by this movie and later used the "chainsaw" idea... Craven is responsible for having many imitators during the upcoming years. I can't think of how many movies have the "last house on the..." title. Anyways, "Last House On The Left" is highly overrated. Many people praise this movie because they think it's a "must see" or a "masterpiece". Many people tend to praise something just because it's famous or polemical. Don't get me wrong. The movie is disturbing, brutal, and I liked it but not to consider it as a masterpiece. And I watched it with low expectations years ago when the exploitation craziness wasn't very popular. The production values are terrible but that helped to the reality factor. The movie looks very real and that makes it even more disturbing. I know that it's ultra low budget but that's not an excuse. The best thing in my opinion, is the brutal ending. Lots of good gore.Watch it only because there's a lot of hype surrounding it. You may like it or not but you need to accept that this isn't by any means a "masterpiece".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much missing footage, but great concept.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this film some thirty years ago, as a child. (Went with some teenagers to a drive in, hid under some coats to get in). The one thing I claim is a photographic memory, so I recall a lot which was not in the 84 minute DVD I just previewed.That seven minutes or so of cut footage mainly came from the scenes in the woods, and had a big impact on the film's violence content. I won't go into that, since there is apparently no way to prove what I saw, so I will have to review the version most of us have seen. I will curse the censors who carved this film up, as those missing scenes take a lot of the impact away.Many have excoriated the acting, but I was impressed by David Hess and the rest of the "gang". I felt they played their parts to perfection, and one must remember, even in high budget films of the '70's, there was a certain cheesiness to most films of that era. (Deliverance being a notable exception.) The musical score worked for me; The tracks "Wait for the Rain" and "Now you're all alone" in particular were very despondent, and fit the hopeless theme very well.The low budget, documentary style actually helped the movie. After all, it's a snuff flick at heart. Hard for some to watch maybe, but I appreciate films that allow me to explore my dark side. There's plenty of dark side to view here. It's an excellent film, which takes two or three viewings to appreciate. I found "Deliverance" to be very visceral, and LHOTL to be subtle. Different strokes and all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ahead Of Its Time And Full Of Good Ideas , But Poorly Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary and Phyllis are two teenage girls headed into the city for a concert to celebrate Mary's 17th birthday. While attempting to buy some weed, the girls fall into the hands of a group of escaped convicts, whom torture and eventually murder them. Trying to escape from the scene of the crime, they take refuge w/ a local family under false pretenses...that family just happens to be Mary's parents, whom soon learn the awful truth and exact revenge.Is "Last House" all it's cracked up to be? Yes and no. Though many of its ideas revolutionized modern horror, the film itself is a poorly written and edited, shoddy mess. It also doesn't help that the sound quality on both versions of the film that I've seen (85 minutes and a more widely available 82 minute cut) have such poor audio quality that I had to turn the subtitles on to understand what the characters were saying.The main characters are little more than sketches, and the pacing is awkward, with comic relief scenes that might otherwise have worked falling flat due to bad timing, with the film being slowly paced overall.The girls eventual demise is obvious within the first 30 minutes of so, but we do not get to see what exactly will happen to them until far later, being forced to sit through plot padding filler that is little more than more face time for the inept deputy and Mary's parents worrying ineffectually without actually doing much of anything to get to the bottom of their daughter's disappearance.It became so dull that I found myself paying more attention to the kicky little pieces of background music and the cool retro print decor in the Collingwood home.Once the main plot finally resumes, the dramatic tension is long dead and the tortures and murders are obviously shot to accommodate the film's shoestring budget. Gore isn't a necessary component to good horror films, but the technique of leaving the gruesome bits mostly to the imagination is a technique that requires much more building of tension than this film was ever capable of to be the least bit effective.The convicts, moment of remorse is laughable, consisting of little more than sad grimaces and a lack of the giggling that dominated the rest of the sequence, probably the worst bit of acting throughout.The only spot of any genuine human emoting on the actors part is when the parents finally take revenge for their child, their descent into madness and the resulting anguish when revenge does not bring them the satisfaction they expected. The final frame, a frozen close up on Mr. Collingwood's pained expression, is far more effective than anything that preceded it.Though "Last House" deserves kudos for it's visionary concepts (comic relief as a means of setting up scares, making the evil protagonists almost likable so that their eventual brutality is all the more devastating), particularly the push of moving the genre away from fantasy monsters like Dracula and the Mummy, to the all too close to home depths of human depravity, it never quite lives up to it's early promise.Craven gets deserved credit for the influence this would have on later horror, but all of these concepts were done better in other films(Devil's Rejects obviously drew influence from this film, among countless others), including some of the later efforts from Wes himself.4 stars , better in concept than execution</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those kooky killers!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first and hopefully last film to combine graphic torture, slapstick and kazoo music. If the characters and situation had been just a little more over the top (and the rape and torture sequences less prolonged), the film might have worked as a sick John Waters-type comedy; if the heavy handed attempts at humour had been dropped it could have been a very effective slasher film. What we have, however, is an incongruous mixture of jokes and brutality. Some of the cruelest moments are accompanied by bouncy country tunes; when the police frantically try to flag down a car so they can save the kidnapped girls they are first refused assistance by a car full of hippies who give them the finger and later by a folksy chicken farmer who is casually amused by their pleading (was the counter-culture audience meant to find all this pig baiting hilarious?) And yet, the film has its moments. The matter of fact way in which the girls are humiliated gets under your skin and stays there. Wes Craven also manages to give his bumbling, loser psychos some degree of humanity. And the final thirty kazoo-less minutes in which the parents of one of the murdered girls turn on the killers are genuinely suspenseful and disturbing.A black comedy that doesn't really work, albeit one of some interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange and full of holes, not Craven's best work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is a very strange and brutal film that exploits the dark side of human beings. There are several gruesome scenes in the film (for instance when one of the girls is forced to wet her pants. It is said that this film is in the style of Texas Chain Saw Massacre, a very weird argument since this film was made 2 years prior to Tobe Hooper's classic horror masterpiece. Sure,it has the same rural terror but to call it a TCM kind of film is not right.Last House reminded me very much to Straw Dogs made,in 1971.That film has the same idea since it is also about so called civilized people who are forced to act like animals when they are under severe threat.The booby traps set in Last House are almost a copy of the traps set in Straw Dogs and the whole fight is triggered by a rape (and a murder), also alike.But where Straw Dogs had great acting and a good story,Last House falls down.The acting is very bad and cheap and the story is full of holes and continuity faults. At one point it is midnight but it is still bright outside.There are several strange jumps in time which make it pretty hard to follow.Still,despite all its shortcomings it remains of interest.It is a film that they don't make anymore and it set off the career of Craven who would make his best film 5 years later with the incredibly scary The Hills Have Eyes,a classic in the genre of horror. Best to watch that movie.BTW: Not for the squeamish this film is...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie years ago when I was 15. I didn't scare easy but LHOTL really had me on edge. And I don't think any other movie ever made me jump up in the air, as this one did in one jolting scene.As you probably know, two teenage girls are kidnapped and tortured in the woods by a group of ex-cons. The parents of one of the girls soon take their revenge. Most of the acting seems very natural. And the inexperienced camera-work gives much of the film a cheap documentary appearance, making the events all the more real. There is some odd comic relief with two bumbling cops. Fans, myself included, often find this annoying. But I must say that when I saw it as a kid the cop scenes were a welcome break, allowing me to relax a bit.David Hess as Krug is amazing. Weasel is sleaze on two legs, and who can forget Sadie? Especially bizarre for some viewers is that the killers actually have some affection for each other. They're not simple fairy tale monsters.The scene of Mari walking into the lake is heartbreaking. They destroyed her will to live. And notice the killers are not jumping up and down in victory. They are not all that ashamed, but neither are they proud. They are empty. Some serial killers have commented that the actual murders generally did not provide the "high" they were hoping for. I actually enjoy most of the music in the movie, and especially find the opening track haunting. And there actually is some comedy to be found in parts. Notice Krug popping the little boy's balloon near the beginning. Evil personified!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "shocking" movie that was a let down....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***Spoilers contained in review*** With all the fuss surrounding "The Last House On The Left" I figured I'd better check it out. Well, while it was not a bad movie, I was terribly disappointed in the final result. Much the same with the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". I can see how both films were shocking for the time, and I guess siting here 30 years later it's easy to say I am not at all shocked by the content in either of these films. But I am not at all shocked. I guess that's a sad statement on today's society.LHOTL was a grainy, dirty movie. The characters of Krug, Weasel and Junior were slimy looking as well as being scummy people. I did find Krug to be a genuinely creepy character, but the character of Weasel came off more as a wanna-be henchman as opposed to a cold blooded maniac. The role of Junior was played rather effectively as well.As Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham say on the DVD commentary, they wanted to make a movie like no one had seen before. Back in 1972 I think they certainly accomplished that. But in the 33 years since LHOTL, it has lost a lot of it's shock value. Not to say that I condone rape, torture or any other type of abuse. I think even in movies that sometimes can be carried way too far.I couldn't help but feel that the two victims were not truly terrified. After a while it seemed they were becoming aware of their predicament, but I felt it took far too long for both of them to realize what their fate would be. It's as if they were just accepting the circumstances, even though they both tried escaping.Overall an interesting look at the darker side of humanity, but I felt that it could have used some fine tuning to make it even better.Rating: 6 out of 10</fullReview>

It was picked up recently by a local distributor and put out on region 4 DVD and even though the video quality is even less than VHS, I don't think you will get it any better than this, uncut and in widescreen. I had been waiting to see this film for years, being a fan of horror films (if you can call this a horror film it reminded me of a john waters film) I was not disappointed, given when it was made and on such a low budget, it kinda reminded me of the sort of thing a group of high school kids would make, but it was ground breaking, a little like night of the living dead was or blood feast was in the early 60's</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'd heard about this movie so much and it was all raving. I read the write up and it sounded good. So I watched it. I don't care if this was good in it's time and groundbreaking, that's terrific but someone trying to pick out a movie to watch during this day and age, who does not prefer cheap terrible low budget 70's horror flick B-movies would not enjoy this. It was shocking all right! I sat agape in disbelief at how awful the acting was, that these ugly, silly bad guys were so inconsistent in personality. One scene shows a brutal violence by these unfeeling fiends followed by these odd pensive looks of.."Hmmm... maybe we made a mistake, gee I think I feel bad." and it was not at all genuine or believable. The parents, whoever they were played by are some of the worst actors I have ever seen. Sometimes it appeared people were having a hard time remembering their lines because the timing, the flow was all choppy. Ever heard of reshooting a scene and editing?? The music was to say the least, inappropriate. The only light in this drastic darkness were the girls, the main character, Mari Collingwood was played by the only genuinely talented actor in the whole movie. If this movie broke new ground and by that led the way for other MUCH better films later to come then for that I am grateful as I am a very big horror genre fan. But that doesn't mean that it wasn't absolutely dreadful all by itself. I suggest that if you want something along the same lines but that is SO much better yet still is kind of dated, then watch "I Spit On Your Grave".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's seminal classic *Contains Spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the 2nd of October 1971, Westport Connecticut. Wes Craven began filming a low- budget shocker with producer Sean S Cunningham under the title "Night of Vengeance". That film became the cult horror classic The Last House On The Left. Last House tells the gritty story of two teenage girls who head into New York City to see a band called "Blood Lust"; they make a quick stop to try and score Grass. Things don't go to plan, they end up being abducted, raped and killed by a family of fugitive killers. This film certainly isn't for everyone! Fans of Wes Craven's mainstream work such as A Nightmare on Elm Street and The Scream movies might want to stay clear unless you're up for this! There are many different views on this film. Some see a modern classic. (Me) Others see cruel exploitation and some even see a dated cheese movie.The films strongest moments take place during the scenes in the woods, Where the two girls Mari and Phyllis are forced to strip and "make it with each other" at knife point by Krug, Weasel and Sadie. It's quite horrible to watch the first time. The rape and murders are mostly one shot, hand held and very gritty. If you don't already know the story then you'll be in for a shock because the film doesn't end there. The killers disgusted by their actions seek refuge in a near by house which turns out to be the house of the rape victim Mari! The parents discover what has happened to their daughter and want revenge. The killers meet a violent death. Death by Chain saw, fellatio castration! - One hell of a Freudian Nightmare! &amp; not forgetting suicide. It's not exactly the Christmas family movie. But to Fans of true cult horror it's Citizen Kane! Just for the record this is one of my favorite films! Along with The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Dawn of the Dead, Night of The living Dead, The Evil Dead, Suspiria, Blue Velvet, Martin, The Hills Have Eyes and many more! One other thing to note is that this movie has been cut banned in just about every country in the world. Its original running time was 92mins. The longest version now is about 84mins. This is due to the fact that cinemas, local councils, the censors, the producer etc have cut the prints so many damn times! I actually own the UK anchor bay DVD. A special 2disc set full of extras. OK it has 31seconds deleted from it but even the BBFC can't destroy the power of this picture. The US version is longer but the UK has more extras. One other thing to note he UK has an Easter egg which gives you a link to view the bbfc cuts &amp; and stills of the cuts. So there you have. The movie came out of a time of repression, War, Student Riots and censorship. Very few directors were brave enough to challenge the politics of the time. George Romero with Night of The Living Dead, Tobe Hooper with Texas Chainsaw and finally Craven with Last House. These Films are a big F**k you to right- wing middle class values! For a film that's been banned for 32 years in prim and proper Britain that's an achievement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film really shows its age...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever a movie shows its age, this is it. The film is strictly speaking a thriller, although people might be fooled into thinking it is a horror due to its association with director Wes Craven, and it's title which somehow implies something sinister (but the house actually has nothing to do with what transpires during the film).The scenes of violence are surprisingly unmoving - including rape scenes, and brutal cold-blooded executions. A chainsaw even makes an appearance. But it's all decidedly ho hum, and it shouldn't be. The terrible music doesn't help. One could also argue that the film was made in a much more conservative time, where the horror of death transpires off screen rather than in your face. There's nothing wrong with that (e.g. Blair Witch Project) - but it doesn't seem to work here. The character building scenes are also non-functional, and I found myself not caring what happened to any of the lead characters (good or bad).This film fails really to work at any level. If you were out for old school horror films from the 70's, then I suggest Dario Argento's which are truly much more disturbing than this disappointing effort from future horror maestro Wes Craven.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time today - and it will be my last. This isn't because I found it distressing, scary or disturbing. It's simply because I thought it was lame.Everyone keeps going on about how disturbing it is, but I failed to see how this can shock people in the ways that I've been told about (people being sick, people having heart attacks, people having to sleep with the light on for weeks after) - what a load of rubbish.I agree that the film wasn't very nice, but horror films generally aren't. Personally, I found that dinner scene of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre far more disturbing. I found the violence in Natural Born Killers much more distressing. To me, this film has been hyped up far too much.In reality, this film is a reasonably gory, unpleasant, yet bland kidnapping movie. You never actually see a knife enter the skin (like you do in quite a few films these days), most of the acting is laughable, and there are very few scary moments.Some of the scenes of a sexual nature are indeed unpleasant, but there are much more graphic films than that out there!I can't see why this film has been banned for as long as it has. It should have been released quite a few years ago. Actually, what am I saying? It should have been thrown away a long time ago.A very generous 6/10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimately, disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like many ?banned' films LHOTL's reputation exceeds it's actual content. The film is disturbing, the rape and torture scenes are unsettling, however the way the shots are taken leave much of the unpleasantness to the imagination, if you'd wish to imagine such things. The acting is amateurish but the result is a sense of realism that in hand helps make the torture scenes seem more realistic. The slapstick music provides an uncomfortable contrast between itself and the violence, baring a resemblance to ?A Clockwork Orange'. This isn't the film I hoped it would be, while it is a raw and unnerving piece of work it fails to get past the exploitation and create a truly scary film. A disappointing Craven film and a further sign that ?A Nightmare On Elm Street' and the first 15 minutes of 'Scream' were great more by chance than any other factor. (I am yet to see ?The Hills Have Eyes' though).5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is the BEST thing that WES CRAVEN has done!Forget all that ELM STREET/SCREAM garbage, LHOTL is the real deal...no sequel tie ins/no unfinished plots/no idiotic teens...Just hardcore Horror!! The fact that CRAVEN slips in, moments of comedy, between the nastier moments only highlights the fact that, like it or loathe it...Our parents know better! This is displayed by the early scenes, in which the young girl, MARI, is full of youthfull confidence against her parents, and any advice she is given, for her wellbeing, is totally ignored. Once the two girls find themselves in deep trouble, with KRUG and co, the movie (smartly) moves to a scene of (almost corny) family bliss. We have all been in this situation, we find our selves in trouble (maybe not to this extent) and then wish for the boring ideals of homelife, rather than danger, to wrap it's ever loving arms around us.However hip the two young girls act, it's the parents in this movie, that turn out to be the quick thinking ones. Because with age...comes experience!!DAVID HESS (as in HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK) is brilliant in this movie, contributing (what i think) are some really good (and haunting) tunes to the movies soundtrack. All performances in this above-average movie are great, especially the father (played by GAYLORD ST JAMES...great name....very camp!)Some of the violence (or implication of it) may put some people off, but the movie is certainly haunting enough, for scenes to stay with you forever. Even some of the menacing scenes, are done with a tongue in cheek manner. WEASEL is described as having previous convictions in "peeping tom-ism" and SADIE is described as "animal-like" after kicking a german shepard dog to death, during the gangs gettaway.Scenes that will stay with me are:GAYLORD ST JAMES camp looks to his wife.KRUG making one the kidnapped girls hit the other.KRUGS sudden apearence with the machete.MARI's mothers punishment on WEASEL.KRUG urging his son, junior, to "BLOW HIS BRAINS OUT" (KRUG screams this untill his son actually does this, KRUGS face imedietly turns serene, as if to say "that's my boy!")DAVID HESS's soundtrack (especially the jaunty song featured in the end credits..containing the line "PHILYSS is sucking up...son of a b-e-e-a-c-h!"A classic movie, but misunderstood by generations of MTV loving horror fans 10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very, very good but not as disturbing as hyped</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there's one thing that annoys me about Wes Craven films its how some of his best work - i.e. Serpent and the Rainbow and Last House on the Left have stickers on the covers that say "From the director of Scream". As good a film as Scream is its not horror - its a thriller. If you want to see a horror film see Texas Chainsaw Massacre, The Others, The Blair Witch Project or Last House on the Left. I always loved the concept of Last House, but unfortunately nowhere in the UK stocks it (Probably due to its ban which I think recently has been lifted). Last House is a gem of a film, its got the same old grainey feel as the Chainsaw Massacre which gives it so much more edge. These films give a feel of a time almost forgotten, and for me lure me into a feeling of helplessness because it was so long ago. People raved on and on about how this film was terribly disturbing. I disagree. The film is fairly upsetting alright, but its not the sort of thing that would leave any sane grown up unsettled after viewing - I mean, the first 15 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is nearly as disturbing as it gets. The scenes of torture in Last House are pretty horrible - but much much worse is available. The thing I did like about this flm was - well not even hat I liked it but the most effective thing was the feeling of helplessness during the first attack scene in the apartment. Its then we realise the girls will not walk out of this please, and its doom ahead. The kidnappers done a wonderful job, I mean, I really hated these people while watching the films and at the end its difficult convincing yourself that they arent bad people, they are in fact just great actors. One thing I wondered though - the torture scenes were so long and the revenge scenes were so short. I didnt like this - the film almost built us up for revenge and we didnt really get it, the baddies (especially the woman) got off fairly lightly dont u think? I mean.....for what they did? All in all though I really love this film......next to Vanilla Sky its one of the best films Ive seen this year! 7/10</fullReview>

It's kind of hokey, though there are a couple of scenes that are a little too authentic for the average moviegoer's tastes I'd think. Watching this movie, you start to wonder who was responsible for the music selection. It's like listening to early James Taylor. Rape and brutal murder scored to early James Taylor-sounding music do not a good experience make. The acting is sub-par and the low-budgetness of the entire production shines throughout. It is creepy in a Blair Witch pseudo-real way but I think the anticipation of watching this after hearing about it for so many years kind of dulled the experience for me. Don't count on being impressed. Final note: the DVD contains a lot of interesting info on the movie. Rating: ** out of *****.</fullReview>

The shock value and violence may be a little dated, but nevertheless it is disturbing. Krug and company's lack of empathy, their lack of motive ... it is chilling.The most distasteful thing about this movie is not the violence or shocking scenes (of which there is plenty of both) but the happy music that accompanies some scenes, and the 'comedy' subplot of the sheriff and deputy trying to reach the house.

		<fullReview>LHotL is one of the more disturbing movies I've seen and contains some very, very dark humor. At the same time that the young girls are getting raped, tortured, beaten, and shot, the stereotypical bumbling sheriff and his young deputy, who are attempting to arrive to find the psychotics who have broken out of prison, fall into a series of misadventures, including one with a freakishly gap-toothed black woman talking about chickens and how she can't carry the civil officers.Huh?Exactly what I was thinking. This movie contains some other strange sequences that were obviously intended for comic relief, but basically end up completely destroying some facets of the plot. Odd music is heard when Krug has sex with Sadie in the back seat of the convertible, almost a theme-song for the young, excessively violent and maniacal attackers. Sadie talks about "Sigmund Frood".The evil characters themselves are somewhat interesting when actually portrayed, but it was as though their parts were stereotypically written as tremendously evil. Krug was in jail for killing "a priest and two nuns" and his son got hooked on heroin from good ol' Pops.A particularly bizarre moment is when the parents discover their child's body and you can clearly see her eyes open, and she even moves around a little bit.But the greatest part is of course, what happens to poor Weasel.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A low budget black comedy with some shocks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start with this film. It's amateur, which can be blamed on the budget. The editing and camera work is pretty shoddy. But you don't watch the film for that, you view it with the intent on seeing the notorious scenes of torture and murder, not the side show of silly bumbling slapstick cops and poor acting. The problem with the film is the two girls. They are not convincing. They don't emit any fear. And the killers don't seem as convincing as the ones in, for example, I Spit on your Grave. Krug is the most threatening of them all. The others are a gaudy guy with a knife, a wimpish junkie, and a ditsy bimbo.It's an amazing coincidence how the killers take the girls in the trunk of their car to a desolate location, that turns out to be adjacent to one of the girls' parents' house. And the killers then later stay the night there. The parents revenge on the killers is quite amusing. I watched this film in a theatre that was well attended, and there were plenty of laughs. Some of the lines were amusingly memorable, one of the killers named Weasel saying, "I can make love with my hands tied, I'm so super." That line got a lot of laughs in the theatre. I'm not saying this is a bad film. It's one of the unusual films that can shock us (and the scenes where the girls are killed are disturbing) but also amuse us in the next scene. I compare this film with Herman Yau's The Untold Story, which is a far better film in my opinion, in the way it combines shocking violence with humour. To sum up, a shock/funny film worth watching, and it's criminal the film is still banned in the UK. It seems no worse than The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, which is now available in the UK.</fullReview>

Wes Craven's first film is interesting, but only to a horror fan-- or rather, those who enjoy the slasher films of the late 70s and 80s. Anyone else should avoid this movie, because you'll be wasting your time.The story revolves around two teenage friends, Mari and Phyllis, that run off to New York to see a concert. Unfortunately, while trying to score some drugs, the pair run into a gang of recently escaped criminals. Things go south from there... and eventually, through amazing coincidence, lead back to where the movie began-- then things start to get interesting.Before seeing this movie I had read the other comments here about the film being shocking; and up until about the last half hour, I thought most were overreacting. True, viewers are more jaded now and can handle more than they could back in 1972, but still, weaker viewers will find the climax of this film very unsettling. Things get a bit crazy that last half hour, and make the movie worth sitting through. I must admit, however, the events at the end of the film seemed a bit too coincidental and unbelievable, which took away from some of my enjoyment (but this is based on a true story?).The acting is horrible and you may sometimes wonder why you are watching this film, but, somehow, Craven keeps the film moving forward (with the possible exception of the scenes in the woods) towards its climax. Stick it out, and you'll be glad you did.Recommended for Horror fans only. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Last House on the Left is the tale of a group of kids who rape and murder two girls, only to meet their demise from the girls vengeful parents. This flick has one of the worst production values I've ever seen and I've seen some real crap. Last House is suppose to disturb and shock the viewer. Although it is merely a mediocre flick with poor acting, editing, and all around production, the word amateur comes to mind. I do however commend the finale in which the group meets a violent end, but it only shows what promise the flick could have had. Only for hard core Craven fans, but most will still be let down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the most pointless "Nasty" ever made!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard all about this classic "Video Nasty", I got hold of it on DVD. Yet, after the 81 minute run time, I was left with only one question: "Why?". Why was this labelled a "Nasty", when so little is shown, even in comparison to some modern-day horror films? Why does everyone else call it a genre classic, when it is so ineptly acted, with such a dire script and such lame effects? Well, I guess only Wes Craven and Sean Cunningham can answer those. What this movie is, is pointless, crass and simply downright pathetic. The gore is limited, and what little you can see through the "raw" photography, is obviously fake. David Hess looks less like a psychopath, and more like a slightly-mad drugged-up hippie! And the finale, is simply lame! Forget this dire movie, and let it be consigned to history forever. I can't even say that this movie has the exploitation factor, going in its favour, as there is simply nothing exceptionally exploitive that is shown, that hasn't appeared so many times before in other "Nasties"! For those of you who want to see something at least remotely plausable, and even genuinely unsettling, go for Meir Zarchi's much-reviled "I Spit On Your Grave". At least that film has the redeeming factor of being worth discussing for its pro-woman or anti-woman viewpoint! If "Last House" is so great, then why has even its director essentially disowned the movie?! A total, and unmitigating, mess!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To this day after seeing this film 14 years ago and then again recently to see if maybe I missed something I am stunned by people who hail this film as one of the greatest horror movies of all time. The film has many flaws. One is the editing which is downright awful! Parts of scenes seem to be missing. The music score is totally out of place. The rape and murder scenes are supposed to be filmed realistically but the use of happy joyful music as this happens is as offensive as anything in this film. The film goes from humor at the very beginning to attempted shock in the middle and then goes overboard to total lunacy at the end. The villains are pretty despicable but the final revenge from the parents is totally over the top. The worst scene however is the two idiot cops bumbling around while the two girls are being raped and tortured....and to that damn happy music again. A film such as Henry: Portrait of a Serial Killer takes a realistic spin on subject matter and makes it all the more horrifying but Last House on the Left tries to be realistic and funny at the same time and fails at both miserably. Not a putdown to Wes Craven as I like his scope of work but LHOTL is his all time worst in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's supposed to be a horror film, but it tries to be a drama and a comedy at the same time... and it fails</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While a lot of people seem to praise this film as a horror gem, I myself consider it more like a drama? a mildly gruesome drama, but certainly not horror. I can enjoy horror films that don't contain some of the expected traits, like: jumps, creepy music, lots of screaming or tons of gore? but there has to be something to remind us that this is, in fact, a horror movie after all. To be honest though, there is a little bit of gore, that's true? but if the atmosphere isn't reminiscent of a horror film, the gore itself ends up being out of place. I was expecting something good, as I consider Wes Craven to be a very talented horror director, but I guess he simply wasn't in his prime back then. On 'Last House on the Left', the story revolves around a group of criminals, three guys and a trashy girl, who have recently escaped from prison. Two girls on her way to a concert, decide to stop by a house, looking for marijuana. The girls are kidnapped by these ex convicts, who torture them, rape them and eventually murder them in a brutal way. After butchering the two friends, the gang seeks refuge with the parents of one of the victims, who are completely unaware of everything. However, when the man of the house finds out about what happened to his daughter and who were responsible for what happened to her, he teams up with his wife to execute a gruesome revenge against his four guests.The idea of two vindictive parents trying to avenge their dead daughter sounded promising and original for a horror film. It gives hopes for something tragic, dramatic and gruesome, but in the end, "Last House on the Left" ends up being more like a drama full of missed opportunities. One would expect a movie like this to reach its high point in the scene where the parents are finally able to avenge their daughter, but to my disappointment, this confrontation takes place only during the very last minutes of the film and it is shown in a very bland way. I can understand that minimalism works in certain films, and I don't expect all movies to offer some kind of gruesome shock value. The problem is that simplicity is not exactly something that one would expect from a film like this, where a certain amount of gruesomeness is almost mandatory. When the father finds out about what happened to his daughter, he looks completely numb. We never really get to see any signs of devastation, which would have added a well-placed share of drama to the story and would have made the last minutes much more powerful and tragic. My main problem with this film, however, is the fact that there are a few moments of pointless slapstick comedy. I mean, how can this be explained. It's supposed to be a horror film, but instead it is a horrible drama? with a few comedy moments? We see a girl getting stabbed and right after that, we see two dumb cops doing funny things for the audience to laugh. Honestly, I don't get it. I also find the banjo music to be inappropriate, as it works as a some kind comedy relief and it really doesn't make any sense in a movie like this. I am aware that sometimes, joyful music in horror movies is a way to create some kind of strong contrasting atmosphere, but in 'Last House on the Left', it simply sounded out of place. Most people seem to be impressed about the 'appalling gore' and impressive scenes, but I was mostly surprised by the lack of them. True, there are a few scenes that looked pretty brutal, but the gore is not striking enough to save the entire movie. I don't really understand what's the deal with the lame tag line that says 'To avoid fainting, keep repeating "It's only a movie...It's only a movie..."'. I didn't find any parts to be that horrifying, to be honest. Even though I don't focus on the gore very much, I must admit that there are certain horror movies that make up for the weak plot, with a nice amount of carnage... unfortunately, this film is not one of those.I give this movie 5 stars because even though I don't agree with the overhype, I still think it's a watchable drama with a few horror and comedy elements scattered around.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard a lot about this movie, I have the Nightmare on Elm Street collection on DVD and Wes talks about this movie, how it was one of his first and a great learning experience. Then my dad and mom mentioned that this was actually their first date! And how awkward it was watching this movie and how stupid it was, etc. Then on a TV show about horror flicks, this was in the top twenty. Come on! One of Wes's first(the master horror), my parents hated it, and in the top twenty of greatest horror pieces in history! How can I not watch this movie? For it's time, I can see how creepy and disturbing this was. It still is to this day, I wanted to turn it off several times, these poor teenage girls were tortured. But! The acting? It was so bad. I mean, the two teenage girls, they acted like this has happened before. While one of the Krug's begins to rape the girl, she's like "No. Stop. Oh, no." Very calmly, not panicking, or struggling. Her friend is just standing there, not trying to help her or try to escape. I understand, shock. But if that was me or my best friend, we would've done something than just stand there.The parents? At first they appear as your typical over protective conservative parents. Then they turn into horny love birds. Their daughter is missing, but they really don't seem to care. They call the police, both policemen are incompetent by the way, and that's it. They invite complete strangers, who happen to be the killers(but they don't know it), into their house and let them stay. When they discover what the killers did to their daughter, they go Texas Chainsaw Massacre on the Krugs! It's crazy.I've seen a lot of homage's though to this film. Cabin Fever, The Devil's Rejects, House of 1000 Corpses, and I spit on your grave. Over all, it's not the worst movie I've seen, but it is bad and disturbing. I'm telling parents, do not let your children watch this! For horror fans, give it a try.4/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I had seen Tlhotl. the first time, I was confused and not sure what to think about the movie. On the one hand, it seemed to be a stupid movie that enjoys violence, but on the other hand there was somehow more about it. After a week, I watched it the second time, and I slowly began to realize the genius that's behind this work. It's a low-budget movie, which tops every 50-million dollar thriller/horror-movie that exists in the way of directing, screening, acting and how it really touches the viewer, also by the sarcastic trick of putting the horrible events in contrast to a lovable, sweet blues/country-soundtrack made by genius David Hess. One argument, so many people hate the movie is its extremely realistic violence (mentally and physically) but thats kind of a weird double morality, as the movie makes quite experience-able, what violence means, and what crimes do to families. I think in a radical way, the film must be seen as a statement against violence, quite longsighted for the time it was made as nowadays we have come to a culture, in which violence and crimes, tragedy's of humans are pure consumable entertainment, a trend which (as so often bad trends do) started up in the U.S.A. and came over to Europe the last years (reality serials that "entertain" by endlessly presenting homicides and sexual crimes, using the victims families in a voyeuristic way). This trend is disgusting, and not The last house on the left !!! Thanks to Wes Craven, and his encouraged, extremely talented cast (one name: David Hess, a man that with better luck could have played the same roles like Robert De Niro) with L.h.o.t.l. the so called horror-genre (I wouldn't call it a horror movie, but its seen as one) has become one of its really view masterpieces. Its in a way pure irony, that this "worst movie of all times" can only be completely understood by consumers with a high intellect, a gore freak that doesn't want to think will probably not like it. Anyway, anyone who got strong nerves and is willing to understand this movie, should really see it, as its one of the most worth-full movies ever made !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this for the first time only a couple of days ago. Having read quite a bit on how supposedly graphic and disturbing it was, I found it to be pretty mild and, really, I cannot understand what all the fuss was about (especially when considering that the BBFC has recently failed, once more, to pass it Uncut for Anchor Bay UK's upcoming DVD).First of all, I did not find the film to be at all scary: much has been said of the film's amateurish look actually enhancing its 'realistic' approach and the unrelentingly 'intense' mood, but I thought the proceedings way too dull to have much of a lasting impact! Which makes it all the more incredible that so many (equally reviled) films were inspired by it - LAST HOUSE ON DEAD-END STREET (1973), I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978), THE HOUSE ON THE EDGE OF THE PARK (1980), etc.As for the notorious scenes of torture and bloodshed, they were too prolonged and excessive to be taken seriously. Maybe Craven's intentions were justifiable at the time - the parallels to the Vietnam War are obvious - but this eventually dates the film as, placed out of context, the extremes of 'horror' depicted feel merely sensationalistic (and none too convincing at that). Actually, the only genuinely disturbing scene (on an emotional level) is Mari's rape and its tragic aftermath - also, the fact that the murders take place very near Mari's own house is interesting, and very poignant, in itself; conversely, the preceding humiliation and gore did not have the desired effect on me - for I was left, pretty much, cold by it all! Then again, Weasel's dream sequence - which has a vaguely surreal air to it - is also notable in this respect, if all too brief.Another disagreeable aspect of the film is the virtual lack of any sympathetic characters; in fact, only the two victims emerge as likable in any way - and I'm sure the film-makers do not expect us to condemn them for their pursuit of drugs, either. Otherwise, the entire gang are portrayed as repellent scum (it's interesting how in the documentary Marc Sheffler, who plays the junkie, says that his character could still not be allowed to live - even though he had no direct participation in the crimes) and the rest of the characters (the cops, Mari's parents) as basically stupid. The scene where the gang are shown cleaning themselves up in the woods certainly doesn't draw us any nearer to them but, then, neither does the parents' wild and woolly revenge scheme! Personally, I wasn't too bothered with the two bumbling cops (again, this was a sign of the times, and cannot really be held against the film).What really mars the film, in my opinion, is the sheer implausibility of events: · it's easy to say that the gang is supposed to be depraved and criminally inclined but, as fugitives from justice, one would hardly expect them to go to such lengths (driving all the way to the woods) in order to 'get a few kicks'!· also, I couldn't make out why Mari's parents were so ready to allow the gang to stay for the night; if anything, they could have brought up their daughter's disappearance - and the fact that they were worried about her - as an excuse for turning them down!· another glaring 'oversight' arises in the parents' discovery of their daughter's body: just what made them look for her in the lake? Then again, they don't even bother with the other girl's corpse (which, probably, was not hidden to begin with)! Why don't they even think, for a minute, of alerting the police (however inefficient they might be)? Surely, they must have realized then they were faced with a desperate group of people - so, just what made them so sure they could overpower them in any way?!· the entire 'Night Of Vengeance', then, is positively ludicrous: how could so staid a couple (as Mari's parents were shown to be until that moment) conceive such a savage (and improbable) retribution, let alone have the guts to carry it through?!To see how much more subtly and compellingly the story could have been told, one need go no further than the film that supposedly inspired it: Ingmar Bergman's THE VIRGIN SPRING (1959). I have only watched it once, some three years ago, but I remember it was a very fine piece indeed - similar, in its 'medieval moodiness', to THE SEVENTH SEAL (1957) - but with a very different Max von Sydow this time around, who creates a forceful yet indelibly human figure. Interestingly, here we have a single victim and three killers (all male, one of whom is just a boy!) and, as far as I can remember, the girl's mother does not participate in the revenge. Still, von Sydow swiftly eliminates them (the boy's death is particularly memorable) - there are no long-winded chainsaw routines here and, certainly, nothing like what Mari's mother had to do in Craven's film!I watched THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT by way of a VHS copy recorded from MGM's R1 DVD; I was also given an opportunity to sample all the extras on the disc (save for the Audio Commentary), and these formed an interesting - if hardly comprehensive - overview of the film's history, in terms of both production and censorship.On a side note: the person who copied the film for me, graciously, went on to include trailers of several other 'Horror' films in his collection, none of which I had seen (the four titles in Anchor Bay's 'The Giallo Collection', THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE, JUNGLE HOLOCAUST and CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST, RE-ANIMATOR, NEAR DARK and SLEEPLESS) and which I appreciated immensely!Yesterday, I read this thread again all the way through and a couple of interesting points cropped up: that THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT is referred to as a horror film (presumably because of Craven and Sean S. Cunningham's later output), whereas something like Pasolini's SALO' (1975) - for all its revolting detail - has never been considered as such (which I would say is a pertinent argument, as that film is far more graphic and 'objectionable' than TLHOTL); also, that the film would 'work' even more were it to be read as a 'dark comedy' - and I tend to agree here because, frankly, I felt that the excessive violence had a farcical edge to it - similar, in a way (though nowhere near as accomplished), to A CLOCKWORK ORANGE and STRAW DOGS (both 1971)! Finally, I have also recently read the 'Most Disturbing Scene In A Film' thread and realized, not only how few of the films mentioned I have actually watched, but also how I'm not much into this type of film, i.e. graphic depictions of violence as a means of entertainment. I can take gore if I have to but, if that's a film's only claim for 'quality', I'll invariably - and, gladly, I might add - skip it!</fullReview>

I can see how this type of movie would appeal to a certain segment of the general mass of humanity. However I have trouble viewing it as anything more than a curiosity.

And then taking a big old hunk off.Willow just being blitzed out of it all mentally, but still knowing where it was all headed, and still going there.Keystone cops ? playing checkers ? walking and yipping at each other ? arriving just a tad too late.

That whole scene did not work.The guy by the mailbox at the very beginning set the wrong tone, and then just disappears. Sure you've got to highlight the `McGuffin' for later, but this guy detracts too much.The coup de grace with the chick in the swamp.

		<fullReview>The Last House on the Left ranks right up there with I Spit On Your Grave as one of the most disgusting, sadistic, upsetting, degrading, disturbing and stomach turning films ever made. Two girls on their way to a rock concert stop and hit up a young man for some pot. The young man, unfortunately, is just one of a gang of perverted psychopaths. He takes them upstairs and once the door closes behind them, the fate of the girls is sealed...but not before they are raped, tortured and humiliated all through the night and on into the next day. This is a very difficult movie to watch, unless you have a cast-iron stomach or are just a desensitized sociopath. I rented it at the age of 18 simply because it had been directed by my then favorite director, Wes Craven. (I was a huge fan of A Nightmare on Elm Street). I returned it as soon as it had ended, shocked and sickened by what I had just watched. This is a big fat 10 on the sadism scale, with our two young heroines forced into every despicable and degrading act by their tormentors. One is killed when she tries to make a run for it. The other, a mostly innocent virgin, is slowly raped in what was, for me anyway, the films most disgusting scene. She is then shot and left to die in the woods. Her killers make the mistake of stopping off at a nearby house, not knowing that the residents are the parents of one of the girls. The parents find out who these people are and, even worse, what they have done, and carry out a swift and brutal revenge upon the psychos. But there's no sense of justice having been done. The parents are forever scarred, not only by their daughters death but by their own descent into brutality. From a technical standpoint, I can say that this is not a BAD film. It is shot with gritty realism, feeling almost like a documentary or, worse, a snuff film. Watching it makes you feel like a dirty conspirator. The acting is pretty good, especially from the criminals who almost seem to enjoy their roles almost a little TOO much...but hey, I can't fault them for wanting to earn a paycheck. However, the screaming and crying of the two young victims was simply more than I could bear. I cannot stand sadism, and I would advise anyone who feels the same way to steer clear of this film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the movie was okay, but there were still some down parts that got me annoyed through the entire film. These were the music and the police men. Which, the only reason that i could understand their presence in this film would be to soften the blow of the images but instead they made the movie almost a joke and the by the end of the film it just felt like a really bad dental flows commercial. The images are shocking and if you look at this movie with subtitles and without the audio off, I'll bet the movie will be more shocking than what it already is. Also, the film looks very well done...for a college film. Nevertheless, taking apart all this down sides, i understood what the director wanted the message to get across, and I won't doubt that this could be the worst nightmare that any parent could have. I still think that the movie was good and the imagines will definitely stay with you for a while but I don't see any reason why a person would see this more than once. A great cult classic, but not for me.Also, If you are an over protecting parent, do not see this film but if you are going to watch it anyway, then also watch 'The Virgin Suicides' ;). The two extreme will balance your head pretty nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, so I was expecting a horror or slasher movie and I was wrong. I can partially blame that on the misleading title (the house plays virtually no part in the movie and it's not haunted) and the misleading trailer. But that's not the point. As a thriller, crime drama, or whatever the heck it was trying to be, it failed. I was simultaneously bored and rolling my eyes, dying for the film to end! Even at a little under 90 minutes, it felt like an agonizingly long journey.The violence in the film is not pretty, but didn't bother me too much. And that's its problem, it should've bothered me. The scene where the vigilantes make one of the girls pee her pants would make anybody cringe, but I felt too distant from the characters to actually feel anyone's pain. For God's sake, there's even a scene where one of the characters bites a guy's you-know-what off. I should've been grabbing my crotch, yelling "Ouch!" but there was no tension leading up the moment. The horrible score (which I can regard as one of the absolute worst in movie history) also has a lot to do with it. Instead of eerie music to help build the suspense, the most violent sequences are set to corny 70's folk songs. And after the movie's brutal ending, we're faced with a happy-go-lucky credit sequence. What kind of horror movie ends with a credit sequence like that? I can also blame the film's effortless editing, in which the comic relief is timed very poorly. After a horrific sequence, we cut to a slapstick vingette involving the two bumbling police officers. It's like watching "The Exorcist" mixed in with an episode of "The Three Stooges."Wes Craven has made some damn good films. I like the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" (not saying I don't like the sequels, but Wes didn't write and direct most of the sequels) and I enjoyed the "Scream" movies. "Last House on the Left" is no sign of Craven's future genius. It is a poorly edited, poorly photographed mess of a movie. Definitely not a timeless piece of cinema, it shows it's age like crazy. And I'm not just talking about the obvious signs like the dopey fashions and hairstyles. The footage is very grainy and the zoom-ins are shaky. As a matter of fact, the camerawork in general is very shaky.*************SPOILERS AHEAD****************The narrative is destroyed when the two sympathetic characters are killed off halfway through. By then, who do we root for? It's obvious that Craven now wants us to root for the parents, but you can't just shift the sympathy to a new duo of characters."Last House on the Left" is dull and completely lacking in suspense. Sure, the events in the film are credible and can occur in everyday life (Craven makes a good point in his commentary about in real life, people are tortured and killed without the benefit of a cutaway), but this is a film and it's supposed to tell a story. A story that'll interest an audience. Reality is everywhere. Movies are depictions of reality.However, if you do buy or rent the DVD, there's a great commentary with Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham (who later directed "Friday the 13th"). So many directors give false praise for their filmwork, and make all sorts of pretentious statements that may have been in their minds when making their films, but they don't show up on screen. There are several times where Craven actually mocks parts of the film, and admits that not all the scenes worked. He has an incredible sense of humor (interesting that a funny guy like this is directing horror movies and unfunny bore like Wes Anderson is directing comedies), and jokes about how many of the actors don't want to be associated with the film. He even makes a sarcastic statement aimed towards aspiring filmmakers, saying "Don't make something like this." It's amazing how fascinating I found the making of the film, yet the film itself is so awful. Ironic, ain't it?My score: 2 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie for the first time about a year ago and must say that I was heavily heavily disappointed. I had been lead to believe for all these years that this is one of the scariest movies of all time. Maybe you had to see it when it was initially released to appreciate the movie. I just wasn't impressed. To me the scariest aspect of the movie was the acting. It was pretty sad. Take it from a true horror fanatic....Stay away from this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a few good moments, but mostly it's bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For his debut film, Wes Craven took a powerful Ingmar Bergman masterpiece and took a giant, corn-speckled crap on it. Okay, it's not quite that bad. Bergman's The Virgin Spring lends well to an exploitation remake, and The Last House on the Left works when it's being particularly exploitative (i.e., the murder, rape and revenge scenes). Unfortunately, the film is marred by the terrible acting (okay, sort of forgivable for what is pretty much a homemade film), terrible moments of comic relief (they really needed to drop the two dopey cop characters, and that whole scene with the chicken lady) and, by far the worst offense of all, the goofy AM Gold music selection. Oh my Lord, is the music terrible and it completely destroys any tension or emotion the film might have had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just about the Alpha and Omega of modern slasher flicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As one of the grandfathers of the modern slasher film, The Last House on the Left starkly demonstrates both the power and limitations of the genre. It's hard to call it a good movie but it's definitely not one you'll easily forget, even almost 4 decades after its creation.This is a brutally simple story. 17 year old Mari Collinswood (Sandra Cassell) lives with her parents in the heavily wooded countryside. For her birthday, she decides to join a friend named Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) and see a concert in the city. After the concert, the two girls run into a gang of vicious criminals, who abuse and degrade Mari and Phyllis in just about every way imaginable. They even throw them in the trunk of their car and drive out of town to do who knows what, but the car breaks down. So the gang takes Mari and Phyllis into the woods for more torture and suffering, until they finally kill them. The gang cleans themselves up and head to the nearest house to get some help and probably to rape and murder whoever lives there. The nearest house, however, is Mari's home and when her parents discover that their strange visitors have killed their daughter, they enact a revenge that is bizarre in its own perversity.This is a depraved movie. The violence of the story isn't that graphic by today's standards, where bodies exploding in a hail of blood and bone are fairly commonplace, but the relatively restrained and uncontrived nature of these violent acts makes them even more disturbing. The Last House on the Left doesn't make a big production out of its savagery. There isn't a lot of scary music, the scenes are all brightly lit and the imagery is neither manipulative nor voyeuristic. You don't even see some of the awful things done to the girls. The only truly theatrical elements of the story are when the film deliberately contrasts the horrific things happening to Mari and Phyllis with the normal and even happy things occurring with other characters. But it is the pure ordinariness of the setting and these people that make this movie genuinely unsettling.Everything else about the film is average at best. The dialog isn't exceptional, the acting isn't that good, the basic plot is nothing special, even Wes Craven's direction is okay at best. The power of The Last House on the Left comes from its uncompromising but non-exploitive, almost non-dramatic presentation of human barbarism. Most of the slasher flicks that came after this fell back on trying to shock and thrill you like a roller coaster, but this movie just wants to horrify you. It succeeds, but in doing so it proves how small and narrow the slasher movie is as a paradigm.They did a remake of this film and I'm sure it's like the other remakes done of Craven's early work. It probably looks better, sounds better, has better acting and more graphic and disgusting violence than the original?but it's not as good and it isn't really as affecting. That's because you can only show so much depravity before you cross a line and become cartoonish. Behavior that becomes too violent and too degenerate, especially when presented with the high production values of modern film, ceases to resemble anything that has to do with human beings and becomes the equivalent of a Tom and Jerry cartoon or a Three Stooges short.In some ways, Wes Craven both created and ended the slasher movie with The Last House on the Left. He showed how compelling the genre can be, but I think time has proved that there's been very little left to do with the genre that's new or worthwhile after this film. The Last House on the Left is probably the most disgusting movie I'd ever say people need to see, because it is the simplest and most direct way to understand the slasher genre and the dynamic that has been pushing graphic movie violence ever since.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>As Many Have Said, This Is Craven's "Masterpiece"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From writer and director Wes Craven ("Nightmare on Elm Street") and producer Sean S. Cunningham ("Friday the 13th"), comes a disturbing tale set in your neighborhood. Two girls celebrating a birthday go off to attend a concert, but fall prey to a group of prison escapees. Well, I think we all know what happens when teen girls meet convicted rapists.Many people have written that this film disappointed them or that it was over-hyped. Well, maybe. But as it's my third favorite horror film (after "Re-Animator" and "Evil Dead 2" but before "The Beast Must Die!") I feel that I should explain the wonders of this film.Objections will likely fall into two categories: those who don't like the film because it's old (it's from 1972 and doesn't try to hide it) and those who watched the heavily edited VHS copy (the 82 minute rather than the 91 minute version). I can't make you like older movies and I can't help it if you watched an edited version (though, in my opinion, the edited version is still creepier than many films out there today). If you don't mind older films and you watched the uncut version, then you really do dislike the film and we need to have a sit down chat.Where this film is strong is not in the gore or nudity (though we have some of both) but in the fact that unlike every other horror film out there, this could actually happen. Much like "Slashed Dreams" with Robert Englund, though this is more horror and that is more drama. There is no scene with the "monsters" that could not happen every day in your state if someone were sick enough to do it. No aliens, ghosts, mutant powers, superhuman strength or coming back from the dead. Just people against people. And to me, that's terrifying. Because people have suffered the way the two innocent girls ("innocent" compared to the kids in most horror films) suffer in this movie.The acting is alright, too, and the music from star David Hess is great. I think some people dislike the music quite a bit (see again above, some people don't like it's from 1972). The only thing about the music I didn't like is the "bumbling cops" theme. In fact, the bumbling cops could have been toned down extremely. (Some have called this a very black comedy, I don't see it that way... though the cops make me wonder.) The other music (like "The Road Leads to Nowhere") seems to fit fine, and at least one song ended up on "The Devil's Rejects" soundtrack, as well as "Cabin Fever" so I don't stand alone in thinking the idea works.Towards the later parts with the "death house" (or as I call it, the "McAllister House") the horror elements increase. And some of it might seem far-fetched (one part to me is even a bit extreme and disgusting) but again -- this could happen in real life. The booby traps foreshadow the traps used against Freddy Krueger.The DVD is worth owning for the special features, including the featurette that has interviews with almost everyone who appeared in the film, except Sandra Cassel Peabody who played Mari Collingwood. The commentary is hilarious and a rare conversation between Sean Cunningham and Wes Craven, the men who worked on this film and went on to each create an insanely successful horror franchise. The dailies and outtakes, preserved by noted film archivist Roy Frumkes, show the extended intestine scene (where the guts were actually condoms stuffed with peanut butter and jelly, tied together).This is "a film from Lobster Enterprises", a production company that only made one other film: Sean Cunningham's 1973 bomb "Case of the Full Moon Murders". Good luck finding a copy of that!Other things aren't coming to my mind at this moment, so I'll wrap it up. See this movie. I mean, look, I gave it a perfect score! How often do I give films perfect scores? If you like horror, you need to see this, because it really set down the ground rules for modern horror films. Craven and Cunningham have careers from this film, and many other people have received inspiration. It predates both Bob Clark and John Carpenter. Seriously, check it out.</fullReview>

I was stoned out my wits one Saturday when i bought this and soon after i phoned a bud to come over and check it with me. We took some serious bong inhales and started watching. Right away i knew this was gonna ruin my high, story evolves around two teenage girls who try scoring some dope before attending a concert. They are told by a guy that he has some dope in his apartment and they follow him only to be the victim of some serial killer gang ''its a lot lamer then it sounds''Soon after they kick them in the trunk of there car and off they go on a torturing adventure. the camera work gave me an serious headache! The acting was worth a taunting laugh at the most! People say there is this notorious torturing scene? It was so lame you wont believe!Owh did i mention the music? That was the only remotely funny part of this movie some sort of banjo type of music really dumb but it was making me and my friend rolling on the floor laughing cause its so stupid. As for the ending sequence? there isn't any just another boring last 30 min. So watch it if you know nothing about what makes movies worth watching and like watching utter garbage. When it finally ended i asked my friend if he wanted to have the DVD, he kindly passed and we used the DVD as a frisbee after. One of the worst horror movies out there. As for classic one-liners... PEE YA PANTS is about as good as it gets.So please don't believe all the favorable comments posted on this movie and avoid it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Historical shmistorical, this movie is neither disturbing or shocking or good in ANY way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not been one to be effected by hype. I have a great ability to wipe the figurative "slate" clean before watching any film, despite what i have read or seen. With this film, I had read all sorts of conflicting reviews. Some claim they could barely finish the film due to its graphic nature, some claim that while being over-hyped in that area, it is still a solid film that has historical significance in film-making. I understand the parallel that the director was attempting to draw between the light-hearted nature of television juxtaposed to the violent images on the news of Vietnam. All that aside, this movie is just plain awful and doesn't deliver on any level. The acting is roundly awful. Krugs gang is not frightening, intimidating or believable in any way. The movie plods along giving you a constant feeling that you are on the verge of seeing something shocking, but it never comes. They make one of their captors pee her pants, then they make them kiss, they rape them in a poorly done scene and then shoot one of them in a swamp. This is the first rape scene i have ever scene i have ever seen that didn't stir any emotion in me. The gang seems indifferent about everything they do. I don't mean indifferent in the "Wow, these crazy bastards don't care 'bout nothing'!" way, but more in the "Do these actors know that the cameras are rolling right now?" way. It's as if the whole film is a lighting rehearsal that was filmed and released. I'm baffled that this movie has achieved any status as an important or disturbing film. I'm a big fan of cult film and am still at a loss to see the interest in this film. I strongly suggest that you do not waste any of your precious time on this tripe. It has no redeeming value what-so-ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how certain films gain the status of cult classic over the years. Sometimes, they are unrecognized little gems that upon initial viewing, went unrewarded by critics and film goers alike. Often times, they are initial offerings of directors, writers or actors, who eventually went on to bigger and better things. Sometimes, it has nothing to do with either one of those, and I sit amused and puzzled by the whole thing. In the case of Last House On The Left, we have what is famed horror director Wes Craven's first solo directorial effort. The facts are that Wes went on to bigger and better things with Nightmare on Elm Street and Scream, but there is also no doubt about the total ineptitude involved in the making of The Last House On The Left.The story is simple enough. Two teenage girls Mari(Sandra Cassel) and Phyllis (Lucy Grantham) travel into town on Mari's seventeenth birthday to attend a rock concert. While walking the streets of the city, they decide to try to buy some pot. Unfortunately, they try to make their score from a couple of escaped convicts Krug (David Hess), Fred (Fred J. Lincoln), their girlfriend Sadie (Jeramie Rain)and Krug's illegitimate son Junior (Marc Sheffler). After keeping the girls for an overnight sleepover, they pack them into the trunk of their Cadillac convertible. Then in one of the biggest coincidences no writer worth his salt would dream up, the car breaks down on a road a short ways from Mari's home, where her parents Dr. John(Gaylord St. James) and Estelle (Cynthia Carr)fret and worry about why Mari hasn't returned home yet. From this point on we are treated to scenes of torture, rape, humiliation, disembowelment, and slow drawn out executions. And that's just the starter kit, folks.Craven himself has said that this film was made for no other reason than to fill the second bill for drive-in theater owners. It shows in every cheap grainy frame, the horrendous background music, the total ineptitude of the screenplay, the torturous dialog we are subjected to, and some of the wors t plot contrivances ever devised. As if this weren't enough, they throw in two inept cops (Marshall Anker and Martin Kove)for supposed comedy relief. Drive-in patrons would have been better served if the theater owners had passed out bottles of antacid.I'm sure that Craven's film did the job that it was intended for, and in fact once the film's title was permanently changed to what it is now, the cars piled into the drive in. That's the way drive-in crowds were in those days, the more that word of mouth spread about how depraved a film was, the more one was enticed to see what the commotion was about. Either that or there was a sudden shortage of motel rooms around the drive-in circuits that year. For audiences of the 21st century however, looking for a little gore to satisfy their blood thirst, they may wonder what all the fuss was about.I'm sure die hard Craven fans will convince themselves that this is great film making with deep and dark undertones explaining man's inhumanity. In reality, it's nothing more than a lesson in how much on screen depravity one could get away with in the early seventies to satisfy theater owners wanting to pile in the Chevy's, Ford's, and Oldsmobile's. In other words, it's the kind of film that should rank in the worst films of all time anywhere. It beats Gigli and From Justin To Kelly by a country mile, and though not on the IMDB worst list it should be. Whoever said there was any justice in the world though?My Grade F</fullReview>

Obviously Wes and his cronies were out to make a movie that did nothing but shock people. Oh boy, there's creativity at it's finest! (That was sarcasm.) No real thought in this movie at all.

		<shortDescription>One Of The Greatest Horror Films Ever Made. An Excellent,Powerful,Disturbing Horror Classic From Wes Craven.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Last House On The Left is one of the greatest Horror films ever made,an excellent,powerful and disturbing film that combines fine direction,a good cast and a memorable soundtrack. All of those elements make The Last House On The Left a Horror classic that is Wes Craven at his best.The Last House On The Left tells the story of Mari(Sandra Cassell),a teenager who's celebrating her 17th birthday by going to a rock concert with her friend Phyllis(Lucy Grantham)in New York City. While in the city Mari and Phyllis are looking to score some marijuana but get kidnapped by escaped convicts led by Krug(David Hess)which lead up to terrifying results.Released in 1972,The Last House On The Left is a brilliant Horror film that not only marked the directorial debut of director and Horror master Wes Craven but is also one of the most controversial and infamous Horror movies ever made. Disturbing,brutal and sadistic all around,The Last House On The Left is film that caused a stir the minute it opened in movie theaters in 1972 thanks to it's now famous movie poster and trailer tag-line("to avoid fainting keep repeating it's only a movie,only a movie")or the violent nature and was even banned in several countries and no matter what it will always seem to divide critics and audiences some will love or hate it some will see it as a Horror classic or a piece of trash there seems to be no middle ground. Regardless how you feel about the movie The Last House On The Left is up there with Night Of The Living Dead(1968)and The Texas Chainsaw Massacre(1974)in giving audiences a different kind of Horror movie and is one of the finest Horror films of the 1970s that you will never ever forget and if A Nightmare On Elm Street(1984)and Scream(1996)are Wes Craven's most famous films then The Last House On The Left is his most notorious. With The Last House On The Left Wes Craven has crafted a movie(which was made on a low budget of just 87,000$)that's rough around the edges and is an exploitation movie to the hilt but is a film with a raw and striking power that punches viewers in the gut with fright and terror that just comes off the screen at viewers. With Last House we given a movie that isn't easy to watch but is gripping from beginning to end and offers no salvation or positive outcome and while the film isn't scary Last House is a disturbing and unflinching look at violence,murder and pure evil. The atmosphere and tone in Last House is grim and bleak with a style that is sleazy,ugly and morally corrupt with a documentary feel as if you right there watching all the horrific things going on which makes the film feel realistic. Last House also gives viewers a look at the tone and feel of late 1960s early 70s Nixon era:Vietnam,The Manson Family Murders,Hippies,The Watergate Scandal and the violence during those times told in an angry and violent way. And speaking of the violence,in Last House the violence in the film is not for the weak at heart or people with can't stand violence because the violent scenes are mean spirited and vicious showing human beings at their most horrific. Craven would bring the same darkness and brutality to his later films such as A Nightmare On Elm Street and Scream but it all started here but make no mistake about it Last House is not a Slasher film. I guess that's why Last House has some Comedic scenes before,during and after the violence scenes to lighten the mood. The main characters in the film whether it's the bad guys or other main characters are actually interesting and well-developed with memorable lines and scenes. The ending of The Last House On The Left is amazing,effective and goes along with the theme of violence throughout the whole movie. A great conclusion.The cast is great. Sandra Cassell is fantastic and believable as Mari,with Cassell bringing depth to the role. Lucy Grantham is wonderful as Phyllis,Mari's friend. David Hess is excellent,frightening and unforgettable as Krug,who in my opinion is one of the greatest villains of all-time. Fred Lincoln is great as Weasel,Krug's right hand man. Jeramie Rain is incredible as Sadie,the lone woman in Krug's group. Marc Sheffler does a fine job as Junior,Krug's drug addicted son. Richard Towers(as Gaylord St. James)and Cynthia Carr do good job as John and Estelle Collingwood,Mari,parents. Marshall Anker(Sheriff)and Martin Kove(Deputy)are funny as local lawman.The direction by Wes Craven is good,with Craven basically pointing and shooting bringing a documentary look to the film and keeping the film moving at a solid pace. Fine direction,Craven,RIP.The score by David Hess is terrific,offbeat,haunting and fits with the tone and mood of the film. Great score,Hess.In final word,if you love Wes Craven or Horror films,I highly suggest you see The Last House On The Left,an excellent,disturbing and unforgettable Horror classic that you will never forget. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A pair of teenage girls are headed to a rock concert for one's birthday. While trying to score marijuana in the city, the girls are kidnapped by a gang of psychotic convicts. On the eve of her seventeenth birthday, Mari Collingwood tells her parents that she is going to the concert of underground band Bloodlust in New York with her friend Phyllis Stone. She borrows the family's car and heads with her friend to a dangerous neighborhood in the city. Meanwhile, the sadistic and cruel escapees Krug Stillo and Fred 'Weasel' Podowski are hidden in a hideout with their partners Sadie (Jeramie Rain) and Krug's addicted son Junior Stillo (Marc Sheffler) after killing two guards and one shepherd in their runaway. The two girls seek marijuana near the theater and meet Junior that offers some Colombian grass to them. They go to his apartment and are subdued by the criminals that rape Phyllis. On the next morning, they hide the girls in the trunk of their convertible and head to Canada. However, they have a problem with the car's rod and they stop on the road close to Mari's house. When Phyllis tries to escape, the gang stabs her to death and shots Mari after. Roger Ebert wrote ""Last House on the Left" is a tough, bitter little sleeper of a movie that's about four times as good as you'd expect. There is a moment of such sheer and unexpected terror that it beats anything in the heart-in-the- mouth line since Alan Arkin jumped out of the darkness at Audrey Hepburn in "Wait Until Dark."" Last House on the Left is a disturbing but ultimately it is a remarkable achievement in the horror genre.</fullReview>

The girls are forced to pee their pants then they are forced to strip down and have sex with each other then when 1 of them runs, she is hunted down and stabbed numerous times and her guts and intestines are pulled out and shown to her before her limbs are hacked off with a machete. While that happens the other girl is being butt raped by the guy and when that is over the people who killed her friend get back and she asks them if her friend got away and they start throwing pieces of her friend at her.WOW! I had to turn this off because i was watching it at night and it scared the crap out of me. also grossed me out pretty good.Yes, this film is very sick and disturbing. but that is what horror movies are about and that is what this film has mastered.10 out of 10 It's very gritty, very nasty, very gory and very darkly artistic.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let's not mince words here, Last House On The Left is shocking, hard to watch, and one of the few films that earns every bit of its infamy. This movie is less a piece of escapist entertainment than a ruthless assault on the viewer that will severely test even the most seasoned horror fan with its bleak, misanthropic exploration of the darkest recesses of humanity, its sickening displays of brutality, and its unflinching realism. Even those who giggle with fiendish glee when presented with over-the-top splatter set-pieces (I'm not judging you; you're among friends) will find it extremely difficult to stomach the deluge of horrific scenarios that arise throughout the film, and I'll even go a step further and recommend that if you do have a smile on your face when you finish watching this film, you should probably seek professional counseling.Of course, everything I've just stated about this film is precisely what makes Last House mandatory viewing for anyone who considers themselves even a casual fan of the genre.Though often categorized as an example of grind-house exploitation at its finest, Last House actually bears little thematic resemblance to anything in that canon. Whereas exploitation films are generally meant to entertain their audience, Last House On The Left seems more interested in making its viewers uncomfortable by presenting a series of atrocities that force the audience to question why deeds so horrendous would ever be construed as entertaining, and to turn a mirror toward ourselves as we wonder why it is we cannot look away. There is nothing exploitative about the inherent maliciousness of the violent acts in this film; this isn't entertainment, this is an example of just how ugly violence truly is.The plot is simple enough: a pack of loathsome killers kidnap two young girls and put them through a gauntlet of torture, humiliation, degradation, and eventually murder. When the homicidal group seeks shelter, they inadvertently find themselves in the house belonging to the parents of one of the girls they've killed. When the parents discover what their house guests truly are, and what they've done, they get revenge on the killers via a series of horrifying acts that rival anything we've seen our villains undertake.Nothing new here, just a simple revenge plot whose origins can be traced back as far as Shakespeare (or The Bible, if you want to get technical). It's what Wes Craven does with this sparse plot thread that makes Last House such a unique and disturbing film.The primitive camera equipment available to this budding auteur adds immeasurably to the presentation, and Last House more resembles a documentary than a Hollywood offering. This heightens the realism of the vile deeds we see carried out, and serves as a haunting reminder that there are actually people as twisted as Krug and Company among us, and that the terrible things we see in the film happen far more often that we like to think about.Craven also solicits unnervingly spot-on performances from his cast of unknown actors, each of whom essay their roles perfectly. As our central antagonist, it isn't surprising that David Hess's Krug is one of the film's focal points. What is surprising is how strong Hess's portrayal is. It must be maddening for Hess to forever face the existential quandary borne from the precision of his performance: Krug is brought to vivid and menacing life in a way that clearly displays that the actor playing him has serious chops, yet the role is so well captured that it would be impossible to picture Hess playing anyone else but Krug. To have one's career made and ruined with the same movie must be a nightmare, but Hess can sleep soundly knowing that even if Last House were the only film on his resume, he's made an indelible mark.It's worth noting that Craven's handling of the rape scenes in the film are remarkably restrained. Unlike the thematically similar I Spit On Your Grave, which seems to revel in its misogynistic undercurrent by making sure that we see every step of the sexual violence, Last House is far more effective because of what it doesn't show. The use of sound during the first rape scene and the heart-wrenching close-up on Sandra Cassell's face when she endures Krug's assault later in the film tell us volumes more than the 45 minute barrage of nudity and brutality that anchors ISOYG. There is nothing gratuitous on display here, and even Cynthia Carr's notorious fellatio dentana scene during the climax is more squirm-inducing because of a clever camera angle that makes us think we're seeing more than we are.Certainly, the film has flaws. The editing is spotty at times, and some important elements in the film are left beyond our understanding (how exactly do the parents stumble across their daughter's body?). The comic relief segments with the sheriff and his deputy are simply awful, and instead of relieving the tension as intended, these scenes pad the running time with pointless filler that slightly dulls the impact of the gruesome activities that comprise the core of the film.But, notice I said "slightly". There's no getting away from the fact that Last House On The Left is one of the most powerful films ever made. Despite its glaring flaws, this is a stunning debut from a director who would go on to define and redefine the horror genre at least twice in his career. Yes, it's uncomfortable to watch. Yes, it's sick and morally abominate. But isn't "horror" supposed to horrify us? Last House On The Left does this in ways that no ever film has, and in ways that will be impossible to get out of your head no matter how many times you repeat, "It's Only A Movie... It's Only A Movie... It's Only A Movie..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original version of The Last House on the Left it still effective in the first hour before almost going downhill after that</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While I had previously watched this movie on YouTube, that site had a couple of 10-minute segments cut out. I finally watched those missing 20 minutes after I just bought the unrated version from last year. To tell the truth, while what was shown was disturbing, they weren't completely shocking. What was shocking was the silent never-before-seen footage on the extras where you see complete nudity and sex acts that apparently were cut before the original theatrical release. Anyway, seeing Mari (Sandra Cassell) and Phylis (Lucy Grantham) violated like that were the most effective scenes of this now-iconic film. Certainly the behaviors of the criminal gang of Weasel (Fred Lincoln), Sadie (Jeramie Rain), Junior (Marc Sheffler), and especially, Krug (David Hess), are depraved beyond repair though Junior tries to act a little responsible but father Krug just steers him wrong every time. And Mari's parents-Dr. and Mrs. Collingwood (Gaylord St. James and Cynthia Carr) sure don't waste time for revenge though some of those scenes, especially the one where Weasel gets "his" from the mother, seem a bit over-the-top for such a more realistic depiction early on of torture and death (though of course that doesn't mean one won't get a cathartic thrill of said scenes). Obviously, writer and director Wes Craven wanted some light relief as evidenced by some of the cheery banjo songs (provided by David Hess himself) and the comic antics of the sheriff (Marshall Anker) and his deputy son (Martin Kove, later known for his roles on "Cagney and Lacey" and The Karate Kid). I liked some of that music but didn't find any of the police antics funny. Still, The Last House on the Left is a fascinating movie for the still effective torture scenes, for what the early '70s were like culturally, and for what Wes Craven and producer Sean S. Cunningham had achieved before their more popular films (A Nightmare on Elm Street and Friday the 13th, respectively) came to being.</fullReview>

It is just a typical grindhouse horror film with some really twisted characters.Craven took out all the religious overtones of The Virgin Spring, but left the forest and the water and some long scenes of nature. That is where the similarity end.Yes, it involves a young virgin that is raped and killed, and, yes the murderous "family" ends up at the girl's house, but then comes the hammer &amp; chisel, the chainsaw, the electrified door, a knife, and a blow job that you really don't want to have.Add two policemen that were as dumb as the criminals, and you had some comedy along with your mayhem.Those who found this to be the most disturbing film they have ever seen need to watch I Spit on Your Grave.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as Disturbing by 2007's standards....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last House on the Left by Wes Craven was not disturbing by modern standards,although it must have been in 1972. Too many wars and mass murders have happened, in fact too many horror movies, have desensitized me to the cheap special effects employed in this film. Granted that the death scenes for the two main characters are beautifully acted and convincingly portrayed; the felon crew are hedonistic and ephemeral, darker versions of the lost boys who feel empowered and gratified by the power evil itself can bestow on its followers. Or for that matter,the madness that clouds the mind when we indulge our fantasies, however vile and wicked, and become addicted to the pursuit of our own pleasure at the expense of our fellow humans. More shocking is the methodical revenge planned by Mari's parents, including the infamous genitalia mutilation scene in which one felon member is attacked in retaliation for Mari's murder. The actions of Mari's parents remind us that the greatest temptation of evil lies in avenging the wrongs that have been done with us, and losing ourselves as it were, to the Devil's ultimate temptation: an eye for an eye, one evil in return for another.While the movie's greatest strength lies in its frank portrayal of the thin line between innocence and experience, between sexual liberty and psychotic hedonistic fantasy, it has been far outclassed by films such as High Tension, Funny Games, and Hostel II. It seems Hollywood plays up on the brutalization of girls and women by psychotic men (and psychotic women) and one wonders if this is, in some way, encouraging the Ted Bundys of the world. I've seen more blood and guts in Dario Argento's Suspiria and The Card Player. Perhaps in 1972 this was a shocker, but not so today. Hostel II is ripe with women's victimization; one girl is mutilated with a chainsaw, another hung upside down and carved into pieces. I've come to see the murderers in Last House as a group of fallen lost boys, who choose to empower themselves by doing evil and become lost in the dark hedonistic obsessions they indulge in. Instead of offering innocent pleasure, fraternity and happiness, they inflict misery and anguish and deify themselves as the masters of life and death who can inflict rape and murder at a whim. The felon crew is an example suggesting that the road to evil begins when one isolates oneself from human morality. They contrast with the emerging sexuality of the young girls, who while no longer innocent children, remain untainted by evil's embrace. We were always preoccupied with our Dark side and the implications of a fall from grace, not only in a Judeo-Christian sense, but in an evolutionary one. A primitive band of humans, who could not be expected to understand murder and the implications of evil, evolved into an allegedly civilized race, the difference being we left the good old cave and traded it for Manhattan or at one time, Ancient Rome. I think Nathaniel Hawthorne's "Young Goodman Brown" is a prime example of this. Primitive humans did unspeakable things, like cannibalism and human sacrifice, for both ritual needs and, at times, personal gratification. Joseph Conrad, in Heart of Darkness, suggested that the primitive man can be forgiven his crimes because he is primitive and does not 'know better'. For the early man, morality does not exist. Surely he came to know the horror of his deeds, but primitive man could not be expected to realize that evil is not the true nature of the world.I think we sometimes forget that horror is a mirror, a simulation of our darker selves and the forces that drive us to bond with our Shadow. It shows that for all our vaunted goodness and civility, we still function on that primitive social level. The difference being we are expected to know better because we ought to have a better understanding of morality and compassion. This movie, Last House on the Left, like any other horror, reminds us of our Shadow's presence and that it cannot be ignored or fully understood. He dwells inside each one of us.On the other hand, horror can still be great fun. It can make us laugh at our own frailty, or shock us at our own cruelties. It is a great moneymaker. However, it is still powerful and disturbing material. What is has to present is not easily digested, hence not particularly "user friendly". Horror is great when you have a clear conscience and a talent or ability to know instinctively that is only a simulation of a false reality. If you can't do that, you'd best find another entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been hearing about this film for years, and it had been sitting in my collection for a while, so I decided to break down and prepare myself to watch it. The trailer is a Horror Legend, be sure not to skip it. The movie is not terribly exceptional. Sure it was uncomfortable at times (mostly due to early 1970's hygiene), some brutal degradation, rough themes, but all in all by today's standards for horror (or the news)quite tame. The cheery music and bizarre sound effects were era appropriately eerie, but seem comical today. The"brutal" assault(s) scenes may not have even received an "R" rating today, nothing compared to a CSI episode or the likes. Ground breaking at the time, and a great era piece, nothing more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible first half....Pretty good Last half.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has horrible acting, it's cut poorly, and several scenes don't make sense. But the last half of the movie is uniquely creepy.Horrible Acting: Almost all of the performances are just plain bad. I've seen plenty of low budget horror movies with good acting so that is no excuse.Cut Poorly: There are several parts of the movie that should have been cut. There are three separate mentions to "The phone is working now, glad you're phone is working now" Without any back story to the phone ever not working in the first place.Also one of the scenes where a girl get stabs they cut back and suddenly she's in the middle of the woods by a tree... just a bad cut.Bad pacing: The first half of the movie builds NO atmosphere or creepiness. They keep cutting to doofy music. After a brutal rape and murder (that was acted so poorly didn't seem very brutal at all) they cut to some comedic goofy scene of two cops trying to ride in a truck full of chickens... talk about killing any sort of atmosphere.The last half: The last half of the movie actually gets better. The killers are staying with the parents of one of their victims. From this point on they atmosphere starts to build and it gets fairly creepy. They stop cutting to doofy music and it's actually pretty good.Overall it's a great idea for a movie. This is one that should be re-made with better actors and a better editor. I'd only recommend it for horror fans that are digging deep to find horror</fullReview>

This work, however, seems not to be a horror film but an excessive portrayal of sickness and violence. It is a serious film of depravity which, if not art, should obviously be labeled as pornography. However, this is a fine line and I am not prepared to say which it is.I can say I was truly disgusted watching the scenes in this movie. This is obviously Craven's intent, and he has met his goal better than any other I know of. The problem is, I don't really like to be disgusted or sickened. Watching brutal murders and senseless violence should not appeal to anyone. If the film is art, it is art in the sense that it explores the deeper parts of the human psyche.ZooTrouble</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Barely a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shocking film on many levels. Yes, there's the violence, the sadism and the indifference with which the majority of the 'action' is shot. But it's also shocking for its sheer ineptitude by a director who would improve considerably for his later releases (Hills Have Eyes, A Nightmare on Elm Street &amp; Scream most notably).The amateur performances by the leads -David Hess' Krug a notable exception- to the intrusive folk jangles of Hess' strumming jar uncomfortably with the broad comedy pairing of the cops in pursuit. The heroine victims manage to elicit the sympathy deserved of such characters in their situation ? something of a miracle given the sub-standard acting involved.The unpleasant casual nature of the torture inflicted is perhaps where the film becomes less than bearable and it was at this point I began to wonder quite why I had been so keen to view it. Certainly on a film such as the superlative Texas Chainsaw Massacre there is satisfaction beyond the torture; there is an expert behind the camera and tension raised in sympathy for the lead. Last House has a camera clumsily pointed at violence for its own sake. Even bitterer is the pill to swallow that the film-makers were less than generous to the cast members playing the victims. Apparently the girl playing Mari was deliberately frightened on set by her fellow actors.A remake of a Bergman it may be but this film has no truck with art. Unpleasant and unnecessary, I don't begrudge it existing but I won't be back again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's first horror film and if I might add one of his best.Two innocent teenage girls set out for the city to see a rock concert and come across a gang of killers wanted by the police.As the hours pass,they are succumbed to torture,rape and then finally killed.The killers didn't really scare me as much as they were suppose to but the rape and torture scenes did.I can imagine what real rape victims go through.Very disturbing but overall very realistic with the viewer hoping that the girls manage to break free from their torturers.The songs were great and cheerful and a good contrast to the sadistic nature of the film (written and composed by David Hess-one of the killer gang).The acting by Mary's mum and dad were a bit cheesy and unconvincing. The killers were all very good and the only female had a tough role to play- I am sure she got a few hate mails being a woman!!I would recommend this film to all horror fanatics as it is a very early stage of horror films with the context being very modern.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wes Craven's written &amp; directorial debut is amateurish at best. You can definitely see the potential in Craven by watching this early work, however; the movie as a whole is marred by time. While this film may have been quite the shocker back in it's day, a second viewing at this point in time doesn't really deliver the chills and thrills that it did back when it was released.Two young girls go to a concert, and in returning home decide to try and score themselves a little weed. They approach a man who leads them to an apartment upstairs. Once inside, they quickly realize they have made a big mistake. 3 escaped convicts (2 men and 1 woman) are waiting for them with sadistic glee. The girls are forced in the trunk and driven out to the woods, where they are forced to pee their pants, strip, &amp; make-out with each other. Then they are raped all while the convicts laugh gleefully and perversely. An attempt to escape the confines of there attackers proves fatal.Our villains need a place to shack up, and it just so happens that the last house on the left belongs to the one of the girls parents, who have been anxiously awaiting their daughters safe return. After feeding and housing the killers, the parents soon discover that these 4 people have done away with there daughter.So what do they do?..they booby trap the house, and momma performs fellatio on one of the attackers while his hands are tied behind his back before biting of his yin-yang.The whole thing is kind of silly, far fetched, and unbelievable. If you like watching the beginning efforts of today's most successful directors, then "Last House on the Left" is worth a viewing.Just don't expect to be blown away (no pun intended LOL) by it.By today's standards, it' succeeds as more of a history lesson of early horror than anything else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The answer is "probably not"...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One previous comment I just read asks the proverbial question of whether anyone would care about this film if it had not been banned by several classification boards. The Australian answer to the MPAA, known as the Office of Film and Literature Classification, requires that any film be classified in order to be legally exhibited within Australia's shores. When The Last House On The Left was submitted for classification, it was met with a flat refusal, which essentially translates into a banning in simple terms. It has only been in recent years that Last House On The Left has been available for the Australian public to see, and it confirms my opinion that banning is one of the biggest favours a classification board can do a bad drama film.At its heart, Last House On The Left is a story about a bunch of escaped lunatics who abduct, rape, and kill two teenage girls who are on their way to a concert or something along those lines. Regardless of what these girls are doing, they never get there, as the villains proceed to put them through a gruesome execution. For sheer brutality, this film was upstaged by I Spit On Your Grave, but Last House has the distinct advantage of having likable victim characters. Indeed, the moment when one of the teenage girls is killed after seeming to resign and accept her fate is probably one of the saddest things I've seen depicted in celluloid. It is this scene on its own that earns the film much of its five out of ten rating.The weaknesses of this film are numerous. I don't know where director Wes Craven found the acting talent for this project, but it was clearly amateur night. No, let me scratch that. People say that the acting is poor in the original Nightmare On Elm Street. The performances of the cast in The Last House On The Left will make one wonder why Heather Langenkamp, Ronee Blakley and Amanda Wyss have yet to win Oscars. Keep your eyes open for a cameo from Jonathan Craven as the boy with the balloon, though. He also makes an appearance, albeit in a much different form, in Shocker. He is probably the best actor in this whole ordeal.And that is basically what Last House On The Left is. An ordeal. Every scene is stretched out past its welcome, every scene seems distended in order to stretch out the running time. What this film needed, in this writer's humble opinion, was a few redrafts in order to find something more substantial to fill out the running time. Not that this is totally without merit. Day Of The Woman, aka I Spit On Your Grave, uses exactly the same technique to pad out its running time to all of a hundred minutes. During that time, one begins to honestly wonder if this damned rape scene is ever going to end. At least Wes Craven has the insight to understand that only the most sadistic portion of his audience is going to want to watch more than ten minutes of such cruelty. At least Craven shows a good sense of time economy here, which is more than what I can say for certain directors who are more revered than they deserve.In all, this is a fairly passable early effort from Wes Craven. He shows that he knows how to elicit sympathy for certain characters, and he knows how to build a sense of tragedy. It would not be until later, during such efforts as A Nightmare On Elm Street that he would find the focus and awareness to make truly compelling viewing. This is a five out of ten film in this jaded viewer's eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven can and HAS done better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Krug (David Hess in a career making role) and his psycho henchmen (including future porn director Fred Lincoln), rape and murder two young women before stowing away at one of the murdered girl's parent's house. Sure Wes Craven's first movie isn't as somber as 1975's "Night Train Murders", due to the unneeded 'comedy' of the Keystone cop routine, nor as depraved as the infamous "I Spit on your Grave". The film warrants kudos for pre-dating those two aforementioned films, yet at the same time of the three, this movie has seemed to have dated the worst. Plus I loathe folksy music.My Grade: C- Eye Candy: Sandra Cassel and Lucy Granthem both show the three B's, meanwhile Jeramie Rain flashes one solitary nipple for a second, a far cry from what you see of her in the same year's "The Abductors" DVD Extras: Both widescreen and fullscreen versions of the film; Introduction by Wes Craven; movie commentary by Craven and Sean S. Cunningham; outtakes and dailies; Forbidden Footage; 'It's only a movie: the Making of last house on the Left' featurette; and theatrical trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't waste your money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After all the hype this received on its DVD release, I can't believe how amateurish it is. Not in the least bit scary. Not in the least bit funny. Just mind-numbingly tedious. The acting is so appalling that you don't have any empathy for any of the characters. They all look so bored and don't seem to understand what they are meant to be doing. There are even parts where they actually seem to forget or stumble over their lines. Some of the scenes look like outtakes. The musical score is also dire and weirdly inappropriate. The cinematography is pedestrian and uninspiring.What kind of movie is it supposed to be anyway? Horror? Thriller? Comedy?Porn? To be honest, it bears most of the trademarks of the latter.The entire notoriety of this film is in one distasteful, drawn out and lethargically acted rape scene which I simply can't imagine anyone (other than a would-be-serial-killer) watching more than once. This is the [i]money shot[/i] folks - you'll either be titillated or disgusted. If you're titillated (really? you sicko), then this is the only scene you'll ever bother re-watching, so you've wasted your money; if (like me) you were simply disgusted, you'll never watch this movie again, so you've wasted your money. Either way you'll be trying (and failing) to shift this on eBay before long.Apparently: "To avoid fainting, keep repeating "It's only a movie...It's only a movie...". Oh, very funny. I guarantee that there will not be a single second in which you forget that this is only a (very bad) movie.Even if you're the kind of person who simply likes to collect famous directors' first releases (like me), or are just simply intrigued avoid this one - you won't be missing anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very disappointing so-called thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two girl head out to the city, but are kidnapped by a group of criminals who proceed to toture, rape, and finally murder them. But that isn't the end to this story. A very poorly directed, acted, written (except two really ironic twists), photographed, scored, and especially edited film. It also happens to cruel, sadistic, and dumb and unbelieveble, especially in the second half and at the end where there is plenty of unintentional humor. It does contain a minimum amount of suspense during the first chase sequence, and the twist are pretty good, but still fall into the catagory of being unbelieveble. This also happens to rip-off the film The Virgin Spring, a much better film, and the only reason it is remembered to this very day is because of the talent behind the camera, even though they displayed very little here. My rating: 3 out of 10. Don't say I didn't warn you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing? Yes, but only for how awful it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't get it. This is hailed as terrifying and disturbing film-making? The direction is beyond redemption with long, boring montages and scenes featuring cake baking (why is this interesting?), shots of trees and rivers a la The Discovery Channel, cars driving down winding roads, and characters running through the woods. Take out all of those and you have maybe a half hour of action tops.I can see what Craven was going for with the actual story, but he botches it on so many levels that it never comes close to accomplishing its goal. At every point where the movie seems to be headed into a dark, unsettling place, the mood is instantly killed by music choices that undermine entire scenes, or startling shifts to "comedy" attempts by the sheriffs.Overall the whole thing comes off campy more than anything else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not an iota of suspense or tention in this overrated turd from the early 70s. Whats REALLY funny is how years after its release Wes Craven tried to say he was actually remaking Ingemar Bergman's "The Virgin Spring"! HA! The plot--2 girls get hooked up with the wrong crowd, a sick family of 3, who then rape, torture &amp; murder them. The family ends up at the house of one of the girls &amp; are summarily &amp; predictably eliminated. Then end. Upon its initial release it touched a nerve as the Manson Family exploits were still fresh in the public psyche. Viewed today its just one more example that "The Hills Have Eyes" &amp; the first "Nightmare on Elm Street" were flukes &amp; that Wes Craven is a talentless hack.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know those horror movies that aren't scary but are so horrible, they're fun to watch? Like "Slumber Party Massacre 2." Well, this isn't one of them. Utterly the worst movie ever created. Not only is it not even remotely frightening, but the plot doesn't seem to go anywhere! The entire story could have been told in fifteen minutes, but for some reason they tried to drag it out to an hour and a half. And I think the choice of music for the soundtrack is supposed to be eerily ironic, but it just adds to the stupidness of this film.Why is it called "Last House on the Left" anyway? There's no allusion of a house on the left at anytime. The only cool thing about this movie is its title. Too bad it doesn't have anything to do with the movie, though. Disappointing for a Wes Craven film. Trust me-- from a guy who always seems to enjoy a movie in some way, don't rent this piece of junk. You're better off with the direct-to-video bad horror "Uncle Sam." At least it's got Isaac Hayes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horribly Sadistic Film That Stays With You Forever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was searching for an online movie to watch and found the trailer for Last House on the Left. It brought back terrible memories of the time I saw it. Two male friends and I were looking for something to do when we were in high school - and ended up just going to the local drive in theater. We didn't know or care what was playing. It just happened to be Last House on the Left. I sat in the front seat in between my two male friends. The movie was watch-able at first. We laughed at the poor acting and storyline. We had no idea what we had in store for use. The final 45 minutes was one of the most sadistic and de-humanizing movie I have ever seen. Even the two high school senior boys on either side on me groaned in horror and psychic disturbance. I have no idea why people like Wes Craven has a need to use the film medium to act out their own sadistic tendencies - leaving lasting nausea and nightmare=producing images with their viewers. To this day, if someone asks the worst movie I have ever seen, I always state Last House on the Left - I wish someone would burn all of its copies. Do not see this movie!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pseudo-intellectual Review: What is Art?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pseudo-intellectual reviews do not hide the fact that this one of the trashiest, ill conceived, inept, 5th rate pieces of junk ever made. How anyone can find this childish rubbish 'disturbing', 'haunting' or 'shocking' is an anathema. This flick is poorly directed, poorly edited, there is no pacing and the music is a joke. There are no hidden meanings, it is not a astute comment on society and it is most certainly not a masterpiece as some deluded reviewers have suggested. This is basically Wes Carven learning how to make a movie and I am pretty sure that even he would find it hard to name any of its merits.As for the downright awful acting, I have seen more convincing performances and better dialogue in porn movies from the same period. How this film can be regarded as anything other than a cheap exploitation flick is astounding. I don't know what I find more deplorable, the movie itself or the people who actually believe it to be a work of Art. Well some people thought Tarantino's 'Death Proof' was a masterpiece so I suppose it reasons that if you put sh*t on display someone is bound to call it Art.</fullReview>

It's kind of like a comedy thats not funny and horror movie thats not scary. Long pointless scenes link with bad acting and poor writing to create one of the most boring, pointless and aggravating films I've ever seen. And I've seen some bad movies (Dawn of the Dead 2). Wes Craven is such a hack that I can't believe anyone thinks he is a horror icon. The tag line is "To avoid fainting just keep repeating, it's only a movie" But it's not a movie, it's a piece of crap. I'm only ranting because I just wasted 2 hours waiting for something vaguely interesting to happen in this movie. Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is absolutely nothing of value and nothing at all positive about Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left". When I refer to positive, I am talking quality of film making. This film is the accumulation of feces and urine that you find in a neglected highway rest stop public toilet. A person who finds this film entertaining, even as a horror film, drinks from that toilet and considers the water sweet. One definition of art is "the human effort to imitate... the work of nature." So I suppose it can be said with some technical accuracy, as disappointing as it is, that this film's attempt to realistically mimic abominable sadism is art, just as an oil painting of that highway rest stop toilet is art.Marri (Sandra Cassel) is a 17 year girl who sets out with her friend Lucy (Phyllis Stone) for a rock concert. They decide to attempt to find a little "grass" before the concert and are tricked into accompanying a young man (Marc Sheffler) who promises good "Columbian", but instead leads them to the hideout of three fugitives. The girls are abducted at knife point and taken out into the woods where they graphically humiliated, tortured, and murdered. As a poor attempt by Craven at irony, these acts occur near Mari's home where her parents are frantic about their missing daughter. At first, Mari's parents offer hospitality to the four criminals when they come to their home seeking help, but when Mari's mother and father learn their daughter has been murdered and the four are responsible, they exact their revenge.Just like most people, I watched this film because of the hyped up controversially realistic sexual violence. However, I was also a 17 year old teen boy who did not yet have children of his own, understand the sociological negative effect of such films, and the wisdom to steer way clear. What the eyes see and the ears hear the brain can never erase.But let's talk horror since this film is referred to by many as a "ground-breaking" film of that genre. Several of my reviews indicate my belief that "snuff" (actual murder filmed for profit) exists and someday will become the next mainstream horror. Why? Because a great many people enjoy watching realistic depictions of torture and murder; the more realistic, the better. That is what today's horror film has devolved to. It is not about intense suspense, disturbing ambiguity, and bizarre oddities anymore. It is just about how "in your face" and realistic the violence is, especially if it is sexual violence. Craven attempts even more irony by running pleasant-sounding music simultaneously with the torture and murder scenes of the two girls. The resulting effect: utterly ridiculous absurdity. The music absolutely sucks, to boot. The acting is pathetic as well. Mari's script reads like a fourth grader's attempt at Shakespeare. The criminals come across as so idiotic that there is no way they could actually drive a car let alone successfully escape from jail, and the rest of the cast assist in transforming this film into an unintended botched and unfunny comedy.Undoubtedly, if you're reading reviews of this film and have not seen it, you probably will. I strongly encourage you not to, though. The only reason people do is for the sexual violence, and not only is that fairly brief, the greater question you should ask yourself is: why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie back in the early '80's on a double date with my gf at the time, and a good friend and his gf. My friend and I spent the entire film laughing at the atrocious acting, while our dates rolled their eyes and chastised us for taking them to such a horrible film. How ANYONE could be haunted by this movie, (other than by the fact that Wes Craven ever got to make another film after this garbage) is completely beyond me. His later films have much more graphic violence than this movie. As you might guess by my board name, I'm a fan of '70's films, and the only reason I even remember it is because it's a virtual tour-de-force in bad acting and movie-making. It gets a 1 in my book just for it's '70's exploitation\grindhouse style, but that's only because I can't vote any lower.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven's best and most twisted movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the most f@#$ed up American film ever made.Young Wes Craven must've had a lot of anger built up in him when he made this,either that or a lot of balls.And seeing that this is his first movie,I think that he has a lot of f@#$in guts.It's about two teenage girls trying to score some weed before a concert and end up being kidnapped by four whackos(one of them brilliantly played by David Hess)who take them out to the woods and systematically rape,torture,mutilate,and murder them. A nasty disembowelment scene is quite extreme.Then the whackos,who are on the run from the law,take refuge(accidentally) in one of the girls' house.And when the parents find out what happened they wreak bloody vengeance on them.David Hess Gets it with a f$#@ing chainsaw,and another whacko gets his penis bit off by the mother.What really makes this a disturbing movie,is not just the squeamish violence or the nasty rape and humiliation scenes,but the acting by both the victims and the whackos.Put that together with the gritty,documentary style film-making, and it makes you feel like your watching something real.One of my favorite things about this movie is the subtext of how sometimes normal people have to become as f@#$ed up and crazy as the whackos to survive. Watch out for the scene where David Hess makes one of the girls pee herself.Hess is extremely cold and especially evil in that specific scene.People who are used to the new,Hollywood style,pussified version of Wes Craven will be very put off.This(along with his second movie The Hills Have Eyes) is a very raw,bestial,primordial Wes Craven movie.It gets down to the real terrors that are out there in America today.It's a hard movie to watch,but if you can stomach it,it's also a very beautiful movie.Fans of Hostel:don't watch cause it'll make you cry.Everybody else:watch this f@#$ing movie,it's f#$%ing awesome.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>first, let me say that i truly had high hopes for this movie. having said that, i was primarily disappointed with what i saw. i expected to see a landmark horror film along the same historic lines as 'the Texas chainsaw massacre,' yet the movie i saw was not only not shocking by today's standards, it was also much too amateurishly executed to be effective. and again, let me admit right up front that i was perfectly willing to not look at it with overtly critical eyes, but rather with an eye for the 'overall effect' as it were. still i came away feeling i had been taken for a very foolish ride. so much so that i ultimately began to wonder whether mr craven had originally intended to actually film a darkly humorous 'parody' of a horror film or a horror film proper. i tend to think mr craven was merely aiming to amuse us with parody, not so much shock us. i concur with another reviewer who found the music and the sheriff and deputy's antics way too pointlessly corny and irrelevant to the overall effect. in terms of actual 'shock value,' i found the movie severely lacking once again, and i must conclude that if a film claims to be hailed as a horror classic, it must manage to at least shock the audience to some degree. the shock value in this film, while minuscule, was rendered even more laughable by the amateurish direction. a horror classic should be timelessly classic; meaning it should stand the test of time, such as 'texas chainsaw massacre' still manages to do this many years after it was filmed. in the case of 'last house,' the shock value only begins to raise an unwilling eyebrow IF one puts it in the context of the time period in which it was filmed. again, that is a huge flaw of the film: it does not stand the test of time. now, having said that, i am willing to concede that this movie must be viewed as historically daring in the way it attempted to create something innovative and fresh within the horror genre. too bad the end result couldn't be scary. i think we do the film justice if we view it merely as a parody of a horror film, and not as a horror film proper.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Notable primarily as Wes Craven's first feature film, "The Last House on the Left" does not deserve the reputation it has garnered as one of the scariest films ever made. There's really nothing scary about this movie, except for the admittedly frightening idea of being murdered in your own back yard (figuratively speaking). Craven would have done better to really focus his film on either the murderers or on Mari. Instead, the focus is all over the place: first on Mari, then on the killers, then the cops, back to Mari, back to the killers, to Mari's parents. It all seems patched together and messy. And the uneasy juxtaposition of documentary-like rapings and killings (which are indeed disturbing) and slapstick comedy seems more like the product of a sloppy director than a tool used for its effect.No, "The Last House on the Left" is really only worthwhile viewing for horror buffs who want to have an opinion on it. Otherwise, you could produce something just as good using your home video camera.Grade: D</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Always enjoyed all the films that Wes Craven has created and this film is a masterpiece of horror and a very very down to earth and realistic depiction of true terrifying Horror. The actors all did a great job of portraying their roles in great location scenes in Manhattan, Long Island and even had quite a bit of comedy, blood and gore. Sandra Cassel,(Marie Collingwood),"Legacy of Satan",'76 just turned 17 and was very eager to face the world as a growing sexy young female gal and also had a girl friend from Manhattan, Lucy Grantham,(Phillis Stone),"I Feel It Coming",'69, who was hot to trot and very happy to show Marie Collingwood the thrills of being a young teenager. There is plenty of degrading and demented acts performed during this film, which clearly shows how very sick some adult men and women can be in this world. Marshall Anker,(Sheriff), and Martin Kove,(Deputy) both gave plenty of slap stick comedy to their roles and even had a ride on top of a chicken truck going to market. Wes Craven started out his career with this film and it has now become a great Classic to all Horror film lovers.</fullReview>

It certainly reflects the darkness and cynicism that is a huge part of the socio-political "myth of the American seventies". I actually wish that filmmakers these days would (perhaps) be allowed to be a fraction un-p.c., and also not take themselves too seriously; the people who made this film, pretensions aside, obviously did not.

		<fullReview>IF you are a horror/exploitation fan, and you didn't see this one, you probably shouldn't watch it at all. Last house on the left wont bring anything new at all. Its hard to believe, that people has emotions about this movie. One find it Disturbing, other find it shocking, some feel sorry for the victims... well this film is about NOTHING. Its story doesn't go anywhere, it doesn't make any sense, it hasn't been directed well, edited well, or played well. And most importantly: its not gonna disturb you at all.First of all this is quite a bad story, and it has the worst possible script. Seems that the writer was drunk through the whole process, and no one checked the finished material. Okay, Craven's been young when doing this one, but its hard to believe that there've been a director to this one, for it seems like no one knows what to do on the screen or behind the camera. People are saying totally meaningless things, walking around on the screen without any reason, and so on. The editing is maybe the worst I've ever seen. I just cant imagine how bad could the edited (or even the heavily cut) version be. The way some scenes are following each other just doesn't make any sense! The film has no rhythm at all, and at least the half of the scenes are totally unnecessary, and souldve been cut out. Acting: There is no acting. There is David Hess, who's still the best slasher character ever, and he's cool. Thats it. Forget everyone else. They don't know what they do, or what should they do. They're just on the film for some reason, looking confused most times. Don't ask me why. Most Walruses surely have more talent in acting, then these people. What about the shocking value? There's no shocking value either. It has a quite short torture scene, and thats all. I'm sure you see much more disturbing things just by turning on the news. I don't thing that anyone got shocked from this not even in '72. All in all this is a balloon in a DVD case. It contains nothing but air.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not sure how I managed to get through life without having seen 'Last House on the Left', Wes Craven's first movie and one of the most notorious precursors to the modern horror film. Made on a shoestring budget by Craven and Sean (Friday the 13th) Cunningham, I expected something original, witty, scary, and inventive. Alas, 'House?' is nothing more than 85 minutes of mind numbing tedium.The story is a badly realized example of the revenge thriller, a perennial favorite of exploitation cinema, and clearly steals elements from contemporary shockers 'A Clockwork Orange' and 'Straw Dogs', as well as the lurid violence and laughable production values of Hershell Gordon Lewis. The dialogue is laughably bad, the performances are universally amateurish, the direction and editing is incoherent and poorly executed, and the soundtrack is truly terrible. What's more there is not a single shock or scare to be found in the entire movie. The result is a virtually unwatchable example of the worst 50c-a-ticket drive-in trash; something to run silently in the background while teenagers fumbled to unfasten bra straps.The movie fails on every level, and due to the sheer boredom it managed to induce, has the dubious distinction of being the first movie that I have ever had to watch on fast-forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is terrible on all accounts, on a technical standpoint and in terms of content. There are so many things wrong with this movie, I'm not even sure where to begin.First of all, the story is quite schizophenic. It starts playing out like some sort of comming-of-age movie, then becomes a sort of psychological thriller when they meet the group of Manson Family wanna-be's and wraps up as kind of a revenge movie. Thrown into the mix are these two really stupid cops presumably thrown in for comic relief. Even if these two were funny, which they're weren't, I was left so depressed by this movie that nothing could've lightened the mood. Seeing the way those two girls were brutally tortured and then killed made me want to take a really long shower with lots of soap. And I don't think even that could've washed it all off.This movie was badly done on a technical level as well. The acting was horrible. There wasn't one single good performance from anyone. The cinemetography was really grainy and the film was poorly lit, making each shot in this movie look like someone's last known photograph. It also had the most inappropriate music I've ever heard in a movie (example: peppy banjo music being played over a scene where the killers carry the unconscious, drugged bodies of the two girls and put them in the trunk of their car).The only good thing I can say about this movie is that it eventually had to end. And when it ended, it left me in a really depressed, empty state of mind. I hear Wes Craven has since disowned this movie, and I can hardly blame him. I can only assume he got all of his mistakes out of the way with this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movie I have ever seen...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very anxious and curious to see how actually good and how frightening this movie really is. By the various comments I have seen on the message boards, I must say I was expecting something quite powerful. To my surprise, it just happened,in my opinion,to be one of the most crappy and awful movie I have ever seen. I'm sorry but I actually didn't find ANYTHING good about this movie.The acting was horrible, the music was simply purely irritating and the plot was actually very, very weak I thought. I mean, yes, it's maybe disturbing, but it would have been incredibly much more disturbing and scary if the actors weren't actually so freaking bad.The basic plot was maybe interesting at the beginning but it turned out that the characters were so under-developed that I just truly didn't care anymore about them in the end. I'm sorry to say that but this movie was, for me, only pure exploitative crap. It's disgusting but for absolutely nothing. For those of you who want to see true and genuine horror movies, I would suggest the remakes of "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Amytiville Horror" any day instead of this truly disappointing movie. Just do yourself a favor: don't waste your time on this film if you're looking for quality...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>please, can somebody tell me why people find this movie scary?? i was looking forward to seeing something truly frightening, and according to everybody's description it should've been... but i found almost everything about it absolutely stupid. it started off pretty good, i thought the conversation between the girl and her parents was funny. the "escaped convicts" weren't convincing at all though!! actually, NOBODY was. everybody's acting was horrible and THAT is what made me continue to laugh throughout the movie. just plain bad.. if i wanna see something freaky, i'll continue to watch nightmare on elm street!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"masterwork" is an overused word</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are certainly effective moments and even sequences in LHOTL, but I really think words like "masterwork" and "masterpiece" and so on are overused -- sort of like the standing ovation.The extreme violence in this film was nothing really new. It's hard for me to believe that Craven and Cunningham were unaware of Herschel Gordon Lewis, who had been marketing intestine-yankers like /Blood Feast/ to rural drive-ins since the early 60s. If LHOTL goes beyond Lewis and other exploitation filmmakers, it is in the relative realism of the performances: David A. Hess is far more believable (and scarier) than anyone in /Blood Feast/. I believe it was "Psychotronic" magazine's Michael Weldon who said of the Lewis film "if the acting had been as good as the effects it would have been impossible to watch." In the end, /Last House/ is a cut above most exploitation movies, but it is still very much of that family: the humor is awkward, the exposition sometimes nonsensical and crude, and everyone in the movie looks as though they are covered with a thin film of lubricant. But then the 70s were an ugly, ugly decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is all the fuss about??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had really high expectations on this one, but this was a major disappointment. I am a big horror fan but there is no horror in this one, just bad acting and stupid policemen. Craven can do better! Maybe if he had tried to do it more in the style of Bergmans "Virgin Spring" it would have been better, but unfortunately that's not the case. One of the few good things about the movie though is David Hess (Krug) acting, he is the perfect psychopath, going from "normal" to crazy within seconds. No one you'd like to meet in a dark alley! The musical score (written by David Hess) is great too, it gives you a creepy feeling not unlike the one from "Cannibal Holocaust", you think that everything is calm and OK but you will brutally find out that it's not. Conclusion: stay away from this one unless you are a die hard Craven/Hess fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It ain't no Virgin spring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has to seen in the context of when it was made in the history of film. Post Vietnam war and 70's grind house cinema. The reality and horrors of that war combined with cheaper equipment such as the 16mm Bolex camera, gave great means to many to quickly pump out cheap films for high profit returns. Horror did have a connection to the war, as Herschell Gordan lewis hit pay dirt during the 60's when he mutilated women and cut up people for the camera to see, as a lot of the filmmakers from this generation where either Vietnam vets or college left wing hippies who used the camera to show the horror of our human existence, through pre-images of the internet era, of soldiers smiling on top of corpses or Vietnamese villagers running down streets naked with their arms missing. Now to the film Last house on the left. Directed by a university lecturer, who looks like he wanted to intellectualize a snuff film and produced by a porn director who wanted to make a quick buck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not shocking or scary so much as simply depressing...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Early Wes Craven effort shows off the young filmmaker's burgeoning interest in everyday horrors. Craven, working on an extremely limited budget, creates a familiar scenario with ordinary people and then throws sadism, humiliation and murder into the mix (he did this again a few years later with "The Hills Have Eyes"). A drive-in variation on Ingmar Bergman's "The Virgin Spring", the film concerns two free-spirited young girls out to score some drugs but instead being abducted by escaped convicts. Craven has the germ of an interesting concept--allegedly based on a true incident--and he manages to mount the dread and terror effectively enough, but the movie is garbled and sludgy, not to mention depressing, with vapid, disgusting villains. Still, it's watchable until the revenge-laden second-half, which is so poorly written and executed it mitigates any real interest in the outcome. An almost-immediate cult success, "Last House" spawned many imitations ("House by the Lake", "I Spit on Your Grave", "Mother's Day"), but the movie lacks even the smallest semblance of class. * from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wes Craven has come a LONG way from this.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read an article enumerating horror movies that can appeal to left-wingers and horror movies that can appeal to right-wingers. "The Last House on the Left" appeared in the latter category, as it portrays some hippies getting their comeuppances for their carefree, love-centric lifestyle (of course, horror movies always kill people for having sex, as we learned in "Scream"). But even ignoring that, the movie looks VERY amateur, with lousy acting and obviously staged scenes. It's not terrible. It's just that Wes Craven's movies since this have gotten so neat that this one doesn't seem to amount to very much. Still, it's neat to see the parents getting nasty. Check it out if possible, but don't expect anything great.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It`s A Good Laugh</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Once upon a time LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT was banned in the UK but I fail to see what the problem was . It`s not a film to be taken seriously , I mean look at it , a bunch of dangerous criminals escape from prison and kidnap a couple of teenage girls . This might have been disturbing violent trash but it`s all done in a tongue in cheek manner . For starters the criminal gang somehow reminded me of Portland retro pop group The Dandy Warhols (!)while there`s a couple of keystone cops . The script is ridiculously contrived while the acting is truly hopeless and I can`t help thinking Wes Craven knew what he was doing while making it , it`s a gigantic mickey take in order to offend self appointed moral guardians . TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE is a later film done in exactly the same way and that`s why these two films are so infamous , you can`t help laughing with them</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sick and degrading</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A group of psychos (three men and one bisexual woman) kidnap two teenage girls. They rape and torture them to death only to be killed themselves by two parents of one of the girls.I love horror films and graphic things don't upset me but I find this film totally repulsive. It was shot on next to no budget and looks like a documentary which makes it seem realistic. Also the acting is good which makes it even worse. The scenes where the two teenage girls are tortured are just needlessly sick and they play cheerful music over it! When I watched this on DVD I had to keep turning it off because I was so disgusted with what I was watching. The movie makes you FEEL dirty by pushing this in your face.Purportedly this is based on Bergman's "The Virgin Spring" but I have my doubts. Also Wes Craven disowns this film now. He was so viciously attacked by people for the content of this that he'll have nothing to do with it. All the cast members were interviewed for a book on this years ago--THEY hate the film too and think it's a piece of garbage! Let me put it this way--one of the men went on from this to making porno films--he made over 100 pornos and STILL considers this the worst film ever made!This was a huge drive-in hit during the 1970s and 1980s and had an ad line which became famous--"To avoid fainting keep repeating it's only a movie, it's only a movie, it's only a movie..." It was paired with "Don't Look in the Basement" and "The House That Vanished"--two other really bad horror films but nowhere as offensive as this one. This is sick, degrading and an utter piece of garbage. Some people find artistic merit in this film which is scarier than anything in the film itself! Probably the worst horror film ever made. I give it a 1.</fullReview>
