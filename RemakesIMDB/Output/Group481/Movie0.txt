		<fullReview>I was surprised to see only one comment on this film in your files. It's been one of my all-time favorites since I was a youngster about the time it was made. Now that I'm reminded by looking it up here that it was a Preston Sturges film I can see why that's so. His classic comedies were unique. It must be also one of Rex Harrison's greatest films. Being a professional musician myself I can especially appreciate the symphonic ambience in which it takes place. I can also appreciate the possible parody Sturges might have had in mind of the great British conductor of those days, Sir Thomas Beecham. The greatest and most memorable visual effect of the movie (I've certainly remembered it all these years most vividly) happened when the Harrison character has to look up the directions for using the recording machine on which he was going to fake the evidence of his wife's still being alive. Onto the screen flashes the most outrageously complex electrical diagram comprehensible only to a professional electrician. This symbolized the inability of modern man to cope with advanced technology. One of the most hilarious moments in film I've ever seen. More viewers should catch up with this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sturges Hits the Bullseye With This Great Dark Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Director Preston Sturges' most enjoyable films, Unfaithfully Yours is a dark comedy which uses the skills of it's leading actors Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell, to perfection. Harrison plays Sir Alfred De Carter, a famous symphony conductor who has recently wed the beautiful and much younger Daphne (Darnell). Upon returning from a successful concert tour, Sir Alfred is confronted by his brother-in-law August(Rudy Valle), whom he had charged to look after Daphne while he(Sir Alfred)was away. Merely wanting August to drop in on Daphne on occasion, Sir Alfred is shocked to find out that August instead, enlisted a private detective to shadow his wife around town. Outraged when presented with the detective's file, Sir Alfred refuses to even look at it. However, he is eventually confronted with the sleuth's findings, which to his chagrin, reveals that while he was away, Daphne made a very suspicious late night call to a man's room wearing only a negligee. He is further devastated to find out that the rogue in question is his own right-hand man, Tony (Kurt Kreuger), a handsome, dapper fellow more closer in age to Daphne. Believing the worst, Sir Alfred's pristine world is suddenly turned upside down, and he becomes a man consumed with jealousy and suspicion.From here we watch Sir Alfred's gradual meltdown as the thought of his wife's infidelity haunts his every moment. Even the concert stage can't provide him any solace. While performing before a sold out audience, his mind is less on the music and more on how he will deal with the adulterous duo. With his baton wailing wildly, his mind plays out various fantasies; his first thoughts are of murder, concocting an elaborate scheme which will leave Daphne dead and Tony framed as the killer. In another scenario he sees himself as the forgiving saintly husband, allowing his young wife to leave with his blessing, even going so far as to write her a check to cover their anticipated needs. Finally, he envisions himself cast him as the crazed, pitiful victim, confronting Daphne and Tony and committing suicide before their guilty eyes. As the music ends Sir Alfred has settled on murder as his method of revenge. He abruptly ends his performance and proceeds to put his plan into effect. Hilariously, nothing seems to go quite as smoothly as it had in his vision. Harrison is masterful as the prim and proper husband who becomes the green-eyed monster bent on revenge. Under Sturges direction, Harrison succeeds in conveying the frailty of the male ego, when faced with the possibility that the little lady may have found the grass a little greener in the neighbor's yard. Darnell as Daphne looks ravishing as the suspected spouse. She ably plays innocent enough to draw doubts about her husband's charges, yet sexy enough to make you believe that the accusations just might be true. A very entertaining movie, I would definitely recommend Unfaithfully Yours particularly for Rex Harrison fans, as this is one of his finest performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is rare when a film is so funny that it will give me fits of belly laughter, and Unfaithfully Yours is one of them. Rex Harrison stars as an English aristocrat and eminent conductor who, despite being madly in love with his wife (played by Linda Darnell) realizes as a result of several misunderstandings that she may be cheating on him. While he is conducting a symphony concert he comes up with three different scenarios in his head of how to deal with her alleged duplicity. Actually carrying out these plans turns out to be an entirely different matter.Preston Sturges is always an excellent writer and director, but his quick wit and double entendres are a revelation in this film. One almost has to watch it two or three times to get every comment uttered and facial expression portrayed by our protagonist (Harrison). His delivery is superb, sometimes almost funnier than the words he is saying. Darnell and the supporting cast provide excellent straight and slapstick moments. Dudley Moore starred in a remake of this film in the 80's which was also enjoyable, but having now seen this film, I highly recommend the original over the remake. It is an hour and a half of pure delight.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great symphony of a comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though he directed a few more movies over the years, Unfaithfully Yours was the last great hurrah from one of Hollywood's greatest comedy writer-directors, Preston Sturges. But Lawdy, what a way to go out.The movie stars Rex Harrison in what might be seen as a kinder, gentler cousin of his egomaniacal diction professor in My Fair Lady (1964). Here, Harrison is Sir Alfred de Carter, a world-renowned symphony conductor who is still astoundingly infatuated with the woman he refers to as his "bride," Daphne (charming Linda Darnell). The movie never declares how long or short of a time the Carters have been married, but judging from their passion level, one would guess they're still in the honeymooning stage.(The far more down-to-earth married couple, Alfred's in-laws August and Barbara, are portrayed wonderfully by Rudy Vallee and Barbara Lawrence. Barbara gets all the great barbs off against her husband, who is only to happy to show his ignorance of them.) One day, August accosts Alfred with the unfortunate news that he paid a detective to tail Daphne while Alfred was out of town. Alfred is so convinced of his wife's fidelity that his reaction starts at outrage and goes haywire from there. Little by little, though, Alfred is given reason to think that Daphne might have needed some spying-on after all. At his concert that evening, Alfred conducts three pieces by Rossini, Tchaikovsky, and Wagner, and with each piece, Alfred imagines the stylish revenge he will extract upon Daphne for her presumed cheating.From this sober-sounding scenario, Sturges--as he always did--goes all over the place, from sparkling dialogue to skittering slapstick to rich drenches of sentiment. And the melange has never worked better than it does here. Just for kicks, take three of the movie's set-pieces: Alfred's achingly funny dressing-down of August for siccing a detective on Daphne, the first fantasy where Alfred hatches an elaborate murder scheme, and Alfred's drunken attempt to carry out the scheme. Three scenes of complete different tones, and they all plausibly fit into the same movie. Now try to imagine any modern-day comedy-maker whose work would display the wit of any of those scenes.The Criterion Collection DVD of the movie does it full justice. It includes a seemingly irrelevant but nonetheless enjoyable critique of Sturges' work from Monty Python alumnus Terry Jones. And an interview with Sturges' widow Sandy, as well as copies of voluminous memoes to Sturges from uncredited producer Darryl Zanuck, demonstrate why the movie was initially a colossal box-office failure. Zanuck hounded Sturges to the point that the gifted creator of (to name but two) The Palm Beach Story and The Miracle of Morgan's Creek began doubting himself as a writer, resulting in the final humiliation of Zanuck cutting the film on his own. Then a timely scandal involving Rex Harrison forever killed the box-office chances of a black comedy starring Harrison as an ostensible woman-murderer.Happily, Unfaithfully Yours, like Chaplin's similarly dark Monsieur Verdoux, survived its prudish times and has become renowned as a great movie. Alfred's take on Delius might be delirious (as professed by one of his fans, played by the great Sturges alumnus Edgar Kennedy)...but Sturges himself remains stupendous.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preston Sturges is criminally neglected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithfully Yours is a step down from his great masterpieces, Christmas in July, The Lady Eve, Sullivan's Travels, Hail the Conquering Hero, and Miracle at Morgan's Creek (I don't think I forgot any; I've seen all of his films which are now thought of as important except Palm Beach Story; I also haven't seen his film about Louis Pasteur or his final film, the one with Betty Grable, The Beautiful Blonde from Bashful Creek or some such title), but it is masterful nonetheless. Sturges' script is exquisite - it has one of the most unique structures I've ever come upon, which I will not ruin for any of you. It's also quite hilarious, as we can expect from the greatest comedy director of all times, American or foreign.There are a couple of problems, though. The situation and structure are brilliant, but the main character, while we can understand his mental anguish, becomes too mean as the picture progresses. As much as he seemed to love his wife in the first act, it is difficult to believe, even under the circumstances, that he would be that cruel towards her. Even if I did buy his awful temper (this guy's worse than Othello), it really is hard to forgive him for being such a tremendous *sshole when he comes around at the end. The film also suffers from what has to be the longest extended slapstick sequence in film history. It starts out great, especially the bit with the phone operator, but as the guy breaks more and more stuff, it just gets old. Also, with the telephone bit, the fourth time was the charm - it got a big laugh from me, but the fifth time was really too much. All and all, despite these criticisms, it still comes off as a pretty great and memorable film from a true master. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 1944's MIRACLE OF MORGAN'S CREEK, Preston Sturges and Paramount parted company. He was too independent a film creator, in a period when film was made in a studio factory system with levels of producers watching how films turned out. Most of his movies had been profitable (one exception was his attempt to do a straight dramatic story - THE GREAT MOMENT). But he was too big for this type of pressure. So he left the studio and proceeded to make two independent (or semi-independent) films. The first was THE SIN OF HAROLD DIDDLEBOCK with Harold Lloyd, produced with Howard Hughes. The results were pretty good, but certain flaws prevented it from being fully successful, and Hughes re-cut the film when he re-released it. The second, done at Twentieth Century Fox, was UNFAITHFULLY YOURS. Here, he had problems with Fox chief Darryl Zanuck that mirrored the problems he had at Paramount. But the resulting film was one of his best works. As mentioned elsewhere it was his dark comedy, his MONSIEUR VERDOUX (which appeared a few years earlier).Rex Harrison is the great British conductor Sir Alfred De Carter, who is married to the beautiful (but somewhat younger) Daphne (Linda Darnell). Daphne is sister to Barbara (Barbara Lawrence) who is married to a billionaire August Henschler (Rudy Vallee) Leading a major orchestra on tour, De Carter finds when he gets home that August hired a detective (Edgar Kennedy) to keep an eye on Daphne. There is a full report suggesting that her behavior was incorrect. De Carter is furious at August's actions, and goes to confront the Detective. But he finds Sweeney the Detective a fan of his music, and actually a fairly reasonable man. After an initial moment of anger, De Carter decides to read the report. He finds that the evidence suggests that Daphne has been having an affair with his secretary Anthony (Kurt Krueger). The background of the story, and an interesting sequence showing Sir Alfred in rehearsal, takes up about half an hour of the movie to set up the story. We see Sir Alfred (deeply troubled, and already snapping at Daphne and Anthony) conduct Rossini, Tschaikovski, and Wagner in a three part concert. Each time he conducts he is thinking of his marriage partner and how to handle her. He imagines a perfect murder that pins the killing on Anthony. He imagines an overwhelmingly saintly version of himself being all forgiving and generous to his departing wife, leaving a self-hating Daphne in tears. He finally imagines confronting Daphne and Anthony with his pistol and playing Russian Roulette, ending with his own shocking suicide.The concert ends, and the conductor goes home to put his schemes into effect, starting (of course) with revenge by murder. Of course, if this was a Lang or Hitchcock film the revenge would have been effectively carried out. It's Sturges however, so everything possible to carry out the "perfect" murder goes wrong. My personal favorite is a recording device that will enable him to make a record of himself saying "Help...Tony stop! Stop!" or something like that, and changing the pitch to resemble the voice of Daphne screaming! In the vision it was so simple. But the recording device falls through a window, causes Harrison to fall through a chair, keeps throwing the record off the turntable, and when he tries to follow the "easy to follow instructions" the plans look more complex than an atom smasher.The same thing is repeated for the two other visions, with equally embarrassing failures. It is only at the tale end of the film that Sir Alfred is able to find a quiet way out of the mess of his life, without any real embarrassment.Sturges did very well indeed in this film. Harrison was quite pleased with this role, which he felt (with THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR) was the best he did in Hollywood in the 1940s. He felt that Sturges' script was better than Shakespeare. The film also gave Sturges the chance to give Edgar Kennedy a splendid last moment on screen, as the Detective who loves De Carter's handling of Handel and Frederick Delius. Kennedy is only in the film about five minutes, but does well - even though he looks ill (he'd die in 1948). Lionel Stander, as Carter's business manager Hugo, keeps the annoyed conductor from ringing his idiot brother-in-law's neck several times. Linda Darnell is as sexy as she appeared in LETTER TO THREE WIVES, and to the end we wonder if she and Anthony did have an affair. And Vallee appears as hopelessly incompetent in being helpful as he was in romancing Claudette Colbert in Sturges' THE PALM BEACH STORY.But the film failed. There is a downer atmosphere around it of death. First Kennedy's demise (mentioned above), and then the Harrison - Carole Landis Suicide Scandal as well. The idea (to a 1948 American audience, tired of death from World War II) of humor from subjects like murder and suicide was too much. The film flopped, and Sturges never regained his footing. Following it came the half-way decent THE BEAUTIFUL BLONDE OF BASHFUL BEND with Betty Grable, which ended his Fox years, then his living abroad in Paris, and then the awful THE FRENCH, THEY ARE A FUNNY RACE. One can only say that at least Sturges did do the string of great comedies that he was able to do while he could, and be grateful for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World famous conductor Sir Alfred De Carter (Rex Harrison) is in love with his young beautiful wife Daphne (Linda Darnell). He suspects her of cheating on him and, while conducting three separate pieces at a performance, figures out three different ways of punishing her--including murder. When he tries to carry them out everything goes wrong.This movie is, at times, very black. It starts out pretty funny with Harrison spitting out his lines rapidly and his sense of comic timing was just perfect. When he has the fantasies though it turns dark and is pretty gruesome--especially for 1948. However, when he tries to carry them out and things go wrong, the film is uproarious. I've seen this film three times and I STILL laugh out loud at the last section. I saw it at a revival theatre two times and people were literally bent over in their seats helpless with laughter! This isn't for everybody--it was a critical and commercial bomb in 1948 and a lot of people still find it too sick to be funny. I can see their point--there's nothing funny about a man trying to kill his wife, but this is a MOVIE--not real life. It all ends happily also.My only problem, and this is minor, was Darnell. She seems miscast here. But the script is quick and witty, the cast is great and they all go full throttle and the use of music is superb. Basically one of the funniest black comedies ever made. A must see! This gets a 10 all the way."Purple with plumes on the hips"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkably well made but as deeply felt as a drawer of silverware</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithfully Yours (1948)I've never quite loved Preston Sturges as a director or Rex Harrison as an actor, so having the two of them together here didn't bode well, and I thought I'd announce my bias. And sure enough, on this second viewing I was reminded of a kind of crisp calculation that both of them have. Sturges makes amazing movies, no question, and the best of them (Palm Beach Story is my favorite) are hilarious classics. To see this one for what it offers you might first see a classic Sturges screwball from 1941 or 1942. But even those are clinical at heart (if they have a heart), so it's a little like sipping a very dry, clean martini and getting drunk. Alone. No olives. Wit and sophistication do better in the hands of Cole Porter, somehow, but see for yourself.Harrison the actor overcomes his harsh demeanor in a movie like My Fair Lady because the music and the style there give him some kind of liberty, but here he is supposed to be sympathetic in his demented cruelty, and I only wish him failure. He is, to be sure, plotting the death of his wife. Three times. And then the fourth, beyond the symphony podium, with its madcap bedlam. It's funny in that zany way you have to laugh at. And you will laugh.I love classical music and like the structure of the film, but as usual with Sturges, this structure makes the whole process detached and too too clever. Sturges himself wrote the screenplay for this idea way back in 1932, and if it had been shot then, before the Hays code, before the real rise of screwball, we would have had a very different movie. But what we have here is admirable and interesting, for sure, if not the zinger it could have been with a different tilt.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unjustly ranked, I feel, below the Sturges "Classics."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Possible mini-"spoiler" may follow:Was watching TV one night with my mother, many years ago, and this film was shown, uncut and only rarely interrupted by commercials. We got to laughing so hard, especially during a slapstick scene involving a very old-fashioned and cumbersome tape recorder, that I'll never forget that evening. The recording devices which would now be available to Rex Harrison's character, as a husband whose suspicions about his wife's fidelity have been mistakenly raised by his busybody brother-in-law, hilariously incarnated by Rudy Vallee, make that particular scene an antiquated curiosity. But so much of the rest of Preston Sturges' inventions and dialogues in this one more than stand the test of time.A few years after that TV broadcast this film was shown at Grauman's Chinese Theater in Hollywood as part of an annual springtime marathon of classic films. On the big screen the full gloss of Twentieth-Century Fox's resources, so well employed by Sturges, were apparent. The print was pristine and the whole enterprise looked and sounded so much better than a TV broadcast or video transfer ever could. I'll never forget the scene where Harrison's elegantly imperious orchestra conductor confronts an unexpected fan (Was it Detective Sweeney or O'Brien the tailor? - Can't quite remember, though I'm fairly sure it was the former, so well played by Edgar Kennedy.) and bitterly upbraids him for his apparent appreciation of classical music and Sir Alfred's preeminence on the concert stage, yet this underling is engaged in an occupation that Sir Alfred regards as beneath contempt. How Harrison must have relished those lines!With Alfred Newman doing yeomanly service in handling the complex musical chores involved in this project and Twentieth's own beauty, Linda Darnell, given a suitable opportunity to prove she was more than just a lovely subject for a cinematographer to lavish care upon, this film deserves a high ranking in the canon of Mr. Sturges. The 1984 remake, with Dudley Moore, is something I have studiously avoided and I note that it does not appear to be available on video.</fullReview>

Harrison's bravado and skill are utilized to their fullest as he turns in a gem of a performance in classic High comedy style.

		<shortDescription>If you think Rex Harrison is funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Preston Sturges' last studio film, Rex Harrison plays an orchestra conductor who believes his wife is having an affair. While conducting, he plans various schemes for revenge, each played out with the utmost precision and skill. He grows increasingly paranoid and grows more insane after each plan he came with fails.I expected much more of this, but this was based largely on my liking of SULLIVAN'S TRAVELS (1941). Most of Sturges' other films are perhaps not brilliant but at least they were hilarious and make for fine comedy, but this one strains for laughs, that are simply not there. Often hailed as some kind of masterpiece, I failed to see it. I'll take any other of his films for this one. At least they're funnier, hands down.The film is beautiful to look at, very stylish, and masterfully scored, but the main problem is, I'm supposed to root for a deeply unsympathetic character in a story that seems to exist solely to marvel it's own genius and complexity. What's more, Rex Harrison has no talent for comedy whatsoever. He tries hard but to no avail. All we are left with is supposedly witty dialog that has no purpose at all. I wouldn't dare to dismiss any Sturges-film, and perhaps the genius of this film is beyond my reach, but if you're looking for the old-fashioned madness of earlier Sturges, you won't find it here.Camera Obscura --- 5/10</fullReview>

After he returns from one of his tours, he is told by his dense brother-in-law, August Henshler, that acting on Alfred's request, he engaged a private detective to follow Daphne, his wife. That is the way for August to comply with an innocent request for 'keeping an eye on her'. DeCarter goes into a rage because he would never suspect his Daphne of any wrongdoing and rips up the detective's report.The famous conductor has everything working against him as a sudden attack of jealousy gets the best of him. Alfred begins putting a plan together as he starts to lead his orchestra into a concert. As each piece in the program is played, Alfred begins planning how to deal with Daphne because he has reasons to believe she has been cheating him with Tony, his handsome, and younger, male secretary.Preston Sturges, the creative mind behind this enjoyable film, was at the top of his profession. With this film he solidified his position as one of the most innovative directors of that era in Hollywood. He wrote and directed with impeccable style that characterized most of the work he did for the cinema.Rex Harrison gave an amazing performance as Alfred, the conductor whose jealousy gets the best of him. The last sequence at his apartment, after the concert is one of the best comic turns by this actor who goes through all the emotions, and furniture, in a frenzied manner. Beautiful Linda Darnell is excellent, although her part doesn't allow her to do much more. Rudy Vallee, who had worked with Sturges before, shows an ability to bring to life his character. Barbara Lawrence, Kurt Kreuger, Lionel Stander, and Edgar Kennedy are seen in supporting roles.A delicious comedy thanks to Preston Sturges.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Rex Harrison is a temperamental conductor and Linda Darnell his younger, adoring wife in "Unfaithfully Yours," also starring Lionel Stander, Rudy Vallee, and Kurt Krueger. Harrison and his wife are so much in love, it's sickening. But thanks to interference from his brother-in-law (a subdued Rudy Vallee), Harrison begins to believe that while he was out of town, his beautiful wife (Darnell) was consorting with his secretary, Tony, played by blond, handsome Kurt Krueger. As he conducts the orchestra in concert that evening, Harrison imagines several scenarios - one in which he kills his wife and cleverly frames Tony for the murder; one in which he pays her off; and one where he challenges Tony to a game of Russian roulette. Of course, when he actually tries to carry them out, things don't go as he imagined.This is a hilarious movie, with Harrison absolutely magnificent - and I might add, totally unlikable. One wonders if Darnell will stay with him once the bloom is off the rose. Lanky and sure of himself, though not particularly handsome, Harrison has a certain magnetism, not to mention a snappy way with a line. "Will I see you tonight at the concert?" Vallee asks him. "Yes!" Harrison yells. "I'm generally there on the nights when I conduct!" His last scene alone in the apartment is a scream, mainly because Harrison doesn't go for laughs but takes the whole thing very seriously and in character. Darnell is beautiful and appropriately cloying. Edgar Kennedy, as a classical music loving detective, has a wonderful scene with Harrison.I haven't seen the remake, but I noticed its voting average is lower than the original's. I can imagine Dudley Moore being quite funny, but this role, with its arch egotism, was tailor-made for Harrison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the final comic masterpiece from Preston Sturges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Writer director Preston Sturges made a habit out of kicking the legs out from under some of our most cherished virtues, and he turned his attention to the sanctity of marriage in this late career classic: a dark and malicious (but no less hilarious) comedy easily several decades ahead of its time. The vow 'til death do us part' takes on an entirely new meaning when a world-renowned symphony conductor (Rex Harrison) begins to question the fidelity of his beautiful young wife, and while in concert is inspired to fantasies of revenge, noble sacrifice, and suicidal self-pity by the music of (respectively) Rossini, Wagner, and Tchaikovsky.This is Preston Sturges at his iconoclastic best, sharpening his trademark wit to a keenness matched only by the startling, contrasting darkness of his humor. Notice how the catharsis of Rex Harrison's murderous daydreams lends an emotional brilliance to his interpretation of each musical score, and note too the malicious glee he takes in slashing his wife's pretty neck with a straight razor, and later watching his b?te noir consigned to the electric chair.Harrison's dapper English urbanity was perfectly suited to Sturges' unique, demented brand of verbal hysteria; one need only imagine Dudley Moore in the same role in the inevitable 1984 remake to appreciate the sophistication of the original. Sturges was not unaccustomed to getting away with murder in his comedies, but it's hard to believe a film of such daring poor taste could ever have been made under the moral straightjacket of mid-1940s Hollywood. Like all of the director's best efforts it hasn't aged a day since, and if anything is even funnier (and more chilling) when seen today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sir Alfred De Carter (Rex Harrison) is an aging British conductor who becomes extremely suspicious of his beautiful younger wife (Linda Darnell) and his handsome (but boring) assistant (Kurt Kreuger) after his wife's brother-in-law (Rudy Vallee) brings him a detective's report. Harrison at first refuses to even look at the report, but as his ego gets the better of him, he goes to the original detective (an unrecognizable Edgar Kennedy) and is visited by their hotel's house detective (Al Bridge) who confirms seeing Darnell going into Kreuger's suite in the middle of the night. Harrison does what any brilliant music conductor does-he plots revenge, and that means murder and framing his rival for the crime. Harrison (known for his own extreme ego in real life) seems to enjoy spoofing the whole idea as Alfred just gets crazier and crazier, first setting his dressing room on fire in an effort to destroy the detective's report, then furiously conducting his orchestra for rehearsal as if he were riding the winning horse at the Kentucky Derby. By the time his concert begins, he has decided to emulate Sweeney Todd, as we learn in the first of three fantasy sequences where he plots the perfect crime. But dreaming of revenge and actually carrying it out are two different things, and in one of the funniest sequences Preston Sturges ever directed, Harrison goes deeper and deeper into madness as he destroys his entire hotel suite while trying to carry out his scheme. This is slapstick at its most intelligent.This is a film where you are not supposed to like the leading character. That makes his over-the-top actions all the more funny, and Harrison relishes every moment. Darnell, of course, is truly beautiful, the most ravishing clothes horse of the 1940's, but has nothing to do but look lovely and confused as Harrison's menace increases. Lionel Stander has some amusing lines as Harrison's pal, while Vallee, Barbara Lawrence (as Darnell's sister), Kennedy, and Bridge offer fine support. Sturges, responsible for some of the best screenplays and for directing some of the finest comedies in Hollywood's history, adds another gem to his resume. The music too is wonderful, furiously as part of the plot as Harrison's insanity is. This was remade somewhat successfully by Dudley Moore in 1984, one of the more obscure classics to be re-done. It has grown in cult status over the years, but was totally overlooked for awards during its release year. The film remains a showcase for its stunning leading man who in spite of 40's classics such as "Blithe Spirit" and "The Ghost &amp; Mrs. Muir" wouldn't become legendary until he uttered those immortal stage and screen words, "Eliza, where the devil are my slippers?" years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is what we might call late-blooming Sturges coming as it did four years after his last Paramount movie and having written and directed eight movies for that studio between 1940 and 1944, the majority of which were successful he was arguably entitled to both a break and a different studio. It was Fox who were to benefit from the breach with Paramount and Sturges got to feature Fox contract player Linda Darnell plus Rex Harrison, who was still hanging around the Lot after shooting Anna And The King Of Siam there a couple of years earlier. In fact Linda Darnell played very much the same role she plays here - an ordinary girl who lucks into a rich older man - as she did for Mank the next year in A Letter To Three Wives where she substituted Harrison for Paul Douglas. This is at its heart a very bitter black comedy but perhaps because he thought it too dark himself or perhaps because he was 'persuaded' by the Front Office, Sturges leavened it from about the seventh or eighth reel with some hopelessly unfunny slapstick involving Harrison who is, above all else, at home with verbal comedy. There are certainly fine moments and the beginning is studded with Sturges one-liners but the ultimate effect is of an unsuccessful meld of bleak humor and slapstick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>overwrought and tedious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I feel very alone with my review. I watched this famous film by an exceptionally famous writer/director and I found the film to be, at best, average. It's really a shame, as I love old comedies and I generally like Rex Harrison. Given the material, though, I think the actors try their best. The absolutely WORST moment in the film was the excruciatingly overdone segment where Rex kept breaking things--stepping through several chairs, dropping things, etc. AGAIN and AGAIN and AGAIN. The scene was just plain excessive and seemed to last forever. It absolutely ruined the movie for me. I believe if Preston Sturgis had not been the writer, director and producer of this film, he never would have gotten away with it--someone would no doubt have questioned this repetitive and annoying scene. It reminds me a lot of the bad Jerry Lewis film CRACKING UP--a movie so bad it was never released to theaters. The two movies have the most over-long pratfall segments I have ever seen--so long and overdone that even Mack Sennet would have complained about the scenes!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing, but only up to a point...strives to be excruciatingly funny...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturgess has Rex Harrison emoting at a frantic pace, so much so that the others in the cast seem barely able to keep up with him. Rudy Vallee does, and gives another one of his expert comic performances as Harrison's stuffy brother-in-law who claims to hate music. Barbara Lawrence as his sarcastic wife has a few good one-liners that she tosses at Vallee. And Linda Darnell does a good job of showing slavish devotion to her brilliant conductor husband Harrison.But therein lies the weakness in the premise. Darnell is so obviously devoted (to the extreme and with extreme patience) to her temperamental artist of a husband, that it is inconceivable that he would, for one moment, suspect her of infidelity based on hearsay and immediately have her followed by detectives.There are three flashbacks--with at least one of them being very clever while the others don't quite fit the bill. But the final scene (back to reality) is an uneven blend of slapstick and sight gags that simply go on too long before the windup which has him adoring his wife again.Not Sturgess at his best and it's the script that's the main weakness because the acting is fine. Rex Harrison seems to be doing a rehearsal for Henry Higgins and Linda Darnell is charming (if unbelievably patient) as the doting wife. Good support from Lionel Stander, Barbara Lawrence and Kurt Kreuger, as well as Edgar Kennedy.Not as excruciatingly funny as it strives to be with a weak finale. A big bonus is the effective use it makes of classical music.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set to music, a symphony conductor (Rex Harrison) envisions multiple possible scenarios for dealing with his wife's infidelity.This film did not do well at the box office, and I cannot say I am surprised. While the idea of three alternate stories is interesting, it comes off as a bit boring and is not nearly as funny as something from Preston Sturges really ought to be.The only time I really found the film to be that amusing was when comments were made that I would have thought violated the Code. At one point, for example, the conductor makes a comment to his wife that he wished her father had shot himself before she was born. Wow, that's dark!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insanely Jealous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturges after leaving Paramount where he did his best work signed on to 20th Century Fox and his first film was Unfaithfully Your's. Starring Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell, it's the story of an insanely jealous symphony conductor who hires private detective Edgar Kennedy to get dirt on his wife whom he suspects of carrying on with Kurt Kreuger his manager. Some interesting items come to Harrison's attention and he's driven out of his mind with jealousy. In that Unfaithfully Your's is not unlike the Ferenc Molnar play The Guardsman which Alfred Lunt and Lynne Fontanne did their one screen appearance with and The Chocolate Soldier where that plot was used for Nelson Eddy and Rise Stevens.During the concert while the music is playing and Harrison conducting he imagines the many ways he can bring Darnell and Kreuger to their just desserts. In the end when it's real he makes a holy hash of his attempts with a non-speaking sequence that is something that many of the silent screen comics like Chaplin or Keaton would have envied.When Unfaithfully Your's was remade I'm sure Dudley Moore didn't have the sophistication of Rex Harrison, but I'm sure the broad comedy was something he could have done well.Unfaithfully Your's was not up to what Sturges did over at Paramount. Why he left is beyond me because seeing what he did there I'm sure that the studio did not inhibit his comic genius. It's still a pretty funny film and I recommend seeing it back to back to back with The Guardsman and The Chocolate Soldier.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harrison foreshadows Professor Higgins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film brings us Rex Harrison already foreshadowing Professor Higgins. He tries out the arrogant, picayune, verbally acute role and is absolutely successful. The seed is planted and we, who know what is to come twenty years hence, rub our hands gleefully in anticipation of Higgins. But Linda Darnell is no Eliza. Instead, she is a loving, docile, trusting wife, already dressed as though she will be meeting the Queen and looking beautiful and so very desirable.The dialog crackles and moves fast. Only Rex Harrison and perhaps Cary Grant could have have delivered with the wit and brio that Sturges deserved.There are two extended slapstick scenes that should have been cut shorter.Edgar Kennedy as a Private Eye has a couple of great scenes when he turns out to be a classical music devotee and is knowledgeably enthusiastic about Harrison's conducting.A digression: Harrison tosses a couple of tickets to the Philharmonic concert, they are orchestra tickets a few rows from the front row. Price $3.80, designated as "Patron"' seats.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yours Faithfully, Sturges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfaithfully Yours is an inventive spin on the 'screwball comedy' sub- genre that peaked during the 30s and 40s from Preston Sturges. It isn't very often that a film-maker leaves his mark on you with the first viewing from his output which is exactly what Sturges achieves here. With dialogue that is literally razor-sharp, laced with sardonic wit and a smattering of the slapstick, one might be tempted to genre-confine this film. Nothing could be more of a disservice to Sturges' work for while being a black comedy with screwball elements, it also carries a catalogue of human behaviour much darker than the average black comedy of its time. Only Sturges never lets the latter upstage the eventual purpose of the film ? to raise chuckles and leave you in splits.Firstly, the dialogue. The wordplay ('handle Handel') here suggests a liking for verbal content above all else with Sturges. All the characters deliver lines that are chuckleworthy if not downright hilarious. As such, a repeat screening is a must, if only to sample some piece of dialogue that didn't register the first time around. This aspect of the movie leads me to the other which is Rex Harrison. Cast here as the renowned orchestra conductor Sir Alfred de Carter, his performance hinges as much on words as much as it does on his brow. That is one mighty brow with a bearing to match. Any dark content here stems as much from it as from Sturges!Three pieces of Western Classical music play integral parts in the film. Rossini's Semiramide, Wagner's Tannhäuser and Tchaikovsky's Romeo and Juliet, high points of the Romantic Movement, highlight how the utopian perfection of imaginary scenarios can go wrong in every possible way when their realization is attempted. Among other things, Linda Darnell puts in a pleasing turn as Daphne, Sir Alfred's wife and the scene featuring the Simplicitas recorder ('so simple that it operates on its own') is right up there with the funniest of the funniest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithfully Yours - Too Much Class, Not Enough Laughs??!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Symphony conductor Rex Harrison discovers his wife Linda Darnell has been unfaithful to him, or so it seems, according to a detective's investigation and report, requested by brother-in-law Rudy Vallee, who misunderstood Rex's parting words (while he was on tour) "of looking after my wife" and of whom Rex does not like, at all.While this movie is good, (and I don't say this very often if ever, but...), it has earned a somewhat overrated reputation over the years. It is funny in parts and it has class in spades, but its ending lays kind of flat given all the build-up to it. Its main attribute is Rex's hammy performance. He's the whole show, with all his emphatic and vociferous syllables, including Rudy Vallee jokes that Rudy is a bore. (It's ironic that Rudy's singing career in the 20s and 30s made him such a ladies' man celebrity and sensation, but in movies he's typecast as a stuffed shirt.) Overall, you may like this, and you will definitely laugh throughout the film, but there's no last laugh that leaves you smiling out the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something For Everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a symmetry we seldom see in any comedies, by Sturges or anyone. It begins with a happy couple and dissolves into suspicion. Then the fun begins and the weird balance takes over. The conductor's concert becomes a three-act play with the scenes related yet illogical, as dreams so often go. After the concert, the conductor tries to relive his fantasies and virtually nothing cooperates with him. Preston Sturges was always brilliant with his dialog and love of words and here you see this at the beginning. That, for the viewer is Act One. The concert itself with the images of revenge makes up the second act, a black one at that. Finally, at the end of the concert comes the hilarious Act Three, an hysterically funny attempt to put the emotions and illusions into practice - with disastrous results. So the concert had its own three acts within and the viewer gets another broader three. The verbal humor in the beginning becomes a visual portrayal of revenge in the middle and a foiled attempt to carry it off in the end. I've never thought of Sturges as working with physical humor but he did here and extremely well. The conductor's attempt to pull ideas into the realm of reality prove as deranged as his suspicions. I think the presence of classical music scares many Americans away from the screen. Sturges appears to know the subject intimately well, so for me, as a professional musician, this is perfect film in beautiful balance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Sturges's most divisive pieces should have been a masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well well, I certainly found this to be a very mixed bag, I simply adore Preston Sturges, the satirical wit in many of his classic standards is still thrilling new fans as each year passes by. This one was one I had to hunt down to add to my collection purely because of its director, and what trusted review sources I looked at led me to expect an undervalued masterpiece. Sadly the film only hints at greatness and I wasn't in the least bit surprised to find that the film had been cut by 20 minutes such was the uneven feel I got from it.The film centres on a comic slant of misconception, mistrust, and one mans zany decent into jealous madness. Believing his beautiful wife is having an affair, top conductor Sir Alfred De Carter {an ebullient Rex Harrison} dreams three scenarios that will give him peace, all very different, and all played out to the accompaniment of classical music, Rossini's-Semiramide, Wagner's-Tannhauser, and Tchaikovsky's-Francesca de Rimini. These sequences lift the film out of the stupor that besets the piece for most of the first half, and this sets us up nicely for the finale as we see which route Carter has chosen and of course the mirthful results that ensues.Back on release the film didn't catch on, and we can only wonder what the film would have been like with the added scenes still in place, I like to think that Sturges really had crafted the masterpiece that some top line critics today believe the film actually is. The film was also blighted by a sad scandal as Rex Harrison's girlfriend Carole Landis committed suicide and naturally the films distributor {Fox} felt the films subject matter was just too close to the bone to support wholesale, and the subsequent lack of support practically killed the film on release to the point that Sturges never made another American film again . It's an entertaining film, the music working with the mindset of the protagonist works a treat, and the comedy stands up well to tickle the ribs, but it will always be a case of so near, yet so far, but that of course is my own humble opinion.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nobody can handle Handel like you can handle Handel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Preston Sturges was not only ahead of his time in 1948, he's ahead of his time in 2006. Many movie critics haven't caught up with his brilliant if somewhat warped mind yet. The remake of "Unfaithfully Yours," though not bad doesn't come close to the satire and farce of the original. Why Sturges even uses slapstick to spoof slapstick. Who else could take such a stuffed shirt item as classical music and the blatant arrogance associated with it and poke fun at it while at the same time giving the audience the treat of enjoying some heavenly classical selections that fit perfectly with the plot? Part of the fun in "Unfaithfully Yours" is to watch the ego of the pompous classical conductor Sir Alfred De Carter (note the moniker) being punctured and slowly deflating until all he has left are the murderous fantasies of an intensely possessive human being. Sturges' genius is to make us laugh at all this. Only Chaplin in his masterpiece "Monsieur Verdoux" can make the audience laugh at murder the way Sturges does in "Unfaithfully Yours."Not to take away from the excellent performances of the two leads, Rex Harrison and Linda Darnell, but the marvelous character actor Edgar Kennedy nearly steals the show playing the private detective Sweeney who just happens to be a lover of classical music and worships Sir Alfred who could handle Handel like nobody could handle Handel. Rudy Vallee too shines under Sturges' guiding hand the way he shone in "Palm Beach Story." Vallee was such a versatile entertainer that he could play just about any part but he was always at his best when Sturges was in the driver's seat.This is a film that the viewer has to watch several times to get the feel of what Preston Sturges is all about. Though Sturges left a gallant legacy of wonderful off the wall humorous works such as "The Great McGinty," "The Miracle of Morgan's Creek," and "Sullivan's Travels," this movie "Unfaithfully Yours" may very well be the best creation of them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quintessential Sturges and Harrison--but is that good?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not sure how anyone--Sturges or Zanuck especially--could figure that audiences would go for this picture. Here we have a protagonist (one certainly can't call him a hero) who is duplicitous, arch, and neurotic to the point of psychosis, played by an actor who hammers each of these characteristics home like a railroad spike. It's one thing to fantasize about murdering one's wife (without a shred of proof), it's quite another to then go about trying to do it in real life (with no more proof). Sturges seemed to think that making Harrison utterly incompetent and slapsticky in the attempt would make it funny. Whether he ever intended that the audience forgive or even tolerate this would-be murderer isn't clear. One passionate declaration after he's failed just isn't enough. And casting the inexpressibly beautiful Linda Darnell in one of her very few completely sympathetic roles doesn't help. She could play both sides of the fidelity coin better than anyone, but he doesn't give her the chance. Her fidelity is so overplayed at times that I was quite prepared for at least a little undercutting. But it never came. I wonder if a year later, his career in ruins because of this picture, Sturges saw "Kind Hearts and Coronets" and figured out where he went wrong.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a wonderfully savage way to bow out for the 1940s best American director.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This lopsided, stunning comedy is Sturges' last masterpiece, a bitter denunciation of culture, and the most savage dissection of marriage in the cinema. It is more shocking than 'Othello', sadder than 'Ulysses', both of which it alludes to. Like Othello, Sir Alfred de Carter is a celebrated, civilised hero whom jealousy drives insane; both men are linked to culture - Othello tells bewitching stories, Carter conducts - and both are failed by culture, which cannot elevate base, murderous, misogynistic instincts. Even better, for a Hollywood movie by a (till then) popular director, is that it attempts some of the formal daring of Ulysses. One of the reasons the film's structure seems so strange is that it doesn't follow a traditional narrative movement (eg of a play, novel or film), but tries to match the abstract patterning of music (like the episode 'Sirens'), the film's subject matter. The development of themes, motifs, antiphony, repitition, give the film the same fluidity, richness and depth of a symphony, and this plays havoc with our conventional narrative expectations.Further, like 'Oxen In The Sun', which relates narrative in styles pastiching the 'best' (clean, proper, elegant) of English prose, before collapsing in a babble of slang and dialect, UNFAITHFULLY YOURS develops its story through the history of popular classical Romantic music, from Rossini, to Wagner to Tchaikovsky, from populist musical entertainment made for the people, to solemn music drama more appropriate to cathedrals, to sophisticated souffle dilution, before Carter's narrative collapses into slapstick and farce, wholesale destruction, mirrored in the grotesque, carnivalesque, distorted music, and the painful lashes of feedback.Sturges' view of marriage is alarmingly bleak, not just including the reprehensible coupling of pompous, sterile miser August Henshler (a priceless Rudy Vallee) and his bored sarcastic golddigging wife, Barbara (like her sister - Carter's misogyny is not without some justification; and the film is a rare Hollywood analysis of class). The film opens with symbolic ominousness, as a wife waits at an airport for a husband who is lost somewhere in the sky, possibly in danger. Their reunion is sheer theatre, complete with audience and critics; and their first night together is rudely interrupted (witnessed) by the man whose intrusions will be central to the following plot, Tony. The film is full of this idea of theatre, that the lives we lead are mere crippling performances for a society full of begrudgery, indifference and contempt.The important thing about the early scenes is how much Carter is to blame, how useless he is at marriage beyond the pleasureable physical duties. He is almost always away from his wife, or putting her off when he is there, delegating his responsibilities to his secretary so that he might as well be her lover - Carter's jealousy is really only a hypocritical smokescreen for guilt and neglect. He thinks throwing money and dresses at Daphne is enough - he is closer to August than he would care to admit. His abrasive ego and violent clipped wit is hugely amusing and full of a brisk energy, but it consumes and negates all around him. He is an all-powerful man, a magician, the centre of public attention - he can make a legion of men do his bidding, and make hundreds more applaud him for doing so. This necessitates a regulated life, all the elements therein subservient to his will. So when his wife is possibly having an affair, he loses control. His sense of wholeness is split, but this is figured in the fragmentation of his wife (when he first suspects, she is reflected in a mirror; in the next sequence, she is divided into three by a double mirror), so bound up is she in his self image.After a slow start, this is monstrously funny, and Carter's decline is dramatised in his change of comic registers, from verbal ('intellectual') comedy, to broad, 'vulgar' slapstick, from construction (of neat sentences etc.) to destruction, from activity to passivity. Decades before Cultural Studies came into being, Sturges links Dead White Male culture to masculinity and the arbitrary, brutal power of patriarchy is shown in all its unlovely violence. The fantasy sequences are delirious, wicked, frightening and plausible (with disorientating zooms into Carter's eye reminiscent of VERTIGO)., and a thrill to see in a 40s Hollywood film, but Sturges is well aware that the pleasure we get from Carter murdering Daphne (explicitely eroticised) is very real, a release of what we (men anyway) feel but would never admit. In this way, YOURS is a forerunner of PEEPING TOM. Although this is definitely the work of a misanthropist, there are glimmers of humanity, especially Sweeney the detective, whose loneliness is genuinely moving; he is the only character for whom music actually enriches. It is odd that a late 40s American film featuring detectives should have that figure as a receptacle of hope and humanity, and the man of culture, breeding and nobility the noir hero. There are some unexpectedly delightful bits of irrelevant business, such as Daphne and August dropping things from the balcony on an old dowager. Sturges' use of space and architecture to dramatise emotion is once again masterly and Antonionian - the whole final third is a superb depiction of domestic alienation, Carter's ignorance of his own home revealing about his marriage; when he goes to confront Tony, the corridor's geometry is a chilling vanishing point; his mute walk through Tony's room is like the perambulaitons of a ghost.</fullReview>

Rex Harrison hams it up, trying to be funny (his technique being to speak loudly and quickly) but he only succeeds in irritating the viewer. Then, whilst conducting an orchestra, he imagines 3 scenarios as a result of believing that his wife has cheated on him. He tries to put one of these scenes into practice and makes a drawn out mess of it that tests the viewers' patience as we are expected to laugh along with the unfunny antics that ensue.Harrison is way too OTT and the film contains a lot of slapstick, very obvious, visual humour which tediously drags on. An example of the humour you can expect goes like this: Harrison stands on a chair but puts his foot through it (ha ha ha), then he opens a cupboard and something falls on his head (ha ha ha), then he drops something (ha ha ha), then he puts his foot through the chair again (ha ha ha), then he falls over, etc - this scene goes on for 10 -15 minutes but it seems like a billion hours. And its not funny at any point.The film is very boring.</fullReview>

While not as polished as such early masterpieces as "The Lady Eve" and "Sullivan's Travels," it is quite amusing. Harrison is well cast as the flustered conductor, although he tends to deliver his lines so rapidly at times that subtitles would have been helpful. Darnell looks gorgeous as his wife, and Vallee is funny as his brother-in-law. The scenes with the recording machine are hilarious.

		<shortDescription>An arid technical exercise and not nearly as clever or funny as it thinks it is</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite liking a couple of his movies, I've never been a fan of Preston Sturges, and a second viewing of Unfaithfully Yours did nothing to change that. With rare exceptions like Frasier or Comme une Image, most supposedly 'sophisticated' comedies are usually either too clever by half or not half as clever as they think they are: this definitely falls into the latter category. It may be slightly more articulate, but it still comes down to pratfalls and clichés clumsily dispensed (not to mention an incredibly one-dimensional role for Linda Darnell as the wife whose sole reason for existence seems to be to worship her husband).Unfortunately it soon becomes apparent that despite his confidence in the early part of the film, Rex Harrison is entirely wrong for the part: aside from being so incredibly unsympathetic that he simply alienates you for most of the film, he has absolutely no facility for physical comedy, which renders what could and should have been a great comic set piece where he accidentally trashes his hotel room far more thoroughly than any rock star ever could even dream of rather tedious and protracted. (Alfred Newman's surprisingly crudely over the top slide-whistle and horn 'comic' underscoring all but stones the scene to death, a surprising lapse of judgement from a great composer in a film revolving around classical music.) In the hands of an actor with a modicum of physical comedy timing it could have been gold, but instead it's almost reduced to a technical exercise.But the same could be said for much of the film. The idea of having the execution and resolution of Harrison's fantasies dictated by the pace of the music he conducts (Rossini for murder, Wagner for mournful forgiveness, Tchaikovsky for suicide) is inspired, but it results in scenes that feel forced, as if at the mercy of a galley slave master's drumbeat. That the scenes themselves are so predictable doesn't help, as goodwill and admiration gradually gives way to boredom in the second half.There are, however, two saving graces. One is the scene in private detective Edgar Kennedy's office, where Harrison is furious to discover that the man he has come to castigate is a knowledgeable fan with his own tale of loss. The scene is crudely performed and reads better than it plays, but there's heart and humanity there that's lacking in too much of the rest of the film. But the film's genuine standout moment is the orchestra rehearsal, one of the best pieces of filmed musical performance in the movies, not only showing how the music is constructed but showing the life, character and human soul behind it. The loss of those qualities in the rest of the movie is all the more keenly felt in an increasingly arid and overplayed technical exercise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Preston Sturges drives me a little crazy. He has such great ideas, builds such terrific conceptual layers, innovates in such original ways...And then tosses stupid, ordinary humor all over it as if to say that this precious porcelain vase was created only to display a crude dirty joke on it.And he has an amazing lack of ability to differentiate his levels of abstraction with different tones. Usually anyway.In this case, he has three different levels. There's the level we start out with: the man, an emotional genius who comes to believe his wife is cheating on him.Then we have a second level, literally what is going on in his mind while conducting. He is watched by an audience while we ? another audience ? watches the movie within. Three movies: he kills her and frames the lover, he forgives, he kills himself.There is some distance between these two levels, The second is deftly choreographed to match the music being played while the story is imagined.Then we have the third level. It is a comic layer over top of the other two. This is broadly comic, from a different world. It is differentiated a bit by comic music and odd sound effects. But not enough to work.And you have to be really wanting to laugh to think this is amusing at all.But the construction is so novel, so perfect, so transporting (despite the hammy acting) that we forgive it all. This is an important movie.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The last half hour of the movie is hilarious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think that the last half hour of this movie is the funniest 30 minutes of film, period. Rex Harrison delivers the best slapstick performance I have ever seen here, and I found it completely unexpected -- My Fair Lady didn't prepare me for this .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unfaithfully Yours is Just That **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A ridiculous film, at most, with a symphony director, Rex Harrison, led to believe that his wife, Linda Darnell, has been unfaithful film. Most of the film is devoted to Harrison leading the symphony while concocting possible ideas in his mind to deal with the situation.Rudy Vallee is totally wasted here as his brother-in-law, a millionaire who misunderstood when Harrison told him to keep an eye on his wife while he is away in England.Vallee hires a private detective who has pictures of Darnell leaving Harrison's secretary's room.After imagining what he is going to do, Harrison storms out of a performance and goes home and each of his plans is again shown.The picture is a foolish one; far beneath that of Harrison, Darnell and others.The picture is made more foolish by the way Harrison wrecks his apartment during his plans to create mayhem.This is utterly ridiculous and annoying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rex Harrison surely rued the day he ever got involved in this turkey. It was doomed to fail at least because it plays so much classical music most movie-goers have no interest in. What's more, Harrison is a miserable simulacrum of a conductor such as it is, and the music is pot-boilers from Rossini, Wagner and Tchaikovsky (of course).The plot is utterly implausible, contrived and contorted. The acting is good by Harrison, satisfactory by Darnell, then goes down from there. Even considering this is a "black" comedy, the other characters are poorly developed caricatures. The putting-out-the-fire scene has to be one of the stupidest ever published.Maybe it would make more sense once medical marijuana is legalized, but for now, steer clear of this confusing mess.</fullReview>
