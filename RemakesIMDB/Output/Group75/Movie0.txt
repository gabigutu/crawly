		<shortDescription>Every Married Man Should Have His Fling -- But Be Careful Not to Get Flung Too Far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Laurel &amp; Hardy's "pre-team" comedies, one of several shorts both men appeared in more or less coincidentally before they developed their familiar childlike characters, i.e. the duo with the derby hats we all know and love. In this go-round Jimmy Finlayson is basically the lead player (although Mae Busch originally received top billing), and yet Stan steals the show in a prominent supporting role. Oliver Hardy is relegated to a minor part, and he dutifully reacts to the antics of the other players without any real comic business of his own to perform. Four years later, however, after Laurel &amp; Hardy had become the top comics on the Hal Roach lot, Love 'Em and Weep would be remade as a talkie and retitled Chickens Come Home, with Hardy in the lead, Stan and Mae Busch repeating their earlier roles, and Finlayson reduced to playing Hardy's butler. Something of a comedown for Fin, though it must be said he played his part to a fare-thee-well on that occasion.At any rate, Love 'Em and Weep is quite enjoyable in its own right, that is, if you enjoy a good old fashioned marital farce. All the ingredients are in place: Finlayson is a respectable bourgeois businessman (profession not specified) who is thrown for a loop when an old girlfriend pops up and attempts to blackmail him. His wife, of course, enters at an inopportune moment and the girlfriend is forced to hide in the bathroom. Finlayson must then explain the presence of her cigarette, fur stole, etc., to his gimlet-eyed wife. The angry girlfriend later shows up uninvited at Finlayson's home while he's entertaining guests and creates even more havoc.This sort of thing can be tiresome if not well handled -- lesser comedians cranked out dozens of interchangeable short comedies along these lines -- but in this case, the first-rate performers manage to squeeze a lot of laughs out of the situation. Mae Busch is every inch the foxy, smirking troublemaker in the opening scene, and Finlayson's pop-eyed double-takes are as strenuous as ever. Okay, so maybe he was a one-note performer, but he certainly perfected that one note! Stan is quite funny as Finlayson's assistant, a man who (we are told) has great control over women, although we are offered no evidence of this. Quite the contrary! Stan's hair was still slicked down at this point, but he'd already perfected that familiar look of blank vacancy, and when the plot reaches a crisis we get a quick sample of the Laurel Cry.Love 'Em and Weep is by no means the best comedy short ever made, but it's also far from the worst, and it amounts to a very pleasant diversion for the undemanding viewer. For me, this movie also served to demonstrate the difference an audience can make when viewing a silent comedy of this vintage. I first saw the film at home on TV with a friend and found it moderately amusing, but later, when I was fortunate enough to see it again at a public screening, with live music and an appreciative audience, it was as if a fossilized dinosaur skeleton had suddenly come back to life with a roar. Gags and pratfalls that seemed mildly funny at home rocked the house when seen with a crowd. I can only urge interested viewers to try to see these movies with an audience whenever possible, and if there's no place in your community where this is taking place, then start your own Film Society!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you DON'T think of it as a Laurel and Hardy film, it's exceptional for 1927</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this is often billed as a "Laurel and Hardy film", it really isn't. A more correct description might be a "Laurel and James Finlayson film with a small bit part by Oliver Hardy". And as long as your heart is not 100% set on seeing a Laurel and Hardy film, you'll probably enjoy this film a lot, as the film does compare very well to the other comedy shorts released at the latter portion of the silent era.James and Stanley are involved in a situation that would later be repeated in several Laurel and Hardy shorts--a woman from James' past is trying to blackmail him into paying her for silence. James did nothing wrong, as he dated this woman years earlier, but this evil vixen threatens to tell the wife and swear James has been seeing her AFTER he got married! So, desperate and unwilling to risk telling the wife the truth, he gets his employee, Stanley, to run interference by taking the vixen out for a good time until James can slip away and make the payoff. Unfortunately, Stan is ALSO married and the bad woman makes his life pretty tough as well. Much of the film is spent on this dilemma. However, the film ends very well with an exceptional sight gag, as Stan tries to nonchalantly walk out the door with,...well, I guess you just need to see this final scene yourself.Despite not truly being a Laurel and Hardy film, the short is very well-made and entertaining. Give it a shot--it's much better than you'd expect from a film without the later Laurel and Hardy formula.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake was far better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOVE 'EM AND WEEP was a very early pre-team short featuring Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy at the Hal Roach Studios;the only problem is that they share no virtually no scenes together,and the double act working here is Stan and James Finlayson,not Stan and Ollie.The remake,CHICKENS COME HOME(1931),when the Laurel and Hardy team was well established,is far superior with less frantic pacing and better characterisation.Like Finlayson,several L&amp;H co-stars make their first appearance with the boys;Charlie Hall,Mae Busch.Although the above remake has 10 minutes extra footage(foreign versions had even more footage),Laurel and Hardy together are far funnier than Laurel and Finlayson,though Fin is great as the blackmailing butler,played in this silent original by Hall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a Laurel &amp; Hardy movie and the remake is superior. Neverheless a most excellent comedy from the silent era.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, the movie has both Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy in it but it's not a 'Laurel &amp; Hardy' movie. They're not a comical duo in this movie and they actually share very little sequences together, since Hardy's role is only a bit part. The real main character of this movie is perhaps James Finlayson. Not that I'm complaining about it thought, I love James Finlayson! He has an excellent comical timing and facial expressions, which fits the genre extremely well.The movie was later in 1931 remade again by Laurel &amp; Hardy with sound this time, under the name "Chickens Come Home". That movie is basically a scene-by-scene remake only with the actors in different roles. (Oliver Hardy in the James Finlayson role and James Finlayson as the butler, among other changes.) Yet the remake is better, not only because it has sound but also because it has more sequences with Laurel &amp; Hardy together with also as a result that the slapstick comes over as even more hilarious and the comical moments are just as well, if not better, timed and executed.The movie is fun from start till finish. It has some excellent comical characters in it and a very good build up. The movie gets more and more funny as the movie progresses and builds up to the unavoidable confrontation in the Finlayson residence. It makes the movie probably one of the better build up comedies from Laurel &amp; Hardy and the silent era in general.It's a very enjoyable and fun movie but not as good as the inferior remake, that is one of the better Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior to the Remake, but Still a Good Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Later remade as a talkie in the thirties as "Chickens Come Home", also staring Stan Laurel, Oliver Hardy and James Finlayson, this film, while inferior to the remake, is still a pretty nice movie, with the excellent Finlayson getting the lions-share of the jokes with Laurel quickly following behind. The plot, while the same as the remake, has interesting casting differences. Here, Finlayson plays the blackmailed husband, not Hardy, who is given the nothing role of a house guest. Laurel is in the same role as the blackmailed husband, but is quite unlike the later roles he played, and is definitely not meek. So, it's not exactly a masterpiece, but a good example of silent comedy, and a must for Laurel and Hardy buffs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reasonable silent comedy - but not a Laurel &amp; Hardy film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this immediately after watching the 1931 remake (which is a genuine Laurel &amp; Hardy film rather than a movie in which they both happen to appear) and it was a weird experience. The Oliver Hardy role is taken by James Finlayson who plays the butler in the remake. Hardy plays the judge and is barely recognisable behind a wig and thick moustache.The film is quite amusing, although it's difficult to judge objectively after seeing the remake. By 1931 the boys had had time to polish their act and some of the comic moments were embellished upon. This is still enjoyable enough, though. Elements of Laurel's character as it would become once he teamed with Hardy peep through every now and then, but his hair's slicked back and he isn't quite the helpless child he would become.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love 'Em and Weep</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Four years later, this film was remade by Laurel and Hardy into the Chickens Come Home, so it pretty much exactly the same storyline and most of the same comedy moments, only difference being that it's silent. So the old flame (Mae Busch) of married businessman Titus Tillsbury (James Finlayson) shows up blackmailing him, and his work friend Romaine Ricketts (Laurel) to keep her away from Mrs. Aggie Tillsbury (Charlotte Mineau). Hardy only gets a supporting role as Judge Chigger, a guest at the dinner party. Filled with good slapstick and all classic comedy you want from a black and white film, it is an enjoyable silent film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Laurel-Finlayson comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes Oliver Hardy did have a sort of cameo but the stars of this Roach comedy is james Finlayson who starred in a series of comedies in the mid twenties. Here Satn is Fins assistant and Satn has to distract Mae Bush not to cause havoc at Finlayson house. This film would be remade with Hardy in place of Fin and Finlayson in place of Charlie Hall as the butler. It was entitled Chickens come Home and is one of if not the best laurel and Hardy comedy. Differences between the two films was in Love em and weep Stan takes Mae to the pink pup. Plus the scene when they take out the passed out Bush drags on way too long. Nevertheless a great silent comedy. It is available on The Lost films of Laurel and Hardy volume 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurel and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Love 'Em and Weep (1927) ** 1/2 (out of 4) A married man (James Finlayson) gets a call from his old girlfriend threatening to blackmail him so another guy (Stan Laurel) takes her out to make a deal. Oliver Hardy has a small role and it's hard to tell it's him due to his wig and mustache. The film has some good laughs but many of them aren't too big. The film was later remade with L&amp;H working together in Chickens Come Home.Should Married Men Go Home? (1928) *** (out of 4) Laurel breaks up a quiet evening at Mr. And Mrs. Hardy's house but he and Oliver go golfing anyways, which just leads to trouble. This was the first official Laurel and Hardy movie and it works quite nicely. The best moments occurs towards the end of the film with a big mud fight. Another highlight is a gag by the malt stand, which was later borrowed by Abbott and Costello in Buck Privates.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 35 Year Old Oliver Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 35 year old Oliver Hardy acted alongside the 37 year old Stan Laurel in 'Love Em and Weep' under the direction of Hal Roach. A below average short silent film that lacks pace and a good script, but merely pads out their c.v. and pays their bills.</fullReview>
