		<shortDescription>"Somebody's coming to my house......."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For my money this is probably my favorite of the L&amp;H shorts (except, maybe for "Two Tars," or perhaps "County Hospital," or maybe "Helpmates," or "Another Fine Mess," or could be "Them Thar Hills"... oh well; you get the point). It's a hoot to see grandly pompous Ollie, in his run for mayor, brought low by the machinations of a former paramour from his "primrose days." Mae Busch, a stalwart regular in the L&amp;H flicks, is wickedly wonderful as the old girlfriend. Ollie's sub rosa business with his knowing butler, good old Jimmy Finlayson, is a delight, and the comic high point - a thoroughly discomfited Ollie warbling "Somebody's Coming to My House" for his dinner guests, accompanied by his wife - as disaster approaches, is a treasure. The Boys will always live in the memory of their devoted fans, to whom they brought so much joy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>[CONTAINS SPOILERS] At the office of Laurel &amp; Hardy, Dealers in High Grade Fertilizer, Oliver Hardy was rehearsing his acceptance speech. He was running for mayor. He had his partner Stan Laurel come in and write it as Ollie dictated. Suddenly, a visitor, Mae, burst in to see Ollie who remembered her only too well. She was his old flame and she wanted $$$. Ollie refused to give it so she threatened to show an old photograph of them in the newspaper so Ollie decreed they would meet that evening. Unfortunately, Mrs. Hardy came in then. Stan and Ollie quickly shove Mae into the closet as Mrs. Hardy enters, telling Ollie about the dinner party that evening so when she leaves, Ollie tries to call off the meeting with Mae. No dice. So Ollie told Stan to go in his place but first they had to call Mrs. Laurel to get her permission. She told Ollie that if Stan wasn't home for dinner, she'd break his arm but Ollie told him it was okay so Stan went over to Mae's house and she was anything but pleased to see him. At the Hardy household, the judge, his wife and other important people were sitting down to dinner when Mae phoned and demanded Ollie over. The butler heard it all so Ollie had to pay him to keep his mouth shut. Stan did all he could to keep Mae in the house, even barricading the door but that didn't stop her. She went out the side door. That's when Mrs. Laurel's gabby friend Patsy saw Stan and threatened to tell his wife. That's when Stan fell out the window, landed on the pavement and tripped Mae. Stan followed her to Ollie's. Meanwhile, Patsy told Mrs. Laurel everything so she grabbed a hatchet and headed to the Hardy's. At the Hardy household, Mrs. Hardy knew Ollie was up to something when he kept getting numerous phone calls from a strange woman. As Mrs. Hardy bid farewell to the guests, Mae and Stan showed up. Ollie decided to give her that settlement. He reached for his pistol and ordered her out before he'd shoot her and turn the gun on himself. Mae fainted dead away so Stan and Ollie try to sneak her out. Just then, Mrs. Laurel, hatchet in hand, arrived and chased Stan and Ollie down the street. A rather enjoyable Laurel and Hardy short. L&amp;H veteran Mae Busch plays the blackmailing old flame while James Finlayson is the double-dealing butler. Thelma Todd plays Mrs. Hardy. If you can find it, I recommend Chickens Come Home, though it's hard to find what with Laurel &amp; Hardy features and shorts being rare like they are. I wish they'd release them all on DVD. Like one DVD with all Laurel &amp; Hardy's works from 1929 then 1930, then one for 1931 then 1932 and so on. With the original trailer and everything. That would be cool I'd buy it, but anyway, a happy 72nd anniversary to Chickens Come Home as well!-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great thing about Laurel and Hardy's movies is that they were so simple, but so damn hilarious! In "Chickens Come Home", Oliver is running for mayor, when a woman (Mae Busch) from his past shows up to blackmail him. She threatens to interrupt a party at his house. When Oliver gets Stanley to stop her...well, let's just say that it's not that easy! You can just imagine how the people behind the camera must have been cracking up watching L&amp;H do these things right in front of them, especially the scene where they carry her (you'll see what I mean; it must have been a risqué scene for that time). A comedy classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another great memorable Laurel &amp; Hardy short!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chickens Come Home" truly is among the best of the Laurel &amp; Hardy shorts. The story is very simple but gives the boys lots of opportunity to show their silly antics. The end result is a simple but very hilarious movie.The movie is filled with many humorous moments. Especially the ending is an hilarious, as well as a memorable one. It's a very consistent, constantly funny comedy short in which Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are at their best and in the prime of their careers.Lot's of Laurel &amp; Hardy regulars also show up again in this movie. Especially notable is James Finlayson as Oliver's butler. He is fantastic and absolutely hilarious in his role. As always, he doesn't try to steal the show but he unwillingly still does so. Other notable regulars in the movie are; Mae Busch and Baldwin Cooke, among others.Among their very best work and therefor also simply a must-see for the Laurel &amp; Hardy fans!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guys This Is A Great And Funny Short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not often I feel I have to defend something on this site but after seeing CHICKENS COME HOME a few days ago I must say I'm slightly puzzled as to why some people think it's not as good as made out . I remember seeing this as a young child and enjoying it immensely and after seeing it again as an adult it's - Unlike a few other L&amp;H shorts - just as enjoyable now Yeah the flaws with this short are the same with any other one in that the performances are very stagy with lots of shouting and over emphatic mannerisms but no one ever complains about that in other short films featuring Stan and Ollie and unlike a lot of the other shorts CHICKENS COME HOME does feature a coherent plot instead of a lot of episodic incidents Some people have moaned that the duo are kept apart from each other hence this is somehow less of a success but that's all down to opinion because I was very impressed with the fact Stan and Ollie were both funny on their own throughout the running time with Ollie getting the lion's share of laughs . Come on anyone with a pulse and a sadistic sense of humour will wet themselves as Mr Hardy sings " Somebody's coming to my house " or screams when he sees an indiscreetly placed photograph but the best moments are the ones featuring Ollie and his Butler who knows too much . If I remember correctly there was a situation comedy from over 20 years ago featuring Keith Barron and Carlos Douglas called DUTY FREE with a very similar premise</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurel &amp; Hardy provide some great laughs in this one, Chickens Come Home-</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ollie is running for mayor but first he has to get rid of an old flame (Mae Busch) who wants to be paid or else she'll expose their affair on the front page courtesy of an incriminating photo. So he sends Stan to keep on eye on her while he entertains some important guests at his house with his wife (Thelma Todd) and butler (James Finlayson) in tow. I'll stop there and just say this was another hilarious Laurel &amp; Hardy short that I highly enjoyed from beginning to end. Finlayson and Ms. Todd's reactions really got me going along with, of course, Stan &amp; Ollie's antics concerning Ms. Busch's presence. And how about Norma Drew as Mrs. Laurel. And hearing Stan saying the iconic "nice mess" line was also great to hear! It should be noted this was made during the early talkie era when, if you wanted to see this in another language, instead of dubbing the lead actors would then read the alternate words at a blackboard off-screen with support from alternate players who came from the country of origin of that language or at least someone who knew it well. So now I'm going to watch the Spanish version of this short...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an absolutely hilarious sketch, that ranks with Men-O-War, Another Fine Mess, Perfect Day, and Twice Two as one of the funniest shorts the duo ever did. The show starts with Oliver--a successful fertilizer magnate (with dim witted Stan in tow) who's running for mayor. When an ex-girlfriend blackmails him, picture and all it's up to Stan to save Ollie's campaign, job, and marriage. The funniest part is when Stan and Ollie are carrying the blackmailer at the end Complete with furniture fight, car destruction, and other typical antics this is a great movie. The supporting cast is also great, complete with James Finlyson as the usual butt of jokes. An excellent move that has a 100 smiles in it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blackmail</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the silent comedy short Love 'em and Weep, with Ollie promoted from the role of judge to that of the prospective mayor who finds himself the target of blackmailing former girlfriend Mae Busch, while James Finlayson, who played Hardy's role in the first film, is relegated to that of butler. The original was a reasonably decent comedy with a few laughs, but this version is a much more polished effort. It's not the greatest Laurel &amp; Hardy short, but it's still pretty good even though the duo don't share that much screen time.My favourite gag from this film is one that doesn't actually receive any attention from the cast. Check out Stan as he pays a visit on the blackmailing femme fatale's apartment - you'll see the hooked top of a clothes hanger poking out from the back of his coat. Priceless.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chickens Come Home (1931) *** (out of 4)Hardy is ecstatic that he's in the running for Mayor but this joy soon turns to fear when a woman from his past shows up with a photo of the two that could cause trouble if it reaches the press. The woman, wanting money to keep quiet, tells Hardy to be at her house that night but the wannabe Mayor is having a dinner for various judges so he sends Laurel to do his dirty work. Laurel, being too weak to stop the woman, gets in trouble with his own wife who thinks he's having an affair but the real havoc occurs back at Hardy's house when the three meet head on.Chickens Come Home isn't considered the best L&amp;H short but it still manages to get some big laughs all the way to the outrageous end. The one thing that's always amazed me about the L&amp;H shorts is, usually, they run towards the thirty-minute mark yet it feels as though these films run mere minutes due to the high energy level brought to the screen by the two stars. The story of blackmail isn't any original or new but the boys make it seem as fresh and full of life as if this had been the first time we've ever seen something like it.The biggest highlight comes towards the end of the film when the boys must try and sneak the blackmailer out of the house without Hardy's wife finding out about the past. This little scene has the boys putting the woman on their back and making it appear she's walking out on her own. Another wonderful segment is when Laurel goes to the woman's house and does all in his will to keep her there. This includes a hilarious scene where he blocks the door with all sorts of items only to have her throwing the stuff back at his head. The dialogue is also very fresh and we get several laughs from it. The best moment is when Laurel asks the blackmailer if he can smoke and she tells him he can burn if he wishes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Laurel &amp; Hardy's lesser shorts, which still means its more enjoyable than most of what else passes for comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chickens Come Home" is one of Laurel &amp; Hardy's lesser shorts, which still means its more enjoyable than most of what else passes for comedy. Part of the beauty of the cinema's greatest comedy team is they managed to take such a simple concept as this and add enough complications to make it stretch out to the running length and do so without any overt padding. As usual, this is full of their normal hilarious gags which show them to be equally skilled at both slapstick and verbal humor. Also, what makes them so enduring is how likable their screen personalities are and their loyalty to each other. In this short, they attempt to help out each other as much as possible even though others stand in their way. Some of the slapstick and sexual politics could be viewed as politically incorrect by today's standards, but who cares because its so good natured.The main problem with this particular short is that the team is often split into separate scenes. While they're great comic actors on their own, they were always better when together. Even their scenes apart are enjoyable (if not as enjoyable as the ones when they're together). Its not on the level of their finest shorts such as "The Music Box" or "Dirty Work", but all their shorts are worth watching. They're pure Laurel &amp; Hardy, without interruption from songs or romantic subplots. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laurel and Hardy turn political</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, not really. Only the background plot is about Hardy running for office and the rest is the unpolitical comedy they always do. This is one of the duo's longest short films at almost 30 minutes. Of course it is in black and white and we hear them talking as the silent era is long over already by 1931. And everything is as always too for Stan and Ollie, especially in terms of the cast and crew. The director, writer and co-stars in here worked with the two comedians on many occasions. I have to say in terms of comedy I did not find this half hour too successful and I don't think it's among the duo's best works. However, it is an interesting watch for one other reason namely the perception of politicians in general media in the 1930s. Lets be honest, the photo that the woman used to bribe Ollie was really tame for today's standards, but it would have been quite a scandal back in the day I guess. Oh yeah and we also learn that Mrs. Laurel is a tough one and definitely the dominant half in their relationship. Not enough though to make it work for almost 30 minutes. Not recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rare three-reeler from Laurel and Hardy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurel and Hardy made a ton of comedy shorts together from the late 20s to 1935 and this one is a bit different because of its length. Unlike most, which were two-reelers (about 20 minutes more or less), this one was three. I'm not sure the plot needed the extra ten minutes, but the film didn't seem overly long or have any serious lulls.The film begins with Ollie in a very unusual position for one of their movies--he's a very successful man! He owns a manure business and is running for mayor. However, an old flame (Mae Busch) returns and threatens to blackmail him--even though they haven't been involved for many years. Instead of just coming clean or calling the police, Ollie enlists the help of Stan to keep this evil and very volatile lady busy until Ollie's dinner party with the judge and his wife is completed--then he can attend to Mae.Mrs. Laurel isn't so understanding when Stan calls home to tell her he'll be home late, though Ollie is the one that calls and tells Stan everything is fine with his wife! Later, when Stan tries to keep Mae in her apartment until Ollie can arrive, the explosive wench begins man-handling Stan--and an acquaintance of Stan's wife sees this and thinks the worse!Later, when Stan follows Mae to Ollie's house, Ollie is now panicked--and tells everyone that this is Stan's wife. However, when the real wife shows up, it's a pretty typical ending for a Laurel and Hardy short. In fact, the film's biggest weakness is the end, as it seems to end on a rather anti-climatic note.The film gets very high marks for energy and fun, though if you think about it, Ollie had done nothing wrong and this is a fundamental flaw in the plot. Still, it will give you a few laughs and is about average to above average for one of their films--which is still quite wonderful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy are the most famous comedy duo in history, and deservedly so, so I am happy to see any of their films. Basically Ollie is running for mayor, when old flame (Mae Busch) shows up with a photo of him and her together, blackmailing him to give her money to keep quiet. Stan is the one who has to keep her from getting to Mrs. Hardy (Thelma Todd), who is busy at a dinner party. Of course, the old flame and Stan squabble for a while, but she gets away eventually, and reaches Ollie's house, where the photo is brought by Stan, and there is a situation to hide it, but in the end, Ollie and Stan run away, including from Mrs. Laurel (Norma Drew) with a small axe. Also starring James Finlayson as the suspicious Butler who will only keep quiet when paid by Ollie. There were the tiniest moments of comedy, but it isn't a great black and white film. Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy were number 7 on The Comedians' Comedian. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pretty weak short due to the separation of the duo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Oliver Hardy and Stan Laurel are the heads of a successful fertiliser company. Hardy is ahead in the race to become the new Mayor of the city and is due to host a gala reception that night. However at work a lady comes out of the woodwork with incriminating pictures of a more carefree and loving Hardy which threatens his political career. Can Laurel keep her busy and away from the gala and, more importantly, Mrs Hardy?I noticed this short lasted 30 minutes which was 10 minutes longer than the last number of Laurel and Hardy shorts I had watched. I had assumed this was because it demanded a longer time and was a amalgamation of several really good sketches into a longer plot. Sadly this was not the case and the film didn't really work for me. The plot was simple and didn't need 30 minutes to deliver, and as a result it felt stretched beyond it's reasonable time span. There was no one scene that really stood out and I found myself waiting for `the scene' that most of their shorts have at least, unfortunately it wasn't there and none of the scenes really had the magic that they usually show at some point.The main reason for this for my money, was the fact that Laurel and Hardy were in separate scenes for a lot of the film. In this respect they didn't have each other to work off and this is to the film's detriment. While Hardy is at the gala, Laurel is trying to prevent the woman from getting to him ? this is the body of the film and it means that both men are working without their partner. Both are lesser performers due to this ? they are operating with one hand tied behind their back. The support cast includes the solid Finlayson but the film is too spoilt by the split to be redeemed by his trademark d'oh (which feels like it is rushed and doesn't fit in to the action).Overall I have seen several Laurel and hardy shorts and have yet to write a bad review of one ? until this film. I just found that Laurel and Hardy's strength is the `and' ? ie they are a partnership and work best when they are together. Here they are apart for too long and the film suffers as a result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overrated. This comedy doesn't hold in time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Chickens Come Home" (USA, 1931, 30 Min., DVD - B&amp;W) A Review by Jonathan Fain[7/10]This 30 minutes shorty is remake of their silent film from 1927 "Love 'Em and Weep". It is awkward, yet, has its moments. The editing was terrible, many cuts were out of their place, and made the movie look like a mix of unrelated shots. One scene for example, Laurel is on the phone and his response to the dialog comes 20 seconds late. The acting is so theatrical. Some respond shots are extremely overacted and don't match the scene. At the end when Laurel and Hardy try to get out of the house, the amazed faces of the servant and Laurel's wife are just embarrassing. Maybe the comedy doesn't hold the times. Maybe the audience has developed a different sense of humor. However, the social issues in this film are ahead of its time, and the women in this film are powerful (Though they still faint at a point of a gun).Highlights:* Hardy's wife picking up an Axe to find him. Great.* The ending scene where Laurel carries the blackmailer to hide from his wife is silly and amusing."Chickens Come Home" (USA, 1931, 30 Min., DVD - B&amp;W) | Genre: Short, Comedy, Slapstick, Farce | Director: James W.
