		<shortDescription>A political and social thriller/drama ahead of its time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer's surrealistic direction and George Axelrod's adaptation of the 1959 book by the same name offer Laurence Harvey a career defining role.Set in 1950's, A Korean War veteran Raymond Shaw(Harvey) returns home to a medal of honor for rescuing his POW platoon from behind Chinese lines and back to safety. One of the returning soldiers, (played effectively by Frank Sinatra) however, has recurring dreams of his platoon being brainwashed and Shaw committing acts of murder.He eventually convinces army brass that Shaw is still a puppet of his Communist-Marxist operators.Angela Lansbury, (although barely a few years older than Harvey was at the time) plays his mother in a tour de force role. She absolutely captivates and steals every scene she is in, playing a very complex role that needs to convince the viewer of many things without much dialogue.There's a rich cast of characters, including Janet Leigh, Henry Silva, James Edwards, and a painfully accurate James Gregory. Each character weaves through the methodical subplots and tapestry of Frankenheimer's masterful "Hitchcockian" pace.I won't give away the plot, but dear readers, allow me to sat that this one is really worth watching--until the nail-biting and chilling conclusion.There are many undertones in this film -- political, sexual, class and power, and social. You will want to view this film several times to approach it from different perspectives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Thriller with a few glitches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are parts of The Manchurian Candidate that are so perceptive and prophetic that it can be shocking. The satire of political campaigns and the influence of political wives feels very fresh. The film is also an excellent spy thriller and foretells the many political assassinations in the 60's. There are many fine performances in the film and Angela Lansbury plays one of the best film villains I have seen. Also, the directing, cinematography and editing are terrific.My problems with the film mainly stem from its dialogue. The script repeats lines from the book the film was based upon. The result is that the actor's lines are very often stilted and not believable. Other less important problems involve Lawrence Harvey who while he gives a fine performance needed a dialogue coach. He begins the film with an American accent and slowly takes on a English one. The Janet Leigh character is also troubling. It seems she is a Soviet agent but this is not explained. Her character is too subtle and clashes with the very straight forward presentation of the rest of the film.The flaws of The Manchurian Candidate would sink a lesser film. But when this movie hits its stride it is so powerful that it rises above its drawbacks and remains a classic spy thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful, Wicked Satire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By the dawn of the 60s America had not been through with McCarthy-ism, the Korean War, and Communist witch hunts when it was already aiming towards a Cold War situation and ultimately, Vietnam. So much plays into this movie which came out at exactly the right time and place that even years later, layers of subtext can be garnered from its paranoiac, frightening images.Power is a deadly thing to deal with, especially when it falls into the hands that should have it the least, and the word seems to dominate every angle of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE like a glowing ball of fire. The power to control minds and bend them to darker wills. The power to control the people into believing what the powers-that-be want. The power to demolish anything or anyone considered an even remote obstacle. The power to seize power, extend it outward, blindly, into a waiting globe.And so does this disturbing, dark tale of the search for power in the political world takes place, with some of the most indelible images ever transferred onto the face of cinema. Frankenheimer amps up the paranoia already oozing from the story and with some truly nightmarish sequences brings forth a Creation that always seems like it will disclose some hideous, unseen force playing behind the scene -- the deceptive hydrangea scene at the beginning of the movie and the train scene where a shaken Sinatra meets Leigh who seems to be sincere are two very uneasy sequences to follow through, for example, because both disorient and succeed in sticking needles of doubt into your mind in more ways than one. You know something is completely wrong here and what lies beneath is always unsettling than what is eventually uncovered.This is a character study as well as a political satire: while there is plenty of tension throughout, deep characterizations come through, and needless it is to me to state Angela Lansbury's terrifying performance as Mrs. Iselin, or Laurence Harvey's chilling portrait of a non-entity, a victim and a puppet who's design is to serve as a killing machine and a false hero. Much can be also said of Janet Leigh's Rosie, since her part suggests she also knows and is more than what she reveals, but sadly the film drops what might have been an interesting side story from the moment she appears on the train and talks in that coded language. It seems she only serves to be Sinatra's "controller." As for Sinatra himself, he's an asset and a weakness. He's too old to be Laurence Harvey's equal in combat, and his persona often comes through, but he does tune in a measured performance as the damaged General Marco.MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is one of those stories that detail the loss of innocence in America (with its killing of the more honest Senator Thomas Jordan and his almost pure daughter Josie, done without music, but in two long takes) and its transition to a super-power bent on political domination, and it chills to the bone to see it still today, 42 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! I was expecting right wing propaganda, or possibly even (a distant outside chance) left wing propaganda: I certainly wasn't expecting THIS. It isn't propaganda at all. Deriving any kind of message at all from the film is difficult - one might be tempted to conclude that we ought to never trust people who cry cheap political insults like "communist!" or "fascist!" or "racist!" at the first opportunity, but that's just a thought. At any rate, in order to get a message we have to think about the story for ourselves, very carefully, which makes it the very opposite of propaganda.Here's another bit of advice: don't make the mistake, as I did, of thinking now and then that Frankenheimer is drifting from the point. He knows exactly what he's doing at all times. Whenever it seems he's offering some interesting diversion from the main story he's really telling the main story by other means. How good the story is I cannot convey without saying too much. Probably the central conceit everyone knows already, which was why Frankenheimer was right to spill most of the beans as soon as possible - but he does has one or two in reserve. One great thing about the story is that it doesn't rely at all on us thinking it likely.Everyone, from composer to cameraman, did a fine job, and the cast does an even finer one. Angela Lansbury gives the performance of her life. Frank Sinatra I had never seen in a movie before, and I was surprised to discover that he can act - very well, too. It permeates down to the minor roles. Leslie Parrish as the charming innocent is certainly charming, but also subtle. "The Manchurian Candidate" would easily be the best of its kind even if it weren't the only of its kind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly, a gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably John Frankenheimer's best production, and Frank Sinatra's best cinema performance.I saw this because of the recent 'remake', I would assume that the reader will be making the same comparison. Having never seen this before, I found myself riveted to the story, and absolutely great performances by Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, Henry Silva, John McGiver, James Gregory, and Leslie Parrish.Coincidently, I had just recently finished reading some previously published works about the cold war, in particular the Chambers-Hiss court cases.It might be accident, but I wouldn't doubt it might have been intended by Frankenheimer to choose Harvey, who resembled Hiss, in appearance and McGiver who resembled Chambers appearance. When this was released in 1962, the Hiss-Chambers spy fiasco was still fresh in the public's mind.Other American political images are not for want of satire either, since Lansbury and Gregory seemed to have reminded me, in appearance, of Mary and (honest) Abe Lincoln.The pace, style and non stop tension rivals Hitchcock; it will certainly have you wondering if he had anything to do with this! Truly Frankenhiemer, excels here. Because Sinatra was box office magnet, most of his other roles seemed 'fitted' for him. Not here! You'll have a chance to see the real Frank Sinatra, really working to make the part work, and without a doubt, he too excels in his role.I don't think I'll bother to see the recent version yet. I want to see this original classic a few more times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Intense Cold War era masterpiece that seems to grow bolder and more intelligent with age. A group of U.S. soldiers are captured one night during the Korean War in 1952. Next thing the group remembers is arriving home with Laurence Harvey (one of the troops) being given the Medal of Honor for some unknown reason. He immediately decides to go to New York City to get away from his over-protective mother (Oscar nominee Angela Lansbury) and her senator husband (a solid turn by character actor James Gregory). But nothing is quite what it seems. Harvey, obviously with no experience in journalism, becomes involved with a publication that is sympathetic with Communist propaganda. Meanwhile several other soldiers from Harvey's battalion (commanding officer Frank Sinatra in particular) start to have disturbing dreams where the group is in a room during a dull women's meeting where the main topic of discussion is botany. Flashes occur however where the women actually become Korean and Russian delegates that are all listening to a crazed doctor (Khigh Dhiegh) who is discussing brainwashing techniques and total mind manipulation through various kinds of hypnosis. The dreams are rough and frightening. It seems that Sinatra has a rare form of war fatigue, but there is no way to explain how others are having similar night-time delusions. As he tries to cope he falls in love with the beautiful Janet Leigh and they start to have a relationship. Eventually Sinatra begins to put the jagged pieces together just as Harvey becomes serious with a beautiful young woman (Leslie Parrish) whose father (John McGiver) happens to be one of Gregory's main obstacles to a possible vice presidential nomination in the next national election. Who is really controlling everything from the inside and what is Harvey's main purpose for being brainwashed? Richard Condon's paranoid novel comes to life vividly in a truly outstanding motion picture. Screenwriter George Axelrod's adaptation keeps the momentum of the book at a fevered pitch throughout. Director John Frankenheimer (only 32 at the time) completed the one film that he would always be remembered for. His career honestly had a lot more lows than highs, but his full potential as a first-class film-maker is easy to recognize here. The performances are top-notch with Lansbury (actually only three years older than Harvey) doing the best work of her career (albeit in a somewhat small role). Laurence Harvey's tortured character is also a sight to behold. It is an immensely interesting role that keeps the whole production glued together. Harvey, an actor I really never thought had much talent, proves that when everything else is working well that he can be a reputable performer. And of course Sinatra is solid as he always was throughout a film career that hit its peak from about 1950 through 1965. Once again he adds a certain depth and an amazing complexity to an already rich role. Smart, stylish, at times nasty and always impressive, "The Manchurian Candidate" is one of those pictures that continues to be a fixture in the American cinema as time goes by. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into "The Manchurian Candidate" without knowing too much about the movie itself. I knew about its critical acclaim, but I was unfamiliar with the plot. Regardless, when I rented and watched the film, I had high expectations. I was not disappointed either.The plot revolves around the strange case of Raymond Shaw, a sergeant who wins the Congressional Medal of Honor for his bravery in the cold war. Two of the men in his company, however, have strange nightmares that suggest Raymond is not as deserving of the award as he seems. One of these men, Major Bennet Marco, led on by these recurring nightmares, unravels a sinister Communist plot. Set against the cold war paranoia of the sixties and McCarthyism, "The Manchurian Candidate" does an excellent job of recreating the intense suspense and tension of the time.The acting in this film is superb. A great script is heightened by excellent acting in this movie. It's hard not to like Frank Sinatra in his role as Marco, who is the protagonist. Laurence Harvey as Raymond does a good job showing us a character that is wholly unlikable and snobby, yet pathetic and sad at the same time. And of course, Angela Lansbury in her role as Raymond's malicious and plotting mother is excellent.Some stand-out scenes in the film were the nightmare sequences that brilliantly interlaced dream and reality, the all-queen solitaire game with Marco and Raymond, and the supremely tense climax at the political convention. The cinematography in the movie was very well done as action, romance, and tension all mixed together smoothly. All the scenes managed to keep my attention and kept me wondering what was going to happen next. As a thriller, the film works remarkably well, and it is quite easily the best political thriller I've seen to date.Keeping me from giving the movie a perfect ten are one or two little nagging problems. I wasn't a big fan of the music for the movie, and it even disrupted the mood for me at one point in the film. It was okay, just not great. Also, the whole plot is sort of unlikely. I wont go into it here, but I don't think that the Communist plan for world domination would fall into the hands of one relatively uncontrolled person, no matter how well trained his mind was. That's just my opinion, however.The movie is sort of long, and isn't exactly action packed, but it is very interesting, insightful, and even chilling. I had a great time watching it, and I definitely recommend it if you are interested at all in seeing a gripping Cold War era political thriller. Besides, the cultural relevance of the film alone is enough to see it.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember seeing The Manchurian Candidate as a teen back in the day in theaters. Good thing I saw it too because after the Kennedy assassination it was withdrawn from circulation. I then got to see it again in the theater when it got a re-premiere back in the late eighties.For those who believe that conspiracies control the world, this film is for you. The ultra-right has a game plan to take over, the international communist conspiracy is given life and credence in this film and there's one character here who's got a conspiracy to beat all.When The Manchurian Candidate first came out the theater owners were instructed not to seat anyone if they came after the first 10 minutes of the film. If you buy the video or DVD, fast forward it about 10 minutes and try to pick it up from there. It won't make any sense, I guarantee.A platoon led by Captain Frank Sinatra and Sergeant Lawrence Harvey is betrayed by their Korean guide, Henry Silva, and captured by Chinese Communists. They are flown to Manchuria where Russian scientists from the Pavlov Institute experiment with revolutionary techniques in the newly developed science of brainwashing. Minus two men who are killed, the patrol is taken back to Korea where all of them have been implanted with a story about how Harvey saved the rest of them and led them back through enemy lines to UN lines.As for Harvey, he's the one who actually killed the two soldiers and he is now a brainwashed assassin ready to do the bidding of his handlers. Harvey is the son of Angela Lansbury who is in a role that's ten galaxies from Jessica Fletcher. She's the rich wife who is the brains and money behind her second husband James Gregory. Gregory is a Joe McCarthy like Senator who is forever yelling about Communists in every nook and cranny. He's a buffoon, but he's actually not aware of how right and how organized they are in The Manchurian Candidate.Gregory and director John Frankenheimer caught one aspect of McCarthy's persona in his role. McCarthy never took any of this seriously. There are many stories about him performing for the TV cameras and the press and when they were away offering to buy a round of drinks for the same person he might have been denouncing as a traitor minutes earlier. The difference between McCarthy in real life and Gregory in this film is that McCarthy had no manager and no real ambitions other than to retain his Senate seat. Gregory if anything is managed.Frank Sinatra in having The Manchurian Candidate withdrawn robbed fans of one of his best screen performances. Only in one scene when he refers to someone as a 'cat' does he slip into the hipster Rat Pack image. Sinatra is the one who starts to unravel everyone's plans because of the recurring dreams he's having about what really happened in Korea.On the way to New York to question Harvey about it, Sinatra meets Janet Leigh who really doesn't have a role crucial to the story, but functions as an Alfred Hitchcock type cool blond. With what little she has to do, Leigh does well.Lawrence Harvey is the key here. He's really a weakling and that's the key to the story. He was carefully chosen to be the manipulated assassin because of his inability to break from Mom's iron grip. Of course there have been few screen moms as evil as Angela Lansbury. She and Gregory really own this film and Angela blows everyone else off the screen when she's on. For her mesmerizing performance I recommend The Manchurian Candidate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Finest Movies of Its Genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Still one of the finest movies of its genre, this original film version of "The Manchurian Candidate" features excellent atmosphere, memorable characters, and a first-rate cast. John Frankenheimer's direction shows a very good understanding of the material and its potential, and indeed it is a rare example of a top quality movie being made from an average novel, rather than the other way around.Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey carry the bulk of the movie, as former members of the same military unit in Korea, who slowly learn the truth about their shared past. Both give fine performances, with Sinatra's character perpetually nervous and fearful of what he will find, yet compelled to get at the truth, while Harvey as Sergeant Shaw is coldly self-composed, and contemptuous of anyone else's weakness.The supporting cast is also excellent. Angela Lansbury's icy presence as Shaw's mother is unforgettable, Janet Leigh makes an intriguing woman of mystery, and James Gregory is flawless as a pestilential, brainless Senator. Khigh Dhiegh also has some fine moments of refined cruelty as evil mastermind Yen Lo.Some of the finest scenes come from the dream sequences, which are crafted very well from a technical viewpoint, and which also ring true with the story as it comes out. They produce some chilling moments, as well as making the plot concept - which in itself is pretty far- fetched - seem more believable.With the passage of time and the dissolution of Cold War tensions, it's now possible to watch this without any political baggage, and to allow the excellent production to stand on its own high quality, rather than on any contemporary sentiments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>During the Korean War, an American platoon is kidnapped by the North Koreans. When they return, one of them (Laurence Harvey) appears to be acting strangely. As the story progresses, it becomes clear that the enemy did something to him, possibly to the point where they might still be in complete control of him.Admittedly, "The Manchurian Candidate" is basically a Red Scare movie, but it's different in that it doesn't simply follow the silly story of the Commies invading a Norman Rockwell-style town. The movie's focus is what the audience doesn't know. Not to mention the top-notch performances from Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury and John McGiver. Interestingly, the 2004 remake actually managed to be as good as the original. Ten out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manchurian Candidate is, quite simply, the best political thriller of all time. I can't think of another that keeps me on the edge of my seat, even on the tenth viewing. The incredible script, Angela Lansbury's Dearest Mommy, the effective use of black &amp; white film for a movie about issues that were anything but black &amp; white--I could go on and on.I know that most people rave about Ms. Lansbury above all the other cast members, but--for me--Frank Sinatra wins the prize hands down. His disbelief, and then his disillusionment, and then his despair are perfectly portrayed. There were really two Sinatras, the singer AND the great actor.In watching The Manchurian Candidate again and again, I never cease to be amazed at its prescient theme, the danger of the combination of fanaticism and patriotic fervor. Goldwater's famous quote comes to mind, "Extremism in the defense of virtue is no vice". In my opinion, this film just gets better with age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An unusual film for its time, this movie from Richard Condon's novel about Soviet conspiracies and brainwashing in the Korean war is a little too far fetched to believe.Director John Frankenheimer creates an air of mystery at the beginning, but fails to maintain it as the plot gives itself away. Perhaps our director felt he would lose too many people if he did not hastily explain what was happening.Performances from Angela Lansbury, Janet Leigh, Frank Sinatra and especially Laurence Harvey (as the would be assassin) are good, but they alone are not enough to save this motion picture.Wednesday, August 12, 1992 - Video</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amid seemingly endless acclaim, I ventured into this film believing I was about to see a film worthy of being in the IFC's top 100. Rarely am I ever this disappointed.The pacing of this movie is slow, slower and arduously slower still. The plot unfolds at a snail's pace with backstory. The acting is rigid and wooden, a trait with which although I am accustomed unfortunately was on this occasion yet another sign of the film's age. I found the characters to be distant and unrelatable, however this works in favor of Angela Lansbury's character because that's exactly how she is supposed to be.The plot is contrived, and reeks not only with Cold War paranoia of communists abroad, but the "subversive" right wing hard-liners at home set out to put all of Hollywood in forced labor camps as "Sen. John Iselin" and his "Iselinism" is a painfully obvious attack on Joe McCarthy.Outside of the premise, there was little interesting or endearing about this movie. I almost enjoyed the dream sequences as they reminded me of something from a Stanley Kubric film, and the feel and look of the movie vaguely reminded me of Dr. Strangelove from time to time, but overall I found it dreadfully boring, poorly acted and altogether far-fetched. I can honestly say that if I never saw this film again, I'd feel no regret.</fullReview>

Then I watched it and after a few minutes I thought I must have the wrong film. What I was watching was a movie with an silly and unbelievable story, some truly terrible dialogue badly acted and told in a slow moving rather tedious and predictable way. I'll admit Angela Lansbury was good but nearly everyone else wasn't. I can't believe this was considered good even forty years ago!

		<fullReview>I don't understand the swooning adoration of this movie. I picked it up last night on the sole basis of it being a cultural iconic movie - one which everyone has seen and is universally acclaimed as great. I had no familiarity with the plot other than the description on the DVD box, but I wanted a sure fire movie that I wasn't going to regret renting.Well I can't say I regret renting it, but is this movie hokey or what?*** Spoilers below ? ***The dream sequence was unquestionably great. I loved it and was entirely willing to suspend my disbelief to allow the movie to tell it's story.Where it started to fall apart for me is when Sinatra is ordered to take sick leave. Give me a break with the train scene and Janet Leigh. Here we see a sweaty, vacant eyed, spastic middle-aged man, who can't even light a cigarette in front of a pretty girl. Now I never tried that ploy before, but it apparently worked for Janet because she can't wait to follow Franky out of the car and give him her home address, telephone number and where she works. Maybe guys who sweat, shake and talk without looking you in the eye once during the conversation appeal to some women, but I doubt that the technique would work well today.Equally as inane as the train scene is cab scene after the police station pickup. Janet explains to Sinatra that as soon as she got home after meeting sweaty Frank, the first thing she did was to tell her Fiance that their engagement was over. The girl was obviously smitten.Almost as unbelievable is the snakebite sequence where Lesley Parrish fortunately has brought along a supply of razor blades during her bike ride, so as to come to the aid of Harvey after his incident. I have no problem however with her removing her blouse to fashion an improvised tourniquet.One of my favorite parts of the movie was what must have been one of the first movie Kung-Fu action scenes ever filmed, when Frank takes on the yellow peril with oriental fighting techniques he obviously picked up in Korea.Aside from a few highlights in the movie: the dream sequence, blouse removal and kung-fu segments, I seldom found myself 'riveted to my seat'. It was pretty obvious to me WHO Harvey was going to kill and when - well ahead of the actual killings. Trite and hokey - yes. Suspenseful? Nah.*** Spoilers over ***I can't say this was a terrible movie, but for me it sure wasn't a great one. It made me think of a Sinatra version of an Elvis movie - where the star vehicle is more important than any significant plot or character development.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An eerie fact is that a film dealing with the assassination of a presidential candidate came out just shortly before the real-life assassination of President John F. Kennedy.LAURENCE HARVEY always had a rather sleep-walker kind of expression on his unlined face and here it serves him well as a man who has been hypnotized (brainwashed is a better word) into believing that he must kill the next presidential candidate of the U.S. because his mama wants him to.Mama is ANGELA LANSBURY, in probably the wickedest role of her long career. She soothingly explains to the transfixed Harvey exactly at what point during the ceremony he must take aim at his target--and kill. It's the most chilling scene in the movie, except for the finale which is really spellbinding, as it takes place in a crowded Madison Square Garden with FRANK SINATRA hot on the trail of the would-be killer.Sinatra's almost immediate discovery is what throws reality off a bit at this point. He sees a pinpoint of light in the far distance and knows exactly which stairway, which exit, which floor to go to in a matter of seconds. Well, it's called taking dramatic license for the sake of art, I suppose.All in all, a very chilling reminder of the time Americans were living through in the McCarthy era, only occasionally flawed by distracting things like the love interest for Sinatra (JANET LEIGH) in a totally unnecessary sub-plot that does nothing to further the action.John Frankenheimer gets every ounce of suspense out of pivotal scenes and you'll find yourself on the edge of your seat as the final scene unfolds.A final word about the performances: ANGELA LANSBURY has never been more mesmerizing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is an offbeat political thriller which tells the story of an elaborate plot to assassinate an American presidential candidate. Bizarrely, the people who jointly devise the plan are a group of very powerful communists and the wife of a right wing U.S. politician. Furthermore, the assassin is a brainwashed Korean War veteran who happens to be the son of the American conspirator! The fact that this all sounds a bit far-fetched is completely intentional as this movie is wonderfully satirical, full of black humour and very effective in portraying the politicians, whether they're communists or McCarthyites as being equally evil and ridiculous.George Axelrod's screenplay is based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel and the tensions of the Cold War period are captured very successfully in the story which, at the time of the movie's release, was clearly both original and controversial. The significance of brainwashing in the plot is redolent of the era in which the book was written but in retrospect, the way in which the assassination was to be carried out looked prescient, as it was strikingly similar to the way in which President John Kennedy was killed in the year following the movie's release.During the Korean War, a platoon of American soldiers is captured by Chinese Communists who take the men to Manchuria where they're subjected to a variety of mind control techniques. When the men return to the United States, Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is awarded the Congessional Medal Of Honor for bravely saving the lives of most of the men in his platoon.Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) who had been the platoon's commander in Korea suffers recurring nightmares which make him suspect that he and his men had been brainwashed and that the official account of Shaw's exploits may not be accurate. The torment he suffers because of these dreams leads him to undertake an investigation to find out the truth.Mrs Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury) is Raymond's overbearing mother who's now married to Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory). He's a Vice Presidential candidate, a politician who makes a lot of noise without saying anything of any substance and a man who indulges in a great deal of anti-communist rhetoric. Mrs Iselin is a communist agent who's working on a plan to deliver the presidency to her husband so that the United States can then be brought under communist control. She's also the person who's responsible for activating the brainwashed Raymond when it becomes necessary for him to carry out an assassination.Raymond is a cold character who was disliked by the men in his platoon and yet when asked about him they automatically reply by saying that "Raymond Shaw is the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life". In fact, he hates his mother and his stepfather vehemently and is totally unaware that he's been programmed to be an assassin.Major Marco's investigation reveals the significance that a playing card (the Queen of Diamonds) has in stimulating Raymond into action when he's required to shoot someone and he then uses a pack full of these cards to try to nullify Raymond's response to this trigger. It's uncertain how effective Marco's action has been until Mrs Iselin primes Raymond to assassinate her husband's party's Presidential Candidate so that Senator Iselin will then be called upon to take on the role of his murdered colleague.Laurence Harvey's demeanour and way of talking emphasise his character's lack of warmth and spontaneity and make him convincing as someone who's functioning in some kind of hypnotic state. Frank Sinatra is impressive in conveying Marco's combination of confusion, despair and anxiety and Angela Lansbury excels as an incredibly evil woman who's ruthless, manipulative and very controlling. Her son's emotional development had undoubtedly been harmed by her domineering behaviour and in one of her most egregious actions she even used him to kill a political opponent and his daughter who happened to be the only woman that Raymond had ever loved."The Manchurian Candidate" was not a great commercial success when it was first released and it was then rarely seen for a period of nearly 25 years. The success and appreciation that it's gained in the years since is attributable to its intrinsic quality and its wonderful blend of humour, intelligence and edginess rather than the cachet that it unquestionably gained from being out of circulation for such a long time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Was Probably Good For The Time Period</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those films made in the era when Hollywood preferred using Caucasian, and sometimes Hispanic, actors with lots of makeup to play Asian or Arab characters. In this case it was a Puerto Rican playing a Korean.I can't think of an actor that "acts" more than Frank Sinatra. It's just too bad he can't do it better.Notwithstanding the poor casting and bad acting, it's an intriguing story that is told much better in the remake. I know there are many people that are loyal to the original version, and I'm sure it was a very good film during the time period in which it was released.Fortunately, the story is different enough in the remake that it is worth seeing, even you have seen this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best political thriller ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate is the first and best political thriller ever made, and a movie that will never take it's place. The movie tells a story I would never would have known that was put onto film and that was the story of a former Korean War POW (played by Laurence Harvey.) who gets brainwashed by communists and becomes an assassin when his fellow officer Major Bennett Marco (played by Frank Sinatra). Frankenheimer is very interesting with his visions that he wanted to put onto the screen during his career as a director one of them including this masterpiece. For this movie I really thought that the movie deserved more Oscar nominations than the only two it got especially for Sinatra and Harvey for their equally wonderful work, which this is Sinatra's best work since his Oscar winning turn for From here to Eternity. This is certainly one of the greatest movie i have seen in a long time and i am completely looking forward to seeing this masterwork again cause of it's greatness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Manchurian Candidate..Is it happening here? Could it happen here?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a big plot surprise in this movie. You do get hints..which you will see on your second viewing. But I'm holding my cards close---and will not show my hand...and tell you.As other reviewers note, the leads in this film are potent. Frank Sinatra (who was a backer of this film) is great as the PTSD before we knew he had PTSD military officer...who has to "handle" the problem of the senator's stepson...played well by Laurence Harvey.Janet Leigh talks piffle to Sinatra...somehow sensing her babbling will soothe his war-induced stress. She then gives real support to Sinatra, showing her character's substance...as Sinatra works to cure another...and himself...and figure out why their distress is connected to each other and to national security. Sinatra must figure out why he and some similarly stressed former military companions have the same dream...and what that dream has to do with...the US Presidency!If you wonder "Why haven't I heard of this good movie before?"...Frank Sinatra pulled it and put it away for several years...because of a real life distressing event which hit the US shortly after this film's release. (Can't tell ya...it's a partial spoiler).Well worth your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even After 50 Years, It's Still The Best Political Thriller Out There</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are simply not enough letters in the Summary to cover what this movie achieves. Angela Lansbury, in an interview on the DVD, says that everyone (all the actors) has at least one great scene in the movie. I would go a bit further than that and say everyone has great scenes...all of them. That is near to impossible to do, but John Frankenhemier did it.Quick Note: If you are watching on the DVD, absolutely DO NOT watch the interviews or specials before watching the movie; they are filled with spoilers! This is considered by many to be Frank Sinatra's best movie; I agree. I'm not a fan of Frank, but he gives a very deep and believable performance in this picture. He also was instrumental behind the scenes in getting the picture made. John Frankenheimer says so in an interview, with George Axelrod's agreement and Angela Lansbury also says she wasn't aware of Frank's crucial efforts at the time, but indicates she is now (1988).Be prepared to watch all the way through, at least once. If you must take a kitchen or bathroom break, pause the movie. The suspense and tension, maintained throughout, come from several sources, but chief among them is that very little is explained before it happens. In many ways, you learn at the same time as the characters.And yes, there is a twist in the climax, so don't blink. Just an excellent movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Classic Remains Relevant Today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a Cold War political thriller film that features Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh and Angela Lansbury, together with Henry Silva, James Gregory, Leslie Parrish and John McGiver. It was directed by John Frankenheimer from an adaptation by George Axelrod of Richard Condon's novel.The central concept of the film is that the son of a prominent, right-wing political family has been brainwashed as an unwitting assassin for an international Communist conspiracy.The film opens with a group of soldiers whooping it up in a bar in Korea as their commander, Sgt. Raymond Shaw, arrives to inform them that they're back on duty. These men obviously have no fondness for Shaw, and he feels no empathy for them. While on patrol, Shaw and his platoon are ambushed by Korean troops. Months later, Shaw is receiving a hero's welcome as he returns to the United States to accept the Congressional Medal of Honor, and several of the soldiers who served under Shaw repeatedly refer to him as "the bravest, finest, most lovable man I ever met." It soon becomes evident that after their capture by the Koreans, Shaw and his men were subjected to an intense program of brainwashing prior to their release. While several are troubled by bad dreams and inexplicable behavior, it's Capt. Bennett Marco, who seems the most haunted by the experience. In time, Marco is able to piece together what happened; it seems Raymond Shaw was programmed by a shadowy cadre of Russian and Chinese agents into a killing machine who will assassinate anyone, even a close friend, when given the proper commands. On the other side of the coin, Shaw is also used for political gain by his harridan mother, who guides the career of her second husband, John Iselin, a bone-headed congressman hoping to win the vice-presidential nomination through a campaign of anti-Communist hysteria.The movie is truly an excellent and brilliant film.No question about it.First of all,it features a host of remarkable performances, several from actors cast cleverly against type particularly Frank Sinatra's edgy, aggressive turn as Marco may be the finest dramatic work of his movie career.Axelrod's screenplay is by turns compelling, witty, and horrifying in its implications, and Frankenheimer's direction milks it for all the tension it can muster.This is one rare film that comes along that works in all departments, with story, production and performance so well blended that the end effect is one of nearly complete satisfaction.Finally,it was entertaining yet unsettling as it was truly ahead of its time and it has a resonance that still echoes uncomfortably in the present.This classic blend of satire and political thriller that was uncomfortably prescient in its own time when it was theatrically released in the 60's remains distressingly relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most frightening political thrillers of cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a splendid film in total, a provocatively relevant thriller. The film is all in all, one of the first to take on the risky subject of mind control and this one remains one of the best in that genre. Used in surreal effect, the film builds for us an air of bizarre mystery, we are shocked not by what is seen on-screen, but the proposition of the film altogether. That is what makes this film more effective, it is not gruesome, but its notions to mind control and government coverts are as frightening today as they were fifty years ago. In perspective, the film acts as a commentary on American and korean politics while providing a shockingly relevant thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A ticking time bomb that has a few explosions along the way.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are moments of this film that, no matter how many times you've seen it, will leave you with chills. The subject matter-brain washing-is horrifying, and the agenda is pure evil. The early 60's was a political circus, with communism, the aftermath of Korea, the Cuban Missle Crisis, Civil Rights, etc., so a movie with serious subject matter like this was not just daring, but a must to tell audiences what could happen if they didn't wake up and smell the Chock Full O'Nuts.There are so many moments of poignancy, particularly for me the speech of the presidential nominee, very close to a speech that JFK made which is still quoted today. As the victim of Communists and surrounding elements, most viciously his mother, Laurence Harvey is brilliant, going from a cold, unfeeling veteran of the Korean war to an unrequited hero who must instantaneously make a drastic decision to prevent political disaster. Sinatra, in the most important film he ever appeared in (as well as one he produced), goes through a plethora of emotions, both hating and helping Harvey at the same time as he begins to see the evil which is about to swallow Harvey up like a demon in Dante's Inferno. The scene where Harvey begins to feel joy over having made a joke (he's happy so therefore he can be lovable) is quite touching.As Harvey's joke of a stepfather, James Gregory is excellent proving that idiocy can be more dangerous than intelligence. And if you want to see the most evil mother in movie history, look no further. Angela Lansbury here is presented as the Bride of Satan who is actually more powerful than her husband. Her almost incestuous love for her son (Harvey) reveals an evil so innate, no exorcism could get rid of it. Her performance is so rich it is like she took her character of the newspaper owner from "State of the Union" (power hungry but not sinister) and mixed it with a bit of "I Claudius's" Livia.Janet Leigh is the least flamboyant on screen as Sinatra's love interest, but somehow, she manages to make the part rise above what could have been totally inconsequential. The scene between train cars with Leigh and Sinatra is brilliantly acted as if it were really happening, not staged by director John Frankenheimer. As Lansbury's hated rival, John McGiver is almost angelic, and the shot of him standing in front of the large wing-spread eagle is one of the great photographic metaphors of film history. As his sweet daughter, Leslie Parrish ("Li'l Abner") manages to avoid being cloying. Henry Silva's portrayal of Harvey's valet can only be compared to the character of Billie Whitelaw in "The Omen".This is the type of movie that while not quite flawless is nevertheless brilliant. From the nightmares of the two marines recalling incidents from the war through the Democratic presidential convention at Madison Square Garden in the finale, there is no time for boredom. Try not to flinch the next time you're playing solitaire and come upon the Queen of Diamonds. Just don't get the urge to dive into the lake at Central Park's Bethesda Terrace.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bravura Masterpiece With Sharp Insight and Prognostication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our Political and Media landscape Changes quite rapidly with the advent of Technology. Its Metamorphoses is at light speed due to its Power and is assimilated gladly by the giddy Populace. Since this Film has strong elements of both, there is some criticism about the Dated aspects of these Systems.The Mind Control Conspiracies were just being revealed during the Cold War and this was Cutting Edge stuff to its contemporary Audiences. No one ever heard of MK-Ultra in 1962. Political Assassinations were an Absent Topic at that Time but just wait a Year or so and those will come with rapid, Lone Nut Assassin, Fire.The Communists in the Government Scare from the Previous Decade wasn't going away and was still On the Minds of Many. Just ask the John Birch Society.There are some heavily Criticized Scenes that seem rushed and forced but these involve Love Interest and are hardly what this Film was about. So the two side Stories of Romance are unnecessary but are so little in a Movie with so much Creative and Hard Edged Filmmaking that it hardly mattered and is nit-picky.Viewed objectively and in the Proper Spirit, this is a Bravura Masterpiece and a sharply honest Insight and a Prognostication of things to come as well as the way things were.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate", based on a novel of the same name (written by Richard Condon) is one of the finest political thrillers out there.An American Platoon is captured by the Soviets. They are all taken to Manchuria in Communist China and are subjected to a series of 'brainwashing' experiments for some political motive, the nature of which is made clear only as the film progresses. Revealing anything more would be sacrilege. This shocking picture has to be seen to be believed.Laurence Harvey stars as Raymond Shaw, the central character who is the 'chosen one' in this political conspiracy. Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury star in supporting roles along with some others. All of them deliver fine performances in this tragic tale of deceit and corruption.John Frankenheimer does a brilliant job of directing and makes sure there is not a single dull moment, gets some of the best acting done from his cast, shoots some of the most memorable sequences ever filmed in cinema and takes the movie to a very satisfying conclusion.This unique film deserves to be seen over and over again and holds tremendous repeat value.

		<fullReview>Bold political thriller on the mind control of the prisoners Americans in the Korean war. With an excellent script and splendid narrative rhythm , the film raises a disturbing theory, that only a year later surprised with the fabric on the death of President Kennedy. The end of the shooting coincided with his murder, and therefore the film premiered years later. In the year 2004 was a "remake" starring Denzel Washington. In 1962, Frank Sinatra protagonist "The Manchurian Candidate"; film that we talk about experiments applied to soldiers to modify behavior patterns. The need John Frankenheimer a producer for its realization, appeared excited Frank Siantra with a script of "The Manchurian Candidate," which could have a role as an officer of the bunch of prisoners Americans, Sinatra was formed as co-producer and introduced the idea before the president of "United Artists". It was rejected because they believed that the draft was politically dangerous, because senators were killed and a criticism of the army by the granting of rigged the Medal of Honor of the Congress. Then Sinatra met with his friend the president John F. Kenndy, recently elected, and got his approval In 1963, he was killed John F. Kennedy, some of the presidents more charismatic that has taken us, and "The Manchurian Candidate" had to postpone its premiere until 1965. Years later, in 1988, Frank Sinatra momentum the re-release of this film, by its relevance and thematic environment to the political environment.In the 1987 "The Manchurian Candidate "was presented as a sample retrospective at the "New York Film Festival", causing new criticism and a new launch in London, 25 years after its premiere.Its director John Frankenheimer we performed a film strange for several reasons, is filmed in black and white where dominated by the colour, mentions dreams of type "Freudian" of the Noir Cinema of the 1940, and the time very modern with a very television. It should be emphasized the violent and fantastic scene of the American soldiers with the alleged ladies in the Convention on plants when in fact they are before members of the communist party Russian and Chinese. All this makes this film a small jewel of the cinema because it is still being 1962 links with the cinema of the previous decades and anticipates the thriller of the 70 and 80.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not read the novel, though I may very well consider it. I understand that this is one of Frankenheimer's best, and I see why. It's arguably easier to enjoy this if you can ignore the demonizing and political overtones, but if you consider when this was made, it's to be expected. While the story-telling can be a tad... all over the place at points(it especially seems to struggle at the very beginning), the plot is excellent and rather compelling, from start to finish. The pacing is good, and you're never bored during this. There are great surprises and twists in this, and it is exciting and engaging. The editing and cinematography are impeccable. Acting is marvelous, Sinatra, Harvey, Leigh and Lansbury are spot-on. Every role is well-cast, and the characters are interesting, credible and consistent. Tension is skillfully built up, and this takes something that could easily have come off as silly and manages to render it as unforgettably creepy. There is a little violence and even less blood in this; however, the entire concept is quite disturbing. I recommend this to anyone who likes the idea of it, and/or is a fan of someone who took part in making it. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mind-blowing conspiracy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently saw this movie on TV after reading various enthusiastic reviews and trying to find the DVD for over a year. I have to say it was worth waiting a year to see this particular, amazing film. John Frankenheimer made what is with no doubt one of the finest thrillers in cinema history: Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) has recurring nightmares about a mission in Korea two years earlier. But what happened during that mission? And what's all that got to do with war hero Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), his mother (Angela Lansbury) and some political murders?Like Alfred Hitchcock, Frankenheimer manages to create tension with everyday stuff (a solitaire game has never looked so unsettling), depicting a bizarre yet utterly realistic conspiracy (the nightmare sequence and the shocking climax are breathtaking and impossible to forget). He also directs an amazing actor-threesome: Sinatra is perfectly convincing as Marco, and Angela Lansbury is... well, just perfect! But it's Harvey who deserves more attention: he's chillingly superb as the conflicted, almost android-like Raymond...New to Frankenheimer, conspiracy flicks or great '60s thrillers? The Manchurian Candidate is an excellent way to begin the acquaintance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen many great movies, and The Manchurian Candidate is one of them. No, scratch that, an amazing movie, and for me one of the best of the 60s. There are so many good things about it that I'd be here all night listing them. The cinematography is dazzling, while the script is just excellent, very sophisticated and thought provoking. The direction is very taut with a hard edge, while the story is superbly constructed. I also loved The Manchurian Candidate's atmosphere, it never fails to thrill, chill and provoke, and while the film is just over 2 hours it never bored me. The acting is brilliant, the characters are interesting and surprisingly complex. We have Laurence Harvey who is perfectly cast as repressed Shaw and we have Frank Sinatra in one of his best roles as tormented Marco. But it is Angela Lansbury's unforgettable performance as Raymond's mother lives long in the memory, truly monstrous and manipulative in character and Lansbury acted brilliantly. All in all, just an extraordinary film, with a spellbinding finale, and better I think than its dull and convoluted remake. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a great deal of durability to this film. First, the conspiracy aspects continue to remain plausible, perhaps more so today. There are many who feel this film portended, or perhaps patterned, Kennedy's assassination. Others who see John Iselin as a crafty Nixon-type, or a buffoonish Bush-alike. Still others see Angela Lansbury's character as Hilary Clinton, concocting world domination. The idea of the "red menace," played to the hilt (perhaps overly-so, even for 1962), has its modern-day parallels in our views of terrorists, and the brainwashing techniques conjure up images, at least here, of suicide bombers. Second, the acting is impeccable. I replay this movie expecting to see a crack in Laurence Harvey's mannerisms, or some sly nuance to Sinatra's demeanor, but there is none. Angela Lansbury is perfect in her role as the queen hornet, and the supporting cast hands us pearls as well. Third, the writing. While there are a few objections to logic, such as Eugenie's (Janet Leigh) impetuousness, the main framework is really quite flawless. The background and reasons for Raymond's company's abduction, and the use of Raymond, all makes sense. The brainwashing techniques have not been undermined. The political scheme is brilliant. The subplots are developed without becoming clunky or puzzling. As well, the fervor and fluidity of the screenplay is obvious without pandering. Quite astounding, really. Fourth, direction. All of the aspects of good film-making are here, for use in classrooms, if you will. Lighting, camera angles, editing techniques- it all clicks. I have a hard time delivering a less-than-perfect score.</fullReview>

Shaw's domineering mother (Angela Lansbury)is married to Senator John Iselin(James Gregory)and has big plans for her husband as well as her highly decorated war hero son. The cold war is now set to explode like a slow fused time-bomb by way of a complex Oedipal assassination plot. The Communists could actually manipulate America's political process by having their own kind in the White House. It is important for Marco to cleanse the brainwashed Shaw.

		<fullReview>A fantastic film with spooky relevance to the latter day activities of Dubya and Dick... HOWEVER, if you read any of the other comments almost all pick up on the strangely disjointed role of Janet Leigh.There is a giveaway during her dialogue with Sinatra's character (Mjr Marco) on the train, which suggests that in the original plot Leigh's character (Eugenie Rose Chaney) was actually the evil Dr. Yen Lo? or to be more accurate was what Mjr Marco had been hypnotized into visualising Dr Yen Lo as.It's not just Leigh/Rosie's comment about being one of the "original Chinese workmen who laid the track on this stretch" of railway, but also at her attempt at a joke - "Are you in the railroad business?" "Not anymore? when you asked that question, you should have asked 'are you in the railroad line?'" - that would seem to parallel Dr Yen's humour, which has already been very carefully established by this point in the film.Imagine the final scene as Marco bitterly adds his own citation to that of Major Shaw's hypnotized men, except this time that camera pans back to Leigh/Rosie, only to find that the hero of the film has also been brainwashed and is being controlled by Dr Yen.Imagine also in the early 60's that the idea of Sinatra kissing and proposing to a Chinese man with a mustache might have been a little too much for someone with a decisive say in the final cut!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Was Warned About People Like This!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You have to realize the full extent of how the monster of Communist paranoia prevailed in our American culture after World War II!! The nation's cold war conditions, which stalemated America's citizens with needless trepidation, necessitated that Americans manufacture an adversarial enemy. Such a scenario was established irregardless of the fact that our nation's peoples could find a legitimate enemy or not!! Lawrence Harvey is magnificent in this role, as he exudes a helplessness that exaggerates the intensity of tumultuousness which every one around him has become burdened by!! Angela Lansbury plays Raymond's mother, she has all the free flowing compassion of a refrigeration plant... Her personality is less pleasant than a largess of lagoon algae!! This is an instance where manipulation becomes intrepidly criminal!! Being hypnotically mesmerized ultimately backfires in this movie!!! Major Bennett Marco, (Frank Sinatra's character), must endure the unfortunate task of being the hapless recipient to witnessing an onslaught of heinous ordeals in Raymond's tormented life!! Back in 1962, when this film came out, it brought on a myriad of emotional complexities which had not been delved into until this movie brought them out!! Angela Lansbury's character was one which far exceeded the label of right wing Conservative!! She manifested a personality which was overtly lethal, and, her temperament contained an unmitigated temerity for the slightest concept which advocated even a modicum of non-conventionalism!! I was warned about people like she was!! The vitriolic rancor with the major characters in this movie was predicated on the paucity of trust each and every one of them had for the existing circumstances!! Nothing was simple anymore, war and hypnosis were an ephemeral obsession with Raymond, these tales of agitation resulted in the fact that he no longer possessed the ability to think rationally!! New York City has always been a playground for the counter-culture elements of our society to breed and proliferate!! At one time, rumors were going around about how there were more KGB agents in Manhattan, than there were in Moscow!! Such a venue, like New York, induced an undaunted ambiguity with relation to the motives of any individual embracing one political philosophy or another!! At some point, however, what constitutes a warranted concern, as opposed to what is an invalid concern, should have been dichotomized accordingly!!! The film "Manchurian Candidate" is indeed one of the finest films ever made!! The candid responses that this movie makes provision for, bring on the potential to utterly sensitize the movie audience with regard to the film's formidable aspects of ideological extremism!! This website ranks "Manchurian Candidate" the 95th best picture out of the top 250 films in the cinema!! AFI (American Film Institute) ranks this film 65th best film out of the top 100 American films ever made!! The introverted belligerence was superbly depicted with this movie, and the political rumination for the film's justifiable ending sparked a seriously pontificating insight for the rationale of cold war phobia!! Ultimately, man's primate instincts, for which he gets severely stigmatized by, sadly resonated with almost every one of the major characters in this film!! "Manchurian Candidate" was a harbinger of things to come in the political arena, as it illustrates how people who sought political office demonstrated a repugnant display of greed!! I definitely feel that this movie, "Manchurian Candidate" is head and shoulders above most films, particularly in terms of this movie's astute correlation to the complicated storyline in which it presented!! "Manchurian Candidate" deliberately articulates a disconcerting premise to the gist of their plot with a very painstaking brilliance!! Based on the novel by Richard Condon, this movie explodes with top notch Hollywood talent!! John Frankenheimer directs "Manchurian Candidate" ( He is well known for a numerous list of "Playhouse 90" productions), Frankenheimer does a marvelous job with this movie!! The acting for "Manchurian Candidate" is sensational!! Frank Sinatra was a box office big wig at the time, and Angela Lansbury plays a character who is absolutely despicable!! Of course, this was the idea!! The '2004 remake of this movie is just mediocre, a little too stilted!! However, I give the original '1962 movie a PERFECT TEN!!! SEE IT FOR SURE!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How good is this movie? You do not have words for how good this movie is. No, no, you do not. However, for your benefit I will run down a brief list of what makes this movie kick 59,042 @sses.1. SINATRA DOES KARATE!!! - Everyone who sees this for the first time winces. It's surprisingly intense. But also, somehow hilarious.2. SHAMEFULLY RACIST!!! - I mean, not for nothing, but "Smiling like Fu Manchu"? "Ching Chong Chow or whatever your name is?" Still, this does an amazing job of putting the film in historical context, which is what it's all about. Plus one of the best characters in the film is the Manchurian 'trainer'.3. 360 DEGREE SHOT!!! - And then the set changes! How do they do it?! Watch and marvel!4. FREUDIAN PSYCHOLOGY!!! - You thought it was dead. You thought it was debunked. Well, not in Hollywood, baby! Hypnotism, subconscious and unconscious minds, and of course, obsessive hatred of one's mother and its psychological implications.5. AWESOME DOCUMENTARY STYLE!!! - This film's photographic style is super! Watch the scene where John Iselin first confronts the senator. Tell me that's not AWESOME! Oh, right, you can't, because if you did I would KARATE-CHOP you Sinatra style! Tiger paw, Frank.6. SINATRA ONLY DOES ONE TAKE!!! - So everything is out of focus and crazy! So very cool!7. ANGELA LANSBURY!!! - INCEEEEEEEEEEEST!8. THE SCORE!!! - David Amram writes a simply great classical/modern score for this film, which you can't stop humming in all its atonal glory.In conclusion. this film is FREAKIN AWESOME! Get a copy! Or five! Send John Frankenheimer a thank-you letter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics Aside, A Riveting Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film, about 10 years ago, I thought it was really fascinating. One year later, I still enjoyed but was a bit perplexed: was this the usual Liberal Hollywood taking shots at right-wingers or is this actually the reverse with the left-wingers, the Communists really being shown as the "bad guys?" After a third and final viewing a few years later, I felt it was both but the leaned toward Liberal, which is par for the course. The general plot had left wingers brainwashing an influential American family into looking like extreme right wingers and gaining access to the White House through political influence and assassination. Most of the movie featured a Joe McCarthy-ish senator (James Gregory) and his conniving wife (Angela Lansbury) as the villains. They were portrayed as right wingers, of course, but were really just dupes of the Communists (left wing)! Got that??!Suffice to say the movie had messages from both the Right and Left but politics aside, the film boasts an involving story that keeps your interest for most of the two hours and six minutes, and had some very interesting characters who are fascinating to watch. That includes the supporting roles. It didn't hurt to have John Frankenheimer direct, either. His films usually were outstanding.I thought Lansbury and Laurence Harvey had the best parts of the film. The only really stupid and/or annoying character in the movie was played by Janet Leigh. Her romance scenes with Frank Sinatra added nothing to this riveting film. Eliminated, it would have made for a tighter, even better movie. Also, Sinatra found out too easily where Harvey was hiding in Madison Square Garden. Nobody could figure it out that fast! Nonetheless, the ending was a bit surprising and I won't spoil it for anyone who has not seen this.The movie has endured the test of time and, from what I hear, would have been best left on its own instead of watering down the name of this film with an insipid re-make. This is "The Manchurian Candidate" version you want to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is a reverence surrounding this film that is difficult for the casual viewer to comprehend. It might have been revolutionary for its time, but IMDb users who describe it as timeless seem to have undergone a brainwashing scheme themselves.The plot holes are large and plentiful and some of the acting is diabolical. The story, of a soldier transformed by hypnosis into a murderous automaton, is interesting enough in a B-movie kind of way, but the sheer volume of narrative leaps would test the patience of any modern viewer.Several key scenes are literally incredible. Frank Sinatra meets Janet Leigh on a train and five minutes later, without any warmth on Frank's side, she decides that she is going to leave her fianc for him.Leslie Parrish, playing the leading character's lover, chooses to wear a fancy dress costume that, by sheer coincidence, is the hypnotic trigger to send him into a trance. The likelihood of her wearing a Queen of Diamonds costume is so low that I assumed she must be in on the hypnotist's conspiracy, but it was just a bizarre red herring.Other irritations include the buffoonery of John Yerkes Iselin, the main character's stepfather, who wins the nomination for the vice presidency despite being a hopeless drunk. What was presumably intended as satire merely undermines the plot.And in the final scene, the security at the auditorium where the climactic assassination is due to take place is so lax that any old hit-man could have done it. The evil communists' scheme to groom someone who could get near the presidential candidate was unnecessary, if not counterproductive. If a presidential candidate were to be killed, would the public really support the vice-presidential co-runner if they knew his stepson was the assassin?As for the innovative fight scene, it is terribly unconvincing by today's standards and can't have been that good even in 1962. Henry Silva, Sinatra's kung fu adversary, is downright awful, but even his acting looks Oscar-worthy compared to James Edwards's wooden turn as a spooked GI.The good news, however, is that Jonathan Demme's remake is excellent. The 1962 version is an interesting historical document, but it doesn't work as a thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Manchurian candidate is a true classic thriller where a fictionalized version of communists kidnap a platoon of solders and brainwash them into committing assassinations.What makes this truly shocking from any political war film you ever seen is that it doesn't have invading armies ready to move in, but the shadow group using panic on a nation level to impose martial law.However Raymond Shaw's mother has turned against them and will use the opportunity to create Anarchy. Mrs. Shaw was a brilliantly manipulative complex character using her sex appeal and cunning brain to move events characters around like a game of chess.The haunting music sets the scenes adding to the ominous feeling that a wave is about to strike. There were Oscar worthy performances from Frank Sinatra, Janet Lee and John mcgiver that made this into a master piece that needs to be cherished for all time.However after the assassination of JFK many viewers have tried to compare the film as being an omen of the future and was banned from television for many years because of this. Like Oliver Stone's JFK I don't see it and will leave the speculation for the conspiracy theorists.The Manchurian candidate will change your views about politics forever and makes you want to take a closer look on policies coming from the government ever since 9/11. Who you boys for really matters and to know the candidate which was mocked during the film as senator Shaw spoke gibberish to an applauding audience.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic American cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the auteurs of the French New Wave, US film director John Frankenheimer also approached filmmaking with a fresh playfulness during the early 1960's. Indeed, his 1962 film, The Manchurian Candidate, endures as one of the more unique and interesting American films of its period.The film follows a group of soldiers who've recently been released from the Korean War effort. While Major Marco (Frank Sinatra) suffers from strange reoccurring dreams, his friend Robert Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is even more disturbed as he embarks on a sort of unconscious political killing spree. When Marco learns that Shaw is at the center of a right wing-communist brainwashing conspiracy culminating with the assassination of the presidential incumbent, Marco ultimately realizes he must stop his fellow former soldier before it's too late. The film is also complimented by performances by Janet Leigh, James Gregory and Angela Lansbury.With its use of everything from montage to Cinema Verite-style filming, Candidate was one of the most stylistically bold American films this side of Citizen Kane. Additionally, the film serves as a worthy time capsule of the cold war paranoia that existed during the Kennedy administration (also proving eerily prescient with Kennedy's later assassination in November 1963). With a recent Criterion re-release and the craziness of today's political situation in the US, now's as apt a time as ever to revisit this seminal classic of American cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Cold War political thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning, this review contains spoilers, and if you've never seen the film before, you should definitely watch it without knowing anything first, for maximum enjoyment. :) With that out of the way ? fantastic performances by both Angela Lansbury and Frank Sinatra, great direction by John Frankenheimer, and an excellent plot all make this a film that is still highly enjoyable today. In a nutshell, American soldiers in the Korean War are captured and subjected to sophisticated brainwashing by Russian and Chinese communists, and one of them is programmed to carry out assassinations back in America. Frank Sinatra plays one of the soldiers who has recurring nightmares about the brainwashing, and the sequence where Frankenheimer shows them thinking they're at a meeting at a lady's club talking about flowers, which seems very odd at first, and spins the camera around to gradually show us the horrifying reality of their predicament, and just how controlled they are, is absolutely fantastic. We come to understand the assassin's trigger, the queen of diamonds when told to play solitaire, which is a wonderfully chilling concept, and I loved how the story included a false trigger at a costume party. Angela Lansbury's character evolves over the film, from over-bearing mother and wife, the brains behind her Senator husband's McCarthyism, to the mastermind behind the whole conspiracy - and how this is revealed is as great as her performance. The movie keeps us guessing, perhaps as those swept up in fear of communism guessed at what may be happening around them in their paranoia, and an example of this is Janet Leigh's offbeat dialog with Sinatra when she first meets him on a train. It immediately seems to us as code and a way of controlling him in some way, but it's also flirtatious, and we're left wondering what her role will be.Brilliant as it is, from my perspective, the movie has one major flaw. Frankenheimer was happy to show the dangers of McCarthyism and even commented on this in interviews, and yet there WAS a communist plot to overthrow the government, and there WAS unsuspected (and very dangerous) communist infiltration. So at the end of the day, what was the message ? that McCarthy was right? I don't think it's right to explain this away as satire of both the right and the left, because I don't see the movie as satire, I see it as a political thriller ? but it is a very good one at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Politics and Thrills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Richard Condon's 1959 book of the same name, John Frankenheimer's adaptation of The Manchurian Candidate is considered to be one of America's greatest political thrillers. Now, normally, politics, and being thrilled are two very different concepts, but Condon's book, written a few short years after Senator Joseph McCarthy's accusations of Communist infiltration of the Federal Government helped fan anti-Communist suspicions and paranoia in the US, hit a nerve. To make the story thrilling, Condon and film director Frankenheimer created a narrative that was part murder mystery, part science fiction, and all political allegory. TMC is something of a historical fiction, and a bizarre and surreal mystery. You'll find yourself wondering "what the heck is going on," but you won't be able to give up on it. You'll want to know why Marco keeps having his dreams of the Ladies' Garden Club, why Raymond hates Johnny so much, and what the deal is with "passing the time playing a little solitaire."When the movie was released in 1962, eagerly awaited by the readers of Condon's novel, including President John F. Kennedy, viewers were stunned by what was then considered brutal violence, and they were shocked by that kiss, the nauseating implications of that kiss. The Manchurian Candidate has its flaws, but they are nitpicky at best. The black psychiatrist seems out of place for the mid-1950s and the lax security at the convention come to mind, but the audience may only pick up on those upon repeated viewings. The best part of TMC is its implied message of not letting vigilance morph into paranoia. News flash: Joe McCarthy was an evil man, but even an evil man can be right once in awhile. McCarthy's tactics were so anti-American that the actual need for vigilance against Communist infiltration of government, education, and popular culture was badly damaged. Without realizing it, McCarthy's repulsive antics actually helped the Communist effort to destabilize the United States. Ol' Joe was right--there were Communists burrowing into the fabric of American governance--but using "McCarthyism" to reveal the infiltration was counter- productive.By now, the average viewer of a "political thriller" might be looking for the remote to find an old NCIS on the tube, but Frankenheimer keeps ratcheting up the pressure on the audience. He keeps putting clues, like doggie treats, in our food bowl. And we can't turn away. The performances are almost flawless. Frank Sinatra is a totally sympathetic Bennett Marco, Lawrence Harvey is superb as the emotionally whipsawed Raymond Shaw, Angela Lansbury oozes a distilled and aged evil, and Khigh Dhiegh--who would go on to be the evil Chinese agent, "Wo Fat" in Hawaii Five-0-- is a delightfully dangerous Dr. Yen Lo, who cooks up the plan to turn Raymond into the perfect killer, the one who "isn't burdened by guilt or fear."The only fly in the ointment is Janet Leigh, whose character's intentions are a mystery, but who, as an actress, doesn't seem believable, or for that matter, terribly interesting. Leigh's "Rosie" is an important part of the story, but she almost phone's in her performance.And if that's all I have for complaints, then I should thank my lucky stars, shut up, and . . . Play a little solitaire.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate (1962): Dir: John Frankenheimer / Cast: Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, Janet Leigh, James Gregory: Spellbinding thriller about control as Laurence Harvey returns home as a war hero unaware of the brainwash tactic applied to him by the Soviets. Frank Sinatra plays a war buddy who has nightmares about a particular incident where lives were taken yet all traces of knowledge and guilt are erased. Sinatra becomes involved in an investigation that could lead to assassination and the reality of what the nightmares were really about. Director John Frankenheimer places elements just outside of view while analyzing the brainwashing factor and its effect on the victims. Sinatra brings anguish and determination as he slowly pieces everything together. Harvey plays a man oblivious to his sudden nature. Angela Lansbury plays Harvey's mother whose wickedness knows no limits. If there is a weakness then it can only be the role played by Janet Leigh, which seems misplaced as a woman Sinatra meets and romances on a train. The role comes off as a prop and only serves Leigh as a superb successful followup to her superior work in Psycho. James Gregory plays a Senator who will be discovered as a communist. Theme demonstrates how we may be controlled without recognition of such acts. Score: 9 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting cold war thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Korean War a squad of American soldiers are captured by communist forces but strangely after the war none of them have any memory of this; they all believe that they fought their way through enemy lines thanks to the skill and bravery of Sergeant Raymond Shaw. Shaw is awarded the Congressional Medal of Honour for his actions but one man has concerns about him. His former CO, Major Bennett Marco, suffers from recurring nightmares where he sees to troops undergoing a brain washing procedure and Shaw killing one of his comrades. Marco believes that it is more than a dream and wants to investigate. It won't be easy though; Shaw is regarded as a hero and his step-father is a senator on an anti-communist crusade. Even Shaw doesn't realise what has happened to him but given the right trigger? the sight of the queen of diamonds he will follow the instructions he is given? whether that is to kill his boss or jump in a lake! Will Marco be able to prove his theories and stop Shaw and those controlling him before their ultimate plan can be carried out. Away from the central plot there is some romance; with both Marco and Shaw getting involved with attractive blondes.This is a solid thriller with plenty of tension, some shocking moments and a touch of tragedy. The idea of a hero who is actually an enemy agent (even if he doesn't realise it in this case) will be familiar to anybody who watched 'Homeland' but this was made half a century earlier. It nicely captures the cold war paranoia about communists? sometimes playing on it by showing the senator who gives a different 'exact number' of communists in the Defence Department; something that makes him look a bit of a buffoon but does serve to keep people asking 'How many communists have infiltrated?'. The cast does a solid job with fine performances from Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey, as Marco and Shaw, although I'm surprised no explanation was added to explain Shaw's English accent? perhaps it was just how it was done then; much like having western actors playing East Asian characters; something I can't image a modern film doing. Of the secondary characters it is Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin, Shaw's mother, which stands out most thanks to Angela Lansbury's brilliant performance as this unlikable character. The central story is gripping and leads to a great ending but the romantic subplot involving Marco seems a bit tacked on; it is particularly superfluous as Shaw's romance is more interesting and becomes important to the main plot. While there isn't a huge amount of action there are some genuine shocks; I certainly didn't expect a blood splash on the wall after Shaw shoots somebody in the head given that most films of the era didn't show such things. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a good paranoid thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manchurian Candidate is A Pin-Sharp Nightmare!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer's jazzy, hip screen adaptation of Richard Condon's bestselling novel, The Manchurian Candidate is one of the strangest and most mercurial movies ever made in Hollywood ? a rare film that truly is so ahead of its times. A veritable concoction of various genres and emotional textures, this exciting black-and-white cold war thriller never flags for an instant. The sordid tale gets off to an early start: a small American patrol is captured during the Korean War by Communists, bent on dominating the uppermost echelons of American politics. Whisked off to Communist China, the platoon becomes subject to brainwashing techniques that wipe their conscious memory and plant a cover story for Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), the man chosen to be a sleeper assassin. Shortly thereafter, he is seen being welcomed home in Washington as a Congressional Medal of Honor winner for his gallantry. The platoon members are soon haunted by dreams that reveal the truth of what occurred: though decorated as such, Shaw isn't the hero who saved their lives; rather, he's just another victim of a terrible, traumatic violation. The platoon's commander, Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) senses something amiss and, determines to unravel the seemingly vicious conspiracy. Meanwhile, Shaw plays his part, manipulated by Soviet agents and his coldly calculating mother (Angela Lansbury ? motivated by her husband's political agenda) as the plot he's been programmed to carry out draws closer to fruition. The captain's subsequent pursuit of the truth comprises the unusual plot which takes us from the halls of Congress to a stunning climax at a Madison Square Garden political convention. Angela Lansbury, as the scheming, caustic mother is sinfully captivating while Laurence Harvey is pitch-perfect as the docile, disturbed son/war-hero. Sinatra along with the rest of the secondary cast is never less than effective. Frankenheimer's direction is nothing short of masterful, achieving maximum subversion of the audience with a blend of unsettling compositions and fly-on-the-wall photography. The quick cuts and tricky juxtaposition of scenes match the flamboyance of the script. Especially brilliant are the dream sequences that toggle between objective and subjective points of view on the brainwashing demonstration. The political paranoia may, at first glance, seem far-fetched, but when you figure that reality is just as bizarre, you realize the story's sobering clairvoyance.The fascinating thing is that, from uncertain premise to shattering conclusion, one does not question plausibility: the events being rooted in their own cinematic reality. Chilling in the extreme, The Manchurian Candidate is a sensational paranoid thriller: a lurid tale of high-level subterfuge, depicting, in unflinching detail, the beginning of the end for post-war American optimism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a mystery movie in which we watch a man who is an intelligence officer in the U.S. Army and he served valiantly as a captain in the Korean war. Although this man has a problem he sees a recurring nightmare in which one where two members of his squad are killed by someone else. After some time he learns that also some others in his Korean War unit have nightmares similar to his own and then he realizes that something happened to all of them in Korea.I liked this movie because it shows us many truths about Korean War and what happened to many of people who have been there. Also it shows how difficult was for them not only in the war bit also afterward in their simple life in which they had also some other issues. The direction of this movie which made by John Frankenheimer was simply outstanding. I also have to admit that the interpretation of Frank Sinatra who played as Major Bennett Marco was very good and equally good was also the interpretation of Laurence Harvey who played as Raymond Shaw.Finally I have to say that "The Manchurian Candidate" is a great movie to watch because it represents the truth behind a war in general and make us understand many things about it. I believe that this is the most important part of this movie and this is why this movie is so unique.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A U.S army patrol led by Raymond Shaw and Major Ben Marco is captured by Soviet troops during the Korean War. At the end of the war, the men return to the States with no knowledge of what happened. The jaded Shaw is awarded the Medal of Honour for bravery in combat and hailed as a hero whilst Marco begins working for military intelligence. The latter is plagued by sinister nightmares and he begins an extensive investigation, re-uniting with Shaw in the process. A horrific truth is soon uncovered that will change the lives of both men forever...Apart from the above synopsis, you should know NOTHING about The Manchurian Candidate before watching it for the first time. It will strike it's most bruising blow if you are ignorant to the details of the plot. Based on a novel of the same name, George Axelrod's script is intelligently constructed and the premise just as brilliantly conceived. The script will pull you into the clever depths of the story and have you hooked for the entire duration of the film, allowing you to engage with the plot. However, the otherwise magnificent script is wrought with quite a few plot holes, some of which are big enough to drive a bus through. Unfortunately, the film suffers slightly because of this. Still, the script contains a substantial amount of memorable dialogue and the plot never becomes convoluted. The Manchurian Candidate s definitely a product of it's time. It exploits the number one threat to the free world which was prevalent throughout the latter half of the 20th century. As a tried and true realist, I strongly doubt that the event depicted in the film could have taken place, even in the 1950s and 60s. Although, it's an extremely curious thought at the same time. The film is a Thriller verging on political satire which feeds on the crazed paranoia of American and British audiences of the time and despite being far fetched, is terrifyingly real!. The film boasts one of the most impressive casts I've ever seen. Laurence Harvey plays the tormented soul that is Raymond Shaw exceptionally well. At the beginning, I was unsure about the idea of a British actor playing an American character, but as the film progressed the role could never have been filled by another actor. With his tawny appearance and piercing demeanour, Harvey was able to embody the character with overpowering intensity. Frank Sinatra provides sturdy support as Major Ben Marco in what I consider to be a milestone in Sinatra's acting career. Janet Leigh also gave a first rate performance, as did Douglas Henderson as Colonel Milt, Major Marco's superior officer. James Gregory and John McGiver turned in staunch portrays of the two rival senators. However, the best performance in the film without a doubt comes from Angela "Murder She Wrote" Lansbury. Her portrayal of Mrs Iselin is the greatest performance from a female actor that I've ever seen in film or TV. Her restrained portray crackles with intensity, making her character deliciously frightening.Both the cinematography and editing are inspired. In terms of the cinematography, the occasional use of diagonal shots make certain scenes feel dreamlike and were extremely effective. The several large close-ups also worked excellently, making me feel as if the characters were addressing me personally. The inclusion of various point of view shots as well as both subjective and objective camera angles were incredibly stylish. The nightmare sequences were truly commendable indeed.Here, Ferris Webster(the editor)turns the process of editing into an art. They were shot and edited in such a sophisticated manor that I found myself looking twice in order to interpret fully what was going on in these scenes. The masterful cinematography and brisk editing are at their peak during the gripping climax. John Frankenheimer cranks the suspense up to dizzying highs in what I consider to be one of the most taut sequences ever filmed. I will say nothing more, but the climax and ending of The Manchurian Candidate are what puts the capital T in Thriller.The Manchurian Candidate is a significant and though provoking slice of classic(or maybe even modern)cinema. Providing a momentous "what if?" scenario as well as a riveting insight into the obsessive politics of a bygone era, it deserves to be seen by all. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"You couldn't stop them. The army couldn't stop them...so I had to."Just finished this absolutely fantastic thriller from John Frankenheimer. It's gripping throughout, the black and white photography is great, the Hitchcockian angles and camera tricks work perfectly, and the whole thing has this surreal/hyper-real feel to it. I can't really describe the story in any detail without spoilers, but basically it's about a communist conspiracy in American politics in the early 60s, the man brainwashed to become an assassin, and the man trying to uncover the conspiracy (Frank Sinatra) and help the brainwashed man. The cast are all excellent, especially Laurence Harvey, who gives a comically awkward, confused performance that's a perfect counterpoint to the no-nonsense assuredness of Sinatra's intelligence officer Major Bennett Marco. One of my favourite scenes has a drunken Harvey sit down and reminisce about how he used be lovable when he was in love with the daughter of his father's opposition, how she was lovable, how everyone was lovable and how he's not lovable any more, Sinatra all the while sitting it out until Harvey passes out. These strangely comical scenes are what makes the film special, making the whole thing seem unreal and dreamlike. There is also a series of dream sequences that feature a woman talking about the best way to grow Hydrangeas, yak dung cigarettes and bloody murder. James Gregory is good as the drunk, idiotic senator running for president (Bush much?), and Angela Lansbury is excellent as the overbearing mother. Janet Leigh doesn't have much to do but is excellent in a scene on a train with Sinatra.Highly enjoyable thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant Conspiracy Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Sinatra plays Major Ben Marco, who has chronic nightmares about Sergeant Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) killing members of their unit after they were POWs during the Korean War. Turns out, they were both brainwashed by scientists from Manchuria in an experiment that directly involves Raymond, and then his (publicly) anti-communist mother(unforgettably played by Angela Lansbury) who is pushing her indecisive Senator husband Iselin, played by James Gregory, to make a name for himself by publicly naming 57 communists in the government. All are involved in an assassination plot that will shatter their lives, and affect the country forever...Brilliant conspiracy theory film is supremely well directed by John Frankenheimer, as are the performances of the whole cast, with an inspired &amp; daring plot with many twists and turns, and is also deeply subversive for both sides(left &amp; right) that still makes it relevant today, and remains profoundly cynical about politicians and politics, making it a truly classic, prescient thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had expected 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be a political thriller but it turned out to be much more than. The element of psychology is very crucial here and the plot is quite clever despite being far-fetched at times (an example being the Communists leaving their plan of world domination in the hands of an uncontrolled soldier). The key idea, derived from of Pavlov's experiments is quite inventive and the way the story unfolds, leaves the viewer in suspense. 'The MC' also touches on various other themes such as incest, which are cleverly weaved into the story.The tension is exceptionally well built. The nightmare sequences, the scenes between Raymond and his mother and between Raymond and Marco are among the highlights. The cinematography is also noteworthy especially in the interaction sequences.The cast is very good. Frank Sinatra is brilliant but this is more Laurence Harvey's film and he does a smoothe job of playing a complex figure who is arrogant and self-centered, loving and guilt ridden and a cold blooded killer. Janet Leigh has a brief part which is done quite adequately and with some class but, in my opinion, it's Angela Lansbury who transcends as the power-hungry, conniving, manipulative and obsessive mother. I had never seen her in a negative role. simply put, she's mindblowing.'The Manchurian Candidate' is dark, clever, chilling and, to an extent, even ahead of its time. It's one of the finest thrillers that have stood the test of time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, loved the plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate's pace is very tasteful and gentle; it keeps you on the edge and then spins you out of sync when some unforeseen and probably unexplainable scenes pop up, but then the events pull you back in, in a most masterful and surreal way as you wait to see all the events matchup. The Manchurian Candidate is a mix of suspense, thriller and the dialogues are very intense and to some, it could be seen to possess some dark humor.The unveiling of the mastermind behind the whole plot in the movie, or better still the mastermind behind the control of Raymond Shaw makes you the viewer raise an eye lid of the depth many will go for power. The movies conspiracy theory and mix of some kind of Sci-Fi in the whole brainwashing and mind control aspect of the film, makes The Manchurian Candidate more appealing to a variety of audience.The plot is about a squad in the Korean War, where the Major, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and his Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), returned home to be well received and Shaw even got a medal of honor for his exploits of saving his squad during the war.As Shaw grew to be in the public eye driven by his ever bearing mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury), Marco starts having recurring nightmares, where he sees Shaw kill two of his squad members and the nightmare led him to believe that the whole story he knows to have happened in Korea may not be real.John Frankenheimer the director and also the producer did a fine job on the screenplay based on a Richard Condon's 1959 novel of the same name, both film and novel are about the cold war and the acting by star actor and musician Frank Sinatra is one that needs to be seen. Angela Lansbury (Disney's Bedknobs and Broomsticks in 1971) who plays the role of the mother of Raymond Shaw got an Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress, for her wonderful portrayal of Mrs Iselin.The Manchurian Candidate was both a critical and financial success one that many should see, including you. Every moment you spend watching this film you will love and remember. The suspense keeps you glued.A remake of this 1962 classic was done by Jonathan Demme (Oscar winner of Best Director for the 1991 film The Silence of the Lambs and the critical acclaimed Philadelphia in 1993 also starring Denzel Washington) in 2004, and it starred Denzel Washington, Meryl Streep and Liev Schreiber, it was a critical success but not much of a box office success like it's 1962 predecessor.www.lagsreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best ever for Frank Sinatra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, as far as thrillers of its era go, is more complexly handled than a Hitchcock movie and far more respecting of the actors. Therefore, ultimately, more satisfying. This, for me, has to be the best performance on screen from Frank Sinatra. I could not spot one one false move in all his lengthy screen time, compared with say, a scene or two from Brando where at some point he is almost bound to be just a little too theatrical. Most stars these days seem content to walk through their roles, unless they're throwing themselves off buildings, through fires, amid a blaze of special effects. Just note the scene where Major Marco is having a drink in the smokers' car on the train and trying to light his cigarette, apparently unaware of Janet Leigh, and the scene where Leigh pursues him outside to light his cigarette... Brilliant. Even more amazing when you consider Sinatra normally insisted on just one take.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paranoia and Suspicion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The central idea behind "The Manchurian Candidate" is that a former American serviceman has been brainwashed to assassinate a leading political figure. At first sight this plot might appear to have been inspired by the killing of President Kennedy, but in fact the film came out in 1962, a year before the assassination.The assassin is Staff Sergeant Raymond Shaw, the stepson of a leading Senator and the winner of the Medal of Honor. Shaw won the medal during the Korean War, where he saved the lives of several members of his platoon in combat. Or so it is believed. In fact, the entire platoon was captured by Communist forces, taken to a secret Chinese base in Manchuria where they were brainwashed and false memories implant in their minds. The soldiers were then secretly returned to the American lines, unaware of their ordeal and believing Shaw was responsible for saving them.The film was made at the height of the Cold War- it was released at the time of the Cuban missile crisis- and its politics are firmly anti-Communist. Its political message, however, is put over by means of a clever twist. In the early scenes, it seems more like an "anti-anti-Communist" satire. It initially seems obvious that Shaw's stepfather, Senator John Iselin, is intended as a satirical portrait of Joseph McCarthy. Iselin appears to be a ranting buffoon, obsessed with a supposed Communist conspiracy to infiltrate the US Defense Department, although he can never remember exactly how many card-carrying Communists are supposed to work there. (He eventually settles on 57, taking that number from a bottle of Heinz tomato ketchup). Iselin's political opponent, Senator Thomas Jordan, is portrayed as a decent liberal, concerned to defend civil liberties and the Constitution. Interestingly, Iselin and Jordan appear to be members of the same party, although it is never made clear whether they are Republicans or Democrats. Jordan's daughter Jocelyn also plays a role as Shaw's love-interest.The film, however, actually supports the basic McCarthyite assumption that the Communists are conspiring to infiltrate America's political establishment. The twist is that Iselin and his wife Eleanor are actually the leading lights in that conspiracy, of which the assassination plot is a key part, and his anti-Communist rhetoric is simply a front to hide his true affiliations. Even Jordan, who sees Iselin as a neo-fascist demagogue, does not realise the true situation.The real hero of the film is not Jordan but Major Bennett Marco, Shaw's former platoon commander in Korea. Marco was one of the brainwashed soldiers, and it was his recommendation which was responsible for Shaw winning the Medal of Honor. Following a series of nightmares, however, Marco, who now works for Army Intelligence, becomes suspicious of the whole affair, and begins his own investigations to uncover the truth.The film has a couple of flaws. The odd sub-plot involving Janet Leigh's character Eugenie seems not only unnecessary but also practically incomprehensible. Perhaps the producers felt they needed a big-name female star. (In 1962 Angela Lansbury was largely though of as a character actress). The character of Dr. Yen Lo, the Chinese head of the brainwashing programme, is uncomfortably close to the racist "Fu Manchu" stereotype of the fiendish Oriental villain.Those, however, would be my only criticisms. Overall, this was a film I greatly enjoyed. It features three excellent performances- from Frank Sinatra as the dogged Marco, Lansbury as the monstrous, domineering, power-crazed Eleanor who aims to dominate her son, her husband and ultimately the whole country, and Laurence Harvey as Shaw. As in many of her films, Lansbury plays a character considerably older than her real age. (She was only 37 in 1962, only three years older than Harvey who plays her son). Before I saw this film I normally thought of her as a niche actress specialising in elderly female detectives like Jessica Fletcher in the "Murder She Wrote" series or Miss Marple in "The Mirror Crack'd", but here she takes on a dramatic role of great power. (She was nominated for an Academy Award as Best Supporting Actress).Harvey was an actor who never really achieved the international stardom that was at one time predicted for him, but he did make at least two excellent films, this one and "Room at the Top" from four years earlier. His Shaw is a cold, unsociable character, uneasy with the public adulation he receives after his supposed act of heroism, and even more uneasy with his position as a member of one of America's leading political families. (He detests both his mother and his stepfather). Although Shaw is not in himself evil, it is all too easy to see Harvey's character as a mindless, brainwashed killer.Apart from the acting, what makes "The Manchurian Candidate" so watchable is its strange, creepy atmosphere of paranoia and suspicion. Although the film is anti-Communist, that does not necessarily mean that it is right-wing. (Its director John Frankenheimer had a reputation as something of a liberal). Its hero is the little man, working outside the system. (Marco's suspicions initially receive no support from his superiors at Army Intelligence). The message, perhaps, is not to trust anyone political, be they Communists or Washington insiders. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Is What Is Known as a Forced Deck</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We begin in 1952 Korea, with an important establishing scene (keep it in mind as you watch the story unfold). After the credits, stoic Laurence Harvey (as Raymond Shaw) returns from the Korean War a decorated hero; his arrival is immediately copped for political advantage by manipulative mother Angela Lansbury (as Eleanor) and bombastic step-father James Gregory (as John "Johnny" Iselin). A powerful behind-the-scenes woman, Ms. Lansbury has Presidential aspirations for her Senator husband, a red-baiting Republican in the Joe McCarthy mold. Also returning from Korean War service is chain-smoking Frank Sinatra (as Bennett "Ben" Marco), who served with Mr. Harvey. Troubled by a nightmarish dream, Mr. Sinatra goes to the US military with his concerns...Apparently, the entire American platoon was brainwashed by Chinese communists! That is not exactly what happened, of course. "The Manchurian Candidate" (this film version, anyway) is open to several interpretations, and unveils just enough of the Richard Condon story to keep you watching. This adaptation, to quote Lansbury's character, is "perfectly marvelous." John Frankenheimer and George Axelrod juxtapose a unique combination of surreal scenes and bizarre dialogue, resulting is one of those rare films that takes on a life of its own. Even the puzzlingly short appearance by Janet Leigh makes sense, in context. While critically applauded, only "Film Daily" gave the film a "Best Picture" honor, but Lansbury's mean mother won her several "Supporting Actress" awards; she bites into the meatiest role of her career with relish.Sinatra and Harvey (his character obviously educated in England) are also excellent.Relax, the Cold War was only a bad dream.********** The Manchurian Candidate (10/24/62) John Frankenheimer ~ Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, Janet Leigh</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconditionally brilliant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most insightful, penetrating, prescient, prophetic movies ever made. It is simultaneously thrilling, tense, humorous, emotional and tragic. The plotting, direction, performances are beyond criticism, but there's a great deal more to it. Where to start? Listening to the BBC this morning, it is clear that McCarthy was right about the infiltration of Communist agents into American government and life in general. In fact, there were more hidden Communist agents in the USA after WWII than in any other country in the world. Next in line was France. Was Richard Condon aware of this? He published his book, on which the film is based, in 1959. His works are known for his "loathing of those in power", and often "have elements of classical tragedy". The story told is very similar in many ways to the tragedy of Hamlet, and throughout it there is a pervasive sense that "something is rotten" in the state. In both Hamlet and the Manchurian Candidate there are strong psychological undertones: both can be interpreted in Freudian terms.Another book, published in 1963, helps towards an understanding of the background to the political situation. This is "The Techniques of Persuasion", by J.A.C.Brown. It reveals that the brainwashing techniques developed by the Chinese (or Russians) in Korea were more successful in converting American prisoners of war than prisoners of other nations. The reasons for this are complicated. American POWs returning from Korea generally received an extremely raw deal from their country.The film has in the past been severely censured by both right-wing and left-wing intellectuals alike. These diametrically opposed criticisms indicate the film's exceptional subtlety. The role played by Janet Leigh in the film has sometimes been obtusely dismissed as irrelevant. This film was not made by idiots, however, and anyone genuinely interested in the plot will do well to ruminate deeply on why she is there, and what part she may be playing. The film doesn't tell us, but there are strong hints that she is a kind of minder, planted by US intelligence.Senator McCarthy/Iselin/Claudius was on to something, almost unwittingly. He was not a clever politician, however, nor very bright, and was perhaps being used by both sides in the real cold war. The film is undoubtedly somewhat misogynist, or at least mother-hating, like many post-war films of the noir variety. Shaw is constrained to kill both his mother/Gertrude, and his stepfather; as well as Jocelyn/Ophelia along with Jordan/Polonius.The Manchurian Candidate is one of the most intelligent, bravest, most wonderful American films I've yet come across. Goodnight, sweet prince, concludes Sinatra. I'm not going to bother with the remake in these dumbed-down days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Korean War 'hero' (Laurence Harvey) comes back to the United States a brainwashed zombie triggered to kill a liberal politician, his control being his own monstrously ambitious mother (Angela Lansbury).The Manchurian Candidate is an insanely plotted but brilliantly handled political paranoia thriller, a mixture of Alfred Hitchcock, Orson Welles and All The King's Men. Brilliant and harrowing; very much a product of its time, with its brainwashing theme, it holds up well for successive generations. The film was nationally released on Wednesday, October 24, 1962, at the height of the Cuban Missile Crisis. In 1994, it was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being "culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why haven't I already written a comment on this movie? I love it so much I have not been able to watch the Denzel Washington/Meryl Streep remake. Just as many believe that sacred texts should not be translated, certain landmarks of world cinema should not be touched (imagine a remake of "Citizen Kane," "Gone With the Wind," or "2001: A Space Odyssey"). "The Manchurian Candidate" is an example of what the late psychoanalyst Carl Gustav Jung called synchronicity, a rare meeting of the minds when everything came together: producer/star Frank Sinatra, screenwriter George Axelrod and director John Frankenheimer were in complete harmony. It was a courageous film to make in 1962, the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis, when America (and the world) teetered on the brink of destruction. The film has a "plague on both your houses" attitude toward the Cold War, mercilessly skewering the lunatic fringe conservatives while portraying the Chinese and Russian communists as diabolical, almost Mephistophelian schemers. At the time of the Korean War the Soviet/Chinese split had yet to occur, so it made sense for a Chinese psychologist (Khieh Digh) to work with the Russians. The film is almost science fiction in its exploration of brainwashing techniques that are hopefully still years beyond us in application, reminding me of Isaac Asimov's Mule and Second Foundation. Angela Lansbury is perhaps the most evil mother in screen history as the Red Queen, a superpatriotic grande dame secretly in cahoots with the Commies. The incest between her and her son, Raymond Shaw (the brilliant Lawrence Harvey) is barely hinted at but disturbing nonetheless. Frank Sinatra gives the finest performance of his acting career as Bennett DeMarco; there's not a false note in his portrayal of a man undergoing post-traumatic stress disorder. Janet Leigh shines as the stranger on the train who becomes his shelter from the storm; I cannot believe those commentators who suggest she was a communist agent. This film was so powerful that Sinatra withdrew it from circulation after the Kennedy assassination, fearing it might have influenced Lee Harvey Oswald (along with another Sinatra thriller, 1954's "Suddenly"). My only criticism is that I would like to know more of the back story: how did Mrs. Iselin make contact with the Soviets? What exactly were the experiments performed by Yen Lo? That aside, this is an immortal classic that I will always treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant Depiction Of Cold War Paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you didn't grow up during the height of the Cold War in the 50's and 60's, or if you've never taken the time to study it, then this movie might be a little bit hard to relate to. It's literally immersed in the atmosphere and paranoia of the Cold War, and the best way to relate to this movie if you don't have that background might be to reflect upon the fact that some of the paranoid reactions to Muslims in the current so-called "War on Terror" is not unlike the reaction to suspected Communists in the era this movie was made in.The performances in this are all top-notch. Totally out of character (at least as I've ever known her) was Angela Lansbury as the completely evil mother of Raymond (Laurence Harvey) and wife of the bumbling and incompetent Senator Iselin (James Gregory.) In a field of great performances, Lansbury really does steal the show, particularly because this is so unlike the type of character you expect to find her playing. I don't want to downplay the other actors, though. From Harvey and Gregory to Frank Sinatra this cast was superb. I had a bit of trouble figuring out Janet Leigh's character of Rosie, who ends up marrying Sinatra's Major Marco. She appears all of a sudden; they get married all of a sudden. At first, I thought she was part of the conspiracy - but I guess I was just getting caught up in the paranoia.The story is wonderfully bizarre - and difficult to follow if you miss too much of it. We know from the start that it's about an American patrol captured during the Korean War and brainwashed, but you're never sure where it's going in the end. It's not the type of movie where you can fall asleep for fifteen minutes and pick right back up. (Not that you'd be tempted to.) It has twists and turns, and you can never really be sure who the good guys and bad guys are. It all leads up to an absolutely stunning and shocking ending. It's great entertainment and - if you can make that connection between the Cold War and the War on Terror, it still has a message. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fifty-two queens of diamonds tell you to watch this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate, released in the year of the Cuban Missile Crisis is frequently offered up as a symbol of Cold War paranoia: the war has come home, and even an all-American war hero could be a secret assassin. But at the same time it's a surreal satire on that paranoia, from the memorable juxtaposition of a genteel garden party and a Communist war council to the absurd terms of the hypnosis to the bumbling ineptness of the film's McCarthy stand-in. At the same time it's a Freudian drama revolving around a repressed, frigid son and a controlling mother. In weaving together the political and the psychoanalytical inside the generic conventions of the spy genre The Manchurian Candidate turns out to be a better Hitchcock movie than anything Hitch ever directed.The film never lags, but it takes its time establishing its characters and their motivations, as well as the web of political tension underlying everything. It's willing to spend twenty minutes moving plot pieces around, and those twenty minutes will go by like five. The performances of Laurence Harvey and Angela Landsbury as Raymond Shaw and his mother anchor the film and make it both human and profoundly cold. (Hollywood-mandated leads Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh don't embarrass themselves, although the latter's presence is a bit of an enigma.) I was entertained bell to bell, which usually doesn't happen with a two- hour movie from fifty years ago, so at least in that regards it's withstood the test of time, despite the very timely nature of its thematic concerns.Beyond a couple of clunky plot contrivances and the usual Freudian misogyny, The Manchurian Candidate is a remarkable film that works as both a genre piece and as a social commentary. Like Dr. Strangelove (with which it would make an excellent double bill), it both emblematizes the height of Cold War paranoia and skewers it. Classic film buffs will already be well acquainted with it, but even for those who usually steer clear of anything black and white, it's well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The absolute peak of political thrillers.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always considered The Manchurian Candidate to be the film to have set the bar for political thrillers, one of my favorite genres, and as far as I'm concerned that bar has never been met since. The script from George Axelrod, working off the novel by Richard Condon, is a labyrinth of conspiracy and intrigue, making the motivations of each character unclear and putting the truth of every moment constantly in question. You can never be sure if what you are watching is a fact or a deception, thoroughly absorbing you into a dizzied state. Frankenheimer has created a rare film that is able to keep it's atmosphere going through every scene. From the first deeply unsettling dream/memory that we experience, everything becomes immersed in this eerie tone, that haunting world somewhere between fantasy and reality.Condon's characters come alive on the screen, as portrayed by an ensemble of compelling actors at the top of their game. Raymond Shaw is one of the most tragic characters ever put to film, and Laurence Harvey's portrayal of him is an all-time favorite. Harvey creates a deeply sympathetic figure out of a spoiled boy, torn by his desires and his duties, torn apart on all sides by people who want to use him for their own gain. Every moment with him is a rich character study, as Harvey portrays the deep anguish and unrequited desires of this broken man. The Oedipal subtext between him and one of the most terrifying screen mother's, played with sinister skill by Angela Lansbury, adds yet another layer to this remarkably realized performance.The story is rich with political commentary on McCarthyism, but it's social relevance still manages to resonate today. Frankenheimer's direction is some of the best ever put on screen, fully in control of his entire picture, staging everything exactly how it needs to be. Scenes that appear insignificant early on are given great importance, there isn't a moment that is wasted whether we are building characters or setting the stage for the ultimate showdown. Using innovative angles and shooting techniques, Frankenheimer heightens the tension beyond what was already on the page, creating a thriller that makes it's audience think while also keeping them on the edge of their seat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant, Paranoid Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When people make lists of the great films of the Sixties, you usually find such films as LAWRENCE OF ARABIA, TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD, GEORGY GIRL, BONNIE AND CLYDE, and THE GRADUATE. All fine films, to be sure, and all deserving of the accolades bestowed upon them.But one film, curiously, often gets left off that list, and it's a shame, because for my money it leaves every single one of the pictures I mentioned above in the dust. I am referring to John Frankenheimer's brilliant, paranoid Cold War suspense thriller, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE.Describing this film is difficult. Not because of spoilers; the plot is such a labyrinth that I could lay it all out and it would not spoil a thing. It's hard to describe because it has to be experienced.Frank Sinatra, in one of his best performances, stars as Major Bennett Marco, a member of a platoon that was taken prisoner during the Korean conflict and subjected to some really scary brainwashing techniques. At the outset, Marco and some of his former buddies are having terrible nightmares about their experiences, and Marco is eventually affected by it enough that his commanding officer orders him to take sick leave. He decides to visit his former sergeant, an unlikeable man named Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), who is not suffering from nightmares but who reacts strangely when confronted by a deck of cards.One of the films strangest scenes takes place on the train to New York, where Shaw lives. Marco, so upset that his shaking fingers cannot light his cigarette, leaves the club car and stands in the vestibule. He is followed by a woman who was observing him. Her name is Eugenie Rose Chaney, played by Janet Leigh in one of her best performances. I will not reveal the dialogue that passes between them; suffice it to say that it is so strange as to be utterly incomprehensible, but these two end up falling in love.The other two major players in the piece are Raymond's stepfather, Johnny Iselin (James Gregory), a thinly-veiled Joseph McCarthy, and his overbearing wife Eleanor, played by Angela Lansbury. At first, Mrs Iselin simply seems to be an annoyance; she drags her husband around by the nose, irritates her son at every turn, and in general is a pain in the ass. It is not until much later that Lansbury shows her cards, as it were, and we are treated to the portrait of one of the most evil mothers ever put on the screen. Lansbury is brilliant; one of the most versatile performers of her day, she would only a couple of years later go from this dark character to being the toast of Broadway as the life- loving socialite Mame Dennis in the musical MAME. She was nominated for an Oscar for this role, but lost to Patty Duke for THE MIRACLE WORKER. A tough call; I think Duke's performance is equally amazing.I am not sure anyone born after the Berlin Wall came down will quite get the level of paranoid hysteria that drives the core of this film. I don't know what Jonathan Demme did with this story in his unnecessary remake, and I never shall, because I have no desire to see it. But if for nothing else than Lansbury's performance, this one demands to be seen. And like the best of Hitchcock's work, this one rewards multiple viewings. A true American classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Janet Leigh Steals the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an indication of just how audacious the novel and book are, I point the reader/viewer to the scene in the train car between Marco and Rosie. I recall being perplexed (and amused) by their strange and quirky conversation when I first read the novel years ago. Only later did it begin to occur to me (and, of course, to many others) that there is possibly much more to Rosie than we (and Marco) are led to believe at the outset.Ms. Leigh was a major star when the film came out, so why would she be given such a relatively small supporting role? How, really, does she happen to be on that train to begin with? Why, indeed, do Rosie and Marco carry on this bewildering conversation? Are these two merely playing an insipid, "meet-cute" scene to soften the tone of an otherwise-consistently acerbic and caustic film for awhile, a film which never, otherwise, loses its satiric-tragic tone (and how many movies, short of RoboCop, to name one, are able successfully to present a sustained balance of satire and tragedy)? How can Rosie so precipitously jettison her fianc without a second thought and with no apparent pain or regret? Is there, in their conversation, Marco's version of Shaw's trigger question, "Why don't you pass the time by playing a little solitaire?" When Marco proposes marriage, why does Rosie never unequivocally answer his question?Every character in the film is being somehow controlled by someone: Dr. Yen, toeing the Party line he clearly views with contempt as being beneath his virtuosity and cunning; Raymond's mother, who has discovered to her horror (and, probably, delight), in a magnificent perversion of the pieta, that her own, only son had been given over to the Grand Plan and who then, straight from Macbeth, vows both complicity and revenge; Senator Iselin, a (willing?) pawn to Raymond's mother and (unwillingly?) to his alcoholism; Marco, enslaved by two PtSD triggers: combat and brainwashing; but who remains a loyal Army officer saved (or later sacrificed?) by his beloved Rosie; Shaw, an unwilling pawn to brainwashing and (perhaps willingly) to his mother and who suffers from a third PtSD trigger: incest, until he is saved (or would he, too, later have been sacrificed?) by his beloved Jocie (yes, the names rhyme), who, like Rosie, also appears seemingly out of nowhere with a superficially-insipid manner.It may just be that the film ends with the death of all the characters, even if some of them--up to the point the narrative stops--continue to walk and breathe. Were any of them ever, really, alive to begin with, or are we witness to an exquisitely crafted ghost story?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manchurian Candidate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had seen the Denzel Washington/Jonathan Demme remake prior to seeing this original classic that I had seen bits and pieces of, this one of course is much more acclaimed, from Golden Globe nominated director John Framenheimer (Birdman of Alcatraz, Deception). Basically Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) returns from Korea, War with the Congressional Medal of Honour, to his domineering mother Mrs. Iselin (Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Angela Lansbury), who he tries to distance himself from. His commanding officer Maj. Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) has been having nightmares where he is seeing Raymond and other officers are being brainwashed to carrying out orders, and superiors send him on leave telling them this. He goes to visit Raymond, they have a fight, and gets arrested, and when let go he goes to see another officer who has his same nightmare. Marco knows that this nightmare is true, and that Raymond is key to a plot to kill a presidential candidate with his brainwashed mind being controlled by his mother! The trigger to give Raymond orders is to make him play a game of solitaire and finding the queen of diamonds, and he will anything he is told. Thankfully in the end he is released from this brainwashing, he kills the people who made him try and do the terrible deed, including his mother, and he shoots himself. Also starring Janet Leigh as Eugenie Rose Chaney, Henry Silva as Chunjin, James Gregory as Sen. John Yerkes Iselin, Leslie Parrish as Jocelyn Jordan, John McGiver as Sen. Thomas Jordan, Khigh Dhiegh as Dr. Yen Lo and James Edwards as Cpl. Allen Melvin. Sinatra proves himself a great actor for the lead, Harvey is wonderfully creepy as the controlled assassin, and Lansbury is very sinister, more so than Meryl Streep in the remake, a very interesting conspiracy drama and psychological thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Film Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Film from any Source. Mrs. John Iselin was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes and Villains, the film was number 67 on 100 Years, 100 Movies, and it was number 17 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest political thriller, ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before sitting down to write this, I went back to take a look at my review of the remake.I was much too kind.Limiting myself to language suitable for public discourse, the remake is to the original as a third rate velvet Elvis to Michaelangelo's Last Judgment. A stain on the reputation of all concerned. A graphic illustration of the decline of Jonathan Demme as a director.I also scanned a few "1" reviews on here and can only say that they reflect either a total lack of taste, or perhaps a lack of sophistication.The Manchurian Candidate is one of the very few movies that are nearly perfect, in my estimation. Best film performance, ever, for Frank Sinatra. Perhaps the best of Angela Lansbury and one of the screen's definitive villains. My favorite Janet Leigh performance. A really astonishing performance by Lawrence Harvey, simultaneously obnoxious and pitiable. Perfect supporting cast. Cracking script by George Axelrod.What really sets this film apart from the vast majority of thrillers is its ability to evoke willing suspension of disbelief. Like any thriller, if one thinks about the plot too hard, the plot becomes absurd. The best directors of thrillers--Frankenheimer, Hitchcock--manage to keep the plot plausible by never going too far. The plot of The Manchurian Candidate bears more than a passing resemblance to Chesterton's The Man Who Was Thursday, a classic of "both sides are the same" plot. Nevertheless, the plot remain plausible, particularly in the Alice-in-Wonderland atmosphere engendered by the dream sequences and the black and white photography.Is there a great shock in the movies than when Angela Lansbury asks Lawrence Harvey to "pass the time with playing a little solitaire"? Unless it is Lawrence Harvey's final assassinations? Is these anything more disturbingly surreal that the dream sequences shifting seamlessly from garden party ladies to Soviet generals? I have seen it at least 20 times, first at its initial release. It is always fresh.See it and burn a copy of the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manchurian Candidate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An incredibly tense mystery-thriller, blessed with great performances from Frank Sinatra and Angela Lansbury.It's frightening even today so it's difficult to imagine the impact this tale of brainwashing Commies infiltrating a Senator's family must have had upon initial release, back when it was relevant and - tragically - somewhat prescient.It's shockingly violent too, even by today's standards, with Frankenheimer's camera not just showing the violence and the impact, but seemingly revelling in its detailed depiction. It's directed throughout by a man who's obviously an expert. There's no showboating but it contains many moments of quiet brilliance, most notable in the first dream sequence where the old ladies seamlessly switch characters back and forth with the Soviet military brass.Lawrence Harvey is perhaps too effective as the stone cold Shaw. The fact that there's nothing to like in the character means there's nothing to like in the performance; consequently when tragedy befalls him it's difficult to feel the sympathy one perhaps should. But if I wanted to find real things to gripe about it'd be the infamous plot holes that abound. Still, they don't really detract from the story if you don't think too much about them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>" Could there ever be anything so dark as one's own mother "</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each and every war produces it's own casualties. This movie is no different. The film is entitled " The Manchurian Candidate " and deals specifically with the physiological warfare used against U.S. soldiers in the Korean War. Hundreds of men came home complaining they could not differentiate between friend and foe. So many casualties complained of being 'Brain-washed' that a specific department was created to deal with dark memories. In this true life story, Maj. Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) is one of a handful of men from the same company as their platoon's hero, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). Like all the rest of the survivors of a doomed patrol, Marco speaks highly of the Medal of Honor recipient Raymond Shaw, to the point of reciting exactly the same praise phrases as everyone else. Little attention is given to Marco when this irregularity is brought to the attention of the Military or government authorities. However, Marco remains persistent with his allegations, when he discovers his best friend may have been hypnotically programmed to kill someone important. Angela Lansbury plays Mrs. Iselin, who assures Marco there is nothing to worry about. Henry Silva is superb as Chunjin, a bodyguard out to make sure Marco is silenced, before he discovers the truth. James Gregory and John McGiver give stirring performances to an obvious black and white suspense classic. There is Great and powerful drama in this futuristic film and none more so than to believe it could happen. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong political thriller despite bare patches</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A really super film which works and strikes deep - despite some questionable acting. I'm really loathe to add this codicil. Yet for all that I was absorbed, I had to suspend my disbelief too often.Sinatra is the prinicpal offender in this respect, although, typically, he also shows flashes of cool, menace and an adroit masculinity that makes you wish for more. Laurence Harvey's Shaw carries the picture with a characterisiation that manages to be less believable at exactly the same pace as his mind unravels (so, an indication that my misgivings are my own problem!).There is little that can be said in flat criticism of Angela Lansbury's toxic Harpy of a mother to Harvey's Shaw though. It's a unique screen performance with a steely, Jocasta-like twist at the end, entirely aligned with Lumet's own fevered satirical sensibility. Indeed it's all Lumet. For every anachronism there are two moments of fresh, sharply observed film-making which make it more than the well-hidden thriller it appears to be. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest thriller of all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a film that flawlessly gives a sensation of complete paranoia throughout. The story is highly engaging and had me on the edge of my seat the entire time. It's a very taut, tightly wound thriller that knows what it's doing every step of the way and strings the viewer along with this ambiance of paranoia and fear for what the future will bring. It really is an absolutely marvelous experience unlike anything I've ever seen. Along with this riveting thriller is a subtle satire on the morality of government that is marvelously done. It's not over-done and doesn't take any focus away from the story of Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) which is why I love it.I've heard that the film is slow-paced so I went in expecting that, but it was the complete opposite. It wrapped me up in the first scene and refused to let go until the shattering finale. The ending is breathtaking and completely stunning. I had no idea what was about to unfold before me and it had me speechless. I have no hesitation in calling Raymond Shaw the most tragic character of all time. I really connected with him and this relation made his story so much more devastating. But even if I couldn't relate to the character, his story is deeply upsetting and unnerving.It certainly helps that Laurence Harvey's performance is one of the most immersive and one of the greatest that I've ever seen. Sinatra and Angela Lansbury (who deserved her Oscar nomination) are also quite good as is the very seductive Janet Leigh. The film is very well respected in large part due to John Frankenheimer's original direction and unique angles which are ingenious. He crafts a marvelous thriller that is among the best I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Never Get Tired of Watching This Superb Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there one word to describe "The Manchurian Candidate?" Certainly there are several contenders: audacious, macabre, stark, gripping, pulpy, morbid, dark, hilarious. The film so stubbornly resists categorization that it's all of these things at one point or another, and frequently several of these things all at once.I don't know what audiences made of this film at the time of its release, though, according to accounts, it bombed at the box office, primarily because it was pulled from theatres when life (the assassination of JFK) too closely imitated art. Add its prophetic quality to the list of reasons that "The Manchurian Candidate" deserves its unique place in cinema history and should be seen by everyone.Director John Frankenheimer was at the top of his game here. His genius with this film resulted from his realization that the source material was pure camp, so he treats it as such. This same story played straight would have landed with a bone-crunching thud (as it did in the 2004 remake). But Frankenheimer injects the film with liberal doses of ghoulish humor, so the film ends up being grotesque and funny at the same time. For a premier example of this, refer to the brainwashing flashbacks sprinkled throughout the first half of the film, that through some of the most cracker jack editing ever done on screen juxtapose a deadly demonstration and a convention of female botanists to nightmarish and shocking effect.And of course, no review of "Candidate" would be complete without mentioning the supremely harrowing performance of Angela Lansbury, who lords magisterially over the film and will drive all memories of Jessica Fletcher right out your head. If this film were a deck of cards, she'd be all four queens rolled into one.Grade: A+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clearing up some misinformation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, let me say that this is my favorite film. It has flaws, which I imagine most films do after their 10th viewing or so. The film was not pulled from circulation after JFK was assassinated, it had run it's course in the theaters months earlier. It was shown at least two times that I know of before it's re-release in 1988: on NBC in 1975 ( I have the TV guide) and in 1979 in an appreciation of film class at college of Marin. It was not re-released in theaters because until 1988, Sinatra didn't realize he dad the rights (he says this on his special feature interview on the DVD).Harvey was chosen after Tony Curtis was considered. It was thought that Harvey's British accent (even though he's a Lithuanian Jew) could be tempered( if you've seen him in other films, his accent in TMC is definitely not as 'British' as he's capable of)and also, Lansbury, who played his mother had a slight British/New England accent. Frankenheimer also says in the commentary that since JFK had an odd accent, Harvey's would not seem that odd.Janet Leigh's character is in keeping with her character in the book although not as fleshed out. If it were, I think most viewers would not suspect her intentions. Frankly, I never thought she was that odd. Most films of that era hooked up the main actor with the "girl" who's primary function was to be the "girl" and support the main actor.Finally, the remake bears only faint resemblance to either the novel or the first film. It would have been far better if they had given it a different name to avoid the inevitable comparisons,</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Satanic Lansbury Dominates a Prescient, Still Mesmerizing Masterwork</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those who only know Angela Lansbury from her Disney connection and her twelve years as TV's Jessica Fletcher, her bold, brilliant turn as the Machiavellian Mrs. Iselin, a role alarmingly slated for Lucille Ball, will startle you. It's a powerhouse performance in a velvet glove, and she is but one of the fascinating characters in John Frankenheimer's prescient, off-balance 1962 masterwork. Obviously a scathing indictment of McCarthyism which has reached mythic proportions, this taut political thriller initially revolves around a platoon brainwashed by Soviet and Chinese officials after their capture in Korea. The plot then settles on two of the soldiers ? one is Raymond Shaw, a Congressional Medal of Honor winner, whose mother craves power for her Joe McCarthy-like senator husband; the other is Captain Bennett Marco who is haunted by jarring nightmares about the interrogations and a nagging feeling about Shaw. Their story lines eventually merge but not before several unpredictable turns that leads to a breathtaking last half-hour.The writing by veteran scribe George Axelrod (based on Richard Condon's 1959 novel) is shrewd without ever tipping the story's surprising denouement. Of all people, Frank Sinatra plays Marco with often dynamic conviction, though I think he plays the role a bit more heroically and less ambiguously than he should have. Laurence Harvey, on the other hand, plays Shaw, the film's most difficult role, effectively teetering on the cusp of insanity throughout. But hands down, the movie belongs to Lansbury. Whether belittling her buffoonish husband or icily explaining her motivation for attaining power to her son, she refuses to chew scenery and lets the sharp dialogue spew right out of her pouty mouth.Smaller roles are filled interestingly though not entirely successfully. Janet Leigh has a smallish part as Marco's love interest, the best part of which is her seductive pick-up scene on the train. As Iselin, James Gregory captures the bluster and innate naivet of a character about to be devoured by his far sharper wife. The stunning Leslie Parrish, an actress who never fulfilled her initial promise, plays Shaw's beloved Josey with a Monroe-like combination of innocence and sensuality. I just wish there was more complexity to Leigh's and Parrish's characters. There are a couple of casting errors ? comic character actor John McGiver overdoing it as Iselin's liberal nemesis, Senator Jordan, and Henry Silva, made up as a Korean, as Shaw's manservant Chunjin, who has a wild kung fu fight with Sinatra.Frankenheimer paces the film beautifully and Lionel Lindon's cinematography tightens the close-ups of the characters as the action escalates. The 2004 Special Edition DVD has several extras though none all that outstanding. Frankenheimer's commentary is unfortunately sparse but interesting when he does speak. There is an eight-minute three-way conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer and Axelrod filmed in 1988 ? too short but interesting, especially for the insight provided on why the film was pulled from circulation after JFK's assassination a year after it was released. Two rather perfunctory featurettes are included ? one focused on Lansbury with the actress participating, and the other on Frankenheimer but only with commentary from director William Friedkin. Regardless, the film is a must-see for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Manchurian Candidate" Mama Was Never Like This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a chilling psychological thriller about the brainwashing of captured soldiers during the Korean War and the aftermath of it.Our protagonist is Laurence Harvey, head of the unit, who emerges as a war hero. Yet, he can't understand why he is having such terrible nightmares. Little does he know that other members of the unit are experiencing similar dreams.Frank Sinatra gives wonderful support in this thriller. Janet Leigh, in a too-brief part, is excellent as Sinatra's newly found girlfriend.However, it is Angela Lansbury, as Harvey's mother, who steals the show acting wise. In a brutal, vicious portrayal of a mother who organized the whole plot, Lansbury turned in a sensational Oscar nominated performance for best supporting actress. It could only have taken the phenomenal Patty Duke in "The Miracle Worker" to beat her out. Lansbury's portrayal is one of the most vicious mothers we have ever experienced in motion pictures.You will enjoy this classic film very much, even as the dead bodies begin to pile up. John Frankenheimer did a superb job of directing this **** film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect mix of intrigue, suspense, style, humor and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`The Manchurian Candidate' is the best political thriller?ever. Really, nothing before or since can really match up to the excitement, intrigue and verve of this film. All elements; the acting, the direction, the script, it's all perfect. The film itself is near perfect.The plot starts with Bennet Marco (Frank Sinatra) and a group of soldiers - including Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) - in the middle of a trek through Korea when their guide Chunjin (Henry Silva) betrays them and they are captured. Flash forward a few years and we have Shaw accepting the medal of honor for valiantly rescuing the rest of the group from their pickle (all but two casualties). Marco recommended it, but he secretly believes that not all is as it seems, and he doesn't quite trust Raymond Shaw. I wont go any further, all I'll say is that it involves communism and Shaw's extremely right-wing mother Eleanor (Angela Lansbury) and her vice presidential candidate husband (James Gregory).The way director John Frankenheimer and screen writer John Axelrod create intrigue and suspense is delicious. A very strange dream sequence that Marco has, the surprise reappearance of Chunjin, the strange fixation on the game solitaire. We're practically drawn to the screen as more and more is revealed.The acting is terrific. Frank Sinatra has a sort of style that makes him more likable and less freakily neurotic than your usual run of the mill conspiracy theorist. Harvey's performance - basically a leading role - is one of the best in the movie, if not the best. He is a pessimistic, cynical man who loathes himself almost as much as he loathes his domineering mother. His performance reaches a peak when he tells Sinatra about a time when he was once `lovable', a summer when he fell in love with the daughter of a rival senator to his mother. His mother, predictably, ended the relationship, causing Harvey to give up on himself. But he's not completely hopeless, and he tries to do the right thing and stand up to his mother at one point, a goal ending tragically.If Harvey's performance isn't the best than Lansbury's definitely is. She is a horrifying mother, probably the scariest mother in movie history. Her manipulations and mind games on her poor son (and others) are the harshest I've ever seen in a movie. She has absolutely no empathy for her son, he is just a tool for her to use in her schemes and agendas. When she expresses sorrow and guilt in a late scene we begin to sympathize with her, but she tears it all down with a disturbing new development that completes the whole story arch with Harvey and Lansbury: at this point we understand completely all the reasons he s his mother.It has some delightfully cool touches too. The solitaire aspect is awesomely delivered. We even have a fast, energetic martial arts match between Marco and Chunjin. It's things like this that make the movie both intriguing and fun.By the ending there has been a resolution, but we think that maybe, just maybe, there is still an evil lurking under the surface. It is never verified, but I'd like to think that there is something still afoot, and not much has been resolved. If you desperately want a happy ending, think otherwise, you have a choice, thanks to Axelrod.A landmark in thrillers, copied by many, matched by none, 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true classic, the prototype for the lesser-explored genre of "political thriller." I had never heard of this film until 1988, when Sinatra re-released the rights to it. At the time, I was in Chicago, and dragged a friend to a theatre to see it. The next night I went back with another friend, and the next night after that, I went by myself. This is the ONLY film I have ever gone to a movie theatre to see three times in a row, three days in a row. It has been with me ever since. Arguably it is one of the best films ever made; top-notch acting, superb direction, riveting story. If you ever get an opportunity to see this film in a theatre, in the dark on a big screen, do so.See the original before you see the remake. Remember when Hollywood remade 1963's "The Haunting" in 1995 or so? BAAAAADDDDD....But back to the Manchurian Candidate. It is a film that introduces many questions as it tells its story; it is a fascinating, complex study of psychology and politics, and it is a forever-frozen-in-time moment of a depiction of American life in the early 1960s. It is a film that opinions and discussions will continue on for as long as the participants can muster...so many interesting observations and angles presented.While all the acting is excellent, Angela Lansbury's performance is the one that stayed with me that night when I left that small theatre in Illinois, and though it is rare to find female characters in classic films in such magnanimous positions of power, her performance undoubtedly will go down in history as one of the best, if not the best, of such performances. No one has come close.Many, many great comments about the film are contained in these summaries and on the message boards, attesting to the film's stamina and excellence. But if you've not seen it, do yourself the favor of watching it first...maybe even two or three times, as there are so many details to pick up on, then come in here and read through all the interesting observations, peruse the message boards and join the discussions. You'll find you'll learn so much more about the film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great movie. It starts out, slowly at first. It builds the suspense by showing you the various pieces of the puzzle, and then starts to put them together right before your eyes (this is done so seamlessly). Frank Sinatra plays the role of the Capt. Marco (soon to be Major). He adequately portrays the role of the officer with a "loose" memory. I don't think the terror aspect of brainwashing came out as much in his performance, as it should have. The two outstanding performances definitely belong to Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey. Everyone who thinks of Angela (Raymond's mother) as the nice, old granny fiction mystery writer from New England, is in for a surprise. She is manipulative, accusatory and quite pushy. Laurence Harvey plays the Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Raymond Shaw (who returns from the Korean War a hero). This movie was made prior to the death of JFK and several years after the McCarthy era. In a way, it deals with both those elements in a fictitious yet realistic and quite plausible manner (very much relevant even now). The film has very much a film noir quality in the choice of scenery, lighting and the mood. This film is dark and cynical in its portrayal of patriotism, politics and human behavior. After a while, the toned down performances of most of the actors, seem to put you in a "brainwashed" state. You don't feel .. you just sit there and watch .. helpless. This is juxtaposed with the subtle yet visibly humorous performance of New Jersey born actor Khigh Dhiegh (Dr. Lo - the washer) and the over-the-top nonsensical actions of Raymond's stepfather Senator (played by James Gregory). The ending is the shock to wake us up from the slumber and get us thinking for ourselves again. This movie should be watched by all &lt;period&gt;.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After hearing a lot of good things about this film over the past couple of years, I finally got a chance to watch it ? and haven't been able to stop raving about it ever since. The Manchurian Candidate is about a platoon of soldiers from the Korean War who, after strange occurrences and having repeated nightmares that are eerily similar, realize a decade later that something horrible may have happened during their tour of duty. The story itself is first-rate - compelling, thrilling and intelligent. One of the most phenomenal aspects of this film is that theme is completely terrifying, yet there are no cheap thrills to back it up. The dream sequences are horrifying because they are straight forward, not because of standard horror imagery. Frankenheimer's genius lies in the fact that he can take these kinds of scenes and weave them with the Red Scare theme without being heavy-handed.Probably one of the more humorous aspects of the film, and this isn't anything intentional of course, is the fact that the generations who only know Angela Lansbury as the mild-mannered (a vaguely irritating) Jessica Fletcher from `Murder She Wrote' will be surprised to see her role in this film, because she is the embodiment of evil. An entirely new generation will be able to see another interpretation of The Manchurian Candidate that has been remade by Jonathan Demme and stars Denzel Washington in the Frank Sinatra role. From what I have seen by the trailer, there seems to be some major theme changes, which can be somewhat excused due to the topical nature of the original. However, I think it will be hard pressed to even come close to matching the original because Frankenheimer's version is an intense, relevant and incredibly intelligent film. This is film is definitely a must-see if you haven't already experienced it.--Shelly</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a political thriller to match "Notorious" and nearly as taut a satire as "Dr. Stangelove." The latter has more black humor, but The Manchurian Candidate has quite a bit of dry wit beneath its tense exterior. Expertly made, this film presents several plot twists but manages to make the surface story easily manageable.Beneath the suspenseful story of Sgt. Raymond Shaw and Major Ben Marco, underlining concepts become apparent. Along with there platoon, the two men are captured during the Korean War. The men are brainwashed by Russian and Chinese doctors and officers. Shaw is the focus. He seems to have qualities desirable for an unconscious assassin. The plot swerves from here, as Marco becomes both advocate and opposition to Shaw. Senator and Mrs. Iselin(Shaw's stepfather and mother) are tools for lampoonery. McCarthyism is attacked by comparisons of it and the unsubstantiated accusations of communism made by the Senator, who is probed to make them by his wife. It is a direct attack on a known fallible idea but also assails other less obvious evils of politics: Especially those associated with elections.The subplot hardest to understand completely is the love affair between Major Marco and the woman he meets on a train, Rosie. The scene in which they meet hints at the idea that Rosie is an operative for the enemy. This theory never materializes, but this may be purposeful, to add mystique to an already remarkable movie.Angela Lansbury is quite dislikable as Shaw's mother, Lawrence Harvey is a perfect brainwashed zombie as Sgt. Raymond Shaw, James Gregory plays a drunken puppet well as Senator Iselin, and Frank Sinatra surprises with a complex role as Major Marco. The supporting actors give stellar performances as well. The Manchurian Candidate thrills, enthralls, and stirs imagination.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. I know, it got great reviews everywhere and is on about every top 100 list you can find. Still, I have seen other highly acclaimed movies from the past and been let down. Before seeing this movie, I thought maybe Sinatra actually wouldn't watch it for years because he didn't think it was that good, not because the JFK stuff hurt him too much, as was reported. I don't think that anymore, because there is really no way to say that this movie isn't good. One unique thing about The Manchurian Candidate is that it really does feel modern. The writing is also witty and insightful and superb. The acting, particularly from the supposed war hero, is outstanding. Satire, suspense, greed for power, love, a little action, it's all here. 9--not 10--out of 10, mainly because we have seen the political assassination stuff so much by now--The Dead Zone, etc.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a great movie this was. I don't think it ever got it's just due until it's re-release in 1988. It was a victim of bad timing, having been released less than a year before the assassination of President Kennedy. Oddly enough, the asssasin in the film is played by Lawrence Harvey, L. Harvey. That's kind of eerie.Sinatra was terrific in this film, and so was Harvey in the role of the detestable Raymond Shaw, who Sinatra and the audience come to understand and feel sorry for. Sure, he's a jerk. But his spy of a mother (played by what's her name from MURDER SHE WROTE) not only broke up the only thing in the world that brought him happiness (his love of Jocelyn) but is also a Russian spy who built an assasin out of her own traumatized son.I always feel bad when I watch the movie and Sinatra gives his little speech in the end about the courage of Raymond Shaw. It still holds up today as an outstanding thriller complete with a smirking humor about the Red Scare and satire that may have been overlooked by audiences in 1962. One of Frankenheimer's best. Try to remember him for this and not REINDEER GAMES.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A trippy and unusual film, this will rank as one of my favorite mind-bending films which intend to confuse the viewer. While Frank Sinatra was a relatively poor actor, he turned in a strong performance which should rank as his best (even better than From Here to Eternity).Laurence Harvey was exceptional, taking up the screen with his silent and awkward appearance. The conference scene near the middle of the film was one of the most jarring and confusing moments in cinema history, creating so much confusion and intrigue, the scene makes up or any mistakes the film might have exhibited. One of those rare war films which have very little to do with actual physical battle, but battles within the mind. John Frankenheimer's best film ever, period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everybody who served with SSgt. Raymond Shaw in Korea says that he was "the kindest, bravest, warmest, most wonderful human being I've ever known in my life," but about that statement doesn't ring true to those men, particularly to Maj. Bennett Marco, who keeps having a recurring nightmare related to Raymond and the other men in his unit.Simply put, "The Manchurian Candidate" is not like any movie before or since, and is still as relevent and chilling today as it was in 1962 when the film was released. It's even more remarkable that this great film wasn't seen widely for 25 years, therefore lost to the world for that time.Since its re-release in 1987, the film has received its just-do as great movie, with its performances, cinematography, writing and direction be cited. The best performance is given by Angela Lansbury, Raymond's power-hungry mother.To give out more information would not be prudent, in my opinion. It is truly a must-see film by anybody who calls themselves a movie fan.</fullReview>

One of them, Lawrence Harvey (Raymond Shaw) is hypnotized to believe the Red Queen controls their destiny. He is programmed by his mother (Angela Lansbury) to assassinate a Presidential candidate.Another officer, played wonderfully by Frank Sinatra, realizes Harvey is being controlled. Once he convinces army brass, he must convince Harvey."The Manchurian Candidate" came out in 1962. Within 18 months, JFK was assassinated. It is one of the best thrillers of all time. 4 stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most haunting movies ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a sort of chill that consumes me whenever I think about this movie. It's shocking, it's thrilling, it's surreal, it's sad...just about everything. I didn't know that Frank Sinatra could act so well. He gave an outstanding performance here. His range was remarkable. He goes from loud to reserved to confused to depressed to in love, etc. All the acting here is just top notch.Laurence Harvey's Raymond is cold, angry and very bitter. Consider one of the earlier scenes with his mother in the airplane, where he doesn't even try to mask his contempt for his mother and step-father. When asked what he and his employer have in common by he replies: "We found that we both loath and despise you and Johnny!" However, he isn't as cold as he seems. There is a dark secret inside him, one so dark he doesn't even know it himself. He has been brainwashed to be a killing machine. Whenever he plays solitare and sees the Red Queen, he goes into a trance where he'll kill anyone they want him to and have no memory of it, and therefor, no guilt. Now, hard as this may be to believe, there is also a very soft side we eventually discover. "I'm not lovable. But to her I was." He's referring of course to Josie, the love of his life, which his mother destroyed. He then becomes sad and depressed over his lost love. I could talk for days simply on his character because there are so many levels to him, so many chambers of his mind that I could explore.As a political thriller it works brilliantly. The corruption of the Johnny, the fear of communists infiltrating the government, the lies, the under the table deals, the scams. All of it makes for an intense thriller. What makes it even greater is the threat and suspense created by Raymond, because we don't know who they'll have him kill next, and who's telling him to kill whom. But for me, what pushes this movie over the top is the Angela Lansbury character. This isn't some nice tea pot, or the crafty old woman from "Murder She Wrote." The thing that is so great about this character is that while the character of Noah Cross in "Chinatown" will forever remain as the most chilling father figure in a film (a good runner up would be the Donald Sutherland character of 2000's "Panic") Lansbury's character is the most despicable, horrid mother character I've ever seen. No question. Imagine if the two of them had married, what kind of a family they might have produced. But she alone is enough to make us cringe all throughout this film."The Manchurian Candidate" is a magnificent political thriller, yet it is so emotional and the characters so interesting, so varried and so well acted by everyone in the movie, it is simply one of the best films of all time. Once you see this movie, you will not be able to get it out of your mind because of how rich the dialogue is, all that is lost in it, all that takes place, and all that is represented here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two powerful climatic sequences at the end of the film that had my palms sweating. This is a superb, intelligent movie that perhaps could have used a more commercial name and a little less of the main character explaining everything to the audience routine.Sinatra is very believable in his role, and he definitely carries the look of someone who has endured the torture and pain. Co-actor Laurence Harvey, who looked to me a lot like a young Clint Eastwood, also does a good job of playing the snobbish soldier with an even worse predicament. And Angela Lansbury, playing Harvey's mother, gives a career-highlight performance.I'm a big fan of poetry, and the strong symbolism achieved through the use of the deck of cards was intriguing, which worked perfectly within the whole theme of brainwashing. No doubt the filmmakers picked an utterly fascinating topic which could have been taken in so many directions as to lose focus of the plot but rather chose to focus on the Oedipal relationship between the unwilling killer and his conniving mother.The film does lag however in the scene where Sinatra and Janet Leigh first meet, and I still can't understand why she was included in the story.10 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best political thriller ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best thing about political thrillers, in my opinion, is the paranoia that they both portray and generate in their audiences. And `The Manchurian Candidate' has paranoia in spades. Or perhaps I should say diamonds. That is, no one who has seen the film will ever look at solitaire or a deck of cards the same way again. And certainly brainwashing, a frightening concept in itself, has never been as palpably realized as it is here. The original ad for the film reads: `If you come in five minutes after this picture begins, you won't know what it's all about! When you've seen it all, you'll swear there's never been anything like it!' How true. But the genius of film lies in several distinct aspects.The disturbingly prophetic tone of `The Manchurian Candidate,' which was released in 1962, was shatteringly validated when President Kennedy was assassinated less than a year later. It caused so much fervor that the film was banned from theaters for the next 25 years. Aside from the story, the dialogue is crisp and to the point.The second major aspect of the film that bears mentioning is the acting. Sinatra is in top form here, lending a mesmerizing intensity to Bennett. Harvey is chilling as the brainwashed Shaw, while Lansbury delivers a knockout performance as his mother that earned her an Oscar nomination.The real genius of the film, however, lies in the directing, cinematography and editing. The brainwashing dream sequence is one of the most talked-about and highly praised sequences in editing, while several other camera shots are so far ahead of their time that they are just now coming into their own. Director John Frankenheimer (who later directed `Ronin') keeps the pace moving at breakneck speed towards the shattering, mind-blowing conclusion.If you're looking for something to blow you away, something completely unlike anything you've seen before, check out `The Manchurian Candidate.' It has aged well, still providing the same amount of suspense and drama that it did then. In fact, it's so good, it was recently named to the American Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest American Films, where it placed 67. A thrilling film, topped by an explosive climax, it's one not to be missed.</fullReview>

In my opinion it ranks up there with Citizen Kane and a handful of other complex, multi-layered and ground breaking films that crop up all too infrequently. Released in 1962 and shot in black-and-white it still grabs the viewer and won't let go until the final credits roll.I won't waste space rehashing the plot, or waxing enthusiastic on the acting and directing.

		<fullReview>If your exposure to Angela Lansbury consists entirely of "Murder, She Wrote", you'd better have a good stiff drink before you watch this film. She is absolutely chilling as the ruthless senator's wife who has an agenda of her own. It's hard to understand how she didn't win Best Supporting Actress for this film, and even harder to understand why she was billed under Janet Leigh, who doesn't show up until halfway through the film and is more or less peripheral to the action. As for the rest of the cast, I don't like Frank Sinatra as an actor, but in this film he's at least tolerable. Lawrence Harvey is very good, and the supporting cast is solid.Part of the film was based on the McCarthy debacle of the fifties, but what makes it truly frightening is how some of its central themes--how easily the press and the public can be manipulated, the ruthlessness of American politics--are still relevant today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Overall great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely one of the top 50 movies ever produced. Even if you do not view too many 'classic' films, this film represents the 'classic' genre very well &amp; will most definitely entice any viewer to select other 'classic' films on a more regular basis. If you have seen "Citizen Kane", for instance, you will definitely like this movie -- if you have not seen either, I would suggest a trip to your local video store.Although this film would be classified as a 'spy thriller', it is more deserving of a 'psychological thriller' and includes a few twists &amp; turns to pull the viewer deeper into the movie. Another term such as 'political thriller' could also be used in today's culture, as this film serves as an eerie precursor on how the general public perceives politicians behave behind the scenes. There is also an unhidden attempt to ride the anti-McCarthyism train, which fits very well into the plot, without overshadowing any other aspects of the film.The Director's presentation of the film can only be rated as excellent, with an extraordinarily unique scene in the first 20 minutes of the film -- the fact that this scene is the theme for the entire movie serves to increase its effect even moreso. If you liked the opening sequence in "The Player", you will definitely enjoy this scene.There are some slight problems with acting, although not blatant enough to take away from the film. The only other negative thing that could be said (which may have caused some of the minor acting flaws) is that the dialogue seemed a bit stale and didn't flow well at times, but again, these instances are more than overpowered by the rest of the film's dialogue, which keeps the viewer pulled in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Evil Comedy: One of the Greatest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know there will be a lot of kvetching about this, but this 1962 film was way, way, WAY ahead of it's time and just as way over the heads of the audience, and indeed, the whole world society that viewed it.Starting off with hypnotized POW combat soldiers doing needlepoint.The dream sequences are the core of the movie. They are asides to the audience which ask "Do you really believe this? How silly is this?" If you think our collective intellect in the US has caught up with this, go look at some political forum where there are (incredibly) still so many red-baiters or individuals who are afraid the free enterprise system is collapsing, even now, with billionaires in Russia and China. We know how many of us have read "Mein Kampf" or "The Communist Manifesto", or smoked a doobie (and inhaled, although with today's improved marijuana, you hardly even have to do that to get totally zonked!), but we are still so intellectually primitive and hypocritical in this country that we can't admit it without fear of being slandered as a subversive or a threat to society. Yet we have the first president and vice-president who were actually arrested before they took office, and the first president who was ever known to have used cocaine. His political strength was gained mostly by calling the other party socialists and communists long enough and loud enough. This movie is about anti-communist insanity. It laughed in our faces, but still we took it seriously, just like the guy who says he never beat his wife but he used to punch her down all the time....Those who made the film laughed all the way to the bank.The United States is still sick from the irrational fear of social equality posed by socialist thinkers. Even as I write this, the US is still in the grip of this hysteria, and to that extent the comedy in this movie is still relevant. It is indeed a classic of the cinema, but most people don't have a fig of an idea what it's about. They don't even come close to "getting it". Almost every character in the movie was an avowed opponent of Mc Carthyism. The whole thing was tongue in cheek. What's doubly interesting, however, about the plot of this story also makes a good template for a straight ahead political suspense thriller, focusing real attention on the workings of a government not unlike the current Bush/Republican administration; but then you could make anyone the bad guys. In addition to the Communists or insane right wingers, the "bad guys" could be the National Rifle Association, the Red Cross or the Lost Boys of Never Never Land. A political thriller is what the public bought as the original, although it was clearly NOT intended that way. The remake is actually what this 1962 original was mistaken for, kind of like "Destry Rides Again" to "Blazing Saddles", only in this version, the comedy came first, then the more serious version.</fullReview>

Immediately after his assassination, Frank Sinatra, who starred in and produced the film, banned it from any further screenings. Nobody saw it again until 1988.

		<fullReview>I picked up the Special Edition DVD of "The Manchurian Candidate" because I kept hearing it was a classic, and felt it would be a good addition to my collection. I'm a huge fan of John Frankenheimer ("Seconds" is one of the most underrated and un-acknowledged films of all time in my opinion) and his directorial style here is just as distinct as always: the cold distances, the skewed close-ups, etc. His presence is in every frame, and I continue to be baffled by the fact that even many film critics don't consider him to be a great director.Frank Sinatra gives a worthy performance, although it is inferior to Denzel Washington's in the remake. Angela Lansbury is totally creepy and convincing but the real scene-stealer is Laurence Harvey. As in the remake, it's his character who is the most fascinating, multi-layered and believable - Harvey gives a terrific performance (and Shriever, too, in the remake), which is unforgettable.Overall this is a classic movie and it still holds up well today - it's a big step forward for film-making (violence, swearing, and sexual content in a 1960s film that certainly paved the way for the movies of the '70s), and from its performances to direction to script to entertainment value, it's an A+ all around.Highly recommended. 5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>That rare movie where you see it and you're still thinking about it the next day. Incredible casting - even the smaller roles. I think Angela Lansberry steals the show with her performance as the the mother from hell. I have actually read some put down remarks about the acting of Lawrence Harvey, but in my opinion he was outstanding as Raymond Shaw. I really don't see how any other actor could have played the role better. And until I saw this movie, I never realized what a great actor Frank Sinatra was(he once remarked that singing was basically acting - no doubt that is true). I have read the book, but in this case I think the movie was better. Kudos to George Axelrod for his great screenplay based on the book. Frankenheimer is probably the one of the most underrated(or at least not known to most of the public) directors of all time. But this is his greatest achievement. The movie is very tightly written and edited - the story always moves forward.If you have never seen this movie, don't see the remake first. If you do, you will get the basic plot line and that will ruin it when you see the original.This movie is a real mindblower!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Viewed today 'The Manchurian Candidate' still stands out as a brilliant film. John Frankenheimer directed some very good films but this is his masterpiece, with a great screenplay by George Axelrod from Richard Condon's book. It is almost like a black comedy but of the darkest kind. The politics, the paranoia, the pathos and the power plays are effectively brewed together to make a heady experience. It is also brave enough to have a bleak ending. The film doesn't lift your heart. It is an insight into the grim undercurrents of life, still relevant after forty years.There are some justly celebrated sequences that still take the breath away. The dream segment is amazing. The camera movement, the cutting, the decor are all superb. It is a chilling scene because it takes normality and twists it slowly until the two moments of violence almost become acceptable. There is a great fight scene later between Sinatra and Henry Silva that still thrills. The ending of the film at the convention is staged magnificently. One runs out of superlatives.The same could be said for the acting. Sinatra is believable as the intelligent and haunted major. The possible doubtful casting of Laurence Harvey as Raymond Shaw pays off, even with his accent. His account of his love affair is very moving. He is a rounded character. Angela Lansbury as his mother is amazingly good. She has played unsympathetic roles but never like this. She is unforgettable. And scary! I'm not sure that the Janet Leigh character works but apart from her the smaller roles are well played. Khigh Dhiegh as the smiling Dr. Yen Lo epitomises the ambiguity and treachery of the people in power. The only very minor quibble is the portentous narration at the beginning which I thought could be dispensed. A magnificent film and unsurpassed.From IMBd it appears that a re-make is in the offing.

		<fullReview>What a great movie. How many movies have DOZENS of memorable scenes? You only need one hand to count them all, but this is surely one of them. Its hard to discuss this without revealing major plot points, so stop here if you don't want to know..Laurence Harvey. Frank Sinatra. Two vastly different acting styles have some amazing moments together, not the least of which is when Bennett Marco (Sinatra) breaks the 'links' that have been brainwashed ('installed' is more like it)into Raymond Shaw's (Harvey) head. This is done so that he will become the killer his jewel of a mother (more on her later) ordered. Laurence Harvey is usually a heel in everything else - reference "Butterfield 8" and "Darling" and here he is, by his own definition, 'unlovable.' But he does find true love and actually smiles on screen! To top that, he cracks a joke! But this makes his downfall all the more poignant, as Mother is still in charge. So she uses him to kill his wife and father-in-law (John McGiver) who is a direct threat to Mother's pawn/husband, John Iselin, getting a Vice Presidential nomination.Angela Lansbury is amazing as Raymond's mother. She got an Oscar nomination and if Patty Duke would not have been more amazing in "The Miracle Worker", Lansbury would've captured the gold. She is unforgettable and shows more sides than a monster normally does. When she tells Raymond she did not know he would be the killer she needed, you believe her. But she's a woman on a mission, so if it has to be her son that contributes to her crusade, so be it. I disagree with the reviews below that suggest Janet Leigh's role is tacked-on or unimportant. True, her character does not contribute to the plot at all, but Leigh's confidence in her role and her sense of humor is appreciated in a relentlessly cold and dark movie like this. When she says upon meeting Marco on a train, 'I was one of the original Chinese workers who laid this track', she's apparently more than 'the girl.' She and Sinatra have some great chemistry in their three/four scenes together. Great &amp; memorable scenes abound. Great acting and story and delivery. This one has it all, and is a timeless classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can this really be a thriller? I'd always thought that thrillers might be great entertainment but couldn't be great movies, yet this one led me to alter my opinion. The only other ones I can call to mind are the very best Hitchcocks like Vertigo.If you're not American, you might at first imagine that a lot of the movie would be lost on you (Korean war, McCarthy references, Abraham Lincoln). Well I didn't particularly know a great deal about any of these, but actually it doesn't at all detract from enjoying and appreciating the film. If anything it heightens the paranoia. If you don't know too much about the background, you can imagine anything could happen.Wonderfully atmospheric - I can't think of another movie that induces paranoiac feeling in the audience as well. This comes to a head when Marco meets Rosie on the train - and I think that is the reason why Janet Leigh's character was included. It's so well handled. Their first comments could be flirtatious chat-up lines or they could be passwords to recognise each other. Even when Rosie says something not quite right, and Marco tells her: you should have said..., we are not sure whether this means she is an opposing agent who knew only part of the intro routine.A lot of people commented on the wonderful techniques that compare with the very best, especially the swirling camera-work, and the uniformly excellent acting. Few people mentioned the score, which (in my humble opinion), is one of the best of all time, beautiful but somehow heightening the tension. It tends to appear just before you are going to become even more paranoiac and is part of the movie's subtle conditioning I think.All in all this is a most excellent movie and very enjoyable too. It was placed around position 60 in the American Film Institute top 100, but personally I would have put it about 30 higher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Conspiracy Glitchs 101</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I agree with all the praise I have seen in regards to "The Manchurian Candidate" (one of JFK's favorite movies, so I'm told; ironic that he apparently lived out his own version of the tale, yes?), I still feel like that there is one point about the film that is easy to miss. To wit, what all can go wrong with conspiracies. A flaw that I have seen in too many conspiracy theories I've heard is the suggestion that everything went according to the grand design of the plan. There is always one vital element missing in such theories as this: human error.So MANY things go wrong with the great Communist takeover portrayed here. For starters, there's the nightmares that haunt Sinatra's sleep, clueing him into the conspiracy to begin with. The tryout killing of Raymond's boss, unnecessarily taking a risk that raises the profile of the conspirators. Someone at a bar suggesting Raymond play solitaire and then mentions offhand (with Raymond on the Red Queen, of course) for the guy he's talking to to go jump in a lake (which Raymond promptly does). Raymond's would-be girlfriend wearing the Red Queen card the night Raymond is under orders, breaking the spell. Sinatra figuring out Raymond's trigger circuit for the brainwashing program. Finally, there's Raymond himself, full of pain and self-loathing so intense that when he finally finds an outlet for it, he dives in...headfirst. When he loaded his final three bullets, there was no question in my mind who the targets would be. Pay attention to the whole film from beginning to end and I doubt one would fail to realize what they are.Now, on the subject of Janet Leigh's admittedly nothing role, I believe that her purpose is to be what is called in mysteries "a red herring". What that is is something that looks like it's important enough to be a clue, but actually isn't. By the time she's introduced, my paranoia level was running sky-high. It's one thing to know who the bad guys are; it's another to not know who's working for them and who isn't. Therefore, you wondering if she has anything to do with what's going down. I can certainly think of no other reason why Leigh was in there.In conclusion, while "The Manchurian Candidate" does anticipate the paranoia of the '90s, one of it's more important lessons lies in realizing the pitfalls of all grand conspiracies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A perfect suspense film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot comment about the similarities or dissimilarities between this film and its recent remake. That's because the original film was so perfect, so exciting, so well acted and written, there was no reason for a remake and there is no conceivable way any remake could have improved on the original story--it was THAT good! The story begins in a Chinese Communist indoctrination camp as an officer demonstrates how thoroughly he has indoctrinated a group of American POWs from the Korean War. Then, suddenly, the scene changes to America years later. The brainwashed prisoners are now home and have no idea that their minds were changed. I'd say more, but don't want to ruin the suspense. All I really want to say is that Angela Lansbury does NOT play a nice character like "Mrs. Potts" in this film. In fact, she is at her most evil and amazing. Additionally, Frank Sinatra has one of his finest on-screen performances in this amazing film. It's a must-see--it's THAT good!This is yet another amazing drama from director John Frankenheimer. See this and try some of his other brilliant films such as SEVEN DAYS IN MAY and SECONDS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough, talky thriller shows the audience little mercy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Conspiracy thriller directed by John Frankenheimer from Richard Condon's novel about troop of Army soldiers returning home from combat, each plagued by nightmares and nagging paranoia, and for good reason: while overseas, they were kidnapped and brainwashed...with one soldier turned into a killer. Talky, sometimes confusing film made riveting by first-rate performances from Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury and a sweat-inducing climax. Janet Leigh's role doesn't add up to much, and the two-minute tag at the end is wholly unnecessary (it muffles the movie's impact), but otherwise quite good. Kept out of circulation for years due to similarities with the assassination of President Kennedy in 1963; remade in 2004 by director Jonathan Demme. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen this movie several times since it first came out. I now realize it stinks. The only thing I liked was the "portal" into the world of 50 years ago. Otherwise the plot doesn't hang together at all. First, we're supposed to believe that it is somehow "the Right" who are the Communists. No doubt this was due to the media's acceptance at the time of the anti-anti-Communist stance. By this viewpoint the anti-Communists were the "real Communists". The real-real Communists--the Soviets, Chinese, Cubans, etc.--were misunderstood builders of paradise. The "real Communists" were buffoons like James Gregory's character who make up conspiracies as easily as Heinz makes ketchup. Gregory's character is clearly based on Joe McCarthy and the movie repeats the media trope that he just pulled the number of commies (in the State Department, not Defense) out of thin air (Heinz' 57 for 57 Communists). Second, we are to asked to believe the Communists, clever enough to program human beings, would be so clumsy as to place one of their human robot assassins close to the very person they are trying to get installed as President? Seems unlikely especially considering that when Laurance Harvey kills John McGiver, he is in a zombie like state and thus not too attentive to whether he might be leaving evidence to connect him with the crime?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always loved this movie and the first time I saw it was within a year after JFK was assassinated. I wonder these days if the Army DIA assisted or consulted with the movie.Did the director get all his input from the book?Did the author consult? The post Korean War era was sprinkled with stories of Brainwashing of US POW's captured during the Korean War. Generally speaking POW's captured during WWII were interrogated ,sometimes very brutally. The other intriguing parallel is that this movie was due to be released in the Fall of'63 but was delayed for several months after the JFK assassination. I don't believe there was a connection to this movies theme but the Oswald role in the JFK killing and this storyline are more than interesting??

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile, Despite Flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A disquieting plot and convincing performances (by most characters) elevate "The Manchurian Candidate" to classic status; however, much like a Hitchcock film, when put to the credibility test, it leaves the viewer scratching his head. For example, the idea of bashing a patrol of soldiers on their heads with rifle butts, rendering them unconscious but somehow unharmed, can only happen in Hollywood. And just ignore the Sinatra/Leigh affair because nobody (including the writer, most likely) understands it. It exists because, well, because, if it didn't, it wouldn't exist. Case closed. Then what about the drop-dead gorgeous Josie character instantly falling in love with the insecure, troubled, and tongue-tied Raymond? Happens all the time, right?But forget those warts because the movie actually works in spades (diamonds?): the fight scene; Raymond's heart-wrenching assassination of Senator Jordan and his beloved, Josie; Raymond jumping in the lake; the political manipulation; (Heinz) 57 communists in the government; and the tragic finale. The Cold War defined the '50s and '60s, and to appreciate this film, the viewer need only allow that premise to enjoy "The Manuchurian Candidate."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies that no matter how many times I have seen it, I can always watch it again.The ideas that make this 1962 film so intriguing were in Richard Condon's book published in 1959. The director, John Frankenheimer and the filmmakers, left some of it out, and changed the ending a little, but for the most part followed it quite closely. They came up with a movie that still has a modern edge, helped considerably by David Amram's punchy, jazz infused orchestral score.A platoon of U.S. soldiers commanded by Captain Marco (Frank Sinatra) is captured in Korea then brainwashed before being returned to America. One of them, Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), is planted as a sleeper to eventually assassinate key political figures. At first glance, it all seemed pretty far-fetched until real events in 1963 blurred the line between fact and fiction.Bizarrely, in his description of the relationship between Raymond Shaw's mother and his McCarthyesque stepfather, Condon has been accused of plagiarising Robert Graves' novel, "I Claudius". Although there is possibly something to it, knowing this doesn't detract from the brilliance of the plot.The novel and then the movie seemed quite prescient considering that they both came out before the assassination of JFK in Dallas in 1963. One of the conspiracy theories, which claimed that Lee Harvey Oswald had been programmed to kill, seemed eerily like "The Manchurian Candidate".Although these days, not so many Occidentals would be made up to look like Orientals, the main casting was interesting. Frank Sinatra might have been a touch old to play the officer in charge of the platoon, but he brought a big presence to the movie. Laurence Harvey, who hardly altered his English accent, brought class and a certain aloofness that was perfect for the role of Raymond Shaw.Harvey has always copped a lot of flack from critics and actors, especially from British film and theatre; they felt that he was a poor actor. Nevertheless, the public and Hollywood producers seemed to disagree because he cropped up in a lot of good movies around this time. While certain critics claim that this film was the one and only classic film in which he appeared, they also state that he was not the reason for its success. But surely the opposite is true, his intensity and that sense of the troubled outsider are a big part of the reason why it stays in the memory.Although the love interest between Sinatra and Janet Leigh's characters seemed a bit stilted, John Frankenheimer's direction was inspired; there are a number of great scenes in the film. But in the end, history meshed "The Manchurian Candidate" with unforgettable events, marking it as a film for the ages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tall-tale stands the test of time as the go-to pick of its genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Speaking of THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE, contemporary audience may still recall the 2004 remake headlined by Denzel Washington and Meryl Streep, directed by Jonathan Demme (a 6/10), which is a proficient political thriller and grafts the time-line from Korean War to Gulf War. Now it is time to revisit the original version directed by John Frankenheimer, the only film I have watched among his prolific filmography before this one actually is his final big screen feature, the romance-thriller mixed-bag REINDEER GAMES (2000, 5/10), Frankenheimer passed away in 2002, and this 1962 black-and-white stunner is no doubt above a few notches over its comparatively problematic remake, substantially due to the Harvey-Lansbury pair's Oscar-worthy performances.This outlandish brainwashing plot can be gauged as a fantasised product of the heightened McCarthyism conjoined with the widespread paranoia towards Communism at that particular era in the USA, based on Richard Cordon's 1959 novel of the same name, the conspiracy is undeniably ahead of its time, even now in 2015, half a century later, it still looks rather preposterous to believe in the first place, and all its technical explanations have been dumbed down to the hypnosis provoked by the sheer appearance of the "Queen of Diamonds" card and becomes an unwitting assassin, also our victim Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Harvey) is not literary "unwitting" to his merciless deeds, as it turns out, induced by Major Bennett Marco's (Sinatra) deck trick, afterwards, he is able to memorise what he has done in the hypnotic mode. Don't know what is the accurate medical term for his condition, in fact, Raymond resembles a man tormented by his uncontrollable transformation into another personality who is nothing but a killing machine, a multi-personae case maybe, but how on earth, North Korean scientists can pull off such a potent technique? The film never care to expound on that and Raymond's wake-up call is also a moot point without any definitive clarification about the theory of Bennett counteracting the effect with his cards trickery. But thankfully, all these puzzles do not shackle the film's engrossing vibrancy, Frankenheimer is such an imposing conductor at the helm of a layered conspiracy, stresses soldiers' PTSD quandary, juggles with the buffoonery of the so-called "diplomatic" political system, unblinkingly stages the abysmal tragedy we all fear to happen and its impactful ramifications on Raymond's mental breakdown, and last but not the least, lures viewers into the love-and-hatred manipulation executed by Raymond's scheming mother Mrs. Eleanor (Lansbury) with an incestuous allegation between them. Angela Lansbury is righteously honoured with an Oscar nomination for her starry vehemence as the super-villainess steers a vicious political campaign and is unscrupulous in her endeavour to achieve what she wants even if it has turned her beloved son into damaged goods, Lansbury is a magnificent attention grabber in her slightly elderly make-up and conveys the pernicious verve of a woman much older than her real age since in reality she is only three years senior than Harvey. Frank Sinatra is quite compelling in his saviour's character design, bestows audience with a pretty vintage fighting sequences with Henry Silva, who plays the Korean Chunjin, regrettably the casting director didn't have the gut to hire a real Asian to play him. In spite of her third-billing, Janet Leigh's entire presence is brief and unhooked to the major plot, the part where she gets instantly moonstruck by Sinatra's Bennett is so bogus to swallow, a red herring or not, her character is plain nonsensical. Laurence Harvey is the unsung hero in this picture, upstages Sinatra with his "I'm unlovable" monologue and his polarised personae are contagiously affecting out of his usual handsome dispassionateness. He is rapt with his sweetheart Jocelyn (Parrish) and her father Senator Thomas Jordan (McGiver), and utterly standoffish with his mother and even with Bennett, his tragedy looms large inevitably in the end, while the last-second turn of event is pretty much anticipated, his twist of fate still gives a lump in the throat. To a large extent, the film is a tall-tale engineered with the uppermost flourish with cinematic stunts and camera gimmicks, stands the test of time as the go-to pick of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Brainwashing is a goofy premise for a movie, but The Manchurian Candidate is so good, alternately dark and funny, that it's forgivable. The film walks a fine line between silly and serious. The villains, an empty- headed McCarthy-like senator and his conniving wife, are caricatures, far too exaggerated to work as satire, but Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey's performances as damaged ex-soldiers are played perfectly straight and with deep respect for the subject matter. This is a creative and sometimes heartbreaking thriller, if not a particularly thought-provoking one. Character actor John McGiver, recognizable from bit roles in movies like Breakfast at Tiffany's and Midnight Cowboy, excels as an affable patrician senator.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without its glitches but a brilliant writing with a complexity that is not seen in its era</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one can digest the silliness of its brainwashing concept and the trigger mechanism, it can easily turn out to be an excellent viewing experience. I did not quite get it in the first few seconds of the demonstration sequence, not because I could not follow a complex editing or screenplay but I just did not see it coming in a movie of that era. This is one of the most elaborate and beautifully written scripts I have ever come across.Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and his team were termed heroes and showered with medals and awards when they fight their way back home through a deep enemy territory during the Korean war. Shaw's mother Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin (Angela Lansbury) is a manipulative power broker now married to Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory) with a full intent to put him on the pedestal. Major Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) a member of Shaw's team and few others starts to have nightmares that contradict their daring escape story all pointing to something skeptical about Shaw. When Marco begins to lose his mind over this, he starts an unofficial inquiry until he finds something solid.The writing, editing, screenplay and performances were top notch for its time with a lot of emphasis on character development. But the narrative style did put me off sometimes especially Sinatra's piece. The girlfriend/wife character is out of the blue and does not serve any purpose than for him to go on narrating instead of having a conversation. Though it was brilliant for the writing to show the handlers do a lot of mock tests on their brainwash project before a real approach, the whole thing somehow looks messy and too fictional. The movie could've been easily been 20 minutes lesser in its runtime and action sequences were too dated. I can only speculate what a chilling resonance it could have had after JFK's assassination only a year later.Not without its glitches but a brilliant writing with a complexity that is not seen in its era</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie overall. One glaring flaw; the scene in which Raymond kills the senator and his wife with a silencer on a revolver is ridiculous. Anyone who knows anything about weapons knows that a silencer will NOT work on a revolver, only semi-automatic weapons. Silencer on revolver will do no good in that the noise is released due to revolver design. This I believe is the first time I've seen this really bad mistake in a movie of this importance. This is the second time I have submitted this fact and it as yet has not made it to publication. I hope this glaring discrepancy is corrected this time and it will not be necessary to repeat this.

		<shortDescription>A classic deserving of its reputation.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent political thriller that provides a troubling insight into a number of its characters with some Freudian touches. In keeping with its themes of brainwashing, the psychologies of some characters and the events that shaped them are examined, showing the effects of both their natural programming, and the artificial programming inflicted on them in the plot.For a film of its era, it has a relatively smart attitude towards the cold war and McCarthyism, though there is a tendency to characterise the communists as nefarious plotters, and the US as an absolute of its ideals. Though most of the American characters are upstanding and unflinchingly good, this is not uncommon for the time and they are at least fairly well characterised, with depth in their motivations and perceptions of life.The acting is powerful for the most part, with good direction and cinematography. As other reviews have noted, the film is interesting throughout and rarely loses steam.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Adaptation of Condon's Novel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of Frank Sinatra's best efforts, in which he does not play the Chairman of the Board but a neurotic Army major who needs desperately to discover why he's having such terrifying dreams.He finds out that he and the half dozen other members of his unit were captured and brainwashed in Manchuria during the Korean War. The object of the brainwashing was to have a Medal of Honor awarded to Lawrence Harvey, a sergeant, for saving all but two members of the detail.Harvey was not only brainwashed but "dry cleaned." Without knowing it, Harvey has been programmed to obey any command he's been given by communist agents in New York. Mainly, these involve murders and are designed to culminate in the assassination of a newly elected anti-communist president, which will then hand the reins of the nation over to Harvey's stupid blowhard of a step father -- or rather to Harvey's incestuous mother, Angela Lansbury, who is in charge of the entire enterprise.It may sound more complicated in this abstract than it is on screen. You're not likely to be confused.Condon's novel was a triumph of irony and at times extremely funny, if a little sloppily written. The movie isn't sloppy at all. It condenses the story just enough, so that we're never lost. And it captures some of the more amusing of Condon's scenes. Sinatra's nightmare, for instance. He and his squad are stuck in a New Jersey hotel having to listen to the meeting of a lady's garden club. The speaker, and all the club members, are high ranking communists from China, North Korea, and Russia, but in Sinatra's dream they're all well-dressed elderly suburban ladies talking about hydrangea. We see the nightmare of another member of the patrol, the African-American James Woods, now a civilian in Alaska. The dream is identical except all the members of the Lady's Garden Club are black.There isn't space enough to detail all the virtues of this film, which would include the melodic dissonance of David Amram's musical score. But I have to mention three stand-out performances. Sinatra has never been better than he is here. One doesn't think of FRANK SINATRA as capable of projecting despair but the scene in which he suffers an anxiety attack on a train, drops his cigarette into his drink, and has an elliptical conversation with Janet Leigh is classic, packed with the non sequiturs that Richard Condon was so fond of.James Gregory is Harvey's step father, a U. S. Senator, and here he enacts the kind of role for which he's singularly suited: the blowhard, braggart, drunken, cowardly self promoter whose pupils are always "pinned at f11" from all the drugs his wife is pumping into him. The role goes back to the comedies of Ancient Rome, the Miles Gloriosus. Bue Gregory was born to play it, as Thelma Ritter was born to play tough, plain-spoken maids. His character here has the rough edges smoothed off for the censors. In the book he was at an Army weather station in Greenland, starved for sex. "It's not a question of poon-tang next year or poon-tang next week; it's a question of poon-tang NOW!" He trudges miles across the frozen wasteland to get at an Eskimo girl and crawls back, hallucinating, screaming about foot odor. "The feet! Oh, my God, those FEET!" Of his evil wife, Lansbury, it can be said there were few better actresses of her generation. She's splendid here in a very dramatic and complex role, as she was exceptional in a black comedy like "The Demon Barber of Fleet Street" on Broadway. Gregory is so spaced that he keeps confusing the number of card-carrying communists in the Senate, so Lansbury pins it down to an easy-to-remember 57, since Gregory is fond of Heinz ketchup, made in "57 different varieties."I won't go on about this. It ends tragically but it's impossible not to be gripped by the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Political paranoia is more fashionable now than it was when Kennedy was still in the Oval Office, so it shouldn't be surprising that John Frankenheimer's Cold War thriller, seen today, is like breath of fresh air. The film's pessimistic view of American politics and unexpected satire of the presidential campaign trail were years ahead of their time, and the baroque styling (stark lighting, oblique camera angles) still makes it look ridiculously modern. The plot is little more than pulp fiction, made legitimate by some far reaching implications about political manipulation and the self-destructive danger of unchecked ideology. And the strange cast of characters (including a brainwashed Korean War veteran transformed into the perfect assassin, his ruthless, ambitious mother, and her right-wing nincompoop candidate husband) keeps it always unpredictable, which of course is the aim of any true thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointedly Unites Right-Wing Demagogues With Their Perceived Left-Wing Enemies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer absorbs us and exercises our minds by simultaneously showing multiple perspectives of the same dream and the real-life effects of it. It is a mystery where the process of deduction comes not initially from physical proof but from decoding and analyzing a dream. This dream is at the heart of the movie, a redefining political thriller responding in a moody and sensory way to the Cold War paranoia of its time. Its problem is that it also responds with pat plot tunes such as the needless romantic interest in the form of a rather wasted Janet Leigh.At the film's roots is a premise suggesting the brainwashing effects of political ideology: The soldiers have Pavlovian responses for opinions and they struggle against the dissonance they sense that they have with them. Indeed, the pivotal character is an assassin, an unwitting assassin, who blindly executes his deed at the sight of a playing card, an inanimate face to whom he endows all command of his conscious mind. The focus of the story is not political conflict but the deepest cognitive turmoil of those involved in political conflict. That is what is scary about politics, that it controls our points of view and our feelings. And if the only truth we can sense in our buried feelings, what proof do we have that anything is wrong? There is a bombastic right-wing political figure much in the tradition of Joe McCarthy, and yet is he the driving force behind all of his actions? No; it is his wife. His wife looks like any other affluent American family woman of the 1950s and '60s, but there is something about her, an effect she has on those closest to her, her husband and her son, where whether they like it or not, they find themselves doing her bidding. And even still, their relationship goes so much deeper than that.Sinatra was an extraordinary actor. When he, Major Marco, is having the same reoccurring nightmare, we don't just see a sleeping man jerking around and scrunching his eyebrows saying, "N-no, no?" He gives us a candid-feeling rendering of a guy dozing off, eyes open, shut, open, and the words he says in his sleep have less to do with the dream but how his subconscious would feel about it.There is such gravitas in this deeply paranoid story that to have any characters extraneous as that of Janet Leigh's, and to have her played by a name actress, a very talented one, is to diffuse the resonance of the subtext. When the dejected Captain Marco, played so persuasively by Frank Sinatra, happens upon her on a train, she approaches him in spite of all his apparent reluctance to be social, and trades contact information. It could be read as an exchange of signals of some sort, that there is something about her identity buried beneath the unassuming surface of a charmed-at-first-sight encounter. Is she working for the Communists? Considering the nature of the story's diabolical Communist plot, there is truly nowhere to run or hide from their operatives and their influence. Alas, however, this is never followed through, and she is reduced to not only a romantic foil for the leading man but a piece of scenery.Nevertheless, The Manchurian Candidate is a haunting and unique film. There are moments in the earlier half of the film that feel like black comedy, mostly owing to the nature of such passive men, who've been hypnotized into believing they are at a tea party, committing ruthlessly violent acts by the orders of who they see as caricatured old ladies, as if to have just been told to fetch more napkins. And yet this dark humor germinates into horrific tragedy. As a matter of fact, the film ends on one of the saddest notes of any film of its kind. Just as it pointedly unites right-wing politicians with their perceived left-wing enemies, the movie unites tone in a way only Frankenheimer seemed to be doing at the time. The film broods, chuckles and creates an equal parallel third of tension, as in what was the first karate fight in an American film, or the climactic scene which, at the same time it seems baffling, it also feels inevitable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is like opening up a long forgotten time capsule. It's a little bit of an embarrassment to realize it is so dated but still enjoyable. While Frank Sinatra as Marco makes far too many mistakes as an intelligence officer: telling details of the case to Eugenie (Janet Leigh), letting Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) and Jocelyn Jordon (Leslie Parrish) go on their honeymoon, letting Shaw leave for his assignment without a tail, he still has the distinction of taking part in the first chop socky fight in a Hollywood movie, unless you consider the ass whooping that Spencer Tracy gave to Ernest Borgine in Bad Day at Black Rock. Also, you have to laugh out loud at the dialogue between Marco and Eugenie on the train ride.But it is all worth it to watch Angela Lansbury and James Gregory in their roles as the Washington power couple. Gregory is perfect as bully senator and buffoon husband. Lansbury is dead on as the ultra manipulative bitch, ready to sacrifice friends and foes with equal dispatch.The blurring of sides must have shocked early 1960's audiences and the films disappearance from the movie world following the Kennedy assassination clearly added to the mystique and confusion. We live in a far more jaded time and expect twists and turns and betrayals in every political movie we see. But in its day, the film packed a heady punch.Still, every time I come across the movie on TV, I will dial in, just to see the flipped out dream scene with Khigh Dheigh and the Russian and Chinese running dogs. Too far out: a brain washing garden party with an evil Chinese mastermind who laughs at the absurdity in every situation. They don't make 'em like that any more. Except maybe for Austin Powers. Or In Like Flynt. Or Casino Royale. But wait, those are comedies and this is a political thriller.OK - so dated political thrillers become funny. I can watch that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solitaire's the only game in town</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer's `The Manchurian Candidate', like the remake three decades later, is very much a reflection of its time. It was made in 1962 and is set in 1952. When watching the film, it helps to remember the political environment. McCarthyism, the House Un-American Activities Committee, red-baiting and blacklisting characterized the 1950s. The Cold War and the Cuban missile crisis marked the early 1960s. The uses and misuses of psychiatry-and its modern cousin, brainwashing-also fascinated the era. Both could tamper with or unlock the human psyche.The liberal-conservative clash of Senators John Iselin (James Gregory) and Thomas Jordan (John McGiver) is typical of the period. Iselin is but a thinly veiled portrayal of Senator Joe McCarthy himself. There is also a dash of then Vice President Richard Nixon. (Think of Alger Hiss.) Oddly, Iselin and Jordan come across as clownish and buffoonish. They are not to be taken altogether seriously.Then come Dr. Yen Lo (Khigh Dheigh), the Pavlov Institute, and the panoply of Chinese and Russian military brass. They are the other side of the coin. Of course, they are played strictly for laughs. (Yen Lo, in particular, has a wry sense of humor.) Far be it from an American director of the early 1960s to credit the enemy with any real intelligence.Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) and Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) are far more interesting. They are complex and thus real characters. Sinatra is remarkably good and controlled in his performance. Harvey is more weepy and maudlin as the tragic, tortured victim of brainwashing and political intrigue. But he transcends the limitations of his role and is eminently watchable.Janet Leigh's role as Eugenie Rose Chaney is somewhat enigmatic. One senses that she is more than a love interest for Ben Marco. Eugenie strangely insists that Ben memorize her address and phone number when they have only just met. (The 2004 remake beefs up Eugenie's character and she becomes a federal agent. That makes a lot of sense in light of the 1962 film.)But the icy core of the film is Mrs. Iselin (Angela Lansbury). Remember that kindly old busybody, Jessica Fletcher, from `Murder, She Wrote'? And the even kindlier Mrs. Potts from `Beauty and the Beast'? Who'd have thought she could be such a cold-blooded, hard-as-nails, cast-iron bitch? In the 1950s, Mamie Eisenhower was First Lady. Women were relegated to being trophy wives. For a film set in that period, Mrs. Iselin's Lady Macbeth is truly unique.Raymond Shaw's brainwashing is triggered by the phrase, `Why don't you pass the time by playing a game of solitaire?' Take my advice. Watch `The Manchurian Candidate' instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great movie, but in an odd way. Three quarters of the movie are exposition and a building to climax, with some ridiculous dialogue and saccharine, contrived plots. But the last quarter of the movie is inspired; it's the most cinematic ally perfect portion of a movie I've ever seen. In the last 45 minutes, loose and fatty themes crystallize: Shaw, dressed as a priest, assassinates his stepfather in a bizarre sacrifice on a political altar. Frankenhiemer makes his Shaw a "holy" assassin-- the stepfather becomes an unwitting Lincoln who gives his life for America. Look farther than the "political thriller"--the movie has the scattered apparatus of an anatomy of sacrifice.If an hour and a half is only a scaffold for the tremendous conclusion of the film, it is an hour and a half very well spent. "Manchurian Candidate" lacks the coherency to be a masterpiece; but open yourself to it like you'd open yourself in an art museum. The genius and the mediocre hang side by side.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Thriller/Satire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic is one of the best films ever in two genres-thriller and satire. It is also the movie where Frank Sinatra gives his finest performance as an actor.As a thriller, the movie keeps you interested by watching Sinatra's character try to hold it together as he begins to piece the conspiracy together. His fight scene with the always dependable Henry Silva is on the earliest displays of martial arts fighting in modern cinema.As a satire, the movie savagely spoofs the insanity and lunacy of the McCarthy era, when just an accusation of communism could create panic and sensation. The 2004 remake, even with Denzel Washington and meryl Streep, has its work cut out for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a film that defines "layercake". The connections between characters, plot, and visualization is complex yet interesting. Seeing as it's an election year, I figure now is the best time for this review.This is your only spoiler warning...Everything here is fake. Consider:--Harvey and Sinatra aren't living as themselves, they aren't natural. They're artificial humans.--The facades from the hospital to the Iselins. Even with Harvey as a war hero.--Leigh's dialog is totally unreal. Fake speech.--Even death is misinterpreted: fake.Then there is the hallucination, a rare example of Frankenheimer's mastery. The solitaire game is another little touch that works, Harvey's mind against itself.Alas, this is a superficially interesting piece. Too many other plot elements--namely the victim of Iselin's banter--don't work. Spoiled ingredients in the cake.One of a few Frankenheimer works that don't age like Hitchcock.Final Analysis = = Midrange Material</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding direction for a flawed script</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Too many inconsistencies and a totally forced sub-plot (Ben's love story, totally irrelevant) kinda ruined this movie for me. I mean I enjoyed it, but I just coudln't take it seriously, and some situations just don't make sense at all, I was wondering what the writers were thinking of when conceiving some scenes!It seems like this script has been tampered with many times, by people whose views on the final product were quite different. The result is very, very uneven.The basic idea is still excellent, even if it's a straight "good (america) VS evil (ussr)" plot. But it's a paranoiac story, and I tend to love paranoiac stories (no surprise that "Brazil" is among my all-times favorites).I really admired the way Frankenheimer has been able to brilliantly bring life to this mediocre script, and even create some stunning scenes that are among the most jubilating ones in cinema history. He really made the best possible film out of the material he had to work with, and obviously saved the project, because without his talent I think "The manchurian candidate" would have resembled a full-featured version of an "Avengers" episode... Oh I do like the Avengers (Ms. Peele rules! :-)), but I don't expect to take it seriously...I think that despite its shallow substance, it's a movie that I'll have pleasure to view again in the future.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**** A LITTLE BIT OF SPOILER ****I absolutely love the movie, and overall it blew me away... but... somehow I fell asleep everytime when Janet Leigh's scenes came up?! Also 3 things I just didn't get it?! 1.What was Janet Leigh doing in the film? Her conversation with Frank Sinatra sounded as though they both work for some sort of secret agents and theytalked in codes ("are you Arabian" was asked at least 3 times)? Listen carefully to their dialogues... didn't make sense at all and I was misled to assuming her as an important character! 2.Leslie Parrish taking off the white blouse revealing a "strapless" bra !!!... Don't tell me it was a necessary gesture to complete a political theme Hollywood movie!? Cheezie! 3.Janet Leigh's relationship with Frank Sinatra... Still didn't make sense to me after watching this movie 3 times repeatedly within one day.However, this film really shocked me as I did not realize how politicallyexpressive a film could go in such a chaotic and unstable America in the 60's. Really wish to see a remake of this film!!! 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE (1962) **** Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Janet Leigh, Angela Lansbury, James Gregory, Henry Silva.Leslie Parrish. John Frankenheimer's masterpiece adaptation of Richard Condon's novel about brainwashed mama's boy Harvey (snooty and pathetic at the same time), a Korean War 'hero' who becomes the unwitting pawn between his harridan mother (cast against type Lansbury, ruthlessly chilling) and a Communist plot to assassinate a presidential candidate proved years ahead of its time and tragically of its time; the film was released after John F. Kennedy's assassination and was too painful for Sinatra, a long-time friend of the slain president, who stopped its short run. Powerfully gripping and shot in beautiful black and white; you'll never look at Solitaire the same again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brings A Lot Of Dedication From The Performers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" created such a major impact at the time that it was was unfortunately shelved from further release after the tragic assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy in Dallas, Texas on November 22, 1963. This film was a high-impact very disturbing political thriller that turned in wonderful performances from Old Blue Eyes, Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, Lawrence Harvey and Janet Leigh. Directed by the legendary John Frankenheimer, the screenplay based on Richard Condon's classic novel, "Winter Kills" demonstrates how media frenzy and one person's political aspects could cause a devastating turnaround seen through the behavior of one man's political beliefs. Sinatra's role as Korean War veteran Maj. Bennett Marco as a man who's completely dedicated by his position as a prisoner of war during those three years in hell, is truly a an honorably complex role as man who's after a Staff Sargent who could strike at any moment. Marco is motivated by the traumatic nightmares he's encountered with during the three year war and releasing his conscience in order to unravel the mystery and to question a brainwashed platoon member of the Korean War soldiers that was under this lunatic's command.Sinatra is accompanied by plethora of very talented performers, especially Lawrence Harvey as the titular character, the former drill Sargent Raymond Shaw, who was raised in an upper class American family who is now fanatical about the Korean War, someone who is manipulated into becoming an enraged lunatic at any second, one brainwashing code words are implanted into his head. His over-controlling mother played by Angela Lansbury is played to perfection, while James Gregory who play's her husband who's a McCarthy influenced Senator is working his way to progression to have a seat in the Oval Office.Through further questioning with other POW's, Marco starts to have doubts about his own memories, which feels superficial and somewhat untrue, but through his hallucinations at night, he starts to progressively get closer to the whole truth. The plot really starts to piece together as the conclusion is unraveled with a surprising finale that will shock everyone. The choreography and the cinematography is elegant and brilliantly done with the type flair that Frankenheimer was famous for. as it's well patterned from the twists and turns that were uncovered by Marco. This was a brilliant thriller that will shock you, keep your mid guessing and very real characters. Plus the mystery element will always be the ultimate riddle that should both entertain you as well as keep you guessing in the film's entirety.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ambassador of Fear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With 'The Manchurian Candidate' director Frankenheimer backs up his status as the master of the political thriller and delivered a cinematic masterpiece with subversively explosive power.Lt. Raymond Shaw (Harvey) is not a person you would like. Actually the Vietnam veteran and son of the conservative Senator John Iselin (Gregory) should be in bad memory for his fellow war comrads as a sulky, self-opinionated character. That's why it seems quite odd that they praise Shaw after they have returned home. Did he planted the units out of adverse territories in a solo run? Captain Bennett Marco (Sinatra) starts to doubt the exploit. In his nightmares he sees that the troops were kidnapped and brainwashed by the enemy, while war hero Shaw killed two of his own men under hypnosis. Soon, Marco finds out that Shaw is converted into a will-less, deadly instrument without knowing of the actions of his alter ego.The fact that the film disappeared in the sinkings after its release for years and years, speaks an obvious language. Too painful have been the murders of the Kennedy brothers, Luther King Jr., Malcolm X; too pinching have been the depressing prophecies of The Manchurian Candidate, its dispute over the matter of political assassination.It is a grim, daunting film which imparts an irritating coerciveness of its happening on the screen with perfectly arranged and meticulously constructed black and white shots. The architecture of the images seems to be precisely sophisticated: In one scene, Frankenheimer puts a monitor in the foreground to cross various perspectives which are mutually commenting, contradicting and completing - as if the events on the screen are following a secret dramaturgy, only visible for the viewer. The protagonists have to poise in grillingly incertitude. Anyway, cameras and monitors seem to be everywhere. Even the most private things - like Shaws incestuous love-hate relationship to his evil mother (Lansbury with her greatest performance of her career) - appears to become an affair with public significance. In a threatened world you can be with your nation or against it - the problem is, you never know who is on which side.With its imagery full of symbolic references - like the playing cards that even adopt human shape towards the end - the film unfolds an iconographic program with a thoroughly fatalistic message: The viewer is asked to perceive analogies (i.e. between the painting of President Lincoln which gets into the shape of the drunken Senator). Every human being, as Frankenheimer seems to assume, is not more than a will-less playing card, his political leaders not more than externally controlled decals of ideologies without making any sense. Considering that the film was made in 1962, it still and undoubtedly holds an explosive issue for today's controversial political world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Maybe McCarthy wasn't so off-base.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a chilling story about how the national security of the United States is compromised. The story includes several memorable characters: Sergeant Raymond Shaw, Major Bennett Marco, Senator John Yerkes Iselin, Senator Thomas Jordan, and Jocelyn Jordan. However, one character dominates the story: Senator Iselin's wife, Mrs. Eleanor Shaw Iselin, played with exceeding effectiveness by Angela Lansbury. Mrs. Iselin is one of the most detestable characters in the history of Hollywood cinema. She is a cold-blooded manipulator and murderer. Sam Spade and Mike Hammer would have had no chance against her. She is too ruthless. She is a Fifth-columnist, a Quisling, and a Benedict Arnold all wrapped up into one, but worse because she is essentially apolitical, which makes her actions seem even more irrational. She is not preaching the party line. She believes in one thing only: Mrs. Iselin. She will stop at nothing to achieve her aim, which is absolute power. She is a megalomaniac. There is nothing too low that she won't do to achieve her goal, which includes committing incest with her hapless and troubled son, Sergeant Shaw, whose surly yet pliable nature fits perfectly into her sordid and nefarious plan. Mrs. Iselin is even more sinister in the way she wraps herself in the mantel of patriotism to disguise her wicked scheme. Who could ever suspect that such a patriotic flag-waving American, married to a loud, brash, commie-baiting US senator, would be plotting her country's downfall? Only one person knows: Sergeant Shaw. But is Mrs. Iselin really in control of her actions? As the movie depicts, victims of brain washing are not even aware that they are being controlled. Indeed, it is unclear whether Mrs. Iselin herself is acting on cue from her handlers, or is she taking the initiative and using her handlers for "technical support" instead. Is she the master operative or the tool? The idea that outside forces hostile to the United States could plant operatives inside highest levels of power gives cause for concern, because it could happen. Such concern is as relevant today as it was during the Cold War, which is why, in the post 9-11 world, this movie, although released in 1962, would resonate with today's audience. Is this movie film noir? It has the trappings of film noir ? the black and white photography, the dysfunctional characters, the violence, the odd camera angles ? yet deals with such a wide range of sub-textual themes ? political, international, social, societal, familial, military, and psychological ? and tells a story set in locations so far-flung ? from Korea to Washington, DC to New York City, that it may not fit in the film noir genre. This movie is not a crime drama. There is no detective getting caught up in a quest for a McGuffin and the bad guys are not street hoodlums, but rather Soviet operatives using a radical method of behavioral conditioning to infiltrate and subvert the government of the United States. This makes the movie either a political drama or a war movie depicting a new and insidious kind of psychological warfare based on mind control.This movie makes you think about how our government can be insidiously infiltrated and subverted by outside elements that want to destroy us and and do so in a manner that is so cunning and devious that we won't even know that it's happening. It also makes you think about how a highly suggestible and vulnerable individual can become an unwitting shill for those outside elements who are plotting to overthrow the government. The plot seems fantastically improbable, but it isn't. When a man can be conditioned to respond to a certain cue, and then do the most improbable and outrageous acts, like jumping into a lake or assassinating someone, then there's a definite problem, as portrayed in this movie. Laurence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, Angela Lansbury, James Gregory and the rest of the cast are excellent in this real Cold War thriller. Indeed, this movie causes one to re-examine the entire McCarthy era. Senator McCarthy may have been right in his warning about the infiltration of Communist subversives into the U. S. government; he was just accusing the wrong people of being the subversives. This is a movie to take seriously because it's credible ... maybe too credible. By the way, if you are a fan of hypnotism or are attracted to the Queen of Hearts then this movie is definitely for you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is even classier than an Alfred Hitchcock presentation. Intelligent, gripping, taut, and very convincingly portrayed. I wish more actors of today understood the fine line between good acting and overacting. Every character in this movie is balanced, measured, and entirely believable. That, for me, is the best thing about this movie.The plot is novel, and sustaining. True, if you take it apart under the magnifying glass, you may find discrepancies in a few places, but that by itself is quite insignificant, given the movie's other merits. There is enough suspense, storyline, drama, and great acting to make this one of cinema's all time greats.I have deliberately not reviewed the storyline here, for the benefit of those who have not watched it. A truly good movie like this should not give anything away. Just an encouragement to the hesitant, that this is not a movie you will regret watching. If you are a lover of classic, intelligent cinema, of course. Maybe even if you aren't, come to think of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Lives Up To Its Reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Legend has it that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was withdraw from distribution in the wake of the Kennedy assassination. This is not true. 1962 reviews ranged from lackluster to savage, with Laurence Harvey's performance the focus of critical ire; box office was tepid; and in the end the film vanished from screens of its own accord.Legend also has it that THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE was not seen again until 1988. This is not true. The film was broadcast on television on at least three occasions between 1965 and 1975--but although critical response was more positive, audience interest remained low. What is true, however, is that star Frank Sinatra, who controlled the rights, had become extremely disenchanted with distributor United Artists, and by 1975 he was no longer willing to allow the film to be shown under their banner.Like some films that are briefly seen and then hidden from public view, the longer THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE remained off the screen the more it came to be considered an important film, a classic film. When Sinatra and United Artists resolved their dispute in 1988, THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE went into a limited theatrical release, and on this occasion it did not disappoint: it received a critical reevaluation that was overwhelmingly positive.Seen today, it is virtually impossible to watch the film without the ghosts of John F. Kennedy and Lee Harvey Oswald haunting the screen. Consequently, it is very difficult to evaluate the film in a purely critical sense. The story concerns Sgt. Raymond Shaw, stepson of Senator Iselin (James Gregory), who returns from the Korean War with a Medal of Honor. But something odd occurs: the men that served with him, including Major Marco (Frank Sinatra), begin to have nightmares about Shaw and about what really happened in Korea. It soon transpires that Shaw, and to a certain extent his entire company, were captured and "brainwashed"--and Shaw has been turned into an unwitting assassin.The 1959 Richard Condon novel was as much a wickedly funny satire on American politics as it was a suspense thriller, and screenwriter George Axelrod keeps that quality intact. The film is very witty in an extremely perverse way, and while director Frankeheimer has been praised for his cinematic technique, his real triumph here is the way he balances this darkly comic edge with the film's plot: instead of balancing them, he allows them to grate against each other. You are never quite sure how you are supposed to take the film from scene to scene, and the result is a mounting sense of unease.In terms of the cast, Angela Lansbury's performance as Shaw's mother Mrs. Iselin is justly famous, and it will come as great shock to those who tend to think of her in terms of her television work. She is easily one of the most evil characters ever put on screen, a horrifying combination of stridency, ruthlessness, ambition, and Freudian nightmare. But in truth the entire cast is extremely good, all the way from the star players to the bit parts.This is easily Frank Sinatra's best film performance, and although Laurence Harvey received poor reviews in 1962, it is today impossible to imagine any other way to play the role. Janet Leigh also scores in a small but smartly written role, as does James Gregory, whose role is clearly based on the notorious Senator Joe McCarthy. Also particularly memorable are John McGiver and Leslie Parrish as Senator Thomas Jordan and his daughter Jocelyn.The cinematography is remarkably stylish with too many memorable set pieces to count; seldom has Frankenheimer so effectively used his talent for creating a newsreel-like tone. The score, the editing, and the production values are also quite fine, and taken as a package the film has been tremendously influential; one can see it in the work of such directors as William Friedkin and Oliver Stone, particularly in the latter's controversial film JFK.But there is a flaw here. For all the expertise, the film becomes less engaging as it progresses. The film has a very detached tone and the major characters tend to be unsympathetic, and both Frankenheimer and Axelrod are just a shade too careful to spell out all the details. In the end, the deliberately uneasy mixture of comic and dramatic elements seem to play out just one step too far, and the film becomes just a shade too cool in tone for its own good. By the time the film ends you are having to work a bit too hard to stay with it. I'm giving the film five stars; it deserves that, and easily. And I think everyone who sees it will enjoy it--but I suspect that one viewing will be enough for most.THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE is presently available to the home market via VHS and DVD. The "Special Edition" DVD release is quite good, with crisp elements. It includes a commentary by director Frankenheimer and various interviews, including a short conversation between Sinatra, Frankenheimer, and Axelrod; an interview with Angela Lansbury; and a short comment by director William Friedkin.Gary F.

		<shortDescription>With Dick Cheney Starring as Angela Lansbury...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd never seen either version of The Manchurian Candidate. Until tonight. Throughout the movie, all I could think was:Angela Lansbury is really Dick Cheney (Mrs. Islen)James Gregory is really George W. Bush (Senator Islen)I hope I don't need to explain why!The 1962 edition is a surprisingly sophisticated movie. Other than To Kill a Mockingbird, I've always felt that most movies made before about 1967 were quite simple. But the original Manchurian Candidate is a movie fighting both McCarthyism ("I have before me a list of 254 Communists...") and Nixon (notice the fop-sweat when Harvey and Sinatra got nervous?). It's a surprisingly good movie, and I regret not having seen it before.It's probably too late, but I urge anyone planning to see the 2004 remake of The Manchurian Candidate to see the 1962 version first. Remember, this movie was shot about two years before Kennedy was assasinated, and only seven years after the McCarthy hearings were considered more dangerous than Communism itself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, yes, yes, I understand the coincidence and context of this film coming out before the JFK, RFK, MLK murders and the biting political humor... However I find this movie terribly overrated. I have to still recommend that you see it for the cultural relevance but don't expect a fast paced thrill ride because this one is a slow burn, with what in my opinion was a predictable ending. Don't however let that stop you. See this movie. Graphically interesting the film has a stylish look.The minor flaws of this movie really do an injustice to the biting nature of the political commentary. I felt some of the acting was truly dreadful with Laurence Harvey's accent switching from blueblood east coast to British depending on the scene. Annoying. Also, I understand it's a thriller and there are a lot of stressful situations but would people really sweat constantly? I suppose AC wasn't as widespread. I got the vibe that the set of this film must have smelled like someone's dirty gym locker. The amount of mustache twisting that went into the evil scientists plan was a caricature in itself and was I suppose, a symptom of the hysteria in that age. NO way would someone we are supposed to believe is a mastermind and is that intelligent would act like such a gloating jerk. At least don't expect me to take it seriously. I'm being a bit harsh and I realize a certain amount of disbelief suspension is needed but would the communists really underestimate their ring leader that much? I guess it's neither here nor there but at this point I could care less.After a friend pointed it out, Angela Lansbury did seem terribly like Ann Coulter in the way that she was an annoying, ruthless, power hungry doppelganger quick to chide the hired immigrant help as well as dominate the minds of weak willed men. I found the handling of her character heavy handed possibly due to the era this was written. I'm not even going to get into the fact that the author and filmmakers felt the need to make her incestuous to hammer home the point that she wasn't just a power hungry woman but pure evil (lest you confuse the two). Sign of the times? Credit where due however, she chews up the scenery in every exchange and the film is better off.Frank does inject some needed amount of masculinity into this film. The karate scene with the Korean operative however, made me laugh out loud. While the scene was laughable it did mark the point where the film starts to turn and pick up speed. The film gets more taught after the initial groundwork is laid and if the directors had found a better way to ratchet this up (it's called editing my boy) in the first 30-40 minutes I might have been even more into the rest of the film.Interesting to wrap your mind around but far too overrated. However, still a landmark and this is still a 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterpiece. One of the most extraordinary movies to ever come out of Hollywood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've watched 'The Manchurian Candidate' several times over the years and it never ceases to impress me. I just bought it on DVD, recently released here in Region 4 (no Frankenheimer commentary though - shame on you!), so of course I watched it again. For me it gets better and better with each viewing and more and more pertinent. Now I know some people glibly dismiss it because of the dated Cold War theme, but they miss the fundamental point that it doesn't matter whether it's the extreme Left or the extreme Right we're dealing with, the methods displayed in this movie are still timely, especially the use of the media to emotionally manipulate the public. 'The Manchurian Candidate' is still the best political thriller ever made in my opinion, but it's more than just that. It's a very complex movie yet incredibly easy to watch. Everything about it is very cool - the direction, editing, dialogue. And the cast are all first rate. Laurence Harvey is the perfect choice for Raymond Shaw, cold, unlikeable but still somehow sympathetic. I'm no fan of Sinatra as a singer, but he's an underrated actor. This is his best performance along with 'The Man With The Golden Arm'. Angela Lansbury is chilling and very believable as Shaw's ruthlessly ambitious mother. Janet Leigh's role is a bit slight, but I always enjoy watching her. 'Touch Of Evil', 'Psycho' and this, what a run of brilliant movies she had! I also got a kick out of seeing cult favourites Henry Silva ('Thirst', 'Chained Heat') playing a Korean(!), and the late Whit Bissell ('Invasion Of The Body Snatchers', 'Soylent Green') in supporting roles. I would really love to hear Frankenheimer's commentary on this, as it really is a fascinating movie. Frankenheimer had a long and uneven career, but in 'The Manchurian Candidate' and 'Seconds' he gave us two of the most extraordinary movies to ever come out of Hollywood. Both are masterpieces in my opinion, and neither gets the attention they deserve.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Boy, they don't make 'em like this anymore -- suspense and thrills that keep you on the edge of your seat for over 2 hours, without any gratuitous gore, violence, car chases or explosions. Just a unique, tense, engrossing story, well-acted.This movie must have had a chilling impact on the public in 1962, at the height of the Cold War, and it still packs a punch now. Lots of twists and turns that will surprise you and keep you guessing, right up to the final scene.And the cast: you've never seen or suspected Angela Lansbury could be so evil, and Sinatra is also convincing. Plus -- supporting players that provide lots of cross-show trivia:-- Khigh Dhieg, who plays the Chinese agent, played virtually the same part as recurring guest Chinese agent villain Wo-Fat in several Hawaii 5-0 episodes (including the pilot episode about brainwashing!). Talk about typecasting!-- James Gregory, who plays Sen. Iselin, plays the evil Dr. Adams on the original Star Trek series episode "Dagger of the Mind" -- again in an episode about brainwashing.-- Albert Paulsen, who plays a Russian agent, played several different villain roles also on Hawaii 5-0 and Mission Impossible.-- Reggie Nalder, who plays one of the Russian agents, also plays the assassin in the 1956 "Man Who Knew Too Much".This one is not to be missed -- 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** Towards the end of the movie "The Manchurian Candidate" Raymond Shaw, Laurence Harvey, puts the Congressional Medal of Honor, the highest honor that the United States can bestow to it's fighting men and women, around his neck. For the first time since he won it back in 1952 in the Korean War Raymond really felt that he earned it, and so did everyone else in the theater watching the movie.Raymond never really felt right with that medal and disliked having to wear it he felt that he didn't earn it and that everything about his war record was false. Saving nine fellow GI's from the Communist Chinese by whom they were held captive and also wiping out a North Korean and Communist Chinese patrol as the GI's under his leadership fought their way back across the border into South Korea was more then enough for Raymond to get the Medal of Honor but something deep inside his mind told him it was a lie. But this time there was nothing at all phony about what Raymond did. He saved the United States from a covert Communist takeover, but by doing that it cost Raymond his life.Powerful Cold War thriller that never lost it's punch since it's release back in 1962 with it's story about an attempt to overthrow and take over the United States government from within. Super American patriot and closet USSR &amp; Communist Chinese collaborator Mrs. Iselin, Angela Lansbury, is positioning her drunken and buffoonish husband, and her son Raymond's step-father, Sen. John "Johnny" Iselin, James Gregory, to become President of the United States. Mrs. Iselin first plans to get "Johnny" nominated Vice President and then have the president of the party out of office assassinated which will catapult "Johnny" into the White House due to the sympathetic and emotional volcano that would erupt all over the country following that tragic event. Secretly working with the Soviet Union for ten years Mrs. Iselin has used her position as Sen. Iselin's wife and head of some fifteen American Patriotic organizations where she is now within reach of her goals. But Mrs. Iselin has other ideas about what she'll do as the power behind her husband the future President Iselin when he takes office. Resenting both the Soviet Union and Communist China Mrs. Iselin didn't forget what they did in making her beloved and only son an instrument of murder to achieve their aims. And even worse treating her with disrespect and not as an equal she'll make sure that they won't forget that either. Mrs. Iselin maniacally plans to use the full force of the US military to destroy those two Communist powers, for what they did to Raymond and how they treated her, in a Third World War. The "Manchurian Candidate" starts out with a bad dream and ends with an awakened and walking nightmare with a double-assassination and suicide at the Presidential Nominating Convention at Madison Square Garden in New York City. Frank Sinatra, Maj. Bennett Marco, gives one of the best acting performances of his career as a troubled Korean War Vet. who's nightmares of what happened to him and his comrades as prisoners of the Communists Chinese in Manchuria becomes real, all too real.The one thing that Raymond Shaw ever wanted in his life is to be both loved and lovable. The most disliked man in his unit in Korea Raymonds former comrades-in-arms, including Maj. Marco, began to see Raymond in a much more different light after he "Rescued" them from their Communist Chinese captors. When ever asked about what they thought of Raymond they would say with a blank stare and emotionless voice that Raymond "Is the kindest bravest most wonderful human being that they ever knew in their lives"!. Angela Lansbury as the power hungry and psychotic Mrs. Iselin in one of the most weirdest and scariest roles even seen in the movies. Who's so obsessed with gaining the power of the Presidency of the United States and using that power with deadly results is both unnerving and hypnotic to watch. The Soviet Union and Communist Chinese who together devised a way to manipulate Raymond's mind with the Queen of Diamonds as a trigger. This diabolical plan is later countered by Maj. Marco with an entire deck of 52 Red Queens that overloaded and blew out the circuits that were installed in Raymond's brain by them. Thus changing him from a helpless zombie under communist control into a potent killer with a hatred and vengeance against those who programed him to kill others.The only flaw that I found in the movie "The Manchurian Candidate" was that of Euguine Rose Chaney, Janet Leigh. She seemed to have no reason for being in the movie unless her role was drastically cut down to where it made little or no sense at all in order to shorten the movie to it's already over long 126 minute final print. The movie "Manchurian Candidate" grabs you right from the opening credits and never lets go and even when it's over you just can't, like Maj. Marco and Raymond Shaw and every one else in that US Army unit in Korea, get it out of your mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This has one very effective element, and it is strong enough to make it of historical importance. I'm talking about the incorrectly termed `dream' sequence. It is actually a dream, a real presentation, and the image of the gardening lecture impressed on their minds. At some times, elements of one bleed into the other.This is the stuff of Lewis Carroll, in fact invented by him, a fact here acknowledged with the incestuous Red Queen as a card. The hero's love is a genie: `Rose,' also from Alice (and the Shakespeare he quotes).The film isn't as explicit as the Alice books, but the core notion is here: our behavior is programmed by the logic we adopt, even when it is artificial. And nowhere is it more artificial than in politics.So we have the traditional folding of a play within a play: this performance about politics as a performance fighting the unwitting performer.The acting is dreadful. Never mind. That set of scenes is enough.Ted's Evaluation: 2 of 4 -- Has some interesting elements</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll start on a positive note: at times this is a great looking film - lovely b&amp;W photography and occasionally striking visually. That's it.Otherwise what we have here is a crude thriller devoid of any charm or humour and with a political plot so crude that it would embarrass the most populist politician of any era. There is some kind of muddled and non-committal comment about McCarthyism in here but the film shies away from any critical analysis of the era.The love interest is established in the most unconvincing manner when Janet Leigh enters the film. She seems to serve no other purpose than to reinforce Sinatra's heterosexuality and to add a little femininity to the rest of the macho lunkhead proceedings.As far as the plot is concerned all the main characters have the necessary information required to prevent the weak and predictable ending with about 20 minutes to go further robbing the proceedings of any dramatic tension or logic.Among other things a truly good film ( or even an average one ) must have some kind of internal logic, sympathetic characters, a consistent plot and some kind of internal dynamic.This film seems to continue to amass plaudits despite the fact that many of its apologists acknowledge themselves that these elements are absent.I can only ask why?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having heard so much about this film, I was delighted to receive a DVD copy as a birthday present. Imagine my horror when myself and four friends sat down to watch a noir classic, only to discover it was a badly-written and overwrought piece of froth.Time and time again, I've seen 'Candidate' in best of lists. I cannot imagine why, unless, a la Citizen Kane, the myth about the film becomes greater than the film itself. It is ponderous, long, stifling, claustrophobic and unpleasant. It's an obvious product of the Cold War, but as a complete antithesis to say the wonderful 'Dr Strangelove', it has nothing to say about the period and serves only to reinforce the awful anti-Communist prejudice of that dark era.Sinatra gives a heroic performance but is let down by a ham-fisted script and some hyperbolic direction. The only nomination I'd give this candidate is 'Most Over-rated Film of All Time'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing A Deadly Game Of Solitare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate has some good points and bad points. I rented this movie due impart to the reviews, and the classic cast. The movie started out good; but then it got too long. The movie takes place during the end of the Korean War. A group of G.I.'s are ambushed the Manchuria boarder, near Russian/china. Once they are captured, they are taken to garden club/training center. It is a place where they show an audience the effects of brainwashing, on these Korean soldiers. Raymond Shaw(Laurence Harvey) is the key. They have effective turned him into an assassin. His fellow G.I.'s are there to witness the experiments. Shaw's trigger is though the game of Solitaire. Once he plays he is under complete control. When the Queen of Diamonds appears he does what his operatives tell him to do. Among the group is Major Bennett Marco(Frank Sinatra. When the experiments starts Shaw is told to shot one of his fellow G.I.'s in the head; and he does.When Shaw comes home from Korea, he is viewed as a war hero; by the public; but it is all a cover. The only ones that know what he really is, is his operatives; even Major Marco is fooled. His operatives are his mother, Mrs Islin(Angela Landsbury) and his Father Senator Islin(James Gregory). They appear to be a power hungry couple who believe some Americans are Communists. Raymond hates his mother, because she has always been so controlling and mean. When two of the G.I.s start having nightmares of the capture and experiences at the garden club, Marco starts to suspect something has happened to Shaw. Marco and Cpl. Allen Melvin( James Edwards)are called in to identify subjects. They both identify the same men. They appear to powerful government agents, who are involved in experimental research.Shaw tries to put his life back together again, he meets Jocelyn Jordan(Leslie Parrish). He wants to start over again, but his mother doesn't like the Jordan's especially her father Senator Thomas Jordan( John McGiver). Islin thinks they are communists, but later she has a change of heart, but involves a diabolical plot. Shaw is trying to get back to normal, but whenever he plays Solitaire, and the Queen of Diamonds appears it has an effect on him. He does strange stuff, like jumping into a lake, while Marco wonders why? Shaw also eventually kills Jocelyn, his wife; and Sen. Thomas his father-in-law, in the Jordan's home. Near the end of the movie Shaw's mom pulls out the cards for one final time, for assassination so they can work their way into the White House. When Marco( Sinatra) finds out what has happened to Shaw he tries to reverse his brainwashing hoping for positive results. Once Shaw is at the Stadium for the Presidential speech, it looks like Shaw is going to complete the mission. Instead he kills his operatives, his mother and father. The ending turns out to be tragic anyway, because of the abuse, and being brainwashed, Shaw turns the gun on himself.I liked the movie because of the storyline. The reason why I gave it 6/10 is it was boring in parts; and drawn out. I haven't seen the re-make so I can't compare it to this one. To those who see it be prepared for a great storyline, but being slow moving kills the rating. Still this movie is worth the rental and shows the dangerous effect of brainwashing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>cut down on Harvey and more Sinatra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1952, a group of American soldiers are captured in Korea and brainwashed by the enemy. Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) returns home having won the Medal of Honor pushed by his domineering mother Mrs. Eleanor Iselin (Angela Lansbury) who is driving the career of her new foolish McCarthyian husband Senator John Yerkes Iselin (James Gregory). Major Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) commanded Shaw and recommended him for the medal. However he's haunted by nightmares of the brainwashing sessions. He is being sidelines after a debacle with Iselin. He encounters Rosie Chaney (Janet Leigh) on the train. Others of his unit are having the same dreams. Meanwhile the brainwashing makes Shaw susceptible to suggestions after seeing the Queen of diamonds.The story is convoluted but the problem is that it's executed with very little excitement. It takes too long to get to the point. The dialog is stilted. It's all a bit too tired. Laurence Harvey is actually very stiff and bitter which make it hard to watch him. His role should be cut back. This movie should follow much more Frank Sinatra. He's the more compelling character anyways. This should be solely his movie. He may not be the best actor ever, but his side of the story is the most compelling of the lot. The satirical bent on the McCarthyism is interesting and Lansbury delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original Manchurian Candidate was a curiosity in 1962 due to the Cuban missile crisis. The political environment was just past the McCarthy witch hunts and the plot is loosely based on that event.Sargeant Shaw(Lawrence Harvey) has returned from Korea and is a medal of honor hero. Captain Marco(Frank Sinatra) starts having nightmares which are the same as one of his soldiers. Meanwhile, Shaw's mother, played chillingly by Angela Lansbury, is married to a McCarthy like senator on a power trip. Mind control is the main story line and director John Frankenheimer delivers big time. A remake was made in 2004 starring Denzel Washington.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome film but the premise is flawed.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this film, the sets, the acting, the lighting, the surrealism of some of the scenes and some shocking violence to boot, the only problem i had with this film is the central premise, if the whole point of the plot is to kill the Republican party nominee thus allowing the vice presidential nominee to become the President allowing the Communists to have a puppet in the Whitehouse why did they go to the trouble of brainwashing the son of one of their US agents.This plot device would of made sense if the brainwashed soldier was chosen because of his mothers status in the Republican Party, thus allowing him unfettered access to the two potential high profile targets, however when he did turn up to the Republican Party conference to carry out the killing he was dressed as a Priest !?!?!?!? which would surely have attracted the attention of the security services, especially as he was carrying a large box, remember we are in the era of Cold War paranoia so i imagine security would be ultra tight for these people and these events but given the seeming lack of security i cannot see why the Soviets could not of used one of their own agents to do the shootings of both the Senator and the Presidential nominee, which was all that was needed for the Communist plot to take shape, if this inconsistency had been fixed by stressing the wall of security that "should" of surrounded the intended victims and the assassin was not dressed as a Priest the film would have been a masterpiece, however it will remain forever flawed in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love the acting. I even love Laurence Harvey. The problem is that the plot falls apart because the left leaning liberals who made it couldn't help themselves. They had no choice but to make the foreign bad guys the bad guys (i.e., the Communist Chinese, North Koreans and Russians) but when it came to the domestic bad guys, their little leftist hearts couldn't help it. They somehow muddled it and made the second banana bad guy a parody of Sen. McCarthy and the evil mother a Communist plant but the rationale for using her son made no sense either. Pity because if the suits had been able to think straight, they would have made the domestic bad guys Communist agents (Alger Hiss, anyone) and had their targets been the right. Now that would have made sense. Dig the Lincoln portraits in the cabin? Russian agent-Republicans outing Communists while acting on behalf of their Communist overlords. Well, the left feels rather than thinks which simplifies the task of brain washing considerably.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) is one of the most nail-bitingly tense films I have ever seen (and no; I have not seen Alfred Hitchcock's "Psycho"). The plot is something Hitchcock might have used; the son (played magnificently in a once in a life time performance by Laurence Harvey) of a prominent, right-wing political family has been brainwashed as an unwitting assassin for an international Communist conspiracy. Frank Sinatra is also extremely good as Bennett Marco, proving once and for all, that apart from singing, he can act very well. Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Iselin, and James Gregory as Senator John Yerkes Iselin are all very good (Lansbury was nominated for a Academy Award), but its Laurence Harvey who is absolutely fantastic. How he never won the Best Actor Academy Award beats me. A edge of your seat movie. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic thriller with a few rough edges</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is a landmark political thriller from the cold war era. Its staying power has proved sufficient enough to inspire a re-make five years ago under the direction of Jonathan Demme.The story revolves around a Communist plot to brainwash American POWs and use one of them as an unwitting assassin. Everything proceeds as planned until some of the soldiers begin having strange dreams. The mystery begins to unravel but it may be too late to stop the events already set into motion.The cast is well-assembled from the leads on down to the supporting roles. Frank Sinatra isn't bad as the leading man though I much preferred Laurence Harvey's frequent transformations from chilly war hero to robot-like assassin. Angela Lansbury, in the film's single best performance, secured an Oscar nomination in the role of Harvey's sinister mother. Not faring as well was Janet Leigh, though that's mainly because her character is underwritten and seemingly of little consequence.Frankenheimer's direction is well-executed and shows some very interesting touches at times. Especially noteworthy are the dream sequences which are also undoubtedly the main reason why the film was nominated for an Editing Oscar. The score is decent as well but rarely grabs your attention.As much as I appreciate the film's best elements I have to admit that unfortunately some rough edges hurt the film a little. Mainly I feel that the script could have used some work but the film's problems do not negate the strengths by any means. Thus, I recommend the film though I don't quite concur with its high rating.</fullReview>

Sinatra gives one of his best performances as an army officer who gradually recalls what really happened in Korea, but the acting honors go to Harvey and Lansbury. Harvey has the role of his career as the troubled hero while Lansbury is brilliant as his mother (the actress was only three years older than Harvey!), a woman with political aspirations. Leigh seems to have wandered in from another movie; her train scene with Sinatra is bizarre. Frankenheimer's direction is very effective, with the stark cinematography lending a sense of gritty realism.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant 1960s Paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've said this before: the 1960s were a wonderful decade for film-making, so many powerful and influential films emerged from the turbulence of those times: The Miracle Worker, The Graduate, Rosemary's Baby, Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, etc. These movies and many more were groundbreaking films, and I don't think there has ever been a time when film meshed so perfectly with the collective consciousness. As weird and twisted as the plot might seem, The Manchurian Candidate is no exception. To anyone who doubts the influence of film in the 1960s, one need only look at its ugly cousin, television, which spared no idea no matter how wacky: genies, talking cars, talking horses, munsters, martians, rich hillbillies, suburban housewife witches, and special agent wild west matadors.The premise of the film is way out there, but you see a film to suspend disbelief and be entertained. It doesn't matter if you can't swallow the notion that a man's sense of morality could be so badly compromised that he would blithely shoot his fellow soldier upon command, what gives the film credibility are the strong, powerful images that it portrays. It is a small leap of logic to believe that powerful interests really are controlling our minds, for example look at how biased and narrow-minded the news media are: the same five stories are reported over and over on all the networks, on all the news websites, in all the magazines, and on the radio. Why is this? I think at the very least this film should make us question authority, and who has the right to control the information that goes into our brains. In other words, stop being a sheep.Much has been written about Angela Lansbury's bravura, over-the-top performance as the monster-mom queen of diamonds. Pushy, ambitious, arrogant, and downright nasty, she steals every scene she appears in. If all you know of her acting range is the lovable, easygoing Jessica Fletcher from her TV show, here she will knock your socks off as Jessica's exact opposite. Her husband, Senator Iselin, is basically a patsy, a figurehead that she manipulates to say whatever she wants him to say. It is amusing that, twenty years after this film, the U.S. would have a president and first lady who so closely resemble these two people. Life imitating art.This fascinating film is not without its flaws. I found myself wishing that someone other than Frank Sinatra was cast as Marco. I'm sure he's okay in other films, but here his hamhanded delivery and meatball facial expressions are ill-suited to the task at hand. Imagine Peter O'Toole or Rock Hudson in the role, trying to carefully figure out what's going on; you can't see the wheels turning in Sinatra's head because he's basically playing himself. I'm sure Frankenheimer was secretly frustrated at Sinatra's limited range, but whom could he complain to without getting whacked by the mob.Janet Leigh is in here for some reason, she just appears out of nowhere, dumps her fiance, and moves in with Meatball. No backstory, nothing. The reptilian Laurence Harvey is perfectly cast as Raymond Shaw, the engineered assassin: cold, friendless, soft-spoken, he gives you the creeps every time he appears on screen. It's difficult to imagine such a character as a protagonist, but Frankenheimer actually manages to pull it off. You really want to see Shaw emerge from his brainwashing as his own man with his own life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is one of the first modern political thrillers. It explores the possibility of brainwashing and hypnotizing people to carry out their plots. Specifically, Communist agents attempt to seize the White House by manipulating Sergeant Raymond Shaw, a Medal of Honor recipient.The acting is excellent. Frank Sinatra is solid as the "good guy" Major Bennet Marco. Laurence Harvey pulls off the tough role of Raymond Shaw, an unlikable but sympathetic tool. Angela Lansbury is menacing as his Communist mother, Mrs. Iselin. She was everything that a villain should be. Her husband, Senator John Yerkes Iselin, is the buffoon who threatens to take the Presidency. He fits nicely as a comedic but foolish companion.The plot had me confused at first. It took about half an hour for the story to start making sense. After that, it was exciting to see the questions slowly answered. The conclusion is very suspenseful, with a shocking surprise ending.The film finds an effective balance between many different moods. There is comedy with Senator Iselin, the apartment Karate fight, and Shaw's relationship with his girlfriend. There is dark political drama with brainwashing, Communism, and assassinations. There is emotional tension with Shaw's hypnotism and disturbing family relationship.The Manchurian Candidate is an impressive achievement for its time and continues to have value today. Although the Communist threat might be over, politics are more important than ever.</fullReview>

I have seen a lot of the great films from the 70's on up, and a couple from the 60's, but I have always wished i could get my hands on some of the original classics like the Hitchcock movies, Citizen Kane, and of course, The Manchurian Candidate.Well finally tonight I got to see it. I wasn't sure what to expect, I really don't mind black and white and i was certainly not so closed-minded to believe a movie would be unentertaining because it was old, but still i didn't know if I would think it was too cheesy or not.But while there were a FEW cheesy, or perhaps too quickly edited scenes, the film overall was fantastic. The script was original and interesting, the filming styles were brilliant, and the acting, despite the couple of said cheesy parts, was incredible. I could say that i was very impressed with the leads, Sinatra and Harvey, but I would feel that i would be undermining the great performances of almost everyone else in the film.The film kept me interested the whole time, the twists in the plot were well executed, I was truly affected by many of the scenes more than in quite a lot of more modern films i've seen.Overall this was a fantastic film and I can see why it is considered a classic. I enjoyed watching it more than i could have expected and I will certainly be wanting to see more of these older films.</fullReview>

Watching it again does nothing to reduce one's enjoyment. The power, originality &amp; courage of this script, the fine acting (especially by Harvey &amp; Lansbury) &amp; the 'what if' thoughts this story inspires all make it one of those films that viewers are very unlikely to forget. OK, Sinatra was not a great actor -- but if acting ability was the criteria for being in films, the profession would be a lot less crowded! The best thing about this film is the lack of hysteria, the total calm, almost matter of fact way it plays. Being in black &amp; white also adds to the impact. To summarise: if you haven't seen either the '62 or '04 version, watch this one first -- &amp; stop there!

I must admit, however, that the "dream' sequences are a little confusing for a first-time viewer (my wife), but that's the beauty of video, and the chance to watch it again. Even I knew what was going to happen next, it never failed to grab me with its high level of tension. What is even more amazing, is how this movie is clearly best in black and white.

		<shortDescription>Ultimate Evil is Right-Wing GOP Evil</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film does not portray communist Russians and Koreans as good guys, however the really monstrous evil is that of right-wing Republican Americans, as embodied by Angela Lansbury, an evil, reptilian mother no son could love. The plot is convoluted, with rightist Angela conspiring with the communists (of all people!) to use her brainwashed son as an assassin, the tool to send her idiot husband to the White House. The husband is a ludicrous copy of Senator McCarthy, ranting and raving about "245 Communists in the U.S. government" and causing an uproar in a congressional committee meeting. One liberal senator, invited to her house party, calls it "a fascist party" and Angela decides to have him taken out -- after all, he is "a communist". We learn her ultimate goal is to have her husband elevated to the presidency by assassination, whereupon they (she) will turn the U.S. into a totalitarian state and in a bloodbath, eliminate her communist enemies. Her home is tastefully furnished, and there are a number of Abraham Lincoln busts which the camera remains on for an inordinate amount of time. (Hey! We get the picture already -- Republican, Republican, Republican!)For the record I am neither a Republican lover nor a Democrat basher, but an Independent in the political arena. I have no ax to grind with either Elephant or Donkey, per se, which is not to say that I do not disagree with both parties on occasion.Incidentally, I did not see this film when it came out in 1962, but only last night for the first time, on Turner Classic Movies. I gave it a 7 out of 10 as an engrossing cold war-era drama, with the actors giving a good account of themselves. I recommend it for viewing, with the only caveat for viewers being that it carries a strong leftist message. This, depending on the viewer's inclination, may please you or on the other hand, just might make you a very unhappy camper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still the best political paranoia thriller over forty years later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is still the best political paranoia thriller over forty years later. It has also not dated as poorly as many other films of the same era. Despite the tension and suspense, this is essentially a very skilled satire of the darkest kind. It effectively skewers and shows the dangers of both the far left and the far right. But unlike many modern political thrillers (such as those being made by Oliver Stone), you don't have to understand the social implications to enjoy it. It is a quickly-paced thrill ride with fantastic direction and cinematography, a clever and well-rounded screenplay, and some fine performances.John Frankenheimer made many other films such as this. However, here he got everything right. Despite coming close several times (notably "Seconds"), he never topped "The Manchurian Candidate". The acting is very good and creates some interesting characters. Special notice must go to Frank Sinatra. Everyone thinks of him as a crooner, but I've always felt he was a fine actor. Even when the material was sub-par (such as the incredibly overrated "Suddenly"), he could always be depended on for a good performance. Laurence Harvey is cold but ultimately sympathetic as the brainwashed Raymond Shaw. And as his mother, Angela Lansbury is one of the most repulsive villains in film.One thing I always enjoyed about this film was the slight surrealism. The dream sequences are disorienting and bizarre but so is the dialog. Janet Leigh's lines seem more suited for Groucho Marx. Like "Kiss Me Deadly" and "Night of the Hunter", this is a Hollywood film from the classic era that includes some surreal and dreamlike aspects. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Manchurian Candidate was a picture that was definitely a head of it's time. The first time I viewed this movie, I was rather perplexed, it was rather difficult for me to understand. However, the second time I watched it, I really, really enjoyed it. I recommend first time viewers really pay close attention to this movie, because it's rather easy to get lost.Additionally, both Sinatra and Landsburry give excellent performances in this film. More often than not, Sinatra is a under rated actor. However, when given a great script (such as the one in this film), Sinatra truly shines and is at his best in dramatic roles. Also, I find that the film has aged well since it's release in the 1960's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I wanted a killer from a world filled with killers and they chose you..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got the same feeling watching "The Manchurian Candidate" as I did as a fourth grader going through those 'duck and cover' air raid drills in the mid 1950's, the threat of those Communist Russkies ever impinging on a precocious young mind. The film is claustrophobic and sinister, a holdover from the McCarthy era where a Commie was to be found behind every bush, and maybe worse, holding high political office.Not having seen the movie before, I didn't know what to expect. I found the early scenes demonstrating the effectiveness of the Chinese brainwashing techniques on the captured American patrol to be uniquely original. Obviously disorienting from the start with the discourse on hydrangeas, the periodic shifts between the contrived and real audience was very well done; the touch with the all black floral society was a master stroke.Frank Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are terrific in their roles, but the real scene stealer is Angela Lansbury as Shaw's manipulative mother. Lansbury is so good in fact, that you begin to question how she would have fallen in with a sop like Big John Iselin (James Gregory), who wouldn't even dare to address the whole 'just how many communists are there' question for himself. There's a quite revealing insight into her controlling nature when early in the story she addresses John and son Robert as her 'two little boys'.What's probably too bad though, but as the film progresses, more and more elements begin to surface that tend to exaggerate the entire premise of the story. I was intrigued by the issue of Shaw having all guilt and fear removed from his psyche as he was built into a perfect assassin. However his selection as that assassin was never properly explored, only to be further convoluted by that overwrought and borderline incestuous kiss by momma. His soon to be bride showing up in that queen of diamonds costume also contributed to odds defying circumstances, causing this viewer a 'what the ?' reaction.I got a couple of inadvertent chuckles from the story, the first when Yen Lo (Khigh Dhiegh) checked in on Shaw (Laurence Harvey) at the converted alcohol treatment center now operated by the Russians. With glee, he chastises the Russian Zilkov (Albert Paulsen) for the facility making a profit; the Russian didn't find it amusing. The other was the martial match up between Major Marco (Sinatra) and Chunjin (Henry Silva); they really should have taken a few lessons. Sinatra's stance at one point was almost comical.As a political thriller, one would do well to concentrate on the first half of the film, up to about the point when Janet Leigh makes her appearance as the Major's romantic interest. That basically comes out of nowhere, and seemed at the outset to play like it might have been a part of the whole subversive mind game plot. It comes to naught however, left dangling like an unresolved story element. The trail to the political convention, especially following the assassination of Shaw's wife and father, is fraught with major demands for suspension of disbelief on the part of the viewer, the major one being, how did Shaw manage to elude the authorities for his crimes while under hypnotic control? By the time he sights in his rifle, one has a pretty good idea how it will all end, and with just the right symbolism. The Manchurian conspiracy falls as if constructed of a stack of cards. I'll never be able to look at a queen of Lansbury in the same way again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Sinatras Best Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Without a doubt, this is the chairman of the boards best movie role. The concept of the film was wild when it was made, but became frighteningly real when JFK was shot, causing the film to be pulled from screens for a lot of years. That is unfortunate as this film is parallel to the JFK reality in that there is a conspiracy at work in this movie too. Angela Lansbury is only 2 years older than Lawrence Harvey, but yet is believable as his mom!! This tells you something about how great an actress Angela is. Janet Leigh is here too and does fine but her role is more limited than other films. Brainwashing is the subject matter here, and this conspiracy involves an intricate brain washing &amp; set up over years to pull off. Trust me, if your patient &amp; love drama this film fits perfectly. The queen of diamonds theme is just perfect. All the cast fits this film very well. Master filmmaker John Frankheimer is in fine form with this thriller. I have not seen the recent remake of this film but I can't believe it can be any better than this original. In fact, I bet this is the one to watch.It is so rare to see Sinatra fit so well in a cast as this one. His role here is just right to fit the film. The film uses the cold war theme well enough that it should be required viewing for young folks today who have trouble understanding what the cold war was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic film with a stunning performance by Angela Lansbury</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Soldiers are brainwashed, and one is programmed as a killing machine in "The Manchurian Candidate," a 1962 film starring Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, Frank Sinatra, James Gregory, and Janet Leigh.This amazing movie was withdrawn from theaters because of the Kennedy assassination, and it was finally put back into circulation. It is a true masterpiece that turned out to be sadly prophetic. Laurence Harvey is a soldier who wins a medal of bravery for saving the lives of his platoon in Korea, all but two members - except it's all a great big lie. In truth, the entire platoon was flown to Manchuria, and a new way of brainwashing is used on them. Harvey is chosen to become a killer, and he gives a demonstration of his cold-blooded abilities by killing two members of his platoon. When the soldiers return to civilian life, two of them are plagued by terrible dreams of the incident, one being Frank Sinatra, and the army investigates. Deciding that brainwashing by the Russians was involved, the problem becomes how to deprogram Harvey...and what is his assignment.The film is not without its flaws, and it's a tribute to it that it still manages to remain a masterpiece. Laurence Harvey's accent wavers from American to British, finally settling on British. The identity of the character played by Janet Leigh, a young woman who meets Sinatra on a train, is never explained - was this perhaps cut from the film? Critic Molly Haskell felt that two of Harvey's killings were "too much to recover from" - they did seem unnecessary.The acting is superb, with the two greatest performances given by Angela Lansbury as Harvey's mother and James Gregory as her Joseph McCarthy-like senator husband, who sees Communists everywhere. Lansbury, a mere one year older than Harvey, is perfect as a mother right out of hell, and the incestuous scene toward the end is chilling. From this to Jessica Fletcher - thank God Broadway knew what to do with this master talent. As her puppet husband, Gregory gives an excellent performance as a boisterous fool. Sinatra is very natural in his role, and though Janet Leigh isn't around much, she's very good. Harvey, always a fine actor, is remarkable as a cold, unlikable, angry man who changes when he finds love, only to find that he is a servant to horrendous programming - and came from the body of the devil incarnate.A great achievement by director John Frankenheimer, and a no miss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>in the United States Senate"..., quips James Gregory as Senator Iselin-(at first he said there were hundreds, but then he got a reasonable number from the Heinz ketchup bottle)!. Classic.This film is a gem, not to be missed, Angela Lansury as the ruthless senator's wife, Frank Sinatra as the GI with post-traumatic stress, Laurence Harvey as the pawn. The scenes are desolate and haunting, ..."why not play a game of solitaire, Raymond?"..., Lansbury says, thereby triggering his automatic response after being brainwashed.There are some indelible scenes, a political party thrown by John McGiver, a rival senator. There is a decadent pie made of caviar, shaped like the American flag. As it is a costume party, Senator Iselin dresses as Abe Lincoln, (no caricature could be further from the truth, it turns out).There are also some very disturbing scenes where Sinatra has flashbacks during the brainwashing sequence, and Henry Silva, as Chunyin, is appropriately menacing and sinister. The servicemen from the war have all been brainwashed, in some form or other, and it remains a mystery as to why until the end of the film.This film is timely and haunting. The enemies, can either be externalized, or even more evil, inside ourselves. Angela Lansbury and James Gregory portray an excellent representation of political corruption and avarice. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent idea turned into a witty script, dynamically directed and expertly performed. Even after all these years, the set pieces do not disappoint: in fact, with the passage of time, they elicit more and more admiration. For example, the breathtaking 360-degree pan; Sinatra's dialogue with Leigh on the train; the confrontation at the fancy dress party between McGiver and Lansbury, followed closely by Lansbury's thoroughly chilling mother-and-son scene with Harvey; and of course the superb finale at the convention.The tone of the film is unsettling throughout - often slyly comic, just as often scary and disquieting. It's as if it's an expression of Marco's muddled mind. Yet it never quite fits neatly into the comedy-thriller mould: Axelrod and Frankenheimer were much too canny for that. There is something wonderfully unreal about the world in which Sinatra's character moves, making his intense, anguished, thoroughly real performance - surely his best - all the more sympathetic.Harvey's limited gifts are put to good use. His peculiar lack of sincerity makes his attempt to escape his mother's grip, through an affair with Leslie Parrish's Jocelyn Jordon, doomed from the start.I guess, though, in the end, the abiding memory is of the wonderful gallery of performances - James Gregory's spineless senator, Khigh Dhiegh's smiling villain, and of course the magnificent Lansbury, for whom not even La Streep was a match. The remake, in spite of its many good qualities, is too bloated, simply not a patch on the spare, intense, original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blows me away every time I watch it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's older than I am, it's in black and white, and I'm watching it for the 3rd time this week.Take a U.S. patrol in Korea, have them led into capture, then suddenly the platoon is home, Sgt. Shaw (Laurence Harvey)has won the Congressional Medal Of Honor, and everything is peachy. Except that Ben Marco (Sinatra) wakes up screaming every night. And thereby hangs a alternately funny, frightening, satirical and tragic tale.I'd always viewed Frank Sinatra as a singer who merely dabbled in acting. Then I saw this movie and was picking my jaw off the floor. The train scene with Janet Leigh is mesmerizing. Sinatra as Marco looks like a man about to completely disintegrate while trying not to show it in front of Leigh. It's so good that I didn't even question until after the movie why Rosie (Leigh) would give her address and phone # to a guy twitching so badly he can't light a cigarette. People have questioned what Leigh's character is for in this movie, as she's not in the armed forces, or politics, or a victim. It's simple... she's the sounding board so Marco can talk to somebody who doesn't think he's nuts, so he can get what he suspects off his chest before he does go nuts.Anglea Lansbury as Raymond Shaw's mother is one of the scariest political creatures you'll ever meet. She yanks her senator husband around like a dog, sets up his speeches, yammers at Raymond until he just covers his ears, torpedoes his one true love affair for political revenge, and slanders any opposition as "communists". James Gregory as Senator Iselin is a cartoon caricature of Joe McCarthy who asks his wife to please give him just one number of known communists in the defense department so he can remember it and not look like an idiot.And then there's Laurence Harvey as Raymond Shaw. For the first half of the movie, the unknowingly brainwashed Shaw is icy, disdainful, kills 2 people in the first 1/2 hour, and still a more sympathetic character than his mother. And then his walls come tumbling down while drinking with his new "friend" Marco. Starting with a typically Raymond cynical commentary on Christmas, a progressively drunker Shaw then spills the story of how he, a man who knows "I'm not lovable" fell in love with the daughter of Iselin's political enemy, Senator Jordan, only to have have his mother break them up. By the end of the scene, Shaw has crumpled into a hunchback on the brink of tears saying "I did love her, I do love her" Which makes what his mother does to him after that even more chilling.The final dominoes (and bodies) fall leading up the party nomination convention, as Marco races to find Shaw before this man who Marco now really does consider a friend destroys himself along with his victims.Although I do like Denzel Washington, this film never should have been remade. Some things you simply can't top.</fullReview>

I was just a little freaked out about it to say the least. I called my wife and told her to keep an eye on me for the next few days to see if I acted....Strange.

You can see why this might have cut a little too close to the Kennedy tragedy in Dallas. A rather spacey Janet Leigh shares playful dialogue with a tough as shoe leather Frank Sinatra, involved in one of Hollywood's best fight scenes (beating up the always beat up Henry Silva, years before Steven Seagal did). Each main character is either trying or not trying to unravel the mystery behind all those bullets and nightmares. Recently deceased John Frankenheimer never matched this masterwork for directorial verve. The camera tricks are riveting. Especially when fact and fiction are playing tricks on your perception.

		<fullReview>Aside from 'The Shining', 'The Manchurian Candidate' is definitely the greatest thriller ever made. So many things are revealed to us through this movie, the horrors of war, corruption in government, the strength of will power and so much more. This is the ideal psychological thriller. The acting in this film is beyond excellent, especially by Sinatra as the Major Bennett Marco who has to single-handedly prevent a political assassination done by an American vet who was brainwashed as a part of a communist conspiracy. Lawrence Harvey plays the brainwashed soldier and his performance is nothing less than astounding. When I watched this movie a second time I was still riveted even though I knew what was going to happen and how the movie would turn out. That's the kind of movie this is. The storyline, acting and directing is so superb that no matter how many times you see this, you still are at the edge of your seat with suspense. The casting for this movie was perfect and Angela Lansbury puts in a great performance as the warped mother of Lawrence Harvey. If you are in the mood for a good thriller than don't rent some dumb film like ?Scream', or ?I Know What You Did Last Summer', watch ?The Manchurian Candidate'. I promise you will love this film. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just sat down and watched The Manchurian Candidate for the first time... and WOW, what a movie.***HERE COME SOME SPOILERS-DON'T READ THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE***---The dream sequence was one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen in an 'older' movie; it really throws you into a conspiritorial mindset, ready to keep on your toes while watching the film. And Angela Lansbury--I didn't know she could be so EVIL! Frank was awesome, as usual, and his little scene about Christmas/Buddha/and the "big magilla" seem like something that could have been an outtake from Pulp Fiction... I saw an interview with him after the video where he said he broke his hand in the fight scene with the Korean houseboy.One bit of 'symbolism' I caught--maybe I'm reading too much into this, but Janet Leigh's character tells Sinatra on the train that her name is Eugenie 'Rose' -- she mentions the French Empress Eugenie... RED QUEEN!!!! I was sure she was part of the whole deal. But she just sort of faded out of the story.Frank's character caused me a couple of problems, too. Why was he reading so much, and about so many odd subjects, when he got back home? And WHO was sending him the stuff from San Francisco? And how did he break HIS conditioning? Minor plot hole, not enough to make me worry. The other one is this--how in the world could the Vice-Presidential candidate's step-son go roaming around the National Convention hall in a priest getup without being seen? Oh well. Regardless...***END SPOILERS***This movie had me on the edge of my chair from the first scene. I think I said "Oh my GOD!!" out loud at least 4 or 5 times. It is a true classic. HIGHLY recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tribute to Frankenheimer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The recent death of John Frankenheimer is perhaps an appropriate moment to comment on what was undoubtedly his masterpiece and reflect on his place in American cinema. His greatest achievement was to extend the Hollywood golden age, which in so many respects reached its natural end in the 'fifties into the early years of the 'sixties. Admittedly Hitchcock was still around, but Hitchcock was a legendary figure and far from spent as "The Birds" and "Marnie" were triumphantly to prove. But Frankenheimer was a comparatively new talent with a very special gift for the conspiracy/political thriller. He gave us two superlative films in this genre, "The Manchurian Candidate" and "Seven Days in May". Thereafter his work became increasingly more uneven although there were some good things in "The Train", a French resistance wartime thriller and "Seconds" an interesting but overlong piece of science-fiction. I have always dated the eventual demise of Hollywood as we knew it from the release of Peter Yates's "Bullet" in 1968, a film in which the superficiality of a spectacular car chase was the raison d'etre rather than character. It was sad that a director as talented as Frankenheimer joined the cheap thrills brigade with "The French Connection II" after which we rather lost sight of him. Still, at least we can continue to derive enormous pleasure from "The Manchurian Candidate", a conspiracy thriller about Cold War intrigue that has never been equalled, much less surpassed. Others such as "Arlington Road" and "The Parallax Factor" are just light years away in comparison. Just to hint at a plot so diabolical in its concept and implications would involve so many SPOILERS that is is best to leave it alone and simply say that it has the most fiendishly cunning villain in film history, a wonderfully witty script (that reference to a sauce bottle and the consequences of a character thinking he has been told to jump into a lake), an exquisitely tender romantic interlude - almost a film within a film - of a summer when an "unlovable" character become "lovable", the finest performances Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury ever gave and a superlative score by David Amram, all of which add up to one of the most entertaining films of them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Solitaire Classic Of A Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a very chilling, thought-provoking movie with much intrigue and suspense. To some it could seem dated and hard to believe. They obviously were not alive or are very unfamiliar with the times. Here it was early 1960's, Korea had been over for a few years and yes there was brainwashing. The cold war was at a climax with the Cuban Missile crisis, Vietnam was beginning for us. To top it all off just about a year or so later our president was assassinated by somebody with obvious soviet connections, not to mention others. It was very timely and still is today. You have to remember when this movie came out and what was going on in the world. Even so, it is still a chilling and very timely not to mention accurate movie. The performances are wonderful. Sinatra, Harvey, and the supporting cast all shine. I personally think this is Sinatra's best movie. High praise goes to Angela Lansbury for the Raymond Shaws demonic communist mother from hell. James Gregory also deserves praise as her puppet politician husband. The criticism that his character is too dumb to be believable is off. Has anybody talked to or heard some politicians talk? Believe me some are dumber than dog doodoo and that is just there thinkingprocess.They can be articulate morons. If they didn't have press secretaries, advisors and all the support staff they would be one level up from retarded.Besides he is a puppet, you don't need intelligence for that. The movie makes you think while keeping you engrossed in the complicated, well thought out and long planned assassinations plans. This is the best of the assassination political thriller dramas. The climax and the ending are amongst the best. you feel the pain and sorrow Laurence Harvey conveys in his closing words to Frank Sinatra. Frankenheimer made a brilliant and gripping political masterpiece.</fullReview>

I remember hearing rumours of captured American soldiers being 'brainwashed' by the commies until they(gasp!) no longer believed in 'the land of the free'. How could God let thishappen?Freud had a hand in the plot, as well as Shakespeare. Or maybe Shakespearejust got there first. Who do you really want to kill, Raymond?What a brilliant actor Frank Sinatra was. Shame he insisted on singing instead.A few gripes: 1. The fake sweat that is sprayed liberally onto the face of anyone acting an emotional crisis. 2. The 'romantic', 'humorous' banter between the two young couples is reallytoe-curling.3. The accents adopted by Hervey and Lansbury. Hers slips occasionally (shesays 'Shaw' the English way). His is caricature 'teddibly British' but refers to his houseboy as a 'Boodist', the American way.xxxxxxx</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Scary and Heartbreaking Landmark Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is a tense and dramatic political thriller. Released in theatres in 1962, this film hit hard amongst the American public which saw it before it was promptly banned due to the events which soon followed. "Life...", I suppose "...imitates art." (art, of course being a loose term). It is as difficult a film to watch as it is to get away from. Except for a few racially stereotypical elements, 50's TV show style cinematography and rather odd moments and scenes, this is still a great film. These are most the details that I can say about the film without ruining the enjoyment for the others who have not seen it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is an intense film. Quite possibly my most favorite film of all time. Before I rented this film, I was a little skeptical about Frank Sinatra being in it, however, I was not disappointed in his performance.Angela Landsbury steals the show as she plays the evil psycho mother who calls all the shots. ** Slight Spoiler ** The part where she says, "Raymond, why don't you pass the time with a game of solitare" scared the S@#$ out of me! ** End Spoiler **Brainwashing and the psychological elements in this movie draws the audience closer with intrigue and terror at the same time. Society will always fear the unknown, and will be forever mesmorized by these "taboo" subjects. This is what allows "The Manchurian Candidate" to survive the test of time. A MUST see movie. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the top 100 films of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time that I saw this classic thriller was when I a student taking film classes back in the late 1980's. When this film was re-released into theatres in 1987 (25 years after its initial release),it brought chills down my spine and had me thinking about it very deeply. I got a chance to see it again last night on video,and it still haunts me especially seeing Laurence Harvey's character taken and brainwashed into killing a political conspiractor. The performances here and very breathtaking and every time I see it has me nailed to the edge of my seat. They can say all about Angela Lansbury's villianous portrayal of the sinister mother(in true Mommie Dearest format),but when it comes down to the nitty gritty,the chairman of the board(Frank Sinatra) gives the most famous gripping scene in motion picture history,and it shows in brillant capacity and in startling black and white effects. One of the top 100 films of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" was withdrawn from circulation for years, rumour had it due to the uncomfortable resonance of the plot in post-Kennedy assassination America. In fact it was because of a dispute between Sinatra and United Artists over the profitability or otherwise of the picture. Sinatra's utter charisma is evident in this cracking political thriller. Laurence Harvey's platoon commander returns a war hero, idolised by his men, who nevertheless have nightmares in which he murders their comrades in a sedate ladies gardening club, and vague memories that he wasn't as a sound as he's supposed to be. Harvey's mother Lansbury (of Murder She Wrote fame) is the ultra-right wing power behind her hick senator husband.Any more of the plot would be a give-away, although highlights include Hollywood's first martial arts fight, Sinatra's first encounter with Leigh on a train (the romantic subplot is otherwise rather superfluous), Harvey's desperation and confusion, and the whole edgy, paranoid atmosphere of the piece. "The Manchurian Candidate" has the reputation of being a liberal, slightly counter-cultural film, but its politics are ultimately quite right wing, and while Senator Joseph McCarthy would have despised the brilliant lampooning of right-wing US politics, he would have been pleased with the final pay-off. Forget that though, just sit back, relax, and enjoy the trip.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A couple points about a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So many other comments capture the greatness of this essential movie viewing experience, I thought I'd just make a couple comments:1. Janet Leigh. Some speculate her character must be an operative; others a waste of time in an otherwise spectacular film. I have to disagree with the former -- in order for Leigh to be on the train at that time would require a depth of surveillance intelligence by the Communists that would have undermined Marco's attempts to uncover the problems with Raymond Shaw. And since Marco talked freely with Rosie about his plans for Shaw, wouldn't the Communists tried to stop Marco from destroying their ultimate plan, which, but for Marco, would have succeeded? I must disagree with those who find Leigh's character pointless -- she provides a lighter tone to the picture and allows us to see the gentler side of Marco -- this serves to provide some relaxing moments before racheting up the tension. What is initially jarring is the light speed rate of their romance, and her initial attraction to Marco. But remember -- Sinatra was playing Marco -- one of the most charismatic, virile men to walk the planet. Even in his shaky state on the train, it's not surprising that a strong woman like Rosie would be drawn to him. Leigh gives a great performance, given how sketchy the character is.2. James Gregory as Iselin -- is his performance to broad. Is it unbelievable that a clown like him could be nominated veep? Iselin is the major comic relief throughout the film. Moreover, look at the plastic nature of Gore and the bumbling aspect of Bush and I don't think it's that farfetched.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Huh. Turns out Sinatra COULD act..."The Manchurian Candidate" is one of those movies that immediately pulls you in and won't let go until the end. I have to applaud how John Frankenheimer balances suspense and humor like a master. Note to Oliver Stone: you don't need to bludgeon your audience over the head with conspiracy theories, subtlety works much better, and is infinitely more disturbing.There are so many fantastic performances in this movie. Frank Sinatra provides a good hero, a man who starts out doubting his own sanity, then gets caught up in the desperate race to save Raymond Shaw. Laurence Harvey's Shaw is a paradox: he is about as unlikeable a person as you would ever want to meet, but you can't help but feel sorry for him as his life flies apart. Angela Lansbury's character is so far away from the kindly image we have of her today, it's hard to believe it's the same person, but she pulls it off.One minor quibble: just why is Janet Leigh in this movie? The whole romance subplot between her and Sinatra felt tacked-on, obligatory. If she were in fact another Communist agent, Sinatra's controller (as some have suggested), then they should have fleshed it out. As is, her scenes seem like an afterthought. Oh, and the Lincoln imagery was a little heavy-handed, too. C'mon, Frankenheimer, we get the point...In spite of that, "The Manchurian Candidate" succeeds as a fast-paced, intelligent thriller. This is the sort of movie I'm going to need to see over and over to catch everything. After all, it has Raymond Shaw in it, and he's the bravest, kindest, best character I've ever seen...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Familiar themes; innovative treatment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Those who lived through the Cold War fears of infiltration, brainwashing, domino-theories and the like will more easily comprehend the paranoia that Americans lived with in the otherwise-Fabulous Fifties. Those born after this period may not fully comprehend the 'Communist Threat' paranoia of the time that led us to pay special heed to films on such themes. And this is one of the best. (For one of the worst, see "My Son John".)A certain suspension of disbelief is necessary in "The Manchurian Candidate", which will forgive some plot holes here and there. The most serious flaw is James Gregory's cartoonishly-overacted, overdrawn performance as Senator Iselin. I could never believe that an oaf such as Iselin, as Gregory portrays him, could rise to such heights of political power. Furthermore it's clear that the character of Iselin had precious little respect from his fictional colleagues to begin with, and suddenly there he is, a sitcom-like clown, up for the office of vice-president. The small part of Iselin could have been given great sensitivity, even pathos, by an understated performance. (I think Gig Young could have pulled it off well.)As for Janet Leigh: any excuse to include her in any film is acceptible, in my book. Her two main scenes lit up the screen, whether directly-relevant to the plot or not. The Sinatra-Leigh and Harvey-Parrish love scenes added welcome contrast to the self-serving harshness within the Gregory-Lansbury pairing.Highly recommended to all but the very sensitive, and especially recommended to all students of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific thriller with moments of very dark comedy, The Manchurian Candidate is cleverly directed by John Frankenheimer, has a great script by George Axelrod and an uncredited Frankenheimer, based on Richard Condon's novel, and a terrific cast. It tells of Raymond Shaw, a Korean War hero who, it turns out, is being brainwashed by Communists to do their dirty work. Just how far they want him to go you will have to find out yourself. Laurence Harvey is disturbingly effective as Shaw. (No Oscar nomination? Shame, shame!) Frank Sinatra is also good as the general who was brainwashed along with Shaw but later uncovers the secret. And then there's Raymond's mother, a cold, calculating, manipulative, power-hungry, ambitious shrew, played by, of all people, Angela Lansbury, who is excellent and very chilling. The cheif flaw in this film is the inexplicable romance Sinatra has with Janet Leigh. What's she there for, anyway? Is she really a Korean Communist or something, but he can't see that because he's still brainwashed? If not, then there's no point to it. Otherwise, this is an excellent, unforgettable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all...I loved it! This was my first classic movie going experience and I was able to see Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, James Gregory, and John McGiver in one fantastic movie. The Manchurian Candidate is about an experiment in brainwashing dreamed up and implemented by the communistic and anti-U.S. countries during the Korean War era. While not a true story, it did have a touch of McCarthyism in it that would please any history buff. The basic story line....how to take over the Presidency by getting rid of the President and future Presidential candidate via assassination and deception....today we do it by planting 21 year old interns throughout the White House (just kidding). I don't recall seeing Laurence Harvey in any other movie (although he has 57 films in his film biography), but he was great as the brainwashed future assassin. Frank Sinatra was Frank Sinatra....even if you don't remember old blue eyes, go see this film and your appreciation for him as an actor will definitely have a firm foundation. Now I must also say that Angela Lansbury as an evil woman is totally not what I ever imagined...she is totally hard core. Finally, I want to mention some theaters in Milwaukee like the Times Cinema...this is a great theater that brought back memories of going to the old Majestic Theater (Cudahy), the Garden (South Milwaukee), the Avalon (still operating in Bay View) and the Cinema 1 &amp; 2 (Downtown)... you deserve a bit of nostalgia, a bit of history, and a touch of class...check out the Milwaukee Times Cinema...you'll be glad you did!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Manchurian Candidate' contains some of the finest examples of scene construction I have ever seen. The dream sequences of the brainwashing demonstration are, quite simply, beautiful in the way they look, the way they define character and the way in which the plot is developed for us.The sequence where Iselin first stands up and brandishes his list of communists is also a brilliant presentation of the media's role in politics with the use of the foreground television screens showing us the action that is taking place in the background, out of focus. These subjects could easily form the basis of a long essay so I will stop myself from going off on one, but I must say that there is definitely something weird going on with Janet Leigh's character - she has to be a 'communist agent' or there is no point for her even appearing in the film. however, I haven't read the book so maybe this is just a case of a fully rounded romantic story being squeezed into a film for the sake of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching this film, you know you're in for something special when a group of captured men are demonstrating to a group of communist leaders and to a ladies' garden club the effects of brainwashing. The men are led to believe, that is, that they are sitting in front of a group of women that talk as if they were reading from the back of a seed packet. In all actuality, thay are being introduced to a surgery room filled with various delegates as part of a massive plan to take over the US.In this dream sequence, the shots keep intercutting to different combinations--the Chinese man speaking in front of the communists, the Chinese man speaking in front of a group of ladies, the lady speaking in front of ladies, the lady speaking in front of communists... (Best Editing Oscar was lost to "How the West Was Won.")This movie still delivers. The paranoia is very high; so high that every character introduced is suspected in the back of your mind. The acting was good, too. Angela Lansbury delivered an Oscar-nominated performance as a very manipulative mother. Smart script, good jobs all around. Relatively timeless, but it must have been a great thing to watch during the era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Whittaker Chambers, the greatest anti-communist thinker of this century, once wrote that he opposed Joseph McCarthy because he saw his reckless antics as a long-term menace for the cause of anti-communism. That same kind of philosophy is really at the heart of the "Manchurian Candidate", one of the most effective political thrillers ever made. Frank Sinatra delivers his finest acting performance and there is all kinds of dramatic tension right up to the last moment. Fine performances also from Angela Lansbury and Laurence Harvey.Less effective is Janet Leigh's somewhat pointless role as Sinatra's girlfriend (when I first saw this movie in 1988, I thought for a moment that they were setting her up to be a Soviet spy, just like one of the other reviewers here thought, but now I see that they just really put her in as window dressing). Also ineffective is John McGiver as the "good" liberal senator, who frankly comes across just as self-righteously arrogant as James Gregory's red-baiting McCarthy clone (Gregory I should note almost seems like a malevolent version of his Inspector Lugar character from "Barney Miller" a decade later. The bumbling mannerisms are almost identical).The merits still outweigh the flaws. A definite must-see!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm watching it right now on AMC, for maybe the fifth time. Wasn't Leslie Parrish lovely, as always? Watch for her in the opening montage of "Mannix", now in reruns on TV Land, and in one episode starring Robert Conrad as an action-movie star.Previous remarks about Raymond's accent overlook the fact that he's the son of a woman with a distinct English accent, so once he's back from the Army, then the more time he spends with her, the more he will revert. Even adult children do that, you know.By the way, Khigh Dhiegh also played a Red Chinese brain-washing expert in perhaps the best-ever episode of "Hawaii Five-O". And isn't it odd that his fellow New Jerseyan, Frank Sinatra, made two films in eight years involving political murder by long-range rifle -- this film and "Suddenly".As for double bills, try another assassination film based on another Richard Condon novel, "Winter Kills". Or, turn off your TV and read all 15 or 20 of Condon's novels; in your mind, you'll be watching better movies than most of IMDB's Top 100. </fullReview>

He is truly one of my favorite actors of all time. This movie is so relevant, in that it suggsets that the right-wing can and probably is influenced by people and ideas that they cannot stand, but if it gives them absolute power, then that would be justification for their means.

		<fullReview>It was interesting to read BB-15's observations about the dialect maladies of the late Lawrence Harvey, because in the John Wayne film "The Alamo"(1960), Mr Harvey suffered much the same, in that in early parts of the picture he was speaking with a pseudo-Texas accent, while in the rest of the film he had his British one. But his acting skills do not suffer because of this malady. He remains as one of the best actors of English-language cinema. The film itself showcases Frank Sinatra's acting talent, as well as the versatility of Angela Lansbury as a truly hateable character. Justifiably, Sinatra chose to shelve this film after the JFK assassination, because, owing to the topicality of the film's subject matter, in those days (as, arguably, common sense would dictate) showing the picture would truly be in bad taste. But the film stands as one of the great films of the 20th century, even with the flaws previously complained about. (The film "Doctor Strangelove" made in the same period had a line change because of events surrounding the JFK assassination: When Slim Pickens, as Major Kong, was going through the contents of the aircraft survival kit, the original line was: "Shoot, a guy could have a great weekend in Dallas with all this stuff!"...the line was changed to "Vegas".)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alice in Manchuria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The CIA ran an illegal "brainwashing" programme called MKULTRA during the 1950s and 60s. Though news of the programme was only brought to the public's attention in 1974, MKULTRA's run time coincided with a number of spy, "secret agent" and "brainwashing" movies ("Ipcress File", "The Manchurian Candidate", "The Parallax View", "A Clockwork Orange", "The Spy Who Came In From The Cold", "Seven Days in May", "Dr No" etc), many of which saw unwitting suspects "brainwashed" into committing assassinations or acts of violence ("Clockwork" does the opposite, its hero brainwashed into passivity).Two of these films, "The Manchurian Candidate" (1962) and "The Parallax View" (1974), are themselves eerily similar, though they are separated by over a decade and encapsulate very different political periods. Released in 1974, Alan J. Pakula's "The Parallax View" is very blatant in its left-leaning politics. One must remember that during this time a number of nefarious news stories were being dropped into the laps of the US public. The Watergate legacy had snowballed, the Pentagon Papers had revealed that Congress had been railroaded into Vietnam, the JFK and RFK assassination theories were in full bloom, the Warren Commision was viewed with much suspicion, the killings of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King - along with numerous bizarre occurrences in which "All American Boys" snapped and went on shooting rampages - were filling the public with fear, and reality itself was seen to be a conspiracy, an act of shared pretence. Pakula's film thus captures a very specific historical mood: trust no one and fck the Man. Such pessimism is routine today. We take widespread corruption as a truth. Back then it was a kind of momentary birth of consciousness.John Frankenheimer's "The Manchurian Candidate", however, was released in 1962, and though it has on its mind the communist witch hunts and rabid MacCarthyism of the 1950s, its overall politics are harder to get a grasp of. The plot: a US infantry platoon is captured during the Korean war. The captured men are taken to Manchuria where they are brainwashed by a cabal of Chinese communists and Russian KGB agents. The platoon's leader, Sergeant Shaw, is given the specific task of killing a US senator. It is hoped that this will result in the senator's rival, Shaw's own father, becoming President of the United States. Shaw's KGB handler is his mother. Shaw's father is Senator John Iselin. Modelled on Joseph McCarthy, Iselin's a super right-wing, fear-mongering politician who exists to fan the flames of war, paranoia and anti-communist mania. For most of the film the US public views Iselin as an idiot. Once they witness the assassination of his rival by evil commies, however, they will no doubt embrace his politics and swiftly agree to his somewhat authoritarian plans (marshal law and various emergency measures). End result: the communists ? Russia and China ? would thus have a puppet dictator controlling America. Or so they think. Iselin's camp is itself merely using the enemy to get themselves elected into power.So on one hand the film seems to be in the tradition of 1950s and 1960s bash-a-commie movies, which exploited fears of "communist plots", "red invasion" and right-wing fantasies in which the Chinese and Russians band together and scheme to overthrow the White House. But while the film affirms all these possibilities, it openly mocks such fantasies and paints all these characters as rabid idiots. Even more bizarrely, while the film shows deranged right-wingers working with the Commies, Shaw's mother is herself secretly working against the communists, and Shaw's final action is not to carry out the assassination of his father's rival but to kill his mother and father instead. End result: while there may be a communist threat, rightwingers are largely using commies as bogeymen, the ideological war between Democracy and Communism is ultimately ridiculous and contemptible and the real loser is Shaw, who becomes symbolic of all innocent men who are sacrificed by all sides. The film's many ideological overlaps are encapsulated by the incestuous relationship Shaw has with his mother: everyone's in bed with one another, but he's getting screwed. Beyond this, the film's brainwashing subplot extends to all human behaviour. If all behaviour is unconsciously programmed, then this is doubly true of politics, in which all is performance, all identity is artificial, flat and everyone seems to be a puppet.Incidentally, "Candidate" was released shortly before the assassination of John F. Kennedy. And like Frankenheimer's sinister plot, Kennedy's assassination, most likely orchestrated by then vice president Lyndon B. Johnson, resulted in a fanatical warmonger entering the oval office. Frank Sinatra, who stars in "Candidate" and was good friends with Kennedy, also stared in 1954's "Suddenly", a very good film noir in which a group of men prepare to snipe the US president. Replace "Candidate's" goof-ball senator Iselin with "Bush", "assassination" with "9/11", "communists" with "terrorists", "martial law" with "emergency powers" and you've also basically got the 2001-2009 US Presidency. Iselin's cosying up to communists with the intention of ditching them later is itself always US policy: create or fund your rivals, and then turn them into boogeymen to justify wars. Recognising this, director Jonathan Demme released a remake of "The Manchurian Candidate" in 2004.Frankenheimer's direction throughout "Candidate" is customarily bombastic. His style is Orson Welles on cocaine, the director mixing a range of styles, techniques (chiaroscuro, wide angles, deep focus, expressionism, jump cuts, overlapping dialogue etc) and genres (war, noir, political thriller, melodrama, satire, Kafka, pseudo-documentary, black comedy, parody, horror, science fiction, action, art house, existential psychodrama, incestuous soap opera) and then leaving it up to the audience to make sense of the mess. The film's constant gear-shifting shouldn't work, but as the film is itself about discontinuity and disorientation, and as most of its characters are drugged, hypnotised, fanatical and on the brink of insanity, Frankenheimer's unstable aesthetic fits fine. The film reflects a kind of widespread ridiculousness.8/10 - Worth two viewings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manchurian Candidate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film far ahead of its time. Its themes of thought control, political assassination, and a multinational conspiracy were hardly common currency in the 1960's.Still probably one of the most shocking films ever.Sinatra is just flawless, probably his best role. What is really remarkable about the part is how vulnerable he could play the character of Marco.The real standout to me though is Laurence Harvey as the war hero son, Raymond Shaw.It is interesting to note all of the the little things that he does in each scene. For instance, in the first scene in which he appears, Shaw is repulsed by the prostitutes and GI's.The entire sequence revolves around Shaw's problems with women, and how much his mother (Angela Lansbury) has destroyed his personality.....Just who is this man? And what is left of him? As to my favorite scenes from the film? I'd probably have to start with the brain-washing scene. It is just something you just don't see much of. The whole 360 * shot around the room, is balls to the wall brilliance.I also really love the scene at the end of the film with Marco at the Convention Hall, trying to stop " a time bomb" as he puts it...Also the whole karate fight scene between Sinatra &amp; Henry Silva.However, the scene that still has me the most intrigued and puzzled is the sequence on the train between Sinatra &amp; Janet Leigh's character.During their weird, oblique conversation, they talk about US states, Columbus' football team, railroad lines, and her two names (Eugenie and her nickname Rosie) - are they speaking in cryptic code? Is Marco also brainwashed as a Manchurian pawn - and is good old innocent looking Rosie his controlling operative? Or is she just looking for a little loving? Hmmmm.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A unique theme, the brainwashing during the cold war period, makes this film exceptionally attractive and interesting, and also advanced as a film made in 1962. Realistic shots of nightmares two soldiers have are unprecedented and mysterious. The ending is unexpected, but beautiful. Laurence Harvey, who regretfully passed away only at 45, shows us an outstanding acting with his "eye powers," and Frank Sinatra proves that he is an eminent actor by his delicate performance. I also want to applaud Angela Lansbury. This film should be highlighted more in the world, and I myself will recommend it to all my friends who even do not see many movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Manchurian Candidate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the Korean War, the Soviets catch American soldiers, including Sergeant Raymond Shaw and Captain Bennett Marco, to Manchurian, in Communist China. There, the Communists implant false memories in the soldiers' minds to cover their capture, and to provide a subconscious trigger in the mind of Sergeant Shaw made by Dr. Yen. Brainwashed, the soldiers are released back to America, unaware of what they have been through. Raymond's unconscious actions are triggered by the Queen of Diamonds.I've seen the remake starring Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, and Meryl Streep. Although I'm quite fond of the up-to-date remake, I found this film quite compelling. The film starts off slow, at first, but when the ball gets rolling, the movie really does get a whole lot better. True, I saw the twists and turns coming, with an exception of the different ending. However, I was still in the edge of my seats waiting for the inevitable to happen. But, like I said, the ending was different, with one surprise after another. My jaw dropped when the credits rolled.I love conspiracy films. The plot made me feel paranoid, much like Sen. Joseph McCarthy and his "red scare" out lash. The film demonstrated the fear of outsiders by having Communists implant things to one's body, along with unknown people who could also be a Communist. "Don't trust anyone but yourself." I praise this film for the originality. Even though I liked the "name calling controlling your brain" change from the remake better, I still found the playing cards quite interesting. The film is also relevant today, especially since it has been connected to Kennedy's assassination. The black-and-white photography works quite well on building up tension.With that being said, there were a few things that bothered me with the film. First of all, the performances weren't quite strong as I hoped for. In fact, the only person that stood out from the cast was Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury. They play each other quite well with the hating mother-and-son relationship. Lansbury really deserved her Oscar nomination for her role, as well. She plays a fantastic villain. Frank Sinatra doesn't have much to do here, along with Janet Leigh, whom I hoped would be more involved with the plot, but, instead, turned out to be a filler role.There was also one scene that bothered me. A fighting scene between Sinatra and a Communist Russian/Chinese (couldn't tell) was quite laughable and a bit unnecessary. I'm sure it could've been choreographed better. But overall, with its few faults, I enjoyed this sophisticated, paranoid thriller. The film has some great surprises that will leave you stunned. Please watch this movie before you die.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Queen Of Diamonds Plays Simon Says</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For John Frankenheimer, 1962 was a banner year. First he directed All Fall Down, then Birdman Of Alcatraz, and finally The Manchurian Candidate. The Manchurian Candidate is a milestone film in American Cinema, and a film ahead of its time. When it was finally re-released in the late 80's, it was still fresh and memorable. An entire army patrol is kidnapped and brainwashed during the Korean War and then sent home to do who knows what. One of them grows suspicious about the shared nightmares the men have and sets out to find out. We spend the length of the film finding out. Humorist George Axelrod adapted the screenplay from Richard Condon's biting Cold War novel. The film is simultaneously farcical, frightening, funny, mysterious, political, and suspenseful. It also contains some elements of film noir.Frankenheimer's direction is sure, and the film utilizes a combination of locations, set pieces, and astonishing wide angle lens photography (by Lionel Lindon). Most incredible is the Orson Welles-like filming of the brainwashing sequence where soldiers think they're attending a garden party club lecture. While they are being brainwashed, the camera does a 360 degree pan and segues to the enemy perpetrators in seamless fashion. It happens so subtly that the viewer barely notices. There are several zoom shots to close ups used effectively also. The film contains several noir-like qualities: above average dialog, a femme fatale (Angela Lansbury), contrasts between light and shadows, editing that quickens the pace (Oscar-nominated Ferris Wheeler), loss of innocence (symbolized by the shootings of John McGiver and Leslie Parrish), psychological manipulation, and tough violence.Frank Sinatra is stunningly good as Bennett Marco in his second career role of a lifetime (the first was From Here To Eternity). Laurence Harvey is equally good as Raymond Shaw, the war hero who may not be a war hero. Janet Leigh is Rosie, the new girlfriend or is she only a girlfriend of Marco's? Angela Lansbury, who was Oscar-nominated, plays Raymond's mother and is one of the most terrifying villains in screen history. James Gregory is Senator Iselin, the Joseph McCarthy-like red baiter with no clue as to what he's doing but will stop at nothing to grab the spotlight. Leslie Parrish is Jocelyn Jordan, Senator Jordan's daughter whom Shaw once loved and now has returned to. John McGiver is Senator Jordan, a liberal politician representing the common sense balance missing with extremist politics. Henry Silva is Chunjin, a link to the nightmare that sets Marco off. Of course, the events which unfolded following the film's release have only added to its luster. **** of 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Making of the President 2000/2004</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was before its time in many ways and a great work of art. It was also prescient in the way it predicted that it is conceivable that America's enemies could do everything in their power to make sure the US people elect and keep electing as president a man who is the most likely to do irreparable harm to his country under the guise of the best intentions. Does this prospect chill you to the bone? If this sounds too far-fetched, just take half a minute to Google the words "manchurian candidate" and "George W. Bush" on the same line and see what comes up...To quote from one of those websites: "If enemies of the United States had gotten together a few years ago to devise a plan to damage America and undermine its global position ? diminish its power and credibility, drag it into a stubborn war, harm its relations with allies, create international financial disarray, run up huge deficits, create political openings for the Europeans and China to exploit and become equals in global economic matters, motivate terrorists, bring the U.S. image in the Middle East to its nadir, restrict civil liberties at home, and so forth ? they would have been hard-pressed to create a program that would be more effective than the Bush administration's policies on these issues of war, terrorism, and global economics have."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this film without any clue of what it was about, other than the foreknowledge that it's a well regarded film. In the end, I was a little disappointed with the film, as it's touted as a great film. The film I saw was a good film, but certainly lacked that little oomph necessary to take it to great.But there was a lot about it that I liked. The casting/acting continually surprised me throughout the film. The characters are all a little... angular, but despite that, the performances are quite good and one of the highlights of the film. Indeed, despite seeing his name boldly credited, I completely forgot that Frank Sinatra was playing the lead character in the film. The story itself is nice too, complete with a few twists to keep things interesting. I even liked the dialogue writing.But I don't feel like all the components were strong. In particular, I felt like the overall direction of the film was a little stale. I often felt like everything I was watching was set up in front of me, rather than flowing naturally. Okay, that's a little vague, but the directing choices, including framing, mis-en-scene and the editing just kept things seeming just a touch artificial. The story, I can tell, is trying to go for paranoia, but the because there is little that's hidden from the audience, it ends up being a drama until the end, where a little suspense comes in. But since the film mood is that of suspense, it's hard to say whether the film really managed to get the whole thing right.I certainly wasn't convinced and halfway through the movie, I started getting fairly bored. It's not that stuff doesn't happen, but that the drama wasn't fully there. And then I had to keep wondering whether or not Janet Leigh's character had any significance to the film, because she seems a little like an afterthought. I would've excised her character entirely from the story, since she has no impact on the main characters.But I did finish it and the few twists that the film has were interesting enough to keep me from giving up on the film. That and I was still impressed by the underlying story as well as the acting. I just wish it were all presented better. It's still good, despite my complaints, but after having seen it, I don't get why the film gets so much praise. 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AWESOME &amp; did see the light of day again before late '80s!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every time you read something about this film, you're told that it was shelved immediately after JFK's assassination, and was not seen again until a late 1980's (or was it the early '90s?) re-release. That simply is not true. I vividly remember around age 8 -- i.e. circa 1970 or so -- seeing the film on TV, or at least some of it. After Bobby Lembeck was shot, I pleaded with my mother to change the channel, and so she did and we watched something less scary to an 8-year old, like Petticoat Junction or whatever. I never forgot that scene, although I did not remember the name of the movie. Fast forward about 20 years, my boyfriend and I had gone to see the movie in downtown Phila., and THERE WAS THAT SCENE AGAIN. I couldn't believe it.In my opinion, this is one of the 100 or so best films ever made. John Frankenheimer was one of the two or three best directors working in the 1960's. They could not have chosen a better Raymond than Laurence Harvey -- if you read the original novel, you could well assume that the character is based on Laurence Harvey, who was known to be rather cold and condescending in real life. Sinatra does his best work here, Angela Lansbury is freaking brilliant, and Laurence Harvey is really should have received some sort of acting nomination -- while the character is cold-hearted prick on the surface, he also shows you flashes of the pain, and later horror, beneath. The camera work is awesome -- so many images here that will imprint on your brain forever. The script pulls no punches (L. B. Mayer, who venerated the American mother, must have been spinning in his grave) and is far more sophisticated than is common in American films of any era. This is one of those very rare movies that do not appear dated in any way, although it might have somewhat if shot in color. In the current political climate, it is VERY timely, and worth a look on that basis.The Manchurian Candidate is definitely disturbing -- intentionally so, but if you want to see something intelligent and provocative, and you've already seen American Beauty five times, you should really check this out. And if you're REALLY into disturbing, intelligent and provocative, have a look at the Frankenheimer film released four years after this one, Seconds.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Solid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not quite the quintessential classic its reputation suggests, but still pretty solid fare. Laurence Harvey is an army commander roundly disliked by his men until he saves their lives with on the battlefield of Korea. Or does he? Frank Sinatra is one soldier convinced that something's just not right about his memories of Harvey's heroics. So he sets out to uncover what may just be a brainwashing scandal designed to benefit Harvey's senator stepfather.There aren't many faults to be found in "The Manchurian Candidate" other than its overly slow pace at times (Harvey's flashback to his first meeting with ex-gal pal Leslie Parrish, for instance). Sinatra and Harvey are superb, and the storyline gets high marks for originality. Yet one comes away with the sense that it all could have been just a bit better. One thing for certain is that the Denzel Washington remake of 2004 certainly didn't succeed in that.* *Cast Note: John McGiver, who plays Senator Thomas Jordan, had quite a distinguished career in television. Among others, he appeared on "Bonanza," "The Lucy Show," "The Beverly Hillbillies," "The Fugitive" and "Gilligan's Island."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film that dared to be different (if you'll excuse my clich)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love old black and white movies. I don't know exactly what it is, but there's just something that draws me into them. Maybe its' the rather clichd dialogue, the trademark camera zooms or the unimaginative editing. Whatever I love about them, they never fail to give me a bit of B-movie fun. However, on the downside they rarely feel real. Even when dealing with working class characters, the stories are always imbued with a sense of haughtiness, of moral righteousness. The villains always get their just desserts, and of course the hero runs off with the girl into the sunset.But the Manchurian Candidate, the landmark political thriller is one of the most shocking, emotional and intelligent films I've seen in a long time. I don't know how it feels so real, but it does. The camera work is pretty by the numbers, and some of the supporting cast overact but there's just something that marks it out from the other rather more artificial films of the same time period.And for a political thriller it sure packs a punch. I've never been a fan of the action/adventure genre, but I love this film. The emotional core is Lawerence Harvey's exceptional performance as Raymond Shaw, a political chess-piece exploited by powers he can't control. Thanks to the wonderful screenplay we get a real insight into his hopes and dreams and as a result, Raymond is never a staple hero or a villain. He's a real human being, and this is what makes the film so exceptional.On top of that the movie has a very unhappy ending. At the time of course this was almost unheard of. Films had to end with the bad guys getting what they deserve, not with heroes having their lives ripped to shreds. I don't want to ruin the film's denouement, but trust me, it's anything but upbeat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other films are classics because of what they say, how they resolve a story, or how they make a viewer feel. "The Manchurian Candidate" is magnificent for what it leaves unsaid, how unresolved it is, and how confused it leaves its audience. Movies usually don't succeed leaving so many loose ends, but then there is no movie quite like "The Manchurian Candidate."During the Korean War, Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is awarded the Medal of Honor for leading a combat patrol to safety, killing an entire company of Chinese soldiers at the cost of two men. One of the surviving comrades, Bennett Marco, is haunted by a dream in which Shaw is made to strangle one of the lost soldiers in front of a ladies' garden club.Is it possible that Chinese and Russian Communists kidnapped the patrol and played with Shaw's mind? To what purpose? Might it have something to do with the fact Shaw's stepfather is Sen. John Iselin, the famous anti-communist witch-hunter?Though Harvey has the title role, Marco is the lead character, played by Frank Sinatra in the autumn of his Rat Pack period. It's a surprise seeing how seriously he takes the role of Marco, shedding his sharkskin cool for a twitchy persona of muttered comments and hooded stares. Early on, we see him visited by a commanding officer who notices all the books he has scattered around. Marco admits to reading them all, and as he explains how interested he is in banking, horse diseases, and the novels of Joyce Cary, his face just falls because, deep inside, he doesn't know why he's reading such a bizarre selection, and he's too burnt out to pretend.Sinatra is great not just because he plays against type but for the way he commands the screen at key moments the way only a handful of other stars ever could, none of whom would have been right for Marco. But he is only one piece in this magnificent jigsaw puzzle, which also includes Harvey as the cold, mechanical, yet lovably unlovable Shaw, Angela Lansbury as Shaw's domineering mother, James Gregory as the buffoonish, Lincoln-fixated Sen. Iselin, and Janet Leigh as a mysterious woman who is another one of those elements of the film that leaves people wondering.Someone else who deserves to be singled out is Khigh Dhiegh as Chinese Communist control agent Dr. Yen, the one character in the film except for Sen. Iselin who seems to be able to laugh, even though his mirth comes with a body count. "With humor, comrade, always with a little humor," he urges a Russian colleague while plotting the use of their joint "mechanism."Is "Manchurian Candidate" anti-communist, or anti-anti-communist? Iselin's McCarthyistic behavior is a source of brilliant satire, but the communist menace in this film is not only very real, but bigger than life. The Soviet Union was on famously bad terms with Red China, yet here they get along fine. It presents a deeper sort of paranoia, but perhaps it is meant as satire of the whole Red Menace thing.You don't know what you are to think, because director John Frankenheimer and screenwriter George Axelrod never tell you. Taking their cue from Hitchcock and other pioneer auteurs (during his "hydrangea symposium," Dr. Yen references a 1941 work by someone named Welles), Frankenheimer and Axelrod throw red herrings at you from all directions, and enmesh you so deeply in a life-or-death mystery you need to watch it a second time just to pick up on how funny it all is.Add to that the dissonant score of David Amram and some very clever camera-work (the cleverest being a real-life mistake when Sinatra was filmed in a crucial scene with Harvey out-of-focus, thus lending a perfect touch of ambiguity to one of Sinatra's best moments on film), not to mention four or five hundred other things, and you have a movie classic, one that works both for the casual viewer and the film buff. Other films may try to play with your mind, but "The Manchurian Candidate" really does, in a way that leaves you grateful for the treatment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite a risky movie. Many viewers of today with their short attention spans will probably not fully understand it and that is because this movie respects the audience's intelligence as great movies should. But you don't need to look too deeply into this movie to see who the good guys are and the bad guys to enjoy it thanks to John Frankenheimer, a great action director, for making the visual cues of the movie so easy to follow. Plot: a patrol during the Korean War is captured by the Korean communists and brainwashed to take over the American Presidency by one of them, who happens to be the Vice President candidate's son, assassinating the other candidate to ensure they win the election. And although, the ball busting wife of the vice president made the deal to happen to try to have communism take over, she did not know they were going to use her son to be the assassinator, even though he is probably the best shot of the squad. Meanwhile, the other men in the patrol each of the same recurring dream nightly about the three days they were brainwashed, and that is because men were murdered during the brainwashing to prove it worked. Frank Sinatra plays the smarter of the patrol (apparently, the brainwashing doesn't go deep enough for some) and gets an investigation going with the help of another smart member who identify the same photos of a Korean Diplomat that applied the brainwashing. This leads the saving of the candidate but many others are in danger of the assassin and aren't so lucky. Look for Psycho co-star Janet Leigh who becomes Frank Sinatra's bride very abruptly with some odd conversations.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>War is hell, but sometimes the horror doesn't start until you come back home. The psychological horrors of war is the setup to the 1962 version of The Manchurian Candidate. A platoon of Korean veterans come home after being being detained in China, seemingly under the heroics of Staff Sergent Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey). The circumstances that surrounded the entire affair seem askew, and takes on a greater strangeness when everyone in the platoon has nightmares about a New Jersey Botany club becoming a brainwashing session lead by Communist Chinese. Captain Bennett Marco, played by Frank Sinatra in a surprising convincing role, was in the platoon, had the same nightmares, and is leading the investigation into the matter. What propels the movie, however, is the Cold War paranoia that is exploited by those who turn out to be the masterminds of the plot. The movie also features Angela Lansbury as Shaw's overbearing mother who remarried to a Republican Senator who has Presidential aspirations, Senator John Iselin, played in McCarthyian brilliance by James Gregory. One of the funniest lines of the movie is banter between Senator Iselin and a reporter over the number of Communist supporters there were in the Department of Defence. There are clues throughout the movie to the conclusion, but the ending is so well done, it is still a surprise, and an exercise in suspense. The final scenes occur at the Republican Convention at the old Madison Square Garden, and director John Frankenheimer finds a way to portray the chaos of the convention versus the impending danger that is posed by a mindless zombie, under the control of brain washers wanting to take over the US government. The film also features Janet Leigh, after her untimely death in the shower at the Bates Motel, as Sinatra's lover interest, but if you listen to her dialog closely, questions arise over her role in the entire movie. This movie not only plays as a Cold War paranoia film, but also a political thriller, with as much behind-the-scenes politicking as there are sinister plots.</fullReview>

She plays her husband Johnny (James Gregory) like a Kentucky fiddle and we the audience relish every second of it. Gregory is supremely inept as a U.S. Senator. Lawrence Harvey is stunning as the perfectly hollow Raymond Shaw. Only at the end when reality closes in on him do we see the true Shaw. His remedy is final, complete, and shockingly satisfying. And we get left with the post-remedy shell. Empty, lonely, solemn. Precisely what Frankenheimer had in mind. This is truly a film that may strive to become outdated, but will never make it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This really, really is a first rate film in every respect. It's great not just as an A1 political thriller but as a reminder of what a genuinely good actor Frank Sinatra could be-and how white-hot Laurence Harvey was in his day, sort of a Jude Law for the late 50s/early 60s.The plot is quite simple, however the storytelling and dialogue is occasionally a challenge, but one you want to get your teeth into: In the Korean War, a US platoon is kidnapped by the Chinese and the Russians. They are brainwashed, and returned home. Raymond Shaw (Harvey), the leader of the pack, returns to a hero's welcome and his overbearing mother, who in turn is now married to an obnoxious senator. Ben Marco (Sinatra), one of Shaw's men, is plagued by terrifying nightmares though, ones that could unlock murders, treason and a massive political plot. It's top class, full of twists and turns.Janet Leigh and Angela Lansbury are awesome too. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A masterfully done Cold War thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was way ahead of its time. The characters are richly played by a fine cast ... the plot full of twists and turns, the cinematography brilliantly executed ... it deserves classic status. One of the Top 100 films of all times IMHO. Frank Sinatra plays Capt./Maj. Bennett Marco with distinction. Laurence Harvey gives SSgt. Raymond Shaw believability and considering the depth and emotional range of his character that is truly an achievement. I cannot help but see Angela Lansbury (Mrs. Iselin) and John McGiver (Sen. Thomas Jordan), who hate one another in this movie, in their more familiar Disney roles ... but in retrospect I am not sure they ever played in another movie together? Both play their parts well in this flick about brainwashing and the evils of communism in the fifties and sixties. At any rate The (1962 Version) Manchurian Candidate is full of people conquering their inserted demons through friendships and strong wills. It will be very difficult for the remake to match the original's groundbreaking success. A real surprise ending awaits those who watch. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie, limited by the period in which it was made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall this is an excellent movie. A movie that has obviously formed a seed idea for many to follow. To the best of my knowledge this was one of the first (if not the first) to deal with the topic of a "sleeper agent", a concept that was visited again in the film Telefon (Charles Bronson) and a myriad of others.This was an daring book to consider making into a film at the time. Given the political climate at the time, it could very well have been halted before it began. Allegedly, Frank Sinatra made an appeal to his friend President Kennedy to give his blessing on the film when the studio started to get a little nervous about it.That said, the film was still limited by movie production of the time. The political themes are an obvious element that comes to mind, and towards the end of the film there is a very slight implication of an incestuous relationship between Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury's characters. This (according to an interview with Frank Sinatra that appears on the Australia DVD release of the film) is something explored to greater detail in the book but for obvious reasons couldn't be presented to a 1962 theatre audience.Currently there is a remake schedule for release later this year. This is something that may benefit the story with current productions being allowed to explore the political and personal themes that were presented in the original book (however I will reserve judgement on that until I see the film - could go entirely the opposite direction as well!)Recommended viewing ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1962 political and psychological thriller dealing with brainwashing and assassination generally tends to appear on most 'Top 100 Movies of All Time' lists. Frank Sinatra is decent as always, but it's Laurence Harvey as the brainwashed sleeper agent who is the highlight of the movie.It features some great performances and memorable sequences, and ultimately it's an important film because of the sensitive issues that it deals with. It's always been a controversial film, banned in all of the 'Iron Curtain' countries and even taken out of circulation in America after John Kennedy's assassination -- on Sinatra's own wishes. This is easily John Frankenheimer's best film. And as if it had somehow cursed him, when in 1968 he drove his friend Robert Kennedy to the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles, the senator was assassinated there that same day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Is there any director who is more underrated than John Frankenheimer? This movie, like so many of his efforts, has hardly aged a day (hence, there's no need for the upcoming remake!). In the case of Hitchcock's masterpieces, viewers usually have to overlook some cheesy elements; they smack of being brilliant historical relics instead of brilliant modern films. But Frankenheimer's crisp black-and-white photography and comparatively straightforward style stand up to the test of time rather better.As for plots - well, Hitch usually stuck to typical spies-and-murderers stuff, but "The Manchurian Candidate" aims considerably higher. Other comments on this site delve into the political satire in depth, and I won't repeat that kind of commentary here; I'll just say that it's very bold, very unique, and very topical at the moment.Sure, Frankenheimer spun some duds in his time, but on the whole his output was great; it's a shame that this film was banned for so long, and his reputation suffered as a result. It's also a shame that, when he was finally dusted off for another shot, he got stuck with lousy material like "Ronin." What a loss...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and disturbing look at the paranoia inherent in Cold War</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SpoilersJohn Frankenheimer's greatest film, "The Manchurian Candidate", is one of those rare political dramas that is still relevant after its release date-which, for this film, would be about 40 years ago. This film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, an arrogant and obnoxious army officer who is brainwashed, along with all of his platoon, by Communist higher-ups on an overseas mission. When he returns to the United States, it is revealed that he is the key to an intricate assassination plot that involves his monstrous mother and her odious husband (Raymond's father in law), a senator with deadly ambition. What these schemers never factored in was Bennet Marco, a member of Shaw's platoon who has managed to fight through the brainwashing and is forced to stop this insane plot that will put a Communist pawn in the White House. This is one of the films, along with "Chinatown", that defines the genre of "thriller". Suspenseful and shocking, "The Manchurian Candidate" plays off the era's anti-Communist hysteria, and although the Cold War is long over, it still stands as a powerful representation of a nation's fear of outsiders and the dread of the effect these outsiders would have on our moral, economic, and political beliefs. But more than that even it is a character study of two men who couldn't be more different but are thrust into this terrible situation by forces beyond their control. Raymond Shaw has been cruelly manipulated by the controls the Communists have over him-but his character is already tragically warped by his mother's hostility and coldness. Marco is an ordinary man who takes on a huge quest all by himself, and his final speech at the end of the film provides the perfect closing note. The three principle actors are at their best in this film. Sinatra showed that he could act in "From Here to Eternity", but here he is given the starring role and he shows how well he is able to carry a movie. He gives Marco layers beyond "the hero", he shows him as a man who was never close to Raymond Shaw-in fact, he doesn't even like the guy-but is willing to put that aside to help a tortured man and, in effect, save his country. Lawrence Harvey was the only person they could have cast as Shaw, a humorless dirge of a man without any real redeeming qualities. He is not a likable person, but that is because he has been so utterly damaged by his mother's "care" that he is not able to feel cheer. His only hope at happiness, Jocelyn Jordan (Leslie Parrish), is destroyed by the control of the Koreans and the Queen of Diamonds (more on that later). The famous scene, where Sinatra destroys the "links" in Shaw's head using the Queen of Diamonds-the visual clue that jumpstarts the links-is an acting lesson in itself. Harvey, who doesn't say a word for most of the scene, is able to convey mountains of emotions through his face and eyes. When Marco asks him "Who killed Jocelyn Jordan and her father?", you see realization and utter pain and dismay in Shaw's eyes before Marco washes the horrible truth away by saying "Forget that, forget all of that." It is truly a beautiful moment-or is it? Is Marco truly destroying the links, or is he just re-brainwashing the links out of Shaw's head? This is a question that rarely is asked when the film in discussed, but in it lies the true center of the movie. Angela Lansbury is magnificent as Mrs. Iselin, who is at heart a psychotic control freak and is using her son to become the ultimate controller-the person who runs the most powerful nation in the world. Lansbury, who we all know from "Murder, She Wrote", performs brilliantly as one of the greatest villains of all time. But, she too is not a one-dimensional character. In a short but essential speech, Mrs. Iselin reveals that she never knew her son would be the one who was brainwashed. Lansbury delivers the most heartbreaking line in the film-"in a world full of killers they picked you"-which reveals that she is, in fact, capable of human connection and feeling. That she actually did love her son is a fact that makes the ending even more shocking and tragic. A film with multiple brilliant ideas, images, and characters, "The Manchurian Candidate" will remain an essential film-a political parable with a human heart and conscience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film shortly after it was rereleased in 1988, and it blew me away. I'd never seen anything like it, and I still haven't 14 years later. While it must have seemed a bit over the top when it was made, it is frighteningly realistic today.I really believe that the less you know about this movie before watching it, the more you'll like it so I'll stay mum about the plot. What I will commend, though, are the performances by Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury, and Frank Sinatra. Harvey spends most of the movie in a trance-like state, and he is so convincing that it's almost unnerving. Lansbury plays a villainess with obvious relish, and it's got to be one of the all time b*tch roles of them all. As for Sinatra, he won an Oscar for From Here To Eternity, but I like him much more in this film. Even he has stated that this is the finest film with which he was associated.This movie is pretty high on both imdb's and AFI's list of top movies. Find out for yourself why!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite simply the best suspense-thriller in film history. The stellar cast includes Frank Sinatra, Laurence Harvey, Angela Lansbury and Janet Leigh, in this frank portrayal of what actually goes on in Cold War politics... and current politics, for that matter, when you consider how much the mass media brainwashes its citizens into thinking that war is necessary in the name of peace, etc. Granted, 'Manchurian's' corny plot contrivances--and its stock use of advanced hypnotism, enabling the commies in taking over the United States--still leaves something to be desired. Nevertheless, "The Manchurian Candidate" is a winning entry, and should be viewed with utmost discretion. By the way, did you memorize the heroine's phone number. You don't have to be a genius to learn it... and by the end of this picture, you too might be driven to commiting "un-patriotic" acts of civic duty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Everyone should know the plot to this by now so let me explain how I happened to see it and my reactions at the time. I think that may provide you with a rather fitting review.I was 17 and a friend and I used my car to double date to a drive-in movie double feature. The first show was "Bye-Bye Birdie" and at 'halftime' my friend and I went to the concession stand to get some popcorn and cokes.Well, the line was rather long and the second feature started while we were waiting. It had a rather hypnotic beginning and we began to watch it from the concession stand and were a little late returning to the car.Our dates were somewhat upset by our tardiness but noticed a rather abrupt change in our demeanors and began to watch the film too.Suffice it to say that none of us had the same interests that we had during the first feature.The theme is a little dated now but Frank Sinatra gave a great performance. Angela Lansbury and James Gregory reeked of so much evil that it took me over 10 years to forgive them and even Laurence Harvey was believable.Just an absolutely excellent film that is truly more frightening than "The Exorcist" or anything in that genre.****** 6 stars out of 6.

		<shortDescription>This is "the whole magilla"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The renowned and gifted John Frankenheimer was a busy man in 1962. He directed All Fall Down, then Birdman of Alcatraz, and finally, The Manchurian Candidate. The Manchurian Candidate is as involving and moving as was Birdman, and it has it all - incest, love and beautiful people, cold blooded killing, psychological terror, political intrigue, war, pharmaceuticals, and the interest of President John Kennedy before it was finished. Kennedy was assassinated not long after which gave the film a macabre insight that it didn't deserve. I hesitate to speculate on the influence or relationship the film had with Kennedy's assassination or its part in the psychedelic 60's. Far more informed than I have commented on both Kennedy's assassination and the psychedelic 60's and in great depth. The film was ahead of its time in that it broached the taboo subject of incest, mind altering substances, invasive hypnosis, and the use of psychiatry in warfare. These treatments are so subtle and convincing that the film will surprise if not shock any viewer who sees it cold and for the first time. There are gaping holes in the plot that leave serious questions unanswered, but the film works in spite of these holes and actually benefits from them.The plot unfolds slowly and cryptically while the film roars along at a breathtaking pace. There is no relief from tension anywhere along the way; even the love interests are cloaked in anxiety hatred and regret.A film classic so effectively directed that it still causes one to shiver in loathing at the characters and their behavior. Do yourself a favor and see this film.A note to parents - I advise parents to keep this film out of reach of young and older sensitive viewers. The subject matter is ugly by nature, and there is a serious mistake of medicine in the film that needs to be dealt with tactfully in more impressionable viewers. Hypnosis has been demystified since this film and is seen now as a harmless mostly ineffective medical tool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major Bennett Marco leads his troops into Korea, and are all betrayed by their guide and captured by the Communists. While being captured the entire platoon is brainwashed, and one of the members, Sergeant Raymond Shaw is programmed into an assassin. When the troop arrives back in the US, Shaw is decorated with the Medal of Honor, but somehow Marco can't shake off the feeling that there is something wrong is going on around here, due to his nightmares about his brainwashing. Meanwhile, Shaw's stepfather, Senator John Islen, accuses the defense department of being infiltrated with Communists ( ala Sen. McCarthy ). Marco later believes that the Islen attacks are tied in with his uneasiness with Shaw, which all seem to stem from Islen's and Shaw's relationship with Shaw's mother. But can Marco stop the ultimate plan that Shaw was programmed for. Incredibly suspenseful and is full of gripping twists and turns, that will keep the viewer glued to their seat through the entire picture. Sinatra, Harvey, and Lansbury give some of the greatest performances ever witnessed on screen, and are backed by a stellar cast. ( I think Janet Leigh's role is somewhat wasted because I feel it is a bit insignifigant ). Great satire and attack of the McCarthy witch hunts of the 50's. Rating 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" is the most influential thriller of the past forty years, and arguably the greatest political thriller in cinematic history. The story unfolds in a unique and arresting fashion, keeping you involved from one plot-twist to the next. The stylistic uses of flashbacks and details allow the plot to develop in innovative ways, and Frankenheimer's direction keeps everything grounded in reality.Laurence Harvey's performance is as riveting as a performance can get. His character is always hiding something, whether it is from the battle where he was emotionally scarred, or his mother, who circles over him like a starved vulture. The thing that makes his character so intimidating is not how he affects other people or events, but how other people or events affect him. We have a lingering feeling that at some point Raymond Shaw is going to explode, but we don't know when.The most chilling aspect of the story isn't the actual horror or mayhem that is occurring on screen, but the fact that it all seems so REAL. The characters remain wholly believable throughout the film, and the underlying theme of political hypocrisy hasn't dated a minute. "The Manchurian Candidate" is every bit as effective now as it was in 1962.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unquestionably one of the greatest American films.The Manchurian Candidate never fails to thrill, horrify ,move, and amuse me.That last adjective was not a misprint..Candidate is a genuinely funny film,one of the most savage satires ever made.I don't simply refer to its assault on McCarthyism, or its subtly incestuous portrayal of "momism". There is much more going on in the film. The techniques used by the Communist brainwashers subtly parallel the mind-control techniques used by Madison Avenue. The completely misunderstood scene between Janet Leigh and Sinatra is, in fact a parody of the banal language of everyday life. John McGivers character is, in fact , parody of Adlai Stevenson( Even though in the film, it is hinted that he is a liberal Republican.), just as John Ickes Iselin is Joe McCarthy with the social standing and wealth of William Fife Knowland, ( In fact, "Big John Iselin" bears a a startling physical resemblance to "The Senator from Formosa"). This is a multilayered film of extraordinary artistry,with perfectly modulated performances by all the characters.Unquestionably, the peak of John Frankenheimers all too erratic art.</fullReview>

It's the perfect political thriller, with dastardly villains, Freudian conflicts galore, a party convention, satire, and a not unappreciable sense of humor amid the grim psychological horror. The thing I found weird was the Abraham Lincoln imagery. My guess is that back in '62 Lincoln was even more of a universal symbol of goodness than he is today, and that therefore it's supposed to be ironic, but who knows?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>in memory of Laurence Harvey, and Raymond Shaw</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Manchurian Candidate' came out in 1962, and was one of the most provocative and thought-provoking films mainstream Hollywood had produced up to that point. Before addressing the film itself, a few words about its co-star, Laurence Harvey. Harvey became a star at an awkward time in cinema history, the late fifties and early sixties, when so much of society and entertainment were in transition. He might be considered the last of a breed: the dashing leading man who was a mainstay in films of the thirties and forties but was rapidly becoming out-of-date. With his British accent (he was actually born in Lithuania) and matine-idol good looks, Laurence Harvey was ever the suave, debonair, well-spoken man of taste, equally adept at portraying a tragic figure or a heartless heel, and he played each type on several occasions. When he did play a hero, he did so with lan, never more so than in 'The Alamo,' where he was cast to perfection as Colonel William Travis. Without a doubt the best part of that film, Harvey's interpretation of Travis, with all the gallantry, conceit, and courage that it entailed, puts to shame the later one by Patrick Wilson. Harvey starred opposite Elizabeth Taylor in her Oscar-winning 'Butterfield 8,' and it is a testament to his abilities that he maintained his dignity even while spouting some of the worst dialogue imaginable. His career declined in the late sixties; one of his last performances was on an episode of Rod Serling's Night Gallery entitled 'The Caterpillar,' a memorably creepy tale. He died all too young at the age of 45. And 'The Manchurian Candidate' was certainly a high point in his career, as it was for the rest of its stars; Frank Sinatra, Janet Leigh, and Angela Lansbury.The plot concerns an American soldier, Raymond Shaw (Harvey), who is captured during the Korean War and programmed via brainwashing to become an assassin. The other members of his platoon are brainwashed as well, but only to forget what happened, their memories replaced with one of Shaw bravely rescuing them singlehandedly, which leads to Shaw becoming a Medal of Honor winner and national hero. His mother (Angela Lansbury) is married to a U.S. Senator whom she controls completely, just as she has always manipulated Raymond's life. Eventually, we learn that she is in league with Shaw's communist controllers, and the plan is for Shaw to assassinate a presidential nominee, thus propelling her husband to the top spot and ultimately the presidency itself. The film is audacious in suggesting that it is a right wing political operative who collaborates with the Chinese and Russian communists, though Angela Lansbury's character almost certainly uses that political affiliation precisely because it provides the perfect cover. She is a pure monster, and Lansbury's smooth, reasonable manner makes her deviousness even creepier. Frank Sinatra plays Ben Marco, Shaw's commanding officer in Korea and the one who eventually unravels the mystery. It's easy to forget that Sinatra could be a very fine actor on occasion, and this is surely the best movie he ever appeared in. He underplays the role effectively, and much of his time on screen is spent listening to or reacting to other characters. Janet Leigh's character Rosie is somewhat mysterious; she and Marco get married (after what seems about a half-hour courtship) and they have a couple of very strange conversations that critics to this day are at odds to explain; one can't help wonder what the purpose of Rosie's character really is. But it is Laurence Harvey who is the focal point of the film and his character is the glue that holds the disparate elements together. I mentioned the tragic characters Harvey became known for portraying, and there certainly was none more tragic than Raymond Shaw. There is an irony in that he was a man who was tortured inside before he was ever brainwashed; by the end of the film, he has been run through the ringer so many times, by so many different people, he is all but hollowed out. And yet from somewhere deep within himself, Shaw finds just enough strength of purpose left to do the right thing; for once in his life, to set a great wrong right, by killing the corrupt senator instead of the nominee, and his mother. Then he puts on his Medal of Honor and kills himself. Marco remembers him and eulogizes him as, "poor friendless, friendless Raymond."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" deals with cold war (it was on back then) and brain washing. It's a most interesting movie an it was a very original too back in the early 60's (in my opinion it still is).John Frankenheimer achieves a perfect political thriller full of intrigue and tension all along with moments of real impact. The initial sequences when the captured American soldiers are in a sort of fine ladies meeting that forth and back turns into a military auditorium are most creative; so are the cold blooded murders scenes and the final ones at the candidate's convention.Frank Sinatra was indeed a very talented man; a great singer indeed but also a first rate actor. He renders here a most accurate performance as the officer that discovers that something is very wrong. Though I never thought much about Laurence Harvey as an actor, he is correct here as the tortured war hero that is being used by his own mother. Janet Leigh is very good also as Sinatra's romantic interest (away from her usual costume and adventure damsel's roles of the 50's) and so are John McGiver and James Gregory. But in my opinion it is Angela Lansbury who steals the show with her remarkable performance as Harvey's dominating and mean mother; she's perfect all the way.The sequence of the fight between Sinatra and Henry Silva is a highlight too and even more if you notice they both use a sort of oriental martial arts style very appropriate for military trained men as both are (I think this must have been one of the first times in movies where martial arts appeared in a man against man fight)."The Manchurian Candidate" stands as a classic in its kind that certainly didn't need a remake as the recent one with Meryl Sreep and Denzel Washington, a definitely inferior product that perhaps would have come out as an acceptable picture if the original didn't exist. But it does exist and there's no possible comparison.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As much as I admire this film, I am always perplexed by the logic of the ending where Raymond walks unnoticed through the convention hall dressed as priest. He is the step-son of the Vice Presidential nominee. He is a Medal of Honor winner, and his mother and step-father have been basking in his reflected glory as a means to promote themselves politically. So....wouldn't he normally be expected to join them at the podium? Isn't he so famous that somebody might notice him walking around dressed as a priest? I mean, if the Bush twins showed up at a Republican convention dressed as nuns, don't you think somebody might notice a thing like that?? I guess it is a "suspend disbelief" moment, like when nobody recognizes that Clark Kent is Superman just because he wears glasses.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Staff Sgt Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) is a hated NCO during the Korean war, but on his return to America he is remembered fondly by all - including his commanding officer, Ben Marco (Frank Sinatra) - and he receives the Congressional Medal Of Honour. Despite the fact that his over-powering mother (Angela Lansbury) and her dim-wit, Senator husband (James Gregory) welcome this wonderful award, it doesn't stop Raymond turning into a thoroughly loathsome human being! Forget the remake (with it's very fine actors but so-so director) this film is AS GOOD AS THEY SAY. OK - the Janet Leigh character is ambiguous at best best and Sinatra is in sometimes emotionally above his depth... But what a film for 1962! And what a well made - extremely well made - thriller for any year. And as for criticism about Senator Iselin being too dumb for office... Hellooooooo!!!! This is a fine, fine movie. The scene when Iselin bullies the press conference; the first karate scrap in Hollywood; the 'rigged' queen of diamonds pack de-brief; the finale (the lifting of the candidates' flag itself is a film student's lesson scene!) - all filmed with great skill and imagination. I'm still not sure whether Janet Leigh's immediately friendly femme is Communist fatale or not. But I'm happy to believe she was there to 'de-brief' Major Marco when the dirty deed was done.And the acting? Sinatra is solid and sometimes inspired. Harvey is as stiff as a fresher in the netball team's showers - which is uncannily perfect for the role. And even when I ask myself: Why the English public school accent? A voice keeps crying: 'Fill me burgers and make clean'; whatever that might mean. And James Gregory is exquisite comic relief.But enough of that. Angela Lansbury is very good throughout the film but, in her final 'Lady Macbeth' speech, she gives as fine a performance in a single film scene as any actress has given. It's now probably (sadly) best remembered for the fact that mother snogs son - but the speech that precedes this Oedipal (or should that be, Jocasta) lust, in which Mrs Iselin declares how great she is about to become (with her son's active acquiescence) and how that greatness will undermine those who have abused her familial ties so gravely, is as perfect an example of the acting art as you will see in a motion picture: 'Then Johnny will really hit those microphones and those cameras, with blood all over him, fighting off anyone who tries to help him, defending America even if it means his own death! Rallying a nation of television viewers into hysteria to sweep us up into the White House with powers that will make martial law seem like anarchy!' George Axelrod - you just wrote Shakespeare! Or you just let slip the dogs of war... Congratulations.The Manchurian Candidate is about neither being right (Communism and Capitalism that is) and, inevitably, about both being wrong. That it did not have the answer to the '3rd way' is greatly to it's credit. That it's a stunningly shot, finely acted and frequently sublimely written film is greatly to our good fortune.I think Mr Frankenheimer has smelt foul deeds above the earth - with carrion men groaning for burial...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seminal Sixties Brainwashing Political Assassination Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An American platoon are captured by communist powers in Korea and brainwashed into forgetting everything, while one of their number is trained to be an assassin. Back in the US, the killer is prepped by his control agent, who also happens to be his mother, to assassinate a presidential candidate.Based on a novel by Richard Condon, this is a terrific story which works as an exciting thriller, a political satire and a weird kind of domestic drama. There are other movies about brainwashing (Split Image is my favourite), but this is the original and it uses the idea to mess with your head wonderfully well - scenes are presented from multiple points of view, characters talk in strangely stylised ways which may be secret code or may just be the way they talk, and you're never really sure of anyone's motivation. The cast are an odd but intriguing bunch - Harvey is perfectly dislikeable as the unlovable puppet, Sinatra gives probably the best straight acting job of his career, Lansbury is simply terrifying as Harvey's power-mad manipulative mother (although she's way too young), Leigh is divinely beautiful and extraordinarily enigmatic, and a very young Silva has a great bit as a pesky commie agent. Brilliantly directed, the film is a very witty contradiction - it eviscerates the myopia of the gung-ho Republican right within a story about a communist plot to infiltrate a wealthy American political dynasty !! Made the year before, much has been made of the film's link to the JFK assassination (a weak-minded loner with leftist links stakes out a rally to shoot a presidential candidate with a rifle), and this does give it an eerie quality. One of the best and most influential political conspiracy thrillers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something Old, Something Blue (Eyes, that is): The Manchurian Candidate, 1962</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>America, 1962- There was no War on Terror, but there was a Cold War; there had been no Gulf War, but there had been a Korean War; there was no Axis of Evil, but there was an Iron Curtain. There was, however, The Manchurian Candidate; this one did not star Denzel Washington as the suspicious and troubled Captain Bennett Marco, or Liev Schreiber as the more greatly troubled and rather cold Sgt. Raymond Shaw. The 1962 version sported Frank Sinatra (yes, Old Blue Eyes, although the fact is not readily apparent because this was in black and white) and Laurence Harvey in the respective Washington and Schreiber roles. John Frankenheimer's classic has always seemed to me less of a thriller than a criticism, but what I believe raises it above an instance of political lecturing is how good a story it is independently of its "message." The premise does not promise much: several men on patrol in the final days of the Korean War are ambushed and disappear. Upon their re-appearance, it appears that the young and generally disliked Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey) has led his comrades to safety with commendable courage; he is in fact commended, and promptly receives the Medal of Honor. His stepfather, Senator Islen (James Gregory), and the eminence grise behind his congressional career, Shaw's mother (portrayed by a young Angela Lansbury, of Murder, She Wrote fame), are quick to take advantage of Raymond's hero status, and begin a push for a vice president nomination for the senator. Meanwhile, Shaw's commander, Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and several other members of the ill-fated patrol begin having troubling dreams conflicting with the official account of Shaw's bravery. More of the plot, I will not comment on, not so much to keep the secret, but to not appear redundant; most of television viewing population will have learned the secret from the previews for the 2004 version. I will focus instead on the performances: Frank Sinatra is greatly effective in what many believe to have been his best role. As Bennett Marco, he is our link to the events, as confused as we are, depressed by the horrors of war, but optimistic; he befriends Raymond, serves as his watcher, and hopes he can be re-habilitated. As he becomes more and more involved with the sinister intrigues swirling around Shaw, he draws us into them as well. He comes to care for this aloof and vulnerable young man, and Laurence Harvey portrays him with just the right hint of deep set psychological problems covered up with several layers of cynicism and hatred. And once we encounter his mother, portrayed by Angela Lansbury as a truly creepy and manipulative woman, we can understand the depths of those psychological problems. There are also several delectably subtle touches throughout the film; one of my favorites is the obvious idolatry of Senator Islen for Abraham Lincoln. There is also a moment later on in the film between Shaw and Marco, were the confused state of Shaw's mind seems to be reflected by the blurriness of the photography; this was, apparently, unintentional, but could easily join several of the other instances of the cinematography reflecting the state of the character's minds, as the film is chocked full of shadows and strange camera angles. So what about that "message"? Why is this film regarded as a political satire as well as a political thriller? Is it pro or anti-communism? I've seen the 1962 version a couple of times, and I've never really seen any evidence of it promoting one political ideology over another; I think what it really criticizes, what it is really against, is politicians using people's fear as a cudgel to bludgeon their freedom, and people's patriotism to foment their own political agenda. Like the 2004 version, its criticism seems to fall equally on both sides of the aisle; unlike the 2004 version, it shows the weakness of the alleged "enemy" both sides provide, which is why, I think, it remains relevant, while the social commentary of the newer version, for all its slick cinematography, will date it to 2004.</fullReview>

I believe it was withdrawn from distribution soon after the events of 22 November 1963 due to it's close proximity with 'Political Assassination'.

The sequences when the Laurence Harvey character begins assassinating kinfolk are deeply heartbreaking to watch. This is the kind of Film you wake up in a cold-sweat with!!!!.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Often imitated but never equaled, the undisputed champion of paranoid political thrillers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there the least doubt that John Frankenheimer's The Manchurian Candidate remains the nerviest, most flamboyant political thriller ever made in America? It came like a blast of thawing warmth after the chilly caution of the Cold War years, when political 'thrillers' were either the dour and dutiful lectures of the anti-Communist cycle, or so heavily coded they were uncontroversial (Invasion of the Body Snatchers). The Manchurian Candidate takes the conventions of the Red Scare movies and stands them on their head ? or kicks them right up into the lunar orbit of what Richard Hofstadter termed the paranoid style in American politics. It opens, in flashback, in the dreary trenches of Korea, where a U.S. officer (Lawrence Harvey) would garner a Purple Heart for rescuing most of his platoon from an enemy attack. But back in the States, recurring nightmares plague the survivors. In them, the matronly members of a ladies' garden club, all print dresses and brash millinery, melt into a sinister praesidium of Russian and Chinese functionaries demonstrating the success of their newly developed brain-washing techniques. (The circling camera-work is virtuosic, and when an African-American veteran experiences the same dream, the club women are all black.) Army intelligence officer Frank Sinatra is one of the dream's victims, and so incapacitated by it that he's been demoted to public-relations work.That work takes him into the Senate hearing rooms where a drunken, buffoonish demagogue (James Gregory) strews accusations of Communist infiltration of the government. Though the press finds his charges inconsistent and erratic, they inflame the country (as his wife and power-behind-the-throne Angela Lansbury sensibly remarks, 'Are they asking 'Are there Communists in government?' No, they're asking 'How many Communists are there?'). As it happens, Harvey is Lansbury's son and Gregory's stepson, though he claims to abhor everything they stand for and, spurning the hero's welcome they've arranged, announces that he plans to work for a powerful liberal columnist in New York.Things happen fast. The columnist if founded murdered in his bed. Harvey falls in love (again) with Leslie Parrish, the daughter of one of Gregory's staunchest adversaries (John McGivern), who's trying to block Gregory's bid to be vice-presidential candidate. Sinatra meets up with a forward Janet Leigh (peripheral to the plot but, in a measuredly kooky performance, a welcome respite). And he finds that the Harvey he knew is no longer what he remembered ? or that what he remembers is not what actually happened. Those aforementioned things come to a head at one of the parties' (interestingly, it's never said which one) nominating convention at Madison Square Garden....The dizzy spiral of murders and reverses and revelations leaves the familiar fingerprints of novelist Richard Condon (and those fingerprints can be found in two more dazzling movies made from his work: Winter Kills and Prizzi's Honor). Screenwriter George Axelrod and Frankenheimer don't pull many of Condon's punches, either. And the cast they assembled to bring this wickedly entertaining yet frightening parable to life was stellar. Its Queen of Diamonds, however, is unquestionably Lansbury, in what must be acclaimed her most powerful appearance on film. With a steely gaze and a mouth puckered into a permanent hen's hole, she steals her scenes with bravado, as she schemes and manipulates and plays her global game of cards for keeps. She's the unforgettable centerpiece of an unforgettable movie.The Manchurian Candidate disappeared for decades. Sinatra had starred in two movies that dealt with presidential assassinations (the other being Suddenly) and he withdrew them from circulation following the death of John F. Kennedy (another story has it merely a dispute over rights). Released again in the late 1980s, The Manchurian Candidate reached audiences for which the turmoil of McCarthyism was but a distant memory (if they knew of it at all). But the appeal and the importance of The Manchurian Candidate apparently transcended the topical. In its wake came a nest of thrillers that raised questions about the benevolence of American power and those who wield it:: Frankenheimer's own Seven Days in May, The Parallax View, 3 Days of the Condor. But, even with the threat of a heavy-duty remake (to be released within days of this writing), The Manchurian Candidate holds on to its championship title ? and under all its outrageousness, for all its being tied to a particular era, it's still a dead serious piece of work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the greatest spy thrillers in the history of filmdom. The plot is so wild that it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end. Also, this is a very disturbing film due to the fact that a within the next year John F. Kennedy was assassinated and because of that, this film was rarely seen for some twenty five years after that. Another thing that makes it so disturbing is the fact that it talks about brain washing and what some governments would do to bring down our country.Besides the story, the cast itself was great. Frank Sinatra was perfect as Major Marco, as he is struggling to to remember the events of his past. Laurence Harvey is great as Raymond and puts in an especially disturbing performance. However, the one that really steals the show is Angela Lansbury. She played a role that was definitely a far cry from the sweet Jessica Fletcher that everyone grew to love her. This film will always be a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Manchurian Candidate" was a good idea for a movie but this filming was rather poor. Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury were good in their roles. The love affair between Frank Sinatra and Janet Leigh bordered on being farcical. Janet Leigh seemed to be there just for a pretty face. Her role and relationship with Sinatra made no sense. The middle of the movie drug on with many nonsensical scenes. The ending was predictable and I thought pretty clumsily done. Frank Sinatra's discovery of where Laurence Harvey was was ridiculous, not in the least believable. The beginning had promise and the brainwash and dream scenes were imaginatively done but the rest of the movie did not live up to a promising beginning. The filming wasn't bad but the screenplay was poor. Seemed to be a vehicle for Frank Sinatra but the real stars were Laurence Harvey and Angela Lansbury.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best movies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Manchurian Candidate is perhaps one of the greatest movies ever made. With stellar star cast like Angela Lansbury, Lawrence Harvey, Frank Sinatra, and Janet Leigh, you can't go wrong or beat them. THe script is brilliant and the film overall is suspenseful with twists and turns that you can't miss a beat or get lost. In the end, you keep wanting more. Except for Angela Lansbury, the rest of the cast has gone away. I wished Angela would become Dame Angela Lansbury. Her performance as incestuous mother is both chilling and creepy. Who would have thought that the same woman from Murder, She Wrote? would play such a role. Angela is fantastic and she be honored for a lifetime of work. I can't forget Janet Leigh who was another remarkable lady of the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some films are important less for their merit and more for the reaction they illicit. "Platoon" is my favorite example of this. To read the reviews of "Manchurian Candidate" on this data base you would think Orson Wells and Richard Condon never existed. While a bold effort by John Frankenheimer in his staging and shooting of the dream/hallucination sequences, he owed much to Wells for many of the slanted angles he employed. Further, George Axlerod dropped the ball at several key points in his adaption of Condon's original work, creating completely ludicrous character jumps for Bennet Marco &amp; Rosie Chaney. Even so, the "Manchurian Candidate" stood out for many as a political thriller that allowed them to see the fluidity of political rhetoric. For some, this created a discerning eye that could see when the manipulators were domestic as well as foreign. Frankenheimer's best work ("Seven Days in May") was yet to arrive, but Candidate surely made that film possible. From a cinematic point of view, Candidate should be remembered simply as tour de force for Angela Landsbury and Laurence Harvey, yet we all know that the determination of a film's legacy goes way beyond its technical merit. Thus, Candidate holds water today despite its mediocre craftsmanship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just finished watching this movie for the umpteenth time and noticed something that I've never spotted before. In the scene in Madison Square garden, when Laurence Harvey, who is dressed as a priest, is passing by the stage, the camera pulls back for a wider shot of the stage. As the camera pulls back, a state placard comes into view, just as Harvey "the assassin" walks by it, carrying the case with the rifle. No other placards are in that shot, just the one that Harvey passes. When you look at the placard, it turns out to be from Massachusetts, the home state of John F. Kennedy.

		<fullReview>Superb cold war drama. **POSSIBLE Spoilers** Laurence Harvey and friends have been brainwashed, and he's been trained to be an assassin. That's only a starting point of a very dark, disturbing but spellbinding motion picture. Harvey is very good as a brainwashed killer and even Sinatra (who I never liked) is pretty good. But Angela Landsbury is beyond belief. She is letter perfect as a cold, calculating, cruel woman. If you've just seen her in the "Murder She Wrote" TV series, you're in for a big surprise. She was nominated for an Oscar for this film--too bad she didn't win. Great direction--again and again I was astounded by the shots Frankenheimer pulled off. Only one minor complaint--what was Janet Leigh doing in the movie? Nothing against her, but there's no reason for her to be here. Other than that, the film is flawless. See it--you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Axelrod is/was a hack writer, although it benefits the viewer in this instance. Pressed for time he takes large bits of the book and converts them word for word to the screenplay. Had he tried to add his own words, he would have murdered the work. Frankenheimer is the king of claustrophobic camera-work, it is tight and circling. Every once in a while he sets up a perfect David Lynch frame, and he uses silence well. Lawrence Harvey is superb, seething with the embedded venom of a seriously dysfunctional childhood. Sinatra plays one of the coolest heroes ever, and therefore his mediocre performance seems well-done. With the exception of Sinatra the acting is all around decent, and I must say, watch the movie, then read the book. If you read the book first it will ruin your opinion of the movie, as the book is inevitably better than film. However, if you watch the movie first, you will have these amazing Frankenheimer images in your skull that carom off the deeper plot information in the book. Then it will all come together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't know who put the cast together, but especially after watching an interview including Frank Sinatra on the DVD I watched got the feeling that because who Frankie was he made the choice of what character to play. Harvey and Landsbury were definitely at their best. Sinatra was the king and there's no doubt about his royalty in music and had other connections, too. Got the feeling the director just didn't feel too comfortable in saying, "Hey Frank, that sucked. We'll give this scene it's twelfth take and try to get it right this time.". You just didn't do that to Frankie, but should have. Weak acting. I know the film was redone I believe in 2002 and I look forward to seeing if the part Sinatra played is done better this time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may not be as relevant as the remake but it is well rounded, delivering tension, satire, characters and a generally great film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When his unit is tricked and trapped during the Korean War, Capt Bennett Marco and his men are rescued with the amazing heroics of the very well-liked and respected Sergeant Raymond Shaw. On his return to America Shaw becomes one of the few men to be awarded the Congressional Medal Of Honour for his actions. Years pass but yet Marco cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong ? he remembers being in a hotel lobby during a lecture on flower arranging but in his dreams the old women become Chinese military men. When he finds that others have the same dreams he works with military intelligence to uncover their meaning. Meanwhile Shaw's mother uses him to help boost his stepfather's career in the Government, running on a hard line anti-communist ticket.Although the social and political setting is now one of history this film is still a very enjoyable film that serves as thriller, satire and paranoid conspiracy film. I will try and avoid comparisons but naturally the remake stands up better in front of a modern audience simply because it is able to use the more relevant 'big business' slant as well as presenting it as a much more consistent thriller than the original. However this film still stands up well but maybe is not as tense as it could have been because it does take a more balanced approach to the story by building around it as well. This may sound like a criticism but it is only a bad thing in regards a pure thriller, as a matter of fact it makes it a more rounded film. As a satire the film makes good mileage out of the witch hunts over Communism and the political manipulation associated with those who merely accused others with no thought or logic in a manner that swept up the public but also made others afraid to argue. This is well done but my fear is that it will continue to lose its impact as these times become longer ago ? sure the theme still works but the relevance is gone and it is not as involving as (sorry for the comparison) the same strand in the remake; understandably so however. The thriller aspect works well enough and is pretty tense but it is not consistent, instead it is kept for several key scenes and its cold, brutal nature is really impacting ? even if it is naturally dry and bloodless by today's standards. The fact that the film doesn't push the thriller aspect means that it is able to build across the board and plenty of interesting and satisfying aspects that are played down in the remake are stronger here.In particular the film develops the characters well, making more of the political side of things but also adding much needed meat to the characters of the Jordans, making us see their role in Shaw's life but also getting to know them as characters. This makes for a much more satisfying story, even if I personally preferred the more consistent paranoid and tense atmosphere of the remake. The original also brings out the complex relationship that Shaw has with his mother ? we are given more time with this and it is more interesting than the remake, which barely spares the time for it and makes do with a clumsily bit of suggested sexuality.The cast are all pretty good and indeed one of them was the reason I decided to rewatch this film. With Leigh just passing away yesterday, I decided to watch this film (well ? also because I had just watched the remake) and was surprised to find that she had so little time in this. Her character is barely used and could easily have been done away with and why such a well-known actress was put in such a minor role. Sinatra is pretty good in his role but I didn't totally buy his performance ? he should have been more scarred by what happened, and surely he should not have been believed as quickly as he was? Harvey is much better ? cold but with a real emotion underneath and his performance is the core of the film. In the acting stakes though, it is Lansbury that sticks in the memory as the domineering mother type, easily her best role. Gregory is great fun as the manipulated Iselin and Parrish and McGiver are both good as the Jordans. Dhiegh is good and provides a wonderful mix of comedy with the edge of cold menace.Overall this is a very good film that provides a well-rounded story delivering tension, thrills, laughs, shocking cold violence and a good serving of satire. Modern audiences may well find that the relevance of the remake makes it a more enjoyable film but the original is a much more rounded film that succeeds as more than just a thriller. It may not be as sharp as it once was but it is still really worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It turns out China really did send back "Manchurian Candidates" after the Korean War, but a less sophisticated kind than in the movie:http://www.koreanconfidential.com/manchuriancandidatesreport.htmlKorCon recently told you about a Top Secret program to monitor, and sometimes hold back, pro-communist letters from US POWs in Korea. U.S. intelligence secretly opened letters sent by U.S. POWs to their families. If the letters contained communist propaganda or suspected secret messages, they were not delivered.We ran across an interesting twist in those previously classified Pentagon records, which show the letter-opening project ran into at least one delicate situation. When intelligence officials opened two letters from a U.S. prisoner, they found that one was a letter to the man's wife and the second was a suggestive message to another women. But the letters had been put into the wrong envelopes.The intelligence officials didn't know whether the man had goofed or the communists were testing to see whether the mail was opened in the U.S. It's unclear whether the Pentagon sent the letters to their proper reciepients, or, more likely, kept their operation secret by allowing the embarrassing mistake to occur, leaving the prisoner with some tough questions to answer when he returned home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching "The Manchurian Candidate" doesn't feel at all like you are watching an old fashioned thriller. It's quite modern with its approach and story and definitely a movie that seemed to be decades ahead of its time.It's really a movie that gets made by its story. It by no means is an exciting movie action-wise, simply because there is more talking and set-up in this movie than anything else really but the movie itself manages to still become exciting nevertheless, all due to its well written and original story. It features lots of classic thriller themes in it and of course also takes advantage of the cold war scare that was very much alive among the people, during the '60's. It plays on some of the fears and paranoia aspects of that period. The actual story itself is actually being far from likely but yet it works out all within the movie, due to the way it all gets told by director John Frankenheimer and its wonderful cast.The movie also has plenty of surprises in it and chooses to tell its story slowly and reveal not too much about its main plot from the start on already but instead do so in a more slow but steady way. Step by step the movie its mystery gets revealed but not without adding in plenty of surprising twists as well, as well as its unforgettable awesome ending.It's a very serious movie, which actually does make the movie a realistic one, which in return enhances the movie its tension and other thriller aspects. In lots of ways this movie is being very similar, in its style and set-up, to political thrillers being made this present day.Frank Sinatra never was a person that impressed as an actor, not even with his Oscar winning performance for "From Here to Eternity" but I must say that he was being simply great within this movie. He's not being a typical or classic hero within this movie and he's actually being a very humane character, so also with all of its flaws. Laurence Harvey is also great and he plays the true main character of this movie, in my opinion. Also really fun to see Angela Lansbury already playing a mother character in this movie. A role she could still play just as well and convincingly now, almost 50 years later. Was this woman ever young?But I really don't regard this movie a a perfect one. The story gets to confusing for that at times and there are also lots of moments in the movie that just coma across as pointless and completely redundant, such as the entire Janet Leigh character. Seems that the movie had too much story to handle and to cram in, which might very well be the case, since this movie got based on a novel. Still a special thriller after all these years, due to how 'modern' and effective it is with its story and overall approach.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Programmed Mind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a frightening thought. But back during the Cold War, the idea of hypnotizing someone to carry out some sinister political act, like assassination of a foreign leader, was tossed around, originating probably from the "black ops" of the CIA or the KGB, or some such. Programming the mind of one Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), a Korean War soldier captured by an enemy nation of the U.S., is the premise of "The Manchurian Candidate", a film wherein the underlying theme is potent, but the story is not.The plot here turns domestic, with Shaw's mother and stepfather playing central roles in the drama. The parental influence negates real potency that the film might otherwise have had. Neither Shaw's mother nor his stepfather has the level of political power that we associate with acts of subversion. Toward the end we see what all of this has been leading up to. But the overall plot is too indirect and circuitous to live up to the power of the underlying premise.Senator Iselin (James Gregory) is too much of a buffoon. His presence weakens the story. Janet Leigh's character is more intriguing. But we never learn much about her. Assorted peripheral characters take hits, but again, they're too unimportant to have any political significance.The script is very talky. Lots of back story and exposition in the dialogue dilutes suspense.By far, the best element of the film is the sequence near the beginning, which shows us the brainwashing of the captured soldiers. The editing here is just terrific. Scenes cleverly alternate between the reality of the Chinese man giving a demonstration of hypnosis, and the delusional POV of the soldiers, listening to a lecture about hydrangeas.Casting is okay, except for Laurence Harvey, whose British accent belies the fact that his character is supposed to be an American, and James Gregory, an actor who does not project well on screen. Overall acting trends melodramatic. The film's overall tone is cold and very impersonal, consistent with the Cold War era.Overall, although it has its good moments, "The Manchurian Candidate" suffers from a plot that is too domestic. As a result, the political force of the underlying theme is lost. For truly riveting political intrigue and drama, I much prefer "The Day Of The Jackal" (1973).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a gem. A keeper.In my mind, THIS is the movie that proves once and for all Ol' Blue Eyes could act. Just watch his face, especially the eyebrows, during the drunken monologue of Raymond (played to a "T" by Laurence Harvey).Angela Landsbury is so damn evil in this movie. What a job of acting! I thought it was a hoot that she was the mortal enemy of Senator Jordan, played by the ever warm and fuzzy John McGiver, her co-star in the Disney musical Bedknobs and Broomsticks. I never considered Landsbury as "sexy," but in this movie, hoo-boy! The scene where she gives Raymond, her son, directions to kill Jordan makes the audience expect a little Mother-Son action. Steamy.This also had to be one of the finest roles for veteran character actor James Gregory as the McCarthy-esqe Senator Iselin. He switches between blustering bully to meek Momma's Boy in an eye-blink with ease.Even the supporting cast shined in this movie, such as frequent Sinatra co-star and "fringe Rat Packer" Henry Silva (who can play - and HAS played - just about every ethnic type you can think of).Turner Classic Movies is showing it now and then; set up the DVD and then wait for a nice rainy Sunday afternoon, make some popcorn, and enjoy.</fullReview>

Several movies come to mind that attempt this; 2001, Citizen Kane, Rushmore, a couple others.Manchurian Candidate is an audacious piece of art, a hilarious comedy, a wise and irreverent skewering of politics, and a worthy attempt to reinvent film. It also borrows recognizable figures and moments from history and tosses that into the mix too. This is a knowing retake on McCarthyism, with a deliriously paranoid storyline. Cataloging the films conceits would (and has) produce(d) its own essays.The cinematography almost convinces you you're watching some lost, third Welles masterpiece. (after Kane and Ambersons) Only the last scene falters a bit. It's a strange depressing tone to end such a bizarre movie on, but the movie is so good, it's a minor quibble.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting story upon cold war</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first film that I have ever watched Frank Sinatra as an actor, The Manchurian Candidate is an interesting example 50's world and USA. Sergeant Raymond Shaw, one of the 77 people who took medal of honor because of the duty in Korean War, saves nine soldier's life. At least it is announced in this way but no one knows the reality that he is brainwashed for some purposes. But Major Marco has the nightmares that explain the condition of Raymond.Furthermore, Raymond's mother is married to Senator Iselin and his mother uses the story of Raymond for the purpose of taking the presidency. In this way, Raymond is imposed for lots of murders including his fresh wife and employer. Now candidate of president must be killed by him and but it doesn't work, in other words Raymond does the things which he wants to do mostly.The director uses the queen of diamond in the scenes in which Raymond starts to action by the effect of brainwashing. But, his mother still believes the effect of it and she waits for action. Most people ask why the Major Marco didn't arrest him after killing his wife and her father but the reason appears in the last scene. The scene that Major opened the playing cards (52 queen of diamond) to Raymond before convention is a sign that Raymond tries to escape.If I leave logical explanations, it was a very funny joke that Rosie told to Marco. Rosie leaves her engaged for Marco and says "I said I wasn't married, but I didn't say I was engaged". Also the fighting scenes among Major and Chunjin is remarkable. Sending Chunjin to Raymond is important not to cut relations with him for some people.According to the comments that I read related to it, a new version was made. Although I have never watched new one, I think it can't be fantastic for this Lastly, most critical point is that : To become the president of USA, there is no need for intelligence. Nowadays Bush verifies this sentence unfortunately.</fullReview>

Raymond's mother, his "controller" doesn't realize this nor does she know that Raymond has been "deactivated" by Maj. Marco, when, she reveals to Raymond that not only is she a communist spy, and his controller, but also that he, Raymond is to be used in a murder plot of the Presidential nominee of the party where "Johnny" (Shaw's hated stepfather) is the Vice Presidential nominee.

I can't understand why Sinatra and the rest of the intelligence officers didn't capture Sergeant Shaw immediately after they discovered how he was being brainwashed. And I REALLY don't understand why Bennet left Shaw in the hands of Jocy.

		<fullReview>and was just as gripping when re-released in 1988. The local P.B.S. station showed it a week ago, I think to thumb their noses at the "re-make" if that thing on steroids can be dignified with the name.The cinematography was stunning, and the black-and-white gave the film a balefulness from which colour might have distracted. There are some small items which even my uneducated eye caught, however:- Senator Iselin is rather too much the hapless buffoon, why in a moment. I found the depiction of the character so central to the "plot" hard to swallow. True, the director/ writers wanted to make Mrs Iselin a powerhouse, but it was not necessary to create a flaccid man to make her the puissant woman.-Raymond was so wooden that he was at times unbelievable (note the fine head of hair rarely mussed), again no doubt to set off his dynamic mother. Almost by way of contradiction, Mr Harvey was a good choice. I recall in BUTTERFIELD 8 that when he tried to show emotion, Harvey always looked like he was going to split a gut, so this unpleasant version of a STAR TREK Vulcan was a role made for him.- Does anyone REALLY think a woman who meets a border-line mental case in a train is going to give him her address and telephone number? (That said, it is one of the most charming scenes in CANDIDATE.)Returning to Iselin. The novel was published in 1957, the same year Joseph P. "Tail-gunner Joe" McCarthy died. This story is a satire on McCarthyism! "Tail-gunner" was nothing like Iselin, rather as nasty as the Missus. The thesis turns right-wing paranoia -- a salient feature of American political culture -- on its head, to-wit: how to use American political culture against itself. A jab from the "right" is really a haymaker from the "left." The science fiction angle of post brain-washing manipulation is just the vehicle to make larger social commentary. Note how Americans bend over to make themselves vulnerable to a cynical element "within," a story especially for our times.</fullReview>

It is very difficult to convey to people who did not live through the cold war years exactly what it was like to live in fear of Iron Curtain rhetoric and threats. This film encapsulated the paranoia felt by myself, if nobody else. I had a love of science fiction as well, which led to 'The Manchurian Candidate' to be the best film I have ever seen. I bored friends and colleagues to death for years afterwards retelling the plot and storyline over and over again. I understand that Frank Sinatra tried to buy up and destroy all prints of this film following JFK's assassination. I have discovered that a remake is in production as I write. It will take a miracle to capture the stark horror of the 'lost platoon's' predicament and the portrayal of the brainwashing as seen through their eyes; the cynical and evil manipulations of Raymond Shaw's mother and the abrupt ending. Brilliant! It could only have been realized by John Frankenheimer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what Hollywood filmmakers are thinking with their 2004 remake of an already flawless picture....but if you decide to see the updated version, don't do so without viewing the original. It is the apex of just about all resumes involved.Laurence Harvey (who can best be described as robotic and charmless as an actor) actually appears human in this film and acts splendidly. Though better known for his earlier social climbing melodramas like Room at the Top and Butterfield 8, he actually gets to act here. ****SLIGHT SPOILER*** Though he is a conditioned assassin and does, indeed act robotic when under his little hypnotic trance, you feel for him in a way like you would for a friend. ****END SPOILER***Frank Sinatra (who should have given up on singing and concentrated solely on acting) is fantastic here. Though his previous forays into dramatic acting (From Here to Eternity, The Man With the Golden Arm, Some Came Running) were top notch....he is in fine form here also. Though Janet Leigh may seem mere window dressing here....is she really something more? Listen to her conversation on the train with Sinatra very closely and decide for yourself. Angela Lansbury is fantastic also as Commie Dearest to poor Laurence Harvey.Frank Sinatra acquired the rights to the film and had it pulled from theaters after it too closely mirrored the events of close friend JFK's assassination. He held the film out of the public eye for 25 years, not allowing it to be re-released until 1988.Having been born in 1961....I never saw this film until it was re-released in 1988 and was so transfixed the first time I saw it that I immediately rewound the tape and watched it again. (Any time I watch a film completely through and don't utter a word....it is a marvelous film. It only happened one other time...The Deer Hunter). The Manchurian Candidate loses NOTHING upon repeated viewings.This film also is often regarded as the pinnacle of director John Frankenheimer's career. Though he also did a fine job with the widely dismissed and underrated Black Sunday....this is indeed Frankenheimer's finest hour. He laces the film with tension, some necessary humor, and wild believability of a seemingly implausible plot. Everything is thrown in here....military cover-ups, suggested incest, Commie bashing on a grand McCarthyesque scale, Cold War implications.Even though the Cold War has thawed out, the film can still be seen as relevant and pertinent today. Just check out the political incompetents we have screaming at us now and you can identify with the John Iselin character of this film.Some may complain about the film's more-than-two-hour length....but I can honestly say that I can't find anything I would delete from it without lessening the quality of the final product.This film has it all. Crisp direction, a gripping story and script, great acting....and the added luck of the timing with which it was released. Don't think that's important??? Then go talk to the people who released The China Syndrome only two weeks before the nuclear mishap at Three Mile Island.The 1950s paved the way for Hollywood to be more daring with its mainstream releases in the '60s....and The Manchurian Candidate definitely qualifies as such. It took risks and probably is the best film of its kind. It dared to be different and was rewarded for its endeavors.I went to a garden party.....and I learned my lesson well.....After you watch the film....the lyrics to the song will take on relevance. Believe me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Top-10 Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(some spoilers)The Manchurian Candidate is one of the best thrillers ever made. The concepts invoked (hypnosis, conspiracy, ruthlessness) give the tale more clout, as far as innovation in cinematic themes are concerned. I think the storyline and characterization speak for themselves, so I'll focus on some other technical aspects of the film. The dream sequences are, at first confusing but always eerie. Frankenheimer beings the scene with a full 360 degree shot that allows us to see everyone in the room. Many of the character's actions are deliberate and obviously meaningful. Many of the older women are either displaying action, or their physicality is exaggerated in some fashion. These traits are essential for the doubling of action for the ?mirror-side' of the dream/lecture. The male spectators and the chief doctor are all ?palindromes' of the women's orchid society. The brilliance of this concept can be found in the fact that although this idea is not critical to implement, it serves as an opportunity to bring more ingenuity into an already pioneering picture. Another interesting element that is constantly played with is the use of Abraham Lincoln to incorporate political distinctions. Before a news conference Sen. Iselan strikes a pose in front of a Lincoln portrait. The camera focuses on the painting, but we are meant to see the senator's reflection. Later, Raymond's mother seems to casually walk by a marble bust of the former President, and the ironically enough, the senator is dressed as Lincoln at a costume party. I believe we are meant to infer that the senator probably has decent intentions to be a major contributor for ?this great nation', but we also understand that he will be cut down before even the slightest degree of any greatness can be measured. Although Lincoln was killed after he triumphed over a national dispute, Sen. Iselin will be eliminated before his tendencies can be invoked.Simply Amazing.**** (of ****)</fullReview>

The Janet Leigh character has to be a control of some kind - what the hell was that conversation on the back of the train about, if she isn't - and exactly what Raymond Shaw was prgrammed to do - or Marco for that matter - can be debated for hours.On a cinematic level, most of the acting performances are first rate, including Angela Landsbury Jocasteran performance in particular.</fullReview>

The obligatory fight scene was a stoop below the otherwise high quality of story telling. A satisfying movie.

		<shortDescription>Passing The Time By Playing Solitaire With Control Of The US</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It took 25 years of lack of access to this film before it really took off as a chilling classic. Following the Kennedy assassination, Frank Sinatra took his film off the market, keeping it locked away until releasing it on video in 1988. The wait made interest in the film grow and it is thus seen today as a true political/science fiction classic."The fact that people have read all kinds of connotations into this thing is funny, because we set out to do Dick Condon's book and that's what we did," producer George Axelrod noted in 1988. That people would read connotations into the film is natural given the allegories involved in the story. The most obvious lies in the character of Senator John Yerkes Iselin, a McCarthy clone whose is universally called an idiot for his savage anti-Communism. The punchline comes in that Iselin really is on to something, for Soviet Russia and China have teamed for an audacious scheme beginning in 1952 Korea with the capture of a US patrol lead by Captain Bennett Marco (Frank Sinatra) and Sergeant Raymond Shaw (Laurence Harvey), as unctuous and full of himself in his own way as his father-in-law Iselin, a father-in-law Raymond hates without letup.Shaw's familial connections are key to the scheme hatched in Manchuria at a place called Tong Wa, which leaves the squad with two members killed and the rest rescued by Shaw. Raymond gets the Medal of Honor upon his return to the States - except that his actions were manifestly not what the Medal of Honor claims they were.Now a Major, Bennett Marco is the first to realize something is amiss, as recurring nightmares stress his ability to perform his duties, to the point of being placed on indefinite sick leave. But when another surviving member of the squad reports the exact same nightmares, the Army now must assign Marco to investigate Raymond Shaw.Marco's most pointed question lies in a motion by Raymond's hands in the dream - a motion that Marco suddenly remembers when Raymond suddenly asks to play a game of solitaire, then acts with supreme oddness upon completing the game. When Raymond suddenly gets married to a love thought lost, then she and her father (a famous Senator who leads opposition to Iselin) are gunned down in their home, Marco must act to try and deduce what will happen next - and learns not only what the real plot is, but who is the real American brains behind it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant, timely warning against Communism. Warning, contains SPOILERS</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All the reviews you read on this film talk about how it acts as a warning against both extreme Left and Right (extreme Right being the myth of "McCarthyism"). Perhaps understandable considering to tell the truth would have given away a vital plot twist.My only real problem with the film is its portrayal of the Iselin character, particularly the scene where Angela Lansbury decides how many Communists he should say are working for the Government. This bears absolutely no resemblance to fact. But unsurprising considering the time. As was shown, McCarthy was correct. Apart from that, and the overall buffoonery of the character, the film is superb.It brilliantly illustrates the very real Communist threat at the time, and Communist infiltration of the American political system. And of course, the revelation that Shaw's mother is, in fact, a Communist spy only confirms that anyone could have been a Communist spy. Those who claim this is a warning against both sides of the political coin are wrong. It really is a fervently anti-Communist film- whether it meant to be or not.I agree with the reviewer who said the end was rather straightforward. Furthermore, I felt they gave away Shaw's mother's true purpose a bit too early. But that is just a quibble.All the acting was good- the standouts being Laurence Harvey and, of course, the magnificent Angela Lansbury. Knowing her first, and really exclusively, as J.B. Fletcher, America's most prolific serial killer, I was truly amazed by her performance. I've seen her in bit roles from the 30s or 40s, but she really showed her talent here. Especially in her speech near the end, with the camera close up on her frenzied face, as she prepares for total domination of America, and the world. I was a bit sad when she turned out to be a spy. I really liked the character.Although the film is very good, I don't think it's as fresh-feeling as most people seem to think. I think it's very much of its time, and in today's context a lot of the plot seems hysterical (after the west, well Reagan and Mrs. Thatcher, won the Cold War, the threat of Communist subversion doesn't seem like much of a threat). Very true at the time, I think its significance today is more in its style and surrealism than its main plotline. Though, of course, you can just see the Clintons in Shaw's mother and Senator Iselin.So, a very stylish, very odd film that though not really as relevant as it once was, is a testament to the style of the 60s and a time when Hollywood could produce a brilliant thriller with great direction, writing and acting (best of all Lansbury's searing performance).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this on Showtime (and since I Tivo'd it, I rewatched scenes for clarification). A few things struck me: Janet Leigh's character SEEMS to be Major Marco's American operative (for the good guys?). The Major's key seemed to be a flickering flame... Janet Leigh lit something in front of him in all their scenes (maybe just a red herring). So along those lines, it seemed that the higher ups he revealed the brainwashing to MAY have decided to use the Major for THEIR possible use. So of course Marco, along with the audience, would NEVER know this; kinda like "Memento's" p.o.v.And one more thing, was the Korean valet guy supposed to be the American contact for an unknowing Shaw? That just seemed like a ridiculous plot hole. I was kinda watching it thinking that Major Marco was actually the operative and he didn't consciously know it. Alas, the ending was more straight forward than the twists and turns that my head had cooked up while watching and rewatching scenes for clues. Still, an excellent film story that hasn't really aged a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could be better, eh Frankie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Indeed, this movie is a classic and has a lot of things going for it. Frank Sinatra does a good job as Bennett Marco and Angela Lansbury is outstanding as Mrs. Iselin; however, Laurence Harvey was less than impressive as Raymond Shaw and really detracted from the entire experience of The Manchurian Candidate. The whole idea of this movie is a great one and deserves so much more than it got with the making of this movie; even by early-1960's standards. I can't say I've ever seen a movie by John Frankenheimer that I've really liked; in fact, The Manchurian Candidate is problem the best I've seen of him. The screenplay was yet another detracting point of this movie and was a bigger problem than Frankenheimer and Harvey put together.I cannot wait to see the remake of The Manchurian Candidate with Denzel Washington; who, in my opinion, is one of the greatest actors of all time. Daniel Pyne wrote the screenplay for The Manchurian Candidate (2004) which seems like it could be a good thing since the he did the screenplays for both The Sum of All Fears and Any Given Sunday which were both quite well done. Dean Georgaris also worked on the screenplay for the remake which, in my opinion, doesn't mean a whole for either the good or the bad since his work has only been seen in Paycheck and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle of Life. Another promising aspect of the remake is Meryl Streep who, although I am anything but a fan of hers, is arguably one of the best actresses of the past 50 years. Jonathan Demme directed the remake and although he hasn't done much high profile work in the past ten years he did turn in some great work in Philadelphia (1993) and The Silence of the Lambs (1991). I am curious as to how well Liev Schreiber will portray Raymond Shaw, but I suppose it all depends on his chemistry with the other actors in the film.I am very much looking forward to the remake of this classic movie and I truly hope this new generation of actors and actresses can do more with this truly awesome story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moral nihilism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, great movie, especially for its time. But it is the message of this movie that concerns me. Spoilers:First, we are shown a scene in which two murders take place. Yet, the killer was hypnotized, remembers nothing, and thus feels no guilt. He does not feel he has done anything wrong because he cannot remember doing anything wrong, an amnesic moral nihilism: every action is as morally acceptable as any other, but only due to memory loss. This amnesia is used to sooth the anxious viewer who has just seen a man brutally strangled and a young boy shot in the head. "Yes he is a killer," they say, "but he was not aware of his actions. He had been brainwashed by evil Russian/Chinese communists." So it's not really a moral nihilism.Or is it? The murderer gets cured of his brainwashings, and guess what? He again kills two innocent people. He shoots another man, and instead of shooting a pure little boy, he even more horribly kills a woman who happens to be his mother. You may say that these last two victims were not innocent, you are partly right. They were corrupt city officials who had taken good notes while reading Machiavelli, but their only crime was slander, and perhaps conspiracy to murder. For they were not the two who ordered the murder of the first two victims. They may have been accomplices, but they had never committed any crime even closely worthy of the death penalty they received.So, just as with the first two murders, two innocents are killed and no moral guilt is shown. The killing was premeditated and coldly enacted, and what's more, he no longer had the excuse of amnesia and hypnosis to justify his actions. Full of his faculties, he had chosen murder: moral nihilism.Again, you may say that the suicide proves that he had felt guilty. In reality, the premeditation shows that he had taken everything into account. It was the fact that he would be perceived as guilty that he chose to end it. Moreso, the love of his life had just been heartlessly murdered as well. With nothing to live for in a life of prison, he had nothing to live for in the hope that he may have been someday released either. Thus the suicide did not show moral guilt, but judicial guilt. So then, not only is this movie a historical must-see because of its entertainment value, it is also a piece of the puzzle in understanding our presently deteriorated morality.</fullReview>

However, with all of the current hype calling the 1962 edition a classic, I decided that perhaps I was wrong not to have seen it in '62. So I took advantage of a PBS airing and watched it today. I wasn't wrong in '62!The plot was thin and totally predictable. For example, in one scene, during train ride Sinatra's character has an anxiety attack that's so bad he can't even light a cigarette. He knocks over a dining table and staggers out with the sweats to a compartment at the end of the car - Janet Leigh, (they've never met before) who witnesses this sweaty attack (and who's also engaged to be married to someone she has met before)follows him out to the compartment and falls in love with him and runs home to dump the current boyfriend! C'mon.....(And that's one of the better scenes.)I wont go into the other scenes, but there are roadsigns throughout, with big arrows pointing to the next event.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone know what a thriller really is?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I read all these comments about what a great thriller The Manchurian Candidate is, and I have to wonder what people think a thriller is -- or are they easily thrilled? The plot of the film is full of unbelievable contrivances, which stood out like sore thumbs even in 1962 when people were less savvy about everything. The film apparently disappeared for a number of years and legends grew about it, so that people remembered it as being better than it truly was. (I didn't remember it that way since I recalled leaving the theater in 1962 wondering what the fuss was about.) Okay, there are some good performances in the film -- Sinatra and Laurence Harvey are both especially good, despite Harvey's accent being totally inappropriate. Everyone raves about Angela Lansbury's performance but while she was good it was hard to be convinced by her so-called evil because it was based on the unlikely contrivance that this New England rich lady would be in league with the communists and also so powerful she could control them and special order an assassin, who just happens to be her son. (But, oh, she'll get revenge for that!) Janet Leigh is very beautiful but totally wasted; it's too bad she doesn't remove her blouse as Leslie Parrish did. Otherwise, her whole role could be removed and it would have no effect whatsoever on the movie. But back to contrivances -- it's hard enough to believe that the mere sighting of a card would send a man into a trance; we also have to believe that he doesn't even get suspicious when people keep suggesting "Hey, how about a little solitaire?" He always obliges! He never says, "I don't like solitaire." Or, "How about canasta or Go Fish?" Then his girlfriend, in another contrivance worthy of Hitchcock (the master contriver of absurd situations), shows up dressed as the Queen of Diamonds. No one ever explains exactly why she did this. It's too silly for words. Maybe some of the other commenters are right -- this is supposed to be a black comedy. We can pretend Sinantra is Mel Brooks and Laurence Harvey is Gene Wilder. Now all we need is someone to be Richard Pryor. But as for thrills, I sat on the edge of my seat all right -- so I could get up quickly as soon as this was over! One final comment -- the so-called martial arts fight between Sinatra and Henry Silva (what happened to his character anyhow?) was so embarrassing to both the men and their stunt doubles, I had to fast forward through it! I've seen better fighting on a Get Smart episode (more realistic too). Other than these few carping remarks, I have to agree -- what a classic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The vivid scenes of Harvey killing his friends, while the rest of the platoon are brainwashed into thinking they are at a flower arranging meeting lingers long in the memory. If only the rest of the film were up to this standard, it would indeed be a 'cold war classic', But alas, these scenes are not only the highlight of this film, but serve as a fitting metaphor to Hollywood's attitude to the evil of communism, which at that time had killed in excess of 100 million and had at least 30 million in concentration camps.This being Hollywood, the "communist" turns out to be a decent family man while the "rightwinger" is really the sadistic murderer. Imagine a film about Nazis to see Churchill secretly the villain. Someone should have sent all involved a book about the real horrors which were unfolding day by day.Beyond failing as propaganda (its chief objective, it fails as a story. Several plot points are unconvincing and contrived. I'm not sure whether these points are in the original book, but they appear tacked on, as if to give the audience a conventional amount of romance and action.The first is the implausible and unconvincing Romantic interest of Janet Leigh- how many beautiful women come on to sweaty nervous guys on trains, and then insist on giving him, unbidden, their numbers and home addresses? I would have been prepared to accept the implausibility of this if it had led somewhere but sadly it does not. Next the fist fight between Sinatra and Harvey's servant, which is never fully justified and never mentioned afterwards.Nor is it never explained how Harvey waltzes into a secure area and is able to find the perfect vantage point, an unguarded room, to shoot from. Inside help? Quite possibly but it goes without explanation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A candidate for a list of overrated films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Few things are as disappointing as watching a "classic" film you've heard so many wonderful things about which doesn't end up matching the hype. The Manchurian Candidate falls into that unfortunate category of films. It has an admittedly fascinating story to work with but that story is not very well executed. The story is ultimately undermined by some absurd twists along the way. It's a brainwashing tale that's not particularly believable to begin with. But even if you buy into that main premise the coincidences and contrivances required to move the story along will ultimately leave you shaking your head. And the story surely doesn't move along quickly enough, to say the film's pace is laborious would be overly kind. It's quite a slog to get to the end. By the time you get to the finish all the tension has drained away, the promise of the film's intriguing beginning is long gone.The film tells the story of Raymond Shaw, a supposed Korean War hero who actually is a brainwashed unwitting assassin. The flashbacks which show Raymond's conditioning are certainly bizarre but they definitely grab your attention. It would seem the film has some very interesting places to go from there. But things quickly fizzle out. Major Bennett Marco, who served with Shaw in Korea, has terrible nightmares which hint at the awful truth. Marco is determined to get to the bottom of things but initially receives no support from Army brass. He ends up taking a train ride where he engages a woman in the most bizarre, nonsensical conversation in film history. If you're hoping the film will later provide some context or explanation for this conversation that hope will be in vain. This is where the film begins to veer off course. Matters are not helped by the fact that this woman who just met the clearly troubled, unstable Marco immediately breaks off her engagement with her fiance to be with Marco instead. Credulity begins to be strained.Meanwhile there's the other plot thread with Marco's mother using Shaw's war heroics to push her husband, Shaw's stepfather, forward in his political career. Unfortunately Senator Iselin is a clueless, drunken buffoon. He seems completely incapable of coherent thought, it's his wife pulling all the strings in a McCarthyist anti-Communist witch-hunt. Surely the storyline of the son, the unwitting killer, and the husband, the pathetic politician, are due to come together. What is Mrs. Iselin's master plan? When we find out it's too late to save the film, too many things have already gone wrong.Angela Lansbury gives an excellent performance as the villainous Mrs. Iselin and Frank Sinatra handles the Marco role with aplomb. But the other pieces don't fall into place. Laurence Harvey is never entirely convincing in the key role of Shaw. There's one scene in which Shaw is blubbering about how he's not lovable that is so bad it's uncomfortable to watch. Apart from that Harvey is very bland and dry. The less said about the Janet Leigh character, that woman Marco meets on the train, the better. Never for a moment do you believe anything that character says or does. The Senator is such a complete idiot it's impossible to take him at all seriously. The film can't even get a simple fight sequence right. Sinatra may have done a good job with his acting but let's just say his kung fu leaves a lot to be desired. The film labors along to its end, an end that is meant to be shocking but isn't. Much has been made about the supposed great tension in the film's final minutes leading to that "shocking" end. But the ending really is quite predictable. It's the last letdown in a film full of them. There's a great story in this film someplace. But the film doesn't do that story justice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual choice of pistol for dream sequence shooting ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Raymond is asked to shoot one of his own men in the dream sequence, the gun is provided by Captain Marco (Frank Sinatra) from his service holster; however, this gun is not an American service pistol but is a German WWII Walther P38 9mm automatic pistol. This type of pistol has never been issued to American forces and was not used by North Korean, Chinese or Russian forces. I have to wonder why this prop was used in this movie and one might guess that it may have been provided at very short notice from the prop department by someone unfamiliar with firearms. It is an unusual oversight, as the more common .45 caliber Colt M1911 should have been easily available and would have been much more familiar to anyone who had served in the U.S. armed forces and also to several of the actors, including Mr. Sinatra. I would imagine that one chilling aspect of this scene would have been the use of Captain Marco's own pistol and the intent should have been to further emphasize that the shooting was being carried out by Raymond with Captain Marco's (U.S. issue) service pistol. To use a German pistol therefore appears arbitrary to me and hence an oversight/error.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascist fantasies...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to watch a film that deals with a historical tragedy if it leans heavily on the victim's side--that is, on the one who is conquered, vanquished, oppressed;the one who didn't intend and is merely at the receiving-end of the catastrophe.For it's clearly defined where our "sympathies" should lie.Our moral duty as film-viewers is unambiguously called to task and eventually fulfilled.Thus, in a film about Nazism and the Holocaust, we are almost always moved by the fate of the Jews, the sole target of the so-called "racial cleansing" (e.g., the Hungarian Jews in Kjell Grede's 'Good Evening, Mr. Wallenberg').Or in a film that portrays Japan's imperialist might during World War II, it's not unlikely that we're on the side of that country's colonial subject (e.g., the Chinese villagers in about the second half of Zhang Yimou's 'Red Sorghum').But what if the supposed aggressors were also the unwilling victims? Would it be easy for us to look at the other side of the coin? Such daring questions may possibly come up upon watching Volker Schlndorff's 'The Tin Drum' (TD) and Shohei Imamura's 'Black Rain' (BR). The two films deal with a critical period in their respective countries' history:the rise of Adolf Hitler and his National Socialist (Nazi) party in Germany and the dropping of the atomic bomb in Hiroshima, Japan. Both events were inextricably linked with the Second World War, wherein Germany's and Japan's roles were, unfortunately, always viewed in the nature of destruction and assimilation.So we can imagine the risky and unconventional position of Schlndorff's and Imamura's films.The two master directors didn't have to move away from home, so to speak, to illustrate the horrific implications of the Fhrer and the Bomb. As they saw it, it wasn't only the exterminated Jews and the colonized territories that were the immediate victims of a destructive craving for world dominion;it was also the people of their own.In The Manchurian Candidate, it's the Sinatra, who had the "misfortune" of being born in a "disgusting" world (something which he already "perceived" while still in his mother's womb!) ;in Battle Royale, it's a Japanese landowner couple and their 25-year-old niece named Yasuko, who never thought that their lives would dramatically change with the installation of the BR Program.But these unwilling--if not unlikely--victims have their own way of facing up to the monumental monstrosities that are of their own nations' making.Watching these films (there are at least twelve or more) brings to mind a more subtle, though no less interesting, phenomenon; The political dialog of any given World Power being dominated as it is by the successful party's mastery of the cinematic narrative. We just cannot help ourselves; we like to be shown that the world is so.But once you start those machinations going, you inherit ALL the baggage of the cinematic narrative, Jud Nelson comes along uninvited with your John Wayne. This has nothing at all to do with conservative values; it is just a result of adopting the movie world as the basis for your beliefs.I can understand this thread of influence and consequence when it applies to nuclear energy: the US makes and deploys a bomb: many, many movies are made showing the evil side. And we end up with a public that has an unnatural fear of all things radioactive.But this thread is more interesting and profound and has stifled stem cell research in the US.To focus on unlikely victims is not to say that this "side" was more devastated than the "other" and so, is more "deserving" of our sympathies.Rather, it's one way of bringing across the painful lesson that in a historical tragedy like fascism and war, there are really no champions, only casualties.(At this point you're asking yourself, "What the hell is he talking about?")Well, to begin with the Iselins, particularly the Senator, are McCarthyism travesties--in both senses of the term. McCarthy, and this will not be well-received by most, was never anything like the clown that leftist academia and Hollywood has quite successfully made him out to be. The true history of this man's crusade against communism has been utterly erased from popular culture.(1) McCarthy was not a mad opportunist; he was simply not the brightest bulb in the room or a skilled enough politician, as it turned out, to sustain the credibility of his campaign against an onslaught of leftist propaganda.(2) The state department, particularly during the latter years of Roosevelt's presidency and Truman's presidency, was in fact littered with Marxist Soviet sympathizers and operatives.(3) I heard John lennon's imagine in wal-mart today. People humming along to "imagine no possessions" while filling there rolling cages with all sorts of crap. It reminded me of The Manchurian Candidate, whose ideologies were applauded by all but when we espoused those ideas in reality we weree laughed at. There is no harmony of pen and sword. Art is a meaningless fantasy. Yes it's great to imagine but we needn't do anything more, in fact those venues for imagining might actually do more harm than good, we resort into those fantasies instead of doing anything about it. What we can imagine, we needn't create.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I beg to differ</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit it was the high ranking this film has on IMDb what caused me to rent the DVD, (and also to watch the original before seeing the remake) but boy was I disappointed.This must be the worst script of any 8+ rated film.Considering the time it was created, I can sort of understand why it was made this way, what I cannot understand though is why people in the 21st century consider this anything but a historical document about the fifties/early sixties. today, 2005, how do people react to these concepts:Army is all good. the male world is divided between perfectly good brave heroic smart Americans and utterly bad, diabolic stupid but cunning Ruskies and Chinesewomen are blond and either demure or super-dominantUS senators are nothing but slapstick idiots controlled by power hungry wivesscience is all badsome scenes:a woman shares a table with a man she sees for the first time. he is obviously an alcoholic who cannot even manage to light a cigarette. of course she falls in love immediately and marries him.Finding out that his saviour and hero is in truth a killer machine controlled by the enemy a man's first reaction is to go write him a letter and spill it out. ... Let's take a poll: thrilling, masterpiece, nail-biting, suspense.I beg to differ: ridiculous, dated, predictable, simple-minded, army-glorifying, xenophobic caricature of life in the sixties.</fullReview>
