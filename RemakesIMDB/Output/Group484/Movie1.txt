		<shortDescription>The original is way better; evidence against the Hollywood film system</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is way inferior to the Dutch original (the fact that the same director directed both is another story). This movie has obviously been toned down for American audiences, which is insulting if you've seen them both (I stumbled onto the remake on cable late at night). The original is a thriller in the truest sense of the word, and is far more intelligent, disturbing, and scary than the Hollywood version. I bet the producers assumed American audiences couldn't handle disturbing well so they gave us a more friendly version, very insulting. If you're going to see this version, make sure you rent the original too and watch it first, just to see how much the remake pales in comparison. If you don't like psychological, disturbing, riveting, and no-downbeat-endings in your thrillers, the 1993 version is for you. But if you want to be truly blown away, the Dutch original is very highly recommended over this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hmmm...2 versions. Which should I watch?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As everyone who has reviewed this film here has mentioned, there are two versions of this movie, one Dutch, one American, both directed by the same fellow. Which should you see first? Which should you avoid, if any? Decide for yourself... I saw the Dutch version in 1994, and it absolutely blew my socks off. I was horrified, didn't want to keep watching it, but I was pulled in and couldn't stop until the brilliant, ultra-chilling, uncompromising finale. This was my first foreign film, and so I was completely unprepared for such a non-Hollywood experience. I will remember this movie for the rest of my life. Later on, I caught the American version in the theatres, watched it, a few thrills here and there, yadda, yadda. Jeff Bridges was pretty creepy, but quite frankly, I would have completely forgotten about it by now if it weren't for the original. It's not horrible, it just pales in comparison to a masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had I not seen the original Dutch film "Spoorloos" I might have given "The Vanishing" more credit. But it's a weak remake which gives American audiences all the gore that the original lacked and a reasonably happy ending which was nowhere to be found in the original. "The Vanishing" is the story of Jeff, whose claustrophobic girlfriend Diane goes missing from a gas station and never returns. For years, Jeff is plagued with guilt and never gives up on the search for Diane, not even after meeting Rita, with whom he begins a serious relationship. But Rita soon becomes sick of Jeff's obsession and leaves him after a bitter confrontation. It is at this point that Jeff's obsession pays off and Barney comes looking for him. Barney knows what happened to Diane, because he is the one who kidnapped her. But Barney will only tell Jeff what happened if Jeff agrees to go through everything that Diane went through without knowing in advance what that might be. Jeff agrees and disappears, and now it is Rita who is obsessed with discovering what has happened to him.This isn't a terrible film by any means. The performances are great, particularly by Keifer Sutherland as Jeff. His portrayal of the guilt-ridden, haunted man is near perfect. There are some great moments of comedy provided by Park Overall as Rita's friend Lynn. But "The Vanishing" lacks the power of "Spoorloos" despite a harrowing scene in which Jeff learns the fate of Diane firsthand, a scene which is identical to the original. Still, I don't understand why when a foreign film is remade for American audiences, it is almost always assumed that we want more gore and a happy ending, thank you very much. Both cheapen the story in this case. "Spoorloos" was a film of terrible sorrow and grim reality, both of which will (or at least SHOULD) leave even the most hardened horror fan shaken. "The Vanishing" is slightly less effective, going in for cheap thrills and a kick-ass finale a la Hollywood. I would recommend seeing it ONLY if you're going to watch "Spoorloos" as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>America didn't have the right to do this to a perfect story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When George Sluizer was told he could direct an American version of the book "Het Gouden Ei"/the movie "Spoorloos"(outside Holland, this movie has the name "the Vanishing" too), he was told that this would only go through if the ending was changed - He was told that 'the American Audience' wouldn't approve the original ending. Of course, the original ending is much better, and without it, the movie loses its impact. Because I have already put this in the trivia section, I won't give the original ending and keep my comment spoiler-free. If you want to know the original ending, watch "Spoorloos" or read the book. This movie is absolute rubbish, and the first Kiefer Sutherland movie I don't like. Watch the original Dutch movie, which is one of the best thrillers in the world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Horrid Mess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Skip this Hollywood version, a real piece of garbage. A cheap insult to the brilliant original "Spoorloos", or by the English title also called "The Vanishing". It completely misses the mark in typical, grotesque Hollywood fashion, usually due to a bunch of talentless, corporate bean counters who haven't the vaguest idea about anything artistic, they just look for the "successful formula" and want it applied to everything to glean a profit. Much like the awful "The Scarlet Letter" made in 1995, which twisted the original story around so much to suit the MacDonaldsland crowd, that it became an aberration, not even a bastardization, but a pile of goop that has been sort of shaped similar but does not look, feel or even remotely resemble the spirit of the original. Except that movie at least had Gary Oldman, who is interesting to watch in anything he does. This dog has nothing going for it, even the usually very talented Jeff Bridges is an embarrassment. Great tragedy is not nor never should be "the feel good movie of the year" but rather takes one or more of the sadly much too frequent tragic events in life and allows the reader/viewer to draw meaning and insight into the human condition.Do yourself a great favor if you're looking for a rental and skip this grotesque garbage and pick up the original made in a Dutch/French collaboration in 1988. That is a great film. This is a horrific mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good movie ruined by stupid ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie not knowing it was a remake of Spoorloos (1988). It wasn't until reading about the two movies on IMDb that I realized there was a difference in the endings. Saying that, here's my viewing experience: The movie started off well. I got involved with the characters, though I thought Diane (Sandra Bullock) was a whiny bitch and I probably would have done the same thing Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) does in the beginning when the car stalls in tunnel. Anyway, they do come across as a believable couple. I really think Jeff Daniels did an excellent job as Barney and the haircut, clothing, and mannerisms were perfect for this role. Nancy Travis was serviceable as Rita.By now, everybody knows the story, so I won't belabor that point. But to me the high point was the confrontation between Jeff and Rita once Rita discovers Jeff is still obsessed with finding Diane. Great scene with great acting, and a totally believable revelation from Jeff that his obsession isn't about still being in love with Diane, it's about not knowing what happened to her.**** BIG SPOILER ALERT **** The ending to me was very predictable, very typical, and very weak. Again, I had not (and still have not) seen the original. But I'm sitting there watching this and I'm going, "OK, Rita is gonna save the day and everything will be fine." Because that's what happens in these types of movies. And that's exactly what happens and it's terrible, because it's unbelievable. If Rita is this damn smart why is she just a waitress at a coffee shop? Moving on, my thoughts were that this movie would carry much more impact if it had ended with Jeff awakening in the coffin knowing he was buried alive and a slow fade away shot of Barney Cousins eating a solitary meal at his cabin, with Rita having no idea what happened (because she had left Jeff earlier that day "forever").Course, I then read on IMDb that's how the original ended (more or less). Now I'm off to find a copy of the original and compare it to this. Ciao.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Bungled Hollywood Movie Killed By Audience &amp; Critic Perceptions</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this remake of the 1988 Dutch film 'Spoorloos' writer Jeff Harriman (Kiefer Sutherland) searches for his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock) who disappeared from a gas station during a road trip they took 3 years earlier.His new girlfriend (Nancy Travis) tries to help him pick up the pieces of his life but gets increasingly frustrated over his fascination with the mystery. Diane's kidnapper Barney (Jeff Bridges) has his own interest piqued by Jeff.There still persists the perception that remakes are inferior to originals and that European cinema is artistically superior to Hollywood. This movie is used to illustrate those points. But these are far from the only reasons it flopped.The casting didn't follow the traditional route. It does not impact the quality of the production and should not be counted as negative. But it deflated the commercial appeal by ignoring the superficial tastes of moviegoers.Kiefer Sutherland is an actor audiences more readily accept as a darker character than victimized nice guy Jeff. This is well-evidenced by his critical triumph in the movie 'Freeway' three years later as a kidnapper/murderer. At the time he was also mostly seen bolstering ensemble casts rather than as a conventional male lead. His strong performance should have been enough to carry the film and it would have been had there not been other factors.Jeff Bridges was more readily accepted by audiences as a nice guy male lead. He wanted to play a creep for a change and did an impeccable job here. But audiences had to look past over 20 years of typecasting to accept him in the role and most couldn't. As a result one of the finest characterizations in his long, distinguished career is overlooked.No actress could have given a more convincing performance than Nancy Travis in the role of Rita, the heroine. But audiences liked Sandra Bullock better and have always wanted to see more of her which in this case would have meant giving her the more substantial role of Rita than the tragic role of kidnapped Diane.At the time (1991-92 pre-production) how could anyone know that Sandra Bullock would soon top the box office like few actresses before her? Nancy Travis had been in a string of hits but then little-known Bullock would surpass her as a star within 18 months of the release of this film. Had they known, there can be little doubt Bullock would have played Rita.The ultimate sin that North American film audiences could not forgive is obvious pandering to their own glaring superficial tastes when it comes to how movies end. The 1988 original European version haunted audiences and made them think because of its dark conclusion. That version didn't have a Hollywood ending and that was its payoff - one meant for an entirely different audience.The Hollywood version not only wraps up the conflict between the characters differently (rewarding perseverance over intellect, good over evil in typical Hollywood tradition), it also includes a tacked-on, whimsical denouement. North American film audiences DO prefer happy endings with neat and tidy closure.But expecting them to embrace the glaring implication that they can't handle scary and/or thought-provoking material is an unforgivable insult which could only elicit the kind of derision from reviewers that it has even though the action which leads up to it is far from boring or silly. Had the film been an original with a facile and obtuse resolution it would have been accepted if not embraced.Hollywood studios obviously have final approval on the cut released to theatres in most instances. A trick some auteurs can employ when attempting to keep the integrity of a darker-themed film is to wait until the deadline before delivering the finished product and including two endings. One ending will be the darker one they want. The other will be the happy ending - one shot and cut so badly that the studio will presumably have to go with the darker ending. This ploy might work if studios cared more about the quality of what they were releasing rather than its box office p potential.Then there is the release date - February, 1993. What happens in February in Western Culture every year? Valentine's Day! Does this look like a date movie to you? Everything about how this movie was made and marketed invited flop status.As I said the action which leads up to the finale is far from boring or silly. In fact much of it is quite watchable and on par with (and in many cases identical to) the original. Where it actually improves upon the original is in its addition of a female lead.Rita is much more interesting than Lieneke - the second girlfriend character in the original an incidental character compared with Rita. Affable, considerate, blessed with work ethic and self-deprecating modesty truck-stop waitress Rita is an unlikely heroine for a Hollywood film.Indeed truck-stop waitress is an occupation designed for comic relief or passive anonymity in most Hollywood cinema. A female lead can usually portray one only if her character arc ends in her being beneficiary of an extreme reversal of fortune i.e. marrying a rich dude or becoming a supermodel.Rita doesn't entertain herself with such fantasies but she does have aspirations. When Jeff walks in she remembers him from high school but he doesn't remember her. He pulls out a picture of Diane and asks if she has seen her. Rita says that her mind blots out most of the faces she sees. Yet she remembers him. This is a character that knows what she wants as unromantic as it may seem. This isn't what North Americans look for in movie heroines if you go by box office and surveys. They may live their lives differently and they even may be happy. But they go to movies to see something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know it's hard for you Americans to find European films on video/DVD, particularly from the 80's but please seek out the original version of the Vanishing - title Spoorloos (1988) - and you'll see why the Hollywood version of The Vanishing screws up bigtime, particularly at the finale.I really like Sandra Bullock, Kiefer Sutherland and particularly Jeff Bridges, but this is just so so lame compared with the original. What where they thinking? Can you imagine Seven with a happy ending with Gwyneth Paltrow running happily into the arms of Brad Pitt in the finale? The whole point the original was such a major international success was because of the shocking finale. So why do you accept this kind of shyte remake?

		<fullReview>This is the most frightening film ever made in Hollywood. It is a cautionary tale of how to take a European masterpiece and suck the life of of it until it is a dry husk like an insect carcass on the the windowsill. Frightening because it reveals how the world of Hollywood really works: ignorant money begetting dross. It makes me wonder how many great films could populate the corridors of my memory if the Hollywood process had not leveled them to forgettable mediocrity. Cry for the murdered children! See Spoorloos or read The Golden Egg, if you dare, because they will come back to you forever in the idle moments of your life: when you're walking along the street and you see a 'missing' poster; in ordinary-looking parking lots; when you hear the Tour De France on the radio; and, especially, when you you think "what's the harm?" in wearing a sock with a hole in it on a perfectly ordinary day.If only I could give this a zero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to destroy your career in one simple remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer's original version of The Vanishing aka The Man Who Wanted to Know offers one of European cinema's most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time (shamelessly stolen by Tarantino for Kill Bill Volume Two), but it has plenty more to offer than that. Playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichés of standard 'lady vanishes' plots, it also offers superb characterisation and strong, underplayed but convincing performances.Unfortunately, I can only assume that when it came to the remake, Sluizer was so determined that no-one else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was perfectly capable of doing it himself, but few people could have anticipated how comprehensively he trashes his own work. His career never recovered from this disastrous misstep.Chief culprit is an astonishing performance by Jeff Bridges that has been over thought through in every detail to a truly disastrous level. A friend who produced one of his earliest movies noted that Bridges was a great instinctive actor as long as you stopped him thinking about what he was doing, and this film is the proof of the pudding. Every movement is overly mechanical in its precision, making him look like a rusty clockwork toy, while his voice is a bizarre mixture of Tootsie, Latka Gravas from Taxi and a Dalek who have all been taking elocution lessons from Dok-tah E-ville. No banality of evil here, just a looney walking around with an invisible sign over his head saying "Please. Let. Me. Kill. You. Thank you. For your. Consideration.' But the blame really needs to be shared out here. None of the performances are good: often, they don't even look good ? Keifer Sutherland looks more like a baby hamster than a distraught man at his wits end in the hurried scenes at the gas station, Nancy Travis flounders badly and Sandra Bullock makes no impression at all as the object of his obsession. Not that they're given any help by either director or writer Todd Graff. The script is particularly weak. The chronology has been altered to put the focus firmly on Bridges at the expense of the couple at the opening of the film. Worse is the rush the film is in, draining the life and character from each scene in its race to get to the next. Rather than the high/low mood shifts in the couple's relationship or the apparently casual but careful establishing of the feel of the location, we just get a couple of arguments that give you the impression that he's probably better off without her. As for the new and improved happy ending ? standard woman chased by nutter in the woods jeopardy stuff complete with lame 'let's end on a joke like a TV cop show' moment ? best not go there? which is advice that holds for this entire trainwreck of a movie. Even a shockingly bland and uninspired Jerry Goldsmith score can't do anything for this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The varnishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An artist on the path to constant improvement often feels the urge to rework a finished piece. A fresh eye can see problems that had previously escaped attention, possibly because one was too close to the work to see even obvious defects.This certainly applies to filmmakers. Very few have the chance to completely remake the whole thing from start to finish. But this was the opportunity presented to Dutch filmmaker, Georges Sluizer when US producers approached him to create a new, English language version of his acclaimed film, "The Vanishing" or "Spoorloos" to give it the correct Dutch title; a unique opportunity to improve on the original.Did he succeed? To judge from nearly all the critics, the answer is a resounding no. The Hollywood version is dismissed as a poor imitation of the original at best and a total travesty at worst. Is the criticism justified or is it just a snobby attitude that automatically assumes European cultural superiority over Hollywood crassness, or did Sluizer sacrifice the integrity he had brought to the first version? The producers felt that American audiences would not accept the ending as it stood. As a result, the film received the most formulaic of endings, destroying the mood and underlying creepiness that made the original so disturbing.Jeff Bridges character, Barney Cousins, begins by experimenting with chloroform to see how long it takes to render someone unconscious. Bridges plays Barney as an eccentric character ? far more mannered than his opposite number in the Dutch version played by Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu.A young couple enters the story, Jeff Harriman and Diane Shaver, played by Keifer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock. They are travelling up the coast together and bicker constantly, creating the hot and cold relationship that was so effective in the original.After a number of incidents, they pull into a gas station. When Diane goes to the bathroom, she never returns. Jeff calls the police but Diane has vanished.Three years elapse and Jeff has never given up hope of finding Diane. He meets a waitress, Rita played by Nancy Travis, and they move in together. However, Jeff is still obsessed with finding Diane and Rita decides to leave.In the meantime, Barney sees Jeff on television. He eventually approaches Jeff and tells him that he was the person who abducted Diane.Barney receives a beating, but tells Jeff that the only way he will find out what happened to Diane is to go with him and be drugged, duplicating the way Diane was abducted. Jeff's need to know overrides all else and he agrees. He awakens to find himself buried alive; the fate that befell Diane. And that is where things were left in the original ? an uncompromisingly bleak ending.Not so in the remake.The last part of "The Vanishing" is not only changed physically but also symbolically from the harrowing ending of Sluizer's original. In fact, the ending is no longer harrowing; it's just predictable and pedestrian.The new version has Rita arriving in the nick of time to save Jeff. The film ends on a light-hearted note when Rita and Jeff both refuse a cup of coffee, having given up the beverage after experiencing Barney's thermos of laced coffee.Sluizer must have felt compelled to accept an ending that was so standard and safe that good work generated in other areas of the remake went for nothing ? but maybe it all goes back to the decision to redo it in the first place; "if it ain't broke, don't fix it".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was little I read the original book written by Tim Krabbé. I must say this movie had very strong actors and actresses. Jeff Bridges was awesome and so was Kiefer Sutherland. I know it is almost 2013 and I just saw the movie, but is was worth watching.The reason I rate this movie low, is because I think Hollywood had thrown their own juice on Krabbés original story and that just did not work out well. In the original story, the story ends where Kiefer us buried. In this movie such an ending did not work because it ain't happy. So the makers of this movie invented a second girlfriend in the story. So at first I thought Bridges would kidnap her too and would like to mess up Kiefer's mind, but he didn't. That would have been the perfect juice on Krabbés story. But they didn't! So I stay with my opinion and that's if you want to make a movie based on a book, stay true to the original story of the book and don't create something of your own because of the lack of inventing a whole new story by yourself.</fullReview>

The true thinking man's psychopath is Jeff Bridge's "Barney" in this story about one man's (Kiefer Sutherland's) obsessive, years-long search for a girlfriend who disappeared during a vacation. Barney is also perhaps the nerdiest, most passionless movie psycho ever, and for all these reasons one of the most terrifying. This film is light on gore and action (some might say "slow-paced"), but it is a disturbing look at the "banality of evil." I'm told that the original Dutch film of the same name is far more disturbing than even this.</fullReview>

For me, however, the relationship between Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) and Rita (Nancy Travis) also takes away the from the original film as to me the feeling of obsession by Jeff on finding his missing girlfriend is totally lost.The character played by Jeff Bridges does not appear as cold and calculating as in the original although I would admit he does give a reasonable performance but the whole feeling of menace is lost early in the film.All in all a very poor remake! Stick with the original it's very dark, very chilling and very entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite the critics here, I thought it was a 'good' thriller. This movie touches the real emotions people experience when confronted with something like abduction.* "The fear" when you discover that you have lost someone out of the eye. Right to the point where you realize that you have lost them.* "The doubt" and the "need to know what happened", which is also found in reality and is even worse then knowing the throuth.* The theme: "Curiosity killed the cat"* The "burried alive" scene. Very spooky and realisticly filmed.It did not know that this movie was a remake of a Dutch movie and since I am Dutch, I definetly am going to see that one....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kiefer Sutherland is brilliant, Sandra Bullock exquisite...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, I know, the Dutch original, Spoorloos, by the same director is supposedly far superior, but since I haven't as yet found or seen it, I can only comment on the American remake. It is definitely the most disturbing movie I've ever seen. Jeff (Sutherland) and Diane (Bullock in a too-short role) stop at a rest area while on vacation. She goes in to buy drinks, and he never sees her again. Three years later, he meets someone new (Nancy Travis) but is still obsessed with finding Diane. After he goes on TV and pleads for information (you kind of wonder why he hasn't done this earlier, or why there seem to be no other family members looking for her, but I guess these are irrelevant questions) the kidnapper Barney (Jeff Bridges) contacts him.Along with Jeff, we gradually come to realize what happened to Diane, and we are effectively sickened and saddened. Let me say that the beauty of this film is that other than the kidnapping, we are never shown what happens to Diane, only what Barney makes Jeff experience. Knowing it, but not seeing it (except as what happens to Jeff) is powerfully haunting. And for Sandy fans, the scene in which Jeff returns to the area where Diane disappeared, and envisions her again, makes this film worth seeing for that alone. Sutherland is brilliant and Bullock is at her most exquisitely beautiful. I burst into tears at this haunting and moving scene.Having said all that, Jeff Bridges' odd accent is annoying and just plain weird. Is it supposed to be Dutch? No explanation given. In any case, I am now unable to see Jeff Bridges in anything without feeling sick. ***BIG SPOILER*** Also, have you ever noticed how in movies it's light outside late at night, even in a forest? This is what conveniently enables Rita to dig up Jeff from his burial spot, and Jeff to see Diane's grave (actually a nice touch there), even though in reality it would be pitch black out there. Despite these and other minor flaws, I liked this film. To sum up, I'm ambivalent about recommending this movie, since it is so disturbing and absolutely not for kids or even teens, but if you (an adult) enjoy feeling creeped out for a good long while, rent this one. And I'd still like to find the original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I prefer this version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems like I'm alone in my opinion but I preferred the American remake. Let me start by saying I didn't realize it was a remake. Maybe this is why I have more respect for it. I watched this film when it first came out in 93 and thoroughly enjoyed it. I thought it was chilling, it hit all the right notes and kept me on the edge of my seat.Scary stuff! Another commenter wrote this film unlike the original is easily forgettable. Not true. I've always remembered this film and have watched it numerous times. A few days ago I learned this film wasn't the original. I watched the original today and can't see what all the fuss is about. Yes it was good but It's about 95% the same so I'm confused by all the dislikes of this remake. Yes they had different endings but the ending of the American version did not ruin the film in my opinion. It was just different. I thought Jeff Bridges was a more convincing psycho then the original. I also thought keifer Sutherland was a more convincing boyfriend too. Then there's also the bonus of not having to read subtitles.. Yes next time i want to watch this movie again it will definitely be this version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jeff Bridges And Kiefer Sutherland Are Both Extremely Good In This</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Right off I was drawn into this picture by the performances from both Jeff Bridges and Kiefer Sutherland. Bridges appears first, and he captures the attention right away. He's off; something's not quite right about him. You know going in that the story revolves around a man obsessed with the search for his missing girlfriend. As you watch Bridges play Barney, you're left wondering right away - is he the guy looking for the girlfriend, or is he the guy who kidnapped the girlfriend. You wonder that, because you know that the other lead actor in this (although he's not yet been introduced) is Kiefer Sutherland as Jeff - who often (especially at this relatively early stage of his career) played fairly menacing characters. So there's a question right off. But the roles are the reverse of what you expect. Barney is "off" - and frighteningly so.Jeff and his girlfriend Diane (an early role for Sandra Bullock, and a limited performance, restricted to the first third of the movie if that) stop at a convenience store while on a trip. She goes in to use the restroom and buy some beer. And she never comes out. Or, at least, she never comes back to Jeff. And Jeff becomes obsessed. Sutherland was superb. In this he's not a menacing character. He's completely vulnerable - haunted by Diane's disappearance, not able to move on. His vulnerability increases as the picture goes on, to the actually uncomfortable moment at which he finally breaks down when he gets the chance to confront Barney about what happened to Diane. It was an out of character performance for Sutherland, who was fantastic.The movie is really his story of obsession. The mystery of Diane's disappearance is somewhat secondary, but it is the engine that drives the character of Jeff, and - like him - the viewer also wants to know what exactly happened to her. Admittedly, there were times when this movie seemed to drag the story out a bit; times when it seemed to be getting unnecessarily long. And yet - that probably helped the viewer (or me at least) get into Jeff's head a bit. This never-ending nightmare that he wants to get to the end of but that keeps going on. That's not really a criticism of the movie. It's interesting the whole way through. It's just an acknowledgement that at times the story was somewhat slow- paced.After three years, the character of Rita comes into the picture as Jeff's new love interest. Rita was played by Nancy Travis. I have to admit that, for me, Rita was the weakest character of the movie. She came across to me as either unbelievable or unforgivable - and maybe a combination of both. I just found it hard to sympathize with her frustration over Jeff's inability to move on. She knew the story when she entered the relationship. If the woman I loved had suddenly disappeared with no clues and no trace, I might be able to move on and start a new life - as Jeff did - but I'd also be haunted by the question of what happened and I'd likely never stop looking for answers. Rita couldn't understand that? That didn't work for me. I didn't care much for the character. Of course, she does turn out to be the hero in the end - and her heroism is the thing that finally puts Jeff's demons to rest - but through most of the movie I just didn't like the character.The revelation of what happened to Diane (which does come as the movie approaches its end) is horrible; the stuff of nightmares. The movie ends on a sort of happy note, with Barney dealt with and the mystery solved for Jeff. It's a good movie. It is a bit slow paced at times, but it's driven (and driven well) by Bridges and Sutherland, who were both extremely good. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Thriller for Novices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland and Sandra Bullock play young lovers out for a vacation. They stop at a service station, she goes in to get some drinks . . . and never comes out.Years later, though Sutherland's character has a formidable new girlfriend in Nancy Travis, he is still obsessed with finding out what happened to his old girlfriend. And as he and his new girlfriend piece together the clues to the vanished Bullock, they find their curiosity leading to . . .But that would be telling.For anyone unfamiliar with the ending, this movie will keep you watching to the very last scenes. Like Sutherland's bewildered boyfriend, the viewer will be obsessed with knowing the answer of how a full-grown woman can vanish off the face of the earth without leaving a trace.If you read other reviews, forget the ones that hype "the original." When I first caught this on television I didn't know there was an original, and it kept me and the woman I was with on the edge of our seats. And though I'm pretty good at guessing endings, this one ended with a wallop I had not foreseen.Unfortunately, it's only worth watching once. The performances are all great, and the fact that Sandra Bullock has star power fuels the speculation that she may still be alive but hiding for some reason. Yet the movie relies heavily on full-throttle suspense, and once you have all the answers that is gone. So enjoy it while it lasts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't see the original version of this movie, so I'm making no comparisons. First minutes made me think it was gonna be something like "Arachnophobia" part II, but happily it was just a terrifying scene hahaha. The way filmmakers chose to tell this story was well done; we have two different stories that eventually connect. Jeff Bridges has a totally sick character that scares us every time he's on scene; directing uses some scary background sound to turn every scene into a suspense. There's a moment in this film that I don't know if Barney is a murder or there's going to be another bad guy in the story. However, when Jeff wakes up in that coffin, I had a big surprise that I couldn't ever possibly imagine; I didn't know that burying people alive was used in movies in that decade. Unfortunately, in the end the murder dies, something I didn't expect for, since he did everything so right to that point. All in all, it's a great and extremely original story that will surely surprise you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Implausible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS.I wish I could recommend this but I can't. It's an unfocused love story, an unfocused mystery, and an unfocused thriller. (It's pretty unfocused.)The movie begins as a mystery, more or less, with Sandra Bullock disappearing from a sunny Quckstop at a freeway pull off. Briefly, Sutherland spends the next three years mooning over her absence, although he is quickly picked up, seduced, and roommated by an aggressive waitress (Travis) he runs into during his long dismal search for Bullock. Sutherland does everything he can to publicize Bullock's disappearance and eventually Jeff Bridges, the man responsible for the incident, appears and reveals himself. Keefer immediately and understandably pounds him to a pulp. "Excuse me, are you finished?" asks a bloody Bridges from the asphalt. Bridges is willing to show Sutherland what happened to Bullock, but only if Sutherland is willing to go through exactly what Bullock did, beginning with a cup of hot drugged coffee. In an excess of trust, Keefer drinks the potient, only to wake up buried alive inside a pine box. (Well -- really.) Travis, a gutsy woman, manages to find out what's happened and, even though she has dissolved her relationship with Keefer, rescues him anyway. The ending is complicated and tricky. There are chases through the night-time woods, chloroformed women wielding protective knives against an assailant -- "Really," Bridges tells the still doped-up Travis, "You're in no condition for slicing." A gun falls into the mud, wrenched out of a woman's hands. A knife falls into the mud, ditto. Travis has her face pushed into the mud. Bridges gets his head knocked plumb to squash with a shovel, to paraphrase a much better movie.The reason I wish I could recommend this is that the script needn't have been so poorly cobbled together. The feistiness that Travis shows early in the film and, periodically throughout, is needed desperately at the end. ("I come from a family of fighters!" she tells Sutherland at one point.) How many movies can you name in which the helpless victim, buried alive and gasping for air under the muddy soil of a rainforest, turns out to be a MAN -- and rescued by a WOMAN? That is, some thought obviously went into continuity of character. Pitifully little into how well or with how much logic the plot hangs together.There are also the performances. Lisa Eichorn has only a tiny part, but she's a fine actress. Keefer Sutherland looks chubby and uncertain and hardly up to clobbering the hulking villain. Sandra Bullock is cute and competent. Travis demonstrates her range too. Compare her performance here as the willful heroine with her performance as an entirely different character, a quietly elegant one, in "Internal Affairs." And Jeff Bridges, as usual, brings something unique to his role as the quiet and well-behaved family man. The script betrays him at times. Explaining why he was unable to kidnap his first victim, he says something that sounds like it came straight out of an ambitious high school freshman's attempt at a short story -- "I discovered that the target didn't have to be stronger, but that I needed to be weaker." (Huh?)But, wow, does Bridges invest his role with individuality. He speaks in a wispy half-whining accent that sounds vaguely Scandinavian. After he gets socked in the jaw by Sutherland he spends the rest of the movie tonguing his battered lip and teeth, without making it obvious. Even his walk is unique. An unquiet shambling slow roll.It's too bad, with this amount of talent on display, the vessel proved so unworthy.</fullReview>

What a waste of time it was watching this US remake...If you have a choice, please skip "The Vanishing" and watch the Dutch original "Spoorloos". The suspense is very well built-up. You feel the frustration of Rex, in search of any trace of what might have happened to his girlfriend Saskia, after she entered a gas-station and never returned to his car. The search takes him three years, and when he finally gets in touch with the person who knows the truth about what happened to Saskia, he must agree to undergo the same thing that Saskia has undergone. The ending leaves you speechless in your chair....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A couple are split apart during a vacation. Early scenes lead us to believe Barney, Jeff Bridges' character, has kidnapped the girl in an unexplained but premeditated abduction. The film plays out some years later where, despite a new love interest, Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) is determined to solve her disappearance.The storyline is definitely intriguing but there have been some really bad decisions made during the making of this film, culminating a pretty shoddy piece of work.OK here we go. The abduction scene - aside from two major continuity errors there is a point where Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland are made to perform a little signed-pet-love-ritual that's drowned in over-sentimentality to the point of nausea. We know they're in love; the "I do solemnly swear never to leave you" speech only moments prior was ample thank you. Jeff Bridges' robot accent is another example. What is that for? Starman is back and it seems after a decade on the planet, he's turned nasty. The entire plot is then able to be resolved by the introduction of a needless character who, by a rather fortunate twist of fate, has quite miraculous powers of observation. The climactic sequence itself has essentially been done before only much, much better. It's riddled with further annoyances and another blinding continuity blunder. I could go on but something positive needs to be said. At a stretch, Kiefer Sutherland is the only one to save face with a fairly decent performance.The 1988 original of the same name (changed from the Dutch title 'Spoorloos' for English speaking audiences) was recommended to me, only for an online rental company to send me this later Hollywood version by mistake. I was surprised to find both having been Directed by George Sluizer and would be interested to know his motivation for the remake. I am reliably and thankfully informed it is of a much higher quality in all areas including plot. Horah for that, but it really doesn't take much doing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never saw the Dutch original, but this one SUCKS on its own merit!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Man, what an awful film. As with many terrible films, the structure of its awfulness lies in the script. This is such a pathetic attempt at a psychological thriller that it gives the entire genre a bad name. Okay, here's one major problem: Sandra Bullock's character is abducted by Jeff Bridges in his car at a busy convenience store in broad daylight. Somehow, her boyfriend Kiefer Sutherland doesn't find a single witness to this act and subsequently spends most of the movie completely clueless as to her whereabouts. Come on! Personally, I find this completely insulting to even the dimmest of audience members. Yet we are forced to buy into this nonsense. Of equal frustration is the poorly explained motive for Jeff Bridges's actions. His character is a bit of an eccentric academic, to be sure, but far from the sociopath who would do these things. He goes through about ten minutes, give or take, spilling his beans to Sutherland as to why he has performed his cruel actions. But the explanation itself lacks even the most elementary sense of logic. Therefore, no intelligent audience member can really believe in the possibility of his evil. And if you subtract that element from the story, the entire thing falls apart.Also of major concern: -Jeff Bridges using a weird, pseudo-French accent for no reason.-The entire boring subplot involving Nancy Travis, most especially her saving the day by turning the tables on Bridges.-The crazy woman who somehow manages to remember Jeff Bridges' license plate number despite also thinking that the Lucky Charms leprechaun is real.-Sandra Bullock's character's name, Diane Shaver, conveniently re-scrambles to form the word "vanished". Are you friggin' kidding me?? -The logistical impossibility of drugging, abducting, and burying (in a very remote location) a human being within the span of forty minutes (as Bridges specifically alludes to).This is a movie that made me remember the fictional, impossibly stupid (yet very successful) Donald Kaufman character in Adaptation. Many screenwriters are brilliant, inspired artists. Some are just bozos who convince the nitwits running the studios to make their drivel. This particular script is so stunningly dimwitted that Donald Kaufman himself would have managed to sell it. Unfortunately for all of us in the real world, Todd Graff actually did.</fullReview>

I have also seen the original and like it very much, however I totally disagree calling the American version as pure s***. I think The Vanishing is as good as the original or even better, especially Jeff Bridges as Barney is incredible which alone makes it worth to watch this movie. And there are quiet many people who agree to me and think that this a good thriller, for sure not perfect but very exciting, all in all intelligent and interesting. To those of you who permanently try to compare it to "Spoorlos" and who seem to be so disappointed I can only say, what did you expect? How could George Sluizer make you feel satisfied when he directed "The Vanishing" in 1993? I would agree; it's a typical Hollywood thriller but it's a good one; if you tried to regard it more individually I would suppose you to agree. I mean I only think it's a pity that those who haven't seen this movie and might be interested to watch it get such an underrated opinion of it just because some of you are showing their personal disgust to Hollywood remakes in a such a low way. I also use to enjoy Europeen cinema very much. Generally prefer it to so called blockbusters from Hollywood. But this remake is great and deserves a better vote. I give it a 9 and at least some of those who watched this movie should agree. Everyone who is able to comment movies without prejudices should be able to diversify "The Vanishing" from real crap giving it at least a 5 or a 6 even if he or she doesn't like it so very much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Kiefer Sutherland may be in the lead role but without a doubt The Vanishing is Jeff Bridges's movie.Bridges plays a sinister, shy mad professor with such intensity and belief that all the other characters pale into insignificance in comparison. Sutherland, Sandra Bullock and Nancy Travis all come across as a bit dull.The Vanishing is unusual in that while Jeff, the central character (played by Sutherland), knows nothing of why and how his girlfriend Diane went missing, we know exactly who did it from the start - Barney, played by Bridges. It makes it harder to emotionally invest in Jeff's search for her.But what we don't know is what Barney did to Diane after he took her. So when Barney and Jeff finally meet, and this begins to be revealed, the movie shifts up several gears. It becomes an edge-of-the-seat thriller as the characters race against time to either kill or save each other.This end sequence makes the movie a success.</fullReview>

Sure, you have the same director (a nice touch), but it seems some small concessions could have been made. Bridges did not have to be European. Or, if you wanted a European, perhaps one could have been cast (though I suppose the idea was to get a bigger name).All in all, though it is not as dark or as powerful as the original, it still makes for a good film. Bridges shines, and it may stand as one of the strangest abduction stories ever told.</fullReview>

Jeff continues to search with no success. Roadside diner waitress Rita Baker (Nancy Travis) befriends Jeff and becomes his girlfriend. After 3 years, Jeff's search has broken his relationship with Rita. Barney sees Jeff on TV and decides to contact him with a devilish offer.This is the poster child of an American remake being unfaithful to its foreign language original. The original is thoroughly European zeroing in on the despair and the blandness of evil. This version tacks on an American action thriller ending. It takes the original and destroys its intent. Even as a movie on its own, this still has many problems. Jeff Bridges is trying too hard. He doesn't have to have the droopy hair. He looks silly. If they're flipping the movie into a thriller, most of his preparation scenes are pointless. They don't add intensity. In fact, Barney should be turned into a darker character if that's where the movie is going.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid thriller more interesting than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like other reviews I read I thought this film was under-appreciated and while I didn't think it was great it was solid nevertheless. I actually preferred this film over the original as I thought the original lacked suspense and with this version I thought Jeff Bridges was terrific in his role as a quiet psychopath as well was Kiefer Sutherland trying to find out what happened to his wife. The film has an uneasy mood about it while watching it and actually does feel chilling at times which I didn't get out of the original and I liked it how this version has a different end to the original which some viewers complained about though I quite enjoyed it, you also get to see a young Sandra Bullock before she appeared in Speed who looks sexy and sweet as usual.</fullReview>

What would you do if - after your wife (or child) disappeared - a man turned up to say "You have a chance to experience what she experienced"? Would your response be: "Look man - she is dead anyway - why don't you make sure you kill me exactly the same way." Or, to quote from Pulp Fiction: "I am going to get medieval on your ass.."Both movies have dumb characters who lend a new meaning to the saying: "Curiosity killed the cat."</fullReview>

A hideous object lesson to all students.An almost perfect example of how a masterpiece has to be dumbed down to that mythical audience-the American lowest common denominator.Unwittingly, it insults even that perceived audience.A good example also of how a usually good actor (Jeff Bridges) wildly misjudges and delivers what the industry knows as a "dog".But the greatest sadness to all this is that this horror (forgive the pun) is perpetrated by the original director! Why? What motivated him into committing this to film? One of the most bizarre and disappointing recent experiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love the book, I hate the movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You could hardly even say this movie was written by Tim Krabbé, because the movie is only loosely inspired by the book, so it seems. The original title was "Het gouden ei" or "The golden egg". The reason why this wasn't literally translated is because all references to a golden egg quite have quite simply disappeared. And that was what made the book so great. That's one great minus.Also, Jeff's character does not resemble the one in the book either. In the book he is desperate to know what happened to Diane, just because his ignorance is killing him. Not because he wants her to be still alive. He's not in love with Denise either, sure he likes her, but not as much as is displayed in the movie. In the book, Denise has a minor part. Another minus.Also, the movie represents the killer as some sick psycho. OK, in the book you can't really say he's normal either, but the movie really takes his character over the line.Then, the thing I hated most. The last twenty minutes of the movie quite simply do not exist in the book. It ends with Jeff waking up inside a coffin, praying he will die soon and glad he knows what exactly happened to Diane. So, Denise will never know what happened to him, the murderer does not end up getting killed and Jeff most certainly doesn't survive. In short, there is no typical American happy ending.The only thing I liked about this movie, was Jeff Bridges acting. He has an amazing way of presenting the murderer's way of thinking and acting. A great actor.My advise for those who haven't seen the movie yet. If you have a choice, read the book rather than watching the movie. You won't get your sweet happy ending, but you won't feel as empty.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so Thrilling Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Have to say I have never seen the original Dutch "The Vanishing" which seems to get much better reviews and is rated a lot higher than this. This US version is apparently gorier and has a happy ending (unlike the original) but I don't see why it should, both the films are directed by the same person, George Sluizer, who shouldn't have changed a winning formula.Anyway for me this wasn't a very good film, it is classed as a thriller but their wasn't really anything thrilling about it. It was slow at the beginning and never really got going after that. It has some really good actors in it (The normally reliable Jeff Bridges, 24's Kiefer Sutherland) and that's why i picked it up to start with but they don't add anything much to the film (in fact Jeff Bridges character seems oddly over the top).Watch the original instead** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Vanishing (1993) starts off as two different stories: Preparations for a kid- napping on Barney Cousin´s behalf (Bridges) and a road trip, in which Diane Shaver (Bullock) and Jeff Harriman (Sutherland) drive to Mt. St. Helens together. By coincidence they meet at a gas station and that is where the mess begins: Diane vanishes. Albeit the viewers confusion about what happened (this is not reveiled until the last third of the movie), one instantly assumes a connection to Barney´s evil preparations...yawnCasting Bridges to play Barney was an interesting move, but does not support the character of the book very well. He is, simply spoken, boring in his portrayal of the ambiguos and psychotic chemistry professor. Fortunately, Bullock´s even lesser significant performance as Sutherland´s annoyingly bitchy girl-friend comes to a quick end and the audience can finally focus on the over-elaborate unfolding of the murder-revelation. Feel free to fast-forward.The technique of hiding essential information from the audience in order to create suspense is not new. Since the story is based on the same book which inspired the 1988 original "Spoorloos" directed by George Sluizer, I would strongly recommend to watch that one instead. It´s equally predictable, but it IS the original and does not yield the common criticism of a giant Hollywood picture - it´s from a film political point of view much more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch it for Jeff Bridges!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of a 1988 Franco-Dutch film, also directed by George Sluizer, 'The Vanishing' does deliver some thrills &amp; an unbelievably menacing performance by Academy-Award-Winning Acting Legend, Jeff Bridges. One of THE Most Versatile Actors in History, Bridges proves his status yet again by playing a loathsome villain with such intensity. 'The Vanishing' Synopsis: The boyfriend of an abducted woman never gives up the search as the abductor looks on.'The Vanishing' is interesting in parts. The film begins well, it has moments that genuinely arrest. However, the last 20-25 minutes don't leave much of an impact. The finale, especially, needed to be stronger &amp; far more superior. Todd Graff's Screenplay does work, but falls deeply in the last half-hour. George Sluizer's Direction is absorbing. Cinematography &amp; Editing, are worth a mention.Performance-Wise: Obviously, Bridges rules the show with an unbelievably menacing performance. The actor plays the loathsome villain with great intensity &amp; unpredictability. It's a character that you love to hate, and Bridges makes him exactly that. This performance clearly proves what a Magical &amp; Versatile Actor Bridges is. Kiefer Sutherland delivers a sincere performance. Nancy Travis fills the bill. Sandra Bullock does well in a cameo.On the whole, 'The Vanishing' is a decent thriller. Watch it Bridges!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was rather interesting and I really wanted to see how it played out. However, it is not really a movie that I wish to see again as now that I know where the movie is going I just do not see the need to go there again. Granted, I read a review that talked about the Dutch film this one was based off of and I kind of want to see it now as from what I read it ends in a different way. This one is about a couple who are having a nice drive and one of them vanishes. The gal disappears after the two have a little spat, but the guy ends up feeling bad and after she is gone he is obsessed with finding her years after her disappearance took place. Well the kidnapper basically is keeping tabs on him and when he finds a new love and stops putting up the missing posters this guy seems somewhat upset about this and decides it is time to introduce himself to the man he left broken. The cast is great as Sutherland plays the man who lost his gal and is in very bad shape really well and Bridges plays the guy who is the cause of it very well. He just is a man who is very strange, it is hard to pinpoint his reasons for doing what he did even after he explains them. Sandra Bullock is okay in the brief time she is in the film and Rita Travis plays the woman who Sutherland's character starts a new romance with. Still, it just is a movie that you only have to see once.</fullReview>

The fact, that the basic premise of this movie, is creepier than a thousand NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREETS is what keeps it watchable. Maybe because the same director, made both versions, is why a different (happier) ending was tacked on, i mean, he surely couldn't get away with the same 'shock' ending twice, could he? ********SPOILERS******** The only thing that ruined it for me, was the twee joke tacked on at the end, about the waiter bringing the (now smiling) couple coffee.Needless, to say, this is still a good movie, and at least the killer didn't rise up again at the end, because for a long lingering while, it looked like he was going to. **********END OF SPOILERS**************All the cast are very good, (even BULLOCK, and i can't stand her!) but on the whole i would advise those to seek the original first!A good attempt, 7 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Most American remakes of European films are pretty poor, but this is in a league of its own. In fact this might even be the worst (Sandra Bullock) movie ever made. I daresay I might have passed it off as just another innocuously bad Hollywood thriller had I not seen the Dutch original, SPOORLOOS. The altered ending here is stupid enough (and executed with particular ineptitude), but a far worse crime than that is removing all the intelligence and depth of character that marked out the original as a classic. The real horror to be found here is in the fact that the same man who directed SPOORLOOS is responsible for this atrocity. Will the real George Sluizer please stand up?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They should pay you to sit through this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason one might want to see this film is to try and analyse why this is so much worse than the Dutch original. Most copies such as Point of No Return (La Femme Nikita) with Bridget Fonda fail because they lack the freshness of the original. (The I've Seen It syndrome.) Yet, most versions of Beau Geste or The Three Musketeers are as enjoyable as their predecessors. Changing the story or the ending should not affect the enjoyment of a mystery film. The point is that one should not be able to guess the ending. The plot, acting, development, lighting, action, etc. should not be predictable. The viewer should be kept in suspense until the very end. The real danger as in this case is that the film doesn't make much sense when the story and ending are changed. If you were to view both films (not knowing which came first), you would likely guess that the Dutch film was the copy since the story line etc. are so improved.The original has its flaws, but seems absolutely brilliant compared to this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Dutchman I'm ashamed to say I haven't seen the original 'Spoorloos' yet (nor have I read 'The Golden Egg'), but I sure hope it's better than this American re-make.While buying some beer, Diane (Sandra Bullock) is kidnapped by Barney (Jeff Bridges), leaving boyfriend Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) left in despair. Years later we still find Jeff hanging up posters of her, wanting to know what happened to her.When finally another woman comes in his life (Nancy Travis) he can let go a little bit. But this is exactly what psycho Barney did not want to happen. So the two guys meet...So far, this all sounds pretty interesting, and it is. It's a bit of a different thriller, as we already know who the kidnapper is, but it all works out pretty well. Up until this point, that is...Because somehow the last 30 minutes the movie changes from an intelligent kinda thriller into the slash and hack formula of your basic teen thriller. It kinda reminded me to the distorted ending of 'Don't Say A Word'.It makes this movie not that credible and below average in my opinion, in particular since Bridges (an otherwise fine actor) is not at his best here. 4/10.</fullReview>

Bullock disappears and Sutherland spends the next few years trying to find her.Basically what we have here is your basic psycho thriller enlivened by Bridges performance as Barney - a part pathetic part pure evil character that borders on the comic, making him all too real and chilling (he even laughs at himself when he botches a kidnapping).Like The Sixth Sense, the pay-off is what it's all about and when you find out what happened to Bullocks' sweet and naive girl-next-door chances are you won't forget it in a hurry.Sometimes silly (the joke at the end is plain stupid), The Vanishing has a nasty bluntness about human evil to it that you don't usually find in this genre.

I do like the original ending of The Vanishing, but with this version, the ending they used worked with that version. Jeff Bridges goes from sympathetic(you actually like the guy) to scary, Keifer Sutherland does a great job playing a normal guy strung out on too much coffee, but the real star is Nancy Travis. Her no B.S. attitude really plays well and she does it with such percision that she actually steals the movie. This is the movie that shows how well she can act.

The American remake of the European original based on the best selling Dutch novel, this 1993 version of the account is as suspenseful and nerve-wracking as its inspiration.With Bridges turn as the sleazy subjugator being one of the film's many highlights.However, sometimes when your girlfriend disappears, it just means you've been dumped.Yellow Light</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw that this was starring the Dude (Bridges) and it was on Netflix streaming so I thought I would check it out. Not the greatest decision I have ever made but far from the worst. Also my beautiful wife had seen this back in 1993 and lied to me saying it was good. I had several problems with the film as I will detail below.The plot consists of Jeff (Sutherland) looking for his missing girlfriend Diane (Bullock) who vanished on a vacation trip three years prior. Barney (Bridges) plays the creepy villain in this tale with Rita (Travis) as Jeff's new girlfriend rounding out the cast. We are introduced to a dedicated and obsessive Jeff who has not stopped searching for his missing girlfriend for 3 years. His obsession/dedication to Diane is hurting his relationship with his current live in girlfriend Rita. Rita's attempts to make Jeff give up his search spurs Barney back into action. There were some slightly suspenseful moments in this film and it had some moments of mild tension. Sutherland played a mildly entertaining obsessive compulsive and Travis's portrayal of a tough as nails diner waitress was something straight out of a Mel's Diner episode. Strangely the actor I had the most problems with was Bridges and his depiction of the weirdo Barney. I thought the mannerisms and accent that he used were hackneyed at best. I was expecting a lot more from the Dude. Also thought that the plot was pretty lame and overdone in some sections. Overall, this film was just barely watchable. I have heard it was a remake of the film Spoorloss (1988) that was very well received. This film has the same director so I am not sure how they managed to screw the pooch on this remake. Unless, I lay all the blame on the addition of screen writer Todd Graff who was not involved with the first project and was just added in to ruin the movie and make it more Hollywood. There are a few points in the film that caused me to laugh out loud but I don't think they were shooting to make a comedy. If you never watched this film I don't think your life would be any less complete.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a film that lasts two hours, very little worth notice happens within that time. The result is an OK but cliche drenched low budget thriller. The performances are standard, the best being from Jeff Bridges as the eerie killer. There's also some minor overacting from Nancy Travis and an absolutely wasted part for Sandra Bullock. Nonetheless the film is also tense and engaging, even if it does take a while to get to the point. It is quite clever in parts and even a bit funny. It would have been better had it not been for its cheap and un-rewarding finish. Perhaps a better stage and a more carefully devised script would have helped. It's alright but this genre has been done much better in other films. "The Vanishing" is only barely average. My IMDb rating: 5.0/10.</fullReview>

The end is good, but I still think it is really overrated on these pages ! Still it's interesting, from a french point of view, to see that Bernard-Pierre Donnadieu can do on this job as he's a quite underrated actor in France.

		<fullReview>This film started out as promising and had a very few tense moments, but the stupidity of the characters really irritated me more than anything else. I lost count how many times people got into strangers' cars in this movie ! Four? Five? My husband and I were watching this, yelling at the television "Come on!". And the ending ! If two people really went through what these people did, I HIGHLY doubt they would EVER be laughing about it at the end. I couldn't believe it. Do not waste your time on this. The characters are foolish and dull, the plot has many loose ends, and the ending was LUDICROUS !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-conceived drama that becomes a big let-down in the final act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is relatively easy to have a good idea for a movie, and to develop that idea, but pulling everything together into a good ending is far more difficult. This version of 'The Vanishing' is a good example of the latter, where our attention is held all the way, only to be sadly disappointed with the ending. Sandra Bullock and Kiefer Sutherland make a cute couple, driving around the Pacific Northwest with bicycles on the roof of the car. Jeff Bridges breaks out of his usual characterizations and plays a Chemistry professor with a slight foreign (French?) accent who feels he must prove to himself that he is capable of evil, to balance out his daughter's perception of him as a hero. So the whole story examines the younger man's obsession of finding out the details of why his girlfriend disappeared at the gas station, and the older man's obsession with doing something sinister. This is, by all written accounts, an inferior remake of the Dutch movie, 'Spoorloos' (1988), and my next quest is to find a copy of that movie and view it.SPOILERS follow, please quit reading NOW!!The professor used chloroform to subdue his victim. After 3+ years of the boyfriend's hunting for her, including posters, the prof sends a card telling him to meet and he will find out what he wants to know. He makes him drink coffee with a sedative 'so that you will know exactly what happened to her.' Then he is buried in a pine box, and left to die, presumably what had happened 3+ years earlier to his girlfriend. New girlfriend figures out where they are (at the old camp), fights the prof, digs up her boyfriend, who then kills the prof with a shovel into the mouth. The whole final act is disingenuous. I rate it 5 of 10 for some good suspense but not overall a satisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Without reverting to comparisons with the original, 'The Vanishing' is worth sticking with, despite it's derivative ending. Well, what do you expect from a 'Hollywood' movie? Everything that comes out of that place is devoid of any originality! Still, at least the story in itself is enough to give this movie a slight edge. Unfortunately Jeff Bridges has a ridiculous accent, and isn't very scary at all, and the finale is a big bunch of cliches. All too melodramatic, but it does have it's moments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overly long and boring remake of director George Sluizer's earlier film of the same name. Kiefer Sutherland stars as a man obsessed with finding his missing girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, in a short role). Jeff Bridges is the crazed man who kidnapped and killed her for unknown reasons. Now they get involved in a strange chess match which may result in Sutherland's demise as well. Nancy Travis is also along as the new girlfriend who cannot shake the ghost of Bullock. The film is just not sure where it wants to go. The direction is slow, annoying, and unspectacular. The screenplay is fuzzy, it never does make as much sense as it should. "The Vanishing" is a strange film that plays more like a disjointed dream than a motion picture. In the end you will be lucky if you have not fallen asleep with this yawner. 2 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In order for a movie to get at least 6/10 in my book, I must enjoy watching it over and over again. The dramatic impact of The Vanishing is there only for the first time; after that it is boring and uninspiring. For a movie like this, not boosted by any special effects or memorable scenery, the acting must be superb in order for it to be above average. Acting is not bad, and is much better than in movies I give higher rating, but is not good enough to make this film worth the effort. I also get tired by all those psychotic characters that get off on making an amusing death for their victims. All in all, The Vanishing is a boring movie which gets 4/10.</fullReview>

I couldn't bring myself to care about any of the characters. The dialog is cheesy. Several moments in the movie actually made me groan out loud (including Kiefer Southerland's crazy neighbor and the incredibly lame joke that ends the movie). Jeff Bridges' accent is goofy - I can't tell what country he's supposed to be from. It has to be one of the least thrilling thrillers I've ever seen as well...after Sandra Bullock's character disappears, absolutely nothing happens to advance the story for a good 45 minutes. I would give this movie a negative amount of stars if I could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The utterly ridicules and convoluted up-beat ending buries the movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(There are Spoilers) The movie "The Vanishing" starts out interesting enough with couple Jeff &amp; Diane, Kifer Sutherland &amp; Sandra Bullock, driving in the Pacific North West on vacation where Diane later ends up missing when they stop at a highway rest-stop to get gas. Diane going into the food-mart to get bottles of beer and soda is never seen again and Jeff hysterical at her disappearance makes it his life's work to find her. It's now three years later and still no word of where she is and what happened to Diane Jeff is down and out looking like a bum when he literally drops, from lack of sleep, in a local diner having a glass of milk.The waitress Rita, Nancy Travis, at first takes a liking towards him the later falls in love with the haggard but good-looking and sensitive Jeff who she finds a place to spend the night in the back of the diner.We then learn that Jeff has been looking all over the Seattle area for Diane the last three years postings thousands of missing person posters and appearing on local TV and radio talk-shows. Pleading to anyone in the vast media audience if they have any information of Diane whereabouts.It's not a total mystery to what happened to Diane since for the first ten or so minutes of he movie we see this grinning and smiling weirdo Barney Cousins, Jeff Bidiges,at his secret cottage by the lake talking to himself and trying to memorize corny pick-up lines in Berney sharpening his ability to induce women to go into his station wagon and then have them kidnapped. We then see Barney bumbling around the store and gas station,unsuccessfully trying to pick on a woman, just before Diane disappeared. Living together Rita gets a bit upset with her new boyfriend Jeff's obsession with the now long departed Diane and Jeff, to keep Rita from leaving him, tells her that his relationship with Diane is now history. But it's Barney who now gets into the act sending Jeff a letter with information that only he and Diane knew. Barney even has Diane's car-keys that get's Jeff more interested then ever in Diane's plight but it just about destroyers his attachment with Rita.Walking out on Jeff Rita just misses running into Barney as he sneaks into and hides in their apartment in order to make Jeff an offer that he can't refuse to find out what happened to Diane. Jeff later finds Rita gone and then is confronted by the strange and what seems like sleep deprived and drugged out, you just gotta hear how this guy talks, Berney and his evidence, Diane's car-keys, to what happened to Diane. Jeff has a fit and beats and kicks Barney down three flights of stairs almost kicking out his teeth with the poor man ending up almost unconscious on the pavement. With Jeff regaining his composure and Barney getting back on his feet, minus a few teeth, he offers Jeff the opportunity of a lifetime to find out just what happened to Diane. But to find that out he'll have to take a long ride with him back to some deserted gas station outside of Seattle. The movie now begins to go off the deep end together with, if he isn't already, the insane Barney where Rita who just threw Jeff out of her life forever gets involved in finding him to the point where she puts her life on the line. As for Berney's weird obsession with Jeff it's later revealed by him that he's into some kind of secret experiment, Berney is a professor of chemistry at the local collage,that he's been conducting since he was 15 about the forces of good and evil existing in all of us. Jeff going along with Barney's strange scenario of going through what Diane's went through before she disappeared drinks a cup of spiked coffee, that Berney cooked up, that knocks Jeff out cold. When he wakes up finds himself six feet under in a coffin that Barney prepared for him; was that what happened to Diane three years ago?Instead of ending the movie right there with Jeff finding out what happened to Diane, like in the original and far better Dutch version of the movie "The Vanishing", we instead have Rita coming to his rescue and battling it out with the crazy Barney. By now Barney seems to not only be nuts but also a glutton for punishment getting the hell beat out of him, not to mention the battering that he earlier took from Jeff, by the much smaller and lighter Rita. He's also tricked into letting Rita go by her blackmailing Barney into thinking that she has Barney's 13 year-old daughter Maggy ,Denise Cousins.Nothing made sense including how Jeff could have possibly survived being buried for what seemed like over an hour without suffocating to death and just how did Rita know were Jeff was buried? The camera and Rita kept focusing on Barneys muddy boots and shovel as if that was supposed to be a clue to where Jeff was buried? Barney gets exactly what's coming to him when Jeff is dug up and comes back to life attacking Barney with a shovel splitting his face in two with Rita giving him a hand as well with a floor board over Berney's head. The movie ends with both Jeff and Rita in a Seattle restaurant negotiating a book deal about their ordeal as their served coffee, a brew that was the cause of most of their troubles, which they respectfully turn down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a huge disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer's remake of his own - superior - film is a complete waste of time. Why was it even attempted? Kiefer Sutherland plays Jeff Harriman, whose girlfriend (Sandra Bullock, who only has a small amount of screen time)is abducted at a service station by Barney Cousins (Jeff Bridges). Now, Barney is portrayed as the kind of guy that no one would trust in a month of Sundays - he lopes about like Frankenstein's Monster but without the sympathy, and Bridges' acting is totally awful. Sutherland comes across a little better when his character turns detective with the help of new love interest Rita Baker (Nancy Travis).A major problem with this version of 'The Vanishing' is its obvious need to cater to Hollywood audiences by avoiding the bleak ending of the original film. Here the ending is happy which seems forced and unbelievable, and completely wrecks the story. However by this time the damage has been done as Jeff Bridges turns the bad guy into a huge laugh.</fullReview>

The original has all the integrity and unpredictability that the story deserves, and this versions throws these virtues out the window for the obligatory Hollywood happy ending that really sucks. If you watch the original, you'll get something as bleak and chilling as Se7en or Memento. With this remake, you get a cheap thriller better compared to The Glass House or Joy Ride. So it depends what you want. Saving the ozone layer is a good idea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Vanishing 1988" tells of the dogged search of a man for his girlfriend who disappears while they're together on holiday. Not a "thriller", this psychodrama spends most of its time dwelling on the criminal mind of the abductor, the anxiety and angst of the abductee's boyfriend, and flashbacking to show what transpired from the abductor's perspective after setting up the story with the boyfriend's perspective. The film is well crafted realism and a worthy watch for those who don't mind subtitles.From the same novel as the later American version (circa 1993), movie purist agree this Europic is superior to the Hollywood product but then, aren't they all?

Of course, the last act is a total studio sellout, but the lead character's obsession which turns his life into a nightmarish carnival of hell is such a strong plot conceit that even Ed Wood couldn't have completely ruined it. That said, it's such a shame that the U.S. film industry continues to spiral into the toilet with foolish remakes of far superior foreign films such as this one, "La Femme Nikita," "Night Watch," and "Open Your Eyes."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director George Sluizer's American remake of his own Dutch-language thriller "Sporloos" from 1988 is a one-idea movie without much of an idea. Young man is obsessed over his missing girlfriend, eventually tracks down her abductor on his own and requests to live through the same terror she did. There's not much logic there--or point--but let it pass. What doesn't pass is the Wonder Woman-like strategies of the man's new girlfriend who comes to the rescue. Elements of "Rambo", "Fatal Attraction", and "Psycho II" are cobbled together with hardly any style. Worse, Sandra Bullock (playing the victim who vanishes) is so bouncy and appealing, we don't want to be without her throughout the duration of this thing. One-box-of-popcorn thriller doesn't have any relation to reality (who keeps framed family photos on the dashboard of their car?), and the main players are only substitutes for characters--in other words, stock figures. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

I cannot say at what point in the story the transition takes place, but I have seen it six times, and it happens each time, regardless of my previously having seen the ending.This is a slick, provocative thriller, which builds awesome suspense, as it takes you into the mind of a psychopath.It rates an 8.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

Instead we were forced to watch Jeff waste all his time living in the past for nothing.Keifer Sutherland was completely forgettable as Jeff.

		<shortDescription>Vanishing and reemergence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Look, I know a lot of people have this thing that says foreign films are always better than the American remakes and they are often correct, but there are those rare occasions where the remake is as good, and sometimes even better then the original. I often see this almost snobbish attitude, and it is truly annoying from those who say that automatically when Hollywood decided to put its own stamp on such films. In this case, "The Vanishing" is just a little better than the Dutch original in my opinion. I watch a lot of movies and not always just the Hollywood product, but what I find different in particularly European film-making is a sort of negative element and a slowness that some people see it as purely "methodical" but I see as downright boring. There are those times when this deliberate slowness works for the film. In both the Dutch and Hollywood version, it works rather well. All of the actors from Jeff Bridges to Kiefer Sutherland do wonderful work here, but the difference in the two (for me at least) is that in this version, the ending is far more satisfying and even thrilling. European filmmakers have a knack for creating down endings, and many times this just plain aggravates me. For me, the mark of a great film is that what I leave the theater I don't feel the need to write my own post ending. This is exactly what I felt after watching the original film. By working very hard here cannot spoil the ending for you. I caught the Hollywood version first on cable, and then follow the Dutch original on Bravo so I didn't have to search the video stores in the foreign film section. Just as some French comedies like "La Cage Au Faux" and "Three Men And A Cradle" were improved upon in their Hollywood counterparts, this too is a prime example of such. In this case, the ending was far more satisfying. I added both versions to my video collection, but this is the one I watch more frequently. However, you may just be one of those people who prefers the foreign products just because to you it is foreign, and therefore more artsy. For me, art is something that not only makes one think, but it is also something that entertains. I guess I'm just the sucker for a happy ending. Nah! A down ending sometimes works. Just not here. But please do see both and make up your own mind. Just try and keep an open mind while doing so.</fullReview>

Also, I wanted them to expand his wife and daughter's realtionships more.The movie really gets going when Jeff and Barney meet. And Like I said I did like the "Hollywood Ending". Worth a rental IMO if it's cheap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK if you haven't seen the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad suspense/mystery movie with a good story and reasonably well-acted. Warning spoilers follow: Unfortunately it has a happy "Hollywood style" ending and I saw the original Dutch/French version (made in about 1976)first. The original is far superior (although if you only speak English the sub-titles are tedious to watch). The original has a chilling ending that gave me nightmares. If you haven't seen the original watch this one - it's worth it. Rating 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very suspenseful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only saw The Vanishing a few days ago on cable and surprised I've never come across it before.The Vanishing reminds me so much of Breakdown, starring Kurt Russell where the movie plods along at a nice speed, nothing over the top happens or anything.Sandra Bullock, although on screen for about 10 minutes is brilliant as Diane, girlfriend of Jeff, played by Kiefer Sutherland. They're on their way home after a holiday and they stop off at a gas station and that's the last time Jeff sees Diane. A few years later, Jeff is determined to find out what happened to Diane and for a first the abductor played brilliantly by Jeff Bridges seeks Jeff out in order to clear his mind of what happened that day 3 years ago.Nancy Travis is in a thankless role as Jeff's new girlfriend Rita, who is jealous of Jeff's determination to find the truth in Diane's disappearance.Kiefer Sutherland is brilliant as Jeff and is in all his work and the movie isn't over the top in the scare factors, there a quite a few scares especially when you find out the truth and that's what makes this movie work the fact that it isn't over the top in scaring the audience.If you haven't seen this movie you certainly don't know what you've been missing, hey it took me 9 years to see it and it's become one of my favourites.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong suspense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am one of those people who prefer not to know the answer to the suspense until the very end. That's why I don't watch "Colombo". The Vanishing kept me unaware and uneasy until the last scene. The suspense is very strong. As for the rest - I believe that it was a nice remake, but it certainly lacked some originality, novelty, so to say. The music is good, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>existentialism in the vanishing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I respect Vberhoef's comments - and must admit that the American critic Roger Ebert shares this criticism, however I disagree. There are a few things here. You have the abductor, his existential confrontation with free will, the husband unable to relinquish his obsession with determining what happened to his wife and the second girl friend, the pragmatist, unwilling to be dominated by events. The clash between them is well-drawn. Both movies attempt to define what such a clash would entail. It's unfair for Roger Ebert to make the stoic criticism that an unhappy ending, unresolved ending is necessary and "organic" to the central theme. Existentialism is only infinite if you happen to view life that way, there are defined endpoints. It is just as clever, just as likely, just as brave to suggest that Barney would bury the husband and continue his random undenied search to define free will and that the husband's obsession would allow him to enter an ill-conceived covenant as it is to think another person would fight back viciously and overpower Barney.The introduction of the Rita character essentially symbolizes that idea. Existentialism doesn't demand as Roger Ebert apparently believes, irresolution, it attempts to define irresolution. It reminds me of the misinterpretation of Thomas Wolfe's "You Can't Go Home Again" It's not that you can't it's that you will continually try to do so...And to the person that said chloroform is not flammable - sorry - any volatile substance is highly explosive, it may not necessarily promote burning but any volatile substance will explode and that pretty much amounts to the same thing. That so many of you who saw the original are so fatalistic to believe only a grim, "realistic" ending is an "uncompromising" ending is truly pathetic. In the "real" world not only would some woman have knocked the wind out of this guy before the chloroform took hold but the police would have solved the case and certainly taken more interest in multiple kidnappings in the same area - thus denying all you fatalists your necessary "grim", "uncompromising" ending. The second film is better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hard to understand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The American remake of the 1988 Dutch film THE VANISHING, about a kidnaping, used the same director but completely revamped the script to include a much more elaborate and absolutely unnecessary happy ending, right down to a dreadfully unfunny punchline delivered by the two leads. One must ask why. By changing the ending and adding characters that were not in the original, the American remake waters the whole thing down and ruins what had been the perfect ending of the original. Also, Keifer Sutherland was cast as the beleaguered hero and Jeff Bridges as the psychotic villain. Anyone see anything wrong here? Obviously, Sutherland would have been a more menacing villain and Bridges a more convincing nebbish of a good guy. As it is, Bridges plays the villain, a man who kidnapped Sutherland's girlfriend years before and now has come back for Sutherland, as a vaguely Dutch-accented loon with bad hair. Bridges has appeared in worse movies, such as the 1970s' remake of KING KONG, but he has never given a worse performance than he does here. He's creepy without being menacing, and you can almost "hear" him acting his little heart out. The film does have a moment or two of suspense, and there's a really funny moment when Bridges assures Sutherland's latest girlfriend, played by the plucky Nancy Travis, that he knows every inch of the woods around his cabin -- and then immediately stumbles. That supremely comic moment had to be intentional. Problem is, the rest of the movie is not a comedy. A young Sandra Bullock plays Sutherland's earlier girlfriend, the one who is kidnapped.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watchable but weird...the plot makes no sense at all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE VANISHING is an odd sort of thriller, made watchable by the tension that's really piled on during the last twenty or so minutes, when JEFF BRIDGES refuses to reveal where he's hidden the body of KIFER SUTHERLAND, whom he has just buried in a wooden crate. Kifer was a man obsessed with finding out just what Bridges did to his missing girlfriend (SANDRA BULLOCK, wasted in a small role).None of the character motivations ever really make sense. No logical explanation is given for the Jeff Bridges character, obviously a psychopath intent on kidnapping and killing his victims. Sutherland's motivations are understandable up to a point--but willing to drink coffee he knows has been drugged in order to repeat what his girlfriend felt (on the premise that only then will Bridges tell him the truth), is a ridiculous tax upon reason.There are so many other problems with the script that it's impossible to go through all of them now. But giving credit where it's due, director George Sluizer does a good job of ratcheting up the suspense for the final moments of conflict between NANCY TRAVIS (Sutherland's current girlfriend) and JEFF BRIDGES, especially those scenes in the cabin and surrounding woods where Bridges has buried Sutherland's body--alive.The improbabilities of the plot are too evident to give the story any credibility. It's based on a previous French/Dutch film by Sluizer made in '88, which some preferred to this remake.Bridges affects a strange accent for no discernible reason, and his performance can't be ranked among his better work.Summing up: Unpleasant story is definitely not for children, too nightmarish in many aspects with lots of graphic violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Vanishing made a bit of a showing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A man faces the man who kidnapped his girlfriend three years earlier. I watched this movie because I was intrigued by the concept. For three years Jeff (Kiefer Sutherland) never gave up looking for his girlfriend Diane (Sandra Bullock). The kidnapper (Jeff Bridges) was so impressed with Jeff's persistence that he decided to reveal himself to him. The movie had some good moments, and I think Jeff Bridges did an excellent job playing a psycho. The overall acting of Kiefer Sutherland and Jeff Bridges helped this movie out a lot. The movie had low points in my opinion. Without giving too much away, I'll just say that intelligence wasn't running rampant in Seattle. The movie was good enough to hold my attention, but had some short falls to make me complain a bit so I have to give it a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start off by saying that I have not seen the original film. That said, I think that The Vanishing is one of the most fascinating, but disturbing, thrillers I've seen. The acting is good in some places and bad in some places. Nancy Travis's character, I thought, was kind of annoying. Kiefer Sutherland is good as the obsessed and grieving boyfriend. But the best performance is Jeff Bridges. I think he stole the show as the psychapathic kidnapper/killer with energy. The fact that there seems to be no motive for his crimes makes him more menacing. The ending, I thought, was a little forged, considering what I've heard about the original vanishing's ending, but all in all, it was a pretty good film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original better be good, with all the talking going on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen Spoorloos and I liked The Vanishing. For the critics here, I suspect it is sort of like the effect where you read a book before seeing a movie--it is hard for the movie to measure up. It must be like that when you see a movie remade in America. I have seen Point of No Return bashed here, too, and it was pretty good. Maybe it is just Anti-Americanism gone rampant. Anyway, The Vanishing definitely had strong performances, suspense, emotion and terror. Those are hardly the ingredients of an awful movie. If they made a few changes to appeal to American audiences, well, it was the same director, so how bad could the changes be? I will see the original, but it better be good, or I will bash it.

		<fullReview>This film is the story of a Seattle man (Kiefer Sutherland) that searches for his kidnapped girlfriend, (Sandra Bullock) for a long time. The circumstances of this disapperance are quite puzzling. I think this movie is very suspenseful, and entertaining. Although typical at times, this film is worth the compromise. If you haven't seen it already, do it now. See the original too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too bad about the ending (possible spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I saw this movie I had already seen the original dutch version. In most ways I think this remake is quite alright. The actors are very good, the suspense is also good. But when I saw the ending of this Hollywood remake, I was so dissappointed. The Dutch movie did not have a happy ending this one does. Why is it that Hollywood doesn't ussually dare to have an ending that might not be happy for the characters but is more satisfying for the audience, because of its surprise? I think the dutch version was better, but despite of the ending this Hollywood remake is not too bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have never seen the original French version of this film you are without a basis for judging this 'Americanized' distortion of the tale. Even so, there are aspects of this fairytale effort that strain credibility. A study of the sociopathic personality (typified by the seemingly endless string of all-too-real cereal killers stalking through the centuries) gives the lie to the character portrayed by Jeff Bridges. Are we to believe that such a sociopath exists that he would kidnap a young woman and then keep her alive and physically healthy for all the years necessary to allow the blatantly contrived happy conclusion we are presented with in this stock formula thriller? See the French original for a glimpse of the mind of a true psychopathic geniuses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Winds up slowly to become disturbing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Sluizer's remake of his own 1988 Dutch/French film starts slowly, but eventually winds up to become a disturbing thriller.The plot involves Jeff Harriman's (Kiefer Sutherland) obsessive search for his girlfriend who disappeared at a roadside stopover three years ago, a search which has cost him his job and almost all he owns. Sutherland is good as Harriman, as is Nancy Travis as Rita, whilst Jeff Bridges puts in another convincing performance as the unnerving Barney.Todd Graff's screenplay takes a little too long to get going (and when it does it becomes slightly fantastic), but it's worth the wait. Never overly suspenseful, but still a fine, unsettling film.Saturday, June 5, 1993 - Knox District Centre</fullReview>
