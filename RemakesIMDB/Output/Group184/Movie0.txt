		<shortDescription>Thirties Art Deco Masterpiece!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beauty of two-strip Technicolor rendering sensual pastel tones and settings in London (1921) and New York (1933), art direction by legendary Anton Grot, Orry-Kelly gowns, Lionel Atwill at his maddest and Fay Wray in all her splendor, make this one of the finest horror films of not only the 30s but of all time. The pace of this film is fast, the comedy relief enjoyable but not detracting from its story. Atwill imbues his character of Ivan Igor with all the menace and evil he could muster (and that was calibrated in tons!) So far superior to its remake (HOUSE OF WAX with Vincent Price) that it leaves its competitor in the dust. Easily my favorite film to look at after New Year's Eve parties. Fantastic fun and candy for the eyes with all that streamlined Art Deco grandeur!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Glenda Farrell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>She has been so sorely maligned. Despite what has been claimed by others here, Glenda Farrell was not a bad actress. A little broad sometimes perhaps, but not bad. She is a dynamo of live energy, which the film badly needs, for the only other energetic character in the film is Atwill, and only Farrell has the force to bring him down(that the script does not let her do so personally betrays the character). It is not Farrell's performance or even her character which is the problem of the film, but the script which makes that character necessary. Chock Full O' undeveloped characters (only Atwill and Farrell qualify as more than ciphers)whose paths cross coincidentally,Farrell's reporter is the one in the middle bringing the disparate elements together. A reporter or policeman had to be the central character, for only one of those two would be privy to all or even enough of the info needed to solve the puzzle, or to even recognize that the puzzle existed. And only a female reporter could be Fay Wray's roommate, as female police detectives or beat cops didn't exist(at least not in Hollywood). And only a fast-talking, wisecracking, brash and fierce female reporter able to beat the stereotypical fast-talking, wisecracking, brash 1930's male reporter at his own game could find the story AND crack the case before the police. Others have objected to the attention given the comic relief, apparently misunderstanding the term. Comic relief characters are supporting characters, and in this film, despite third billing, Glenda Farrell is the female lead. Fay Wray was a freelancer and able to negotiate better billing even though her role doesn't deserve it. Had she not had a real lead in the companion film DR.X, it's unlikely she would have been asked to take such a small part. Charlotte is needed in the story only for a face, and her face and scream are all Wray is allowed to bring to the role. As outstanding as those two attributes are, they don't add up to a real character. And while Farrell cracks wise, she is doing serious work central to the tale. A role with comedic content is not automatically a comic relief part. The script is a mess, letting down the great concept. HOUSE OF WAX is a much tighter script, more linear, combining ingenue and snoop into one role, and beefing up the part of the disfigured sculptor. It drops the very extraneous playboy character and the loose ends which trail in his wake. But most agree that HOUSE is boring compared to MYSTERY, and in addition to the direction and editing, much of MYSTERY's drive comes from the girl reporter and the crack actress who played her. Even if you do find her grating, Glenda Farrell is never boring.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remember this forgotten masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A genuinely frightening film from Michael Curtiz, jack of no trades and master of all. Many of the tricks of classic 1930's horror are here, including the opening scene set in a dark, rainy London street, the long shadows on the wall, lengthy periods of silence, and all timed to perfection. Only the faster-than-the-speed-of-sound dialogue of Glenda Farrell truly lets the film down. But other than that it is a gothic masterpiece, an underrated movie probably due to the fact that it lay undiscovered, thought lost, for over half a century. Far more inventive and imaginative than the majority of horror films made today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor Classic, But Fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, which was remade as "House Of Wax" 20 years later (as if you didn't know), might not enjoy quite the reputation it does today had it not been the basis for the better-known later film and, more importantly, believed lost for over 30 years, which made it something of a legend for many people who'd never even seen it. Legendary status can be rather difficult to live up to, and unless a viewer is approaching it with no advance knowledge of its history, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM may not be quite what one expects.It is, nevertheless, an energetic and entertaining amalgam of genres: horror film meets newspaper crime drama. Dropping a rather Gothic tale of body-snatching, a mad sculptor and a museum of wax-covered corpses into the streamline-moderne milieu of fast-talking, wise-cracking reporters on the trail of a hot story makes for interesting contrasts.Lionel Atwill, as Ivan Igor, the artist driven to insanity and murder by the destruction of his wax "children" in an arson fire, was an immensely enjoyable performer whose best work came a bit later (see "Son Of Frankenstein" for his portrayal of the one-armed Insp. Krogh). His natural screen presence carries him through, though he never quite generates either the pathos or the smooth menace that Vincent Price displayed in the remake. But from the moment of her entrance, it's Glenda Farrell as Florence Dempsey, the reporter out to save her job by bringing in a scoop - barreling onto the screen with a full head of steam - who propels the story all the way to its finish.There's an awful lot going on here beyond the basic premise; bootlegging, a "dope fiend," a suicide and a falsely implicated millionaire playboy are thrown into the mix, packing quite a lot into the 77 minute running time (the remake improved the story by eliminating extraneous characters and subplots). A pre-"King Kong" Fay Wray (in her naturally red hair sans the "Kong" blond wig) is the damsel in actual distress, but despite her billing, she's basically a supporting player and has little to do - beyond enduring roommate Florence's snide comments about her penniless boyfriend - until the climactic confrontation between all the bad guys and good guys (and girls).MYSTERY is well-served by the direction of Michael Curtiz ("Adventures Of Robin Hood," "Casablanca"), who was something of a jack-of-all-genres, and there's plenty of snappy dialogue, some of which (Florence asking a cop, "How's your sex life?") wouldn't have made it to the screen a year later under the newly re-written Production Code. Depending on one's point of view, it could be said that the very effective production design either benefits, or suffers, from the pale pastels of the two-strip Technicolor photography. For my part, I'm guessing that the subdued tones we see today result from the lack of first-rate film elements available. Having seen far superior two-strip from years earlier, I'll wager that the original prints were much more vivid.If you're any kind of a fan of the remake, you do owe it to yourself to see this one, if only once. There are many things to enjoy in MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, not the least of which are the fabulous ensembles worn by Farrell. Just how does a newspaper reporter one step away from the breadline afford a wardrobe like that?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Thirties Movies Made for the 30s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Considering the fact that this 1933 movie was produced during the depression, when moviegoers expected pure entertainment, the results were exactly what they wanted. Glenda Farrell's hard-boiled Florence Dempsey was what filmgoers were looking for. Please note that many of the movies of the period had male and female stars who were fast talkers and wise-crackers. Such stars as Cary Grant, Carole Lombard, Rosalind Russell, Bette Davis, James Cagney, Mae West, W. C. Fields, William Powell, Myrna Loy, etc. were the norm and not the exception.This wonderful movie was way ahead of its time. It's two-color look was also something very different for the 1930s and its washed-out looked helped give it a more sinister appearance. The later "House of Wax" used 3-D and having seen it in the movies I can tell you it was probably the best of the 3-D movies. Even better than "The Creature from the Black Lagoon".Fay Wray was pure candy and she practiced her scream well for the upcoming "King Kong". I have seen most of Lionel Atwill's work and I believe the underplaying of Ivan Igor helped make him a more credible monster. The movie was well cast and one can not help but notice the uncanny fact that most of the actors in "The House of Wax" were chosen because they looked like the earlier actors except for the difference between Charles Buchinsky (Bronson) and Matthew Betz as the loyal mute assistant.Although enjoyable, "The House of Wax" was no match for the earlier edition. It's understandable that "The House of Wax" did not use the characters of Florence Dempsey and Gavin Gordon. Sidekicks didn't work as well as in the 50s.I wonder what the movie critics of the 30s thought of the "Mystery of the Wax Museum?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London after dark. A gallery of life-like wax figures. An argument, a fight &amp; a fire. A man left to die in the flames. And as they melt, the figures seem to weep at their own destruction.So starts MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, credited as the first horror film with a modern urban setting - New York City. Glenda Farrell is the brash, blonde reporter trying to help her pal Fay Wray discover the secrets of a new wax museum just about to open, and those of its director Lionel Atwill, who is confined to a wheelchair due to a past accident. Murder &amp; mayhem &amp; wax-covered flesh will all figure into the plot before the mystery is solved.This was one of Atwill's best roles, playing an artist driven to dementia by the destruction of the only things he ever really loved. His is a very special, nuanced performance.Like DOCTOR X the year before, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM benefits from wonderful Anton Grot sets (especially the wax bath) and from having been filmed in early two-strip Technicolor, which makes all the ghastly figures seem to come alive...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Horror Mystery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is full of unexpected twists and turns as should be any good mystery. When bodies begin disappearing, a desperate reporter finally hopes to get the break she needs to keep her job by attempting to unravel the mystery. She soon finds herself investigating a new wax museum which just happens to have a woman figurine of Joan of Arc which greatly resembles one of the missing bodies named Joan Gale. From there things continue to unravel and conclude in surprisingly horrific fashion for the time and era.The Horror is there in terms of the mysterious burnt figure we see snatching the bodies as well as many other strange figures often seen only in menacing shadow.The acting is superb. Lionel Atwill is outstanding in the role of Ivan Igor-the owner of the new wax museum who is trying to recapture his past loss. Fay Wray is stunningly beautiful in her short role as Charlotte who finds herself in a whole lot of unexpected trouble. Glenda Farrell also adds considerable energy as the female reporter--a character which unfortunately became much too common and stereotypical in this period of film. Nonetheless Farrell is quite competent in the role and definitely adds her own stamp to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Landmark horror film that should not be missed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 1930's Jack Warner was under contract to use the Two-strip technicolor process on a Warner Brothers film. Unfortunately, this primitive form of color cinematography had a limited pallet of colors. Everything had an unnatural pastel look. Warner wisely choose a genre not dependent on reality- the horror film. Their first color horror film was DOCTOR X, a wild and macabre who-dunnit complete with scary murders, truly mad doctors and a cannibal. DOCTOR X, released in 1932, was enough of a success, that Warner Brothers reunited it's director, Michael Curtiz, the two leads, Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, and the two strip Technicolor process for yet another horror film. The new film, simply titled WAX MUSEUM during production was a fast moving creepy chiller that mixed the gloom of Depression era New York with the creepy going-ons of a wax museum. The film begins in 1921. Sculptor Ivan Igor (a bohemian looking Lionel Atwill), so obsessed creating his wax museum, that he ignores that he and his partner, Worth (Edwin Maxwell) are in deep financial trouble. Worth sets fire to the museum to collect on a fire insurance policy. The museum is destroyed, and Igor is left a cripple with useless hands. Twelve years later, in Manhattan, Igor opens a new wax museum. At the same time, a wisecracking reporter, Florence (Glenda Farrell) tracks a hot case of the corpse of a recently murdered socialite stolen from the morgue. She begins to suspect that creepy wax museum downtown of stealing bodies and posing them as wax statues. What makes things worse, is that her best friend, Ruth (Fay Wray) is dating the most innocent of the questionable wax-workers. THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is a DVD shelf must-have.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror and color masterpiece. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But one must consider its time period. 1933. Not a really sophisticated period in our history, nor particularly graphic. But the cast does a wonderful job, and the script is good--again, considering the year it was made. One cannot compare this movie to anything made even at the end of the 30s (SON OF FRANKENTSTEIN, for example.) It's a product of its time, and it succeeds as such. For my taste, it is far superior to any number of the no-plot slasher pics made in the past 25 years, the original HALLOWEEN being the exception. MYSTERY is not for everyone--but for fans of genre films of years past, this one ranks right up there with FRANKENSTEIN, KING KONG, and DR. JEKYLL AND MR. HYDE--all of the same era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In 1921, in London, Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is an artist, sculpting masterpieces in wax and exposing them in a small and non-profitable museum. When his partner proposes a criminal fire to receive the insurance, Ivan does not accept and fights with him, but he is knocked out and left in the burning place. In 1933, in New York, the crippled Ivan Igor reappears in a wheelchair and with hands destroyed by fire, preparing the grand-opening of his London Wax Museum. Meanwhile, the snoopy reporter of the New York Express Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell) is investigating the death of a woman, and finds that many corpses had vanished from the city morgue. She suspects that Ivan is stealing the bodies and covering them with wax for the museum."The Mystery of the Wax Museum" is a creepy and funny classic horror movie, with a great story of insanity of a passionate artist that loses his ability to sculpt statues of wax, and decides to cover corpses with wax to expose in his museum. The creepy make-up of Lionel Arwill is very impressive and the art direction is awesome. This practically unknown film is better and better than the 1953 remake with Vincent Price. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Os Crimes do Museu" ("The Crimes of the Museum")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery of the Wax Museum represents a moderate success for 1930's horror film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These days, Mystery of the Wax Museum has become best known for the fact that it was the film that spawned the 1953 classic starring Vincent Price. This is somewhat unfair, however, as although this film isn't a brilliant masterpiece, or even genre classic, it has a right to remembered in it's own right. The film is actually quite daring and inventive for the time when it was made; and despite the fact that nothing too bad is graphically shown, for obvious reasons, some of the imagery on display does actually succeed in being quite disturbing. Take the deformed face of the central character for example; it won't keep you up all night, but considering the time when this was made; the effects are good. The two-strip Technicolor style of the film gives it something of a unique feel; and this again is to it's credit as the film has aged really, really well. The plot line will be familiar to anyone who has seen the Vincent Price version, but here, aside from a museum proprietor that gets his life work melted away in an inferno; we've got a press investigation into the affairs as well.Lionel Atwill takes the lead role as the unfortunate victim of the flames, and while he's certainly no Vincent Price; he does well with what he's got and helps to create a macabre surrounding around his character, which in turn helps the film in the atmosphere department. Joining him are Glenda Farrell and Fay Wray as the heroine's of the story. Wray plays the girl that the unfortunate artist becomes obsessed with, and Farrell gives a slightly irritating, but very lively performance as a journalist. Both do well with their roles, and although this film isn't exactly an exhibition in acting (unlike Curtiz's masterpiece, Casablanca); the cast do well enough. One thing that is unfortunate for this film is that it's seen as a second feature for the Price version, which will harm what some viewers think of it as the plot elements are very similar to the 1953 film, so it can, at times, feel as though you're simply watching the same film again. However, if viewed as a stand-alone product, Mystery of the Wax Museum represents a solid 30's horror movie and I can see why any horror fan wouldn't enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (Warner Brothers, 1933), reunites director Michael Curtiz with his DOCTOR X (First National, 1932) co-stars, Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, in another two-strip Technicolor horror/comedy mystery. A carbon copy of DOCTOR X with a few alterations and improvements thrown in, it ranks the finest and most noteworthy of the Atwill-Fay collaborations (1933's THE VAMPIRE BAT for Majestic was their second), as well as the most eerie and mysterious of them all. While Atwill and Wray had equal status in their initial two outings, Atwill this time dominates while Wray, interestingly, has little to do, not making her screen presence until 30 minutes from the opening titles. She's gone for long stretches and is not visible in the fadeout while Glenda Farrell, the secondary female character, comes close to being the lead, or so it appears. Regardless of Wray's limitations, her character is quite crucial to the story and to Atwill's mentally unbalanced character.Opening with a prologue set in 1921 London introduces Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) as a brilliant sculptor of wax figures of noteworthy figures as Joan of Arc, Jack the Ripper, Disraeli, and his most favorite, Marie Antoinette, hoping for his museum to become successful once it opens to the public. Because he's invested more money than anticipated, Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell), his partner whom he owes back salary, comes upon a plan to get back some of his investment by burning down the museum and collect on the fire insurance. A fight ensues between the two partners, with Worth breaking away, locking Igor inside the museum surrounded by flames where he's left to burn along with his wax figures. Move forward, New Year's Eve, 1933, in New York City. Ivan, who has survived the burning flames, is wheelchair bound. Unable to recreate his wax figures due to his severely burned hands, he hires assistants, Ralph (Allen Vincent); D'Arcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe) and Hugo (Matthew Betz) to sculpt wax figures for him under his supervision. Successfully reproducing his original creations, Igor is unable to do the same with Marie Antoinette, that is, until he meets her replica, Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray), Ralph's fiancée. In the meantime, a series of murders have taken place with bodies mysteriously disappearing from the morgue from some figure in a cloak. Millionaire playboy Harold Ritten (Gavin Gordon), who happened to be with Joan Gale on the night of her murder, is suspected and jailed. Florence Parks (Glenda Farrell), Charlotte's roommate and gal reporter for the New York Express, is assigned by her editor (Frank McHugh) to investigate. Following her interview with Harold leading to her constant snooping around Igor's 14th Street wax museum, she discovers something quite startling in connection to the murder, hence "the mystery of the wax museum." If the story sounds at all familiar, it was reworked more famously as HOUSE OF WAX (Warners, 1954) starring Vincent Price in the Atwill role. Due to the popularity of the remake, the original from which it was based, was virtually unknown, especially since no prints of MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM have survived. Fortunately, an original print was discovered, according to sources, in Jack L. Warner's private vault around the late 1960s. WAX MUSEUM finally turned up on commercial television, notably on New York City's WPIX, Channel 11's "Chiller Theater" on February 10, 1973, where it broadcast annually until 1977, only in black and white format only. It would be another decade before two-strip Technicolor prints surfaced and distributed on home video and DVD, with broadcasts on Turner Network Television (1988-1993) and finally Turner Classic Movies (1994-present).With Glenda Farrell assuming the wisecracking reporter role Lee Tracy enacted in DOCTOR X, her performance in this venture seems right and warranted, improving over Tracy's lackluster buffoonery. Even if Farrell's character disappoints, the script does not and neither does Atwill. Who could forget his key scenes as the bearded Igor conversing with his favorite wax figure of Marie Antoinette, and his outlook as he witnesses the melting of his "children" in a blazing fire (very realistically done and effective in color), along with his unforgettable confrontation with the screaming Wray as he offers her "eternal life" in the manner that would have done 1925s "Phantom of the Opera" star Lon Chaney proud had he lived to see this.In some ways, THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is perfect, in others it's not, but must have been good enough to acquire a remake, find the missing negative for the original and have it displayed as one of the finer horror classics to come out from the 1930s.

		<fullReview>I truly love this movie and it fits so well into the 1930s horror genre. Thrills and comic relief in just the right dosages. The use of German Expressionism in the individual shots as well as the lighting that made the horrific sufficiently creepy. Leonard Maltin in his usual dismissal of 30s films as "creaky" comes off as just a purist snob and it's as if he can't just go along for the fun ride. Unlike the remake "House of Wax" it doesn't come off as corny or a kind of "tongue and cheek" that is more like a thumbing of the nose. Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh make their scenes a delight and move the story along as we get a true feel of the cinema of that time. Things that are sorely missing in the 1953 remake. The use of two strip Technicolor is not as vibrant as the later product. but it gives the charm of the silent picture period with it's use of color for atmosphere, with the blues of night scenes and all. It's so good that this film was rescued from Jack Warner's garage when it was so that we may all enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really like the remake of this film ("House of Wax," with Vincent Price), but having at last seen this original, I have to admit that this is the superior suspense film. Unlike the director of "House," Alex DeToth, who is content to get the story made as efficiently as possible, and still allow plenty of time for effect, Curtiz uses his version to exercise pretty much everything he had learned about film up 'till then. Especially notable are the references to German expressionism - the shot of Atwill climbing up the crooked basement stairs is almost a perfect duplication of a shot in "The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari." What makes this demonstration of skill more remarkable is the material - looked at coolly, the story is just a little bit more extravagant than the typical 'girl-reporter-as-detective' B-movie thriller of the time (a plot device particularly loved by 'poverty row' studios like PRC). But Curtiz works hard to get a classy look showcasing naturalistic performances. He largely succeeds, and thus produces a film ahead of its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Mystery of Wax Museum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's a review of the film I wrote way back in 1973 for a fanzine called " Huitoxopetl"-On Friday, Nov.9,1963, on the "Today" show, Fay Wray reminisced about "Mystery of the Wax Museum" with Jack Lescoulie: JL: " There was 1 scene I remember with Lionel Atwill where you reached up &amp;struck his face &amp;it cracked &amp;there was this hideous make-up underneath." FW : " That was 1 time my technique absolutely deserted me, I must admit.There was a wax face that he had created himself to cover his own ugliness. I was in his cluthes &amp;I had to hit him on the face. It was necessary for the audience to see this &amp;be shocked. But when I struck him, &amp;the moment I saw part of him, I just froze! I wanted to run- I just couldn't go on ! So they had to make another mask &amp;do it over when I recovered. It was just so real." Little did I dream that almost 10 years after this interview I would get a chance to see this long-thought-lost film on TV. On Feb.24, 1973. Louisville's channel 41 showed "Mystery of the Wax Museum" ! It was indeed a mystery, emphasizing the mystery potential rather than the horror potential as was done with its superior remake, "House of Wax" (1953). The film opens with Edwin Maxwell burning down the London waxworks of Prof. Igor (Lionel Atwill) with its proprietor in the center of the conflagration.("House of Wax" was extremely faithful in reproducing this scene.) " Mystery" then moves 12 years into the future, to New York , New Year's Eve,1933, where a crippled Lionel Atwill watches the celebration. ( This 12-year lapse is 1 of the film's advantages over the remake- the reason, no doubt, , Atwill's unmasking is considered superior to Vincent Price's. The time lapse made it easier for earlier audiences to disassociate the crippled Prof. Igor from the body-snatching monster. In "House" there is never any doubt that Price's Prof. Jarrod &amp;the disfigured murderer are 1 &amp;the same; in "Mystery", the audience can think the cripple is the unwitting victim of the still living Edwin Maxwell,making the unmasking , revealing the extent of Atwill's injuries, all the more effective. While Atwill watches the celebration, morgue attendants pick up the body of a supposed suicide.The scene then changes to the morgue where the body is brought &amp;abit of dialogue from "House" is clarified. The attendant's epitath is " Her husband says she talked too much." The corpse rises up, a reaction to the embalming fluid &amp;as they push the body back down, the attendant says " Just like a woman, always has to have the last word." ( "House" kept the punchline without the rest of the joke.) After the attendants leave, another body rises up, the sheet slips down to reveal the gnarled walnut face of the monster who steals the body. It later shows up in Atwill's new Wax Museum as Joan of Arc. Glenda Farrel, the film's wisecracking reporter, is the roommate of Fay Wray ( who is the exact double for Atwill's old Marie Antoinette statue.) Miss Wray's fiancé is an art student under Prof . Igor. Miss Farrel finds the suicide's toetag on the new Joan of Arc statue &amp;becomes suspicious. Atwill tells her the statue is the work of Arthur Edmund Carewe ( who the film has already established is a junkie,a drug slave to Edwin Maxwell. "House" remade him into a "mere" alcoholic.) Miss Farrel follows Carewe to the basement of a deserted house where the audience gets its 2nd glimpse of the monster.He is seen moving a box Miss Farrel suspects contains the suicide's missing body. ( She thinks molds are being made from the missing corpses &amp;the wax statues are cast from the molds.) Miss Farrel calls the police &amp;the box turns out to be only bootleg whiskey. Carewe is arrested &amp;a watch is found on him belonging to a missing judge. Miss Wray goes to the Wax Museum to meet her fiancé &amp;finds Atwill. The famous unmasking scene then occurs. "Fiend, Fiend !" screams miss Wray. " "Yes, there is a fiend but it is not I, my Marie Antoinette"says Prof. Igor." A fiend who did this".( He gestures with his burnt hands) For 12 years this living deadman has hunted for this fiend. Now here he is, behind the door !" Atwill opens the door &amp;out tumbles the wax-coated corpse of Edwin Maxwell ! Miss Farrel goes to the Museum to compare the Museum's Voltaire with the photo of the missing judge. She hears Fay Wray's scream when the Prof. plans to immortalize her by embalming her in wax &amp;summons the police. Miss Wray is rescued &amp;the Prof. tumbles into a vat of wax. All in all,the film was a thrill to watch. "House" is probably the better of the 2, not having the many subplots that detract from "Mystery"s" main storyline.

		<shortDescription>Classic horror well above average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen (in very bad 3D) the remake House of Wax, I found this classic horror a delightful contrast. It is lifted out of the ordinary by good production values (including excellent early color), convincing performances, enough subplots to keep you glued to the screen, and the fast pace so characteristic of the best of the films of the 30's and early forties.I am particular partial to horror that manages to blend comic vignettes and one-liners without losing the essential hair-raising suspense, and this film delvers both in full measure.Particularly memorable is the early scene in which extremely lifelike wax figures melt and crumble. Almost-real human figures have a special twist of horror when they behave unexpectedly, and this scene exploits our reactions perfectly.This film deserves to be better known and valued, especially in the context of its period, long before gushing blood and screaming teens became the hallmark of "horror". This film is more frightening than any modern slasher, and the comic relief, as it should, makes the horrific stand out more starkly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An energetic Glenda Farrell and a screaming Fay Wray solve the gruesome secret of those wax mannequins</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mystery of the Wax Museum is more mystery than horror, but the secret of Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill), which comes by way of a sharp crack to his head, is satisfyingly startling. Despite the age of the movie, it holds up as a half campy, half affectionate look at what made our grandparents or great grandparents jump in their seats. The plot has to do with a genius of wax who creates tableaux featuring wax mannequins of famous dead people. When his business partner wants more money and less artistry, the result is a fire for insurance that leaves Igor dead...or so it seems. Years later a new wax museum opens in New York and a resurrected Ivan Igor is behind it. Now he uses assistants to actually create his amazingly lifelike models, since his hands, he says, were severely burned in that fire. Of course, there seem to be a number of disappearances, most likely murders, that are happening around this time. Could there be a connection? A young woman who is searching for her missing roommate, a boyfriend who works for Igor and a very determined female reporter are going to find out. I liked four things about the movie. First, the look of all those wax mannequins. I'd bet that they were all extras with a little artificial makeup, then posed motionless for the few seconds the camera would linger on them. They had a creepy quality about them that I don't think could have been achieved by using artificial heads. Second, Lionel Atwill. He was a good actor who settled comfortably into B movies in the Thirties and either never wanted to leave the steady money or was never offered a chance later after he had become type-cast. I've always found him to be worth watching, whether as a villainous businessman, a mad scientist or a monster. Third, Glenda Farrell as Florence Dempsey, the blond, feisty reporter who breaks the case. She may only have third billing, but she's the real star of the movie. She later parlayed that character into a series as Torchey Blane in seven movies between 1937 and 1939. Torchey (she's now showing on TCM) is a fast-talking, energetic, impulsive reporter who carries all before her. She's vivid but best in small doses. That's the kind of character Glenda Farrell often played, and that's who Florence Dempsey is, too. And fourth, the wise- cracking relationship between Florence and her editor boss, played by Frank McHugh. It's funny and affectionate...and the movie ends with a smile when Florence picks love over money. As far as Fay Wray, she looks good and screams a lot. The early Technicolor process gives the movie a lot of charm.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An underrated tale of mystery...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early 30s, Hungarian director Michael Curtiz was still considered a recently arrived foreigner working at Warner Bros. after impressing legendary producer Jack Warner with his work in Germany. In those early days of his career in the U.S. Curtiz began to make himself a name as a hard working director who always managed to work effectively under the studio system, and it was with the success of the horror films, "The Mad Genius" and "Doctor X", when he proved to be not only effective, but also able to make box-office hits. It was really the success of "Doctor X" what prompted Warner Brothers to make another horror movie in the same style, with the same same cast, and keeping Michael Curtiz as director. The result was the now classic Technicolor thriller, "Mystery of the Wax Museum".Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is an extremely talented sculptor of wax figures in London, however, his employer thinks that Igor's business i snot making enough money for both of them, and starts a fire at Igor's Wax Museum in order to collect the insurance money. Thirteen years later, Ivan Igor is tragically crippled and unable to use his hands, but with the help of his students he is finally ready to reopen his museum in New York City. In the meantime, the police is baffled by the case of several corpses stolen from the City's morgue, including the one of a famous socialité. The case attracts the attention of Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell), a young reporter looking for her big story, and immediately she starts to investigate. Her suspicion will lead her to important clues, and Igor's strange obsession with Florence's roommate Charlotte (Fay Wray) will take her to uncover the strange mystery of the Wax Museum.The key word in "Mystery of the Wax Museum" is "Mystery", as unlike it's better known 1953 remake (which focuses on horror and suspense), this version of Charles Belden's play behaves more like a simple, yet really captivating, tale of mystery where our main character, Florence, must discover who and more importantly "how" is committing the crimes. Adapted by Don Mullaly and Carl Erickson, the movie has a very original plot that unfolds nicely despite the fast pace of the film. The fact that it was written before the days of the Hays code allows the film to include lots of sexual innuendo and situations that later would be considered immoral. The characters are overall very well developed, and the addition of comedy (courtesy of Farrell's wisecracking character) works nicely with the creepy mystery of the story.On of the lasts movies to be shot in the primitive two-color Technicolor system, it has a marvelous bleached look that works perfectly with the modernist art-deco style of the sets designed for the film. Director Michael Curtiz allows himself to show the influence he received when working in Germany during the years of expressionism, and gives the film an ominous dark look as Florence gets deeper inside the Wax Museum (although not as striking as what Universal Studios did with its horror films). It's worth to point out that while Curtiz may be better known as an effective director for hire under the studio system, he really shows a definite style in this film, and begins to give form to the elements that would later become part of his masterpiece, "Casablanca".The cast is overall excellent, although it is of course difficult not to make comparisons with the performances of the better known 50s version. Lionel Atwill offers one of his most underrated performances of his career as Ivan Igor, and while he lacks the charm that Vincent Price would give to the role, he is very believable as the tortured artist, victim of misfortune. Glenda Farrell's turn as Florence Dempsey has been harshly criticized due to the comic nature of her character's persona, but honestly she makes a terrific job as the main character, vastly overshadowing the more famous Fay Wray; who while looking stunningly beautiful here, lacks the presence that would make her an icon in "King Kong".While "House of Wax" tends to get the upper hand when compared to the original version, "Mystery" is by no means a bad movie, simply a different one. As written above, this movie focuses completely on the mystery aspect of the story, and while it does have its fair share of horrific elements, they are minimal when compared with the Gothic horror of "House of Wax". True, it certainly looks dated by today's standards, but the movie has a notorious modernist (in the architecture, designs, etc...) touch that may have looked futurist for the 30s society. The special effects are definitely less impressive than in the remake, but considering the times when they were done are still an excellent work, and some look really impressive thanks to the lavish Technicolor process.Personally, I find in "House" and "Mystery" a classic example of what a remake should be, as the two are excellent movies that explore the same story under different angles. Fans tend to dismiss "Mystery", but I think it's equally as good as the legendary Vincent Price film. "Mystery of the Wax Museum" is a very interesting movie for fans of "House of Wax", and a definitive must-see for those interested in horror movies of the 30s. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless genre classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the DVD I own, "Mystery of the Wax Museum" is shamelessly downgraded to being an extra! The full version can be found on the region 2 DVD of "House of Wax", but you literally have to select the special features in order to access and watch it. Admittedly the 1950's version starring the legendary Vincent Price is the most popular version of the same story (and, according to many fans, the most superior one), but come on! THIS is the original classic and it honestly deserves a slightly more respectful treatment. First and foremost, the roots of all wax-related horror productions lie here and, secondly, it's a truly beautiful cinema accomplishment that still holds up pretty well even by today's standards. The basic concept still hasn't lost any of its creepy &amp; sinister impact, the characterizations are complex and often ahead of their time and Michael Curtiz' filming style comes darn close to brilliance, with the enchanting two-strip Technicolor method, the slick use of shadows and genuinely eerie decors &amp; scenery. "Mystery of the Wax Museum" could be considered Warner Bros. horror response to the successes Universal Pictures was experiencing with their monster movies. As mesmerizing as "Frankenstein", "Dracula" and "The Mummy" were, this type of horror is scarier and much more disturbing. Lionel Atwill portrays a real flesh and blood psychopath (albeit driven to insanity through circumstances) and his victims' fates are much more horrifying. Twelve years after his former partner destroyed his lifework to recover money of the insurance; the extremely talented but arrogant sculptor Ivan Igor opens the doors of a brand new wax museum overseas in New York. His work is widely praised and his statues look very real. Perhaps even too real? When the corpse of a young girl, coincidentally resembling Joan of Arc, disappears for the morgue, the witty and ambitious reporter Florence Dempsey begins to suspect that real corpses are subjected to public exhibition. She gets the opportunity to investigate further when Igor becomes obsessed with her roommate, who's the mirror image of his former masterpiece statue of Marie Antoinette. Despite not disposing of the same charisma Vincent Price has (who can blame him), Lionel Atwill is quite menacing as the obsessively deranged artist. The film also stars the legendary big screen actress Fay Wray, but Glenda Farell as the brutal journalist easily overshadows her weak role. She even makes the film unusually comical! Especially her one-liners and heated discussions with the editor are unforgettable. The effects are terrific and multiple images still have the power to make you cringe with fear. No matter what era the film is made in, wax statues slowly melting through fire are spooky to behold. "Mystery of the Wax" museum is a timeless horror classic and fundamental viewing for all people interested in vintage cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A true eye-opener for film-lovers, this has to be one of the most inventive and subversive Hollywood films of the period. It's historically significant as one of the last two-strip Technicolor films, and boasts an excellent script. superb design by Anton Grot, great costumes and first-rate cinematography. Compared to the leaden pacing, framing and editing of so many other films of the era, it's strikingly dynamic in its presentation, with many very funny sequences, alongside some genuinely scary scenes. If for no other reason, it's worth seeing for the fantastic Glenda Farrell, who is absolutely outstanding and steals every scene she's in, including her hilarious (and remarkably racy) rapid-fire exchanges with Frank McHugh. Just see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Made Frankenstein look like a lily"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The early 1930s was perhaps the only real golden age of the horror. It didn't really introduce much that was new to the genre, but it contributed many of its unrivalled classics. The horrors of this time have a certain quality whereby they on the one hand revel in all the clichés of the form, whilst at the same time twisting and stretching them with all the playful inventiveness typical of the early sound era.Take for example the fact that Mystery of the Wax Museum is filmed in two-strip Technicolor. Colour was a rarity at the time and was mostly used to augment the splendour of the many depression-era musicals, and yet the two-strip process seems ideally suited to making this picture what it is. Cinematographer Ray Rennahan (later to receive Academy Awards for Gone with the Wind and Blood and Sand), rather than splurging on a multitude of shades, seems to view colour filming in dual terms of light and dark tone. What you see on the screen bares little resemblance to the usual bland red and green of two-strip. Instead figures tend to be picked out in warm reddish-yellow tones against the gloom, which by contrast almost takes on the blue that was impossible for this format. This warm hue which bathes people and sculpture alike brings to mind blood, fire and wax and is just as eerie as stark monochrome.Director Michael Curtiz had a real feel for the macabre, as well as a slightly misanthropic tendency to view props and players as being of more or less equal importance. This ironically works in Wax Museum's favour, as Curtiz brings out the various waxworks as characters in their own right. The opening shot is almost like a spoof of the elaborate crowd sweeps with which Curtiz would open pictures like Angels with Dirty Faces and Casablanca, tracking through the lifeless sculptures as if it were some frozen street-scene, eventually alighting on Lionel Atwill like one of the figures come to life. Curtiz also encourages relaxed, understated performances, far more so than was the norm at the time, especially for a director of European origin. Perhaps he didn't want the actors upstaging their inanimate counterparts? Whatever his reasoning, the low-key performances are ideal for the creepy tone of this picture. Lionel Atwill gives one of his most believable turns, presenting Igor as a generally mild-mannered artist, giving a vague, delusional quality to his occasional lapses into anger. His gentle eastern-European accent is enough to remind us of his foreign beginnings without turning him into a vulgar stereotype. The overt hamminess of Bela Lugosi may be massively more fun, but Atwill wins out in the stakes of genuine scariness. And Atwill's success here has much to do with the kind of horror it is he appears in. As we see in Psycho or Silence of the Lambs, a cruel and unusual human mind is a far more frightening prospect than a mere monster.The other great player here is Glenda Farrell, giving an engaging and likable spin on the wise-cracking go-getting heroine, a character of a sort she would later reprise in the Torchy Blane serial. She may get third billing, just under the better-known Fay Wray, but Farrell is the true lead of this horror-drama, and this in itself is part of the beguiling oddness of Mystery of the Wax Museum. Wray is the then-obligatory female victim, but from the gaggle of male good-guys no-one emerges as her heroic saviour. In a refreshing twist it is this smart sassy woman who takes on the eponymous mystery. The strong conventions of the day around women and action may mean Farrell is excused from the final rescue sequence, but the cunning and determination of her character mean we can view her as a forerunner of Ellen Ripley and Clarice Starling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Minor Horror Masterpiece from Michael Curtiz!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Casablanca" director Michael Curtiz's chiller "Mystery in the Wax Museum" ranks as a minor masterpiece of modern horror. Reportedly, this eerie Lionel Atwill epic qualified as the first urban horror film. Indeed, this Warner Brothers release ripples with tragic overtones that make some characters seem less hackneyed. The villain, for example, doesn't set out to be villainous, but a disastrous turn of events alters his destiny. Nevertheless, Curtiz manages to blend heavy-handed horror with nimble, fast-talking comedy in a pre-Code, two-strip Technicolor hair-raiser co-starring Fay Wray before "King Kong," Frank McHugh, and Glenda Farrell.Curtiz lets nothing slow down this brisk nail biter, and scenarists Don Mullaly and Carl Erickson conjure up dialogue as snappy as it is imaginative. Two-time Academy Award winning lenser Ray Rennahn, whose credits include "Gone with the Wind" and "Blood and Sand," imbues the action a surreal flavor with the two-strip, pastel-colored Technicolor process. Curtiz's penchant for 'Dutch tilt' angles, shadows, and mobile camera movement enhances the look. The sinister atmosphere of this lively little murder-mystery with macabre melodramatics mixed is balanced by its lightweight comedy involving a female journalist on the prowl for a scoop. "Mystery in the Wax Museum" represented Warner Brothers' contribution to the horror cycle that had been the rage as a result of the Universal Studios "Frankenstein" and "Dracula" franchises and the Bela Lugosi classic "White Zombie." Interestingly, this 77-minute epic reunited Curtiz, Rennahn, Atwill, Wray, and Arthur Edmund Carewe who had worked together on the 1932 Curtiz' feature "Doctor X." The film unfolds in London, England, in the year 1921, during a dark, stormy night as two older, well-dressed gentlemen take a horse-drawn carriage to visit the Wax Museum of sculptor Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill of "Doctor X") and admire his extraordinary handiwork. Ivan explains to them he prefers sculpting in wax to stone because wax yields more life-like replicas. Galatalin, (Claude King of "Cavalcade"), who is in route to an archaeological dig in Egypt, assures Ivan he will bring Ivan's artistry to the attention of the Royal Academy. Naturally, Ivan is overwhelmed with gratitude. He treats his wax figures as if they were flesh &amp; blood family. After the two gentlemen depart, Ivan's evil business associate arrives to inform him that they are so poor that they haven't a farthing between them. He proposes to burn the wax exhibition for the fire insurance that will allow them to split 10-thousand pounds between them. Igor is livid with rage that his partner would concoct such a scheme. Ivan tangles with his business partner when the latter ignites a piece of paper and slings it at a dress encased wax model. The place transforms into a raging inferno, and Igor's wax figures melt.Curtiz stages the action and edits between the melting figures to the humans locked in mortal combat until the ceiling crashes in and everything fades to black. These first ten minutes provide a dazzling display of Curtiz's sweeping, fluid camera-work as the camera prowls the wax museum and generates an aura of suspense when we are first shown the premises and later its appalling outcome. The melting figures take on momentary character as they melt and you share Ivan's horror about the demise of his wax figures. The age-old struggle between art and commerce lies as the bottom of Ivan's argument with his partner. The partner complains that their wax museum is not pulling in the customers because Ivan doesn't have any notorious characters in his exhibition like a more popular wax museum with the criminal figures.The action resumes on New Year's Eve in the Big Apple as party-goers watch a hospital ambulance haul off an apparent suicide case, Joan Gale, on the first day of 1933. The scene shifts to the morgue. Attendants wheel in a fresh corpse under wraps on a gurney. After they leave, the body gets up and it is a man wearing a gruesome mask. He tours the corpses, selects one, and dumps it out the window to his accomplices in a back alley. The scene shifts next to a newspaper office. Brash "New York Express" reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell of "I Am a Fugitive from a Chain Gang"), who has apparently been goofing off, strolls in to see her hard nosed editor, Jim (Frank McHugh of "The Front Page"), and Jim chews her out. "There's no room on this rag," Jim reprimands her, "for the purely ornamental." He informs Florence she should consider herself fired unless she comes back with a good story. "Even if it's only a new recipe for spaghetti." Immediately, Florence scrambles over to a police precinct house. Clearly, Florence knows these guys casually enough to quiz one old cop about his "sex life" while he is perusing a girlie magazine called "Naughty." The old cop explains the doctors plan to perform an autopsy on the Gale woman at Bellevue Hospital. Now, they suspect she may have been murdered. The police have millionaire playboy George Winston (Gavin Gordon of "Hollywood Halfbacks") in the Tombs since they think Gale had tried to blackmail him; it seems Gale and Winston were lovers.Naturally, Florence cannot believe Winston is guilty. Later, we learn Ivan has arrived in New York City where he is scheduled to open his new waxworks gallery. Florence visits Ivan's museum when she accompanies her roommate, Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray of "Doctor X"), who is supposed to meet her boyfriend for lunch. Ivan spots Charlotte and believes he is looking at his Marie Antoinette waxwork model. Meanwhile, Florence believes the wax statue of Joan of Arc is really Joan Gale, but her editor doesn't believe her. "Mystery in the Wax Museum" is a first-class horror comedy. Some of the things that it gets away with, like mentioning narcotics and substance abusers were later prohibited with the enforcement of the Production Code.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A sculptor is left for dead in the wax museum in which he works when his employer sets the place on fire to collect the insurance. Though his precious "children" melt around him, he survives and many years later opens his own wax museum, but is unable to do the actual sculpting because of his injuries. With murders and corpse robberies happening, a brash young reporter suspects something is happening at the wax museum.I was pleasantly surprised by the Mystery of the Wax Museum on my first viewing about a year ago, and just as pleased (though no longer surprised) on my second viewing today. It is a fast paced story with plenty of humor and sufficient horror to satisfy most fans of the old classic horror films. I believe that I like it better than the Vincent Price remake House of Wax.I've seen a lot of comments criticizing Glenda Farrell's portrayal of Flora Dempsey, the wisecracking reporter, but I found her one of the more interesting parts of this film. Fay Wray has an important but not very large role here, but does have a great scream. Lionel Atwill does well in his role as well.The early color used gives it a pastel appearance but it seems to work here and the entertaining story line more than makes up for any deficiencies from it.Overall, I really enjoyed this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've recently purchased this on DVD along with House of Wax. I was not disappointed. The transfer of both films were excellent. Mystery' was filmed in two strip Technicolor. The dominant blue color adds an eerie touch to this chiller. Lionel Atwell plays the sculptor who goes mad when his creations are destroyed in a fire started by his greedy partner. There is fast paced dialogue between the female reporter and her editor,and since there is little music after the opening credits, the film relies on its strong visuals. At seventy seven minutes, the film moves at a fast clip. Atwells make up is gruesome and the unmasking scene carries a jolt. The more recent film,House of Wax is almost a scene for scene and line for line remake. There were some changes. The drug addict in the first film is changed to an alcoholic . Vincent Price reprises Atwells role with little change. Sound effects add much to the films atmosphere along with a moody score. Shot in Warnercolor and Three Dimension, the DVD suffers slightly without the 3D effects. But all in all,Warners have done themselves proud with this transfer. The viewer has a great time comparing both films on the same disc. My rating :8 stars out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...Like the other titles I have written about, this one too ranks as one of my personnal favorites. Released in 1933, this motion picture was filmed in early two-color technicolor (an eerie blend of blue &amp; pinkish-red) wonderfully set to this movie. Anyways, it starts with the movie taking place 1st in London, 1921, with Mr. Igor (Atwill) sculpting on wax during a storm. After a visit from colleagues, Mr. Igor's partner....Mr. Worth, shows up and because of no money coming into the wax museum, Worth sets the place on fire to cash in on the insurance leaving Mr. Igor to die in the fire. Fast forward to 1933, Mr. Igor lives now in New York &amp; is in the process of opening a new wax museum. At the same time, bodies begin to disappear from the Morgue. Upon a tip from the police, Florence (Ferrell) begins to investigate &amp; finds that "there's something cockeyed about that place, &amp; I intend to find out". Mr. Igor finds his "Marie Antoinete" alive in Ralph's girlfriend (Wray) &amp; tries to talk her into being his next subject immortalized in wax. Not only did I like the storyline, but the visual effects in the movie as well as the color mixture. If by chance the storyline sounds familiar.....well it should. The basic foundation for this movie was used again in the 1953 3-D movie..."House of Wax". Both these movies are available as a 2 in 1 DVD. Enjoy. R.I.P., Phyllis Kirk.</fullReview>

Having seen Michael Curtiz's earlier Technicolor fright movie "Doctor X",I was expecting a similar campy movie. But this movie is far superior.It has a better protagonist in Glenda Farrell,the color photography is outstanding and Curtiz's direction brings out the suspense even without a musical score. It was quite surprising to see that one of the characters in the movie was a junkie.How censorship would change only a year later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Curtiz has over 170 directing credits, including "The Jazz Singer." Of the films on that list which I have seen, this is my favourite. It's filled with some quite amazing dolly and camera work, the story is fun and the acting is solid.This story has had a long life. This film, was based on a play. In 1953, it was re-made as a Vincent Price vehicle, "House of Wax" in 3-D. And in 2005, it was re-made again as a teen slasher. The premise is solidly creepy.Glenda Farrell is hilarious as the young journalist. Her energy leaps off the screen. I guess audiences of 1933 needed quite a bit of comic relief to make it through the rest of this. Lionel Atwill's make-up is fantastic. It's no surprise that it was designed by a Westmore: Hollywood's premiere make-up family.This was shot in a two-colour Technicolor process which makes the entire film rather distinctive and moody. The fantastic film noir lighting adds to it as well.If you can find this, it's a definite must-see! There are so many images and ideas borrowed from it in later horror films it's interesting to see their origins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really expect this to be as good as it was. Wax Museum was interesting and fun, both as a horror film and a picture from the 30's. The whole idea of real humans being the base for wax sculptures is a good one and it's executed nicely here. The shots of melting faces are particularly creepy. Lionel Atwill does just fine as the lead (good make-up effects) and Glenda Farrell plays a feisty, wisecracking (and sometimes grating) reporter, who, by the way, keeps the pace of the movie hopping. Fay Wray also has a small role too. Wax Museum was shot in a two color Technicolor process, which I thought looked cool. I also found some of the film to be rather risqué for the time, such as with certain lines of dialogue ("How's your sex life?") and other innuendos, and the dope fiend (who was changed to an alcoholic for the remake). Yep, this has become one of my favorite horrors from this decade.</fullReview>

The last (and best) of the three horror movies Lionel Atwill did with Fay Wray. Atwill is fantastic here and Wray is, as always, delightful. Nice support from Frank McHugh, Gavin Gordon, and Edwin Maxwell, among others. The scene stealer of the movie is Glenda Farrell as the fast-talking reporter heroine. She really has fun with the part. A few years later she would star in the Torchy Blane series and play a character very similar to the one she plays here.It's a good-looking movie, filmed in two-color Technicolor with nice atmospheric direction from Curtiz. The sets are great, especially Atwill's art deco laboratory. The makeup effects are terrific. It's a juicy Pre-Coder, as evidenced by the gruesome plot and the junkie character played by Arthur Edmund Carewe. Some viewers might be put off by the fact that a large chunk of the middle of the picture is more like a crime story/newspaper movie but I was always entertained, particularly by the back &amp; forth between Farrell and McHugh. So it's not a straight horror movie from beginning to end but, so what, it's still a great film and worth a look. Remade in the '50s as House of Wax with Vincent Price. That version is more well-known than this one but I like rewatching this one more. It's just more fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Original House of Wax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a dark and stormy night in 1921 London, "Wax Museum" sculptor Lionel Atwill (as Ivan Igor) shows potential investors his incredibly lifelike wax figures (played by real people). He hopes for a major exhibit, but Mr. Atwill's partner says they can't pay the rent on their museum and burns the place down. Tragically, Atwill is believed to have gone up in flames, while partner Edwin Maxwell (as Joe Worth) takes the insurance payoff. Twelve years later, Atwill turns up in New York City. He has decided to recreate his beloved wax museum. In a wheelchair and unable to sculpt due to injuries sustained in the fire, Atwill resorts to highly unethical methods to recreate his waxworks. When dead bodies mysteriously disappear, snoopy blonde reporter Glenda Farrell (as Florence Dempsey) begins to investigate...Early "Technicolor" gives this Monster "Mystery of the Wax Museum" a distinctive look. With Ms. Farrell's enterprising reporter, this version also has a stronger female lead, and famed "King Kong" (1933) screamer Fay Wray (as Charlotte Duncan) also appears. The women have a sexy scene, after about a half hour of running time. Watch for Ms. Wray to show off her legs in shorts and stockings while roommate Farrell slinks around in bed. Anton Grot's stylish sets and Ray Rennahan's photography, as directed by Michael Curtiz, enables this version to hold up well against the re-make "House of Wax" (1953). Interestingly, both "houses of wax" successfully employed visual gimmicks to entice viewers. The 1953 revision (starring Vincent Price) appeared in "3-D" while this 1933 version employed Technicolor.******** Mystery of the Wax Museum (2/16/33) Michael Curtiz ~ Lionel Atwill, Glenda Farrell, Fay Wray, Allen Vincent</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Without this movie we probably didn't have had House of Wax with Vincent Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not too long ago I had bought the DVD of House of Wax (1953). After watching that great movie I noticed there was a special feature on it named "Mystery of the Wax Museum". My first thought was it might be some documentary. I was pleasantly surprised it was in fact a full length movie from the thirties. So I decided to give this one a go too.Soon it became clear this was the movie that formed an inspiration for House of Wax. They do basically have the same story. So yes House of Wax is a remake. I prefer the remake because it story was not as rushed as the original, characters were better developed, visually better and Vincent Price was wonderful as the wax artist.This original does have it strong points too. The best thing for me was the energetic character of Glenda Farrell as the female reporter, that I think was the only thing the remake lacked. The wax statues do look very real in this original too. And even though not as good as Price, the artist is here played very well too. I think when his masks falls of he is even scarier than the one in the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Fun that the 1953 Remake. Fay Wray is Terrific!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fay Wray (that gal from "King Kong") plays the hard-boiled blonde newspaper reporter, looking for a story so she can keep her miserable job. She adds an element of humor to what would otherwise be a tedious telling of this now familiar story. In primitive 2-strip Technicolor, which has mostly faded to pastel shades of blue, green, and red. (Often shown in black and white.) Carefully restored by Warner Video, it is clear that they didn't have much of a print to work with. Added TV "breaks" actually help the "view-ability". Many scratches and reel-breaks. It must have been in terrible shape! Pretty-good sets for 1933, it has a "Frankenstein" feel to it in the villain's "mad lair". Some scenes closely copied in the 1953 remake "House of Wax". Here, Igor (Lionel Attwil-who always played "mad" scientists) is the name of the burned sculptor, not the speechless assistant! Only available on the backside of the "House of Wax" Warner DVD, I believe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sinister and anachronistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lionel Atwill, Fay Wray and Glenda Farrell encounter strange goings-on in two-strip Technicolor. Due to the technology, the blending of green and blue actually gives the story a more appropriately sinister look. But it is all very anachronistic. In several scenes, we are met with Miss Farrell acting more like a depression-era news hound than a reporter from an earlier era. Miss Wray also seems to act and look a little too contemporary. But she is very good, though given less screen time than her female costar (despite Wray having higher billing). Director Michael Curtiz often cuts to medium shots of the characters. He seems to realize that the true ambiance of this story does not depend on dramatic close-ups, but rather emanates from the characters and their space filled with bizarre energy. This does not necessarily involve an overdressed set, which is something that does bog down the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the GREATEST and most COLORFUL Hollywood classics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since Warner Brothers' big venture of making the first two-color talkie a horror movie, "Doctor X', had been very successful, it was only logical that the first THREE-color movie, with the colors further developed and more natural, would also be a horror film - and they also went with the slogan 'never change a winning team': again, Michael Curtiz, one of Hollywood's most able directors ever, took on the direction, and cute, pretty Fay Wray and gentle, but somehow sinister-looking Lionel Atwill played the leads. And there also was a curious reporter again - but the female edition this time: Glenda Farrell, who would prove lots of times (most notably as 'Torchy Blane') that she was just IDEAL for the role of the fresh girl reporter! It all begins in London in 1921: uniquely gifted, but also quite eccentric Ivan Igor has created a wonderful House of Wax - which unfortunately is doing pretty badly financially, because he only depicts historical figures like Voltaire, Joan of Arc and Marie Antoinette instead of murderous anti-heroes like Jack the Ripper that the other Houses of Wax expose, making lots of profit from the curiosity of the visitors. So, his partner, a complete ignorant of real art, proposes to 'just' set the whole place on fire in order to collect the fire insurance - and he actually does. Horrified, Igor watches his beloved masterpieces melting and tries to save them; but they're all destroyed - and his hands forever crippled...12 years later, in New York, Igor opens a new Wax Museum; with the help of young artists, since he himself is unable to work anymore - he clearly disapproves of his assistants' 'talents'; and yet, the first great pieces, his Joan of Arc and his Voltaire, are extraordinary works of art again... And at the same time, bodies are being stolen from the morgue, which makes cheeky reporter Florence suspicious - especially since one of them resembled Joan of Arc very much, and another one Voltaire...So she starts sniffing around in the museum, with the help of her friend Charlotte, whose boyfriend is one of Igor's assistants - and when Igor sees Charlotte for the first time, he immediately sees her in his mind's eye as his lost favorite 'Marie Antoinette'...This unforgettable movie, apart from the color-technical innovation that practically led straight to the movies that we are used to nowadays, has literally got EVERYTHING: an unusual, creepy story (which would be imitated quite some times later on), a PERFECT cast and crew, a most 'real' kind of horror (not scientific this time, as in "Doctor X", but dealing with the sometimes narrow borders between genius and insanity, even leading to criminality...) - and, as a contrast, a most lively, realistic and funny depiction of the crazy world of reporters and newsrooms! And besides that, it can be clearly identified as a pre-Code movie, with features like Igor's drug-addicted helper and Florence's quite open talking about men (a year later, the film would never have been granted a seal...) - "Mystery of the Wax Museum" is certainly one of the greatest, most perfect and most memorable of ALL classic Hollywood movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Your Usual Exhibit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good horror flick. I was surprised at how good the color was for 1933. I don't know about the early "two strip" process, but it certainly worked here. Atwill's his usual demented self, this time turning people into wax mannequins for his "museum". Like King Kong of the same year, he's got his eye on Fay Wray. Poor Wray, she always seems to attract the wrong kind of guy. Good thing she's got motor-mouth Glenda Farrell as a chum to stir the pot with the cops. Seems like Atwill's got a policy of hiring the deformed, which may be charitable, but is sort of scary for everyone else.What a great wax tub set WB popped for. The catwalks are a marvel of placement and design making those scenes real eye-catchers. To me, Farrell's light comedy is a matter of taste in a horror movie, but at least it's not clownish. And how did they get their mannequins to pose like blocks of marble for an extended camera period. Apparently they used real people since wax figures melted under the stage lights. Strikes me that remaining stock-still is maybe harder than delivering a bunch of dialog. I hope they got triple pay as a result. Anyway, the movie belongs to the great line-up of 30's horror flicks, maybe not first-rank but close to it, especially when we see the real Igor (pronounced eye-gore). Ugh!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening titles and background look like German Expressionism, as do its frequent use of shadows; film then switches to men in trenchcoats in rain-soaked London streets, giving the film almost a feeling of early film noir.Beautiful Gothic/ art deco sets give the film a wonderful atmosphere. The two-strip Technicolour filming process is very interesting, it gives the film a quiet, subdued feeling. If the colours had been more dramatic, they would have been overpowering and distracting, and the entire affair would have come off as being somewhat comical.I love the tracking shot just before the 12-minute mark, dropping the viewer into the then-present day setting of New Year's Eve, 1933, in snow-covered New York. A simple, basic technique, but it works wonderfully here. Vintage 1930s holiday setting is clever and unusual; had a horror ever been set at the holidays before? The first (or at least, one of the first) horrors to be set in the present day, which was an interesting aspect of it as well- but it also makes it seem quite dated by today's standards.Good enough acting, but nothing too spectacular - truthfully, I think the acting is the only weak link present.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Demented by tragedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the early two strip color features was this horror classic Mystery Of The Wax Museum. This film starts with a prologue where Lionel Atwill gets into a fight with his partner in Paris and the Wax Museum they own there burns down with both sustaining injuries. Like the Phantom Of The Opera Atwill like Lon Chaney and later Claude Rains and Herbert Lom regards his wax statues as a father does a child.Fast forward to twelve years later where after instructing people to work as he did, he's ready to open shop again in New York. But something about Atwill's operation attracts reporter Glenda Farrell who apparently was doing a dress rehearsal for her later Torchy Blane series. Let's say his figures are way too realistic.Fay Wray who is Farrell's friend is put in as much in harm's way as she was with that giant ape on top of the Empire State Building that same year. And speaking of the Phantom Of The Opera the ending of this film was taken right from said source.Atwill like Claude Rains gives a marvelous performance of a man demented by tragedy. He really dominates the scenes he's in. Farrell and Joan Blondell in their time at Warner Brothers played a lot of the same roles. You could have cast Blondell here and it wouldn't be noticed. Fay Wray did well by her part.But despite all in watching Mystery Of The Wax Museum I saw something I never thought I would see in a film. Frank McHugh who plays Farrell's editor actually gets the girl in a film. Now that alone is worth seeing Mystery Of The Wax Museum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great premise, beautiful sets and a superb Atwill makes Mystery of the Wax Museum a winner</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I do like the Vincent Price remake film House of Wax, mainly because of its creepy atmosphere, Price's performance and the fact that it is one of the best 3D experiences I've had, I do consider Mystery of the Wax Museum the superior film. It looks great, with beautiful sets and marvellously evocative Technicolour. The score is haunting without being overbearing, the dialogue is cracking and also wonderfully frank and the story, benefiting from a great premise, zips along very nicely and like House of Wax has a creepy and suspenseful atmosphere. The scene where Fay Wray she cracks Lionel Atwill's false face to reveal the scars beneath is absolute magic. Michael Curtiz keeps things moving while building up the increasing tension, both of which he does splendidly, while the characters especially Ivan Igor are memorable. Fay Wray visually is at her most alluring and does well complete with heart-stopping-worthy screams with her roles. Glenda Farrell is even better, giving her wise-cracking, fast-talking character likability. But the film belongs to Lionel Atwill, who is superb, managing to be menacing and moving. All in all, a winner on all levels. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent early version of "House of Wax"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having never seen this film, I really enjoyed it. The film, known as the first horror film with a contemporary setting was pretty scary. One scene, set in a morgue, will give you goosebumps. Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray are the stars of the picture and do their usual good job, but for me the film was just about stolen by Glenda Farrell as a wise-cracking reporter. It's rare for a horror film when you can be frightened one minute, and laugh out loud the next. Glenda's scene with what is discovered in the coffin will give you a few good laughs. This film also has the distinction of being the last film made in the two-color Technicolor process which adds to the atmosphere of the film. The print itself is in pretty good shape for a film so old, and, as a companion piece for the "House of Wax" DVD, it stands up pretty well on it's own merit. An entertaining 77 minutes that zips by quickly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bright and sassy horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery of the Wax Museum is in many ways a typical Warner Bros. production of the time. Fast-paced, with plenty of action, newsroom scenes and snappy one-liners, Director Michael Curtiz tops his horror outing of the previous year, Doctor X, with this memorable shocker.Lionel Atwill stars as Ivan Igor, a master sculptor who falls victim to an unscrupulous financial partner. In London, 1921, Igor tries to stop his wax museum from being burned to ground in an insurance scam but receives terrible burns in the process (just how terrible we don't realise until the final reel!); however by 1933 he has now set up in New York, and on the eve of the opening of his new establishment a wise-acre reporter (Glenda Farrell) begins to suspect that recent murder victims stolen from the morgue may be being put to a macabre use...The DVD restoration of this two-colour movie is great. Fay Wray never looked lovelier as the mild heroine, but it's Farrell and Atwill who are the stars of the show. Farrell is genuinely likable as the hard-nosed female crime reporter and Atwill is terrific, generating both pathos and menace as Igor. Director Curtiz throws in lots of expressionistic shots and quick cuts into the mix, and the result is a superb concoction. A huge hit at box office, it was remade (very well) in 1953 as House Of Wax, and set Vincent Price up for a lucrative horror career, and a few years ago a version featuring Paris Hilton appeared! I haven't seen the latter....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having seen almost every other waxwork horror movie before finally seeing this one, or so it felt anyway, I did not know quite what to expect. Luckily, I was in for quite a treat.Lionel Atwill plays the sculptor who has his hands damaged in a tragic fire, a man who cares passionately about every lifelike figure he creates and who will go to any lengths to get just the right look for his waxen figures. Or so it would seem. Fay Wray is a damsel unfortunate enough to look like a figure that Atwill wants to recreate. And Glenda Farrell is a wisecracking reporter who stumbles on to the facts that may eventually lead her to uncover something amiss at the new wax museum.Directed by Michael Curtiz, Mystery Of The Wax Museum holds up well today thanks to it's great premise and great performances. Okay, Farrell annoyed the heck out of me but she's only playing the type of role that we've seen in so many other movies from this era, even if this particular character seems extra annoying. Wray is given little to do but looks fine doing it and Atwill is simply superb as Ivan Igor, the sculptor who lost his talented hands. Everyone else does well in their roles though I can't say I recognised any of them, which means they did little else of note or I simply need to see many more black &amp; white films.It's easy to see why this concept was embraced by the genre and remade/repackaged often. Waxworks, like dolls, have a natural creepiness to them thanks to their aspiration to be lifelike. This movie, and many afterwards, exploits that notion and does it well.See this if you like: House Of Wax, House Of Wax (2005), Waxworks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though this film boasts Lionel Atwill in the lead role, your appreciation of the story might rest on the shoulders of Glenda Farrell in her portrayal of the fast talking, wise cracking reporter Florence Dempsey from the New York Express. Her frenetic energy keeps the picture moving once we get beyond the opening scene set in 1921 London, when Ivan Igor's (Atwill) struggling Wax Museum is torched by it's co-owner for an insurance payoff. It certainly looked to me like Igor was a goner in the blaze that ensued, but then the story would have ended right there. Instead, the wheel chair bound Igor resurfaces in New York City, in a wax museum recreating notable characters and scenes from a decade earlier.When you get right down to it, the picture covers a lot of ground with it's treatment of murder, body snatching, boot-legging and drug use. I was actually a little startled to hear the term 'junkie' in the film in reference to Igor's associate Professor Darcy (Arthur Edmund Carewe). Could that have been the first time in film? Not only that, in an early scene at the police station, reporter Flo asks one of the cops about his sex life! Pre-Code was pretty interesting to say the least!Watching "Doctor X" and "Mystery of the Wax Museum" back to back today, I was surprised to see how different Lionel Atwill looked in pictures made only a year apart. His character here looks much older and frankly, smaller than the title character of the earlier film. I don't think it would be too much of a stretch to say he looked like two different actors. The other oddity I noticed was how similar the municipal morgue in both pictures appeared to be from street level, almost as if the same set was used. Anyone? I can't say that the revelation of Igor as the mastermind behind all the skulduggery at the Wax Museum came as a surprise, but the scene that revealed the wax face covering up those decade earlier burns was a neat touch. The header into the boiling vat was also clever, and particularly fitting. The only thing that could have made it all better would have been a final fade out where Ivan Igor ends up as one of the exhibits. Where was Rod Serling when you needed him?</fullReview>

Comedy aside this is a creepy movie with the off key color helping it greatly.You know the drill, wounded wax sculptor reopens his wax museum just as some fiend begins stealing dead bodies from the morgue, is there a connection? Lionel Atwill plays the sculptor, Faye Wray the object of his eye. The movie is fast moving and a lot of fun. When the unmasking scene finally happens its both horrifying and incredibly sad, the villain playing it with a just a touch of pathos missing from Price's film. The horror is undercut by the fact that we see the makeup early in the film, which is creepy but undermines the shock at the end.An old creepy creaky classic.</fullReview>

His hands are not the same, so he can't actually sculpt the wax figures anymore. You can guess where the shapes come from.

		<shortDescription>Classic horror film in two-strip Technicolor!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the early '30s, when Universal were riding high with Frankenstein and Dracula, Warners hunted round for their own horror subject, and found one in the idea of a sculptor who murders his models and embalms them in wax to achieve death-in-life. Bet you didn't know that the "original" House of Wax was a remake! Here's the real original (in fact, it was a play even before this), a 1933 film that is strikingly similar to the Vincent Price horror film, but which also borrows heavily from then-popular vampire movies. Lionel Atwill plays the Price part, but Fay Wray is more memorable as the wannabe gumshoe who's on the case of the local wax museum and why its wax figures have an uncanny resemblance to the recently dead.It's an interesting Poe-like theme, full of bizarre implications, and has since been remade several times (once in 3-D); but this remains the classic. Filmed in one of the earliest two-tone Technicolor processes, it is beautiful to look at, full of muted green compositions and stunningly modulated color effects. Interesting, too, to note that its tough, wisecracking girl reporter (Farrell) and newspaper setting bear the unmistakable stamp of the Warner house style. There's a slightly cruel, almost fascist streak throughout, especially in the police's handling of things, and the shocks are a little sparse by present standards. But it holds up amazingly well, and its pale, shimmering images linger in the mind.However, controversy will always continue about which movie version of Charles Belden's play is more effective, the 1933 rendering or the later 3-D version. Mystery of the Wax Museum is set at the time of its making rather than at the turn-of-the-century, taking away a little of the period mood; but it has more strikingly frightening sets, many of them, especially those of the museum's basement, displaying marked elements of German Expressionism in their design.Both films follow the same general outline, the opening sequence in the two films being almost identical. The professor this time is named Ivan Igor and played Lionel Atwell, who played a whole string of nefarious characters in the thirties and forties. Although Atwell doesn't seem quite as sinister as Price, he's got a great speaking voice. The biggest difference between the movies is in the lead female character. Instead of the relatively helpless young lady of the later film, this older one features a breezy, fast-talking, hard-drinking newspaperwoman named Flo Dempsey, played by Glenda Farrell. In this regard, the movie's quick-paced dialogue makes it a combination The Front Page and Frankenstein, representing two genres picking up steam in the early thirties.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy vintage horror movie with a sympathetic fiend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Mystery of the Wax Museum" is typical of early thirties horror films in combining the fetid atmosphere of the silent German Expressionistic classics with a villain who holds audience sympathy. The result is a more complex viewing experience than the more modern and purely frightening shockers muster.Filmed in an early two-strip Technicolor process that paints in pastels and is heavy on green, the plot begins in a London wax museum in 1921. Ivan Igor is a talented, if eccentric and even perhaps harmlessly unbalanced, sculptor who talks with his creations as real people. His show is not doing well as he strives for art and does not pander to the lurid tastes of the public. His greedy partner sets fire to the museum in order to collect the insurance money. Igor watches in impotent horror as his wax friends melt before his eyes and in the end is trapped in the conflagration. Twelve years later Igor is in New York, opening another wax museum. There have been strange goings on in the city. Prominent people have vanished and corpses have been stolen from the morgue. Ace reporter Florence Dempsey is hot on the trail of one of the missing corpses and her investigation takes her to Igor's wax museum and to the macabre solution to the mystery, which also involves her beautiful roommate.The plot is convoluted with three romantic subplots slowing the pace, but the movie offers an interesting snapshot of 1933 New York, with drug addiction, bootlegging, suicide, gangsterism, plus the callous attitudes of the police and reporters, adding grit to the story. There is a striking contrast between the depiction of everyday life and the Gothic horror found inside the wax museum.The supporting cast does well. The various police officers really seem like police officers. Frank McHugh makes an abrasive editor. Gavin Gordon is a spoiled rich boy involved in a possible murder. Edwin Maxwell convinces as the crooked partner still operating on the nether side of the law. Arthur Edmund Carewe adds intensity as a drug addict who does the sculpturing for the crippled Igor. Glenda Farrell is attractive and handles the snappy patter well. She carries the movie for long stretches. While the go-get-em female reporter became a cliché in the late thirties and forties, I'm not aware of an earlier incarnation than this movie.Lionel Atwill plays Ivan Igor and he gives the performance of his life. His childlike guilelessness and enthusiasm in the opening scene is infectious and wins the audience to his side. He plays the older Igor with unwavering dignity, and unlike Vincent Price in the remake, never abandons his artistic principles. The palpable shame etched by his body language when his scarred face is exposed in the unmasking scene is moving.Fay Wray is confined to a supporting role. She does not appear until a half hour into the movie and has only a few brief scenes before confronting Atwill at the climax in the wax museum. She is nevertheless vital to the movie. She is beautiful enough to make Igor's obsession with her plausible. Her terrorized reaction when Igor's wax mask falls off is all anyone could hope for and really sells the scene.The movie also boasts an excellent production design by Anton Grot. The London wax museum, the morgue, the basement in Worth's building, and the cavernous basement of the wax museum with its odd lighting and looming shadows give the movie an unsettling creepiness. Michael Curtiz and his moving camera do a good job of exploiting the sets.All in all, a vintage horror classic that is well worth seeing for anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1930's mystery in beautiful colours</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Mystery of the Wax Museum is a beautiful looking film made with 2-strip Technicolor. Its sickening to think that it was lost till the 1960's. This is one of veteran Hungarian director Michael Curtiz's most visually striking films. I admired the visual look of his films when I first saw the Errol Flynn version of The Adventures of Robin Hood. The colors of Mystery of the Wax Museum are just as good. The set design - especially the early parts set in London - are wonderful. These old films are just like old cars of that period - they just don't make them like that anymore! There is a Vincent Price version made 20 years after this which is almost as good for different reasons. The approaches taken by the two films are quite different although the inspiration for both was Charles Bledden's stage play The Wax Works. Mystery of the Wax Museum is just that - a mystery. Although the narrative structure is much more confusing (which may be because of lost scenes), at least Mystery of the Wax Museum remains a whodunit till the end. There is no horror in this version and its surprisingly undated. The dialog is quite frank e.g. female reporter enters newsroom and the first question she asks her editor is "How's your sex life?". I guess the Hays Code hadn't fully set in. The fast-talking newspaper characters are a bit stereotyped which was typical for the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Overshadowed by its 1953 remake 'House of Wax', this film is much better and yet rarely seen. Shot in primitive Technicolor, and starring Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray, it is much less concerning with 'shocking' the viewer and instead, becomes a fast-moving, clever, and genuinely suspenseful thriller.Happily, this film is now available as an extra on the 'House of Wax' DVD, although it isn't really publicised on the packaging. Both films are of identical length.'Mystery' also has the benefit of Glenda Farrell as the wisecracking reporter hungry for a case, in the mould of later girl reporters like Rosalind Russell in 'His Girl Friday'. Atwill and Wray are also both excellent. A film to savour over and over, and unjustly forgotten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many aspects I like this film better than the second remake. I really liked the female reporter angle as opposed to just a nosey girlfriend. I also liked it taking place in "modern day" rather than the turn of the century in England. The two movies are almost identical story wise with several scenes being shot almost identically, even the same lines were used most of the time. The sets were very stylistic, borrowing from the deco period and even German Expresionism. Fay Wray was charming as was Glenda Farrel. Those two dames walk away with this picture. The Technicolor was very drab and I found it to be somewhat distracting at times. Overall a very good film without the silliness of the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Glory of Two Strip Technicolor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wax sculptor Ivan Igor receives an invitation from the London Royal Art Academy to have his wax statues (comprising mainly of historical figures) displayed. That's the good news, the bad news is that because of a lack of interest of historical sculptures, his museum is losing money, and his partner in the museum, Worth, plans to destroy the museum, statues and all, in order to collect the fire insurance. Igor scoffs at the notion, but Worth carries out his idea and leaves Igor in the inferno to watch his life's work get destroyed. Twelve years later, Igor opens a museum in New York, but because his hands were severely burned in the fire, he requires the need of sculptors to recreate his works under his guidance. One of Igor's assistants, Ralph Burton, brings his fiance Charlotte, and her roommate, newspaper writer Florence to the museum, where Florence believes one of Igor's statues is the exact image of Joan Gale, a woman who recently died of an overdose at a New Year's Party, in fact too good an image. That's nothing compared to Charlotte, who Igor sees as the exact image of his Marie Antoinette figure and Igor wants to capture Charlotte's beauty..... forever. A decent movie, most notable for its use of the Two-Strip Technicolor process. The cast is good, most notable Atwill as Igor. Wray is bland as Charlotte, and Farrell is just giving a preview of her Torchy Blane series, but more annoyingly. Curtiz direction is very uneven, mainly at the beginning after the fire scene it seems like various sequences put together, and not really creating any interest. The last scenes of the film are very good, and really the only time the film generates any excitement or suspense. It would have been nice to have the Igor vs. Worth plotline worked on more in the film. Remade in 1953 as House of Wax. Rating, 6.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>STILL A CLASSIC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One must keep in mind that at this point we're talking about a 71-year-old movie - its basic plot elements and style were a little bit fresher in 1933.The film we're seeing today is not quite the film movie-goers saw in 1933 when, aside from the extra attraction of two-color Technicolor and the 'horror' element, it was just another mystery film on the busy Warner Bros. production schedule, just another film its director, Michael Curtiz, had no choice about making (he went on to a little number called CASABLANCA a decade later). Glenda Farrell played the kind of role she was known for - funny and fast-talking - and played in any number of other films of the era. So a historical perspective is necessary. The color has been faded and washed out over the years, though I think the folks at Warner Home Video 'tweaked' it for DVD - at one point Fay Wray wears a dress that's very definitely BLUE on the DVD - and blue was a color which did NOT register in the 2-color Technicolor process - check out the videocassette and you'll see the difference (the dress was green). Considered 'lost' after a few sparse showings in the 1940s, WAX MUSEUM didn't surface again until 1970, when younger enthusiasts who had learned of the film through Famous Monsters of Filmland Magazine and other periodicals finally got to release the breath we'd been holding for years, hoping a print would surface and we'd get a chance to see our 'lost' classic. I was one of those in attendance at one of the very first showings, in September 1970 at Alice Tully Hall in New York City. I still get a kick out of this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film late last night, and while it held my attention, I did not find it nearly as enjoyable as many of the other horror films of the era (Bride of Frankenstein, Dracula, etc.). First of all, the comic relief provided by Glenda Farrell seemed out of place, serving only to lessen the effectiveness of the film. Fay Wray's part was largely underdeveloped, and she appeared only in the last half of the movie.(possible spoiler ahead)Nonetheless, this movie had its moments, especially the part where Fay Wray slaps off Lionel Atwill's wax face! The creepy storyline also added to my enjoyment. Therefore, I give this movie 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply good for 1933 horror.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a big Michael Curtiz fan, I still didn't think he could pull off a good horror movie. "Mystery of the Wax Museum" is however one fine maintaining early horror movie, shot in 2-strip Technicolor. A surprising turn from Michael Curtiz, as well as from the Warner Bros. studios, who of course weren't and still aren't exactly known for their horror movie productions.It's a typical horror movie for its era, that perhaps best can be compared to an early Phantom of the Opera movie, in terms of its atmosphere and story-telling. It's not just being an horror movie but also and perhaps foremost a mystery movie, also hence the title "Mystery of the Wax Museum", that sounds more like a detective movie than a scary horror perhaps.It's a slow and perhaps not always told well story but overall the movie holds your interest and the movie is simply a good one to watch, from start till finish.The fact that this movie is shot in color also gives the movie an extra dimension. It's always special to see a movie made with '30's techniques and acting in color. It gives the movie a special atmosphere, from which it benefits. The look of the movie is great and as you can expect from a Curtiz movie it has some great cinematography. There are some trademark Michael Curtiz moments in this movie as well but as a whole it also is quite obvious that this is still an early Hollywood movie by him. Yet this movie was perhaps his big breakthrough and opened the doors for him to make many big, grand Hollwyood epics in the second halve of the '30's.The movie stars Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray in the main leads. Two actors who were yet to become big stars. Fay Wray managed this of course in the same year with her role in "King Kong", which made her immortal. Lionel Atwill would continue later on to star in many big Universal Studio's horror productions, till his death in 1946.For 1933 it's simply a fine, though slightly flawed, horror production.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong and influential horror film, pre-censorship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is one of those '30s grand guignol-style horror films that I so love, and as an added bonus it's filmed in Technicolor, which makes it pretty unique. Seeing actresses and actors such as Fay Wray and Lionel Atwill starring in full colour makes a refreshing change from their typical greyscale performances so the film wins points for novelty value alone. For those looking for originality, it would probably be best to try elsewhere, as MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM's plot has been re-used so frequently since its concept that it now seems familiar and a little stale. There was a decent '50s remake with Vincent Price called HOUSE OF WAX and a remake of that remake with the same name in the early 2000s. Add in all the countless B-movies and Z-flicks like NIGHTMARE IN WAX (even Mexican wrestler Santo visited a wax museum for one outing) and you have a movie that leaves you feeling a little fidgety despite the short running time.Anyway, it's business as usual for a '30s horror, with strong direction and great style. The art design is spot on and the waxworks are effortlessly spooky in themselves. This was made just before the onslaught of film censorship so it's intriguing to see drug addicts featuring in the cast. The performances are uniformly excellent, with Lionel Atwill reminding us of why he was one of the true titans of horror ? a man who deserved his crown every bit as much as Boris Karloff and Bela Lugosi until his virtual blacklisting around 1940. Fay Wray's lovely too, although her role here amounts to an extended cameo, if that. While the others can't be faulted, I did find Glenda Farrell's brash reporter to be pretty irritating ? this is no criticism of the actress but rather the script, which overdoes her rattling dialogue and smug nature ? I found myself wanting to chuck her in the vat of boiling wax rather than Atwill! There are plenty of good horrible moments, some of them inspired by German expressionist works as disfigured, be-cloaked figures in dark hats wander around bodysnatching and the police are always one step behind. There's an iconic 'unmasking' scene which is only slightly lessened by the fact that we've seen Atwill's face before ? bad move, filmmakers ? and a classic ending which was memorably spoofed in CARRY ON SCREAMING. This is a film that horror lovers and fans of classic cinema will enjoy no matter what as one of the highlights of the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM has a lot going for it, not the least of which are sterling performances from Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray (whose part should've been that of the reporter...). The ever-reliable Atwill is, here, another of those sympathetic monsters it's kinda hard to dislike: what happens to him isn't HIS fault; it's the underhanded actions of his sleazy business partner that are to blame. The fistfights in MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM are all topnotch: whoever choreographed them knew his stuff. The ending is classic (and may well have inspired the Joker's swan dive into a vat of chemicals in Tim Burton's BATMAN) and doesn't skimp on the Horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was not a fan of 'Mystery of the Wax Museum'. It was meant to be a horror film, but got more than a little confused with a mix of awkward comic relief and romance added along the way. It tries to do too many things at once, and ends up doing a mediocre job at all of them. An example of this early on was a dopey comedic bit when the morgue robber sits up under a sheet and the orderlies stupidly shrug it off as the effect of embalming or the nature of women (double 'ugh', and this loses all opportunity for tension in the scene).Fay Wray plays a streetwise, fast-talking, tough reporter who varied between grating and interesting to me. Its pre-Code which allows her to bust off lines like "Hi sweetheart, how's your sex life?", to a male colleague, and after seeing the risqué cover of his copy of 'Naughty Stories', saying "uh-oh". Later she tells a guy to "go to a warm place, and I don't mean California." Unfortunately for all that, her 'detective work is quite simplistic'; she's on to the secret of the Wax Museum far too easily, finding morgue tags still on one of the exhibits.There is no real suspense or sophistication here, just a hodge-podge, and while there are creepy scenes, they're few and far between. I liked the fact the film was shot in the emerging 'Two-tone Technicolor' technology, which in some ways adds to the eeriness of some of the early scenes, before the script starts getting in the way of the whole thing.This one may have camp appeal and provide some entertainment, but for a truly great horror film from the time period, try 1932's 'Dr. Jekyl and Mr. Hyde' instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The great Lionel Atwill plays Ivan Igor, renowned sculptor in 1921 London whose partner Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell) attempts to burn down their business for the insurance. 12 years later, Igor is trying to make another go of it, opening another wax museum in NYC. Meanwhile, people are beginning to disappear from the streets, and reporter Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell), a very pushy type if ever there was one, sniffs out the story.While the 1953 remake "House of Wax" had the 3-D gimmick going for it, this reasonably entertaining shocker is interesting in its own way. Most striking is the use of a two-colour Technicolor process, which really brings the great Anton Grot sets to life. While horror elements don't come into play that often in this version of the tale, there are some creepy and fun moments as a stranger with a horrible visage prowls around, and helps themselves to dead bodies. Clocking in at a fairly trim 78 minutes, "Mystery of the Wax Museum" may not appeal to horror fans across the board, especially with its strong accent on comedy and rapid fire, witty dialogue. But some of that dialogue *is* pretty priceless. There are moments where a music score would have been useful, but director Michael Curtiz is still able to create some tension and suspense. The makeup effects by Ray Romero and Perc Westmore are superb.Lovely Fay Wray is put in peril here, and screams quite well, in this film from the same year as "King Kong". Gavin Gordon is likable as rich kid George Winton, who falls under suspicion of murder. Arthur Edmund Carewe is quite good as the drug addicted Professor Darcy. But the film truly belongs to Atwill, at his delicious, villainous best, and the brassy Farrell. Her lively performance may be a matter of taste, but she adds undeniable energy, especially when she's sparring with her long suffering editor Jim (Frank McHugh).Overall, a fine entertainment.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery of the Wax Museum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much like Michael Curtiz' other Warners Technicolor film, starring Lionel Atwill and Faye Wray (who establishes her sex appeal and screaming abilities in both films), Dr. X (1932), Mystery of the Wax Museum has a major problem with pacing, a talky script, and quick-talking news reporter trying to rob the horror of the plot with her comic hi-jinx. Glenda Farrell is the chatty, relationship-plagued, and snap-talking reporter, friends with Wray who is dating a sculptor played by Frank McGugh. Similarities to Vincent Price's film include a scrupulous, slimy money-man burning down the wax museum of master sculptor (in this film, the capably understated Atwill who had a way of not hamming it up, showing nuance and ache without overdoing it) to get fire insurance (resulting in the sculptor supposedly having his hands burned and confining him to a wheelchair), the girlfriend of his employee (Wray who once again screams a lot, particularly at the end) eyed by the mad sculptor to be his "new" Antionette "model" (to live immortal), a junkie employee of the sculptor who winds up informing to the police on him, and the finale inside the elaborately designed wax sculpting machine, built to manufacture dead stolen corpses into dummies for the London museum. Where this film fails and the Price film succeeded was in alleviating the snail-crawling lulls that stifle this from being a real gem. Atwill is fine, while Wray is pretty. I'm always a sucker for a horror film set at a wax museum with a mad sculptor, and this one you might call the granddaddy of the genre that produced others like House of Wax, Horrors of the Black Museum, Nightmare in Wax, etc. Too much Farrell, and not enough Atwill, does this film no favors. Insisting to follow the news reporter was a Warner Bros. standard, and so much emphasis on snappy banter between him/her and the cops and news paper editor (and staff) would often deter from the horror plot that us fans were (are) truly interested in. The film is very persistent in showing Farrell always flirting and at odds with her editor- in-chief; the ending where they get together is a bit eye-rolling. There's a subplot involving her and an affluent London playboy (wrongfully arrested and later acquitted in the murder of a woman Atwill steals for his Joan of Arc wax dummy). It is very easy for the attention to drift away from the film as characters talk, talk, talk. The breaking of the wax face to reveal the horrific Max Factor facial burn makeup for Atwill is still potent, even though the synthetic flesh Moon Killer's ugly visage was a bit more pronounced. Once again, the work of art designer Anton Grot doesn't disappoint, particularly when Wray ventures deep into the building of Atwill's museum and workshop. Lots of odd angular architecture. As a film of importance in art / set design and high quality camera work, both Doctor X and Mystery of the Wax Museum fit the bill, and I think horror fans of the classic period should check them out. You will have to sit through a lot of yackety-yak, though, in order to enjoy them. The early color process is quite eyepopping. I think we are fortunate that both Curtiz films were found, still exist, and are available for us to experience anew.I think Price's film better serves justice to the man that ruined the sculptor's life for a little insurance money, trying to recoup a sum for supposedly sinking his money in a lost cause. We get to see the dirtbag get it good in Price's film, while Atwill just balks at the wooden case holding the dead body. Also there's a lot more of burn-face ghoul, night prowler Price than Atwill. Wray's beauty and obvious sex appeal are quite understood by Warners. She'd be immortalized in King Kong, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Vincent Price starring 1953 vehicle "House of Wax" happens to be a remake of "The Mystery of the Wax Museum", which I think both are equally as good as each other. I haven't seen the 2005 remake though, which has draw-card (well I guess that depends on your viewpoint?) Paris Hilton appearing. I got it, but haven't got around to it. Nonetheless lets get back to the stepping "The Mystery of Wax Museum"; it's a smartly epitome, but ghastly little Gothic shocker that atmospherically builds upon its vivid art direction (with two-strip technicolour bringing it alive), artistic shades and wickedly enliven mystery at a quick pace. The performances are spot-on. Lionel Atwill is effectively good as sculptor Ivan Igor and golden age scream siren Fay Wray is quite buoyant as a snoopy newspaper reporter who's suspicious of his work. The script is quite a sharp one with an underlining dark edge to it, especially the upfront humour and the drug angle. From the get-go director Michael Curtiz makes great use of the stellar idea to provoke macabre, like the wax melting scenes --- namely the final one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror film that would have been a musical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...if the musical films of the early 30's had not fallen in such ill favor. Warner Brothers had contracted with the Technicolor corporation to make two more color films, and these were always musicals in those days. When that didn't pan out as economically feasible Warners decided to make two color horror films instead - this one and "Doctor X".Mystery of the Wax Museum is one of those rare depression-era films that availed itself of two-strip technicolor. It is a good example of a saucy pre-code film with dicey language that has a journalist investigating what turns out to be a horror story. In this way it compares well to 1932's "Doctor X". In this version, Glenda Farrell is really the lead as the fast-talking journalist who just knows that a recently opened wax museum is behind disappearances in the local morgue, and is out to prove it. She plays something you won't see for another 30 years in American cinema starting in 1934 - a hard-boiled girl with an equally hard-boiled mouth. For example, while searching for clues she walks up to a cop friend of hers, grabs the magazine from his hand and asks him "How's your sex life?". The now more famous Fay Wray actually has a minor role as the beautiful girl friend of the apprentice sculptor who plays the part of damsel in distress. Other than this small part at the end of the film she really has little to do here. Farrell carries the lead role well, but I kept thinking that if Ginger Rogers had been available perhaps she could have really made this role sizzle a bit more .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>London 1921, and brilliant sculptor Ivan Igor struggles to keep his museum open due to lack of interest in his beautiful historical characters. His partner Joe Worth feels it's time to call it quits, a row over finances ensues and a fire breaks out and burns the museum to the ground, almost killing Igor in the process. On to 1933 and New York, where the wheelchair bound Igor has a new museum open, the figures sculpted by others under his guidance due to his horribly disfigured hands preventing him from crafting himself. When a female socialite dies and her body is stolen from the morgue, ballsy reporter Florence Dempsey starts to investigate. Could it be that the stealing of the body is linked to the opening of Igor's new museum?.Mystery of the Wax Museum was long thought to have had it's elements lost in a {ironically} fire, so with no Technicolor negative or prints available, it was a cinematic godsend that a used print was discovered in Jack Warner's private vault. The UCLA Film and Television Archive restored the film, and now the film can be seen in all its former glory. Riding in on a high reputation, the restored film was met with less than favourable results by the critics, possibly due in some part to the rightful regard that the remake, House Of Wax 1953, was held. What it is safe to say is that the film is more of a mystery {the clue is in the title!} than an outright horror. Something I don't think many were prepared for.The critics derision back then is now on reflection, stupid. For it's a truly fine film from an interesting era in film making. The sets from Anton Grot are brilliant, Gothic pieces of work. While the performance of Lionel Atwill {Igor} is superb, and arguably his best work. The actress' do well enough, Fay Wray {reuniting with Atwill again after their work in Dr X in 1932} as Charlotte Duncan hones her scream queen method, and Glenda Farrell is ebullient and sharp tongued as Dempsey. There's also daring themes involved in the story, necrophilia, drug addiction, insanity and bootlegging. With the horror elements of the piece born out by the grizzly secrets of Igor's museum. It's also not just an important film in the pantheon of colour pictures, but also in that it has a modern city setting. Helping to bring horror to the streets instead of some ye olde village or faraway castle. It's a smashing mystery/horror film that is now thankfully widely available on various DVDs, see it if you can. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy goings on at the wax museum</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery of the Wax Museum is a very creepy chiller from 1933 and was one of the first movies to be shot in colour.To claim insurance money, the owner of a wax museum in London tries to prevent his partner from burning it down but fails. Several years later, the owner opens up another wax museum in New York. But there is something different about the models in this one, he uses dead bodies and covers them in wax. A reporter realises this and the police become involved after bodies go missing from a mortuary. The owner then tries to get a girl to become his main "model", the reporter's friend.This movie is creepy throughout and the early colour shooting is done quite well.The excellent cast includes horror regulars of the time Lionel Atwill (Doctor X, The Vampire Bat, House of Dracula) and King Kong's "bride" Fay Wray (who also starred with Atwill in The Vampire Bat). Also starring Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh (Mighty Joe Young).Mystery of the Wax Museum is a must for all horror collectors. Excellent.Rating: 3 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Torchy Blane and not bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Glenda Farrell as a snoopy reporter thwarting the police to get her big story. Sound familiar? It's obvious that Glenda Farrell's feisty character in "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" was the basis for the popular Torchy Blane series. But here the similarities end. For those who have only seen the later Wax Museum movies, particularly the popular Vincent Price 3-D version of the early 1950's, you're in for a treat. The original stands on its own as an eerie, scary film. Lionel Atwill as Ivan Igor is truly ghoulish. He may not have quite the suave and sophistication of Vincent Price but his acting is just as effective. Fay Wray is there for the screams she did so well, following her success in "Mister X." The same year she would be immortalized for her role in the classic "King Kong." The comedy is a bit out of date, but there's isn't much of it to distract from the horror and frights. The 2-strip Technicolor makes the film appear bleached as if it were colorized by Turner, but it is still more effective than if the film were shot in standard black and white. Take heed that this is a 1933 Hollywood film. So it contains sexism and there is one comment that would be considered racist today. Just be tolerant and enjoy this masterful mad curator flick directed by Michael Curtiz who would go on to direct the quintessential 40's film "Casablanca."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly, 1933 in 2C color. If you've seen House of Wax, you've seen this one. The scenes are almost identical. The assistant is a junkie instead of an alkie in this one and the Glenda Farrell character is an interesting idea not present in the later edition. (Her decision to marry at the end was out of the blue, however.) It's 10 mins. shorter but just a good except for the absence of the 3D which was amazing in the later edition. Saw it today on TCM.

		<shortDescription>A potential masterpiece never realized.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like the classic KING KONG, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM is set in 1933 New York City, stars Fay Wray, has a monster (of sorts) and is produced by a major studio. But there the similarity ends; WAX MUSEUM is an opportunity lost and a potential masterpiece never realized.WAX MUSEUM opens with thunder and lightening, and the clip-clop of horses in the street late on a rainy night. Alone with his exhibits in his wax museum, Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill) is confronted by his larcenous partner Joe Worth (Edwin Maxwell). Worth reminds Igor of their financial insolvency caused by Igor's refusal to create and display sensational wax exhibits, then suggests a way to solve their financial dilemma.Atwill is perfectly cast as Igor the demented sculptor. Fay Wray, sensuous as ever, plays the vulnerable Charlotte Duncan in a seemingly bit part, the ingenue upon whom Igor seeks to bestow the benefits of immortality in wax. The scene where Atwill attempts to console the horrified Wray that she will remain beautiful forever as a recreated wax statue of Marie Antoinette is unforgettable.The plot develops adequately and reaches a satisfactory conclusion, ably accented by the musical score. The film has the familiar ambience of the 30s with abrupt entrances into plot and character situations and brash, sappy dialogue. But one incidental role undermines all else: that of Florence Dempsey (Glenda Farrell), a newspaper reporter whose assignment is investigating the strange activities at the wax museum, including corpses missing from the morgue. Farrell's role competes for screen time with the principal leads, yet serves little purpose other than so-called comic relief. The character's inane contrivances could be tolerated, but Farrell's dialogue is the problem, a relentless tirade of stupid slang words and metaphors bellowed in a raspy squeaking voice. This constant wisecracking quickly becomes irritating and intrusive, obviously inserted for no other purpose than to distract from the main plot and diminish the film's mood and effect. Farrell's overscripted character should have been deleted or composited into Wray's Charlotte Duncan, with Wray playing the role as a serious ingenue as was done after a fashion in its remake, HOUSE OF WAX. It would have at least saved the film.The real "mystery" of WAX MUSEUM is the faulty script when everything else was right for this production: impressive two-strip technicolor, Atwill and Wray as leads and talented director Michael Curtiz (Yankee Doodle Dandy, Casablanca) at the helm. Warners seemingly intended to make a truly fascinating and frightening film, yet sabotaged its own efforts by adding needless distractions and contrivances for almost half the picture.In conclusion, I would rate the film as worth watching now that its biggest flaw is identified, especially for Atwill's performance along with the other positive aspects of the picture. After watching it, you will know why Warners put it on the remake list right away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Thought The Remake In 1953 Was Better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was remade 20 years later as "House of Wax," with Vincent Price in the role of the wax artist played in this original by Lionel Atwill. Interestingly - because (a) I don't usually care that much for remakes, and (b) I'm not big on Vincent Price - I thought the remake was the stronger of the two movies. Many won't agree with me on that, of course, but "House of Wax" was one of Price's better performances, and I found this version somewhat lacking in both atmosphere and suspense. The story is the same with only a few adjustments, but I felt it was pulled off better in '53.The cast didn't really blow me away. The most interesting thing about the cast was probably the opportunity to see Fay Wray in a movie other than "King Kong." But as Charlotte, her role was - similar to "Kong" - not a substantive acting performance. She looked both beautiful and vulnerable, so you hope she's going to be OK (and she does get to do a Fay Wray scream toward the end!), but I didn't find her performance particularly powerful. And, of course, she wasn't the lead actress. That would have been Glenda Farrell as Florence, the hard-nosed female reporter for the New York Express newspaper. Farrell was probably the strongest member of the cast. She pulled off the role well, and was quite believable for the most part.A major problem with this movie was the last scene. The ending of a movie (which I won't give away, although it's not all that important to the overall story) has to somehow connect to the rest of the movie - otherwise it just leaves me scratching my head. I was left scratching my head after this was over. I thought the writers made a very poor decision in coming up with a final scene that seemed both forced (between the actors) and artificial (between the characters.) I won't say more, except to say that it left me dry, which is not the way you should be left after watching a movie. (5/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lionel Atwill is an obsessed artist who becomes infatuated with using Fay Wray as his own Marie Antoinette wax figure. I like this one and feel it's nicely directed by Michael Curtiz. Atwill has one of his best villain roles, and it's a treat seeing this in early two-strip technicolor. I enjoyed Fay Wray in KING KONG, but some of her staged screams at the climax of this film never fail to make me chuckle. The tough-talking female reporter here (Glenda Farrell) can be irritating at times, but she also adds a strong woman character to the proceedings. This was remade in 1953 as HOUSE OF WAX, starring Vincent Price in the Lionel Atwill role, and filmed in 3-D. It's a worthy remake that is also recommended. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful work of art that needs more recognition!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery of the Wax Museum, a beautiful technicolour mystery, tells the tale of an eccentric wax artist, Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill, Son of Frankenstein), turned mad after his corrupt landlord sets fire to his shop and all of his beautiful work. Igor is left behind to burn in the blaze. Alive, but disfigured, he escapes the fire and sets out to begin his work all over again, this time in the public eye of New York. Due to his burned &amp; damaged hands, however, he cannot perform is own work and instead oversees the sculpting of other, less talented artists.As time passes, bodies begin to disappear from the local morgue and newspaper reporter Charlotte Duncan (Fay Wray, King Kong) takes up the investigation. After noticing a similarity between a missing corpse and a wax figure, Charlotte becomes suspicious of Igor and his new museum. Even more dangerous, her friend Florence (Glenda Farrell, Little Caesar), the fiancée of one of Igor's subordinates, soon becomes the obsession of the master wax artist due to her striking similarity to one of his lost 'children.' It's then left up to Charlotte to prove the guilt of Igor and his accomplices before her friend receives the same artistic treatment as the missing corpses.- - - In the first of three official screen productions of this film (the following two being titled House of Wax), the prolific Hungarian director Michael Curtiz (Casablanca, Angels With Dirty Faces) delivers to us Mystery of the Wax Museum, a spectacular mystery-horror that is sadly often left overlooked among the classic horrors in favour of its 1953 remake.From technical standpoints, the film is magnificent. The direction of the endlessly talented Michael Curtiz, Ray Rennahan's cinematography, Anton Grot's art design, and L.E. Oates's wax statues make the film a truly beautiful sight. To add substance to the style, Don Mullaly and Carl Erickson's script works extremely well, especially the dialogue for Fay Wray (a true Scream Queen) and her wisecracking journalist character. There is a perfect blend of Gothic beauty and horror that is lightened (but not by too much) by the comedy of the journalist plot lines. There are some genuinely chilling and frightening scenes, like those that have become rarer and rarer as the decades passed. Lionel Atwill does a fantastic job as the creepy and tortured, mad genius, and Fay Wray's portrayal of the hilarious and flirtatious spitfire was perfect. Glenda Farrell was adequate, but outshined by her castmates.There were a couple flaws with the film, most notably the action-filled showdown at the conclusion that ruined the pace of the otherwise suspenseful film. Also, the fates seemed almost inadequate for a couple of the characters, but worked well enough. These bits weren't enough to harm the film much, but could've been improved upon to maintain the near-masterpiece of horror that had come before the ending.To sum up, Mystery of the Wax Museum is one of the most overlooked classic gems out there. . . probably due to the fact that it was lost for about fifty or so years due to a fire in the WB vaults. But, it's here now and ready to be viewid so it can receive the respect it's deserved over the past 75 years.Final Verdict: 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dementia Praewax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fast-paced, enjoyable thriller, directed by Michael Curtiz, anticipating the 1953 "House of Wax". That's the one with Phyllis Thaxter and Vincent Price. This one has the cast you'd associate with a 1933 production -- Fay Wray, Frank McHugh, Lionel Atill, Glenda Farrell as a snippy reporter, and others. The stories are similar. A deranged sculptor, unable to use his burned hands any longer, begins to kill people and kidnap their bodies, coating them in wax for his museum display. An inquisitive young lady discovers the truth. A girl is captured and stripped and bound under a spigot which will soon spout boiling wax. The cops interrupt the proceedings.Ordinarily, compared to their originals, remakes are odious. In this case, I don't know. Actually, both are pretty good.The chief difference is that this was shot in two-strip Technicolor, which gives the viewer not only black and white, but a choice of two designer colors -- albino pink and ghoul green. The photography in the 1953 version is not only more sophisticated and colorful but was 3-D when it was shot. (Watch out for that bouncing paddle ball!) The photography aside, this one has hammier acting, a slightly different plot, and was clearly written before the deranged minds of the censors tried to encase wholesomeness in a waxen shell. Everyone here seems to rush around throwing wisecracks at each other. "He's in the hoosegow." "How's your sex life?" "Everyone knew they were living together." A female figure in the wax museum is, as they used to say, undraped. In the 1953 version the police withhold a drink from an alcoholic until he breaks and spills the beans. Here, it's a "junkie".There are times when this one is pretty funny, which the later version never was. There's a scene in which Glenda Farrell, the reporter, tries to convince her boss, Frank McHugh, that something is wrong at the museum. Joan of Arc looks too much like a recently disappeared corpse. Farrell: "You ever hear of a death mask?" McHugh: "I sure have. I was married to one for years." Farrell: "I know. Then she came to life and divorced you." The slam-bang quality of the direction and the snappy script cut a bit into the terror of the story, which the later version preserves intact. There's nothing here as scary as the scene in 1953 in which the helpless Phyllis Kirk is being chased through the stylized, deserted New York streets by the hideously disfigured artist. Both are kind of enjoyable in their slightly different ways, though.I always wonder what happens when, not the wax, but the too too solid flesh under it should melt. You ever hear of "the lost wax method"?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A curiosity piece but what was the deal with the romance?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Mystery of the Wax Museum because I recently watched the House of Wax remake and so of course I had to go back and watch the original even though I didn't really like the remake, and Mystery happened to be a double feature with the original House of Wax. Having not seen the 1953 film yet, I'm impressed with the level of real tragedy that is infused into this film, which could very easily have just been a cheap exploitation horror film, like the 2005 version.For obvious reasons, the curiously named Ivan Igor, creator of the Wax Museum, reminds me very much of the Phantom of the Opera, film fans are sure to relish the clear influence of The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari on this film, and the rest of us will certainly get a kick out of watching the techniques of one of the earliest real horror films. Ivan Igor has been a struggling artist for some time, and just when it seems that his craft is about to take off into the public eye and make him famous, his partner, with whom he collaborated to rent the building in which he keeps his collection of wax figures, storms in and insists that he wants some insurance money back that he wasted on renting this place out, and before Igor can explain what happened only minutes before, he throws a match and the whole place explodes into flame, burning to the ground in minutes and hideously burning Igor. Injured to the point where he can no longer use his hands, but can only verbally direct other artists in how to do his work, Igor is never able to regain the level of quality that he was able to create himself, and thus ultimately he comes up with the idea to simply coat real corpses with wax and set them up as displays. And thus begins the premise that takes up relatively little of this film but which basically runs amok by the time the 2005 version was released. This one concentrates more on the struggles of a cute blonde reporter trying to get a good story and save her job than it does on the mystery of the wax museum, but once the two stories really start working together the movie flows really well. It's just too bad about the romance at the end of the film. What a joke. Nevertheless, still worth seeing, especially if you're interested in the House of Wax films or horror films in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original 'House Of Wax'. Lionel Atwill is terrific, but I still prefer Vincent Price and company.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'House Of Wax' is a great favourite of mine so I was very curious to see this, the original version. 'House Of Wax' sticks pretty close to 'Mystery Of The Wax Museum's template, with some scenes and lines being EXACTLY the same, but there a few differences that make it interesting. For one thing Lionel Atwill is a very different actor than Vincent Price. Price plays the character (different name, I know) as completely evil, Atwill makes him a bit more pathetic. The main difference between the two however is the Fay Wray character. Wray plays a typical 30s fast talking "new woman", a reporter, while Atwill's obsession is played by Glenda Farrell. In 'House Of Wax' there's no female reporter, just a male cop. Atwill and Wray actually made two other horror/thrillers together, including 'Doctor X' also for veteran director Michael Curtiz, who went on to make many classic Hollywood movies, not least of which 'Casablanca'. Wray hit the big time the same year as this with 'King Kong'. I love that movie but I've never been that much of a fan of her personally. But she's pretty good in this film, and Atwill is terrific. He's an actor rarely mentioned today, even though he appeared in many horror movies, most notably his unforgettable inspector in 'Son Of Frankenstein'. I enjoyed watching 'Mystery Of The Wax Museum', but it isn't a 30s horror classic like 'Dracula', 'Island Of Lost Souls' or 'Frankenstein', and to be honest, 'House Of Wax' is the better movie. But if you get the chance to see it, do so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did the powers that be at Warners lose their nerve while making this film? The splendidly grisly concept of corpses covered in wax to simulate statues is so frequently by-passed for the stock-in-trade banter of Glenda Farrell and Frank McHugh, one must truly wonder about the creative decisions that were made.When the action focuses on the splendidly crazed Lionel Atwill and his pursuit of Fay Wray - who else? - the film jolts back to life. The decor by Anton Grot is first rate, the early color adds a frission and tension that is praiseworthy. But these do not completely overcome the deficiencies of the script and the scenery chewing of Farrell and McHugh. Isolated scenes stand out - the fire in the wax museum, the corpse sitting up in the morgue, the monster's silent, straightforward entrances, and the final confrontation between Atwill and Wray. But these enliven a film that too often lapses into the ordinary.Worthwhile for its stronger elements, and generally gutsier than the 1953 remake. But it should have been better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great idea that lacked in execution</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen the Vincent Price remake HOUSE OF WAX several times and consider it one of my favorite classic horror movies, but I just got to see this original for the first time. I really tried, as a viewer, to be fair to this movie and review it on its' own merits as the original rather than making any comparisons to the de Toth version. However, in put into its' own context, this movie doesn't really come close to the level of the best 30s horror movies.The idea for the story itself, taken from an unpublished short story is excellent and, in the end, is what carries this movie. It seems a little cliché to a modern audience, but the idea certainly originate here. A genius sculptor is content to create works of art, rather than play up the grand guignol for the masses. This puts the museum in financial trouble and his partner's solution is to torch it for the insurance money. Having lost everything important to him, our master artist (played by Lionel Atwill), descends into lunacy and starts casting corpses in wax to rebuild his attraction. The idea of so sinister and clever and just rings of the sort of story popular in the horror pulps of the time.Lionel Atwill is very good as the deranged artist. He's been a role player in probably a dozen period horror movies that I've seen, but tends to play the scientist or police inspector. It's nice getting to see him play the villain here and shows me he should have been given that opportunity more often. His makeup is also excellent when he see his "true face". A withered, burnt up visage that mirrors the twisting of his soul, its' one of the better makeups I've seen in old horror, outside the legendary Jack Pierce's work.The problems with the movie start with the bad script. Like the title implies, this plays much more as a detective mystery than straight horror. The fright scenes are few and far between, spending more time focusing on the whodunit aspect led by a news reporter. This may have been able to work had the plot not meandered all over the place, bringing in unnecessary characters and plot points that only bog things down and slow the pace. The worst aspect of this is our main character, a newspaper gal played by Glenda Farrell. She eats up far too much of the run time playing an annoying character who talks to fast and makes witty quips with her editor that may have been funny at the time, but are not now. Had the writers chosen to spend more time with Atwill and less on our heroine, things might have turned out much differently.The other thing worth mentioning is the two-color technicolor. I have read a bit about this coloring in this movie and it would seem that the version you watch makes a huge difference. Apparently, the stream I saw was from the DVD release, which is not very true to the original coloring and looks very bland and washed out. I'm not, personally, sure where to see the more pastel technicolor that it's supposed to be seen in.Too many times I found myself struggling to keep my attention going, mostly when our intrepid reporter is eating up scene time. The beginning and ending are quite worthwhile, but this is not quite at the level of Universal's work in the same time period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mystery of the Wax Museum" is a really decent film for the time but hasn't aged well.**SPOILERS**On New Years in New York, a series of thefts from morgues has the police baffled. Reporter Florence Dempsey, (Glenda Farrell) is assigned to the case and soon becomes hooked on proving the suspect innocent. When visiting her friends Charlotte Duncan, (Fay Wray) and her boyfriend Ralph Burton, (Allen Vincent) at a wax museum opening for Ivan Igor, (Lionel Atwill) he is taken by her and asks to have her pose for a future sculpture. When it officially opens, she goes after a story about what she suspects is behind the wax museum, and soon discovers that she was right and that a horrible secret lies there.The Good News: This one here is a pretty decent film overall. The biggest factor here is that there's a rather impressive set of work done on the Wax Museums. They both look incredible, as the realistic-looking sculptures look so much more believable due to the positioning and dioramas positioned together. That gives them a rather great look and makes them all the better. The other really great feature that impresses is the large wax station at the end, which is a really beautiful set that looks overall really huge and impressive. Aside from the sets, the one really impressive thing about the film is it's great opening, as this one has one of the greatest, most action-packed openings around. From the rumblings of the insurance, it soon gets the idea going that something big will happen, and this one delivers better than expected. There's a spectacular fire that is full of spectacle, which gets completely over-the-top later on when watching the wax gorily drip away in the blaze which is really fun. There's even a rather great brawl amidst the flaming structures that also works nicely. This scene is what really makes this movie work, and is one of the best feature-length scenes in the genre. It almost makes up for the film's several flaws.The Bad News: This one doesn't have a whole lot wrong, but they are severe enough to lower it. The most predominant one is that there's way too much time on the lame investigator angle. This one is really badly done that it's done with a really annoying manner which gets really tiring. This one decides to have her find a lead in the story and upon looking into it, they find a way to make it look bad for her, then finds another one and is allowed to pursue it. This happens repeatedly in the film and after so many times, it finally gets to the point where it's too ridiculous to be believable. That is a really badly-done situation that doesn't seem ridiculous at all. The second flaw is that it squanders one of the best possible scares in the film, the destruction of the wax mas to reveal the scarred face beneath. Seeing this should've been the greatest shock in the film, since it's set-up to come as a total surprise when it occurs. Here, though, there's several shots of the face long before the mask breaks, and it does leave a really huge missed opportunity quite apparent. These here really ruin the film's momentum.The Final Verdict: While this one isn't terrible, it's still a pretty lowered film and does have a few major problems with it. If approached in the spirit of fun, this can be entertaining and is mostly recommended to those who enjoy the films of this time, while those who don't really find this interesting should either heed caution or see the remake.Today's Rating-PG: Violence</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is seldom seen on TV, though its 1950s remake starring Vincent Price is relatively common to find. I think this is actually not that bad a thing, as this original version is a greatly inferior movie. This is because although the plot is spine-tingling and exciting, there are so many bad performances and the writing for the characters is definitely B-movie quality at best. Plus, although the movie is supposed to be scary, at times the goofiness of some of the characters derails the film and reduces its effectiveness. Plus, Fay Wray just wasn't that good as the lady in distress. The bottom line is that it's pretty good but very uneven. Instead of watching it, I STRONGLY recommend the remake--Vincent Price is at his absolute best and the film is genuinely terrifying. This 1933 version is anything but scary.My advice is if you can, see BOTH. But, if you can only see one, see the Price version.</fullReview>

Like i said it is, for the most part, a shot-for-shot remake, so his performance is really the only main difference. The Story is fairly standard. A mans life work is destroyed, so he (because this makes sense) kills a bunch of people to remake his museum. I say go see it, but look for "House of Wax" first.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mystery of the Wax Museum is perhaps best known for the 1953 remake by Andre de Toth, House of Wax, but while the two have much in common, there is one big difference: House of Wax works, and Mystery doesn't. The story involves a wax sculpture artist named Ivan Igor (Lionel Atwill, who went on to be typecast for his entire career) who builds a wax museum out of real corpses -- and while his reasoning behind this decision is explained in House of Wax, there appears to be no particular reason in this film. Meanwhile, a precocious news reporter (Glenda Farrell) gets hot on his trail as he becomes obsessed with her beautiful roommate (Fay Wray). Actually, the plot alone is filled with so many holes that I don't think I'll bother to explain anything else. The performances in Mystery are quite appalling: Farrell epitomizes the atypically impetuous actress from the thirties, but she's completely bereft of any charm. And while Wray isn't exactly dreadful, the role she's stuck in essentially amounts to having to scream for the duration of the movie. If there's a single noteworthy performance in the picture, it belongs to Atwill, who seems entirely too devoted to his part. The script by Don Mullaly and Carl Erickson (adapted from a play by Charles Belden) is just bad. One of the reasons House of Wax succeeded was because it didn't take itself too seriously -- instead, it embraced its kitschiness: in Mystery, Mullaly and Erickson appear to treat every poorly-written word as if it's Shakespeare. However, now that I have the angry part of my critique out of the way, allow me to say that this movie isn't a TOTAL failure; there are some diamonds in the rough that would go on to flourish in de Toth's superior remake. Firstly, the makeup and costumes are very impressive for the time period we're looking at, and some of the set pieces are simply marvelous. The film was the last of a batch that was shot in an experimental two-color Technicolor stock, and the effect -- while not really successful -- is rather intriguing. Mystery of the Wax Museum was directed by Michael Curtiz, who went on to craft such masterpieces as Casablanca, Yankee Doodle Dandy, and Mildred Pierce: he exhibits a number of signs of potential in this early feature, but that doesn't change the fact that the movie itself is a flop. There are some clever cuts and innovative uses of shadows that belie the film's poor quality, but beneath it all it's still a failed experiment. Then again, it's of those movies that fails so horribly it's almost kind of good -- in an incoherent, unintelligible way. Fans of Curtiz and of the genre itself might have a semi-interesting viewing experience, but anyone who's just looking for a good time should skip this and check out de Toth's version.Grade: C-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The remake is better!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lionel Atwill once again stars in what was suppose to be a creepy early 30s thriller like "Doctor X" he made a year before. Michael Curtiz once again directs, Fay Wray co-stars again, and Warners released this, too. If you see the Vincent Price remake "House of Wax" first, you will be extremely disappointed with this. This is not as bad as "Doctor X," but its just so antiquated in some respect. Once again, the use of two-color Technicolor and the rich settings gives some flavor, but like "House of Wax" is more melodramatic than horror, but even more so. Deserves 2 1/2 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a classic but pretty close</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Basically the original version of "House of Wax" with Lionel Atwill as the madman and Fay Wray as his beautiful victim. This was considered a lost film for about 25 years. Everybody kept saying it was better than its remake. A copy was found in Jack Warner's vault and restored in the late 1970s. Naturally it didn't live up to its reputation.Good cast, eerie atmosphere, interesting 2 color Technicolor (unfortunately, more often than not, it makes scenes look "washed out"), and with a good script. Not many movies from that era dealt openly with drug addiction! However, as everybody has already noted, the "comic" relief doesn't work. Glenda Farrell plays a loud, onboxious reporter constantly cracking jokes. Unfortunately the jokes are stupid, obvious and just not funny! Even worse she's in the movie quite a bit. She was also a lousy actress. Still, if you can overlook that (it's hard but it can be done), the movie really works. The creepy atmosphere gets to you and Atwill is just great in his role. Also the classic face cracking is done much better here than in the boring remake. And of course Fay Wray gets to belt out a few loud screams! So it's not as good as you might hope but still well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painfully Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the version that I watched on DVD, it seemed that it had been edited by a drunken chimp with no fingers. When people start teleporting across the room, you know that it is all down hill from there. The dialogue was cheesy and very confusing, but maybe that is because I don't speak bad thirties New York slang...."old timer?"</fullReview>
