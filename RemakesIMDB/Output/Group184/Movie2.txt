		<shortDescription>Classic Fun-Filled Horror!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House of Wax was one of the few films made in 3D which was a huge success. This may have more to do with the fact that it had a good, strong story and great acting and did not rely solely upon it's 3D special effects.The late great Vincent Price is Henry Jarrod, a sweet and dedicated artist who creates lifelike mannequins for a wax museum. His statues - depicting everyone from Marie Antoinette &amp; Joan of Arc to John Wilkes Booth - are loved by Henry as much as if they were his own children. When he objects to creating more horrific sculptures to attract more paying customers, his partner sets the museum on fire, hoping to collect a tidy sum in insurance money. Henry supposedly perishes in the flames, trying in vain to rescue his beloved wax friends in a scene which is truly heartbreaking. Some time later, Henry reappears, wheelchair bound and just a tad bitter. He has opened a new wax museum which features realistic scenes of murder and horror, many of them taken from current headlines. Unfortunately, some of them are just a little TOO realistic: one looks like Henry's ex-partner, who was found hanging in an elevator shaft. Was it really a suicide, or something more sinister? Joan of Arc bears a striking resemblance to Cathy Gray, a young girl who has gone missing from her room. And Cathy's friend Sue looks exactly like the lost Marie Antoinette, the pride and joy of Henry's former exhibit. Soon, a horribly scarred monster is chasing Sue through the foggy night time streets. Can the police, and Sue's artistic young suitor, solve the mystery in time? Or will Sue wind up as yet another display in the House of Wax?This is a wonderful, creepy scare-fest with great sets, beautiful colors and strong performances. Vincent Price as Henry Jarrod is both lovable and horrifying as the kind man driven mad. Charles Bronson, in a very early role, is super freaky as Henry's mute and morbid assistant. Carolyn Jones (in her pre-Morticia Addams days) is blond, pretty Cathy, the squeaky opportunist with the heart of gold. Phyllis Kirk is the sensible Sue, a slightly uptight but genuinely believable victim. The scene where she must run through the deserted, fog-soaked streets is very, convincingly creepy. When Sue actually stops long enough to remove her noisy and cumbersome high heeled shoes, which give away her every step on the cobblestone road, I very nearly applauded. The 3D effects are an added bonus to an already wonderfully fun movie - watch for the classic paddle ball scene!This is one of Price's best starring role films. It is everything that a good horror film should be - funny without being ridiculous, scary without the gore and fantastical without being far fetched. 10 stars!!! Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suffering for beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Professor" Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is a sculptor who works in wax. He's living in New York City in the late 19th Century, and he's displaying his handiwork in a wax museum. When his partner, Matthew Burke (Roy Robert)--really his primary investor--balks at Jarrod's receipts and tries to talk him into moving in a more commercial direction, perhaps with a "Chamber of Horrors", Jarrod protests that he's creating meticulous works of art, not cheap sensationalism. Jarrod tries to interest a new investor, but when the prospect says he can't make a decision for a few months, Burke says he can't wait. He suggests torching the place and collecting the insurance money. When Jarrod refuses, Burke torches the museum anyway, and the two fight. Jarrod supposedly dies in the fire, leaving Burke to collect. However, when a mysterious, disfigured stranger shows up, the resolution may not be so simple.The debate that Jarrod and Burke have in the opening scene of this remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) is particularly ironic in light of the film's history. House of Wax was made as a 3D film--a fact made more than obvious from the film's opening credits, which are presented in a font made to look like it is bursting forth from the screen.In the early 1950s, movie theater box office receipts were down because of television. Film studios and movie theaters were looking for gimmicks that would make films seem more special. They were looking to do things that television couldn't do. According to film editor Rudi Fehr, "The House of Wax was made because the theaters were empty, people were staying home to watch television. In order to lure the audiences back to the theaters, Warner's came out with 3D." While this wasn't the first commercial 3D film--1952's Bwana Devil holds that honor, this was certainly one of the more popular ones.Studio head Jack Warner told Fehr that he would have five weeks to edit the film after shooting was done. Fehr said they could get it done even quicker if director Andre De Toth would shoot the film in sequence. So Warner demanded just that, despite De Toth's protests. Shooting in sequence is unusual and can make the on-set crew's job much more difficult. But it certainly didn't negatively affect the performances or De Toth's direction, which are both outstanding despite a couple strangely truncated bits of exposition.Like many 3D films, there are a few shots in House of Wax that might otherwise be inexplicable. The most prominent example here is a huckster who stands in front of the revamped House of Wax doing tricks with three paddleballs. We linger on him much longer than we normally would so that he can bounce the ball into our face. This shows part of the difficulty of 3D--it's difficult to reconcile the most impressive effects from the audience's perspective with narrative needs. Viewed now, in simple 2D on a television screen, the obligatory 3D shots of House of Wax play as quirky, campy curios. For me, that adds to the charm of the film.Price has an unusual role here in that he plays a good portion of the film with disfigurement makeup, half-limping, hunched over, covered in bulky black cloaks in a manner that somewhat prefigures John Hurt's turn as John Merrick in The Elephant Man (1980). De Toth is excellent at building atmosphere, especially in the "external" shots, which frequently feel more like we're watching a version of the Jack the Ripper story set in London.Most of the script by Crane Wilbur, based on a play by Charles Belden (which also served as the basis for 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum, of course), is deliciously flagitious--degenerate in a more over the top manner than was usual for the period. The conflagration at the end of the opening is particularly unexpected and twisted, as is Jarrod's modus operandi throughout the film. It's only too bad that the self-enforced Hollywood "moral code" at the time could not have allowed for a more nihilistic ending. I for one was cheering on Jarrod and his assistant Igor, played by none other than Charles Bronson in one of his earlier roles, when he was still using "Charles Buchinsky".Although it's difficult to say whether Belden, Wilbur or De Toth intended a message or subtext, it's easy to read a number of interesting angles into the film. To begin, the use of the name "Igor" for the assistant suggests a number of twisted turnabouts on Dr. Frankenstein. Jarrod is even more depraved than the good doctor as he "creates death" out of life, in the service of art. At least it seems depraved if you're not an artist. If you are, you might simply note that one must suffer to be beautiful. That's more than just a flippant remark, as Jarrod suffers financially for beauty early in the film, and Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones) suffers physically for beauty as she nearly suffocates herself to make herself thin. And of course there's the literal, sinister sense in which the artist makes others suffer to create his beauty. There are also very interesting subtexts available related to goals of realism in art, and of course, the ironic messages noted earlier in the beginning of the film, where we are debating aesthetics versus financial, or more material considerations.Although House of Wax was popular at the box office in 1953, there was no shortage of critical devaluations of the film as a cheap gimmick, and no shortage of complaints about image quality and eyestrain when trying to view the film in 3D. 3D was only prominent for another year or so (to make periodic returns later, often for "number 3" films in series), but House of Wax is a much better film than it was given credit for at the time. It's not Vincent Price's best, but it's well worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The House of Wax is a true horror classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The House of Wax is a true horror classic! I saw it for the first time in 1953 at a local theatre in 3-D.I have seen it many times since on video. It never ceases to entertain.While watching it today I noticed something for the very first time: a most interesting anachronism.This film takes place in old New York circa 1900. Every indoor scene has a gaslight in it, and the fire department responds with a horse-drawn wagon. Well, in one of the early scenes in the film Prof. Jarrod(Vincent Price)is conducting a prospective investor, Sidney Wallace(Paul Cavanagh), on a tour of his wax museum. There are gas lights everywhere. They arrive at an exhibit and Prof. Jarrod flips a wall switch, and presto the exhibit is illuminated in light. Somebody goofed!If you've never seen The House of Wax, watch it. You'll love it.One more interesting note. Dabbs Greer who plays Sergeant Jim Shane in this film also plays old Paul Edgecomb in the 1999 thriller The Green Mile.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When horror films were fun for everybody!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOUSE OF WAX established Vincent Price as a horror film icon. He's never hammy here. He's best when describing gruesome details (like torture or murder) with a slight grin, as if he's building to a punchline. Crane Wilbur's screenplay has well researched details (regarding how wax sculpting works, the effects of chemical burns for example) improves on the 1933 original. Here Vincent Price plays Henry Jerrod, a wax sculptor whose first try at a wax museum meets the same infernal end as Atwill's museum in the first film. 12 years later, Jerrod opens a new museum. One of his intern sculptors dates a model, Sue (Phyllis Kirk) who is hounded by a mysterious man with a distorted face. In the original film version, made in 1933, Fay Wray plays a beautiful, but uninteresting damsel in distress. Phyllis Kirk fills Fay Wray's part here, and man, is she even more boring! But don't worry, you have plenty of Vincent to make this DVD worthwhile. It's easy to find in a bit part, young Charles Bronson (billed here as Charles Buchinsky) as one of Jerrod's s interns. HOUSE OF WAX's most famous element is that it was made in 3-D. This new gimmick, meant to lure television viewers back to the box office was novel, but it had it's kinks. (Warner Brothers improved the process a year later with the 3-D release of Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER, and yet another period horror film, PHANTOM OF THE RUE MORGUE.) The most amusing 3-D moment in HOUSE OF WAX has almost nothing to do with the story. A carnival barker, (played with crowd-pleasing energy by Reggie Rymal) constantly whacks a paddle-ball outside the wax museum, while heralding the museum's opening night thrills. He faces the camera (meaning us) and says `You! With the popcorn. Hold still.' and he proceeds to repeatingly whack the ball at the camera. HOUSE OF WAX is a lot of fun, and was a big hit at the time. The DVD does not come with a 3-D Process, but it does come with coverage of HOUSE OF WAX's Hollywood Premier. It's attended by Bela Lugosi and friend, Jack Warner, and Ronald Reagan (See, even Presidents watch horror movies!)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is this movie as much fun in 2D?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Perhaps I've been lucky. I've only seen this film twice in the past 15 years, but both times were in 3D, the second time last night. The crowd just loved it, with a big round of applause at the end.The paddle ball scene is a highlight, but the reprise of the paddle ball is even more hilarious. It's completely over the top, and helps to create the carnival atmosphere that makes the film so effective in a large group.The really dramatic 3D effects in this film are played for laughs, and I think that's one of the keys to its overall success. Director André De Toth treats the gimmick as a gimmick, and doesn't try to get more out of it than that. Hitchcock, in "Dial M For Murder", tried to use the technology for dramatic effect, but that was a complete failure. The gimmick gets in the way of real drama. The attempted murder of Grace Kelly in "Dial M" is more shocking in 2D. In 3D, you're completely jolted out of your involvement in the scene when Grace's grasping hand comes lunging halfway out into the audience at you.In "House of Wax", the effect found its real home, a melodramatic thriller, played by everyone with tongue firmly in cheek.De Toth composes his shots really nicely, I think. There's some foregrounding of chandeliers and other props, but never too much. He mostly holds back on the effect until he can make the best use of it -- the paddle ball, the can-can dancer's round bottom, the bust of Charles Bronson at the end. There is one great 3D thrill, the shot where Bronson, playing Vincent Price's evil mute assistant, has to grapple with policeman Frank Lovejoy. Bronson appears to leap out of the audience and onto the screen; it's an unexpected moment, and a real treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A horror classic, which every fan of the genre should see. Vincent Price's horror persona begins here!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Vincent Price, my all time favourite horror actor. 'House Of Wax' is an important movie in his career, because it was his first legitimate horror film, after thirty something pictures in a variety of genres. This really is where the Price persona fans know and love began. He made non-horror pictures after this, it was a few years later that he made 'The Fly' and the William Castle movies which made him a horror star, something cemented later in the 60s with Roger Corman's Poe movies. But you can see Vincent Price horror icon right here. He's terrific as Jarrod and he would draw upon this role for 'The Mad Magician', and later, the Phibes movies and 'Theatre Of Blood'. 'House Of Wax' is a remake of 'Mystery Of The Wax Museum' made twenty years earlier. In that one Lionel Atwill played the Price role (different name, but same character). Atwill was great but Price is even better, as is the movie overall. 'House Of Wax' sticks pretty much to the earlier movie, but with a few changes, most notably the absence of the girl reporter character that Fay Wray played in the original. In this, the policeman played by Frank Lovejoy ('In A Lonely Place') takes on a similar role. Phyllis Kirk is good as the female lead, better in my opinion than Glenda Farrell in the earlier picture. The supporting cast also includes Carolyn "Morticia Addams" Jones, and an early appearance by Charles Bronson, who plays a deaf mute named Igor. 'House Of Wax' was made specifically for 3D, so there's a few gimmicky shots, but that doesn't spoil the movie, which to me is a horror classic that every fan of the genre should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest 3-D film of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House of Wax is a decent film without the three-dimensional effects, but it is a complete riot when viewed in the original 3-D, especially when we get to see the emcee in front of the theater. Vincent Price is at his creepy best in this film about a man who opens up a wax museum that has a secret as to why the figures look so life-like. This was the second time I had seen it in its original format, and I enjoyed it just as much this time, including its over the top melodrama and unbelievably dated dialogue. Do not miss this film if you can find it showing at a classic movie house, because it is extremely entertaining to experience. --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most important films of the 1950s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly a shocker and a spectacle, 'House of Wax' is one of the great films about films. It works brilliantly as a horror, one of the few films to reek of dread and death; some of the grisly images (Jarrod's partner hanging down an elevator shaft, later exhibited in the museum) are inspired; the suspense sequences combine eerie visual beauty with fundamental sexual fears (the film's treatment of independent women in a patriarchal world is very astute in the housewife 50s). Vincent Price's performance as a man who can only feel alive with the dead is very moving.But 'Wax''s self-reflexivity is unprecedented in Hollywood films since the silents. It is a film using a novel spectacle (3-D) to encourage greater realism, concentrating on gruesome sensation. The film is about a museum, also called House of Wax, also a novel spectacle, also more realistic, and also gruesomely sensationalist. The film's artifice is always prominent, most violently with the ping-pong man, bridging the gap between film and audience by assailing us. What we are doing - watching a House of Wax - is what the characters are doing. And we know what happens to THEM...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Morgue of Wax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1900, in New York, Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is an artist, sculpting masterpieces in wax and exposing them in a small and non-profitable museum. When his partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts) proposes a criminal fire to receive the insurance, Henry does not accept and fights with him. Henry is knocked out, left in the burning place and considered dead by the insurance company. When Matthew receives the insurance money, a disfigured man kills him, and later many corpses vanish from the city morgue. The crippled Prof. Henry Jarrod reappears in a wheelchair and destroyed hands, preparing the grand-opening of his wax museum. Meanwhile, Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) is impressed with the resemblance of statue of Joan of Arc with her friend Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones), who was killed and her corpse was missing, and she suspects that her body was covered by wax."House of Wax" is good, but also an absolutely unnecessary remake of Michael Curtiz's "Mystery of the Wax Museum", which is better resolved. There are many scenes and dialogs that are identical, and this remake does not add any value to the original movie. Vincent Price performs a creepy character and the movement of his body is one of the greatest differences in this remake. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "Museu de Cera" ("Wax Museum")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's first major 3-D feature is a knock-out - but ONLY in 3-D...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOUSE OF WAX Aspect ratio: 1.37:1 (Natural Vision 3-Dimension)Sound format: WarnerPhonic SoundThough BWANA DEVIL (1952) was clearly responsible for kickstarting the 3-D boom of the 1950's, it's doubtful the fad would have survived for long had it not been for Andre de Toth's HOUSE OF WAX, ballyhooed by Warner Bros. as: "The BIG 3-D feature you've been waiting for!" The studio's confidence is borne out by the film itself, a sensational - and sensationalized - remake of Michael Curtiz's MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM (1933), in which sculptor and wax museum curator Vincent Price is driven insane after being disfigured in a fire set by his greedy business partner (Roy Roberts), eager to reap the benefits of a generous insurance policy. Using a wax mask to conceal his true appearance, Price makes short work of Roberts and reopens his museum in New York, where he steals fresh cadavers and uses them as the human framework for his gruesome exhibits, only to be rumbled by heroine Phyllis Kirk when her recently-murdered friend (Carolyn Jones) turns up as part of the Joan of Arc exhibit...With its handsome period art direction - the movie is set in 1902 - and no-nonsense screenplay, this was clearly designed as one of Warner's major attractions for 1953, above and beyond the film's technical achievements. Today, the storyline may seem a little predictable, even for those unfamiliar with Curtiz's original, but the narrative unfolds at a rapid clip and contains more than a few hair-raising set-pieces, most notably the opening fire sequence (in which Price looms uncomfortably close to the raging inferno); the discovery of Roberts' corpse in an elevator shaft; Price's cloaked villain stealing a corpse from the morgue at midnight and pursuing Kirk through the fog-shrouded streets; and the climactic face-off around a vat of boiling wax. There's even a chorus of dancing girls (watch out for those legs!), along with a couple of ferocious fight scenes which - literally! - erupt from the screen! Price achieved lasting fame as a consequence of the film's box office success - he was quickly snared by Columbia for their own 3-D horror feature, THE MAD MAGICIAN (1954), sealing his fate as one of Hollywood's premier boogeymen - but except for the scenes in which he appears as a malformed ghoul, his performance is too restrained to be entirely effective, and the same could be said of virtually all the principal players. Only Jones (later TV's Morticia Addams) as Kirk's giggling, gold-digging best friend and Paul Cavanagh (THE FOUR SKULLS OF JONATHAN DRAKE) as the unwitting patron of Price's latest venture make much of an impression, while Frank Lovejoy and Dabbs Greer are the hard-working cops whose suspicions lead to the villain's downfall. However, while the characters may be bland and unremarkable, the film succeeds by virtue of its spectacle, and recent festival screenings (to celebrate 50 years since the first 3-D boom) have been sold out on every occasion, reaffirming its enduring appeal as one of the finest movies of its kind.Reviewers often claim the film is 'just as good' when screened flat, and while there's no denying the production's many virtues, the 3-D version is a REVELATION! Using the dual-camera Natural Vision format developed by Milton and Julian Gunzberg (first used in BWANA DEVIL the year before), cinematographers Bert Glennon and J. Peverell Marley use the process to emphasize depth in every sequence, framing each shot to highlight the angles in Stanley Fleischer's careful set designs. For commercial reasons, de Toth includes a number of crowd-pleasing off-the-screen effects (Reggie Rymal's infamous paddle-ball is the most fondly-remembered), though the film doesn't overplay it's hand in this respect. Contemporary audiences were startled out of their seats during a climactic sequence in which Bronson looms out of the FOREGROUND to attack hero Paul Picerni, one of several passages created specifically with 3-D in mind, and which are rendered completely ineffective and/or pointless in flat versions. Viewing the film minus its dimensional effects is like watching a pan-scan edition of a widescreen movie, in which half the entertainment value has been cruelly revoked.Warner Bros. also used "House" to inaugurate their short-lived WarnerPhonic Sound system, which added an even greater dimension to proceedings. Multichannel sound wasn't a new concept at the time (Disney had used the Fantasound process as early as 1940 for FANTASIA, for instance), but it WAS decidedly rare in mass market features (THIS IS CINERAMA introduced a 7-track process in 1952, but Cinerama was a non-starter for regular movie houses). And while most theaters played the movie in standard optical mono, lucky patrons who attended engagements in major metropolitan areas enjoyed "The first phenomenal merger of 3-D action! 3-D color! and 3-D sound!", as per the ads. Sadly, the WarnerPhonic tracks have since been lost, and current multichannel versions feature a remix of the mono elements by Chace Stereo, no more than a fair approximation of the original material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still Scary After All These Years!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every element works: from script to art direction to cinematography to direction and acting.But let's face it: it's Gordon Bau's horrific makeup for the disfigured Vincent Price that still, today, over 50 years later, is every bit as frightening as Dick Baker's makeup for Linda Blair in "The Exorcist." Crane Wilbur's script and Andre De Toth's direction, enacted in Stanley Fleischer's brilliantly designed sets and shot and lit by two of the best (Bert Glennon and Peverell Marley) still provide a thrill-ride of tension and shocks -- with or without 3-D.The early set piece of the fire in Vincent Price's studio operates on several levels to motivate everything that follows. As designed and filmed, it begins with greed and violence and destruction between two human beings (Price and his benefactor, Roy Roberts), then proceeds to a vicious assault by fire on Price's "art" -- his magnificent wax sculptures of historic figures.The flames leap from one sculpture to another, melting them in shots that are haunting and disturbing simultaneously -- almost as if we're watching not-quite-human beings burned alive. We're scared, sad, unsettled and tense at cinematic visuals no audience had seen before. (Of course, this sequence foreshadows Price's OWN disfigurement and motivates his revenge). An explosion climaxes this sequence.From then on, HOW moves from brilliant set piece to brilliant set piece, as Price stalks his victims.And Price is magnificent -- particularly as his "disfigured" self. He's a human who's been "made" a "monster" by another human's terrible betrayal. It's extremely difficult to act under heavy horror makeup: to convey real emotions, particularly sympathetic ones, with only one's eyes and body language requires more expertise than horror actors are generally given (witness Boris Karloff's incredible performance as the Monster in "Frankenstein" under similarly restrictive makeup).Price's silent, slouching, lame foot-dragging body movements (enhanced by Howard Shoup's cape and hat costume) almost gave him the feeling of a wounded bird of prey or insect. Whether his movements were developed by him alone, or in conjunction with director De Toth, is impossible to say. What IS possible to say is that no "monster" had ever moved quite this way on screen before. And his makeup, back in the day, was genuinely shocking. It still is.It's astonishing, the range of emotions Price was able to express and evoke under all that camouflage.Even on repeated viewings (even in 2-D), it's remarkable how much tension HOW generates. And once Phyllis Kirk breaks Price's waxen mask to reveal the hideous burns and scars beneath -- the tension is non-stop.As other comments have noted, it is perhaps the subtextual layers that make HOW a timeless classic. Art versus Greed, sensitivity versus violence, beauty versus deformity, love versus hate, altruism versus revenge, Life versus Death.For all its action and horror, HOW is also a philosophically dense conflict that operates on almost subliminal intellectual and emotional levels -- whether intended or not. (It's hard to see how these were NOT intended, since the story and script are so flawlessly constructed.) HOW was a landmark film when it was made (and certainly a landmark film for Vincent Price). It's still an effective classic today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House Of Wax was the movie that made Vincent Price an established horror star and this has to be one of his best.Henry Jarrod's wax museum is set on fire deliberately by one of his friends for the insurance money and is killed in this. Jarrod is presumed dead, but he isn't and he reopens the museum under a new name, House of Wax. He has used real bodies for the exhibits, murdering his victims at night, without his mask as his face was badly scarred in the fire. One woman reminds him of his top exhibit which got destroyed in the fire and he wants her in his collection. He captures her but she is rescued by her lover at the end and Gerrard is put in the cauldron of wax and killed.House of Wax has a haunting music score and is atmospheric throughout.Joining Price in the cast are Frank Lovejoy, Phyllis Kirk, Carolyn Jones and an early role for Charles Bronson as Price's mute assistant Igor.House of Wax is a must see for horror fans. Fantastic.Rating: 4 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Long awaited DVD is fantastic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being the film that catapulted Vincent Price into the horror hall offame, House of Wax was one film that needed to see the light ofday on DVD. The wait was worth it! As a bonus, WB threw in theoriginal Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933) with Lionel Atwill (Sonof Frankenstein) and Fay Wray (King Kong) directed by none otherthan Michael Curtiz (Casablanca). A very early 2-color film thatholds up well today, MOTWM is definitely a must see for fans ofHouse of Wax. A second bonus feature, while only two minuteslong, is an unbelievable film shot at its premiere. Among othernoteworthy guests caught on film, Bela Lugosi is captured walkingup the red carpet in his Dracula cape sporting a man chained in a gorilla suit! The picture quality of House of Wax is dynamite! Rich textures andcolors have been brought out by the transfer that make it appearas if it were shot yesterday. The crystal clear transfer sets the barfor other horror classics yet to see a DVD release. This disc ismost certainly a must for any Vincent Price fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great in 3D--kind of dull in 2D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Horror film about a mad wax sculptor (Vincent Price) who uses corpses for his exhibits. He sees a lovely woman (Phyllis Kirk) and wants to make her his next victim.One of the most famous 3-D films ever made and (I believe) the most successful. I've been lucky enough to see this twice in a theatre in 3D. The effects were astounding (especially the paddle ball) and it was a lot of fun. It was easy to ignore the plot loopholes and bad acting. On TV in 2-D, the effects are lost and you're left with the dull story and lousy acting (Kirk was the worst offender). Even Price gives a bad performance! It can't hold a candle to the original "Mystery of the Wax Museum" which came out in 1932. Still, even in 2D, it has its moments--Kirk being stalked by Price in the fog, the eerie wax museum, the burning of the wax figures, and what happens when Kirk tries to beat off Price at the end. Also it's fun to see Charles Brosnan in an early role (as Igor) and there's a remark about Provincetown Massachusetts which will get a good laugh out of people who know of it. But, basically, it's a bore in 2-D. Only worth seeing in 3-D.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is the heyday of wonder and it is no surprise it's roots are in Paris. In the dark lonely alleys, amid the wet streets of the heart of the city, a dark cloaked figure follows a beautiful woman. To say she is beautiful is to understate her natural qualities, but to further add that such beauty has attracted the most sinister and diabolical madman in Paris is also understating the danger or his intent. Such is background of the incredible black story entitle; "The House of Wax." Vincent Price, plays Prof. Henry Jarrod an artistic genius who boosts his collection of famous, historical wax-works, are the most unique in all the world. It is no idle boost, as his house contains more than just legendary wax figures from the pages of history, they also contain enough secrets that police Lt. Tom Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) finds more than interesting. Together with Sgt. Jim Shane (Dabbs Greer) there is more sinister mystery in the museum than either suspect. Price plays his role to the hilt as does his dutiful side kick " Igor" (Charles Bronsen) which audience will instantly recognize. Together they terrify audience while preparing their evil craft. On completion, they seek their prize, the beloved French beauty, Marie Antoinette, who is to be their crowning achievement. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still one of the most haunting pictures of our time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the remake recently of House of Wax and mainly that was because I just wanted to see Paris Hilton die once and for all! I was a satisfied customer, but the movie actually turned out to be pretty good, so I was very curious to see the original, especially since I love Vincent Price. Who wouldn't love him? He's the king of B-Horror Movies. He has brought us House of Wax, the original haunting tale of an artist who went too far to create his works of art.Henry Jarrod is an artist who has devoted his life to his wax museum, but when his partner is upset with the investment and wishing it had better success, he offers to burn the place down and split the insurance money with Henry. But Henry refuses, his partner goes through with it by burning the place down and knocking Henry unconscious and leaving him for dead. But a little while later, his partner convinces the insurance company that Henry is dead and collects the insurance money, but things start to happen like the partner dies but it looks like suicide and Cathy's, our leading lady, best friend is murdered by a horribly disfigured man and her best friend's body disappears only to happen to look like a figure of Henry's new exhibit.House of Wax maybe be tame by today's standards, but just think of the time, no one ever thought in a million years of something this horrific. A sick artist taking our corpses or killing us just because we would inspire him, it's a scary thought. Vincent Price added so much horror and beauty to this picture that will never be forgotten once you have seen it.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>House of Wax (1953)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andre de Toth's House of Wax (1953) -- a remake of a 1933 horror flick by Casablanca director Michael Curtiz -- is an odd movie more than anything else. Like Alfred Hitchcock's Rope, it is an experiment in film-making that -- while perhaps not the masterpiece Rope turned out to be -- deserves to be noted. De Toth decided to film the picture with a "natural 3-D" lens, which gave the equivalent of a Surround Sound experience nowadays and more depth-oriented images (as a side-note, de Toth was blind in one eye and was never able to see the final result). This technique makes for interesting viewing on a small screen nowadays, since you can practically pinpoint all the scenes that were thrown in for the sole purpose of enhancing the "3-D" feel (i.e. a flaming stool thrown at the camera, a man punching at the audience, etc.), but none of this detracts from the overall entertainment value of the movie. The story follows a wax model artist (the indelible Vincent Price) whose "House of Wax" is burned by his financier for the insurance money; he's left alive, but disfigured, and he soon decides to create a NEW wax museum -- only with REAL people as the subjects. As he goes around creating corpses for his collection, he becomes obsessed with a beautiful young woman (Phyllis Kirk) who begins to uncover his scheme. The story itself is very Phantom of the Opera meets Frankenstein, but House of Wax somehow stands aside if only for how odd it is: in a time when most horror movies were being filmed from a more suspenseful angle, de Toth went for straight scares. So even though the film doesn't get beneath your skin the way a Hitchcock thriller would, it was never meant to: de Toth simply wanted to make a straight horror movie with mass appeal, and he happened to have done it rather well. Yet despite its rather direct intentions, the film -- whether intentionally or unintentionally -- does convey an underlying message regarding our society's morbid obsession with the macabre: Price's museum is a failure at first because his sculptures are all beautiful, but as soon as he creates a "House of Horror" of sorts, crowds flock to visit. While I sincerely doubt any of this was meant to be taken as anything more than a theme, it still makes for an interesting movie experience. The performances are fun all-around, with Prince being his quirky self and a cameo by Charles Bronson (yes, THAT Charles Bronson) as an assistant named Igor (okay, so maybe it does border on plagiarism every now and then: so what?). House of Wax is no masterpiece, but that was never its goal: it is pure campy horror kitsch, and it works. If I have one beef with the picture, its that it perhaps doesn't always get the most out of its cheap frights. An early scene comes to mind in which a mortician explains that at times dead bodies sit up as a result of the embalming process: wouldn't it have been interesting if, while visitors were browsing Price's museum, one of his corpses abruptly popped up? Talk about kitsch!Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy, suspenseful yet beautiful with a great performance from Price- also a great 3D experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me, House of Wax is a very good movie, but I am not sure if it is Price's best horror film. I did prefer the Corman-Price-Poe collaborations Pit and the Pendulum, The Raven, The Fall of the House of Usher and especially The Masque of the Red Death. The story occasionally loses bite and Phyllis Kirk is a rather bland female lead(though in all fairness her character is as well). Conversely, the Gothic sets look gorgeous and add a real sensual beauty to a lot of scenes. The photography is just as lavish. On the subject of visuals, I had the pleasure of watching House of Wax in 3D, I am not a fan of 3D and find it distracts from the film and doesn't focus on the story enough. In the case of House of Wax however, not only does the 3D look good, but it enhances the scares without making them gimmicky. Igor appearing to have leapt out of the audience was a standout. House of Wax is fine in 2D, but even better in 3D in my view, and I thought I'd never say that. The music is haunting and robust, the writing is sharp and the story is suspenseful and mostly exciting. There are some very effective scenes, such as the sight of the figure in the cloak, Jarrod chasing Sue down the alleyways(pure suspense and horror), the murders especially that of Jarrod's partner, the heart-breaking scene where Jarrod tries in vain to save his wax works and Sue strapped nude on the table in the climax. The wax works are very creepy as well. The pace is brisk and the direction handles the atmosphere very well. The performances are very good on the whole, Carolyn Jones went on to do better things but is interesting to see. Frank Lovejoy is great at just playing it straight, Reggie Rymal provides another of the 3D's finest moments with the paddle-ball and Charles Bronson is wonderfully creepy even without uttering a word. Best of all is Vincent Price in his first array into horror and for me still one of his best roles, his make-up is exceptional and he is very malevolent and sympathetic, a type of role that always saw him at his best. Looking at him also, you'd never guess that it was his first horror role, he looks as though he'd done it for years beforehand. In conclusion, a very good film and a great 3D experience. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Henry Jarrod is a very talented sculptor of wax figures for a museum. But as the museum starts to flounder, Jarrod's partner, Matthew Burke, insists on taking a new direction, a row ensues and Jarrod is knocked unconscious. Burke seizes the opportunity to torch the museum and get the insurance money, with Jarrod still in the premises. Thought long since dead, Jarrod resurfaces, apparently wheel chair bound and with horribly burned hands. Opening up a new museum, his new figures {made by his protégé under his instruction} look ever more lifelike than before, could he be responsible for some despicable crimes in the area?.This marvellous film is a remake of the 1933 chiller, The Mystery Of The Wax Museum, directed by Michael Curtiz. Here this film is taken on by Andre de Toth, originally filmed in 3-D with the then bonus addition of Warner Phonic Sound, it's a picture that thankfully holds up real well even in its basic flat format. The reason it does hold up well is because director de Toth didn't get carried away with the gimmick, it's used sparingly so the narrative never gets lost amongst any trickery, and thus House Of Wax's excellently creepy story comes to the fore.Having the ever supreme Vincent Price as your leading man {Jarrod} will always help your horror genre picture, here he two folds the performance brilliantly. At first his Jarrod is charming and carrying a grace about his dedication to his craft, but then, devilment takes control as Price pumps creepy ardour into Jarrod's fractured mind. Quite a turn from Price who most definitely suffered for his art during the shoot, forced to do his own stunts {the 3D process needs more than one camera}, he was involved in an accident that set him on fire and almost saw him crushed!. Then there was the long and often painful make up sessions to get the desired effects of a burns victim, layers of rubber strangling his skin to the point of passing out, oh yes Vincent earned his money on this one!.We even get one of the earliest credited performances from Charles Bronson {here under his real name of Buchinsky} as Jarrod's assistant Igor, whilst fans of The Addams Family TV series will no doubt enjoy the performance of future Mortica, Carolyn Jones. The film was a big success on its release, and hugely popular with critics, and it's not hard to see why, because today it still stands proud as one of the finest exponents of classic horror, both as a story and as a technical construction. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>terrific performance by Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This would be a film that created the perfect marriage between the great Vincent Price and the horror genre. He was always brilliant at conveying the madness of men and the darkness that lurks behind the eyes. In this film, Price portrays Henry Jarrod, a passionate wax sculpter who loved his works and treated them as if they breathed life. A co-partner named Matthew Burke(Roy Roberts)who funded the cash to get Jarrod's wax museum off the ground is a greedy sort who wants instant payoff and success decides to take it upon himself to burn down the museum for insurance money. Jarrod couldn't dare have his works destroyed and tries fervently to stop Burke. Burke is able to get out with Jarrod succumbing to bad burns to his face and arms. Jarrod is also quite mad and loses his love at sculpting and inlists Igor(played by a really young Bronson)to help him capture bodies from New York City's morgue for waxing. Jarrod murders Burke and hangs him using this deed as an exhibit in his new museum..a museum of the macabre. This new museum show means of death and mutilation from past murders such as John Wilkes Booth and the first man to die in the electric chair. Price finds Sue Allen going through his exhibits(played by Phyllis Kirk)and finds she looks like his Marianne Antoinette work that was destroyed in the fire. Jarrod was passionate about that work and decides to recreate it. Sue notices that the Joan Of Arc looks like her friend Cathy(Carolyn Jones)who was murdered by a disfigured man. We notice that Jarrod has a normal face in his opening of the exhibit. We find out later the face was sculpted so Jarrod could roam free during the day "normal." Yet at night, Jarrod could lurk the streets for fresh corpses for his exhibit. The film would appear to be quite campy to casual horror watchers. I thought Price was simply outstanding showing a sadness because of his condition, yet a hidden insanity that comes out from this condition. The other cast is pretty average. Also, the film suffers from the gimmicky 3D it tries to throw at the viewer. I recommend watching this for Price and a really well made ending. ****/*****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`There is a pain beyond pain!,' Vincent Price menacingly says to his leading lady, Phyllis Kirk, towards film's end. This was, in my view, the highlight of Price's breakthrough role, that of the tortured Prof. Henry Jarrod as the horribly disfigured and criminally insane sculptor of wax likenesses. House of Wax was indeed Price's breakthrough role. It re-defined how horror was presented and how we, the viewing audience, perceived it for almost 20 years. It was not until 1973's The Exorcist that the horror genre experienced it's next substantial metamorphosis. Vincent Price was 42 years old in 1953, the year of House of Wax's release, and he had until this time experienced a busy but unspectacular career. House of Wax changed all that, catapulting him into the international stardom he so richly deserved. Many have imitated but never duplicated this film, which is a true masterpiece. That it holds up well 50 years after it's release date is a tribute in itself, especially for a 3D horror film. Price portrays the mad Jarrod, done dirty by a business partner and tragically burned as he attempts to keep said partner from burning his studio for insurance money. Surviving the fire, the now mad Jarrod goes on a killing spree to find models for his new wax figures. The thing is, they are not figures, they are the actual victims under a thin layer of wax, causing the viewing public touring his new studio to believe he is a wax genius. He is a genius, all right, a mad, criminal genius. One of his victims is the friend of Sue Allen, ably played by Phyllis Kirk, whom I wish we would have seen more of during her screen career. Ms. Kirk joins the list of ladies I admire as `scream queens,' and she plays the role of anguished gal pal with impressive emotion. Sue figures Jarrod out early on and much of the film is spent with Jarrod trying to do away with her. The scene where we see Jarrod chasing Sue down the dark alleys of New York is pure classic horror and is one that has been duplicated too often to recount. The always pleasing Frank Lovejoy portrayed Police Lt. Brennan but another thing of personal interest to me were several other members of the supporting cast. Dabs Greer was Sgt. Jim Shane and younger readers may remember him still going strong in 1999's The Green Mile, filmed 46 years later. A very young Charles Buchinsky, AKA Charles Brandon, was Igor, the mute servant of Jarrod. House of Wax has a fairly stock ending but that is OK. Young Sue is rescued from the wax vat just in the nick of time to be happily re-united with her boyfriend, portrayed by Paul Picerni. A word should be said about director Andre de Toth. de Toth had only one eye and limited depth perception. It is a fine credit to him that he was responsible for one of the best 3D pictures ever made. House of Wax is a remake of 1933's Mystery of The Wax Museum and in turn, resembles 1966's Chamber of Horrors. By all means rent or buy this one; it is true classic horror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 3D horror classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This horror film is one of the first of the genre to employ the novel 3D gimmick and it works quite well in this tense chiller. Vincent Price is the mastermind who creates stunning, life-like wax figures for his museum after his original was destroyed, but the mad sculptor is not above taking short cuts to achieve his artistic and box office successes. Price, suave and debonair in spite of his misfortune, enjoys the rave reviews of his enterprise, but suspicions here and there begin to unravel his grand scheme and a darker, unpleasant side brings out the worst in him. Price is indeed frightening as events spiral out of his control, and Charles Bronson lends a hand as a deaf and crazed mute in the sculptor's underground horror chamber. Frank Lovejoy plays it straight as the detective on the case. The camera work, cast and sets are good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well crafted film of thrills and morbidness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1953's House Of Wax was a success in it's first release during the 1950's 3-D trend. It reappeared in the early 80's with a PG rating during the renewed interest in 3-D films. House Of Wax is the story of Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price), who loses his mind and original waxworks when a greedy business partner resorts to arson. Jarrod nearly lost his life in the fire at the waxworks, and was thought to have been dead. He reappears opening a bigger and better House Of Wax in turn-of-the-century New York City. Jarrod resorts to murder and stealing corpses from the morgue to create his new wax figures. He has the help of two criminals (one played by a young Charles Bronson) to assist him carry out the mayhem to create the wax figures. Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk), discovers one of the murders, and is chased by the maniac. Sue is very suspicious of Jarrod when one of his wax figures resembles her murdered friend (Carolyn Jones.) House Of Wax is a very well crafted thriller that contains elements of the morbid, and some relief with humor. The film is colorful when color applies to a situation, and dark when situations are of terror or a grim nature. The burning and melting effects of the wax figures in the beginning add nice touches of morbidness, and there are many props throughout the House Of Wax that add nice touches of the bizarre. The music is creepy and effective. Humor used in the film may seem overacted at times (the three ladies visiting the House Of Wax), or weirdly morbid (the morgue workers.) The film is well acted, and Vincent Price's performance is very fine. House Of Wax is a well crafted thriller that is fun and entertaining in both the flat and 3-D prints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Awfully fun, only intermittently scary, this movie never takes itself too seriously, which is a good thing, as it is about a sensitive sculptor who revenges himself on his crooked business partner who sets his studio on fire and then begins a...well, you get the picture. The color is very good, and the back lot recreation of late 19th century New York is dazzling and, like so much else about this movie, both artificial and yet somehow just real enough in its suggestion of life to permit a degree of emotional involvement. House Of Wax was the first major film to be made in 3D, and a huge hit in its day. This was the movie that launched Vincent Price on his road to horror movie stardom, and he plays the leading role with more delicacy and feeling than one might expect. He does not, in other words, camp it up here, as he later did, and elicits genuine sympathy, not merely pity, in the viewer. The supporting cast is quite good, and some of them, notably Charles Bronson and Carolyn Jones, went on to bigger things.For those who enjoy the macabre, this is a good show, though I suppose by today's standards it's not too frightening.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly enjoyable 50's horror film from Warner Bros. In fact, it was the first 3-D picture the studio produced, and it is considered as Vincent Price's first horror movie after 15 years of serious, dramatic or comedy roles. I consider this to be one of my favorite movies of all time, and I honestly cannot justify why, but I think its largely due to the crisp technicolor cinematography and lavish turn-of-the-century settings.Also, Price gives a hammy, but interesting performance as the derranged wax sculptor who makes a come-back with his new wax museum that contains a "chamber of horrors."It is also interesting to see Carolyn Jones in a supporting role, who later became famous as Morticia Adams on the Adams Family; and to see a young Charles Bronson playing a deaf mute. This was a remake of a 1933 Warner Bros. film called MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, which I have seen and is quite good for its day, but its nowhere near as good as the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andre de Toth directs with polish in this true horror classic about a demented artist/sculptor that uses real bodies for inspiration. Vincent Price plays the mad artist with conviction, realism, and flair, adding the usual Price touches of charm, tongue-in-cheek humour, and a certain grace. The rest of the cast is effective, no one really standing out, however. Charles Bronson and Carolyn Jones have small roles. The best part of the film, other than Price's performance, are some of the suspenseful scenes carefully directed by de Toth. The best is a chase scene through lamp-lit streets. Heroine Phyllis Kirk, having just discovered the death of her friend and the murderer still there, flees out a window into the streets to be chased by a cloaked figure, hobbling with the face of something truly hideous and horrible. The scene is frightening, and certainly the inspiration of later directors such as Mario Bava(a very similar scene takes place in Bava's Baron Blood). An excellent film and a great one to watch in the dark.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price is truly one of the most gifted horror film actors, in the ranks of Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Lon Chaney, Jr. In this film he portrays an innocent wax museum curator whose lifetime accomplishments and dreams are destroyed in a savage fire after a nasty fight with his crooked accountant. As a result of the fire he is also badly disfigured and sets out to avenge this horrible fate on innocent people. I remember my parents seeing this film in 3-D as I was too young at the time. They often talked about it and hoped that one day the 3-D effect could be reproduced for TV.One of my favorite highlights was paddle-ball whiz Reggie Rymel as the barker (whatever happened to him?) I first saw him perform on "The Spike Jones Show" and his handling of the paddle ball is absolutely breathtaking. (I could never figure out how to hit the stupid ball let alone catch it in my mouth!) See this film, folks, especially on a dark, stormy night.You'll shudder yet appreciate this masterpiece for the classic that it is!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Vincent Price!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here's the film that put Vincent Price on the horror map and redefined his career. His wonderfully unhinged performance as Professor Jarod is one that you should not miss. Price chews up the scenery and has a great time doing it. It would have been great to see it in 3D but I don't even know if you can get 3D on home video. But don't let that stop you from checking this one out. There is also a fine supporting cast including Frank Lovejoy, Phyllis Kirk, and a very dasterly Roy Roberts. Price plays a scuplter who takes his work just a little too seriously, especially after Roberts sets his wax mueseum on fire with Vinnie in it. The rest of the film focusses on Price's revenge, as it were. Also check out a very young Carolyn Jones (the future Morticia Adams). Check it out, you won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price offers up a magnificent tale of terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1953 version of 'House of Wax' is notable for two main reasons. First and foremost, it helped the brilliant Vincent Price enormously on his journey to becoming the greatest horror icon of all time. His performance in this film is like a blueprint for what he would go on to achieve, and some of his later roles; including, most notably, Dr Phibes and Edward Lionheart from Theatre of Blood, where Price effectively plays the same role as he does in House of Wax. The second thing that House of Wax is famous for is that it has pretty much become a blueprint in itself, for films in which someone is wronged and decides to take their revenge. Of course, the story itself has a number of influences; from the classic tale of 'The Phantom of the Opera', to the obvious, the film that it was remade from; Michael Curtiz's 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum'. The plot of the film follows an artist who owns a wax museum. His partner and main financier to the business, however, isn't happy with the way things are going and, as he wants to recoup the money he's invested in the museum to spend elsewhere, he decides to set the place on fire to claim the insurance. Caught in the flames, our artist manages to survive; albeit badly deformed, and bearing a huge grudge...The reason why Vincent Price works so well within the horror genre is that he's always dark and malevolent enough to be frightening, yet he's always got enough of a sympathy vote for us to feel for his plight and thereby connect with his character. Price is at his best when he's walking a fine line between evil and pathos; and that's exactly what he does here. Andres De Toth clearly knew what he wanted to do with this film, as the slightly understated presence that the original had has been changed to a much more exuberant, Gothic feel; and it does the film no end of favours, especially where the atmosphere is concerned. Throughout, the film presents the audience with large structures and rooms with ornate furnishing, and it helps to create the macabre art feel that the film is aiming for. Wax figures have always had something sinister about them, and the director has capitalised on that to great effect. The scenes that see them melting are superb, and the way the lifeless dolls stare at the other pieces of scenery helps to give the film an extra level of horror to work from. On the whole; House of Wax may well be one of the most important horror films ever made. And even if it's not...it still offers a damn good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly enough, this is actually pretty good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie because my father told me of a horror movie which scared the heck out of him and his friends when he was 16 years old... that movie turned out to be a Vincent Price movie... this one. After much searching, we finally found the film, and so we sat down to see the movie. He saw it in order to find out if he would still be scared by it, after all these years... I saw it in order to find out if it was really that good. My father tends to have great taste in movies, but occasionally he just gets drawn in by a theme or plot that he loves, and forget to think about the quality of the film. I must admit, I hadn't expected that much from the film... I was surprised by how effective and exciting it was. I haven't seen too many movies featuring Vincent Price, but now I may just have to. His acting was the best in the movie and he stole the show for every scene he was in. The plot is pretty good, though the story is pretty much just a reworking of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde(gentleman by day, monster by night) with a wax museum curator instead of a doctor. The pacing is very good. I was hardly bored for a second during the whole movie, which is surprising for such an old film. The acting is decent, with Price being the only actor to truly transcend above mediocrity with his performance. The characters are well-written and credible, with a few glaringly obvious exceptions(you'll know them when you see them). The dialog is fairly well-written and interesting, not long-winded and dull as one might expect from a slightly unknown horror film from that time period. I can't help but compare much of the dialog to the dialog of more modern films, and immediately see that this film(among others) has had an impact on film-making that is still clearly visible today. That's quite impressive, I think. Only a few other films can claim that. The horror and suspense in the film is quite good, and there are plenty of genuine(unforced) scares in the film... Vincent Price really brings the character alive, and few have managed to startle me as much as him. The makeup work was quite impressive as well, considering the time it was made. The film has a few nods to Hitchcock, but they might have been coincidental. For such an old horror film, it's really good. It's rarely dull, has some good scares and the story is pretty good too. And if for nothing else, watch the film for Price's great performance. I recommend it to most fans of horror movies, as long as you keep in mind when the film was made. Don't expect too many intense cuts or a particularly original story. The base of the story is basically the story of Jekyll and Hyde. Keep that in mind, and you'll probably enjoy the film immensely, as I did. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not his best work but Price is Still the Man</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a decent little Vincent Price film. The pace is a bit slow at times but there are some fascinating twists and turns, and it is a good novelty piece but overall this one seems to have lost its impact over time. In this movie Vincent Price plays a wax museum owner who is a little too close to the wax dummies he creates. His partner who does not think the museum is profitable burns down his place. Price's character is presumed dead.Meanwhile a series of strange murders occur. No one is sure who is responsible. A girl is murdered, a wealthy girl of means. We then find out Price's character has survived the fire and is in a wheel chair. A friend of the murdered girl finds a wax figure that looks a lot like her murdered friend. Meanwhile there have been some mysterious disappearances from the morgue, so what does it all mean? Watch and find out.This is a good movie but the scares ware off quite a bit over time. The acting is not particularly good and there is not enough of the star in the movie. Price is excellent but he is in the movie so little. It was probably scary and extremely morbid at the time but it just seems like a novelty piece today. It is interesting to see Carolyn Jones and Charles Bronson in early parts as well. The finale is a classic though, and a very good scene. The movie is good and the period timeframe as well as the interesting wax figures add to the movie. There is little else to say about the movie.</fullReview>

Special effects were great for an early 50's flick. Vincent Price was great as the evil Professor Jarrod. I loved watching the wax figures destruct.Creepy and sinister Jarrod is forced to rebuild his wax museum and begins using actual people as his wax subjects. This movie has the right amount of suspense and little moments to make you jump.Rounding out the cast are Charles Bronson, Carolyn Jones, Frank Lovejoy and character actor Dabbs Greer.It is said that director Andre De Toth did not get overly excited about the original 3D process, because he only had sight in one eye. That in itself is amazingly strange.</fullReview>

You may be suspicious the next time that you go to a wax museum (I went to the wax museum in Newport about a month after I saw this, and I commented on it; they assured me that what is portrayed in "House of Wax" does not reflect their institution).It's also interesting seeing Charles Bronson in a young role (as Price's assistant). The movie also has Carolyn Jones, eleven years before she became Morticia Addams. But anyway, this is another movie that shows what a great actor Vincent Price was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic and frightening horror movie with an awesome acting by Vincent Price as a revenger sculptor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a famous film for its pioneering use of 3-D , and the most popular the era in this format , a status it retains today . An associate burns down a wax museum with the owner (Vincent Price as a wax-dummy maker , this role launched on his terror film cycle , especially for Roger Corman) inside, but he survives only to become vengeful and murderous . As the deranged sculptor rebuilds his fire-destroyed showplace , as he creates a sinister wax museum which showcases amazing figures . The sculptor after a disfiguring face resorts to murder , strange experiments and installs wax-covered corpses . When he meets his new assistant's nice friend, Sue Allen , (Phyllis Kirk , though Joan Weldon and Vera Miles were both contenders for the role of Sue Allen ; Phyllis said that she had "no fond memories" of working with Charles Bronson) he knows he's found the perfect model . This is an remake of the early horror flick and one of the 50s most popular 3-D films and it was the first film released with a stereophonic soundtrack . This is a chiller story with grisly horror , genuine thrills and shocks . This was reportedly Warner Brothers' one of the biggest success and the first 3-D color movie ever to be produced by a major American studio . The eerie story contains bit good fun with killings , chilling interpretations , relentless horror and thrilling events . The chiller version of the 50s packs scary chills and terrifying deaths . The wax figures are the real stars of this production , being rightly realized . Some scenes are clumsily shot but the movie has some good moments here and there , the illogical parts in the argument are more than compensated for the excitement provided by the creepy wax models , eerie killers and many other things . This one stills has the power to give the audience the creeps , thanks to another extraordinary acting by Vincent Price . Fine support cast such as Frank Lovejoy , Charles Bronson credited as Charles Buchinsky, Angela Clarke , Roy Roberts , Paul Cavanagh , Carolyn ¨Morticia Adams¨as a victim and Nedrick Young, who plays the alcoholic assistant Leon, was uncredited because he had been blacklisted during the McCarthy "Red scare" era in Hollywood . Rousing and suspenseful original music by David Buttolph . Colorful as well as glimmer cinematography with brilliant colors by Bert Glennon . This creepy and gory horror movie was professionally by director André De Toth - who was blind in one eye and hence could not see the effect . Andre De Toth was a classical director , Western usual (Indian fighter, Man in the saddle, Ramrod , Last of Comanches , The stranger wore a gun), but also made Peplum (Gold for the Caesar) and adventure (The Mongols , Morgan the pirate , Tanganyika) .Other films dealing with ¨House of wax¨ are the followings : 1933 vintage horror classic and rarely seen ¨Mystery of the wax museum¨ , here main starring was a heroin addict but that had to be changed for the remake, it was starred by Lionel Atwill , Fay Wray , Glenda Farrell ; ¨Terror in the Wax Museum¨ (1973) by George Fenady with Ray Milland , Elsa Lanchester , Maurice Evans , John Carradine , Patrick Knowles , ¨Waxwork¨ (1988) by Anthony Hickcock with Zach Galligan , Joe Baker , Deborah Foreman , Michelle Johnson , David Warner .

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Great 3D special effects as well as acting by Vincent Price as the deranged &amp; disfigured sculpture Henry Jarrod makes the remake of the 1933 horror classic "House of Wax" even better then the original. Jarrod who was burned beyond recognition when his wax museum was set on fire, in order to collect $25,000.00 in insurance, by his greedy stock broker partner Matthew Burke,Roy Roberts, came back later looking the "Phantom of the Opra", without his mask on, to exact revenge on him. That by leaving Burke hanging at the end of a rope in his office buildings elevator shaft.Now wheelchair bound and unable to use his skillful hands to create his masterpieces, human wax figures, Jarrod had amassed a number of very unscrupulous characters, mostly ex-convicts, to do his work including his #1 assistant the deft mute but immensely strong and built like a world champion body builder Igor played by a then Charles Buchinsky before he changed or Anglicized his name to Charles Bronson. Having his gang of grave robbers raiding the local morgues in the city Jarrod has the stiffs or bodies encased in wax and put on display in his museum. It's pretty Sue Allen, Phillis Kirk, who smells or sees a rat in Jarrod's work when she spots the figure of Joan of Arc at the museum who's an exact or spitting image of her good friend Cathy Gray, Carolyn Jones, who was brutally murdered a few years ago! Not only that Sue's body disappeared from the city morgue before it could be autopsied and buried! ****SPOILERS**** As we already knew Henry Jarrod wasn't the helpless cripple has he lead everyone on to believing. He was one of the grave or morgue robbers who kidnapped bodies that he used in his ghastly work at the wax museum. With Sue, his next potential victim, putting the finger on him Jarrod, was was in the process of turning Sue into a wax dummy of Mary Antoinette, goes completely bonkers which leads to the films, together with Henry Jarrod, final and explosive climax!P.S It's the movie "House of Wax" that made Vincent Price the horror movie Hollywood legend that he eventually became. Besides a few mostly comedic roles, that he made fun of himself in, Price was almost exclusively cast in horror films and built up over the years a such a large following that even now years after his death he's universally recognized and loved by legions of his admirers. Most of them who weren't even born when he was literally knocking em dead on the silver as well as small,TV,screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First-rate horror film, in either 2- or 3-D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Simply put, I love this film. I first saw it in 3-D in a local independent theater in the 1970's, a small place that was well-known for doing unusual things like screening in 3-D or having a live organist play for a silent film. It scared me (I was about 10), but I loved it. I watch it again every chance I get.Oh, it's not perfect. Phyllis Kirk's performance is a bit wooden, in my opinion. And the boyfriend, played by Paul Picerni, might as well not have been there... in how many films are both the 'hero' and the heroine saved by the police? Scott would have lost his head and Sue would have ended up in a display case had it not been for New York's Finest. This aspect of the film has always bugged me.That said, anyone who enjoys a good old-fashioned scare now and then would be advised to give this one a try... and anyone who has ever received a paddle-ball toy for Christmas and never been able to master it will certainly get an eyeful during the classic carnival-barker sequence.

It's no more a gimmick than stereophonic sound.But the they will say oh that's different.Really?.Well I got the mother load of 3-D films on D.v.D.Guess what? A 3-D version does exist on d.v.d.. It a red and blue anaglyph ,but it pops out.Just as i saw it in 1982 in a revival version except it was Polaroid 3-D and the color were not muddy.The scene where Roy Roberts burns the museum down against Vincent Price's will,after Roy got impatient of waiting for Paul Cavanaha to come back in three month to buy the place, to get the insurance money.You see the fire pops out in real dimensions as the wax figures burn down and falls in to your lap! The funny part and rather gimmicky was the ping- pong paddle sequence, when the museum just opened.In 3-D it's effective.The music hall scene where Paul Picerni takes Phyllis Kirk out to forget the her problems,the can can scene,played with a standard Warner brothers melody,March of the soldier?in 3D it was very effective.But the emphasis on depth in the dramatic scene are good too.When Phyllis checks the Joan of Ark statue, in which the dead body of Caroline Jones is hidden,just as it was good in the theater, but color was more clear since it was Polaroid. But near the end as Sue Allen is searching for her boy friend who works for Vincent Price, Paul Picerni at the museum and it's dark,the bluish tint on the film becomes green.I don't know if it was a tint adjusting defect .It did not interfere in the 3-D.This also contain the intermission advertisement too ,when the projectionist had to put in the second reels since 3-D used two projectors.My guess the reel doubled either 400 feet to 800 feet to play the full feature with few changes.Digital print available at Sumogorilla.com 06/09/12</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of Vincent Price's Better Movies</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never been a particularly big fan of Vincent Price, but I'll give credit where credit is due. "House of Wax" is a very good movie, with a few scenes that make you jump even though they're not all that frightening (think of the guillotine slicing down just a moment too late to cut off Andrews' head) and a general sense of creepiness throughout, heightened by the fact that much of the action takes place in that most creepy of places - a wax museum, where even in the most normal of circumstances you're surrounded by these very lifelike creations. That setting was used to very good effect. The performances in the movie were of a pretty high calibre, and the story was generally a lot of fun. There wasn't a great deal not to like in this.Price played Professor Henry Jarrod. This was an interesting character, who makes a 180 degree turn in the course of the movie. As it opens, he's a gentle sculptor - a lover of beauty who creates beauty out of wax and avoids the strategy of many wax artists by refusing to depict scenes of horror and violence. The result, though, is that his museum gets little business, and his business partner finally burns the place down after a struggle with Jarrod in order to get the insurance money. But Jarrod - though he was trapped in the building and horribly burned - survives, and having gone mad as a result of his experience, he becomes a master sculptor of violence - this time using real human bodies as the foundations for his wax creations. Price pulled off both sides of Jarrod's character wonderfully. You feel some sympathy even the evil Jarrod, because you know he's gone mad - this isn't really him or what he was like. The beautiful girl who's required in these movies is here played by an actress named Phyllis Kirk, better known for television roles, but never really well known. As Sue Allen, Kirk transforms as well - from a sort of plain-Jane type (who's uncomfortable in a music hall watching dancing girls who show off their legs) at the start of the film to a very beautiful woman who becomes Jarrod's choice to be Marie Antoinette in his new house of horrors. The movie has a very suspenseful turn after Sue is captured by Jarrod, who's prepared to coat her still living body in boiling wax. Those scenes are interesting; Kirk becomes a vaguely erotic subject to be honest. This was 1953. It's never pictured, of course, but Sue is clearly naked on the table as the wax is being prepared. The various shots of her struggling against her restraints are clearly intended to make that point.This is an enjoyable movie; one of the better that I've seen of Vincent Price's work. I chuckled quietly when I discovered that one of Jarrod's assistants in his house of horrors was a deaf mute named Igor. Does every mad doctor (even a mad sculptor) need an Igor? Could anything have been more cliché? But that was just amusing. It didn't detract from the movie at all. (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price saves "House of Wax" from going up in flames</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"House of Wax" hit theatres in 1953, right in the middle of the 3-D craze. Bafflingly, for this 3-D project Warner Brothers chose director André De Toth, who was blind in one eye, thus unable to fully appreciate his own film's visuals. It seems to have worked out, though, since the movie is today considered a minor classic.The movie is a remake of the 1933 Michael Curtiz film "Mystery of the Wax Museum", which is itself notable as an early use of the Technicolor process. The story concerns a gifted sculptor (Vincent Price) whose prized creations are lost when his business partner sets his studio ablaze for the insurance money. Left to perish in the fire, the sculptor narrowly escapes but is hideously scarred by the ordeal (both mentally and physically). Soon, he opens a new wax museum to instant success but his methods are called into question by an inquisitive young woman.The inimitable Vincent Price deserves a lot of the credit for the film's success. He lends a touch of class to the proceedings, though he does ham it up from time to time as well. The rest of the cast is no better than adequate, with Carolyn Jones contributing a particularly irritating performance. But, hey, at least the movie's got a young Charles Bronson in a supporting role.The film's 3-D effects mostly amount to gimmickry. The needless insertion of scenes that serve merely to showcase these effects end up hurting a script that wasn't that great to begin with. That being said, the film does achieve a sense of eeriness at times and the story is satisfying in the end.Ultimately, "House of Wax" is worth watching though it's by no means perfect. The film deserves to be remembered both for its content and its status as a curio of a bygone era in filmmaking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mad Vince's house of horrors!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In response to a complaint about the increasing number of 3-D movies being made now, an I.M.D.B. member sneered: "Its the future, pal. Get used to it!". He did not appear to know the technology to create 3-D cinema was developed originally back in the 20's. It would, however, not be until 1953 that the first official 3-D blockbuster appeared - 'House Of Wax', a remake of Lionel Atwill's creepy 'The Mystery Of The Wax Museum'. Vincent Price plays Professor Henry Jarrod, a brilliant sculptor who makes life-like wax statues based on actual historical figures such as John Wilkes Booth and Marie Antoinette. Foillowing a row with his business partner, the museum catches fire, and Jarrod is horribly disfigured. Unable to make statues any longer, he takes to kidnapping people and converting them into waxworks. Sue Allen ( Phyllis Kirk ) finds her flighty roommate Cathy Gray ( Carolyn Jones, the Addams family's 'Morticia' ) dead, and is chased by her killer, a sinister figure in a cloak. Soon afterwards, a Joan Of Arc figure appears in Jarrod's museum, and Sue recognises it as being Cathy...The great thing about 'House Of Wax' is that it is still good even without the 3-D. Andre De Toth, the director, only had one eye so it is even more of a remarkable achievement. Sequences like the man with the paddle-ball must have been tough to shoot. Audiences shrieked in terror as the burning waxworks dissolved in front of their every eyes. It might not have been actual people burning but the imagery was horrific all the same.For Price, the film changed his career, typing him forever in the public mind as a horror film star. This was also one of the first pictures of its kind to feature nudity - the climax has Sue strapped naked to a table by Jarrod. We don't see anything we shouldn't ( this was 1953, after all ), but don't need to. Kirk looks sexier than other actresses do totally nude. Charles Bronson ( credited under his real name 'Buchinsky' is 'Igor', Jarrod's mute assistant. Why are all mad scientists' sidekicks named 'Igor'? ) The basic plot was later spoofed in the comedy 'Carry On Screaming!' ( 1966 ) with Kenneth Williams in the Price role.3-D quickly palled with '50's audiences, as it did thirty years later when used on the 'Friday The 13th' and 'Jaws' franchises. While there's no denying it makes a good movie better, it can also be used to prop up some pretty dreadful films. It remains to be seen whether present-day audiences will also tire of 3-D or endorse it as the norm for movies from now on. James Cameron, whose 'Avatar' provoked the current 3-D revival, thinks the latter. We shall see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price makes this film a ScareFest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched the "House of Wax" Remake and I found that a good little flick. When I watched the Original 1953 version, I was just so stoked. I never knew i would like this scarefest that much. I thought I would have given this film an 8 or 9, but boy was I wrong about that.As well as having such a high quality story that pushes out power to the viewers, Vincent Price pulls of a perfect 5/5 performance as the evil, cunning, un-expecting suspect, Henry Jared. He just made this film work a lot and that's why I loved it so much. I'm going to go through some pointers on what made this film great.Acting, 9.5/10: As well as Vincent Price's perfect performance, all the other actors did a sensational job to keep this horror classic alive in it's depths &amp; roots. There is really nothing else I can say because they were so good.Scenes, 9.5/10: Many of the scenes were pulled off well as the cunning Henry Jared pulled of tricks to shock the civilians around him that these people were clay models out of magazines, not humans. They were gullible. I also like how a lot of psychological elements were in this film. We usually see these elements in dark horror films and "House of Wax" is never shown nor is it a dark film in any way. it was just so amazing on how they could pull off this classic stuff back in "53".Scares, 8/10: There isn't much to say about the scares. At many turns there were many scares for me. Espcieally when Henry Jared (As the deformed, burned man) chased a woman around the street. Most of those times were scary as he was like a founding fiend just walking around the blue streets. His shadows over the walls creeped me out. For a 1953 film the scares are still there (especially when Vincent is on screen) but never the less saying, the film's scares are pretty tame. I will say it creeped me out.House of Wax is a great film, and seeing it now in comparison to the remake, it is top notch. New fans will most likely go for the remake because there is more cheese, gore and anything else. The remake was an OK flick like I said in the review that i did. Now seeing the original, i wish the remake had done one thing. Follow the original story. I say watch the original first and then give the remake a try. Both films are good but the more powerful film out of the two is the 1953 classic.9.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Film, But Over-hyped for Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) gets in a fight with his business partner, and he is caught in a raging fire, disfiguring himself. Once he returns to normal, or as normal as he can be, he starts working in wax again, but this time has a sinister method to his process. Also features a very young Charles Bronson.Regarding the film, Ivan Butler says it has a "lack of imaginative treatment", though we must admit that "its success helped make Price synonymous with the horror genre", as Howard Maxford says. For me, it was average, pushed u pa little by Price, but vastly overrated as a classic or one of the all-time greats.For a Vincent Price film, I'll take his work with Roger Corman or William Castle over this any say. Or "The Mad Magician" which came out the following year... a better film, but little known.This film, by the way, has little or nothing to do with "House of Wax" in 2005 (the Paris Hilton one), so don't waste your time comparing them.</fullReview>

Case in point, House of Wax.Price starts out as a pretty nice guy...although ever so slightly bonkers. Betrayal turns him into a monster. The difference in his underlying personality is striking.Some interesting scenes in this one: The girl running through empty streets after dark being stalked by a killer. In most movies, as soon as the woman screamed and ran, the killer would've run off. In this movie, she is pursued for what seems like an eternity. Like a bad dream.The movie was released in 3-D. It was funny to watch the scenes especially shot to take advantage of that technology: Can can dancers, a performer with a paddle-ball game...This is an enjoyable movie with only a few deaths, but a lot of nice thrills. See it...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vincent Price, waxwork figures, disfigured villain and 3D. What a delicious mixture! "House of Wax" was a remake of the 1933 film "Mystery of the Wax Museum" that's starred Lionel Atwill and Fay Wray. On par with the original, if maybe a little more sensationally fun in its gimmicky execution. Some moments are virtually scene by scene, but also there are twists to certain plot devices and character changes of its predecessor? surprisingly the risky and darker instances are gone. In a way I found the story to lack the bite, as it routinely unfolded despite keeping the imaginative concept. Although we got a lot more shocks and atmospherics from its back lot sets with our disfigured villain getting up to a lot more trouble - where Vincent Price given free reign would be relishing every moment lurking around under the hideous make-up. It's a standout performance by an animated Price, knowing where to be wicked and smoothly delivering the dialogues. You could probably see it as the starting point for his horror career. Carolyn Jones was likable enough, but didn't really leave a mark. Also there's an early role for a young, imposing Charles Bronson as a death mute working under wax sculptor Pro. Henry Jarred. Andre De Toth's breezy direction displays some suspenseful acts, well-etched art direction details and crisp cinematography with it backed up a by swirlingly robust orchestra music score. An entertainingly theatrical Gothic chiller that gives you the sense that those eyes really do seem to follow you around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price stands out in this horror, surrounded by dummies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>André De Toth's classic horror movie (originally released in 3-D AND a remake, nonetheless) remains, to this day, a highly entertaining and enjoyable outing thanks to it featuring both Vincent Price and a waxwork museum, both things that I feel improve any genre outing.The tale is a familiar one to fans. A great wax sculptor (played by Price) is horribly burned after a betrayal and then returns to find new fame and glory with a selection of waxwork figures that are . . . . . . all too realistic.While there's nothing here to actually scare modern horror fans, there's a lot here to love. The main performances, from both Price and Phyllis Kirk (playing Sue Allen, the lady who suspects something amiss when she spies a replica of Joan Of Arc that looks a hell of a lot like her dead friend), are fantastic and the support from the likes of Paul Picerni, Charles Bronson (billed here under his original title, Charles Buchinsky), Paul Cavanagh and everyone else involved is all just as good. Okay, I find Carolyn Jones a bit annoying but her screen time is mercifully short.Although viewed nowadays in 2-D it's still fun to note the little touches that were obviously created to entertain in the third dimension (specifically, the title sequence and a wonderful, entertaining moment with a talented bat and ball man) and although some scenes may feel as if they dwell on the artificiality of the waxwork creations and the sculptor's passion for making them realistic it always feels very much like a parallel to the making of the movie itself.A layered, robust piece of entertainment that, like the waxwork dummies themselves, may not hold up under the closest scrutiny but that does a fantastic job when viewed in just the right way.See this if you like: Mystery Of The Wax Museum, House Of Wax, Waxwork.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic VS nuhorror - and former wins handsdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film originally filmed in 3-D, this remake of 1930's Mystery of Wax Museum made Vincent Price a horror star. It is also interesting to compare this film to the 2005 version, which was - to put it bluntly - garbage. In the 1953 script by Charles Belden and Crane Wilbur, which was filmed in gorgeous, rich colours, atmospheric 19th century sets and nice costumes, Vincent Price plays good man driven to murder by a greedy man who does not understand beauty. He is insane, both lethal and sympathetic. In 2005, the villainous characters are sleazy, scummy perverts, who torture people to create unimpressive wax works. Colours are now washed-out and ugly, and clean and literate dialogue - including Price's great speech in the climax - is replaced with foul-mouthed teen nattering. And the cast - ah, the cast! I understand that they could not dig late Vincent Price from his grave, but "sexy" young cast was especially uncharismatic and scruffy-looking lot. In 1953 version, one of the highlights is a scene where the killer chases pretty rosy-cheeked heroine (Phyllis Kirk) in Victorian streets. In 2005 version it was... yes, what? Torture scenes? Please. House of Wax (1953) is a classic and genuinely good and beautiful movie, made with old-fashioned class and quality. 2005 House of Wax is ugly garbage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one of those real Vincent Price Gets Revenge movies, House of Wax, he takes this 'artist' character who makes a bunch of wax figures out of points in history (i.e. Lincoln's assassination, Joan of Arc, Marie Antoinette) and goes to town with it. This doesn't mean he's really over the top through the whole movie, on the contrary, Price going-to-town means that he shows up either in a burnt-face get-up like he's a piece of mashed-up slab of raw streak left out too long or in a wheelchair where he happily explains how he "created" these new wax figures at the museum of the title. If nothing else the movie is fun to watch because of him, to see what he'll do next with this dastardly being who kills people (namely those he's getting vengeance on like the one who swindled him out of his insurance money and burned his exhibit to the ground at the start, and some random women), and how he looks when conversing with characters like the woman he sees as being his 'masterpiece', his new Marie Antoinette.Andre de Toth creates an entertaining if not very deep or very scary horror-show with House of Wax. Not so scary in that it hasn't aged incredibly well, even if it does contain some creepy elements (such as a mute muscle-clad Charles Bronson), and some very tense scenes like when Price is chasing after the woman on the New York streets at night like he's an artiste-vampire or something. And it moves along at a good pace and has a good (if predictable) pay-off with its plot turns. And, I should note, it looks quite fabulous in color. The only big downside (aside from it not aging well and not having the best cast for all of these stock supporting characters like the insurance swindler and his girl Katie) is that since it was shot in 3D there's some gimmickry to be had. Not all of it is noticeable, and I'm sure in a 3D theater a scene like the big fire scene at the start of the movie would look impressive... but what is one to make of that guy standing outside the House of Wax museum announcing for people to come in and batting a ball and paddle AT THE SCREEN. Lame and annoying.The movie itself is fine and dandy, nothing bad and nothing great in either full sense of the word. I'm sure compared to the remake it fares much better, and for Price fans you'll get your money's worth. Watch out for Wax!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House of Wax (1953), starring Vincent Price.This is a movie that just oozes out class and charm. It's not horror in the way of splattering blood and flying body parts, but more in the lines of something unspeakable happening. Something that will set the hairs on the back of your neck on end.House of Wax tells of a wax sculptor who lives for his work. One fateful night, his workshop along with all his creations burns down. Miraculously, the sculptor escapes from the fire. He swears to take revenge upon the one who destroyed his lovely statues of wax. But he doesn't stop there...The acting is classic. It's the typical style you'd expect in a movie of that era. Vincent Price once again delivers a wonderful performance.I also have to make a note of the scenery and setting of this film. It's very charming.And of course (how can I forget) the wax sculptures. They look absolutely amazing...Go watch this classic when you get the chance. It won't be a boring ride, I guarantee it.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better as a genre movie than the original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's actually so this movie works out better than the 1933 original, due to the fact that this movie is more being an horror. It has the right style and ingredients and gets supported by a great story and cast.Basically this movie has everything in it a typical good '50's horror production should need. But what makes this movie better to watch than just the average genre movie entry from the same era is its compelling story, that perhaps is not typical horror-wise. It's also a bit of a tragic story with a tragic main character, just like is the case in "Phantom of the Opera", which is also an excellent horror story.Yet the movie foremost remains an horror, much more than was the case with the original. In this movie the 'monster' or murderer is showed with his face already very early on in the movie. He does a lot more evil. Also with Vincent Price you have a great and classy villainous main character, who can act with any material.Also look out for the still very young Charlies Bronson in a non-speaking role. He used to play lots of roles early in his career before really breaking through in the '60's.The movie also has a great atmosphere that perhaps is a bit more classy than usual is the case with an '50's genre movie. Or this perhaps is also due to the fact that this movie has a better and more compelling story than usual, which uplifts the movie on basically every level. Funny fun about this movie as well is that this was the first ever 3-D movie. It's probably also part of the reason why this movie became such an huge financial success for the Warner Bros. Studios.A great genre movie from the '50's!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this remake of 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum, Vincent Price stars as a sculptor in wax, disfigured when his partner burns down their museum for the insurance money, who sets up shop again in New York. But as his hands are disabled from the fire, he cannot do traditional wax figures anymore and turns to a much more gruesome medium.Vincent Price, as usual, shines in this one as the disgruntled sculptor, and is joined by an early and mute Charles Bronson as the assistant Igor, and Carolyn Jones (of the TV series "The Addams Family" fame) as one of the early victims of the sculptor. The acting all around is decent with little to complain about and Reggie Rymal is delightful as the barker.And like the film on which it is based, this one has a strong story and some beautiful visuals that help keep the viewer's interest throughout. I think I prefer "Mystery of the Wax Museum" with the lovely Fay Wray and the fun performance by Glenda Farrell, but House of Wax is most definitely worth a view or two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic from a long gone era of film-making</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The term Grand Guignol isn't often heard these days, but it's still present in the horror genre. The meaning hasn't really changed, but the level of violence and drama has. Movies like 'Saw' and 'Hostel' and their sequels have taken this to new heights much to the dismay of the squeamish. But in the glory days of Hollywood it was classier and more tastefully done. Now don't get me wrong, I like gore and grue as much as the next guy, but it's always nice to go back and watch those films that were more restrained, thus sometimes making them more effective. The original 'House of Wax' being one of the best examples of this. More than half a century old, it still holds up quite well and is a treat for those who are either tired of the mainstream horror of today or never liked that in the first place.Pros: First rate performances. A grand and at times eerie score. Excellent work done on the wax figures and make-up effects. Plenty of spooky atmosphere care of fog and dark city streets. A good dark sense of humor. Moves at a good steady pace. Fabulous period costumes designs, on both the actors and wax statues. An exciting finale.Cons: Very dated. Some of the sets look awfully cheap.Final thoughts: Forget the 2005 remake (Although it does have some of it's own merits), this is the real deal. A good old fashioned and deliciously wicked classic horror picture starring one of the greats, Vincent Price. Perfect for Halloween night or a drive-in double feature. And don't worry if it's not in 3-D, because it's still well above average in 2-D.My rating: 4/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1953 horror film is both climatic and exhilarating for it's inventiveness and sense of true dread. Despite the similar name, the 2005 Paris Hilton slasher is no comparison to it's grandfatherly namesake. Here Vincent Price portrays a brilliant sculptor of wax figurines that was horribly burned and paralyzed in an arson's fire caused by an enemy. Years later, he decides to reopen a house of wax, this time with the assistance of ygor, (Charles Bronson) and with the full awesomeness of his talents. The figures are much more human-like, and the attention to detail is eery. At the same time, there are several disappearances of New York denizens, and no, this is no small coincidence. Here director Andre De Toth, known more for his western and noir work, crafts an eery setting of the dark and murky streets of predawn New York. His mastery of both the chilling atmosphere and the artistic vision of his surprising and disturbing climax, make for a most enjoyable movie watching experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rise Of Vincent Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most true Horror fans will agree with my opinion that Vincent Price was one of the most brilliant actors who ever lived. While André De Toth's "House Of Wax" of 1953 is not one of the most brilliant films Price has ever starred in, it is definitely a great one, and, especially, an immensely important and influential one. What makes "House Of Wax" film especially essential to any lover of Horror or cineaste in general is the fact that this is the film that made Price a Horror icon. Sure, he had been in great films before. Price's early repertoire includes roles in such brilliant films as Otto Preminger's Film-Noir masterpiece "Laura" (1944) or "Dragonwyck" (1946), in which he also starred alongside Gene Tierney. It was "House Of Wax" however, that made Price one of the most popular leading men in Horror cinema, which subsequently made him one of the greatest (for me personally THE greatest) Horror icons in the history of motion pictures.In early 20th century New York, Professor Henry Jarrod (Price) is an ingenious sculptor who runs a wax museum with his business partner. When the business partner sets the museum on fire in order to collect the insurance money, all of Jarrod's wax sculptures melt down, and the artist himself survives only by miracle. Years later, when he has still not yet quite recovered from his injuries, Jarrod opens a wax museum again. His wax museum includes many incredibly lifelike sculptures of famous historic people, as well as a chamber of Horrors. Some visitors, especially young Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) cannot help but recognize something sinister about the devoted sculptor and his wax museum, especially since some of his Wax figures bear strong resemblances to people who have been murdered or disappeared...Vincent Price is, as always, brilliant in the role of Professor Jarrod. No one has ever portrayed madmen and other sinister characters as ingeniously as Price did, which, plain and simple, makes him one of the greatest actors ever. Phyllis Kirk makes a nice female lead, and the supporting cast includes non other than the great Charles Bronson (another favorite actor of mine) in a very early role as one of Jarrod's assistants. The film is extremely creepy at times, and visually stunning throughout. A great photography goes in hand with excellent settings, especially the colorful and uncanny Wax Museum is masterly made. "House Of Wax", which was released in 2D, as well as with 3D effects, is a remake of Michael Curtiz' "Mystery of The Wax Museum". While this film does, in my opinion, not reach the brilliance of later masterpieces with Vincent Price (such as "The Pit And The Pendulum", "The Haunted Palace", "The Masque Of The Red Death" or "Witchfinder General"), it is definitely a great and highly atmospheric Horror film, and an immensely influential one. The mere fact that this is the film that rose the great Vincent Price to stardom makes it an absolute must-see, and what a stunning film it is! All said, "House Of Wax" is a great Horror film that comes with my highest recommendations!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy yet fun 1950's classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen both 1933's "Mystery of the Wax Museum" starring Lionel Atwill as the insane, burned sculptor and also the 1953 remake "House of Wax", starring the late, great Vincent Price as the mad genius, Professor Henry Jarrod.I think both movies are wonderful in their own way. Price put his indelible stamp on the character, as only he could. One can't help but feel not only horror but pity for his character. Phyliss Kirk is great in her role as Sue, the young woman who has the misfortune to resemble Professor Jarrod's greatest masterpiece, Marie Antoinette, which was burned in the fire that disfigures him. He becomes obsessed with recreating his greatest sculpture, and using Sue's body to help recreate his masterpiece.I think the scene where the disfigured monster is chasing Sue through the foggy London streets is one the creepiest scenes in 1950's cinema.Vincent Price was just a great actor in every role he was in, and this movie is no exception. He is supported by Charles Bronson in one of his earliest movie roles as a deaf and mute assistant, who is creepy in his own right. Watch also for an appearance by Carolyn Jones, who went on to t.v. history portraying Morticia in the Addams Family. She has a small but pivotal role as Cathy, a friend of Sue who get's murdered early in the movie. This movie is everything a good classic horror movie should be!</fullReview>

I didn't even knew that was Charles Bronson the first time I saw it when I was a kid. It was creepy, it was scary. It had cheesy 3-D effects, but hey, what's perfect. It was kind of slow at points, but with a blending of horror and film noir. This is a masterpiece and if you are fan of Vincent Price and you haven't seen this one yet, then watch it. The effects are great, the acting is great, the spooky atmosphere is great, it's an almost perfect movie. De Toth does a great job as a director. I am amazed how cool and realistic the make up effects are considering how old the movie is, 8 STARS.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Brilliant new take on the story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year of 1952 is widely considered as the beginning of the so-called "Golden Age" of 3-D film-making, as it was during that year when "Bwana Devil", the first color stereoscopic feature in 3-D was released. The enormous success of this new way of achieving 3-D prompted Warner Bros. Pictures to prepare a similar movie to compete. So, 20 years after the release of Michael Curtiz' Technicolor thriller, "Mystery of the Wax Museum", Warner Brothers Pictures decided to make a brand new version of the movie using the new 3-D technology that was just beginning to be very popular. Titled "House of Wax" and directed by André De Toth, the movie would not only become the most successful 3-D movie of its day, but also the first one with stereophonic sound and, probably its most important achievement, the film that would introduce the legendary Vincent Price to the Horror genre.The plot follows very closely the original's storyline, although of course, with several important changes. Prof. Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is an unnaturally talented sculptor, whose wax figures are of an amazing beauty and realism. However, his refusal to make sensational exhibits to attract more people to his Wax Museum enrage his financial partner Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts), so Burke decides to burn the place with Jarrod inside in order to collect the insurance money. Months later, it is discovered that Prof. Jarrod survived, albeit badly hurt and with his hands and legs useless, but with the intention of reopening his "House of Wax" with the aid of a deaf mute student named Igor (Charles Bronson). At the museum's opening, a young woman named Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) makes a shocking discovery: the figure representing Joan of Arc looks extremely like her best friend Cathy (Carolyn Jones), who was just recently murdered by a mysterious stranger!Written by Crane Wilbur, the plot is essentially the same as it is also based on Charles Belden's play, but unlike the play and the original movie, Wilbur chooses to focus on the horror element of the story, transforming the whole tale of mystery into a classic Gothic story, almost in the style of Universal's horror films of the 30s (the movie is set in that decade). The real main change is that this time there is no mystery about who is committing the murders, but by putting the film's villain under the spotlight, Wilbur really enhances the suspense, drama and darkness of the story; and since the mystery is no longer a subject of importance in the story, the characters and their relationships become a bit more developed as they form the center of the story, allowing the actors (specially Vincent Price) to showcase their talents.Director André De Toth was probably the best suited to adapt Crane Wilbur's script to the screen, as he was already renowned by his psychological take on his films noir and westerns during the 40s. De Toth's take on the script is elegant and classy, yet with an ominous Gothic atmosphere very much in tone with the focus on horror that Wilbur gave to the script. With lavish set designs and an excellent use of color that probably inspired the British Hammer films, De Toth creates a beautiful film to look at with his usual brilliant use of cinematography (by Bert Glennon and J. Peverell Marley) that even without the 3-D effect looks wonderful. His use of 3-D is notable in its originality and most importantly, on its subtlety (only two or three moments are obvious campy gimmicks), so while the movie loses some of its impact on TV, it's still a powerful image to look at.The cast is one of the film's best features, starting with Vincent Price, who after this movie his career would take him to become an icon of the horror genre. In the role previously played by Lionel Atwill, Price creates a far more sympathetic character, as his unusual charm, screen presence and ease of word simply take over the screen and make the character very likable, despite having such a dark past. Phyllis Kirk has a character meant to replace the reporter of the original story as our main character. While the character is transformed from determined adventurer to damsel in distress, Kirk's performance makes her very sensible and real, and far less weak and passive than could had been. A young Carolyn Jones appears as Sue's friend Cathy Gray, and despite having short scenes she showcases her great beauty and promising talent in a wonderful way."House of Wax" is truly a classic of the genre and, while I wouldn't say it's a complete improvement over Michael Curtiz' original, it's certainly offers a way different experience due to its more horror-oriented plot. Sadly, the film loses a lot of its impact without the 3-D technology, as it leaves some of the most notorious 3-D scenes (particularly near the intermission) as obvious gimmicks that serve to no purpose other than to showcase how good the 3-D visuals look. I'm sure than on a 3-D projection the same scenes are wonderful, but without the technology, they really lose their magic. Despite that tragedy, the film holds up very well, thanks in part to De Toth wise choice of limiting the most obvious 3-D to only certain scenes, so it's not completely bothersome at all.A definitive must-see for horror fans, "House of Wax" may not feel the same without the 3-D visuals, but it still is an influential film with superb direction, wonderful visuals and overall, an excellent cast. Both this and the original 30s film make an excellent double-bill, as one can discover the excellent results of remakes done right. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful classic-wax figures or are they- and the Vincent Price.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House of wax is truly an amazing film which i never get tired of, the film has great timing, a great story line and Vincent Price makes the film what it is without a doubt. I love how price looks at all of his creations burning and his facial expressions were just genius. House of wax(1953) to me beats the 1933 and 2005 versions by a long run- For a start the 1933 mystery of the wax museum lacks in depth of the characters and their performances leave room for improvement. Lional Atwill's character does'nt really say that many great memorial lines and actually seems grumpy throughout most of the film which is interesting. In addition, it is also hard to tell what is happening at times such as what is being said by the reporter-u need to watch the film with sub titles(mixed up). However, I did enjoy some aspects of 'Mystery' and I found 'Mystery' more creepy than House of wax(1953). The 2005 house of wax is like a Texas chainsaw flick which does'nt focus on the sculptors and how the try to create beauty, although i actually still enjoyed it, as it was a good horror film.House of wax was the first movie I had ever seen with Vincent Price and shortly after watching house of wax I bought eight more DVDs starring him,now that says something. I now have 20. I think that any film with Price in it makes that film memorable, house of wax is only one of my favorites with Price because he seems so fresh and he gives the camera 100% at all times and how he conveys how his character is intent with creating beauty any way he can. I look the contrast between Jared (Price) at the start of the film to how he is after the fire. Marie Antoniette is an interesting icon in the film as well the actors Charles Bronson the wide eyed Physis Kirk and things such as how Price's character changes from creating beauty to making a chamber of Horrors.Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price in good remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like fellow Hungarian Michael Curtiz twenty years earlier, Andre De Toth also tackled Charles Bledden's stage play The Wax Works. His treatment differed from the 1933 version in emphasizing horror rather than mystery. The legendary Vincent Price plays Professor Henry Jarrod, a master wax sculptor whose studio is burnt down by his greedy business partner to collect the insurance money. Vincent Price is excellent as usual and of course his presence can only add to the film. The script is more lucid and in fact the complaint that there is no mystery left is correct, but that is the way it was intended.The Technicolor photography is good but certainly not as unique as those of the once lost masterpiece, Mystery of the Wax Museum. The same is true for the sets (at least the early London portion). There is a small role for a deaf mute played by one Charles Buchinsky, who later changed his surname to Bronson. He is virtually unrecognizable in this early role. In comparing House of Wax and Mystery of the Wax Museum, I would say House of Wax has a better script and star-performer in Vincent Price but Mystery has a more beautiful visual look and the 'scream queen' of the 30's Fay Wray as Jarrod's Marie Antoinette.</fullReview>

The mannequins in his museums are so realistic, they would actually come to life. As they say. I had a hard time believing it myself. However, these mannequins are actually victims. The artist first kills his victims then coats them in wax. That is crazy! Charles Bronson plays Igor in the movie. He's built like a bear, but he kinds of reminds me of Igor in the old Frakenstein movies, without the sick freakish look. The latest victim showed a bit of skin when he almost got coated, the gentleman covers her up. That is nice. At least the movie didn't go far. Vincent Price is great at his work, the never let up, or let the movie goer down, and the adventure factor remained in tact throughout it all. This is a must have, and a serious keeper. Mark my word, anything with Vincent Price is a gem! 5 Stars!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price Classic: House Of Wax</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House Of Wax (1953): Starring Vincent Price, Frank Lovejoy, Carolyn Jones, Charles Bronson, Phyllis Kirk, Roy Roberts, Paul Picerni, Angela Clarke, Dabbs Greer, Paul Cavanaugh, Oliver Blake, Reggie Rymal, Leo Curley, Joanne Brown, Frank Ferguson, Darwin Greenfield, Mary Lou Holloway, Jack Kenny, Lyle Latell, Richard Lightner, Terry Mitchell, Jack Mower, Eddie Parks, Riza Royce, Phillip Tonge, Merry Townsend, Ruth Warren, Grace Lee Whitney, Nedrick Young....Director Andre De Toth..Screenplay Charles Belden and Crane Wilbur.Audiences in 1953 were drawn away from their new TV sets to the movie theaters to watch all sorts of films, ranging from historical epics, romance, comedy, drama, science fiction/alien invasion and another beloved genre- horror. In the horror film department, no name was bigger than Vincent Price. With "House Of Wax", directed by Andre De Toth, Vincent Price's career was escalating to a newer level. This film was unique in that it was tailor-made for the new 3-D movies, which meant audiences put on glasses that enhanced their viewing experience to the point it felt as if they were inside the film themselves. The cinematography by Bert Glennon and J. Peverell Marley is supremely haunting, dark and intimidating. Visual effects (the 3-D ones) are by Julian Gunzburg and the excellent sound by Charles Lang, who employed the greatest of collection of frightening, haunting noises. The premise: A brilliant but misunderstood Professor, Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) establishes a wax museum but his life-like statues are too disturbing and grotesque for the tastes of the spectators. A supposed "friend" Lt. Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) scams him and sets fire to his wax museum to collect insurance money. During the physical altercation between them, Professor Henry is burned beyond recognition in the flames. Years later, he re-appears looking very different and opens a new wax museum which, unlike his first one, offers life-like models of historic figures or famous people, sort of like Maddame Tussaud's Celebrity Wax Museum. But this is really the Professor's revenge. Before long, several gruesome murders are reported. The Professor's models for the sculptures are in fact his victims, killed and then turned into wax. When he finally sets his eyes on the wife of the man who wronged him (played by Carolyn Jones, later famous for her role as Morticia Addams in the 60's sitcom "The Addams Family"), the two friends will meet up again and this time the confrontation will be more visceral. Look for a young Charles Bronson in a small role. This film is wonderfully written and haunting, without resorting to blood and gore, even though there are some moments of physical horror (murder) but it's tame by today's standards. Vincent Price as the vindictive Professor is superb, and many fans and critics consider this role to be his best. Unlike today's pointlessly violent and nasty horror films, this one has a powerful theme: that of man's desire for revenge and its consequences. We can almost sympathize with Professor Henry's struggles and he does appear to have a valid reason for revenge. It is of course, a film that poses the question: would we go as far as the Professor does for justice ? Clearly, this film analyzes the dark side in all of us. Enjoy this classic horror flick for Halloween! Note: This original version far surpasses the re-make (2004) which is nothing more than a blood-and-gore-fest and not nearly as intelligent and thought-provoking as this Vincent Price classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once a classic, always a classic, I suppose, but watching this without the benefit of the cute tricks of 3D, this comes over more than a little flat. There is plenty that is good to look at and the pacing is OK but the script seems particularly poor, jokey when it shouldn't be and rather clichéd. Of course talking cliché is difficult when the film clearly influenced others and it may be unfair to jump on this one but there are some wince making moments. Price does well but already there are instances of his verging between flat and camp. Still, it must have seems fun at the time, certainly I remember enjoying it on the big screen in 3D, and if it seems to drag a little now and we get to see the same waxworks one two many times we have to be fair to the time. This was a great success, it launched Price and is still worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Price Wins First Prize</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have always thought that 1953 "House of Wax" is a little classic in horror movies.The story goes that soft mannered wax figures artist Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) owns a wax museum along with his ambitious and strictly commercial partner Mathew Burke (Roy Roberts). Jarrod is always searching for beauty in his work. When business go down, Burke decides to burn the place and collect the insurance amount. Jarrod gets caught in the fire and is assumed dead. Some time later he reappears in a wheel chair and starts in the same business again but his work has changed radically; his figures now represent killers, torture and incredibly realistic pictures of actual murders (Burke's is one of them) that shock the city by the time. Scott Andrews (Paul Picerni) is interested in learning wax work and Jarrod takes him as his disciple mainly because he is somehow attracted to the man's girlfriend Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk). As you can imagine, Jarrod's new museum hides a terrible secret that is fully revealed in the very exciting final sequence."House of Wax" is surely not-very-talented director Andre de Toth's best work ever. There's no doubt either that the film relies on an original script (remember it was 1953), excellent sordid settings and mainly for Price's work. He clearly overacts as he always did in horror films, but no other actor could overact like Price and he knew perfectly that audiences went to see his overacting and enjoyed it very much.There are also acceptable performances by Frank Lovejoy in one of his many police detective roles, Phyllis Kirk as the damsel in distress and talented Carolyn Jones as a classic dumb blonde. On the other hand, Paul Picerni lacks the needed charm for the good guy and his acting doesn't add much. Charles Bronson is around as Price's menacing sidekick long before "Death Wish" put him into an acceptable film carrier.If you consider -and you can't do otherwise- that "House of Wax" was released more than 50 years ago you'll have to agree it is an excellent movie in the horror genre and even a classic in it.Don't miss it if you missed it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 3D Film Expo just screened this film tonight. I've seen it dozens of times,but never like this. It's a whole different film when you see it in Real 3D,not the red and green kind. I see now why it's the most popular of all the 3D films made.It's great,and really holds up over these 53 years as a fun film to sit through. The opening bit of the second part of the film has this guy hitting ping-pong balls at you(I ducked twice). It is just the very best!I have watched this film for years on TV and have the DVD release of it,but nothing comes close to seeing it on the big screen in fantastic restored color and the best 3D effects ever done. Again a big Bravo to Sabucat Productions and Warner Brothers for letting a whole new generation of film goers enjoy this classic piece of film again. Thank you, Thank you,Thank you</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reacquainted with a favorite horror flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was happy to be reacquainted with one of my all-time favorite Vincent Price horror movies that I loved as a kid growing up in the sixties. As I watched "House of Wax" for the first time in a very long time it was great to see why Price was one of the greatest actors in the horror genre. The "House of Wax" disc I just hired also had the 1933 "Mystery of the Wax Museum" on the flip side. It was very good, especially for the technology of the day. However, I prefer the "House of Wax" mainly because of my admiration of Vincent Price, the work he's done in the horror genre, and the advances is film technology (the introduction of 3-D technique). One of the great things I always liked about Vincent Price's characters that he played and the type of films he worked in, always made you sympathetic to the character's plight. The violence, 'gore' and the end result of the actions taken by the character or that were done to a potential victim, were usually implied. This differs with many of the horror/slasher/gore films of the present. In the classic 50's films you know that no one's really getting killed/slashed/maimed for life. Present day films often blur the line between reality and fiction. In the classic films of the 30's-50's the 'villain', whether you could sympathize with his/her actions or they were just plain evil are generally defeated and the innocent victims are rescued. Call me a traditionalist, moralist, or whatever, but I like for there to be fairly clear lines of 'good winning over evil' rather than what is seen in many horror films today. Current films are mostly filled with gratuitous violence just for the sake of the shock factor not to mention the motive of making money.In "House of Wax" I also was fascinated by the work of another actor who would become known in films of the 70's and 80's as an archetypal hero in the "Death Wish" series. I just found out that he's billed in "House of Wax" as Charles Buchinsky but is better known to millions of fans as Charles Bronson. Those familiar with the "Death Wish" series, know that he fits this character role perfectly. This series, although different in many respects, still has the theme of justice and good triumphing over injustice and evil.I'm glad that I was able to see "House of Wax" once more. It's too bad that Vincent Price or someone like him isn't around to provide harmless 'chills and thrills'. Thank you Mr. Price. I sure miss you and the kind of films you made that provided entertainment to a kid who loved to be scared out of his skull but knew he'd wake up the next morning with his skin still intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the few things that I really didn't like about the wax film that preceded this one, The Mystery of the House of Wax, was the way Ivan Igor's partner rushed to burn down the museum minutes after an art critic informed Igor that he was going to make his work famous and him a rich man, because he had just received this immense news and then his aggravated partner walked in seconds later and burned the place down for the insurance money. It was just so hard to accept that Igor's partner moved so fast that he was simply unable to utter a word about what new events had so recently transpired. In this film, Ivan Igor is played by Professor Henry Jarrod who is played by Vincent Price, and his partner is in full earshot when he hears the news that an art critic may want to buy into the project and free his own investment for whatever else he has in mind. Other events lead to him being unable to accept the offer, and the idea of cashing in on the insurance money remains on the table without the need for any fast talking or lack of an opportunity to get a word in edgewise about impending success in order for it to come about. Quite a nice little wrinkle that has been ironed out there, I should think.This does, however, render the overzealous investor into more of a villain than he was in the original film, especially when he carelessly tosses kerosene onto Jarrod as he is walking around dousing the sculptures to make them burn faster. It's possible that he is meant to have thought Jarrod was just another realistic statue, but he had to have known that he was still in there when he went around blowing out candles to cause a build-up of gas in the building. Evidently he didn't feel like sharing that insurance money!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What I liked about this movie was the story in general. it was very good and had a few twists and turns that you don't normally have in many "scary" movies. Phylis Kirk did a nice job as the heroine of the film, and the police and boyfriend actually listen to what she suspects. The film of course belongs to Vincent Price. His character at the beginning of the film is eccentric but not murderous as he later becomes. The "creature" is quite bizarre and yes, kinda scary. The sets and the Technicolor only enhance this film to help make it a perfect example of 1950's horror films. There were a few silly scenes that should have been left on the cutting room floor, such as the three girls going through the wax museum, otherwise it's a fun romp.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>eccentric, creepy precursor to Hammer horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most striking things about "House of Wax" is how uncannily it resembles the early outings of Hammer Studios (whose films were subsequently distributed by Warner Bros., as well)--period setting, fantastic production design, and a generally old-fashioned approach to horror; even today, it is brilliant to watch for aesthetic purposes alone. While lacking Hammer's dynamic duo of Cushing and Lee, we are given something just as good: Vincent Price, the loopy curator of a wax museum, who is supposedly torched in a fire as his business associate wants to collect the insurance money; later, Price re-emerges with a revived museum exhibiting scenes of historical violence. Andre de Toth's directorial style clearly had an influence on the likes of Hammer veterans Terence Fisher and Freddie Francis, but it is Price's compelling, darkly humorous performance that lies at the center of this "House." Without him, it would easily lose its well-sculpted edge. (One major complaint: the inclusion of seemingly needless scenes of leg-kicking and paddle-ball-playing to exhibit the film's then-innovative "3-D" gimmick.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is There Anyone Who Doesn't Love This Movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is there even anyone who hasn't seen this movie? What? You're kidding! Well, alright, then; for the benefit of those 17 people in the entire world who haven't, I won't give anything away. Even those people must know the premise, though: eccentric artistic genius is driven mad when his wax museum is destroyed by an arson fire; opens new one where all the figures happen to resemble recently missing and/or deceased persons....hmmmm, do ya think it could be....? And who's that really awful lookin' guy who hobbles around in a black hat and cape, stealing corpses and terrorizing innocent young women?This (originally) 3-D remake of Mystery Of the Wax Museum ('33) actually improves on the original which, enjoyable as it is, suffers from some unnecessary storyline clutter and lack of focus. Here, the plot is boiled down to its basic elements, and the transposition of the story to the turn of the (20th) century better suits the eerie goings-on than the modern-day (at the time) setting of the earlier version. This time period also allows the film to make some subtle but interesting commentary on the place of women at the close of the Victorian era.Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) the "nice" girl whose uncanny resemblance to a now-destroyed figure of Marie Antoinette puts her in danger, is called upon to perform the requisite screaming and fainting required of a heroine in jeopardy, but she's also rather clever and spunky. She happens to room with Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones) who, though not really a "loose" woman, has been around a bit and is something of a golddigger. This is a slight twist on the Fay Wray (nice girl)-Glenda Farrell (wisecracking dame) relationship in the original, where the nice girl character was really secondary. Sue is innocent enough to be scandalized by the can-can dancers in a beer hall ("Do nice people come here?") and Cathy's matter-of-fact talk about her dealings with, and feelings about, men. Still, she's the one who's smart enough to figure out the terrible secret of the wax museum, before engaging in a gutsy confrontation with the baddies.One of the film's wry observations occurs during a scene in which Cathy dresses for a date while dispensing to Sue some blunt advice on handling men; all the while she's donning a half-dozen layers of undergarments - slips, stays, corsets and who-knows-what-all - and when she's fully dressed - completely covered from chin to foot - says "If I don't sizzle 'im tonight, I may as well give up!" While her attitudes are rather daring for those days, her garb demonstrates - symbolically and literally - how women were "restrained" by the times in which they were living.Along with Kirk and Jones, the rest of the cast is first-rate: Frank Lovejoy and Dabbs Greer (wonderfully dry and understated) as the detectives on the case(s), Charles Buchinsky (later known as Bronson) as a mute henchman, Roy Roberts as the slimy arsonist and Paul Picerni as the nominal hero (who's at least a bit more useful than his counterpart in the original).Saved for last, and by no means least, the incomparable Vincent Price, giving one of his definitive performances as the alternately sensitive, droll and ruthless proprietor of the wax museum. His patter during the guided tour of the newly-opened museum is priceless (did I just say that?), and toward the climactic moments, his reading of the simple line, "You shouldn't have done that, my dear" invests it with menace that can send chills down your spine. What with the carnival atmosphere generated by some of the set-pieces obviously placed there solely for the 3-D effect (the can-can dancers; the paddle-ball barker), there is a good deal of levity between "scary" moments, and our Vinnie knows exactly when to plant tongue firmly in cheek. Price had always been a reliable and versatile performer; witness the slow-witted, drunken duke in Tower of London; Shelby, the charming ne'er-do-well in Laura; the tortured, drug-addled husband in Dragonwyck; the autocratic executive in Champagne For Caesar; the at once egocentric and self-deprecating movie star in His Kind Of Woman. Though he would regularly break away from the horror genre for the rest of his life, the success of this picture, for better or worse, played a large part in determining the second half of Price's career trajectory. It also helped define his place in film history as, I daresay, one of the most beloved and fondly remembered actors of the 20th century.Being one of the best of the 3-D bunch (both artistically and technically) makes seeing HOUSE OF WAX in that format a real treat. Unboubtedly, the technical hurdles involved in perfecting a 3-D process for home video (in whatever form) will be overcome, and we can hope sooner rather than later. Nevertheless, little is added but novelty, and the film stands quite well on its 2-D merits. Remakes are almost always inferior to the originals that inspired them. This is one happy case where the opposite is true, making HOUSE OF WAX, all things considered, a rare delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Understandably the most popular 3-D movie to come from the 1950s, this wonderfully Gothic horror film is worth watching, even without the extra depth dimension. Vincent Price is marvelous as the sensitive artist-turned mad sculptor who closely guards his Chamber of Horrors, and chases around poor Phyllis Kirk, trying to recreate his beloved Marie Antoinette statue. Kirk is terrific in this, probably her best role. Carolyn Jones is a hoot as her ditzy friend. Paul Picerni is not half-bad as the boyfriend, and Charles Bronson is pretty funny, if nothing else, as the mute assistant to Price. There's plenty of fog and shadows, not to mention one pretty wild paddle-ball, all put together, for a very satisfying and fun movie. It's easy to see why this was such a hit in its time, and it remains today, not only one of the best 3-D films ever, but also one of the best horror films to come from its era. See it in 3-D, if you can, but by all means, see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>3D or 2D, it still packs a punch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see this film in its initial release, at the Chicago Theatre (in Chicago) one Saturday morning at 8:30. The soundtrack was stereo surround, which really aided the 3D effects on-screen. I think at that hour of the morning, there were perhaps 12 of us in the theatre, so the fight scene with Roy Roberts and Vinnie was even more heightened, when Roy threw the chair at Vinnie, and we heard it land behind us. Wow!!It is interesting to note that director Andre De Toth had only one eye -- which made him the butt of several jokes at the time; that is, until the movie actually came out. One way you can get the 3D effect when viewing this film on TV is merely to close one eye. The lighting is so set as to enhance the 3D effect throughout the film. This film (a remake of "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" [1933]) is much better because it takes place in a time past, and is not contemporary, which would date it badly. This film is worth watching time and again, and while perhaps not quite a classic, I would give it a big ***1/2. It is available from Warner Home Video on a DVD with "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" so you can compare the films.</fullReview>

Andre de Toth, who only hadone eye, was a champion of the process and wrote theoreticallyabout the use of the process to tell a story, and you can see histheories put in to practice in the way he stages and shoots hissequences, his use of back, middle and foreground, and his useof camera pivots and dollies. In fact, the most effective 3-D work,comes not in tossing things into the camera (although he doesthat, minimally), but rather in the chase scene with Price and Kirkthrough the fog-shrouded streets of old New York.

This film was one of the great B-horror movies because it has all the basic elements including the screamer woman. I can't remember where I picked up this love for Vincent Price movies, but I do remember renting this one for the first time (imagine the surprise on the video store clerk's face when this sweet little 9 year old girl brought an obscure horror movie to his counter). It's always been one of my favorites of Price's. Just the first walk through the museum's chamber of horrors is a great scene. There's a group of women who are growing weaker with every famous horrific scene on display until one of them finally faints and Vincent Price just causally reaches into his coat. He holds out a little bottle to the women and offers, "Smelling salts?" in a manner that suggests that it was not the first time someone had fainted in his museum. How is that not classic?</fullReview>

Basically Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) a an artist devoted to creating lifelike wax figure sculptures of historical figures in famous scenes, including John Wilkes Booth assassinating Abraham Lincoln, Joan of Arc burning at the stake, and his most beloved Marie Antoinette. Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts), his business partner, suggests a waxwork chamber of horrors should be created to draw in more visitors and get a return on his investment, but Jarrod refuses, so Burke goes mad and sets the place on fire, this would mean he could collect the insurance, all the beautiful works are destroyed and Jarrod is trapped inside when it explodes. Eighteen years later Jarrod unexpectedly reappears, opening a new waxworks exhibit, the House of Wax, where with the help of his deaf and mute assistant Igor (Charles Buchinsky, better known as Charles Bronson) he has recreated most of his former figures, but he has concentrated much more on macabre. The museum includes the popular "Chamber of Horrors", which displays many notable crimes of history, including more recent ones, such as the death of his former business partner Burke, who was found hanged, this was done by a hideous cloaked and facially disfigured killer. Burke's fiancée Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones) is also murdered, and when her friend Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) visits the House of Wax she is intrigued by how realistic all the figures look, but also some of their faces may seem familiar, including Joan of Arc who looks exactly like Cathy, the Professor says he just borrowed her likeness from the newspaper report photograph, and he is yet to find the face of his beloved Marie Antoinette. Jarrod finds Sue Allen beautiful with the perfect face for Marie Antoinette, he asks her if she could pose, she agrees, but later wandering further into the museum she discovers the horrifying truth, all the waxworks are real bodies coated in wax, and Jarrod is the disfigured murderer who suffered severe burns those many months ago, but in the end he is defeated falling into the vat of scolding wax. Also starring Frank Lovejoy as Lt. Tom Brennan, Paul Picerni as Scott Andrews, Angela Clarke as Mrs. Andrews, Paul Cavanagh as Sidney Wallace and Dabbs Greer as Sgt. Jim Shane. Price is great being charming, but of course he is even better being secretly evil and looking hideous under the dark get-up, and then little known Bronson is creepy as the silent servant, it is an engaging scary story about revenge and madness, the Gothic feel is great, and without the gimmick used you can recognise things popping out at the you for the 3D version (which made a lot of money at the time), a fantastic period horror film. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price fans can't afford to miss this one! (small spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although he already starred in a few lesser successful horror films before (like for example the sequel to 'The Invisible Man' or 'Tower of London') THIS is the film that typed Vincent Price as an immortal horror-icon. And, boy was he ever born to portray the deranged curator (Henry Jarrod) of the wax museum. Yet, he once was a dedicated artist with noble goals but his previous partner set the atelier on fire in order to collect the insurance money. Jarrod lost all of his sculptures (even his personal masterwork) and got severely mutilated himself. Long after, he triumphs again with the re-opening of his museum but a local girl becomes suspicious when she recognizes the face of her murdered roommate in the wax version of Joan of Arc. Lt. of police Brennan (Frank Lovejoy) also begins to distrust Jarrod when noticing the strange resemblances between wax sculptures and bodies that went missing in the morgue?House of Wax supposedly is an almost word-for-word remake of Michael Curtiz's 'Mystery of the Wax Museum', shot in 1933. Unfortunately, I haven't seen that version so I can't say whether this is better or not. Although I highly doubt this film can be topped when it comes to atmosphere, acting and thrills. House of Wax is stylishly directed by André de Toth and contains several classic horror sequences. The fire in the atelier (with quirky 3-D gimmicks) is terrifically grotesque and the sequence in which Phyllis Kirk is chased through the modestly lit streets by a cloaked figure is downright astonishing. Also, the nightly shots inside the wax museum will unquestionably cause scares among many viewers. Vincent Price is simply excellent in his role but this film features another remarkable performer. The mute, primitive assistant of Prof. Jarrod - Igor ? is played by a very young Charles Bronson. This was one of his first credited roles and he looks so different than as we're used to seeing him, it almost is difficult to recognize him. The whole premise of eerie wax statues is excellent horror material and aside from this film ? which is easily the best I ever saw ? I also recommend 'Nightmare in Wax', 'Terror in the Wax Museum', 'Waxwork' and the Italian 'Maschera di Cera'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the best horror film starring Vincent Price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of the movie Mystery of the Wax Museum--a decent, though dated thriller. This is one of these cases where the remake is simply a much better film. Don't be fooled by the fact this was originally a 3-D film--unlike most 3-D films, it's an excellent film on its own right and doesn't rely on goofy 3-D action scenes.Vincent Price is the at first sympathetic monster who creates beautiful works of art by covering DEAD PEOPLE in wax. It seemed that since his disfiguring accident, he no longer has the skills to create them from scratch. However, it does NOT prevent him from leaving his wheelchair to commit the murders of people he wished to coat in wax. The VERY BEST of these murders is the well-deserved murder of the man who was responsible for Price's disfigurement. He puts a noose around this man's neck and throws him down an elevator shaft!! It's spectacular to say the least! Full of chills as well as a good plot, this is perhaps the best horror film of the 1950s.</fullReview>

I guess that is a large part of the appeal of House Of Wax to me.But more importantly than that, the grand energy charged music in the opening part of the movie, during the fire scene. That is what I remember about House Of Wax. The music captures the disaster and tragedy of the moment so perfectly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best of the 3D horror films is a masterpiece of old-fashioned terror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike so many other horror films of the period, HOUSE OF WAX spares no time in cutting to the action. Ten minutes into the film and you have a terrific fight in a burning building, which traditionally doesn't happen till the end of a film like this. The speedy pace of the film is just one of the many, many factors in its favour, and works so that it is never boring.HOUSE OF WAX is essentially a remake of the 1933 classic, MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM, given a fresh breath of life by the advent of the 3D craze of the early '50s, enlivened by films such as CREATURE FROM THE BLACK LAGOON. And indeed, there are many moments in the film where the 3D process works wonderfully; in fight scenes, things fly towards the screen, and the standout moment comes when a man playing some balls-on-elastic game knocks them repeatedly towards the camera, which must have been quite startling to an audience at that time.Along with the camera trickery, HOUSE OF WAX boasts an impressive performance from a youngish Vincent Price, in a role which helped to make his name synonymous with the horror genre. He would appear in countless flicks later on in the '50s, like THE FLY, THE TINGLER, and THE HOUSE ON HAUNTED HILL. He's perfectly cast as the silky-voiced proprietor of the wax museum, caring for his creations as if they were alive, but becoming a scarred maniac after a fire destroys them all (and there is a certain element of sympathy to be had with Price too; after all, he's been hideously crippled in a fire and his life's work has been destroyed - how would you react?).Price is supported by a fleshed out, capable cast of screaming heroines and butch heroes, the usual bunch you expect from these sort of films. Down in the cast list is also a young Charles Buchinsky, better known these days as Charles Bronson, who went on to star in loads of crime thrillers in the '70s like DEATH WISH. HOUSE OF WAX seems strangely old-fashioned when placed with other atomic monsters and sci-fi flicks which filled cinemas at the time, from INVADERS FROM MARS to WAR OF THE WORLDS and more. The genteel type of horror - crimes are hinted at but never shown explicitly - gives the film a certain kind of charm, and you can't help but think that those who die deserved it anyway (especially the incredibly annoying blonde haired woman who later starred as Morticia in THE ADDAMS FAMILY!).However, the lavish sets and costumes, good special effects (Price's makeup is certainly memorable), melodramatic music, and exciting fight scenes which literally burst to life on screen, helped in no small measure by the 3D process, make the film a very enjoyable watch. Two classic horror images also come from the film - a scarred Price hunting the streets in his fedora and cape; and the scenes showing wax models slowly melting, their eyes popping out and heads dropping. HOUSE OF WAX is definitely a minor classic of the genre, and a lot of fun for nostalgia buffs and Price fans alike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A horror classic.A wax sculptor's wax museum is burned down by his business partner, with him inside. He survives and sets about creating a new wax museum, only with much more macabre scenes. Plus, his wax figures may be more based on actual humans than people think...Intriguing, thrilling drama. Plot is engaging and quite solid, especially for a horror movie. Good set up with a good progression of tension, all with a decent air of mystery to the events. Stars Vincent Price in one of his earlier horror roles. This movie may well have been the one that set him up as the horror actor of the era. He certainly delivers a perfectly sinister yet restrained performance.Good support from Phyllis Kirk, Frank Lovejoy and Paul Picerni.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"A man has to be a little nuts to be a good showman."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had a brief 'huh?' moment when that carnival barker (Reggie Rymal) showed up for the opening of the House of Wax Museum. It was only after I read a few of the reviews here that I learned this was originally a 3D film and those paddle ball blasts would have been a real highlight for movie goers of the era. Otherwise the guy's appearance was almost as out of place as that 'Intermission' sequence that might have lasted about ten seconds, requiring one to actually hit the pause button to get a cup of coffee.It's been a while since I've seen Lionel Atwill in the 1933 version of this film, "Mystery of the Wax Museum". Both share a similar story line and choosing the better of the two is probably a matter of personal preference. I like both Atwill and Vincent Price so for me it's a toss up. However Price's first appearance in the picture as the figure in black was almost comical to me, limping along like some deranged Zorro. He even had two accomplices dressed exactly the same way when he stole the body of Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones) from the city morgue.I guess it's no big thing, but if you're paying attention you probably question as I did how the crippled Jarrod wasn't able to stay in character with his disability as time went on. When he made Matthew Burke his first victim and went chasing Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk) through the city streets at night he was hobbling along with his deformed foot at an awkward angle, but by the time he's fighting off the cops at the finale, he's running up stairs with the agility of an athlete.The biggest surprise for me in this picture was seeing Charles Bronson show up as Henry Jarrod's (Price) assistant at the wax museum. He was still using his real name Buchinsky at the time but depending on the movie or TV credit, it was spelled differently, making me wonder if that was intended or just a matter of getting his name spelled wrong by film makers. Some of his credits even list him as 'Chas' as his name showed up in the credits for a Roy Rogers TV episode back in the Fifties.Well aside from all that, Vincent Price fans ought to have a pretty good time with this one. This was the film that launched his eventual status as a horror film icon, making me an instant fan as a kid with the likes of "The Fly" and "House on Haunted Hill" in the late Fifties. He had that great voice and terrific presence as an actor, ranking him right up there with the other greats like Karloff and Chaney.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent introduction to the genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Attempting to start his career over, a wax sculptor returns several years away to use a group of low-lifes around him to be the models for his next display and forces an inspector and his girlfriend to stay on top of him to halt the madman's rampage.This is a prime slab of early classic horror that is extremely interesting and packs a couple more thrills than it should for its time. With this one single film, we are introduced to the wondrous Vincent Price as a horror icon, and this is one assured debut. Price is in top form here, and the fact that we can see his work for the first time in a horror film makes this one an extra special film. Even without that recognition, it's an entertaining 50's cheese-fest that features a lot of great moments. The beginning of the film is one of the film's best features, as a fire destroys a wax studio in a nice action set-piece that normally doesn't have these big scenes in movies and it's a wonderful, eye-opening first sequence. There is also a long and extended chase scene through the dank, fog-laden streets of London that really drives home some suspenseful moments. The murders are cool and violent for the time being while not overly stepping over any bounds of decency in place then. The other chase sequences are just as striking, with the last one being the top one in the film. That leads up to a spectacular conclusion that is so incredibly action-packed here with plenty of full- on struggling and brawling around in the wax lair that's fun on its own even before the utterly spectacular fire that spreads throughout here leaving the entire building in flames that makes the film all the more fun. The final revelation of Price's character is also one of the classic moments in the history of film, and it's just as shocking today as it was then. It gives some great chills, and the method used is pretty creative and unique. These here are all more than enough to hold this up over what is basically just one really lame and utterly bland flaw. Basically, most of the 3D sequences in here were pretty cheesy. That's not to say they didn't work in the film, just that they were pretty cheesy, easy-to-spot and not at all that convincingly done either. For the time, they might've worked but for the most part the gags haven't aged well. It's a toss-up as to which ones don't, but they're so noticeable and replayed throughout nearly every single 3D installment that they're not all that difficult to find faults with them. The only other small flaw is we saw the skin of Price's after burns much too early and often. It works wonderfully and has some fantastic abilities to shock, but too much is seen of it for it to be of much use in the scare department. It should've been hidden better to have an effect. Otherwise, for the film that introduced Vincent Price to the horror community it deserves some recognition.Today's Rating/PG: Violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remake that is at least as good as the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1953 version, unlike the 1933 version starring Glenda Farrell, is set in Victorian times. With the motion picture code in full force, you have nothing to lose by taking the story out of modern times. Again, the catalyst of the plot is an artist's greedy partner deciding to set fire to the wax museum that has become a real money loser and collect the insurance money. The artist (Vincent Price) wrestles with partner as he goes around setting fire to the place and ultimately is knocked unconscious, presumed dead by the greedy partner. He'd be wrong about that. I'm not spoiling anything here for you because this is revealed early on in the film.Here the protagonists in the film are an apprentice sculptor and his girlfriend. From the beginning they suspect something fishy is going on when the wax figure of Joan of Arc seems to bear an uncanny resemblance to our heroine's murdered roommate, played by Carolyn Jones, who was last seen saying she was going out with a wealthy debonair man she had just met, and then she just disappeared. Also, this version uses a gimmick that was popular with audiences of the 1950's - 3D. It was the two-strip technicolor of its day.The main attraction in this film is the charismatic Vincent Price. In the 40's he played a series of supporting roles in some noirish Fox films, and here he is just getting started in the horror genre. He breathes real life and brings range to the role of the mad murderous sculptor that Lionel Atwill didn't seem capable of delivering in the earlier version. Also, I like the fact that in this later version we actually get to see Price confront the former partner who left him to perish in his burning museum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vincent Price Flames Up</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a dark and rainy night in the 1890s, New York City wax sculptor Vincent Price (as Henry Jarrod) shows prospective investors his remarkably lifelike "House of Wax" figures. He hopes to sell part-ownership of his wax museum, but Mr. Price's partner won't wait for the potential sale. To collect a $25,000 insurance payoff, partner Roy Roberts (as Matthew Burke) sets fire to the wax museum. Price is furious, of course. His wax figures are destroyed in the meltdown. Even worse, Price is presumed to have gone up in flames. The star sculptor survives, of course. Later, Price turns up in a wheelchair. Because he can no longer sculpt, due to injuries sustained in the fire, Price hires some oddball assistants to help him recreate, "from the ground up," his burned-out "House of Wax"...This "3-D" remake of "Mystery of the Wax Museum" (1933) doesn't hold a candle to the original. But it's nothing to scoff at, either. Among the featured cast, it is interesting to see future box-office superstar Charles Bronson (aka "Igor" Buchinsky) playing Price's rough and muscular assistant. Also appearing is future "Addams Family" TV mother Carolyn Jones (as Cathy Gray), high-pitched and giggling in a waist-consuming corset. Obviously, the main asset is Vincent Price, a second-tier star dating back to the late 1930s. By the late 1950s, he had achieved top star status as the premiere horror film star in the country. Price remained a major feature film star through the 1970s, and was beloved thereafter. "House of Wax" is the prototype for Price's deliciously appealing mad professor persona.******* House of Wax (4/10/53) Andre De Toth ~ Vincent Price, Phyllis Kirk, Paul Picerni, Charles Bronson</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Predictable, Not Exciting as it was Meant to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise for House of Wax was interesting; if only it wasn't so bloated with visuals thrown in primarily to get in our face since it was released in 3-D. It's awesome that this was one of the earliest movies to be released in 3-D, but it reminded me of what I dislike about 3-D in this day and age.At the core of this film is somewhat of a "mystery," which focuses on the question who is the man with the disfigured face murdering people all over town. Any audience member would think it has to be the wax sculptor who is trapped in a burning museum at the beginning of the film - and they would be right.There's the spoiler in this review, but what I dislike about it is that it is really not much of a spoiler at all. We have a murderer running loose, setting up situations that are later redesigned at a wax museum by the main character who just so happens to return, only injured at the legs as far as we can tell. How many people around have a motivation for these murders? That's right, one.Even worse than this is the idea that visuals including a paddle ball, dancers putting their rears to the camera, and a fist punching above a face at us tries to get us focused on the 3-D, and has little relevance to making a good story. Also, it throws off its fast pace when there is an intermission to his 90 minute film due to the fact it was filmed with 3-D cameras.I don't much like this film, but it somewhat redeems itself for themes such as spectator-ship - the sculptor is obsessed with various women he recreates and marvels at their beauty - along with the motif of art vs reality - a friend of one of the murdered victims swears that the Joan of Arc sculptor must be that victim; it is too similar not to be.</fullReview>

Fortunately this remake has the always wonderful acting Vincent Price as the wax artist, a role which suits him well. The movie takes its time to build up, doesn't go at a high pace like the original. Things are explained a bit more, characters are more developed and visuals are also quite better than the original. I also thought it was more suspenseful. I prefer the 1890s setting of this movie while the original decided to take the story place in the time of that moment (which was the thirties). Still I'm aware that without the original we wouldn't have had this movie. One of the rare cases where I think a remake is better.

		<shortDescription>Hollywood's "Golden Era" melts into a . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . HOUSE OF WAX in perhaps the most ironic movie of all time. Prior to 1953, all big films served the dual purpose of providing entertainment and history lessons with "redeeming social value." BIRTH OF A NATION. The first BEN-HUR and MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY. Then, in 1939, GONE WITH THE WIND, of course. HAMLET. Countless biographies, such as Emile Zola, the "great" Ziegfield, and Madame Curie. Then along came television, and everything changed. Everyone wanted to stay home to watch AMER1CAN BANDSTAND, DEATH VALLEY DAYS, and HOCKEY NIGHT IN CANADA for free on their expensive new home machines, rather than waste money on gas, concessions, and movie tickets to see "the same old, same old." (The "concessions" in the family Frigidaire were far cheaper, and Jiffy Pop was just a few years away.) Hollywood had to come up with something new, and they did, starting with HOUSE OF WAX: the so-called "3D" film, which continues to break the budget of every American family with spoiled kids right up to this very day! The crowning irony is that HOUSE OF WAX still is the best 3D flick of all time, especially with its paddle ball gimmick. Even more ironic, is spells out Hollywood's sinister game plan, to replace solid Western Civilization history lessons with Cheap Thrills. During the prologue of this story, Vincent Price's character represents Golden Age Hollywood, all about quality and worth. But when unprincipled rivals cut into his bottom line, this wax house proprietor sinks immediately to the bottom of the barrel to become a monstrously-deformed crass serial killer, only "in it for the money." Never before or since has a major America Industry been so honest about its evil intentions. So kudos for HOUSE OF WAX, the best 3D flick ever, as well as the most honest film in history!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Vincent Price's Best Movie Roles-A Classic Even in 2D</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a remake of the old "Mystery of the Wax Museum" film from the 1930's. (Bonus-The Warner DVD has this on it's reverse side.) No mystery in this version. We know who the insane villain is, almost at once! Stylish and well done, it plays just fine in a good restored copy in 2D and "WarnerColor". Often shortened to 77 minutes by trimming out a bit of redundant dialog, and an almost risqué can-can number, which is totally unnecessary. Carolyn Jones has a small but important role as the bubble-headed blonde victim who becomes the body and head of "Joan of Arc". Charles Bronson (under his real name) plays the husky deaf-mute sculptor "Igor". Great fun as it doesn't take itself too seriously. The running gag is that people in the movie are "frozen" for a second, but not really wax figures, including Igor's head! Of course, things are thrown at the camera for the 3D gimmick, and one almost isn't in the scanned frame (it's too high). The paddle ball "barker" is slightly annoying and not impressive in 2D. As much fun as ever and a great Halloween movie that's certainly not too scary, by today's standards. The hot wax looks like "pink bubble gum soup". It should be closer to "flesh-tone". (Beware of the gory and stupidly horrible 2005 remake.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) refuses to sensationalize his wax museum like all the others. His meticulous work is second to none but his business partner Matthew Burke wants better attendance. Jarrod refuses to lower his high brow historical recreations and tries to get Sidney Wallace to buy out Burke in 3 months. Burke needs the money now and burns down the building for the $25k insurance. Jarrod refuses and tries to stop Burke. Jarrod is believed to have died in the fire but the insurance takes a long time to settle without Jarrod's body. Just as they give him the $25k, Jarrod is killed by a deformed man who steals the money. The deformed man kills Jarrod's superficial girlfriend Cathy Gray and almost kills her sweet best friend Sue Allen. Police detective Lt. Brennan investigates. The deformed man then steals Cathy's body from the morgue. Jarrod reconnects with Wallace looking for investment to reopen a new exhibition with all the grotesque violence that the public is looking for.This is touted as one of the early big 3-D movies. Although I didn't see it in 3-D, this has the prerequisite puddle ball 3-D effect. I'm sure that is loads of fun but this movie is even more than that. It's a good mass killer movie. Vincent Price is great even stuck in a wheelchair for most of the movie. The story is compelling and a fun house of horrors. It even has a bit of humor although mostly due to its campiness.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House of Wax is a remake of The Mystery of the Wax Museum. It is directed by Andre de Toth in the 3-D process. Technical gimmicks aside, this production is more reverential to the original source material. For instance, great pains have been taken to explain the main character's background; and though his motivation is not completely spelled out, the relationship he has with the imperiled women is much clearer. Vincent Price seems right at home playing this sort of part. So with such perfect casting (including not only Price but Carolyn Jones) and de Toth's assured direction, this is a decent enough version to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favourite Vincent Price flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original film this was based on, 1933's Mystery of the Wax Museum, was filmed in an early two-strip Technicolour process. This film looks as though the filmmakers tried to either match the earlier film's look, or outdo it, because the colour composition throughout is amazing, and my favourite aspect of this one.The bright oranges and reds of the fire; the deep blue tint of the nighttime scenes; the peach coloured look of Price's skin, which only serves to make it look as though he really is wearing a wax mask to hide his disfigurement, are all wonderful touches to this one. Price's unmasking and fire-scarred look is as chilling as the cold winter night's air the first time I watched this movie.The ever so lifelike mannequins engulfed in flames and rapidly melting is another chilling sight, so is the sight of the body hanging in the lift, and Price's character's (fitting) demise in a vat of boiling hot wax. Even more fitting, it is a pinkish, flesh-coloured vat of boiling hot wax.The combination of Price's wonderfully over the top performance, brilliant colour composition, and a few genuine scares make this my favourite of Price's horrors.</fullReview>

Back then it could only be seen in the theaters and to be honest once it came out on VHS and DVD it never had it's 3D release, sure you could watch it with the red/green glasses but the effect is never the same as with the real 3D Blu Ray experience and finally 2014 gave us it's European real 3D Blu Ray release. Have seen the real 3D of Creature From The Black Lagoon (1954) and liked it I was looking forward to see of the first 3D ever is still worth watching within the new 3D releases and I must admit, it works fine and really give you a 3D experience the whole movie.It's indeed a remake of the 1933 classic Mystery Of The Wax Museum. Some lines are just a copy but also here we do have strong performances. And it also has some creepy scenes. People knowing me do know I'm not fond of the horrors made in the fifties and sixties but this one I do like a lot. It even has a bit of black comedy. I watched it together with one who saw it back then in a theater and he was looking out for the commercial break which was added and the 3D experience with the balls, and it still works, it's the kind of 3D that comes out of your screen, a thing that isn't done that much these days, today it's more in-screen. Great storyline, excellent performances, excellent Vincent Price and great 3D effects....Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 3/5 Story 4/5 Comedy 1/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You may be disappointed if you're expecting a pure horror film, although it may scare you, but allow the film to play itself out and hopefully you'll appreciate the House of Wax like I did. It did have mild elements of horror, some comedic moments, and some fine acting; look for an early appearance from Charles Buchinsky, better known as Charles Bronson, who plays a deaf mute named Igor. Vincent Price also does a fine job, and is less hammy, but he is very charming, and I felt sorry that his character suffered as he did. I thought the female leads, Phyllis Kirk and Carolyn Jones, were mediocre and wooden at best, but that didn't take away from this solid film. The wax museum/shop added a nice touch, but the real reason to see this film is the performance of Vincent Price. As I said above, I thought this could've used a little more horror, but it was still a fun film that added many different elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable remake of Mystery of the Wax Museum stars Vincent Price as the sculptor-turned-killer Prof. Henry Jarrod. While I personally prefer the original film to its more famous remake, I still find this one a lot of fun. The plot isn't very surprising. Right from the start you know certain key elements even without having seen the prior film. But the movie isn't about surprise really. It's about shocks in Grand Guignol style. There are some effective shocks though and it's all directed well. The sets, the colors, the makeup effects are all rich. Vincent Price is awesome but when isn't he? House of Wax also features one of the first screen appearances from Charles Bronson as Price's lab assistant. (listed on the credits under his given name Charles Buchinsky). That's worth a gander.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color Version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andre De' Toth directed this remake, set in the late 19th century, that stars Vincent Price as Professor Henry Jarrod, whose wax museum was destroyed(along with his prized Marie Antoinette statue) in a fire caused by a greedy partner. 18 months later(after the partner was killed), Jarrod resurfaces in a wheelchair, but opening a new wax museum, with amazingly life-like exhibits with the help of Ivan(played by a young Charles Bronson!) His assistant has a friend(played by Phyllis Kirk) who becomes an object of interest for Jarrod(she resembles his Marie Antoinette), though new disappearances have brought on the suspicion of the police. Can the crippled Professor be responsible for these crimes? Entertaining film originally presented in 3-D, with Vincent Price being quite memorable and menacing. Film's plot is obvious, certain elements silly and melodramatic, but overall this version is a fun improvement over "Mystery Of The Wax Museum"(1933). Carolyn Jones is amusing playing an unfortunate victim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly methodical horror that maintains the ability to charm and entertain</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Professor Henry Jarrod (Vincent Price) is a wax sculptor who prides himself of making pure artistic creations of historical figures such as John Wilkes Booth and Marie Antoinette. His business partner and main investor, Matthew Burke (Roy Roberts), pushes Jarrod for a more gruesome 'Chamber of Horrors' display, but when Jarrod refuses to be drawn into such exploitative tactics to lure an audience, Burke sets his workshop alight to claim the insurance. Leaving Jarrod for dead, Burke receives the payout but is murdered by a strange disfigured man, and made to look like a suicide. Jarrod turns up eighteen months later with a new exhibit, and thinks he has found his perfect Marie Antoinette in Sue Allen (Phyllis Kirk). But Sue thinks she recognises some of the faces on the displays, namely her recently murdered best friend Cathy Gray (Carolyn Jones).House of Wax was the first major studio release in 3-D, after the success of Bwana Devil (1952), and really kicked off what is now known as the 'golden age' of 3-D cinema. Of course, 3-D would enjoy revivals in both the 1980's and the modern day, with the release of James Cameron's Avatar (2009) really re-inventing the medium. Watching it in regular 2-D, the film does raise a lot of unintentional laughs in scenes where 3-D is obviously being used, but playing no real part in the narrative. Just before the opening night of Jarrod's new display, an entertainer stands outside with two paddleballs, batting the balls at the screen and even talking to the audience ("Hey, look, there's someone with popcorn!"). It is really a cheap trick in order to add a niche to a horror movie that adds relatively nothing new to the genre, but it also gives the film an irresistible charm, and a nice window into one of many little crazes that pop up in cinema from time to time.The film itself is thoroughly enjoyable, regardless of being pretty run- of-the-mill. Remaking the marvellous pre-code horror Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933), Andre de Toth's re-imagining has the benefit of being able to be a little more sinister, and with the added luxury of Vincent Price. Price is pretty much the same character here as he is in most of his other horror appearances - charming, softly-spoken, but subtly menacing - playing a man who had to witness his prized possessions go up in smoke in front of his eyes - an experience that seems to have twisted his outlook on humanity. This is pure old-school horror, complete with lavish Technicolor (the '50's horror films commonly had a polished studio look), supporting ladies with aggravating screams, and a restraint on the gore. This is a key example of how the horror genre can produce an average, methodical film, that maintains the ability to charm, and most importantly, entertain. Also, watch out for an early performance from Charles Bronson, playing one of Jarrod's assistant Igor.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I recall, the audience really erupted when those paddle balls went flying at us in 1953. What a great effect that startles even today in 2-D. By far, Wax was the most popular movie of the short-lived 3-D craze, which is not surprising given how much fun it is. A lot of credit should go to director de Toth. The pacing never sags, plus the final build-up is real edge-of-your-seat excitement. I may be wrong, but this seems one of the first horror films in Technicolor. 3-D really needed the color to be effective at a time when b&amp;w still dominated the horror genre. Then too, catch Carolyn Jones (Cathy) snuggle up to old man Burke (Roberts), with eyes big enough to swallow the screen. What a natural effect that is. But effects or no, the movie's still a lot of fun, even after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The audience will probably work out what's going on in 'House of Wax' a lot sooner than the characters do but it's still an effective movie with Vincent Price in his first horror role, that of a sculptor whose beloved wax museum is burnt down by his business partner. Price is believed dead but he later resurfaces with a new exhibition, coinciding with a series of mysterious deaths...This is a big improvement on its source material, the 1933 dullard 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum'. Price is excellent, the direction is sure- handed and there are some genuinely creepy moments like the wax faces melting in the blaze. This was originally released in 3D and it's not hard to spot the gimmicky sequences (the annoying huckster and his infernal paddles, for instance) but they don't distract much from what is an otherwise gripping chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Late Night Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Prof. Henry Jarrod loves his wax figures that he has created with love and passion by his own hands. The wax works-of-art seems to be the professors only love outside of the historical museum itself - but one wax figure stands tall over the rest Marie Antoinette, the professors most cherished wax-work. He will seek revenge on those that have destroyed everything he's worked for and everything he loves.This is the best version of the film I have seen (although I have yet to see the 2005 remake to fairly judge).This is a good late night film to watch - maybe making it (House of Wax) a double feature with the original "Mystery of the Wax Museum (1933)".7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is something of a landmark film, at least in the horror genre, that genre that flourished before the slasher notion took hold. It had competent management cinematically. The effects were not hokey. Though it was in 3d, the use of dimension was understated. Ironically, it features an artist who is crippled and who needs assistants to do his work. The director of this film was visually handicapped and could not see the space, and relied on assistants. Since this is a tedg comment, we may as well get the folding issues out of the way:Right after the intermission, the new wax museum is opened and a barker attracts customers. As he chats up the passers-by, he turns to the movie audience and talks to them. In the original 3d, this folding effect is emphasized by his paddling one of those balls on an elastic that he punches at on-screen characters before punching at the audience. Clever.The notion of wax figures representing life figures and the conflating of the two is an idea similar to one used extensively elsewhere, mostly in cons and stories acting. Its surrounded here by the character Price plays, which mirrors the situation. We see him before the tragedy in a "normal" state. After the tragedy (during which we see many statue faces melt), he has a melted face. He covers it sometimes with a wax mask that reproduces his undamaged face. These some disguise of his mobility as well.The curious thing is that this different than the wax-face dynamic that forms the horror. In this version of the story, the victims are usually dead and are selected because their face is special. Some statues are of the actual persons inside them and are worth seeing because the murder of that very person is newsworthy. Some other statues are related to the person within because the face is appropriate for the character depicted.It may sound trivial, me nitpicking these things, but I think they matter. There's a process that happens when you enter a film. You literally enter a world. The more clear the world is and the more effectively you are introduced to it, the deeper you can immerse yourself in the effect, in this case horror. Its an art, that process of introduction and part of the art is giving us a situation we can enter, usually subconsciously.Other Price movies do this superbly. "Theater of Blood" is perhaps the best. It also happens to be deeply folded, where the drama and presentation of the movie is folded into the plays within. Here we have all the components, and we go halfway, but it just doesn't work.Just watch it, and you'll see what I mean. Its a failure. Other versions have the basic mechanics better.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am a voice calling in the wilderness but I found this remake far inferior to the original (THE MYSTERY OF THE WAX MUSEUM). Not only was the cinematography (two strip Technicolor) and art direction stunning in the original, it was tighter, more sinister. The license the remake takes in changing the characters of the women completely and inserting a lot of effects just for the 3-D audience tends to weaken the work as a film itself. It didn't scare me, it didn't even entertain me. Give me Michael Curtiz' original anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is inspired by 1933's The Mystery of The House of Wax.many scenes are identical and some of the dialogue is verbatim,but this version is much more fleshed out,both story wise,and character wise.it's also on a grander scale.however,for me,most of the characters were not that interesting,and there were no real standout performances as there were in original version.there was more excitement and suspense in this one,though.unfortunately in my mind,there are a few scenes of filler,or at least what seems like filler to me.one unfortunate aspect of this version is that it was filmed in 3D,but the DVD version is not,so in some scenes,it's clear they existed for the 3D value,but have little point here.i didn't find it scary,but it certainly was macabre and morbid.all in all,not a bad movie,but not quite as good as its inspiration. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House of Wax (1953) *** (out of 4) A brilliant sculptor (Vincent Price) is betrayed by his partner and is left for dead inside a burning building. Time passes and the sculptor re-appears and sets out for revenge by finding bodies, putting them in wax and opening up a house of horrors. This remake of Mystery in the Wax Museum isn't nearly as good as the original but it still remains a lot of fun due in large part to the terrific performance by Price. No matter how silly a story was or how silly a role was, Price was always the type of actor to give it his all and make something out of nothing. He's given a pretty good role here and does a nice job with it by bringing all sorts of energy to it. It's also fun seeing a young Charles Bronson playing Price's murdering hands. Phyllis Kirk plays the lead female but I've never really cared too much for her in the film. She's just a tad bit too bland for my liking. Another annoying thing when you watch this in 2D is the fact that there are several moments where the original 3D effects are being used and this distracts from the film when not viewing it in its original form. The special effects, especially the last one with Price's face, are all very well done and stand up quite well today. I don't think this is the greatest example of a horror film from the decade but it's a pleasant entertainment from start to finish.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too much silly humor and lady-in-distress hysterics...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Handsome 3D remake of 1933's "Mystery of the Wax Museum" has a great production design and a creepy star-turn from Vincent Price, but a plot that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. In early 1900s New York, a talented, slightly dotty sculptor has his wax museum burned down by a greedy financial partner; year later, with his hands and face disfigured by the blaze, the dedicated artist attempts another waxworks--only this time the historical figures are more alarmingly lifelike than ever. With perhaps a bit more depth and sophistication, this might have been a colorful portrait of insanity--but, alas, the filmmakers are only interested in popcorn thrills (thus the corny jokes and the hammy overtures to the audience). Price's character is given short-shrift in favor of the set-pieces, though he manages one or two amazing moments in this, his first foray into the horror genre. Because Crane Wilbur's screenplay is so scrappy and halfhearted, there's hardly any suspense. The incidentals are intriguing, however, as is the excellent usage of color and sound effects. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw the trailer, I couldn't wait to go to the movie and see it, but what a disappointment! I thought it would be a sort of pursuit between the wax-people and the characters, but no sir... I found it (especially the first half) a movie that builds up very slowly, without any exciting stuff happening (only talking and talking and talking), asking yourself if it's a horror movie or a bedtime story! The second half is slightly better, because that's were the killing starts, but also here I find it not very amusing... The name of the movie (and the pictures en trailers) let you assume that there will be several people in wax that will (attempt to) murder a bunch of people that are on their way to a football-game. But no! It's only one person in the movie that commits the murders and transforms the dead body's in wax... AND THAT'S IT, nothing else is happening....So for me, it's not a good movie. I think the director has made movies that are a hole lot better than this one! So spare you the disappointment and the money and go rent the scream-trilogy... You will end up with more cash in your wallet and you sure will have some scary moments (unlike this one)....</fullReview>
