		<shortDescription>A gem!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I fell in love with this movie the very first time I watched it on cable. Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith were perfect in this tale of grief in the aftermath of the loss of a child. Elijah Wood, Thora Birch, and Sheila McCarthy round out the cast and make this a poignant tale.Melanie Griffith was never as vulnerable and powerful as she was in this movie - and I liked her in Working Girl and A Stranger Among Us. This was by far her most affecting role. And the almost always underrated Don Johnson turns in another versatile and incredibly touching performance. And the emotion between their two characters is clearly palpable throughout their estrangement in this film. 'Paradise' truly is a gem! If you haven't seen it, do so. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touches the heart and soul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a short essay after watching this movie, not because it affected me, but that it left such a great impression. To me, the use of 'Paradise' as title is apt, as the movie goes to show how many people continue to live in their private hells, when all around them is a place which seems like paradise. These people, though socially interactive at times, seem more preoccupied with the ghosts of their pasts rather than the blessings of the moment. Only when these characters are able to let go of the demons that haunt them are they able to once again experience the joys of love and intimacy.This film can help us to evaluate the things that we allow to control us, and help us to understand that instead of examining our lives under a microscope, we should allow ourselves to look up and out sometimes, and maybe discover all those things missing in our lives but which were right by us all the time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was surprised and touched by this film, starring two actors I do not normally enjoy. The on-screen chemistry between Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, as grieving parents, isolated in their grief, was amazing. Elijah Wood is convincing in his role as a friend's child, visiting the couple, and going through his own family turmoil. Also excellent is Thora Birch, one of the most gifted child actors I have had the pleasure of watching. A wonderfully touching and uplifting film about hope and risk and coming home. One of my top five movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very sweet movie I have watched 3 times since renting it, and would have watched it more if I didn't have to take it back. I would love to own this movie so I could watch it at least once a week! Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson are wonderful as a married couple in a lot of pain, but still very much in love. Elijah Wood is excellent in his role. Both Melanie and Don do a wonderful job. Don Johnson is so gifted as an actor who can show so much emotion without ever uttering one word, it never ceases to amaze me. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Surprisingly good. The cinematography and screenplay were excellent. Griffith played the role beautifully as did Don Johnson. This was the only movie that I liked both actors in. Elijah Wood's best performance too. This movie should have been nominated for many awards. It isn't often that the screenplay, acting, setting and theme come together so poignantly and effectively. I'd give this movie a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Trouble in Paradise (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty good drama about several people dealing with difficult problems. At the center of the story is Williard Young (Elijah Wood), a lonely little boy who is sent to his mother's friend's house for summer vacation in a quiet, small town.There has been a quiet, untouched bubble of emotional problems among the residences of the town who are the main characters of the story. And Williard's visit seems to make the bubble burst and each is forced to finally confront the problems they had been hiding for so long.Primarily, that is between the Reeds, the people who Williard is staying with. Lily Reed (Melanie Griffith) is the quiet, fragile type, damaged by the death of their infant son some time ago, creating a pain in her heart that she had never been quite able to get rid of. And it seems as though, it is not something she wants to let go or to stop blaming herself for. This decision, unfortunately, keeps her apart from her husband, Ben Reed (Griffith's then-husband, Don Johnson [hubba hubba]) who can't seem to get close to his wife, and has become bitter in his many unsuccessful attempts.Williard's presence, however brings them together, since both Lily and Ben, enjoy his company once they warm up to him, of course. He is like the surrogate son type. Though their relationship with Williard is often shared separately, Williard tries what he can to bring the two together once and for all, because he knows that they still love each other. They just don't know how to get over the past and get their lives back together again. It takes an awful lot of coaxing and some teary moments, of course. Melanie Griffith pulls out all the stops for this role, as does Don Johnson. And it works quite wonderfully because you can really see how much their son's death really effected them, especially Lily. The summer vacation with the Reeds is a sort of therapy for Williard, too. In part, his next door neighbor Billie Pike (Thora Birch) is one of the few friends he has aside from the Reeds and his time with her is a good lesson in the pangs of childhood like dealing with self-esteem, and learning the truth about his legendary father. It is an all around good drama. The story has a lot going on, and all of the actors, especially Wood and Griffith push things along quite nicely. You never get into too much rambling dialogue, and a story with children often entertains with little subplots of mischief while providing the comic relief to this teary (but not overly sentimental) movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Paradise was a beautiful yet underappreciated movie. If it weren't for HBO I probably would have never seen it. Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson play a married couple who's relationship is falling apart after the death of their baby son. Both are very good actors and play their parts very well. The scene in the attic when Don comes home drunk is amazing and not the mess that it had the potential of being.Elijah Wood is playing a small a 10 year old I believe who's father says that he's away at work but is really leaving his mother. He is in private school and doesn't have any friends. One summer his mother sends him to his aunt's house, most likely to try to hide the truth from him. Elijah isn't the best actor, but he's very good for his age. Not to mention the cutest thing that you've ever seen.Thora Birch is a little country girl who doesn't know who her father is and has a mother who really can't keep a relationship to save her life. She doesn't have many friends either but is very smart and inquisitive. Thora Birch is incredibly adorable and well on her way to her excellent role in 'American Beauty.'The movie is somewhat slow moving at the beginning but builds up to a great movie. Everything is believable. Don and Melanie are great together. Thora Birch and Elijah Wood also make a great duo. This is definitely a film worth seeing. Don't be turned off just because you haven't heard of it. It's better than a lot of that trash that is highly advertised.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise Regained!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've lost count of the number of times I've seen this film. Even among the fairly good films shown on TV nowadays, 'Paradise' stands out because of its simplicity and naturalism. The plot in itself is not new. It's about a person (a little boy in this case), who reconciles a troubled couple. And it's about the couple themselves, who have become estranged after the loss of their child. Jon Bon Jovi and Demi Moore did that turn in Jovi's 'Destination Anywhere', which was good, but I'd recommend the album not the film! What films with similar plots perhaps lacked was the gigantic effort that everyone in this film has put in - from the director to the actors, the music director, the set designer...I can go on and on... What we see seems almost not a film, the acting is so natural, it seems effortless!Perhaps the fact that Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson were married in real life at the time helped, they share a great chemistry on screen, which helps when you are playing such emotionally charged roles. Elijah Wood is absolutely angelic as Willard. I had seen him in three other movies before I saw him in this one and I was pleasantly surprised to watch what a pro he was even as a wee kid! His big break of late has of course been 'The Lord of the Rings' trilogy, and I hope he continues to act in more sensitively made films. About Thora Birch - boy, this has got to be her most impressive performance till date! Even bettering the ones she's given in 'Now and Then' and 'American Beauty'. She's a veritable scene stealer as the precocious tomboy Billie Pike! And never has friendship between kids been portrayed with such disarming innocence - a credit that goes as much to Wood and Birch as to the director, Mary Agnes Donoghue who has managed to get such incredible performances from all her actors. Sheila McCarthy is perfect as the single working mother of Billie who idolizes Joan Collins and for whom marriage equals security, not love. Her character though minor, is very well etched and poignant. In terms of poignancy, one might wonder at the character of Louise Latham. She makes a cameo appearance as Catherine Reston Lee, a painter living in seclusion in her little house by the lake which Billie visits on one of her wild jaunts. The only thing we hear of her later is when Billie tells Willard that she has given her some watercolors with which she is now painting. Perhaps it is an indication that Billie too will become a painter once she has grown up. The character most likely has a bigger part to play in the book on which the film is based. Even so, the screenplay of this film is one of the best. Donoghue has succeeded in really getting under the skin of her characters. This is also one of the few rare films in which natural beauty forms a part of the unfolding drama and adds a wonderful atmosphere to it. Not surprisingly, like many of its predecessors, this film was also shot in South Carolina. Last but not least, this is a bit of trivia many would be interested in - the music of this film is composed by David Newman and it is really good. What many of you might have guessed is that he's the brother of THE Thomas Newman who has has composed great music for such films like 'American Beauty', 'Little Women', 'How to Make American Quilt', 'The Shawshank Redemption','Road to Perdition' etc. Genius, I guess runs in the Newman family!'Paradise', the film IS what the title means, see it to believe it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent family movie about the perils of growing up. (POSSIBLE MINOR SPOILERS)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Paradise" reveals much about children of people who don't take the time to care/supervise their kids and have no father. While the film is basically a drama, its strength comes from dealing with the conflict of being forced into a lifestyle one would not voluntarily choose after there father's not around. Nevertheless, the film portrays children as resilient, capable of not only facing such challenges, but mastering them.This is definitely a movie parents should view and discuss with their kids. So many topic are presented, some directly and others in a more subtle manner, including, authority, creativity, punishment, rebellion, justice, discipline, practice, seeking approval, friendship, becoming part of something larger than yourself, pride, and lessons one learns outside of the classroom. The camera work and direction is superb and worthy of larger budget films, the acting is outstanding in word and deed. And the sound track, including music and sound effects is one of Donoghue's best efforts.There is a certain "cuteness" to it, but the overall tone of the film is super and the presentation by the young people makes you proud of their efforts. Every 11-year-old must learn to make his or her way in the world by fitting in. However painful the experience of growing up is, we tend to forget it as the years pass.This movie makes adults ponder the uncertainty of youth and many will have had the revelation of Billie by the end of the film. If you are capable of serious thought, "Paradise" will make you think about life differently.Paradise is a great movie. is an up and rising movie sensation. The rest of the cast isn't bad either. If I could buy this movie I would. It is the story of a boy named Willard who is sent to his aunt and uncle's, who are trying to survive a tragedy in the summer. The rest you'll have to see for yourself. Once again Thora Birch shows us that she is an awesome actress. She plays all her parts so well and I know she works hard for what shes earned. She's pretty and a talented actress. Elijah Wood is great in this movie and makes it enjoyable to watch. .I think that Paradise was awesome.Melanie Griffith did a great job. Elijah Wood worked hard and he looked great in the movie. You would love it. The chemistry between Elijah's character and Thora's character was the best I've seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remember "The Good Son" with Elijah Wood and Macaulay Culkin? Well McCauley was already famous, but Elijah was just starting. In this film, Elijah has a similar and very believable personality when he is stuck with a couple going through some rough times. It seems everybody seems to learn from his caring and honest manner as much as he learns from his life in the simple south. Melanie Griffith also does a good job in a very tough role, being hurt and numb after a very dramatic event in her life. Everything fits well in the plot and you can never really tell what the end will bring. Just a great all around film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise is finding what we lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Life is not always pretty. Neither is unresolved grief. But innocence is always beautiful. A couple in a small town lose their only child to a tragic accident. This sensitive motion picture deals with how the human soul reacts to personal loss and how it changes lives. The kind of movie you want to own so you can revisit it from time to time since its theme touches us all deeply. The scenery is gorgeous, the town is small and peaceful. The characters are meaningful and real. Unspoken bonds run deep throughout. A heartfelt film that captures our yearning for a father. This is a soul changing journey for a childless man who never got to be one. At first indifferent and angry, he inadvertently discovers something which he thought he might never experience, through the inescapable and magical innocence of a visiting young boy who seems to somehow understand his plight. Both he and his wife find themselves confronted in a way that changes them forever. This film is a forgotten gem.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coulda been a contenda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of 1991's "Paradise" is great. It's essentially a coming-of-age story of two 9 year-olds (Elijah Wood and Thora Birch) on the Atlantic coast near Chrarleston, SC (shot on location). The locations are breathtaking and illustrate that every area has its unique beauty. The film's also about a couple who Elijah is visiting for the Summer (Birch's character is a neighbor). The couple (Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) are on the verge of divorce due to a tragedy a few years earlier. Wood's visit is instrumental in reviving them as individuals and as a couple.The first half is so well done that I thought I stumbled upon a hidden gem but, unfortunately, the second half falls into mediocrity. The awkward and contrived scenes with questionable acting/dialogue could've worked if the filmmakers simply worked out the kinks through rewriting, reshooting, better editing, etc. but it's clear that they had to finish the picture on a limited budget. They got the job done, and that's great, but if they spent a little more time, a little more money and tried a little harder they could've had a near masterpiece.This is the only movie that I can remember where Don Johnson plays a major protagonist (I've never seen Miami Vice) and it shows that he should've been a major ultra-cool masculine actor, like Clint Eastwood, Thomas Jane, Charles Bronson and a gazillion others.Sarah Trigger plays Birch's hot half-sister, but she's barely seen, which is a shame because she's so beautiful. They probably cut some of her scenes out. If you don't remember her, she played Steve Martin's redhead babe in "Grand Canyon." BOTTOM LINE: This coming of age film has numerous great moments, particularly in the first half -- moments of wonder, beauty, discovery and companionship. It's too bad they drop the ball in the second half. Regardless, it's a very worthwhile movie and Johnson shows his greatness. Like the movie, he coulda been a contenda.The film runs 111 minutes.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie concerns upon a boy(Elijah Wood) is sent by his pregnant mummy to remain the idyllic summer with ancient marriage friends(Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith) in the countryside.The couple has numerous problems originated for unfortunate tragedy for years before.Elijah befriends with his neighbour small girl and takes interest with Don, fishing shrimps and speaking about interesting issues.It's a brilliant and touching story although sometimes is slow moving and tired but is developed with intelligence and sensibility.In the picture are treated ethics and morals themes narrated with great sense of fairness and ductility.Good Melanie Griffith(at the time wedded to each other until Antonio Banderas) interpretation as an embittered woman who will must to face the traumatic truth.Elijah Wood as sensible boy is nice,he's a newcomer and would have much success years later converting himself in a first wold star(Lord of the rings).Thora Birch is enjoyable ,she is ready as future star(American beauty,the Hole,Ghost world) . Excellent and sensitive score by David Newman.Besides exceptional and awesome cinematography by Jerzy Zielinsky as is reflected on the marvelous outdoors in the country. The motion picture is accurately directed by Mary Agnes Donoghue(Beaches). Rating : Better than average and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paradise indeed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is one of my favorites. When I came to see it I was by no means expecting a movie that would capture and inspire me the way 'Paradise' actually did.As with many other extraordinary movies, both the plot and the actors have managed to leave a lasting impression on my mind.First of all, the four protagonists of the story are simply wonderfully cast. There is hardly any movie in which the main characters manage to interact in a more sophisticated and authentic manner as in this one. Elijah Wood as young Willard has a gift of working so impressively with facial expressions and has genuine, very subtle acting skills that allow him to act as if he would not act. He has acquired a level of acting many average actor never attain in their entire lives. Willard is very much an outcast figure, with a strained mother, bullied at school and somehow too smart to be a normal kid. Now he has to spend the summer on the countryside, in a sleepy fishing village with the Reeds family.The Reeds are played by Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith. They portray a couple that has to live with a deep scar, a huge burden of the past, which gradually destroys their relationship. Now in real life, the two of them were married twice ? and actually married during the shooting, which adds a very spicy element to the movie itself. Their private relationship might have had some sort of influence on their acting performances, and maybe this aspect caused the tremendously strong quality of the interactive scenes between the two of them.Now as Willard enters into the lives of the Reeds, their problems resurface and the friction intensifies as both of them discover a very honest affection towards the charming boy. This is an affection that makes the old wounds hurt and leads to an emotional climax that is simply one of the finest I have ever seen in a movie like this one which is not primarily arranged as a real-life drama, but rather meant to provide some light entertainment.The Reeds' painful struggle with their past's legacy is the strongest aspect of the movie, and as stated above, brilliantly elaborated on. Elijah's adventures with Thora Birch, the fourth main character, makes up the second major theme of 'Paradise', a theme that has much more light-heartedness and is both funny and sweet in the most positive aspect of the word. They discover the bonds of friendship and experience the inspiring magic of one summer in Paradise.The storyline, based on the French production 'Le Grand Chemin', is very sophisticated and convincingly transformed. Willard has to face challenges and the hardships of life, he learns lessons and has to proof his courage and character more than once. The movie features outstanding character portrayals and profound emotions which pervade the atmosphere and make you identify with the protagonists as if you were there and knew them ? an incredible accomplishment. I fell in love with it at the first glance, and it truly deserves a solid 9, if not a 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I saw Paradise for the first time, I wasn't expecting much.However, not only is paradise gorgeously filmed, its heart-wrenching story is beautifully filmed and acted. No other movie I've ever seen speaks so clearly about the pain of losing a child--and what it can do to the marriage of the surviving parents (statistics show that most marriages end shortly after in divorce).And best of all, hooray for the true message of the film, that love conquers all! Paradise is definitely one of my top-ten favorite films of all time.I wasn't a fan of either Don Johnson or Melanie Griffith before seeing Paradise, but the film completely turned me around on both counts. Someone out there, please give Don Johnson some more dramatic roles!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a heartfelt drama starring Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, who play couple Lily and Ben Reed, who having experienced a family tragedy. With their love for each other on the rocks, their relationship may be rekindled with the visit of young Willard Young (Elijah Wood).The title "Paradise" is fitting for this movie, as it is filmed in the quiet countryside by the lake, making you forget your troubles and inner-demons, which is exactly what Lily and Ben are trying to do in the story. Many people live seemingly happy lives, but are still haunted by past mishaps, missed opportunities and mistakes. However, it is when you live and learn and let go could you enjoy the many blessings life has to offer in the present time, elements which is beautifully depicted in this film.Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson had great on-screen chemistry and young Elijah Wood did a heartwarming job in his Williard Young role. The story is a little slow at times, but the overall message of letting go and enjoying the finest things in life (in a Paradise setting) would resonate in your mind and make you appreciate this film.Grade B+</fullReview>

The ten year old Willard Young, played by Elijah Wood, similar to his role as Frodo Baggins of Lord of the Rings becomes the protagonist of the movie. His unconditional love and affection to the surrounding cast leave a trail of transformational outcomes beyond rigidity and indifference to life. At the same time the viewer has the opportunity to relive their childhood experiences and reflect on what is valuable.

		<shortDescription>the American re-make machine strikes again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The bittersweet 1987 French drama 'Le Grand Chemin' has been reworked into a vehicle for Don Johnson and Melanie Griffith, taking the same story and turning it into a big screen pacifier for undiscriminating moviegoers (with an aversion to sub-titles). The original version was drawn from director Jean-Loup Hubert's childhood memories of the summer he spent with an estranged, small town couple, learning about life while they come to terms with the death of their own son. The watered-down American model is based on nothing except the overwhelming desire to make a sugar-coated box office hit, presenting the young boy as a cuddly matchmaker for his surrogate parents. Writer director Mary Agnes Donoghue does her best to make the experience as painless as possible, but in the process smooths out all the rough edges of the story. The film, as a result, should have been easy to dislike, but it really doesn't provoke any strong emotions, pro or con: it's too bland, too generic, and (thankfully, for the filmmakers) too harmless.</fullReview>
