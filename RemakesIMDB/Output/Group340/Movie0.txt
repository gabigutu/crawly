		<shortDescription>Slick and stylish Hitchcock update</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went into A Perfect Murder expecting to enjoy it, but I recognised the fact that I wouldn't be in for a great film. To be honest, I love thrillers like this as they offer a solid two hours (or so) of non-too taxing entertainment, and what's not to like about that? A Perfect Murder is an update of the Hitchcock classic 'Dial M For Murder', and while the film doesn't touch Hitchcock's in terms of how thrilling it is, this update has been well handled and despite losing things such as the claustrophobia and the tight plot, A Perfect Murder still does what you'd expect it to do. The plot has become more expansive for this update, but the filmmakers have still managed to keep it tight so that the plot is focused mainly on the characters as opposed to the actual crime. The plot follows a rich man (Michael Douglas) who discovers that his trophy wife (Gweneth Paltrow) is having an affair with an artist (Viggo Mortensen). When his business affairs start to go awry, he decides to commit the perfect murder so that he can inherit his wife's trust fund. However, as all of us Hitchcock fans know; there's no such thing as the perfect murder.Michael Douglas was the absolute perfect choice for this role. He may get typecast as the slimy businessman often, but he does it so well! You can really believe that he wants to kill his wife. Gweneth Paltrow, who is often solid but never outstanding; and Viggo Mortensen, who is actually a good actor, join him and make up the three-piece central cast. Mortensen's performance here isn't awesome; but it's good, and hints at the sort of stuff that would be to come - such as a great turn in David Cronenberg's A History of Violence. Like most nineties thrillers, this one is very stylishly shot and there's a focus on the more steamy elements of the story. The locations used aptly convey the groups within society that the characters belong to and the film does a good job of setting its scenes. The central set piece is well executed, and the build up to it is well done also; but it has to be said that the film starts to fall apart a little after that. Still, A Perfect Murder never becomes boring and even during it's down time; the film still manages to be thrilling. As mentioned, this isn't as great as Hitchcock's version - but as modern remakes go - this certainly isn't a bad one, and I recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves a better IMDb score</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie has a low rating because it's a remake. And because it's a remake of a Hitchcock movie. It's kinda like when a rock band tries to cover Stairway to Heaven by Led Zeppelin. Nobody will accept it, no matter what it's like. It' doomed to fail. I saw this before I saw Hitchcock's version and I really loved this movie. I'd say it stands on it's own. The plot is not the same as in "Dial M for Murder", so should be interesting also for those who saw the original. Dialog is witty, the plot is complicated and full of surprises, yet it all makes sense. Michael Douglas is terrific as this cynical, cold-blooded businessman who decides to get his unfaithful wife murdered. Cheating is very very wrong, so he has an understandable motive. It's not an excuse to murder anyone, but Douglas's character believes he has this perfect plan, with no risk of getting caught..I really recommend this. I'd give it 7.5 but since there is no half points in IMDb, I gave it an eight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Micheal Douglas (Steven) and Gwenyth Paltrow (Emily) are a married couple. Emily falls in love and has an affair with a young painter, David Shaw (Mortensen). Hiding the affair and making a tense move, Emily is put in the position to tell Steven or not. One way or another Steven has a plan, a plan to murder his own wife....with a little help from the someone else.I really love this movie. I try to watch it as much as possible. In this movie it is set to the level of Micheal Douglas's creepy and insanity side of his acting. He scared me so much that I didn't feel comfortable about seeing this for the first time. Gwenyth Paltrow on the other hand, plays a very innocent and lovely role. She really doesn't have a clue what Steven and David are up to in this twisting thriller. Viggo is absolutely excellent in this movie. He gave an outstanding role and put another character on my favorite list. This is a very good movie and I recommend this movie to Alfred Hitchcock and mystery/murder fans. I would rate this 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing is perfect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually liked this movie, but the ending was bad.Summary: Steven Taylor and Emily have been married for quite some time yet Emily feels trapped and controlled by Steven so she seeks comfort in the arms of David, a broke artist with a hidden past. Steven knows about the affair yet Emily has no idea that he knows. Steven approaches David and lets him know that he knows everything about David's past and then blackmails him. He pays 100 grand and tells David he will pay another 400 grand after the job is done. What job? Oh, for killing Emily, his wife. David accepts and Steven tells him how to murder Emily and it sounds flawless until Emily manages to kill the intruder in her home and at Steven's surprise, it's not David!In such cases as these where rich people get married, I understand why there should be a pre-nuptial agreement! The movie is a great thriller yet it lacks....something. Viggo Mortensen was David, the lover who does love Emily but loves money more. Michael Douglas, the loving yet control freak husband Steven, whose empire is falling apart and the only option he has is to kill his wife played by Gwyneth Paltrow, who works for the UN, speaks a few languages but is dumb as a doorbell when it comes to the men in her life.I rate this 7/10, the movie has lots of great twists and so on, but I saw only Michael Douglas making a real effort in this movie. Viggo was great too, but Gwyneth seems so confused through out this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Perfect At All</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder is a lot better than I thought it would be, probably because of the smart direction from director Andrew Davis (The Fugitive, Chain Reaction, Under Siege). Given a fairly involved script and an action film, (never mind the dialogue, just cut quickly to the next scene) shooting scheme, Davis has concocted a mainstream thriller that works quite well. A Perfect Murder is based on a middle rated Hitchcock film which was in turn based on a hit Broadway play called Dial M For Murder. Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas, in part revisiting Wall Street's Gordon Gecko) is in financial strife and decides to knock Emily his wife off to grab her money. She's played by the hapless Gwyneth Paltrow. Hubby blackmails his wife's lover (Viggo Mortensen) to do the dirty deed. This film is ferociously mainstream. The music chimes in just so. The bathrobe disappears just so. Michael Douglas plays Michael Douglas to perfection, Paltrow is protected from any line more than fifteen words long, but still A Perfect Murder is never boring. The original Hitchcock version starred Ray Miland and Grace Kelly. There weren't any mobile phones and the wife wasn't screwing the killer. And then there was Grace Kelly rather than Gwyneth Paltrow in that old film. I know who I'd prefer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A passable remake of Hicthcock's ?Dial M for Murder'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder ( a loose remake of ?Dial M for Murder ) is astylish thriller in its own right ,but doesn't come close to theoriginal. As I remember and not to give away any of the plot, ?Dial?M' is all about the key. Where it is hidden, Who knew it was there,and who finds it. This plot line is gripping, but in ?Perfect Murder'this whole part of the story has been overlooked. Having said thatthe film still works quite well, thanks to Michael Douglas. He reallyis superb. Gwyneth Palthrow looks stunning, but David Suchet iswasted as the detective. But where the film really falls down is theending. In the original the last scenes are gripping in the hunt forthe key, but for some reason director Andrew Davis sees fit to endwith the standard formula of a shoot out. Having said that the filmis still worth seeing, but if you need to watch this story, Irecommend the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found the film to be very interesting and smoothly executed. The acting of film veteran Michael Douglas was superb. Paltrow and Mortensen were also very smooth and a pleasure to observe. My only problem with this film was the way it ended. An editing glitch? Maybe. It was too abrupt. But all in all, a very entertaining film and an excellent use of a familiar theme-plot.It should also be noted that Novella Nelson, who portrays Ambassador Alice Wills, is a noted songtress in her own right. I have had the pleasure of attending a few of her concerts and night club appearances in the 1970s. An excellent, sultry and sometimes fiery singer of jazz standards and R&amp;B.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect remake of clever stage thriller...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's DIAL M FOR MURDER was based on the Frederick Knott play of the same name. A PERFECT MURDER takes elements from the play, makes alterations in scenes and characters, changes the ending, and in attempting to modernize the whole thing has added some extra gore to the proceedings so today's audiences won't feel cheated. And yet, the result is not only distinctly disappointing, but inferior.Only fans of Gwyneth Paltrow and Michael Douglas will relish their performances in this pale rehash of the original material. The complexity of "the key under the stairmat" which was so effectively played out in the Hitchcock film is entirely missing here. The detective work so fascinating in the original play and film is also gone despite the fact that he is played by David Suchet (in a very underwritten role). In short: none of the revisions are any improvement. Nor does Viggo Mortensen impress as Paltrow's lover.Those who haven't seen the movie or the play DIAL M FOR MURDER will no doubt find some of this absorbing enough--but anyone able to make a comparison is bound to be disappointed. I'll take Ray Milland-Grace Kelly-Robert Cummings under Hitchcock's direction any day over a misguided Paltrow and Douglas under Andrew Davis' direction.As for the comments of the viewer who said, "Who's Hitchcock?", please...spare me your review.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many plot holes to be a good thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A fine cast (Douglas, Paltrow, Mortensen, Suchet) was wasted in this feeble attempt. There were simply too many illogical holes to ignore and at the end you will feel cheated. I'll list just a few as examples. I would encourage you read on, so you may save your money and go rent Hitchcock's original instead. *****SPOILERS AHEAD*****1. David was just a con artist, so what made Steven think he could be turned into a hired killer?. Sure enough it didn't work, did it?2. In fact, David as a con artist was much more likely to try blackmail. Sure enough, David tapped the incriminating conversation. Now that he had the tape, he could easily get $400K (or even more) from Steven. So why bother to kill (or contract out some thug to kill) Emily at all?? This is totally ABSURD. David just wanted to con some money and get out of town as he always did, with no incentive to kill his lover at this stage.3. When detective Karaman mentioned the missing key, Emily said nothing and went into Latino slum and tried to play detective herself. It just does not make any sense. Emily obviously would not protect Steven at that point since she not only didn't love him anymore but also had a reasonable belief that the thug was hired by her husband to kill her for her inheritance. Moreover, she and Karaman clearly developed a sense of mutual trust, so she logically would show Karaman the missing key and let him do the investigation (after all he's a police).4. The explanation Steven tried to spin on Emily about the missing key did not make sense at all. He claimed he took the key, put it on Emily's key chain and jammed the door lock because he thought the thug was David getting in with Emily's key and he tried to protect Emily's reputation. Then, he claimed the thug turned out to be just a burglar. Well, if that thug did not use Emily's key and did not pick the lock, how on earth he got in??5?...I did find one quote to be ironically hilarious. When they met at the ferry, Steven told David that they should wait and carry on business as usual. When Steven started to walk away, David asked, with a deadpan face, "Should I continue screw your wife?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plot Holes....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definite Spoilers Ahead. Please don't read if you haven't seen the film yet and want to be surprised.My biggest question -- why do directors/producers think viewers are stupid? Maybe most people just sit back and enjoy the ride...but why spend so much time and money to make a beautiful-looking movie like this, populated with some fairly good actors, and based on a good, classic story, if you don't care enough about the story to employ a thoughtful writer or two? Anyway...this movie has too many plot holes to count, but here are the most glaring, in my opinion.Why would Emily leave a comfortable, hot bath to answer the phone? In such a lushly appointed apartment, it's hard to believe it doesn't have an answering system or built-in voice mail. And even if it doen't, there's been no sign that it's going to ring an annoyingly long time when Emily starts moving to answer it.Why was Steven so easily dismissed as a suspect -- just because he was "on the phone" during the attack? Of course he didn't commit the attack -- the attacker is DEAD. His having an alibi for the time of the attack does not clear him of arranging it. If he was even considered for a moment, he wasn't a suspect for committing the attack, but for planning it...and his "alibi" doesn't clear him of that.Steven was so careful about so many parts of his "perfect murder plan" -- why would he so sloppily toss the cell phone out of his car, on his way from the poker game? If it were found (which it never was, apparently) the fact that it was on his return route would be pretty incriminating. There are plenty of places, like the East River, to toss something.It's obvious the dead man lived in a very scary neighborhood (Emily visits and it's pretty dangerous looking) -- so we're supposed to believe the killer only used one key and had one lock on his door? I live in a nice part of New York and there are four locks between the apartment and the outside world -- but Emily was able to get into that apartment with just one key. Doubtful.When Steven confronts Emily, it becomes a complication that there's something at the artist's loft connecting him to them: her wedding ring. Steven says he'll go get it. WHY does it matter if that connection exists? There are obviously many others they can't do anything about -- like the negatives to the photos he's just shown her; money that he's confessed to paying the artist; at least one of her friends who knows about the affair. And, he's supposedly a blackmailer, so wouldn't one assume he has some hidden "proof"? Why does it matter that the ring is in the loft? Surely, no matter what, Steven and Emily don't think they're going to be able to pretend Emily never had an affair with David!?When Steve hands over money in Washington Square Park, David tells him the tape is a "commemerative copy" -- there's been no guarantee (that we've heard, at least) that there's no other copy of the tape. Who would assume that was the only copy??? And of course, we soon learn it wasn't.If your husband tried to have you killed, and you had the proof (the tape), would you confront him (even with a gun in your pocket) or get the heck out and go to the police? Of course David was recording the murder plot, when Steven laid it out at his own apartment. Why wouldn't he? If Steven was such a good planner, why would he not "shake down" David to make sure he didn't have a tape recorder? It would be in character not to trust him.Argh! I want back the time I wasted watching this thing....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slick, glossy, shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M For Murder" (with a worse title) has the unfaithful wife of a New York City businessman targeted for murder. Unsurprising twists in this updated version do allow Michael Douglas to play a mean SOB again (after too many years of playing the victimized good guy), but the plot feels half-baked. Much of the movie seems to take place off-screen; mostly what we get are fatuous red herrings and character contrivances. What's with all that linguistic talent Gwyneth Paltrow possesses? What's the point?... and when Gwyneth travels to the seedy side of town to try her key in a stranger's apartment, why does the editor cut away after she dramatically enters the building? What does she find inside? Why does she tell Douglas her intentions at the end, only to freeze against the door-jam when he tries to stop her? "A Perfect Murder" isn't a dumb thriller, it's fairly tight and intriguing, and the performances are commendable, but it doesn't satisfy on a hearty level (like Hitchcock). In fact, it ends with a whimper. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts promisingly...falls apart in the final third</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It may be more credible to cite Psycho or Vertigo as your favourite Hitchcock, but my particular preference has always been Dial M for Murder. Sure, it's dated far more than a lot of Hitch's films, but it's still a tightly written and intelligent movie; Ray Milland playing a gentlemanly yet murderous businessman who plots to have his wife killed when he discovers she's having an affair and plans to leave him.A Perfect Murder, the 1998 remake, is a very different beast with different motivations and some major changes to how the plot plays out. This time, it's Michael Douglas whose wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) is playing away from home but, in a move from the source material, it's her ex-con lover who is hired to do the murder.Despite this deviation, the machinations of the murder plot from the original film are near-identical. A phone call home, a missing key, the supposed disturbed robbery, the would-be killer killed in self-defence...that's all Dial M. And, because of this, the first third of the film bounces along at a great pace.Into Act 2 and things are still promising with the introduction of David Suchet as the investigating detective. Suchet is a wonderful actor and his first scene holds much potential and evokes memories of John Williams's memorable turn as Detective Hubbard in Dial M. Suchet's Detective Karaman seems smart as a tack and asks awkward questions of our protagonists. And then, inexplicably, the character all but vanishes from the movie without doing any further detecting. In fact, the big reveal of the murder is actually just down to the wife simply snooping through her husband's clumsily-hidden evidence, rather than anyone actually pursuing a line of enquiry.As a result, the final third is really just our three main characters lying and and cheating. While it's fun to watch Douglas worm his way out of things by repeatedly changing his story, it all leads to a frankly barmy climax where the bodies start to pile up.I guess A Perfect Murder is more interested in its characters than the tightly woven plot of Dial M, but the original film had charm that this sorely lacks. While Dial M may not seem realistic in its characters' motivations or the generally breezy tone, it's by far the better movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very exciting movie.The actors are great especially Michael Douglas who is perfect as Steven Tyler who wants his wife dead and hire her lover (Viggo Mortensen) to kill her.But something goes wrong and now Steven doesn't control the situation anymore.It´s almost as good as Hitchkock's first movie which this is based on. James Newton-Howard's music is also good.I´m not a fan of Gwyneth Paltrow but she is actually rather good in this movie. I didn't like her parts in Emma and Sliding Doors. Viggo Mortensen is very good as David Shaw who Steven hires to kill his wife. David Suchet is great as the suspicious cop who doesn't trust Steven when everybody else thinks that he is a good guy.You can watch this movie and afterwards you just can't let it go out from your head. Michael Douglas has found his right style in this kind of movies.Wall Street,The Game and this one is perfect examples of a great Douglas-film.OK he was also good in Falling Down and Fatal Attraction but this Douglas is much better.The rate is:7.5 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steven finds out that his wife is having an affair with a painter named David. So Steven gets together with David and soon enough David is black mailed. Nobody's perfect and things do not go quite as planned. There are plenty of twists and turns as the plot simmers and thickens. This is a great suspense movie and I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The tension of "who knows what" is so high and from the moment he arrives, the audience knows that Steven is cold and demanding. This is a type of guy who is confident and always gets what he wants. Michael Douglas played him very well. There is plenty of suspension and secrets that flow from this movie. For people who love thriller/suspense movies, I would highly recommend this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good murder mystery thriller remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder is set in New York where financial expert Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) &amp; United Nations staff member Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) live together as husband &amp; wife, however it is in name only as their marriage is a loveless &amp; cold affair. Emily has been having an affair with small time conman &amp; artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), Steven has found out about the affair &amp; being in severe financial trouble decides to take advantage of the situation &amp; blackmails David into murdering Emily, together they devise a perfect murder but the plan goes awry &amp; Emily survives the attempted murder. The police become involved &amp; one lie after another gets Steven deeper into trouble &amp; Emily starts to suspect that he may have had something to do with her attempted murder...Directed by Andrew Davis &amp; based on Frederick Knotts stage play Dial M for Murder this was intended as a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock film Dial M for Murder (1954) which itself was based on the play, as a decent murder mystery suspense thriller A Perfect Murder isn't perfect but it's still a worthwhile film if you have the patience. The film follows the basic story of the Hitchcock original quite closely with a few changes, the man Emily is having an affair with &amp; the man Steven hires to kill here are morphed into one character now rather than being separate, the police involvement is far less in A Perfect Murder &amp; the most significant difference comes at the climax where there's no police sting &amp; there's more of a dramatic ending involving guns. Othewise the two films are very similar with Emily killing her potential killer, Steven trying to cover things up, the police suspecting him &amp; switched flat keys becoming a major clue &amp; the basic motivation remains good old fashioned money. The character's are good here, Steven played by Michael Douglas is a cunning, cool &amp; calm man who comes across as ruthless &amp; clever, Emily doesn't feel like she has a hundred million dollars to be honest but even though she's meant to be the victim she started the whole thing off by having an affair &amp; David the small time conman appears to be in it for the money even though the script never really makes it clear if he loved Emily or not. At almost an hour &amp; fifty minutes I wasn't bored by it as it's fairly gripping &amp; tense with some nice twists &amp; turns although I could see why many might find it a bit slow &amp; uneventful but I personally didn't have any problem getting into it as I like a good murder mystery.Another major change between the Hitchcock version &amp; this is that it switches the location from a posh London in the 50's to a wealthy contemporary New York, the change doesn't affect things much though. The Hitchcock original was filmed at a more innocent time so expectedly A Perfect Murder increases the profanity, the violence, the blood, the body count &amp; there's even a tastefully done love scene. The title A Perfect Murder is actually a quote from the original Dial M for Murder. Nowhere near as staged, enclosed or limited as the original there's more back-story to the character's &amp; more happens even though the two are basically more or less the same film.Filmed in New York the production values are lavish &amp; it's well made, the only thing that dates it is that old style mobile phone no-one would be seen dead using these days. The acting is excellent from a great cast, Michael Douglas is great as the scheming cold blooded husband, Gwyneth Paltrow show's just enough vulnerability to be believable &amp; sympathetic, Viggo Mortensen plays it broadly &amp; you never quite know whether he would prefer the money or the girl while David Suchet is wasted in a very small role.A Perfect Murder is a really good suspense thriller with great performances &amp; a good plot, I wouldn't say it's better than than the original Dial M for Murder but I wouldn't say it's worse either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow, why did they ruin a gem like this. I think thats what most of the people who have seen this movie will say.What went wrong? Well, the movie starts out pretty good. Immediately there is a certain tense in it, when Michael Douglas pops up a few times, and you're wondering if he knows his wife has a new lover. After that the movie goes in a faster pace, and reaches very high levels. At that time, I was amazed about the script. It was really magnificent. Every time I got really surprised with totally unexpected things happening. Nothing wrong until now.Then finally, the film makes a crucial mistake regarding the end. The end of every movie is one of the most important things, A part that can make or break a movie. Well in this case, the end totally breaks / ruins the movie.WARNING: ***SPOILER***I thought the movie ended when Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow (the married couple) planned a dinner, Douglas went to the shower, and they would live happily ever after, without Paltrow finding out that her husband Douglas did plan to murder her, and with him being relieved that nobody knows what the hell he did, and the fact that his wife Paltrow is devoted to him again.But then, it was a shock for me, that the movie continued for several minutes, in which Paltrow finds the tape with the evidence that Douglas planned the whole murder attempt. Then she kills him after some stupid fight between them.The end degrades the movie. Without the end I would have rated it 9 out of 10, but sadly it has this end so I rate it a 7 out of 10, and it suddenly isnt one of my alltime favorites.What an end can do ......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder" was a movie to be remembered, but this remake was a disappointment. It had real potential, and would have been great, had they taken advantage of David Suchet's great acting ability, and his character, which was a central character in the original film. But instead, they relegated his character to the background, and then, to and insult to injury, changed the Hitchcock ending from a sizzle, to a fizzle. Worth seeing, but nothing compared to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Than Just A Remake Of An Old Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stylish 90's thriller about a love triangle that turns murderous was based on Frederick Knott's play "Dial M For Murder" (which was also the inspiration for Alfred Hitchcock's movie of the same name). Patrick Smith Kelly's screenplay updates the action, relocates it from London to New York and features enough plot twists to keep most viewers fully engaged throughout. The interactions between the characters at the centre of the story involve a toxic mixture of jealousy, lust, deception and blackmail which inevitably adds to the tensions which exist between them right from the very start.Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is a wealthy Wall Street trader with an unfaithful wife and an investment portfolio which is losing its value so fast that financial ruin seems to be a certainty. In order to deal with these problems he meticulously devises a complex and seemingly perfect plan to murder his wife so that he can solve his financial problems when he inherits his share of her $100 million fortune.Steven's wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) has for some time been having an affair with a struggling artist called David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) who Steven visits at his loft studio. Having already researched David's background and discovered that he's actually an ex-convict with a track record of being involved in scams in which rich women were his victims; Steven blackmails him into carrying out the planned murder for $500,000 in cash.When things don't work out as planned, Steven moves quickly to cover up what's happened, David tries to blackmail Steven because he has some incriminating evidence of his involvement in the murder plot and Emily gradually starts to realise what her husband's been attempting to do.One of the strengths of this movie is the brilliant casting as Michael Douglas is perfect as the cold and ruthless Steven, Gwyneth Paltrow portrays Emily's natural elegance, refinement and vulnerability convincingly and Viggo Mortensen looks suitably bohemian and at various times shows the mild amusement that David derives from what he does. These three characters all have their secrets as Emily doesn't tell Steven about her affair, he doesn't tell her about his financial problems and David doesn't mention his multiple identities, his criminal record or his background as a con artist."A Perfect Murder" isn't as stagy or as claustrophobic as Hitchcock's movie and the new elements which have been added really work well and make the plot more interesting. A wonderfully moody atmosphere is created and maintained throughout the film and some of the remarks made by the characters make a great impact. Examples of this are when Steven and Emily both say at different times "what if there were no tomorrow?" and "that's not happiness to see me, is it?".It's easy to see why "A Perfect Murder" was such a commercial success because it's actually a great deal more than just a simple remake of a well known movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Suchet as "Mo" Should Have His Own Series</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just read a story in Reuters(1/25/07) about Muslims being portrayed negatively in Western media, esp. movies, t.v., etc.. David Suchet's portrayal of Mo (Muhammed) in "A Perfect Murder" is just the sort of thing to offset that entirely accurate characterization of Western entertainment: A Muslim immigrant, who becomes a NYPD homicide detective... The series could just be called "Mo". Catchy... Suchet is an actor possessed of immense gravitas (esp in this role). He, famously, played another detective: "Poirot", of Agatha Christie fame. Naturally, the character he would play in the "Mo" series would be almost the direct opposite of Poirot, at least in terms of bearing. But imagining him in the role shouldn't be too tough -- we already have a "A Perfect Murder" which shows he can do it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three problems with this picture :1. A loose remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M For Murder" 2. Michael Douglas is directed horribly in some scenes 3. Poor dialogue at timesDial M For Murder is better of the 2, but this isn't bad, just not directed very well by a goodish director. Firstly, the framing is off at times, resulting in poor editing which the picture didn't need. 2 characters can fit in one frame without resorting to close-ups which add no emotions to the characters.Michael Douglas's performance wasn't good at all in some scenes, a face expression can say a 1000 words. He practically gave away clues to the police just by unconvincing expressions on his face. This is the director's fault!Andrew Davis can produce better than this. I didn't feel anything for any of the characters.The twists try to shake off Hitchcock's original, but at times it becomes sloppy. The finale is extremely disappointing, very tried and so damn boring!I watched this in aspect ratio 1.78:1 (16:9).Average, but not horrid. I can't say too much just in case you haven't seen it :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why the extra violence? Why the detective?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hitchcock's version was very stagebound, and, except for the assault on Grace Kelly, practically a drawing room mystery. This one adds two more, including one seemingly necessary to create a closure.Why does the movie go to the trouble of creating Detective Karamor (David Suchet), the archetypical intrepid investigator, then leave the necessary detective and confrontation work to Emily? His sole function seems to be to let Emily know about the missing key. Even his work with the phone records has holes in it - the police should have been able to trace the call to a cell phone and found some details. Knowing that the call came from an unregistered or falsely registered phone should have raised suspicion about the nature of the attack.</fullReview>

She's an aide to UN Ambassador Alice Wills and having an affair with painter David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). Steven suspects her infidelity and is in dire financial trouble. He also discovers that David is con man named Winston Lagrange and offers him $500k to kill his wife. After the break-in, police detective Mohamed Karaman (David Suchet) investigates.In the original, Alfred Hitchcock is able to create some limited sympathy for Grace Kelly by making her a blackmail victim. There is no such feelings for Gwyneth Paltrow. Also David Shaw is a con man in this version so there is no likability for the cheating couple. Douglas is a great slick puppet master but I don't really care about these people. It's great to have Douglas slithering across the screen but director Andrew Davis is unable to generated the needed tension or thrills.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All clean, slick, and shiny on the surface, the Marriage between this filthy rich Couple is only cosmetic. Neither is happy and just below the surface, but not far enough, the sense is that something bad is going to happen in the next two hours.In the first Scene there is something bad happening, Adultery, but that's neither here nor there. Money is the thing. Having it, not having it, having it but wanting more and so on. So there is Murder afoot. A not so perfect Murder as it turns out and then things become somewhat interesting with twists and turns.It is these twists that keep this melancholy affair from falling asleep to just drowsiness. The Villain keeps things awake with some diabolical scheming against these spoiled Upper Crust types and it is He who garners the most attention. Mostly because Mr. and Mrs. La-Dee-Da are as dull as dishwater. So this ends up being a tepid Movie when it could have been scalding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick With Hitch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder is a remake of the famous Alfred Hitchcock classic Dial M For Murder with Michael Douglas, Gwynneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortenson, and David Suchet cast in the roles that Ray Milland, Grace Kelly, Bob Cummings, and John Williams played in the original. From a nice set piece English crime story, it's now in late 20th century America where Douglas is doing another version of Gordon Gekko.Though Douglas might have made his own money like Gekko in this film he marries a lot more of it in Paltrow and his own financial empire is crashing around him. He needs unfettered control of her cash flow and this is the way to do it. And poor Paltrow admits during the course of the film she didn't sign a pre-nuptial agreement. Foolish woman.The biggest change is in the Cummings role. Viggo Mortenson is not a strong shoulder to cry on like Bob Cummings was for Grace Kelly. No he's part of Douglas's scheme though how I won't reveal.What I liked about Dial M For Murder was that it was not a whodunit. It was will the police put it together and free Grace Kelly. And instead of one gruesome murder we get a few of them here.No complaints about any of the players, but I'd stick with Hitch.</fullReview>

Viggo mortenson was superb in hidalgo and gweneth paltro was hard to beat in a movie where she was a flight attendant whose test was stolen. she had to live in some dump like cleveland as a result. quite frankly, this is primarily a film that focuses on the aspect of the female as a serial killer. first she takes down viggo and later she is given a chance to run away from her husband but instead makes a mockery of his attempt to hire someone to kill her and then she pulls a gun on him and proceeds to kill him. this was actually better than monster and i believe most people that watched this film and even the people that made it did not really notice that it was in reality about the notion that female's are just as adept at killing their fellow humans as their male counterparts.</fullReview>

While that film was more of a play than a movie, this tells the story of a wealthy New York commodities trader, his trophy wife, and the painter that she is cheating on her husband with. The Upper East Side of New York looks beautiful, and the actors are all good, including Douglas, whose character is a late 90's update of Wall Street's Gordon Gekko. However, the plot twists toward a tired and obvious conclusion. This one had me until the last ten minutes.Vote: 6</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** You see right away that their marriage is a bit strained within the first few minutes of the movie as Steven and Emily Taylor, Michael Douglas &amp; Gwyneth Paltrow, get ready to attend a by invitation only art exhibit at the New York Museum of Art. At the museum Emily makes eye contact with young starving and soon to become famous, or so he hopes, young artist David Shaw, Viggo Mortensen. You knows right away that she and him have got something going between each other and that the cheated on husband Steven, who's nobody's fool, knows that as well.Emily and David we find are madly in love with each other but Emily finds it much too hard to tell Steven and thus have the marriage dissolved. Keeping her affair with David secret Emily goes to his loft in Greenpoint Brooklyn every chance that she has and spends the day making out with him until Steven, a bond and currency broker on Wall Street, comes back home from a hard day's work at the office.Giving David a call, he got his phone number at the exhibit, Steven invites him over to a downtown bar to talk over his art work. To David's surprise, when he and Steven go to his loft to check it out, he's hit with the fact that Steven not only knows what's going on between him and Emily but also knows that David is an impostor! It turns out that David is on the lamb from the police for fleecing a number of rich and naive women of their life savings. Having been already convicted and sentenced to long prison terms for fraud and embezzlement the third time around would put David away for at least 15 years with no chance of parole. On top of all that Steven got the self-styled Casanova by the you know what with a photo that identifies him as the person who gypped a woman out of her savings. This information that David has, if it lead lead to a trial and conviction, would be David's third strike as well as a 15 year sentence behind bars.Just when you think that you got an idea of where the movie is going with Steven breaking up the love affair between the young artist and his wife Emily he completely surprises you by offering David $500,000.00 to not just get of of his and Emily's life but to murder her! We soon learn that Steven is not at all that interested in whom his wife is sleeping with but in her 100 million dollar trust fund that he's to inherited if anything bad, like Emily losing her life, happens to her. Having been involved in a number of wild and very speculative trading ventures on Wall Street Steven's firm is about to go bust with him heavily leveraged in playing the currency and bond markets with the banks leaving him, the once billionaire Wall Street whiz kid, almost penniless.The plan to do in Emily that Steven devises with a very reluctant David is to make it look like she was surprised by a burglar who then killed her and took of with nothing more then the key to her and Stevens suite that he would provide for him. David who's to do all the dirty work acting as the burglar while Steven, providing a perfect alibi for himself in his wife's murder, is away playing cards with his Wall Sreet friends on the other side of town. The almost perfect plan backfires when Emily not only survives it by killing the intruder, after a life and death struggle, with a oven thermometer but, this is what really blew Steven's as well as everyone watching the movies mind, the dead man turns out not to be David Shaw!Very well done murder drama/thriller that has the slick and crafty Steven Taylor get outmaneuvered by the person whom he tries to manipulate David Shaw. David in no time at all has all the cards to put Steven not just out of business, as a Wall Street broker, but behind bars as well for attempted murder of his wife Emily. Emily for her part is completely ignorant of what Steven had planned for her. It's not until Emily realizes with the help of Turkish/American NYPD detective in charge of the killing Mohamed Karaman,David Suchet, that the key that's on her key-chain, that Steven hastily put on it, is actually that of the dead burglars, Roland Gibbs, Washington Heights apartment. Emily and Moe or Mohamed somehow secretly bond together during the rest of the movie "A Perfect Murder" with her knowing Turkish and speaking to Moe in his native language.It takes a while for Emily to realize just what Steven is up to and by the time she finally get's it all together with the mystery of how her missing house key that the sparks and bullets really start to fly in the movies very tense and edge of your seat final sequence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Disappointing Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Perfect Murder" is an admirable attempt to remake Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder", an excellent, but often overlooked work. Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen all produce solid performances; this film is limited by its plot. The screenwriters were faced with the unenviable task of attempting to improve an immensely clever and complex script. "Dial M" deserves credit as a great thriller because of the layers in the plot, which require the viewer to think. These layers in the Hitchcock version are absent in Andrew Davis' version. Davis adds a new twist of his own, but it is not enough to make up for the missing elements of the original story. Finally, John Williams steals the show in "Dial M" with his outstanding performance as the inspector. David Suchet, whose portrayal of Hercule Poirot in the Agatha Christie film series models Williams' inspector, is given no such opportunity to shine in this film. All in all, "A Perfect Murder" is a decent film, but does not fall anywhere near the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i liked the original movie, and i sat down to watch this one with my girlfriend (who had not seen it) figuring i could discuss a few of the things that were in the original film.therein lies the problem of this film. instead of trying to be a stand alone film that used the same basic plot and characters, it tries to reconcile too many things with the original. the worst part of this was with the role of the police detective.of course, that may just be for 'pc' reasons, as grace kelly was more of a victim until she was saved, yet our spanish speaking ms. paltrow does all the case solving by herself. the whole language thing reminded me of a cheesy action show where we know 'that is going to come in handy later'.michael douglas was briefly a suspect, but given the circumstances i think the police would have investigated more.SPOILER WARNINGi somewhat disliked the ending of this. while douglas was certainly no good for trying to kill his wife, she is made to be almost heroic for offing him. maybe it was because things were less graphic when the original was made, but i always felt like grace kelly was not having an ongoing affair in that film like paltrow. from the way the film looked, douglass was happy to have his wife back and it could have had a creepy they are together but she'll never know ending. instead, she kills him. was her homocide at the end really justifiable? yet she is painted in a sympathetic light.entertaining, but not a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They hacked-up "Dial-M for Murder" to come up with this?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched "A Perfect Murder" on video, right after viewing Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder". I don't know if this immediate comparison affected me, but I did not like the remake. Hitchcock's original is very tightly plotted but plausible. Its only drawback ? it feels a lot like a filmed theatre play. To a certain extent that is because it is based on a play, and also because it was filmed on 3-d ? back when it was made 3-d cameras were the size of a small van and it was almost impossible to move the camera around to shoot from different angles etc. ? hence the "static" appearance."A Perfect Murder" has kept parts of the Hitchcock plot and has updated others, with catastrophic results. Readers who have seen "Dial M for Murder" will remember that a key played a vital role in the plot and eventually gave the whole business away. The new film retains the "key" which is odd since the Douglas/Paltrow household has an incredibly "high-tec" atmosphere (one would have expected at least a coded card). Yet, through one of the alterations introduced into the plot, it removes the need for the key! In "Dial M for Murder" Grace Kelly does not know the intended murderer and would never let him into the house. Hence the need for the murderer to let himself in using a key provided by her husband. But in "A Perfect Murder" Gwynneth Paltrow knows the intended murderer, and would welcome him into the house with open arms (well, literally!). So, why does the murderer need a key?Another one: In the original the husband has to make a phone call at a given time to wake up his wife (Grace Kelly) who will come to the phone to answer it and will then be attacked by the murderer. Now, this is plausible for 1950s England ? one telephone in the house, set on a table in the living room, so Grace Kelly has to get out of bed to answer it. Bedroom extensions weren't exactly standard equipment then. But the same device is employed in the remake ? Except this time Gwynneth Paltrow has to get out of the bath to answer the telephone (in the kitchen), and thus be attacked by the murderer. Do they really expect us to believe that multi-millionaire Gwynneth really would have had to get out of her bath to answer the telephone? Wouldn't her mega-bucks buy a portable, or a bathroom-extension, or at least an answering machine?Silly things like that annoyed me in this movie ? along with Gwynneth Paltrow's "showing-off" her supposedly incredible fluency in Arabic ( ! ) and Spanish ? for no apparent reason at all! All in all, and taken on its own the film is an indifferent but not altogether bad thriller. But I really don't see the point of picking on an old Hitchcock and mutilating its plot (ostensibly to "modernise" it) only to come up with this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless remake... as so many of them.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood, striving for riskless commercial success, has constantly embraced the practice of the remake. Sometimes is the unspoken remake of a foreign (with a particular predilection for French) films (a la "Point of No return"), sometimes a boasted remake, with the mandatory multi-million dollars special effects, of a domestic product (a la "Psycho"). More often than not, we are in the presence of a purely commercial operation, with no artistic of cultural justifications (there are, of course, exceptions, but oh-so preciously few).This mediocre thriller is no exception. The plot is (ex hypothesis) deja vu. The film fails completely to capture the atmosphere of Hitchcock's masterpiece.A final, semi-sociological note. In the original film (as in many films at the time), the villain is arrested. In this version (as in many films today) the villain is killed. We have seen the killing of the villain so often that it has risen to the status of a stereotype. I am not sure what conclusions we should draw about the "vigilante" attitudes of the 90's, but, for sure, it doesn't say anything good.Don't waste your time with this movie. Go at your local video store and rent "Dial M for Murder." You will have a much better time.</fullReview>

It would just keep on ringing, without any answering machine to pick it up. Therefore Gwyneth couldn't use any other lines.*SPOILER*One other question, though. Why do the police rule out Douglas as a suspect just because he made a phone call. The guys at the card game would be a much better alibi if it came to that. Gwyneth is saying to the police that she is suspecting Douglas to have hired a man to kill her, but the inspector brushes her off with the comment,that he couldn't have done that, because he was on the phone around 10 o clock...

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:This remake of Dial M For Murder I have always liked. Even though I am a big Hitch fan, Dial M was just too talky for me. The English detective prattles on and on, I found it boring. Douglas is the star here, he is quite an enigma when we first meet him. Though he is a businessman, there is none of the Gordon Gekko effusiveness; he is a walking iceberg here. This is just how a sociopath should be written, like Bridges in Jagged Edge. He discovers his wife is having fun with Viggo and hires him, behind her back, to kill her when he is at his card game. There are the parallels with Dial M: the meticulously planned out key deception, the timed phone calls, the ambush behind the curtain. Be warned, this is much more violent than the Grace Kelly version. The unraveling of the plot is actually the part of the remake that is superior. Viggo thinks that Douglas is the typical rich slime who is too cowardly to do his own killing; suffice to say, this was his fatal mistake. I won't spoil it for you but actually Viggo's killing is the scariest scene in the movie for it is unexpected unlike his wife's killing. The point of attack on this movie was the lack of chemistry between Paltrow and Douglas. The papers were filled with how it was in her contract that he was not allowed to kiss her. It must be true for he only kisses her cheek which renders the movie a trifle odd since they are supposed to be man and wife. Also, the age difference between the two is quite salient. The two factors together: the odd lack of intimacy coupled with her being a daughter's age rather than his contemporary gave the movie its biggest weakness: a lack of realism. Suchet's version of an Arabic detective, while meritorious, seemed too politically correct to many viewers; it never bothered me, Suchet is an excellent actor. I found this version to be, thankfully, much faster moving with less eternal chit / chat like Dial M. Douglas gives an excellent performance, many hated the ending, I thought it was quite suspenseful. It is clear the director is channeling Jagged Edge with the 'surprise discovery' that was the highlight of that movie. For all of its flaws, Douglas and Viggo are excellent. Paltrow is not my favorite (Johansson) but she is capable here. The best way to review it for you is to ask yourself how much you liked Dial M? It is faster moving and much more violent but it is, at its core, the same movie over again. Like Dial M, many viewers got lost with the intricate key swapping part of the murder plot. For me, it is a step down in acting but a big step up in intensity. Douglas is downright creepy here, cold as ice; there are a few scenes where he pops out behind her that provoked gasps and screams when I saw this in the theater. Just do not go into it expecting passionate chemistry between Douglas and Paltrow. She has some with Viggo but with her supposed husband it is rather awkward and cold. This was attacked after the movie did not do so well, I read Douglas thought her silly contract demand damaged the movie: I tend to agree with him. It starts right away with his discovery of her affair, there is far less setup than in Dial M. The stars of the movie are the pacing and intensity with a drop off in acting ability besides Douglas. Suchet's detective does give Patrow's character a needed warmth to compensate for her coldness with Douglas. Not That Bad Of A Movie. Q.E.D.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting In Parts, But Douglas is Tops!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A modern remake of Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 film Dial M for Murder, 'A Perfect Murder' has some absorbing moments and yet it never convinces you entirely. Its definitely interesting in parts &amp; Michael Douglas is unmatchable, but the Writing isn't always arresting.'A Perfect Murder' Synopsis: Millionaire industrialist Steven Taylor (A Stellar Michael Douglas) is a man who has everything but what he craves most: the love and fidelity of his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow). A hugely successful player in the New York financial world, he considers her to be his most treasured acquisition. But she needs more than simply the role of dazzling accessory. Brilliant in her own right, she works at the U.N. and is involved with a struggling artist (Viggo Mortensen) who fulfills her emotional needs. When her husband discovers her indiscretion, he sets out to commit the perfect murder. 'A Perfect Murder' begins well, but stumbles in the middle, and picks up for a fantabulous culmination. There's no denying there's true merit in here, but the sequences once after the husband decides to kill his wife, fall flat. Its only when things get darker, towards the end, that things pick up rapidly. Its an erratic film, that switches between being gripping &amp; flat.Patrick Smith Kelly's Adapted Screenplay is a mixed-bag. Its convincing in parts, but falls short otherwise. A little more edgier middle, would've done wonders. Andrew Davis's Direction credits a special mention. He's handled the film really well. Dariusz Wolski's Cinematography is perfect. Dennis Virkler &amp; Dov Hoenig's Editing is mostly sharp. Art &amp; Costume Design are superb. Make-Up, too, is well-done.Performance-Wise: Douglas is delightfully menacing. Right from his piercing eyes, to his husky voice, &amp; his volatile body-language, The Hollywood Legend steals the show. Gwyneth Paltrow looks lanky, but enacts her part well. Viggo Mortensen could've been stronger, but he gets limited scope, one of the reasons, why he doesn't stand out. David Suchet is first-rate.On the whole, 'A Perfect Murder' appeals in parts. Watch it for Douglas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As with all of Michael Douglas's films, this one is brilliant and amazingly acted. It's a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder," but done very well. The movie suffers not in the least when compared to Hitch's version. If anything, it's a better picture. It obviously had a bigger budget. It's not nearly as mannered and static. The plot has been extensively updated, except for one key scene involving a telephone. Its failings are due to the same elements which bothered Hitch. The play is close to being a potboiler. Still, in the new version, the makers were smart enough to employ film techniques which tend to gloss over the script's weaknesses.Michael Douglas plays a great role as a stern, hard businessman. I have to admit that he is almost sexy in his portrayal. Gwyneth Paltrow seems comfortable in her role as a victimized heiress. Viggo Mortensen makes a good grungy artist. And David Suchet of Inspector Poirot is an excellent actor. We get to see him without the mustache. Actually, this is the type of movie that lends itself to being just a short play since most of the action takes place in just two apartments. The movie is set in New York city, and the director manages to work in a few local attractions such as Penn Station, the Staten Island Ferry, some skylines, and some museums. But the New York scenes are just a bonus, like icing on a cake, and the movie really hangs on the stars and their interactions. It is a good drama with some surprising turns.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

I've since seen it several times and still find it very entertaining and a movie with excellent acting from Michael Douglas, Gwenyth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen. The film even has Mr. Hercule Poirot alias David Suchet, as an intense police investigator. Can you ask for more?This is an old fashioned thriller, with a dark storyline, with some unexpected turns. I do not want to give anything away. Don't read reviews with spoilers, if you intend to see it. As you have guessed by now, I really recommend this movie. See it if you enjoy thorough films, with great acting and a story that never never bores you. Get the popcorn ready - and enjoy.

		<shortDescription>Not "perfect" but a better thriller than I was expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was better than I was expecting it to be, full of twists and turns and holding a decent level of suspense throughout. Admittedly I never really bought into the idea of Michael Douglas being married to Gweneth Paltrow but they both did a great job. Douglas plays (another) wealthy executive type here, who learns that his wife is having an affair with a struggling artist and then offers the (very young and probably for the time not well known) Viggo Mortensen half a million dollars to murder her. The plan should have been "perfect" but....This is apparently a remake of the Alfred Hitchcock classic 'Dial M for Murder'(1954) which I'm curious to see now, and a slick little thriller in its own right, as I wasn't ever sure where it was going to go what with everybody betraying everybody. Good plot.I also really enjoyed David Suchet in a small role as the detective, piecing it all together. I was left wondering at the end though if "David" really loved her or not? On that note Olivier Martinez played almost exactly the same character in Unfaithful -a somewhat tortured, sexy, bohemian, struggling artist. They even looked similar 10/4/15</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An imperfect murder remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder is a remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder, a story where U.N. worker Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with struggling artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), as her husband, Steven Taylor, hasn't been there for her emotionally. When Steven finds out, he seeks to commit the perfect murder to inherit her fortune.While a remake, this is still a fresh story with additional plot elements and characters, and surprises that nobody saw coming. Director Andrew Davis kept the plot solid while not swaying too much away from the dignity of the original film, and your focus is still on the character development of the three lead characters. You will be left following and guessing at each of their motives.Michael Douglas made a controlling, cold-blooded and chilling portrayal of Steven Tyler, while Gwyneth Paltrow gave a determined and vulnerable portrayal of Emily Taylor. Viggo Mortensen sometimes came across as emotionless and oblivious in his portrayal of David Shaw and doesn't seemed to be too concerned in the events surrounding him. In addition, the second half of the film doesn't come across as quite as suspense-building or gripping as in the original film, particular the limited investigative elements from the detective in this film.But overall, it's still not bad thriller and is quite entertaining as a stand-alone film, remake or not.Grade B-</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have viewed this film several times and kept trying to think of what was it that bugged me so much about it. These kids are riding the wave of luxury and have servants (i.e. with keys) and access to a locksmith.Hence, one would presume the entire basis of this crime unravelling would NEVER be lack of an extra key. Well, well, well....guess the rich have to trim those corners and keep Mr. Red Line at bay.I was surprised that Ms. 80lbs Wet would just savor the thought of having an entire Pork Roast with veggies awaiting her salivating greedy chops. Guess who's coming to dinner cupcake? The saving grace of the film of course is our dear voluptuous Viggo. Although he keeps repeating lines, mumbles a lot and appears quite the patsy, I was able to force field my way to appreciate his muted performance. He has been around too long to have accepted this type of role but Mikey made him an offer he chewed on....haha.High recommend for Armenian(?) interactions, high seas romance, financial collapse and doom lovers, and good ol' stupidity!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder (1998): Dir: Andrew Davis / Cast: Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet, Sarita Choudhury: Remake of Dial M for Murder for no other purpose than to present steamy sex and graphic violence. Title indicates a need for proof in having done wrong. Michael Douglas plays a business person who knows that his wife is having an affair and blackmails her lover into murdering her. The concept still works and there is an excellent twist that allows this thriller to benefit from its cleverness. It also proves that director Andrew Davis was going for intelligence yet the film still lurks in the gutter of sex and gore. Davis previously made The Fugitive so he does not need gore over suspense especially since the Hitchcock film prevailed nicely without the use of graphic violence. Douglas is well cast as he struggles drastically to mend one problem only to cause greater ones until his deceit and crime catches up with him. Gwyneth Paltrow as the adulterous wife will survive the attack and make discoveries that render a standoff. Viggo Mortensen is the painter caught in adultery and forced into a crime but he isn't without resources. David Suchet as the police inspector is standard and flat. This is nowhere near as good as the Hitchcock classic, thanks to its desperate need for graphic violence. The result is a film that is slick and clever but far from perfect. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is said to be a re-make of Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder". I don't know how I have gone all these years without seeing the original, but somehow I have. Therefore I can make no comparisons between them. Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow, as always, turned in excellent performances. Viggo Mortensen wasn't bad either. A shout-out to Sarita Choudhury as well. Nice photography of New York City and environs. There was even a certain modicum of suspense maintained almost throughout. In short, I cannot quite put my finger on what this film's shortcomings are, but It was really just okay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Hitchcock's Version!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brilliant re-make of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder, starring the far more charismatic Michael Douglas in the Ray Milland role. This re- make's other leads don't quite match the sterling performances in Hitch's version, but Gwyneth Paltrow certainly gives the superbly cast Grace Kelly a close call. Anthony Dawson's role as the villain in the 1954 version has been considerably expanded and re-written, so it is a little unfair to say that Viggo Mortensen gives the better account. Let's just say that, in my opinion, Mortensen should have given us at least a few subtle indications of his real character right from the start. Instead, either he or director Andrew Davis have chosen to play the role vigorously, but straight. An opportunity missed! But nevertheless, A Perfect Murder certainly does come across with enough suspenseful twists and turns to keep all eyes riveted on the screen from opening to close. And, as said above, Michael Douglas is superb! Available on an excellent Warner Brothers DVD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It is actually a decent thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A perfect murder is pretty much an update version with many changes of the original classic Dial M for Murder. Obviously this film is not quite as successful as the original film, but its still nevertheless a pretty decent and interesting thriller, that has lots of twists and turns. The story is basically about a husband and wife named Steven (Michael Douglas) and Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) where despite being married and have high prolific careers, are having a troublesome relationship and various other issues in their lives. Emily (Gwyneth) is having an affair with someone, Steven (Michael) is having serious financial implications. Neither of them are mentally stable, yet have various 'targets' to achieve. The film is pretty good for what it was. Michael Douglas was the outstanding performer of this film and if not for his performance, then I just feel the film would've dropped way down to mediocrity. I'm surprised just how beautiful Gwyneth looked back then, she was a very good choice playing the character Emily. The cast choice was good and the film is a decent thriller worth watching for 1 night or something at least. The conclusion according to me was a let down otherwise it could've got a higher rating.Personally, I found this film pretty enjoyable and gave it a 6 rating and it is certainly worth watching. What makes the film different compared to Dial M for Murder, is that it is much much darker.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler Ahead! I really can't understand how anyone could have liked this movie. It was a tired story and poor in execution from start to finish. The only redeeming value was in the three principal performances which were great but not nearly enough to bail out this sinking ship of a thriller.First of all, if the artist David Shaw had as much talent as reported in the movie and he had a huge loft in NY he wouldn't have to lie about his past and he would have rich women lining up to have affairs with him. And $400,000 for a killing? He could make that on one over-rated painting if he sold it to some chump socialite.The big problem I have with films of this ilk is that they just aren't nearly as clever as they assume to be. Steven Taylor could have found a lot less complicated way to kill his wife for her money and by involving a known criminal in the mix all he does is throw in a lot more loose?and unreliable?ends.The final death struggle was preposterous. The guy had already attempted to kill her yet she confronts him alone in their apartment? Why not just invite him down into the unlit cellar instead? And then we have the ridiculously cliché dead-but-not-really-dead bad guy who gets yet one more chance to do her in. This tripe seems to be written by people who do nothing but watch crappy movies.Profoundly mediocre at its core.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated because it's a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna give it a 9, to fix a bit the bad IMDb score. I think this movie is underrated - in my opinion mainly because it's a remake of a Hitchcock classic. People think that "No one should mess with Hitchcock, because they are going to just fail compared to him". This may be true, but I think this movie is underrated. For starters, it does not have the same plot - not even close. There are many surprises for people who have seen the original Hitch movie. In fact, they are essentially a different movie, the main plot line is very different. Only the theme is similar. It has also very good acting by three of the main actors, plus lot of suspense. It kept me on the edge of my seat until the very end. This comes from a person who has seen the original Hitchcock movie dozen of times. People shouldn't rate movies badly, because they are remakes (or sequels). If they bring something new to the table, they are justified. You don't have to reinvent the wheel every time, composers and musicians take influences from old music all the time, then they add SOMETHING new, but something in hit songs is always familiar and done before. Having influences is not necessarily a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Andrew Davis directed one of my all time favorite films, "The Fugitive", a film where everything seems to work, from its thrilling plot to the interplay among the various actors. It's a great ride. In "A Perfect Murder", a premise is revisited, and an attempt is made to come up with a fresh perspective on "Dial M for Murder". To reveal the new twists would be murder.The casting is very interesting, with Michael Douglas leading the cast as the not-so-loving husband, someone who might have definite plans on how to improve his current situation. He is suave, sophisticated, and plays the charming businessman very well; yet there is something about him that sets off alarms when you look closely. He's married to a wealthy socialite, a woman who is worth more than we'll ever see in our lifetime. She's cultured, kind, beautiful, but no quite a perfect human being. As we soon discover, she is involved in a relationship that might be too dangerous for her.Things become complicated as the parties start interacting with each other, and new motives and machinations arise. It's like a chess game, and it's at this point that we go back to the original source and have to admire what Davis attempts to do. He has updated the original premise, giving more depth to the husband and wife's roles. It's hard not see the differences between both movies' leading ladies, but Paltrow does a fine job portraying the damsel in distress. The film gives this character to show a side we never saw in Grace Kelly's portrayal. It is more than a representation of the social particulars of an era. It's a different, better character because it goes deeper than its surface.If you think that seeing the original will spoil this entry, be ready to find a couple of new twists here, and they seem to improve the plot. Is the new film better than the original? That will up to the individual viewer to decide. What "A Perfect Murder" delivers is a fun, thrilling two-hour ride. Enjoy it.</fullReview>

Unable to commit the crime, he gets someone else to do it. That person is promptly killed by Paltrow in a violent struggle. The movie then becomes one of intrigue, blackmail, deceit and all other forms of treachery.Douglas is excellent as the intellectual, cunning husband whose plans ultimately do him in. He is equally matched by Paltrow, worth $100 million who is his equal. As the artist, Mortensen is sly, too sly for his own good.Hell hath no fury for both a husband and wife scorned.

		<shortDescription>A Imperfect Movie but I liked it anyway</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this movie and watch it whenever it's on TV. I fell for Gwyneth's innocent, delicate vulnerability even though she's having an affair. She reminds me of Audrey Hepburn in Charade where there is something appealing about a classy yet helpless woman in distress.The scene where she goes to the apartment of the man she killed to see if the key fits located in the ghetto accentuates her vulnerability. Angelina Jolie wouldn't work as well in that situation as she much stronger.However, It was absurd that the same type of key that went with a luxury apartment would also be the same quality as one used in a tenement. I replaced a lock on my front door with a high priced one and the new key doesn't bend like the cheap one that came with the house. Really? Michael Douglas is so satisfying to hate in a movie. What a creep. Yet, I was on his side in Disclosure with Demi Moore.Two characters that really filled out the cast well for me were David Suchet as the detective and his gentleness with Paltrow was reassuring. Suchet has an appearance that could pass as a bad guy or a terrorist yet the actor was able to communicate caring and trust which says a lot about him. I felt the same way about Michael P. Moran who informed Paltrow of her husband's shady business practices. He looks familiar but I don't know from where and I liked him.Viggo was an unpleasant character and I didn't much mind his demise.For a slight, delicate woman, Paltrow's character dispatched, directly or indirectly, 3 men in this movie. Not bad for a non-superwoman.</fullReview>

It is a great calm mystery that never gets you bored.

		<fullReview>I hate to say it but I found myself wanting to help Michael Douglas cover up his crime. I kept saying to myself, "Yeah, that's a good excuse." That's pretty sick. Of course, you set this up with this clutching corporate bastard stereotype, messing up his marriage by controlling every aspect of it. Gwyneth is his wife (couldn't get much better than that) but he runs the house like the business and soon she is in bed with Viggo Mortenson, who is himself a small time crook. Douglas, wanting to control even more, decides to kill her off and the fun begins. This, of course, is Dial M for Murder where Grace Kelley becomes the potential victim (give me your rejects, please!). Douglas is about as cold as a man can be; Mortenson is artistic one moment and dumb the next. Things get a little uneven at times, and if one thinks too much, it could fall apart just a bit. But just like the first film, it's suspenseful and captivating. One character who is wasted is David Souchet, who played Hercule Poroit on those PBS Mystery things. There is a hint of a connection made between the Paltrow character and his, but it is never capitalized upon. In the original, I remember his associated character being a much greater part of the movie. This would have helped a great deal, especially at the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoy for performances, action -- overlooking plot "holes"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Michael Douglas is, personally, my favorite actor. He is believable playing the macho "horse's ass" (here as a wealthy, cold international securities/currencies speculator, as the corporate raider in "Wall Street," and as the displaced lower-level defense worker in "Falling Down"). He's equally adept in his roles as the engaging character, whether as an adventurer in "Romancing the Stone," or the unbelievably-likable President in "The American President" (in the latter, handsome, honest, intelligent, forthright, an outstanding father and boss -- IF ONLY!!).Viggo Mortensen can play smarmy, as well as more positive types, and performs well here. Gwyneth Paltrow is a bit too low-key and even laconic at times -- but hell, she's a young woman with wealthy parents who (according to info in the film) already has about a $100-mil, in her own right (with parents who seemingly have several times this amount, to come to her later).I don't think this movie is inferior to the original -- both well-represent the particular eras during which they were filmed. In the original, 1950's England, you could readily accept the perpetrator's and victim's door keys being alike, obviously from the same manufacturer. Plus, the original would-be killer was a middle-class type, not a slum lowlife as in this flick.Both films have some holes in the plot -- but this re-make has more than Swiss cheese. And for me, although the strategic point in the storyline, it seemed absolutely ludicrous that the would-be killer's key for a rattrap flat in the worst part of the city -- would be the same make, and in identical condition to that carried in the wealthy Paltrow's purse, and for what would be a security hardware array in her multi-million-dollar digs. In real life, just the door hardware in an apartment such as hers and Douglas' would cost more than the entire slum building where the criminal resided.But this is a film to be enjoyed -- in spite of these plot "holes."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought Gordon Gekko Married Sean Young?.......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Millionaire industrialist Steven Taylor is a man who has everything but what he craves most is the love and fidelity of his wife.A hugely successful player in the New York financial world, he considers her to be his most treasured acquisition.But she needs more than simply the role of dazzling accessory.Brilliant in her own right, she works at the U.N. and is involved with a struggling artist who fulfils her emotional needs.When her husband discovers her infidelity, he sets out to commit murder and inherit her considerable trust fund in the bargain.Back in the nineties, even though he is arguably brilliant, with the exception of Falling down, Douglas played the same character in every film he made.It's not a bad thing, but this movie should have simply been Wall Street 2, and Gekko has escaped from prison and wants his wife's money, wouldn't have been a remake to the Hitchcock classic and would have made more money.For what it's worth, it's still one of those glossy thrillers that were rife in the cinemas in the late nineties, all about money and power.Paltrow and Mortenson are very good, but what this film does ask, is who are 'you' rooting for? At times I must admit it was Douglas, because Paltrows character was introduced in the worse way possible, but then Douglas became more and more pantomime villain up until the predictable climax.The film isn't nothing special, Douglas owns the film as usual, and it's very flashy, and very expensive, but forgettable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was reading the other reviews and I found some of the comments interesting. Particularly about the plot holes and etc. Since editing cuts key scenes, it is virtually impossible to view a movie that does not lack continuity here and there.Also, I saw some striking similarities between A Perfect Murder and Dial M for Murder. One, both female protagonists were in loveless marriages with men who were unsuccessful in their professions. Both women were financially independent whose funds greatly exceeded their husbands. Both were intelligent, sensitive, extremely attractive and passionate. And for some reason (hmmmmm) chose not to divorce their husbands although they were clearly unhappy.In The Perfect Murder, the husband was on the brink of financial disaster. In Dial M for Murder, the husband was spending money "all over town," showing his lack of constraint and irresponsibility. Both male protagonists were overconfident egotists, prancing about like peacocks.I could go on and on because The Perfect Murder was very interesting on it's own and in comparison to the original version.I think it is work a viewing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Usually I am not big into remakes. I believe that each generation has people with talent that if given the chance would come up with great stories, therefore remakes would become a thing of the past. I am not a Hollywood type, and my two cents are not worth much only two cents. Yesterday was a cold late November evening. The movie was on television and I was amazed that I stayed up for the entire movie. It takes a movie that grabs my interest to make me stay up late these days. I enjoyed the movie very much. Michael Douglas (Wall Street), Gwyneth Paltrow (Bounce), Viggo Mortensen (Psycho) all did a wonderful job. They were believable. If you have the chance watch it! It reminded me some of the movie "Sleeping with the Enemy" with Julia Roberts (Erin Brockovich). My favorite quote: Steven:" When you wake up tomorrow, all this will seem like a bad dream." Emily: "What if there is no tomorrow?" Favorite Scene: The very last ones!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There are reasons why movies shouldn't be remade, this movie is why!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has always been something very tempting to do, to remake a successful film and hope to God that it'll be as successful as the previous. Unfortunately, it almost never happens and this film is no exception. Paltrow's acting talents are minimal, but she does her best to play the role of Emily Bradford. Her droopy eyed and unenergetic performance becomes static. On the other hand, Douglas saves the film with his usual panache and flair for playing the evil schemer. It is him and only him that saves this film. And who did the editing job on the film? My lord. There is an alternative ending on DVD, but I wouldn't waste my time on that. If you want to see this film, I suggest you go see the original, "Dial M for the Murder" with Grace Kelly. For those who have seen Hitchcock's classic, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The performances in this movie were so great! Michael Douglas has a way of pronouncing his lines that just ooze distrust, anger, or equivocation. Brilliant. Paltrow was utterly convincing as the disillusioned wife of a man that her family and friends thought was perfect for her. And Mortenson! How more exacting could an actor be at portraying sincerity to his lover and sleeze to the audience?However, there were two glaring errors. 1) Once it became obvious that her house key belonged to someone else (Paltrow learned it herself by letting herself into the assassin's apartment, and later her husband confirmed that he'd attached that key to her keychain), didn't she ask herself "How did he get in???" 2) Okay, Douglas' character established an airtight alibi by calling some kind of auto-responsive financial thing (don't ask me to go back and figure that out) on ONE of his cell phones, while calling his wife on the cell phone that he discarded on the street on his way home. But nobody then asked: Who was it that called her on the kitchen phone, bringing her from her bath?Still, it was an intriguing thriller that kept me watching. Trite ending aside, it's worth a second or third look for the performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Cares</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of the negative reviews here have it right. The main problem with Perfect Murder is that the only "good guy" around, Ms. Paltrow, is a two-timing wife whose excuse for hooking up with a low-rent artiste is that her husband is too controlling. Duh? You marry a fabulously wealthy commodity/currency trader and you expected a Woodstock personality? We may not be rooting for the missus to be bumped off but who cares much one way or the other? Contrast this to Dial M for Murder where Grace Kelly is a much more sympathetic character. The second problem with Perfect Murder is the profusion of gaping plot holes, the principal one being that the lover/artiste who Michael Douglas forces to do the killing in fact has no reason to do so since he taped the murder deliberations between himself and Douglas. He doesn't need to attempt a murder. He just needs to blackmail Douglas. This is what eventually happens and you have to wonder why it didn't happen in the first reel. David Suchet is essentially wasted as a suspicious NYC detective -- bolstering his role might have made this clunker a little more palatable. By the way, what kind of linguist is Paltrow's character anyway. She's apparently fluent in Arabic and Spanish and whatever the Yugoslavian delegate was speaking in the opening scene -- an odd combination. Perfect Murder is a fairly slick looking film but it's not a film to go out of the way for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The appeal here is not the plot of the movie itself but Micael Douglas playing a sociopath and Paltrow as the fragile, exploited wife. These two are so colorful and good in their roles that you sort of want to watch this and get into it, even though the movie isn't all that good. And it ISN'T. I could guess some of these plot twists from a mile away-and the typical movie way of beefing up suspense with scary music gets a bit old after awhile. Plus the end was just such a cliché. Normally, I hate movies like this. Although psychological thrillers are one of my favorite genres they have to have something special to them. I guess what this has is Paltrow and Douglass. They do well with a weak script and make you want to watch. I guess that is what good acting is all about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first watched this movie, I thought of it as a "remake" of Dial M for Murder. I thought that it was really bad, seeing as how it's a "remake". But, after I thought of it as the same theme with a similar story, I started liking it more. I actually saw this before I saw Dial M for Murder, but although this was a good story I still found the original better. The acting in A Perfect Murder was very good. It was much better than I would have ever expected. This movie can't even be compared to Alfred Hitchcock's 'Dial M for Murder'. It still has a good plot. But, I wouldn't think of it as a "remake" because I was stuck trying to compare the two movies together, and it made this movie look really bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much remake as ripoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never would've seen this film had it not been on television on a slow night. I LOVE Hitchcock and the idea of remaking his movies misses the point of his movies: they're not great because they were great stories, but because they were great films. This purported to be a 'remake' of 'Dial M for Murder,' a favourite Hitchcock of mine (mainly because I love Grace Kelly under his direction). It was with surprise, then, to find that really the only element to survive the update was that a fellow plans to have his wife murdered and it goes wrong. All else appears twisted and worse-than-modernised in this version, making this movie its own, as though a writer had written a VERY similar screenplay and it was only after shopping it around that someone pointed out its similarity to 'Dial M...' The performances in this rendition are utterly weak, a shame considering the leading cast. The direction, though colourful, is far too much for what is a simple murder mystery. Do yourself a favour and miss out on this one...go watch the original for a better -- though less SEXIFUL -- experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A PERFECT MURDER, in my opinion, is an excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat movie that's sort of like FATAL ATTRACTION, only it's about what can happen when your spouse has an affair. If you ask me, Steven (Michael Douglas) was a rather slimy fellow, sort of. It's hard for me to remember why off the top of my head. However, if you ask me, he and Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) looked very nice in the attire they wore to the play at the beginning of the movie. I really didn't like Emily's short hairdo, thought. Personally, I think Gwyneth Paltrow looks better with long hair. When she unknowingly stabbed David (Viggo Mortensen) in the side of his neck, I was really grossed out. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone involved did an outstanding job. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent, nail-biting, edge-of-your-seat movie that's sort of like FATAL ATTRACTION to all you Michael Douglas or Gwyneth Paltrow fans who haven't seen it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Imperfect murder would be more accurate</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Very predictable thriller that didn't introduce anything new at all.It's a story about a Steven(Michael Douglas) and Emily Taylor(Gwyneth Paltrow), a rich couple with marriage problems. Apparently Emily has been unfaithful for 6 months living in belief that her husband know nothing about her affair. Steven is well aware of it all and plans to have her killed inorder to save his business by inheriting her money. He hires her lover to commit the perfect crime. Her lover is their mutual aquaintance, an artist named David Shaw(Viggo Mortensen). He is a former convict and a known scoundrel. Steven offers David $500,000,00 for killing his wife, because he doesn't have the gutts for it. Neither does David but he takes the money anyway and agrees to kill Emily. He on the other hand hires an old friend to do it. But Steven's well thought masterplan goes all wrong and Emily kills the killer instead. The police begin to investigate the crime and naturally start to suspect Steven immediately. The rest is as predictable as it appears to be.Two things entirely ruin this movie, the huge plot-holes and the typical ending. Michael's performance is solid as usual but very similar to his roles in past. Almost identical with his character in the Game. For the first time we see Gwyneth in something else then a romantic flick and i pretty much think she should stay in that category even though she is a good actress and does a decent job in this movie. Viggo is a bad choice to play the part of David and we can see it clearly. But on the other hand his character is so poorly written and doesn't even reassemble an artist at all that i wont hold it against him.If you want to see a movie with very little suspense for a thriller and a terrible story with an even worse ending go and rent or buy this one. Otherwise pick up something else.</fullReview>

Love never entered the picture. They don't even like each other.Gwyneth's character is a multilingual genius in some scenes, but is easily duped by a two-bit con artist (Mortenson) and somehow got herself trapped in a hollow facade of a marriage to Steven (Douglas). Which is it? Is she smart or incredibly naive? The answer is whatever is convenient for the next page of the script.Steven's foolhardy plan to murder his wife is obviously doomed to failure.The painter/con artist knows right away he can take the 100,000 and run, but he knows he won't have to earn the remaining 400,000. He can just hire someone to commit the murder for him. For the younger viewers, I hope they don't think Hitchcock's movies were worse than this, just because they're not recently made. Rent any Hitchcock film and you won't be disappointed. I can't say the same for this turkey. A bad script, with no suspense. I can't give it more than a 3 (out of ten stars).</fullReview>

Her walk-in closet is a dream apartment all its own. When Douglas is showing the place to Mortensen it feels like real-estate tour. When the phone rings while she's in the tub, how can there not be phone in that room? I should expect to find a whole home-office in there.

		<shortDescription>Much Better Than The Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boy, here's one re-make I thought was far superior to the original. The latter was "Dial M For Murder," with Ray Milland, Grace Kelly and Bob Cummings. In this film, the stars are Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen.The best part of this film may not be the story, or the acting, both of which keep you glued to the screen, but the stylish photography and sets. They look magnificent, mainly the apartment of the the two leads. I was constantly awed by how good this film looks.I also prefer the sequel because it has more twists and is complex enough to thoroughly enjoy every 3-4 years. Also fun are the short speeches each character gives on occasion, usually when they smugly think they have the upper hand. Each time that happens, their antagonist winds up going one up on them! There isn't much action in here but when it occurs, it's very intense.I've viewed this movie four times and the only thing that annoys me - unfortunately it's a big one - is the ending in which I don't believe justice totally prevailed. I can't wrote much more without spoiling it for those who have not seen this. One of the parties comes out looking like a 'an innocent victim" and that person was hardly a "saint." If all the parties had received just due, it would have been more satisfying and I would have rated this a 10 for how entertaining it is to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I mean how seriously dare they? They - Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, Viggo Mortensen, David Suchet along with their director, should be on bended knees to the Master for this extraordinarily awful thriller, a so-called remake of the brilliant "Dial M for Murder".It was so full of plot holes that colanders would be envious. And so chronically full of the "Look, Ma, I'm acting!" genre of knuckle-dragging acting school rejects. Except for Michael Douglas. He's a hero for making the most of this drek of a script. He must have needed the money. I sure wasted mine in thinking anything with Michael Douglas would not be a waste of time. Even in the dusty footsteps of the great man himself.Wrong! 1 out of 10 for a Fail on every single level.Go get the original Hitchcock and see what real suspense and a tight script is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the original instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flaccid remake of Hitchcock's excellent thriller 'Dial M For Murder' dumps not only that great title but numerous chunks of the clever plot, and replaces them with twists of its own that are either predictable or old hat. Michael Douglas takes over from Ray Milland as a slimy rich chap married to unfaithful Gwyneth Paltrow; he blackmails her lover (Viggo Mortenson) into murdering her, but both his scheme and the movie go chronically wrong. The only good bits here are derived from the original play and Hitch's film, but it doesn't make a lot of difference as they're drowned in a stew of unnecessary additional scenes and needless peripheral characters. Possibly the most obvious blunder is that the murder set-up is far from perfect, although that's rivalled by silly plot holes like the one in which Douglas goes to Mortenson's apartment to retrieve his wife's wedding ring, thereby removing evidence of a connection between them, but neglects to do anything about the six-foot-wide painting OF HER FACE. An improvement on the original in no way whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a Diversion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a Hitchcock devotee but I regard 'Dial M for Murder' as one of his worst movies. It's tedious and lacks any of his usual refinement. No technique. No interesting toying with viewpoint. No camera-work. None of his usual motifs. It's a numbing, claustrophobic movie with a stagebound script that talks everything to death. A Perfect Murder, which has no great ambitions, is a good potboiler. It riffs on the plot of "Dial M" but goes far more interesting places. So I really don't understand the hate for the movie. There are plot holes... but I didn't really mind too much. The first big change to the story - which I will not reveal - is a terrific shocker. Other developments are wickedly sly (but there's also a very lame surprise entrance from Douglas on a train). It's worth a view. Its big flaw is that the last ten minutes aren't good enough, but at that point you've gotten more than you money's worth of cleverness.In every movie ever made about the art world or a rock band, I always dread the moment in which a bum line is voiced about either milieu. "Your anger is very controlled," is Douglas's dumb comment as he gazes at a painting here. Ugh. Horrible line.Viewers bemoaning that all the characters here are despicable are apparently unaware that, the likable protagonist formula they prefer is exhausted. Yeah , they're all shallow deeply flawed individuals... Who cares? it's a better than average popcorn movie. The movie also accomplishes the impossible: It's the only Gwyneth Paltrow movie where she isn't insufferable. Michael Douglas plays yet another one-dimensional slimeball.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a plot as perfect as the murder planned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steven (Michael Douglas) and Emily Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow) look like the typical rich New Yorkers: he's twice her age, they live in a high-rise, and both have prestigious jobs. But she doesn't know that he's planning to have her killed to pay off his debts. And he doesn't know that she's cleverer than he thinks."A Perfect Murder" does a very good job updating "Dial M for Murder". They keep the suspense going every step of the way. And they really pull some surprises. Equally as good as the aforementioned stars is Viggo Mortensen; he gives sort of an air of Aragorn's bad side. But either way, this is certainly a movie that I recommend. Also starring Sarita Choudhury.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know this movie was a remake of a Hitchcock classic until I saw it here on the website. Perhaps it's only for the best that I didn't know it when watching the movie, because willing or not, I would automatically compare it to the original.Even though this movie isn't a Hitchcock, I still had a very good time watching it. I liked Michael Douglas as the seemingly perfect husband who finds out that his rich and younger wife (Paltrow) is cheating on him with a poor painter (Viggo Mortensen). Instead of being furious at her lover, he offers him a lot of money to kill his wife and the man accepts. They work out a plan for the perfect murder, but than things go wrong...This movie has quite some suspense to offer and has been well assembled. All actors did a good job and were convincing enough. I'm not saying this movie is a masterpiece or that it is the best thriller I've seen in years, but it certainly is worth a watch. I give it a 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Douglas always brings to every single one of his roles a sort of evil, sinister trait...even when he's trying to play the good guy (I've seen 'Don't Say a Word'). Gwyneth Paltrow is stunning in this, and so is her jealous con of a lover (Viggo Mortensen).A bit of thriller, a dash of suspense, a grand helping of intrigue...the ingredients of a gripping plot. And what-ho! --James Newton Howard did the score. How many times can I heap praise on that composer? The man is a genius, 'nuff said.It was a bit gory at times, and you almost feel sorry for the scheming David at the end **many spoilers beyond here** (or should I say Winston?)....as Emily's husband decides to do the "wet work" himself, as it were. But in the end, both men get what they deserved all along, I guess...even *if* I still think that David really loved Emily and he wasn't entirely using her for her money. But that's just my humble opinion.I can say no more without giving anything away. Put bluntly: see this! (Then go see 'The Fellowship of the Ring', where Mortensen looks much, much more handsome). My score: *4 out of 5*</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great suspense thriller true to its word of deceit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Perfect Murder, I thought, was a very entertaining movie. Full of twists and turns that keep you guessing right up until then end. I really had no idea how it was all going to turn out. And whenever you hear people in a theater yelling at the characters on screen to do, or not to do, something, you know it's got everyone hooked. Michael Douglas plays Steven Taylor, a high stakes moneyman of sorts who is very rich, and very powerful. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his wife Emily, who is also very rich but also very lonely and tired of her marriage. She is having an affair with an artist named David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen) and early on in the movie, the three meet. This is when things start to turn interesting. I don't want to ruin any surprises, but from the commercials you see that Steven finds out about the affair, and he also finds out things about David that leads him to believe that he can get David to kill Emily for a boatload of cash. Steven sets out to try and concoct the perfect murder; one in which he gets rid of his wife, and manages to implicate David, while keeping himself clean. But things go wrong, a man dies, and the cat and mouse game begins. I realize that isn't much of a story to go on, but it's hard saying what happened without ruining all the surprises. The movie really goes into detail showing how meticulous Steven is in his planning. Keep an eye on the envelopes and the cell phones. Think about the key. It really was a very well made suspense thriller. It had me on the edge of my seat. Douglas and Paltrow have always been terrific actors, and they play their parts well. Douglas as the quiet yet powerful and controlling husband, and Paltrow is the world-wise yet home-naive wife. But the standout in my mind was Mortensen. He is one of those guys you see in all sorts of movies, but you don't know who he is. Here he steps out of the shadows and into the big time, and I think carries himself very well. His character is a mixture of lover, con man, and extortionist. He has a very quiet yet powerful demeanor that works very well. Overall the movie was very good, and kept me guessing most of the time. The attention to detail was amazing, and other than a small time in the middle when it seemed to slow down, A Perfect Murder is a great movie to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This drama is like a time-bomb ready to explode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An entertaining thriller with three main characters - a husband (Michael Douglas), wife Gwyneth Paltrow) and a lover (Viggo Mortensen). The wife is cheating on the husband, her husband is plotting to murder her for her fortune and the lover has plans to blackmail the husband. A bad lot all round. I like a small cast. It gives me time to sort out the characters and explore them in depth, become more involved. This is gripping and explosive drama despite the fact that at certain points the story is predictable. There are several gory scenes in the film. There is a stabbing scene with copious blood spreading on the kitchen floor and a surprise knife attack on the train to Montreal. Much of the dialogue revolves around the keys to the apartment door, but of greater importance in the search for evidence is a miniature tape recorder. Gwyneth Paltrow with her sad eyes and frightened expression gives one of her best performances.Michael Douglas as the distrustful scheming husband is always ready with evasive answers. Viggo Mortensen who plays the artist and lover with a criminal past is a handsome crook filled with greed and cunning. The plot is like a time-bomb ready to explode. We don't know where or when. The sequence in the train leads to an exciting climax. You won't fall asleep. This film is guaranteed to keep you awake.</fullReview>

When Douglas finds out that she is doing this, he hires the adulterer (Viggo Mortenson) to kill her. He agrees. When the day comes, he hires someone else to kill her.

		<fullReview>*** Warning, possible spoilers ahead. Only read if you've seen the movie ***The story revolves around a successful businessman (Michael Douglas) who finds out his much younger wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) is having an affair with an artist (Viggo Mortensen). In stead of trying to get even with the artist, he decides to make him an offer of a half a million dollars to kill his wife.Directing the murder (Douglas explains how, where and when Mortensen should kill his wife) and providing himself with an alibi, nothing seems to be wrong. What he didn't count on was his wife fighting off the attacker and killing him.At this point the movie starts getting interesting, because the wife and the policeman, who investigates the attack, start to suspect something fishy is going on and both Douglas and Mortensen have to keep up appearances. Douglas even tries to put the blame on Mortensen, explaining to his wife that he (Mortensen) is only after her money and doesn't love her at all, thus playing deceptive little mind games with her.The movie is pretty good until 15 minutes before the end. Everything gets wrapped up in an unimaginative and predictable way. I found myself looking dumbfounded at the credits when they appeared.All in all a pretty good movie that is totally spoiled in the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>*** Dumb but fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some of the dialogue and situations in this film remake of Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M For Murder are so sluggish the actors often look as if they're swimming through glue. Michael Douglas is the evil banking tycoon husband and Gwyneth Paltrow is the gorgeous young wife who is so perfect because she works as a translator for the UN saving the world every day and has a hairstyle that is never less than totally perfect. Only problem on her part is....she's an adultress! Well, if you were married to Michael Douglas, wouldn't you take one look at Viggo Mortensen and drop dead from ecstasy? Douglas is too much the bad person here, though, as he's just hired Gwyneth's boyfriend Viggo to kill her--it seems he needs the money from her life insurance. At least in the older version, Ray Milland did a good job of playing a seemingly nice man who turns out to be a cold-blooded killer; here, Douglas slithers his way through every scene so precisely, so carefully checking the corners of every room with snakelike eyes that I think I would notice he was a murderer just by walking past him on the sidewalk. Mortensen mumbles too much to be effective (you might want to turn the volume up when his scenes come around) and the production designer's vision of his artists' loft apartment tries so hard to be "lofty" that even the paint-splattered telephone seems like it wants to scream out "Hey, look at me! I'm in character!" Paltrow does a good enough job but this role pales in comparison to the far superior work she did the same year in Shakespeare In Love and Sliding Doors (and I'm sorry honey, but the scene where you broke down in tears at your mother's dinner table had me laughing until I got home). The film is, to say the least, cheesy, but it's really a lot of fun to watch, especially since director Andrew Davis has a good time making it stylish. Features a small but great performance by the beautiful Sarita Choudhury. For more reviews visit http://www.angelfire.com/movies/myoldaddiction</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'A Perfect Murder' - if we're being honest - is a rather predictable affair (no pun intended). This loose adaptation of "Dial M For Murder" headlined by Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow delivers brief doses of suspense, but its never able to overcome formulaic probabilities and the ending is neither satisfying nor shocking. Which leaves the film in a fairly decent state, but hardly a standout. It's saving grace is the acting from the two aforementioned leads and Viggo Mortensen.Douglas turns in another patented role that he can almost do in his sleep now (of late). You know the type. The rich, smug detached man. Shades of 'Wall Street' and 'The Game'. I think he really outdid himself with the latter, but seeing him play another arrogant a-hole is still a pleasure because he does it so well. Meanwhile of the trio of characters in this romp, Paltrow comes the closest to being sympathetic to the viewer. Her interaction with the police detective (David Suchet) who becomes a part of the story for brief periods is an especially nice little touch, but Mortensen is no slouch either. His character's surprise turn(s) and his subdued energy almost steal the show out from the much more well known stars.Money, sex, deceit, betrayal. You know the drill. The plot isn't anything special, but it will satisfy on a basic level. Like eating a meal you've had numerous times before. You know how its going to taste before it even hits your mouth. It's void of any meaningful afterthought or analysis, but between some good acting and those little touches, 'A Perfect Murder' does just enough to satisfy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was really a very big surprise. The screenwriters have really updated the story and added an even greater critique of upper class patriarchy. All three lead performers are at the top of their form and Andrew Davies direction is his best effort. I was really impressed by the creation of this nightmere existence for the Paltrow character, betrayed by both Husband and lover. I also enjoyed the rather nasty view of ruling class life. My one disappointment was a really cliched, classist and racist scene when Paltrow goes (moronically) to investigate a key clue in the case. She goes to a low income, racially diverse neighborhood and the poor and working class inhabitants are used like some kind of dangerous, exotic back drop. This characterization is stupid, dangerous and dishonest. It is a tragic flaw in an entertaining film that could has a great deal to say about power and wealth.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was hard to rate. I initially thought I would give it a 9, but finally decided that it was an 8. Actually, it was an 8.4999, but with rounding....I enjoyed virtually every minute of this film. The fact that it was a remake is of ZERO importance to me. I must assume from the many people who complained about it being a remake and whether it was, or was not, as good as the original Hitchcock film or whether it lived up to some preconceived notion as to what it was supposed to be or whether it deviated too far from the original... I must assume that those people (on average) liked it less. But, since only one out of one hundred (at most) of the people seeing this movie have ever seen/remember Dial M for Murder, then logic dictates that 99% of the population will enjoy it considerably more than the 1%. Of course, the odds are good that the 1% is on imdb.This is a smart, stylish, well acted suspense thriller. It covers the bases significantly better than the average thriller. I had very few questions pertaining to flaws in logic or timing than normal. In fact, after asking my wife why this and why that and getting extremely good answers, I ultimately was left with a desire to have modified only a couple very minor things. And, that's pretty darn good for me!This movie is a credit to all involved. I have to admit that I was caught off guard several times despite knowing how it would end. What makes a mystery really good is when the audience is asking - literally minutes before the end - how are they going to do it? We know what must be done, but we just can't seem to see the avenue to doing it.</fullReview>

It effectively brought Dial M into the nineties. The plot was actually plausible. Another surprise for me. After hearing the difference between Perfect and Dial M I thought it outrageous, but it works. Douglas and Paltrow's chemistry make the couple seem truly what the screen portrays. This movie was indeed a pleasure for me to see. Like Hitchcock's films, I'll watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, okay, so you hear magazines complain about this remake of the old Hitchcock movie (Dial M For Murder) and ditch it without a second thought. Get over it. This movie is almost as good, with some very talented actors, and plenty of twists. For those who haven't seen the original, you'll like this one even more.The story goes something like this: You have an apparently doting husband who is going through some financial struggles, and his wife, an apparently faithful lady, who, unlike her hubby, is doing quite well. When the husband discovers that his wife is having an affair, he hires her lover to kill her. And the fun begins. Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow and Viggo Mortensen are sublime (and convincing) as the lead characters, and for those who complain about A Perfect Murder being a remake, or for those who complain about the older man/younger woman relationship, (something for which other movies such as Entrapment are guilty of too) put those two facts aside and remember that this is just a movie, cleverly made, with more surprises than an episode of Melrose Place (although I can't say that show appeals to me).Give A Perfect Murder the credit it deserves. It's a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not nearly perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Perfect Murder" creates a suspenseful situation early on. Then the movie spends the rest of the time building up to the inevitable...and then gives us the inevitable. After watching the final scene, I wondered if the script was written on autopilot, after lots of cigarettes and coffee, at about 3 in the morning.The movie is a remake, or an inspiration anyway, of "Dial M For Murder". That was only an okay movie, really, and this one doesn't do a whole lot to build off of it. The one thing that it really has going for it are the performances, which are convincing, especially Paltrow and Douglas, who come across as a couple who got tired of each other long ago and are now just going through the motions of a marriage, while Douglas's character harbors deep and secret resentments about the fact that his wife is cheating on him.I enjoyed the setup, as we learn that Paltrow's character, Emily, has been having an affair with a destitute artist, played intensely by Viggo Mortensen. She believes her husband, a wealthy investor, doesn't know. What she doesn't know is that her husband, Steven, is about to get wiped out on the market because of some unwise overseas investments, and knows as well that she has been unfaithful to him. As someone points out, cheating on your spouse is the second-most common reason to kill, and money is the first. Steven has both motives.In a startling twist, he arrives at the artist's home one night and tells him that he knows everything about the affair and the artist's past, which involves jail time and swindling widows out of lots of money down in Boca Raton. Steven offers him an out: kill his wife, for a payment of $500,000. The artist, David, is trapped; on the one hand, he faces prison, on the other, killing his lover. He opts for the latter.David's character is ambiguous, to say the least. At times he appears to truly care for Emily. At others, he seems to care nothing for her. His decision-making is all over the map, and wildly implausible. Steven, on the other hand, is cool even under incredible pressure. He is certain of what to do and how to do it at all times. There are moments in the film where he is confronted with his actions and is able, even in seemingly impossible circumstances, to talk his way out of it. I enjoyed watching his character, even if it was recycled from his performance in "Wall Street".As I said earlier, I enjoyed the buildup. It plays pretty well and is smoothly handled. The movie is a well-oiled machine right up to the end, which is both abrupt and utterly predictable. Without revealing what happens, I will say that I was surprised that the movie did not try for a bolder resolution, especially from Davis, an accomplished director. This was a standard Hollywood ending that is far below a man of his directorial skills.As an afterthought, I might as well mention that the DVD "Criterion Collection" release of this film contains as an extra an alternative ending to the movie, which is supplied both with an without commentary by Davis. Watching it, I was unimpressed; it doesn't deviate enough from the final choice to really make a difference. Yes, there is a shift in the moral balance as far as one character is concerned, but the end result is the same, making it as weak as the original.</fullReview>

Overall this movie was an enjoyable way to pass the time, but not a movie that provokes discussion or debate.

		<shortDescription>Not A Perfect Movie But Still A Pretty Decent One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dial M For Murder is a classic Hitchcock thriller which manages to be suspensful and exciting and it was set almost entirely in one room - an achievement only the master of suspense could achieve.Dial M For Muder has since been re made and well titled, A Perfect Murder. It uses basically the same storyline but mixes it up a little and adds classic 90's formula like sex and violence to the works.It manages to play like Dial M For Murder faithfully but still add many good original moments and brings a cast of Michael Douglas playing the role orginally played by Ray Milland brillantly and Gwyneth Platrow standing in for Grace Kelly.A Perfect Muder's style in a funny way reminds me of the movie The Fan. It's pumped up,stylish and glossy but The Fan despite being stylish was extremely over the top and formulaic and A Perfect Muder though slightly formulaic in some parts is not over the top. It is a great exercise in suspense and an actor in a role that was made for him.Like Douglas playing once again a role of cold hearted business man,but this time he has an unfaithful wife and he hires her lover to kill her!.And as the movie progresses there are several plot twists - some predictable some not and the ending is almost exactly the same as the old one only this time when one of the characerts does find out something it's resolved in a showdown clutching for knifes,bloody 90's style which is too often the resolution for movies nowadays.A Perfect Murder I feel will be a lot more exciting for people who have not seen Dial M For Murder. As for viewers of the orginal you will know the end twist which will make it a tad annoying whereas people who haven't seen the orginal will be pleasantly suprised.Gwyneth Platrow's character in this film is seen a lot but little is known of her and most of the time when we see her she is either in her underwear,in the bath or generally showing some skin. I'm not complaining but when I think of Paltrow I don't see her in roles like this. She is much better used to acting than showing off her body.A Perfect Murder is not a perfect movie but it is one of the better films of 98 so far. It is brimming with style,clever plot twits,suspense and has Douglas in a great performance and it shows us what a thriller should be like This is much better than more recent thrillers which all seem too predictable and similar.3.5/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's refreshing to see a movie that has very little sentimental value, but where the villains get exactly what they deserve. Gwyneth Paltrow is outstanding as the heroine who has an affair with an ill-advised lover. Michael Douglas, trying to avoid being typecast as the rich business tycoon he has played a lot of recently, is now a rich business tycoon who tries to kill his wife. The plot, though not entirely believable, at least made some sense, no small triumph in today's mystery/thriller genre. I understand that this film is a re-make of a Hitchcock movie, but unlike many, this one was a worthwhile effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great thriller!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite Michael Douglas film!! He is my favorite actor, and I think this is his best movie ever. A Perfect Murder is about a rich business man named Steven Taylor (Douglas), who finds out that his wife (Gwyneth Paltrow) is cheating on him, so Steven decides to hire his wife's other lover (Viggo Mortensen), an ex-con, to kill her. If you are ready for a great suspense movie, then I would suggest you see this movie. It is great, and it has a lot of twists and turns in it. Another good thing about is that you never see Michael Douglas as a bad guy, this is him as a really bad guy. Michael Douglas has been in many his like Basic Instinct, Fatal Attraction, Black Rain, Disclosure and The Game. But I think this is his best!!! It is also directed by another known person, Andrew Davis. Who directed the smash hit The Fugitive. So get ready to watch A Perfect Movie!!! Also if you really like this movie I would highly recommend Basic Instinct!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though I liked DIAL M FOR MURDER, this is not one of Hitchcock's classics, so the idea of a remake doesn't turn me off. And for the first 2/3, things are fine, especially since director Davis and writer Kelly add a twist on the "murder" that's smart and surprising. Douglas has played this part before, but he does it well, and Mortenson is good as well. But then there's a dumb twist thrown in near the end, and both Paltrow and David Suchet as the detective (who, as played by John Williams, was the best part of the original) are left twisting in the wind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this thriller, though since it has been years since I saw Dial M, I can't adequately compare the two. The thing I really couldn't get, though, is why anybody wouldn't see through Michael Douglas characters. They are always so tense, and intense, spitting out words and looking like Gordon Gekko. If Emily Bradford was so rich and pretty, why did she need him? Especially why would she marry him? In every scary movie the characters make that critical move where they enter into hell, like stepping into Dracula's castle or going out on the boat to get that big shark. She made hers when she married him. Oh well, it's Hollywood.</fullReview>

Douglas looks good for a middle age man, and I like the idea of his being married to a gorgeous young highly intelligent woman. Paltrow is young, very beautiful in a sexy sleek Audrey Hepburn way. The plot is kind of obvious, but the script and dialogue are good, and the movie pace is fine. Douglas and Harrison Ford are the two best male actors today. Maybe it is a little uncommon for a young, beautiful very wealthy woman to be married to an older man, but that doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suspenseful Fluff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen "A Perfect Murder" twice - once in a theater, once on video. It was a sleek, suspenseful entertainmnet.Does it get points off for being a remake of Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder"? Not really.In the sense that there's too much talent in the world to warrant droves of remakes, I suppose that can be held against the film. Still, 'The Master of Suspense' did not have a perfect track record. "Dial M..." was one of his weaker efforts. Based on a hit Broadway play, the film was directed by Hitch for two reasons. He owed Warner Brothers a movie under his contract, which, as I recall, had him doing a project he loved [perhaps "Rear Window"] in exchange for "Dial M...". He also was intrigued with the new 3-D process, which was to be used in the Grace Kelly/Ray Milland potboiler."A Perfect Muder" has many differences from the original. It has had a definite update. It covers very familiar gound plot-wise, but it does so in that sleek, stylish Hollwood mode. In substance, it's a Subaru. In style, it's a Lexus.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>105 great minutes out of 108!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Because there are so many things to like about this updated version of "Dial M for Murder", I find it bewildering to have run across as many negative reviews as I have. Of course, every movie has its audience. Apparently, this particular one doesn't appeal to the "CON-AIR" crowd...a clientele whose members prefer to feed on computer-generated visual effects; or the "FACE/OFF" freaks...used to hearing 3,000 rounds of ammunition per minute whizzing from high-powered surround speakers.Instead, this movie tantalizes the viewer with 108 minutes of cat 'n mouse intrigue...all of it played magnificently on gorgeous movie sets and locations. The entire affair is pulled off with total believability...thanks, in part, to the considerable acting skills of Michael Douglas and newcomer Viggo Mortensen. There is not an actor alive who plays class or power as well as Douglas. He does it so well, in fact, I'm not even sure if it's acting. As for Mortensen, he submerges himself into his role as Part-time lover-artist/Part-time scam artist with delicate aplomb. The psychopathic subtleties are played to perfection.For those who thought Gwyneth Paltrow too young to be believable as Douglas' trophy wife - or too wooden in her portrayal - it should be noted that couples of their ilk appear in divorce court every day because of such incompatibilities. Often, the only thing these polar opposites have in common is a mutual desire for the good life. I rather enjoyed the fact that when the movie begins their marriage is already in trouble -- partly because of the age gap and partly because of their differing dynamics. In other words, Paltrow's youth and "nothing-in-common" approach was needed from the get-go to help establish a reason for her infidelity.Personally, I thought the movie attained a nice overall balance by blending actors of diverse personality. Indeed, it would have been quite fatiguing had each of the characters played their roles with the same intesity as Michael Douglas or the same casualness as Gwyneth Palthrow.My only disappointment is that the last few minutes of the movie weren't as satisfying as the first one hundred five. I'm not sure why, either, since the screenplay did manage to cough up one final (and very justifiable) twist of irony. Was it because I felt Douglas and Palthrow deserved to walk into the sunset together after all they had been through? Or was it because, if someone had to die at the end, it should have been the OTHER character?Still, "A Perfect Murder" is way too cool a flick and the acting way too fine to be written off as a disappointment. In fact, any moviegoer who doesn't find this picture highly engaging has probably watched one too many episodes of "Beavis and Butthead". Trust me...it deserves an "8" rather than its current IMDb average of "6.6". Bottom line: GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

Steven confronts David and makes a startling proposition; he offers him $500,000 in cash to murder Emily. In order to persuade him, Steven reveals his knowledge of David's past. He knows that David is living under a false identity; his real name is Winston Lagrange and he is an ex-convict who has already served two jail sentences for fraud. Moreover, Steven also has evidence of a third crime committed by David, enough to send him back to jail for another fifteen years, and threatens to go to the police with this evidence if David does not go along with his scheme.Steven has already worked out the details of how David will commit the murder. The basic idea is that David will use Emily's key to enter the apartment the following evening while Steven is playing cards at his club. Emily will be taking a bath, so Steven will telephone her at 10 pm to lure her out of the bath, whereupon David will kill her and make it look like a robbery. The scheme appears to be going as planned; Steven makes the call, and when Emily gets out of the bath to answer it she is attacked in the kitchen by a masked assailant. During their struggle, however, she manages to kill the attacker by stabbing him in the neck with a meat thermometer.Anyone familiar with the works of Alfred Hitchcock will by this stage have recognised "A Perfect Murder" as a remake of his "Dial M for Murder", with the names of the characters changed and the setting moved from London to New York. In that film the main male character, Tony Wendice, had a beautiful but unfaithful younger wife Margot, and arranged a scheme to kill her similar to the one hatched by Steven. In that film too Margot survived the murder attempt when she managed to stab her assailant to death. In both films the husband's motive for wanting his wife dead is not sexual jealousy but financial greed; Emily is an heiress from a wealthy family, and Steven wants to inherit her personal fortune on her death. (He himself has made some unwise, and illegal, speculative investments which mean that he is likely to lose much of his own fortune in the near future). The main difference between the two films up to this point is that in "Dial M" Tony's accomplice is not Margot's lover Mark but a disreputable acquaintance named Swann whom he blackmails into helping him. From this point onward, however, the plots of the two films start to diverge; immediately after Emily has killed her attacker there is a surprise twist not found in "Dial M".Hitchcock is today regarded as a virtual god of the cinema; his "Vertigo" has recently been voted the Greatest Film of All Time. Remaking his films is a difficult task, given that much of the success of the originals is often down to his own, inimitable style as a director; Gus van Sant's lifeless version of "Psycho", more a carbon copy than a remake, is one of the worst films of recent years. Yet although I admire a lot of the work of my (unrelated) namesake, "Dial M for Murder" has always struck me as one of his minor films. The acting is undistinguished, there is no sympathetic character with whom the audience can identify and it is too static and talky, with little physical action apart from the killing of Swann. Its greatest weakness, however, is that it lacks that essential Hitchcock ingredient, tension.Andrew Davis's film is in my view one of those rare remakes which is better than its original. Many of the flaws of Hitchcock's film are remedied; the acting, for example, is better. Michael Douglas's Steven, cold, selfish and manipulative, is a much more effective villain than Ray Milland's bland Tony. (This was the second film, after "Wall Street", in which Douglas played a villainous financier). Grace Kelly's Margot was weak, passive and not a particularly attractive personality; Gwyneth Paltrow's Emily is a much stronger and more active heroine with whom the audience can identify. She may be an adulteress, but any woman caught between two men as nasty as Steven and David deserves our sympathy. The weak link in the acting was Viggo Mortensen's rather wooden David who did not always speak his lines as clearly as he might have done.Virtually the whole of "Dial M for Murder" takes place in one location, the living-room of a London flat, betraying its origins in a stage-play. Although Davis acknowledges Frederick Knott's play as his source, he opens up the action, making it less claustrophobic, and introduces a greater number of action sequences, making the film less static and talky. Above all, he is able to introduce some genuine tension into the second half of the film as Steven, David, Emily and the police play a series of complicated cat-and-mouse games with one another."A Perfect Murder" is far from being a perfect film. Like many modern thrillers it can often seem formulaic and derivative, and it has a number of plot holes; Steven's plan to kill Emily, for example, struck me as being even more doomed to failure than Tony's in "Dial M". Davis' film, however, does have certain points of interest which its original lacks. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Perfect Murder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From director Andrew Davis (Under Siege, The Fugitive, Collateral Damage, Holes), I knew the leading actor and actress starring and I knew this film was rated low, then I wanted to see it when I found it is a rough remake of Sir Alfred Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder. Basically Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is rich and has everything he could ever want, but he still craves more, including more attention from his beautiful wife Emily Bradford Taylor (Gwyneth Paltrow), who is not faithful. She has been sleeping with artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), and of course her husband finds out, but than confront her about it, he goes to him instead, but not to punch his lights out or anything. Steven instead makes David a proposition, he wants him to kill Emily in order to inherit the millions in her trust, and he will split some of it with him I think. We see her all alone and ready to be the victim for the perfect murder, and she is mugged by a man in a balaclava, but she manages to kill him by stabbing him in the neck before he can finish strangling her. Knowing that she should be dead by the time he gets home, Steven goes to see if the murder has been done, and when he sees her still alive he can only play along as the innocent man who found her, and the man dead on the floor isn't David. Later after thinking about leaving Steven, but getting nowhere with David, Emily finds out her husband is in financial trouble, and I guess tries to help. Of course slowly pieces of the earlier puzzle come together and she realises that Steven was part of the murder almost committed, because he gave the killer the key to the apartment. After David is killed by Steven, he tries to kill Emily himself, but she manages to get the gun to shoot and kill him, and the audio tape of with David and Steven making their plan is played. Also starring David Suchet as Detective Mohamed Karaman, Sarita Choudhury as Raquel Martinez, Michael P. Moran as Detective Bobby Fain and Novella Nelson as Ambassador Alice Wills. Douglas is almost as stern as he has been before, Paltrow makes a reasonable victim, and Mortensen isn't as interesting as The Lord of the Rings Trilogy made him, the attempted murder bits are alright, but for the most part, well almost all the way through, I was bored, a dull mystery thriller. Adequate!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original film - "Dial M for Murder" - is much better. The remake isn't... bad, mind you, but it's not as good as it could be. The acting is done well, but could've been better if the script was better. David Shaw (portrayed by the fabulous Viggo Mortensen) is a slightly confusing character, in the sense that one doesn't know if he's out to blackmail wealthy industrialist Steven Taylor (portrayed by Michael Douglas) or if he's out to murder Taylor's wife, Emily Bradford (Gwyneth Paltrow), for money. And in the end, he does neither.I find it incredibly ironic that the name of the film is 'A Perfect Murder' when the only person that was meant to die is the only one that stays alive.Paltrow plays the innocent (or not so innocent) wife of a (supposed) millionaire. Her acting is wonderful, but she's done better. Mortensen does wonderfully as the jealous lover (if you can call him that) and Douglas' portrayal of a heartless blackmailer is chilling, but overall the picture definitely could be improved. I'd recommend the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An almost-perfect murder film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ignore the few minor dangling threads in the script and direction, and you'll enjoy this classic yarn of marital disharmony and intrigue.The biggest flaw is in the casting of slackjawed Gwyneth Paltrow, who glides mannequinlike through nearly all the proceedings with such a deadpan expression that the sympathy we need to make her character work just doesn't click. Worse, her early-on relationship with her charismatic, flawed artist friend seems to fly in the face of the devotion we see from Steven, her husband. That she would consider sacrificing her position for the penniless David is possible, sure, but hardly believable. Considering her husband's seeming early attentions and what we learn of her secret life, we find ourselves less indignant than we should have a right to at the point when Steven makes his proposal to David.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark, Tiresome Soap Opera</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stylish and dark drama stars Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow as a married couple ensnared in a web of mutual deceit and treachery. Despite the couple's wealthy lifestyle, neither one is happy. The plot, which involves a love triangle, becomes somewhat overwrought, and at times confusing. The film has a glossy, soap opera feel.Characters spend a lot of time just walking: on sidewalks, across streets, in alleyways, between rooms, on balconies, in hallways, up and down stairs. I don't recall a thriller where the characters did so much walking around. Whatever the director's intent, the effect is to dilute suspense and pad the film's length.All that walking seems to have tired out the actors who seem to be sleepwalking through their roles. And with not an ounce of humor, the film almost put me to sleep. I did like the spooky music.</fullReview>

How in the name of Joey Heatherton did Suchet remark at his first meeting with Douglas at the crime scene about Douglas'foot print near the body? Why did he assume it was Michael's? When Michael took the key from the bad guy's pocket couldn't he tell it was not his house key? He should have known it was the wrong key. I got 6 keys to my apartment. All the same.

		<shortDescription>The kitchen telephone??!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Undoubtedly in the previous 110 comments posted here the matter of the telephone has been mentioned. Why in the world would the writers expect us to believe that the wife would get out of her comfortable, relaxing bath and trek all the way into the kitchen to answer the telephone? In a home like that there would be scads of phones everywhere - especially in the bathrooms and especially as we've already seen the main characters grabbing their cordless/cell phones right and left. I've only seen the edited tv version. So maybe something explanatory was removed.Otherwise this is a very decent suspense film. Admittedly a different level and caliber of acting and directing than the original. But the chemistry between the three principles seemed appropriate for this version. Douglas with his look, voice and mannerisms is always fun to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Regular Sheepshank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS. It's hard to imagine why they keep remaking classics, aside from the desire to make more money. Frederick Knott's mystery can be played a number of different ways. A TV production some years ago used Anthony Quayle, a splendid actor, as Chief Inspector Hubbard. It followed the script precisely and was dull. This version is updated, more explicit, and more complicated, a sheepshank compared to the original square Knott, and not only isn't an improvement over the play but is well below the standard set by Hitchcock's rendition in 1954. Hitchcock only made the film because he'd had several flops in a row and needed something safe, something that had already proved its popularity, in order to "recharge the batteries" as he put it. He may have chosen it out of desperation but it is suffused with his idiosyncratic brand of irony, humor, and technique. Who could take Ray Milland as the roguish would-be killer Tony Wendice seriously? He belongs up there in the pantheon of Hitchcock's villains along with James Mason in "North by Northwest."Here we have the play spread out over several locations, more violence and blood, and Gywneth Paltrow taking a bath -- none of which really helps much. How can they botch up such a tightly bound plot? By loosening it, introducing irrelevancies, losing the focus on the misplaced key, throwing in simulated sex, and reducing suspense while increasing the movement of the actors.As the head villain, Michael Douglas plays it dead seriously. He broods a lot. His occasional muted laughter is barren, his smiles as phony as they come. He may be rich as hell but he never seems to be having a good time. Of course it doesn't help when your wife is being boffed by some other guy, even if you don't care much for her. Vigo Mortenson, as the boffer, is the auxiliary heavy, and I suppose looks kind of sexy in a greasy, long-haired, unkempt sort of way, the kind of Byronic figure who cares for nothing except his art and the satisfaction of his sensual appetites, which may appeal to women who enjoy being invited to tame this brutishness, the kind of women who enjoy riding slightly spirited stallions. That's the way the part is written anyway. But Mortenson doesn't deliver on the "fine madness" business. His strong face is almost without expression and his voice close to toneless. He comes across as the con man he really is, underneath that painter's smock. Gwyneth Paltrow is the boffee. Her face is beautiful, architecturally structured. It seems all odd angles and large, queerly slanted blue eyes. Her appeal is a bit goofy, too, rather like her mother's, Blythe Danner's, but very real. Her bony frame under those chic outfits lends her image a gawky elegance. She looks inexperienced, vulnerable, easily exploited, manipulable. If she were a greeting card and you opened her up, she would read, "I'm so sorry."I won't go into the plot details much except to say that the characters of Mark Halliday and Lesgatt/Swan are combined into one. Losing the key is a killer mistake as far as the narrative is concerned and it can't be made up for by giving additional screen time to big-name Hollywood stars. The direction is plodding, I'm afraid. The most gripping scene in Hitchcock's "Dial M for Murder" is when Grace Kelly answers the phone and keeps asking who is on the other end, while the killer, having appeared from nowhere, is standing in the shadow behind her, poised with a startlingly white scarf, waiting for Kelly to replace the phone so he can get it around her neck. The attempted murder is horrifying. It ends with Kelly grabbing a pair of scissors (the presence of which, in that particular place, has been carefully but offhandedly explained earlier)and stabbing the killer. The same scene here is more violent. The director shows us Paltrow being thrown all over the place, sliding on a butcher-block table with her robe flying open so we can get a glimpse of her bare legs (she just got out of the bath), dishes smashing, pots being bonged against each other on the ceiling rack. Paltrow grabs a knife -- and here it comes -- but no. The killer manages to disarm her even while strangling her. (Insert further description of plates falling, pans clanging, women screaming, Alaska being drilled for oil, a Keystone Kop falling off a cliff, a rotating kaleidoscope, a merry-go-round with the horses riding the children, a heroin addict trying to insert a suppository, and so forth.) Finally, having run out of ideas, the writers have Paltrow fumble for a gratuitous -- get this -- meat thermometer and plunge it into the guy's neck so that blood shoots out of his carotid artery like a fireman's hose gone berserk. There's gore all over the place. The body seems to lie in gallons of it. There are bloody footprints along the floor, smeared hand prints on the wall, all the way from the kitchen to the bedroom where an incarnadined Paltrow winds up shivering. Maybe it's unfair to compare this murder scene to the way Hitchcock filmed it, but, really, bad taste is bad taste.Well, let's leave the corpse alone. You want to see an enjoyable version of this play? Try "Dial M for Murder."</fullReview>

Only at times it made me look up and pay extra attention as if it was to announce that something exciting was going to happen. Yet, I was wrong.

This movie had definite promise, as any film with Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow would, but the characters that they play are not likeable, and it's difficult to get into the film and the plot twists that it takes.

But the plan does not go so perfect and now he has to face the consequences... I especially liked the detective Mohamed Karaman character, who really adds suspense flavor to the movie. Of course there is no need to mention how great Michael Douglas and Gwyneth Paltrow are. Every detail is well-thought of except one : If you watch the movie with captioning on, it is claimed that the foreign language dialogue between Emily (wife) and the detective is in Turkish. I am Turkish, but I have no idea what language it is. Neither do I have any idea about the greeting style between them... Anyway, except this little detail, it is a great movie and worth to watch.

Hires him to murder Paltrow for a half million dollars! And he accepts!!A real good start that leaves the mind buzzing. Will he do it? Is it a part of a deeper scam. Is Paltrow in on it?The directing, acting and other cinematic pieces are up to the task with one omission; the story.

		<fullReview>There are enough flaws in this movie, that listening to the commentary on the DVD makes you wonder if the creators really knew what they were doing. All hands are looking off in the distance talking away congratulating themselves on a job well done, normal for the course with most commentaries....but there are a few really good things about the film that it should not be thrown into the garbage can altogether. And as for comparing it to the virtues of Dial M for Murder, well, that's ridiculous. Dial M has at least an hour of good solid cinema, this baby maybe ten, twenty tops. The rest is just standard fare. The best scene comes at the first when Douglas is showing Mortenson how he has him nailed, spritely dialog, highly believable. From there the movie starts going downhill, not fast, but fast enough, until finally we have the usual farrago of unbelievability of most thrillers past and present.Even so it is better than most thrillers of the last ten years....which says a lot for how bad the others have been.Which has always been the real trick of the very best thrillers: believability. Very hard the keep the thing rolling along fast and sweaty and still keep enough surprises and twists to hit you with any kind of reality. And overall this one at least gives it a try. Worth one viewing all the way through, but no return visits.</fullReview>

Truly everyone has a favourite over here and as good as Micheal Douglas was I could not but help feeling for Viggo's character. The only place where this film will deflate quicker than a tyre is on the ending , however apart that big hiccup it is worth a look at especially if you have nothing to do on your day off.PERFECT MURDER 8.1 OUT OF 10</fullReview>

After having seen this old movie, I began to think that the story looks very similar to this New Movie with Kirt Douglas. I don't know if the book could be a kind of copy. At least, I think the writer should be mention the idea in which he has based his story. Rights should be protect against this cases.Yesterday night, I had seen the old movie " DIAL M for Murder".

		<fullReview>This movie, finely directed as it is, is merely a cover, for the great "Dial M For Murder" of 1956 (I think) by the master, Hitchcock... It can't compete with the source's power, and as "Dial M For Murder" one of my favorite movies, I sugest you rent/buy/rob a copy of it. now. I said now. *ahem* now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well the story is might happen in real life. It teach us about money power in human life and for not doing affair if you still have husband or wife. I think in this film Steven Taylor is clever person whom not love his wife, he just used his wife to be someone who he can control, because his wife was rich and live in glamours world which is same in his world. To bad Ms. Paltrow is not good enough for her acted, maybe if not Ms. Paltrow whom play in this film this film can be better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Geez, people, what's all this with Hitchcock?"You don't know me, you're too old, Let it go its over!" (C)Eminem.Forget Hitchcock and his over-acted theatric-style dramas that you call "thrillers". I never saw "Dial M for Murder", I have nothing to compare this movie to, and I am not willing to do so. This film should be judged for what it is, not for what you think it might have been if only Hitchcock was still alive. And judged by this criteria, it is a very good thriller. It's not a masterpiece, mostly due to the plot, but it has very good cast which proves itself with solid performances, fair camera work, good score... The plot might be a bit weak, but it surely is far from bad. This movie is a solid 8, and leave poor Hitchcock alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Featuring a two-fisted Gwyneth Paltrow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This quasi-remake of Hitchcock's Dial M for Murder (1954)--which was filmed in 3D, by the way--is a rather good thriller in its own right, intelligently done throughout except for a few scenes near the end when Director Andrew Davis and screenwriter Patrick Smith Kelly lose their judgment and opt for a silly knock down, drag out fight.Michael Douglas plays a quintessential evil kind of guy, evil, ruthless, greedy, two-faced, crafted to excite our loathing ('How's THIS for wet work?'). He is excellent. Gwyneth Paltrow plays his very rich wife who has incredibly poor taste in men. Seems that Gwyneth has become attracted to roles that get her involved with the wrong kind of guys, witness The Talented Mr. Ripley (1999) and Sliding Doors (1998). But she is also very good, as is Viggo Mortensen who plays the murderous con artist.The plot is tight and filled with nice twists. The sets are opulent and dripping with money, and neither the direction nor the camera work calls undue attention to itself. But what really makes this fly is the material on which it is based, the devilishly clever play by Frederick Knott, who reigned on Broadway many years ago. I'll bet that Paltrow was persuaded in part to take the role because the same part was played in the Hitchcock movie by the legendary Grace Kelly. Also, another Frederick Knott play made into a movie was Wait Until Dark (1967) starring the also legendary Audrey Hepburn. I suspect Paltrow could hardly resist joining such illustrious company, especially when the plot here allows her to take matters into her own hands, as it were, and give to her two guys considerably more than she gets.Bottom line: you will be diverted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Perfect murder is not a bad film , it has a lot of suspense and a great story line but somehow it never really hit the heights it sometimes promises. Michael Douglas is is good as the cheated on husband ( why does he always play this type of part?) who plots to have his wife murdered(Gwyneth Paltrow) by the lover and at the same time pocket money to help his ailing buisness. Its a very watchable film which should and could of had some superb twists but in the end it just dishes up dull ending.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains Spoiler After finding that his wife is cheating on him with artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen), Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) is paying him to kill his beautiful wife, Emily (Gwineth Paltrow). In appearance it looks like a perfect murder, but it`s not, because it fails. After this Steven kills David.That`s not the perfect murder,either. But who has done the perfect murder? Emily(Gwineth). The unfaithfull wife did the perfect murder. After she found out about the evidence, Emily didn`t go straight to the police as she should. Instead she stayed home and confronted his husband. She had all the reasons to live, but she prefered to deal with Steven. She kills him in legitime defense with a gun.That was her plan. The most important part of the movie is the last minute, when the police-man told her "go with God" or something like it. The suspence is very smooth and you have to be quite smart to understand this film.All the cast acts very good. What more can I say?A perfect thriller...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It may not be a perfect murder but it sure as hell is a perfect thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>New modern versions of late Alfred Hitchcock's beloved thriller classics usually turn out to rather bad or totally horrible. If Alfie's film is already perfect there's simply no need to shoot it again. It's stupid, it's senseless, it's a waste of time. "A Perfect murder" is a rare exception and a proof that it's not necessarily always so. As far as I recall I haven't seen Hitchcock's "Dial M for murder" but if the mere remake was as incredible as this one then I can only wonder what the original as directed by the master of suspense would be like. I'm certain "A Perfect murder" is Andrew Davis' greatest movie. I didn't love "The Fugitive" that much. Geoff Murphy's "Under siege 2: Dark territory" was actually better than Davis' original. I have no recollection of his another project with Steven Seagal "Above the law" being much better. I thought "Chain reaction" was a slightly disappointing film too.But "A Perfect murder" is something special, it's definitely in the league of its own when it comes to good thrillers. When I watched it for the first time I was thinking this one is a wonderful experience to watch ONCE. But I was quite surprised to find myself on the edge of my seat even when I watch it for the second time and I already knew the story. We don't get thrillers of this calibre too often. Cast is terrific. David Suchet is in the great supporting role as suspicious detective Karaman. Paltrow and Mortensen are both having most sensational performances and Michael Douglas is more than just brilliant. This is the kind of a role Douglas is best at. He's so calm and cold-blooded it's really creepy. I command you to rent and watch "A Perfect murder" instantly if you think you could enjoy a film that gives a new meaning to the world suspenseful. This certainly does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oftem Hard-Edged, but Superior Spouse-Murdering Spectacle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The people who remade the crafty Alfred Hitchcock suspense thriller "Dial M for Murder" (1954) as "A Perfect Murder," with Michael Douglas, Gwyneth Paltrow, and Viggo Mortensen, clearly knew their business. As cinematic remakes rate, "A Perfect Murder" qualifies as a commendably entertaining, often hard-edged, but superior spouse-murdering spectacle which should baffle and captivate any armchair sleuth right up to its explosive, slam-bang finale. Not only have former Steven Seagal action director Andrew Davis and freshman scenarist Patrick Smith Kelly, cleverly updated this vintage but tawdry tale of deceit, but they have also condensed several plot elements so that the story is both more palatable as well as less predictable. Industry insiders claim that test audiences hated the initial ending, so Douglas and Paltrow came back to reshoot a new ending. Consequently, "A Perfect Murder" is never a slavish scene-by-scene remake of "Dial M for Murder," but a deferential, no-nonsense, white knuckled yarn, with gritty touches of 1990s amorality.In "A Perfect Murder," ruthless but financially strapped tycoon Steven Taylor (Michael Douglas) discovers that his elegant but unfaithful wife Emily (Gwyneth Paltrow) is cheating on him with sleazy artist David Shaw (Viggo Mortensen). Emily justifies her extramarital affair because Steven suffocates her with his domineering ways. According to Emily, Steven also fails to fulfill her emotional needs. On the contrary, David quenches Emily's passion and makes her happy. Steven confronts David early in the movie at a diner party that Emily had planned to attend alone. Changing his mind at the last possible minute, Steven accompanies Emily to the festivity where he catches his wife off-guard as she is chatting with Shaw. David and Steven speak briefly, and Shaw states he received his art degree from Berkeley.Later, Taylor exposes Shaw for the fraud, and then blackmails him. David turns out to be an ex-con with two strikes against him. Moreover, Taylor threatens to alert the police about Shaw for an unsolved crime hanging over the ex-con's head. Not only has David lied to Steven about his shady past, but also he has lied to poor Emily. Anyway, Steven offers David a $100-thousand dollars up front to kill Emily, and he promises an additional $400-thousand on completion of the homicide. Incredibly, David agrees. Shaw prefers Taylor's loot to Emily's love. Steven details a simple plan. He has stashed a key outside their apartment which David can use to gain access to their apartment without arousing suspicion. While Steven is at his club for the evening playing cards, he intends to call Emily. When Emily answers on the kitchen phone, David can slip up behind and strangle her. After he murders Emily, David is supposed to tamper with the door locks to make it appear as if a burglary had occurred.Veteran director Andrew Davis ("The Fugitive" and "Code of Silence") and scenarist Patrick Smith Kelly have revamped the stodgy 1950s' "Dial M for Murder" scenario and eliminated several problems that hampered the Hitchcock film. Obviously, Hitchcock could not depict the sexual and criminal elements in the story with the same artistic latitude available to contemporary filmmakers. Rated "R" for 'restricted,' "A Perfect Murder" contains scenes of implied nudity, simulated sex, murder, and profanity, with 9 "f--k" words, 2 "sh-t" words, and 5 "hells" sprinkled in for local color. People are either stabbing or shooting at each other in "A Perfect Murder," and the three principle characters stalk each other like rabid gunmen in a spaghetti western. Davis keeps the sex, violence, and profanity at comparably moderate, non-gratuitous levels. Nevertheless, "A Perfect Murder" spills more blood and portrays its violence with great authenticity than "Dial M for Murder," but nothing approaching the visceral sadism of earlier Michael Douglas outings such as "Basic Instinct" and "Fatal Attraction." Dutifully, Davis and Kelly have left some things intact. For instance, the key still plays a pivotal part in convicting the killer.Veteran action helmer Andrew Davis keeps the story moving swiftly along so that the complicated plot never decelerates the action. Davis doesn't let the pacing lollygag. He stages the action for maximum impact. The fight scenes are brutal but brief. Davis and cinematographer Dariusz Wolski often film the action so that the perspective that audiences have implicates them in the skullduggery. Wolski's dark, brooding Rembrandt lighting enhances the air of danger. The standard shot in "A Perfect Murder" is either a close-up or a medium shot that uncomfortably confines the characters. Davis builds considerable suspense and tension by surprising his audience at intervals with sudden off-screen action that explodes on camera. Characters come barreling off-screen to smash into other unsuspecting characters on screen. These sure fire tactics guarantee that audiences will jump. Along with production designer Philip Rosenberg, Davis creates a murky, hostile environment for his characters to inhabit.Perhaps the worst flaw in "A Perfect Murder" is the unappealing characters. None of these people deserve much sympathy. A dapper Michael Douglas gives off sinister vibes. Steven Taylor resembles Douglas's Oscar winning performance as Gordon Gecko from Oliver Stone's "Wall Street." Douglas projects an effortlessly cocksure attitude that makes him an ideal thug. He wears dark apparel, and he is constantly in the midst of a scheme and a lie. As his wife Emily, Gwyneth Paltrow comes closest to attracting sympathy because she is the most vulnerable character. Nevertheless, Emily's extramarital affair set off this chain reaction, so she isn't entirely whitewashed. Although she wants to do the right thing, Emily is basically as selfish about herself as are both Steven and David. When we first glimpse her, she is wallowing in a spacious but seedy loft apartment with David ('G.I. Jane's" Viggo Mortensen). Mortensen delivers another solid performance as a scumbag. Momentarily, David's vile painter appears to outfox both Steven and Emily. As competitors, David and Steven are almost evenly matched, though Douglas's screen image wins out over the lesser known Mortensen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"A perfect murder", which I've seen yesterday, was a really good film with talented actors (especially Michael Douglas!!!). A fantastic story, showed with a steady camera. Except one (???) mistake: this dopey trainee who couldn't hold the microphone above the camera. It was shown in the film nearly 20 times!!! Doesn't anybody see that? Is this only included in the German version? Last but not least: it was a thrilling movie with a great Michael Douglas playing his part as best as we know him. And Gwyneth Paltrow... I hate FOAM baths! Concerning Viggo Mortensen: he's sympathetic and I hope we could see more of him.</fullReview>
