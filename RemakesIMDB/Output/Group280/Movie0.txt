		<fullReview>I actually discovered that there were two versions of this film, both by the same director, both including Gérard Depardieu, but in the first one, most of the actors are French and it is set on the Isle of Mauritius, and the second, the characters bar Depardieu are mostly American and the film is set in the West Indies or Bahamas but not Mauritius. Why make two films with the same plot ? I just don't know.In my opinion, the better of the two was the first one which is set in Mauritius. Unfortunately, this one is NOT available on DVD and the other IS !! I bought the DVD, thinking I was getting the FIRST but got the SECOND ! Very confusing, especially when the main actor is the same person.I preferred the characters in the first film and found it funnier..but that is of course just personal judgment. I was also pleased to see shots of Mauritius which is a lovely place. In the first film, Depardieu was speaking French, his native language, in the second he was speaking English ......he was obviously less at ease in the humorous situations !! To understand this you need to be able to speak French and, more important, heard Depardieu get irritated in his mother tongue. It's indescribably funny and cannot be translated into another language. That's what I think clinches it for this first of the two films !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film is a true gem lost in the french film industry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a corker! It is one of depardieu's finest, and is well worth watching! I saw this film and was instantly put off by the fact it was subtitled (I only speak french adequately, not well enough to get by with a whole film!) but after 2 minutes I was engrossed! This film is a MUST!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another little French movie worth being seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mon p?re ce héros" is a quote of Victor Hugo, the most famous French poet of all time. And although the movie is very realistic, kind of true-to-life situation, it is full of poetry. It shows one more time that Love is a big awkward thing for everyone. It is a very nice comedy, rather funny and moving. The movie helps to realize the gap existing between a father and a 14-year-old teenager. All the actors (not only Depardieu And Marie Gillain) are sincere while the main subject is "lies" !! I deeply recommend you to see this film and not its remake - a bit too tasteless (actually the dialogs are exactly the same). However, if you want to spend a good time in front of your telly, I believe Mon p?re ce Héros to be the perfect choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually saw this two summers ago in China, I saw a chinese dubbed version, but it was good nonetheless. The first thing to love about this movie is the theme soundtrack that it starts with. I've been trying to get a hold of it ever since. If anyone can help me, please email. Anyway, I loved the movie. Even though a lot of jokes probably got lost in the translation, I still enjoyed the movie very much. It's a very charming film, one of the best foreign films I've ever watched (and I watched a lot of good foreign language films, from Stalingrad to Au revoir les enfants) The dad is truely great in this movie, he puts up with so much, my dad would kick my ass for 1/100 of that. Veronique is great too, not many people have the guts to pull somethign liek that off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How to purchase DVD copy (French version)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We love the movie and so do Australian high school students of French! Could you please let us know how to purchase the original DVD version (in French), preferably Region 4 so that we can watch it here? I am a French teacher and the old video copy that I have of this wonderful, fun and, as the students say, "cool" film is getting more than a little worn out. It is wonderful to see Mauritius which appears to be really beautiful in the film. I could easily enough purchase the American version but no thank you....the French one is so unreal. We love the story of the teenage girl coming to terms with the situation her parents are in as well as her first fling with a boyfriend. We're desperate to purchase this film on DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most beautiful and funniest comedies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been searching for this film I saw on the BBC years and years ago every so often, when people began chatting about films, I would ask everyone, "It stars Gerard Depardieu and he goes somewhere with this girl who's stunning and uses her beauty and, urgh! I can't remember what it's called but it's amazing!!". Everyone looks confused and no-one knows the title. I eventually gave up. Then thanks to the internet, I recently found it! And I bought it. And it is even better than I remembered! The story is simple but perfect. A middle class divorced father and his beautiful daughter (who he dotes on but as with most teenagers doesn't appreciate it much) go to a resort and she quickly pretends he is her lover who is only claiming to be her dad. She gets the attention and sympathy from cute guys nearer her own age and the whole story just develops brilliantly. She is stunning and he has his typical charm and so the whole thing is completely believable from start to finish. Of course, the story has more than that, including some nice little subplots, but I don't want to spoil it. The highlights are Gerard Depardieu's wonderful acting and the fast- paced script. With those excellent sarcastic comments and funny expressions as he deals with his little girl pushing him to the edge of sanity (plus people occasionally trying to hurt him, and once almost kill him) the moments for the highlight real count up fast. Apart from some of the known French classic films this movie is a total gem way above the rest within the French film industry. It's that good, really. I'm not sure this is the very, very best comedy ever but it's definitely in my top 3 for sure. Constant laughs and father-daughter dynamics which are totally accurate make sure of that for me. Even my mother, who is rarely impressed by French films, fell in love with this as much as I did again after all these years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Please do not pass this film by, it is worth all the effort to find it (I found mine on Amazon co.u.k), and similar to other forum users I watched the USA version first. Without going over the film details all of which have been written in this forum and in much better detail than I can muster, all I can say that this should not be compared to the USA version as the French version is far superior in every way.I gave this a 7.5 out of 10, one point missing as the transfer from a VHS take can only be considered very poor, but having said that I would not part with my DVD copy for ten times what I paid for it. Enough said, this is a top French comedy, and Gerard Depardieu out acts everyone again, this is a forgotten French gem :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Touching &amp; funny ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 13 or 14 when I first saw this movie on TV while surfing channels some 14 years ago. I hadn't seen it since then and tracking down a copy proved to be harder than I thought until a week ago when I finally found a site selling it with subtitles.As a 14 year old I had an enormous crush on Marie Gillain who was 15-16 at the time and no wonder: she has turned into a most beautiful woman since (well, she already was back then!). But watching the movie again, it became clear that my fond memories of the movie were caused by more than just a teenagers crush!The "theme song" (Sans mensonges) is great - sung by Marie Gillain - and explains how life without lies would be dull and sad. Even though it was 14 years ago and I only saw the movie once, I immediately recalled it fondly. It's that memorable! This movie has got to be my favorite romantic comedy. It makes you laugh yet also touches you on many occasion. Seeing how a father tries to hold on to his daughter, afraid to lose her, yet at the same time his love for her makes him let go of her in the end. Seeing him help his daughter out of the mess she got herself into. It all adds so much to the character of the movie.And of course the very touchy ending where he stands at the window, seeing her wave back from the boat, thoughts going through his mind. Is he losing her? Will the love for boys get between them?And then the end credits start rolling with the song "Ca va" (sung by Depardieu himself), singing about how he'll be okay - and even if he won't be, he won't blame her.This is what makes a great movie - it touches me far more than any Hollywood movie has managed to do in a loooong time. These actors are not characters - they're real people. They act realistically and not "theatrical". The plausible stories makes it all so much more powerful.A final warning though: don't see the English version first. This is the one to see. They're very similar but the actors and acting (not to mention the location) is much better in this original version.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good-looking, lightweight, overlong situation comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early-1990s French comedy sounds really piquant (a 14-year-old girl pretending that her father, with whom she is vacationing, is her lover), but it's really quite mild. It has pleasant locations and many funny and some clever moments (even referencing Gerard Depardieu's "Cyrano De Bergerac" at one point!), but it stretches its thin premise and predictable story for too long. Depardieu brings considerable charm and surprising physicality to his role, while the beautiful (and yes, sexy) Marie Gillain makes a winning cinema debut. I remember I had a huge crush on her when I watched this movie as a little boy, and re-watching it I realize why! No surprise her career is still going strong, 25 years later. **1/2 out of 4.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My father, the hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A rare thing happened when this French comedy was made: the creator, Gerard Lauzier made a typical American movie. In fact, it appears this was a trial production for the remake Hollywood intended to do a few years later, minus the services of its creator. "Mon pere, ces hero" is a mildly entertaining light comedy for starters, with a Gallic twist.Andre, a divorced man, wants to spend his winter vacation with his teen ager daughter, Veronique in a beautiful place, the island of Mauritius, situated in the Indian Ocean. An island paradise indeed, with a large clientele of French tourists. Veronique feels awkward, at an age that she is still a child, but wants to be seen as much older. A father and a daughter traveling together was not exactly a common occurrence back in the last part of the last century, something that Vero decides to put an end to. She wants to pass as the mistress of her own father, in order to attract the young man she sets her eyes into.The situation Vero finds herself in, is rather unusual for Benjamin, the French young man who likes her. Because of the lie Vero tells him, Benjamin cannot stand sight of the older man that seem to dominate the girl he likes. There will be a confrontation when Vero decides to spend some time with Benjamin away from her father. Fortunately, things are resolved in a civil manner when Andre decides to cooperate with Vero's wishes.A slimmer Gerard Depardieu, one of the busiest men in the French cinema, appears as Andre, the father that wants to have a good time with a daughter he does not get to see as often as he wants. Marie Gillain, whose screen debut this film marked, is fun to watch as the naughty Vero. The promise she showed then has kept her busy after this appearance. Patrick Mille also made his first acting before the cameras shows intelligence and good looks. He showed he was well suited for a success in the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A forgotten gem that was remade in Hollywood within a couple of years, using the same lead actor Gerard Depardieu but substituting Katherine Heigl for Marie Gillain in the co-leading role of Depardieu's daughter. Whilst both are good - if you've only seen the Hollywood version, My Father The Hero, you'll probably like it well enough not knowing what you're missing - but this, the original, has the edge. As it happens both Marie Gillain and Katherine Heigl went on to become accomplished adult actresses which has to say something about the quality of the writing. If you like to smile, laugh out loud occasionally, and weep a little this is right down your rue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the Disney re-make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This French movie was re-made only two years later by Disney (so this is as close as I've ever come to reviewing a Disney movie). The story is about a divorced French father (Gerard Depardieu) who takes his resentful adolescent daughter (Marie Gillain) on a beach vacation. It starts out as kind of a farce when his daughter tells everyone at the resort that her father is actually her much older lover, but it turns much more sentimental and sweet when she meets a boy close to her own age, and her father is forced to realize that she's growing up and he has to let her go. There's no doubt this movie is less saccharine and cloying than the American Disney version, but it is also much more innocent and "family-friendly" than most French "coming-of-age-on-the-beach" movies like Eric Rohmers "Pauline on the Breach" or Catherine Breillat's "Fillete 36". This movie is actually completely appropriate for teenagers--except that American teenagers, of course, cannot be called on to read subtitles, thus the unnecessary Hollywood re-make.Gerard Depardieu (who also starred in the re-make) is quite good in the role of the father. It's quite easy to accept Depardieu as a kind of Gallic Robert Deniro, but his status as a sex symbol is perhaps a little more baffling. Here though at least he keeps his clothes on (thank god) and he doesn't really romance any improbably attractive women. Improbably attractive, however, is a good description of the actress, Marie Gillain, who plays the daughter. She was probably sixteen or seventeen here, but could have easily passed for twenty, and with the revealing swimwear she models, she would probably have a pack of slobbering guys following her everywhere even in France (or perhaps especially in France). It's a little hard therefore to buy her as a shy, awkward fourteen-year-old working up to her first kiss. She gives a game performance though, and whereas her equivalent in the American version, Katherine Heigl, would go onto "Gray's Anatomy" and many horrible Hollywood romantic comedies, each more horrible than the last, Gillain has had a more low-profile, but much more interesting career. This would make a good companion piece either to other fairly "family-friendly" movies with Depardieu like "Cyrano", or to other Gallic teen flicks fit for a high school French class like "La Boum". Not my usual cup of tea, given the Disney connection, but I'd still recommend it.</fullReview>
