		<shortDescription>Funny, intelligent and realistic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a funny, intelligent and, in a sense, realistic comedy about a 14-year-old trying to live her first love while on vacation, and also about the complex, sometimes amusing, sometimes touching, relation between a divorced father and her growing daughter... and about how far a women (not only Nicole, the teen-ager) can go to get the man she loves! I laughed a lot with this lively scenario that never drags.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Thank Heaven" ... for this wild comedy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great comedy and I recommend it to many viewers. The most hilarious scene in my opinion is when Depardieu is playing the piano in a bar; he doesn't know that his daughter is trying to pass him off as her boyfriend, and he's singing "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" ... all the patrons except for one woman walk out in disgust, thinking he's a child molester! That scene is absolutely priceless and will leave you splitting your sides, guaranteed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie for Fathers and Daughers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a great movie this is. I found it full of the delightfully unexpected pain of being a single father of a teenage girl. And it is set in a tropical island 'paradise'as well. Gerard Depardeiux brings his special European flair to this story about a divorced father of a teenage girl. They are on holiday together and she begins to add to the excitement on the island in many unexpected ways. But you will need to see the film for yourself to see all the hilarious situations they find for themselves.There are a few cult classics which all teens should see. This movie should be added to the list. In addition to Dirty Dancing, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure, Rocky Horror Picture Show and Animal House, My Father the Hero should be required film study. Watch it as if you had a teenage daughter and you'll be rolling with laughter. Watch it with your teenage daughter and prepare to be laughed at for months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger. It's about Andre, a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter (katharine heigl} on a vacation, hoping to get a little closer to her. But of course, Nicole isn't that easy to get along with, she just started puberty, i'm guessing. She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time. One day at the beach, Nicole meets handsome Ben, and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad. The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie. I would give My Father The Hero 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think is a great and a VERY funny movie. The story is so funny. The daughter Nicole brings her father Andre, in some very embarrassing situations In an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the daughter pretends that her father is her lover.You just have to see!! Heigl is lovely as Nicole, perhaps too lovely; I'm not sure why she'd need to lie to hook anyone? Gerard Depardieu Acts very great in this comedy film, he is so fun to watch. If you like comedy and romantic film you just have to see this!!! I think you can see this film many time, and you will still have a good laugh.In an effort to impress the boy of her dreams, the girl pretends that her father is her lover.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>M.Depardieu est formidable,naturellement...................................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a problem with the movie snobs who consider Americans to be uncouth semi - literates unable to appreciate the subtlety of the more sophisticated Europeans,les Francais,les Italiens...just about anybody from le continong to whom English is a foreign language.If the humour in "My Father the Hero" is different from that in "Mon Pere ce heros" it is because the French sense of humour is different from that of the American.Not better,not "more clever",just different. If you think it is crass for Hollywood to "borrow" from the French cinema just consider how much the French cinema has borrowed from Hollywood in the first place.Where would Belmondo and Delon have been without Bogart?Truffaut without Hitchcock?Jerry Lewis - not known for his subtle and cerebral style is idolised in France.Go figure........ Monsieur Depardieu is exceptionally good as the hapless divorced father of a precocious 14 year old daughter on holiday in the Bahamas together. Unbeknowst to him,she presents him to the other people at the hotel as her lover so as to make herself more interesting to a boy she has her eye on .Not surprisingly,complications ensue. There are "hommages" to "Green Card" and "Cyrano de Bergerac" amusingly inserted and M.Depardieu goes along with it all very good - naturedly. He does a good Maurice Chevaler impression with "Thank Heaven for little girls" which is in fact funny and rather poignant as his audience,all of whom believe him to be the lover of a 14 year old girl,get up and leave two - by - two as he warbles away,blissfully unaware of what is happening.When he turns round at the end of the song to acknowledge the expected applause the expression on his face is priceless. Without him the movie would be very average indeed.With his huge shambling figure dominating the screen it is a lot of fun.No pecs,no six pack - just a real proper human - type being.Formidable!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I love this movie, it's so underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a funny movie, there's not a lot of those. OK, the plot is a bit disturbing, but very original. A teen trying to get even with dad, because he hasn't been around and almost sending him to jail because she lie to impress an older boy, how could that not be funny? Plus it not the typical movie featuring teens. First remake i've seen, that is better than the original, the only problem with both: Gerard Depardieu. With another actor this would be a perfect 10, because he plays all rolls the same way, sucks. Another problem it's all the women melting over him, that's not remotely believable, he is not attractive!, y had a rubber troll that was better looking than him, come on!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie, to me, is comfort food to my soul. I can't explain it. It's not an Oscar worthy picture, but there's a certain type of sweetness at the core of this movie, that seems to reach out and grab you. It's one of those movies that you break out and watch while you eat a quart of ice cream and cry over a long, tiring day. And somehow the movie manages to reach you. Maybe it's the way each character interacts. Or the wonderful island music that kind of takes you away. It has an innocence that touches you. A charm that many movies have lost. Maybe because it's such a simple story, it's not trying to hard to disarm you, so you get to enjoy the entire thing for exactly what it is. A cute, simplistic, coming of age romance. Three thumbs up ;]</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>being cool,a lesson learned the hard and funny way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a funny comedy about a father and daughter vacationing at some tropical island,where the daughter falls for some boy and trying to pass for what she thinks is "cool",she makes up a preposterous story about her father. I read some of the negative comments,i think those people didn't get the main point of this movie,that exactly because the lie is so preposterous,all the situations are so funny. Besides the funny situations ,the movie has a few nice points to make,that young people often lie to appear "cool" but the only cool thing of course is to be who you are.Then,also it makes a nice point even though its exaggerated of course,what hardships good parents have to go through for their children's happiness.Also,that parents ,sometimes can also learn from their kids about their own life. Depardieu is great in this,and Heigl is also good.i don't agree that there is a huge difference between this version and the French one. In the French one,Depardieu has naturally some more facility with the language but he does a good job in English,also the American version has better production values than the french one and has some extra jokes about what Americans think about the French stereotype,which are funny and don't exist in the French version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MY Father the hero is sweet, funny and cute. Gerard Depardiu is awesome as Andre, a divorced father who takes his fourteen year old daughter Nicole(Kathrine Heigl) to the Caribbean for vacation.While there, his daughter meets a guy named Ben(Dalton James. To impress him, she tells him that Andre is her lover and that her father is in jail for armed robbery and her mother is a prostitute and that she ran off with her pimp. Everyone on the island is soon under the impression that Andre's a child molester. Andre is between two relationships. One with Isabelle(Emma Thompson, who makes a cameo in the end of the film) and Diana(Faith Prince from Spin City). My father the Hero has many funny moments. Like when he's at a talent show and everyone tells him to play something french. So he plays "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" from Gigi. Everyone gets disgusted and leaves. My Father the Hero doesn't deserve a 5.1. I think it deserves a 9.0.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can honestly tell you that this movie is the most awesome movie ever!!! If you are in the mood for a comedy, I totally recommend this movie! So, here's the summary. There is this girl(Nikki) who is fourteen and a half and she goes on a vacation with her father(Andre) whom she hasn't seen for about two years. She expects the vacation to be totally boring, until she meets this boy(Ben), who is much older than she is. So, to try to impress him she says that she isn't on vacation with her father, but her lover. This is a hysterical movie from beginning to end, and I highly suggest it. So rent it and enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First time I watched this movie was on Laser Disc about 5 years ago. I liked it so much I taped it from HBO a couple of years later. The plot is a wee bit cliche, but there are many unexpectedly entertaining scenes, like when Gerard Depardieu (Andre) sang 'Thank Heavens for Little Girls', inoblivious to the fact that the audience thought he was a paedophile, and all those fights between Katherine Heigl (Nicole) and James Dalton (Ben) were just so... amusing, especially with Dalton being impossibly cute and all. Anyway, now I've finally bought the DVD and I'm re-watching it regularly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was recently issued in France on DVD under the title "Mon P?re Ce Héros". When I bought it, I imagined it to be a film where Gérard Depardieu takes his daughter on holiday to Mauritius ( a film which I had seen and enjoyed several years ago ). What was my surprise when they ended up in the Bahamas, and the daughter wasn't the same actress as I had seen originally. On checking, I find that this is a remake of the original film. They should have issued it on DVD under the title "My Father the Heroe" to avoid confusion with the original. Just typical ! That said, the film is very enjoyable and is a perfect copy of the original film which also stars Gérard Depardieu, hence the confusion. The problem is in France they have this terrible habit of translating titles of foreign films into French ( which serves absolutely no purpose at all ) instead of respecting the original.I have a slight preference for the original film, because of some of the characters staying at the hotel, but this film is just as good and funny, though I wonder why they bothered to make this remake - I don't see the point of it as it doesn't add anything over and above the original - it simply equals it.One of the funniest points where GD is singing and playing "Thank Heavens for Little Girls" unaware of the fact that most of the guests listening think he is a paedophile. This is not in the original film and is a plus. Apart from that, the sets and plot are a carbon copy of the film set in Mauritius.So, a good entertaining film - my only bone of contention is with Buena Vista France who should have issued it under its correct ( American ) title to avoid confusion with French ( Lauzier ) version which is unfortunately not at present available on DVD anywhere ! How strange !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this is one of my all time favourite films. its one of those films where i know every line but can still watch it repeatedly without losing interest. i always throw on this film if I'm going on holiday, or if i don't want to go to the gym, just seeing Nikki's gorgeous body will give me the motivation i need. Its an easy to watch film which always keeps me smiling but i know it wont be everyones cup of tea, but if like me you love films that are shot beautifully and have comedy, romance and an interesting plot you will love it. It is filled with great characters and Ben and Nikki are both gorgeous so anyone can stare at something appealing. BOTTOM LINE......YOU HAVE TO GIVE IT A TRY! I watched it on TV one day by fluke and loved it that i had to go out and track it down which took some time and i could watch it everyday. MY FATHER THE HERO I LOVE YOU!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another case of Hollywood Arrogance presuming to eclipse French Style. The original, Mon Pere ce heros, was one of the most charming films of 1991 so naturally the accountants in Hollywood thought they could hire Depardieu and phone the rest in. They did, however, take the precaution of hiring Francis Veber to write an English version albeit one utilising virtually every word of the original. Depardieu brings his Gallic charm and Katherine Heigl shows all the promise that is now paying off. The thing is that when the French make a sort of Lolita-lite they get away with it because the 'dirty French postcard' thinking works in their favour; here the Hollywood idea of lightweight subtlety is to have Depardieu (totally unaware that his daughter has let it be known he is actually her lover), prevailed upon to play and song 'something French', launch into a spirited version of Thank Heaven For Little Girls. See the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Charming film. Laughed pleasantly. I was taken with the piano music that Depardieu played toward the end. Can anyone identify it for me? A Beethoven or Mozart slow piece??? Thanks. Depardieu was very patient in a dilemma that is sadly all too common in our day, the estrangement of the divorced parent from their child. The child grows up without them, the estranged parent dreams of making it all better and creating a better connection. The girl behaved like a teenager in such a situation. The author managed to find true beauty and redeeming emotions in this all too common and sad situation of our modern day. Depardieu is wonderful, the girl beautiful, the boy delightful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weird, or What?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a fundamental difference of opinion between the British and their continental neighbours about how to deal with foreign- language films; we prefer subtitling, whereas they prefer dubbing. Americans, however, seem equally allergic to both dubbed dialogue and subtitles, so have come up with a third way of dealing with movies made in some incomprehensible foreign lingo; they simply remake them as American movies. "My Father the Hero" is an example of this process, one which seemed much in vogue during the nineties. It is a remake of a French film called "Mon Pere ce Heros" and, like that film, stars Gerard Depardieu as the heroic father of the title. (There is, of course, a slight difference in meaning between the French title and the English one; perhaps the translator skipped class on the day his French teacher was explaining the uses of the demonstrative adjective). The film is centred upon teenager Nicole, the daughter of a French father and American mother. Her parents are divorced and since their divorce Nicole, who lives with her mother in New York, has had little contact with her father, Andre, who has returned to France. She cannot speak French and even dislikes her French-sounding Christian name, preferring to be known by the more American "Nicky". And then one day Andre turns up, offering to take her on holiday to the Bahamas. While there, Nicky meets and falls for a handsome seventeen-year-old boy named Ben and (for reasons best known to herself) decides that the best way to impress him is to tell him a series of lies:-Lie 1. That she is eighteen years old. (No Nicky, you're fourteen and don't look any older, so even if Ben does go for older women he's not going to swallow that one). Lie 2. That she already has a boyfriend. (Look Nicky, that's what you tell a boy when you're hoping to put him off. Not when you're trying to encourage him). Lie 3. That her boyfriend is an older man who is not only extremely jealous but also has a prison record. (And if that doesn't frighten Ben into running a mile, I don't know what will). Lie 4. That her father is a convicted armed robber, that her mother is a prostitute and that she herself is a recovering drug addict. (Ooh, Nicky, aren't you just making yourself sound like love's young dream?) To round off this catalogue of mendacity, Nicky tells Ben that Andre is actually her lover. (Weird, or what?) This untruth quickly finds its way around the resort where they are staying, so that before long all the holidaymakers are convinced that Andre is involved in a sexual relationship with an under-age girl whom he is passing off as his daughter, although none of them actually take the seemingly obvious step of reporting him to the police. About the only person unaware of what is going on is Andre himself, who cannot understand why his fellow-guests shun him after he treats them to a rendition of "Thank Heaven for Little Girls" at a talent contest. Eventually, Nicky decides that she has no option but to let Andre in on the secret, and he decides that he will have to play along with her lies in order not to spoil her chances with Ben. (Seriously weird, or what?) It is many years since I saw "Mon Pere ce Heros", so I will not attempt a direct comparison, but I must say that I loathed "My Father the Hero". One problem was with the character of Nicky, whom the scriptwriter obviously saw as a teenage romantic comedy heroine but who comes across as a particularly obnoxious little brat, even leaving aside the fact that she tells lies about her blameless father which in the real world (as opposed to the fantasy world in which the film is obviously set) could have resulted in his being sent to jail. She is the sort of girl who thinks that she can get away with being as sullen, bad-tempered, rude and ungrateful as she likes; both her parents feel the lash of her tongue. I felt sorry for Ben, and kept hoping that he would have the good sense to ditch Nicky and find a nicer girl closer to his own age. Katherine Heigl has since gone on to become a well-known Hollywood name, but I must say she did not show a lot of promise in her teenage years. Three years after this film she went on to make the even more dreadful "Prince Valiant". Someone must have thought that it would be a good idea to get Depardieu to reprise his role from "Mon Pere ce Heros", but that somebody had obviously forgotten that Depardieu, a fine- sometimes electrifying- actor in his native tongue, cannot act for toffee in English, a language he does not speak with any fluency. Here (as in some of his other English-language movies) he falls back on a sort of "amiable slob" persona, which makes it difficult to imagine that Andre would ever be taken seriously when, as part of his attempts to assist Nicky's romance, he tries to invent all sorts of stories about his life as an international adventurer. My main problem with the film, however, is that its central premise is just screwed-up. A teenage girl who could behave in the way Nicky behaves in this film, regardless of what the film-makers might have you believe, would not be a loveably kooky romantic comedy heroine. She would probably be a delinquent in need of treatment for some serious mental health issues. This must be one of the weirdest comedies of the last few decades. And I don't mean that in a good way. 3/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All "Andre" (Gerard Depardieu) wants is to spend some quality time with his 14 year-old daughter "Nicole" (Katherine Heigl). So he takes her to Jamaica for a nice vacation. However, when she gets there she happens to fall in love with a young man named "Ben" (Dalton James) and in order to impress him says that she is actually 18 and that Andre is her lover who rescued her from a life of crime and drugs. One thing leads to another and soon the entire resort is under the impression that Andre is a child molester and treat his friendly gestures with complete disdain. Meanwhile, Nicole discovers that in order to continue the ruse she has to continue stretching the truth even more out-of-balance than ever before. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, in spite of the risqué subject matter, this turned out to be a nice little comedy. I especially liked the scene where Andre is asked to play the piano and he chooses a song that infuriates the crowd. In any case, I enjoyed this movie and I have rated it accordingly. Slightly above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Odd Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A teenage girl (Katherine Heigl) on vacation in the Bahamas with her divorced father (Gerard Depardieu) tries to impress a potential boyfriend by saying that her father is actually her lover.There are a number of strange things about this film. Fans of director Steve Miner might be interested, and Katherine Heigl fans may want to see her first big role. And then there is Depardieu, who was huge forever but might not have been as big in America. I first saw this film, as many people did, when it first came out, but it actually is more enjoyable now (2016) because of where those involved ended up.But really, is it not strange to make a family film about an accused child molester? We probably should not be laughing at a man who is repulsing his friends because they think he is sleeping with a child (who also happens to be his daughter).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Heigl movie, mostly entertaining but lightweight.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is available as a "new" Netflix streaming movie online. I was curious about Heigl, she is now an established TV actress but I had never seen her in an early role. I find that she was better then than she is now. She reminded me of a blond Natalie Portman at the same ages.This is the story. Her dad is Gérard Depardieu as Andre, divorced from her mother. Katherine Heigl is the daughter Nicole, living in New York, and 14 getting ready to turn 15. (She was actually about 15 during filming.) Dad is picking her up to take her to the Bahamas on a 10- day vacation.Dad is unprepared for how grown up his young daughter has become, including a very revealing swimsuit. Then things get very complicated as Nicole begins to tell others that Andre is actually her lover. Pretty risqué for a 14-yr-old character. The biggest complication comes when a boy, Dalton James as Ben, takes and interest in Nicole, and is perplexed that she would have such an older boyfriend. Everything comes clear when she gets stranded on a sailboard, Andre goes to the rescue, almost drowns, and Nicole is calling him dad.But all ends well as she writes a letter of apology to Ben, and the movie ends with them embracing on the beach.Nothing significant or memorable, but it is fun to see Heigl in an early role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but a fun little movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gerard Depardieu stars as Andre, a divorced Dad taking his 14 year old daughter (Katherine Heigl) on holiday. She is mad at him over a previous issue, and acts like a spoilt brat for the entire movie. Almost as soon as they land, she takes a shine to Ben (Dalton James a good looking 20 odd year old playing a teenager) and starts off lying to impress him, it starts with her age, then she reveals Andre is not her father, but her lover.Here is where the movie falls apart a bit, as t fails to take advantage of all the hilarious situations that could come from this situation, and pretty much plays it safe.As for the cast, Depardieu is the star of the show, and he gets the main laughs. Heigl is cute enough and she looks good in a thong bikini, but her acting is not up to scratch, which is more evident when she needs to cry. James reminds me of a young Tom Cruise, and should of had a bigger career.It's not an Oscar worthy picture, but there's a certain type of sweetness at the core of this movie. I liked it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thank you for little girls ? My Father the Hero</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve Miner's film My Father the Hero, a remake of French film Mon p?re, ce héros that came out just three years earlier, is definitely a film that shows its age. It exudes mid-90s aesthetic from its music, clothing, and overacting, but surprisingly still becomes a gem of a film almost two decades later. The only reason I can say that is because of the wonderful performance from Gérard Depardieu. In a role that asks him to play the fool at every turn, even to partaking in a John Candy/Great Outdoors type water-skiing incident, the Frenchman goes for it completely and as a result benefits the entire production. Caught inside a lie that he is unaware of?a lie that his daughter has been spreading, saying she and he are lovers?his reactions to the disgust of the other vacationers in the Bahamas are priceless. Completely oblivious to what he sees as absurdity on their part, Depardieu steals the show and makes what would otherwise be a throwaway film worth a rental. And thankfully so, because its other draw would be seeing a young Katherine Heigl before her, in my opinion, unwarranted explosion of late, post-"Grey's Anatomy". If that were the only reason to see it, I'd have said stay far away.Okay, maybe that was a bit too harsh. In all actuality, this may be my favorite role by Heigl. She plays the spoiled rotten, bratty fourteen, (and a half), year old to perfection. You will hate her character as what starts as cute precociousness morphs into ambivalence to those around her and your want for this selfish girl to get hers in the end. Heigl's Nicole makes a complete buffoon out of her father, the one person who actually cares about her, (from what we see at the beginning concerning the relationship with her mother, I don't think I could say the same for them), and begins to make a mockery of all those around them with lie after lie. I'll admit to hoping that something tragic would befall her, maybe even the death of Depardieu?after she lies that he is dying of heart failure?to finally get her to understand the consequences of her actions, but alas, this is an innocuous family film, so it will all work out in the end somehow.What you don't discover until the conclusion, however, is that the film isn't about Heigl and her evolution, but instead about Depardieu's Andre. The title doesn't refer to how Andre becomes Nicole's hero; it speaks to the fact that the movie is about him being that hero. The homage to his turn as Cyrano de Bergerac, (Steve Martin's Roxanne for you people unaware of the French original), is a nice touch, coaching his daughter on the way of love while also reeducating himself, opening his own eyes to what needs to be done in order to win back his girlfriend in Paris, (a character shrouded in secrecy until the end, revealed as a well-known English actress). My Father the Hero is about Andre growing up to become the father he thought he was. In his mind he had been there for his daughter the past five years, but soon discovers that he was far from being by her side, even skipping her thirteenth birthday. An error in judgment for which she found out about while bringing him soup under the impression he was home sick. What we assume was a selfishness learned from her mother is realized to be a stubbornness and guarded armor against the man who let her down when she needed him the most.Andre is also coached along in the ways of a young girl's quest for her first love by the fantastic Faith Prince as Diana, a divorcée looking for her rich Italian future husband, but willing to settle for a Frenchman if she can. The cheesiness in her role works splendidly, infusing some nice comic relief playing off Depardieu with aplomb. Her inclusion is a welcome break from the headshaking lies and all-around brattiness Heigl brings, adding a good feminine influence to the film. She opens his eyes to Nicole's cry for help, how the girl is lying to win over the boy that she thinks she won't get unless appearing more adult than her barely high school age portrays. Also, Diana's "advances" and genuine friendship towards Andre allows for the acknowledgement that Isabel, in Paris without him, is the one he can't live without.So, in the end, amongst what could be some pretty creepy moments of pedophilia, love is definitely in the air. Laughs are had all around, with confusion adding to the dynamic between pretty much everyone on the island versus Andre, and we get some nice slapstick moments to go along with more verbal subtlety. The music will get you grooving in that nostalgic, am-I-grooving-because-its funny-or-because-I-want-to way, and Depardieu will win you over as he attempts to protect the love of his life and be the father and hero she deserves. Whether, by the end, you decide she does in fact deserve that kind of man in her life?it's a tough question to answer, I know?you can't help but smile at the outcome of all the shenanigans that occurred. If you can laugh about a situation where people think a fifty-year-old is dating a fifteen-year-old?because it is honestly utilized for laughs?and just want a nice check-your-brain-at-the-door evening, My Father the Hero can get the job done.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silly idea, but quite a good movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Andre hasn't seen his teenage daughter Nicole in a couple of years, so when they meet up again he takes her on holiday, so they can spend some time together. Things are going well and when Nicole meets a local guy named Ben at the holiday resort, she's desperate to make a good impression and tries to appear more as a woman than the young girl she is. So, she ends up making up ridiculous stories, in order to do just that. One of these stories that she makes up is that she tells everyone, including Ben that her father Andre is her lover. In order to make his daughter happy, Andre agrees goes along with Nicole in pretending he's her lover, which leaves things going even more ridiculous than they already are.Gérard Depardieu plays the father Andre here and to tell you the truth he doesn't really suit comedy, but he does okay here. The brilliant Alicia Silverstone was meant to have the role as Nicole and she would of been much better than Katherine Heigl, still Heigl is okay here too.My Father The Hero is a strange comedy, (I mean come on, a father pretending to be his daughters boyfriend. ?) but it's quite good and if you like silly fun comedies than your bound to like this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Entire concept gross. A daughter pretending that her father is her boyfriend for any reason is disturbing and she needs therapy. Even after her dad learns of this she is more concerned that he keep her secret (she's okay with everyone in the entire resort thinking he is a child molester while) because she does not want to lose the guy. How self-centered is that? And then he goes along with it because he does not want to ruin her first chance at love. I would have ruined her first chance at love and any chance of leaving her room for the rest of the summer. The daughter is a little brat and I couldn't deal with this movie and finally walked out of the room. Anyone who finds this movie funny needs their head examined. I would say this ranks as being one of the worst movies I have ever seen in my life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My Father the Hero. Fun fact; this was the first film I walked out of. I am now 34 years old, but I still remember vividly the climax of the movie-long comedic buildup. That scene depicts an audience booing a middle-aged man, whom they suspect to be a pedophile, as he plays the piano and sings a spirited rendition of "Thank Heaven For Little Girls." He isn't, in fact, a pedophile- his young teen daughter simply claimed that they were dating in order to impress an older teen love interest. What hijinks! Imagine the hilarity that ensues! Get it? The father is confused by everyone's booing... but it's really because his daughter told everyone that he was a pedophile! L...O...L. Oh, Depardieu- you're too much.The scene with the song is made all the more impactful by Gerard's accent. There's something even more unnerving about said situation when you're hearing, "Sank Hayven for Leetle Galez!" I can't explain why. Some things, like the song of the Nightingale or the Golden Ratio, just are.I have very little opinion regarding a singular line that filmmakers must not cross- as related to cinematic tastefulness, censorship or obscenity. However, even those who don't find the premise of this film as abhorrent as I do will still agree that it may not be the greatest idea to build your PG-rated family comedy around a single-layered incest/pedophilia gag that begs for the drummer to hit the two snares and cymbal. However, the drummer knows better.Really, the funnier movie would be a film about a studio green-lighting this atrocious offering. Kind of like a molestation-themed version of "The Producers." Or not. Anyway, thanks for reading my first review. And hats off to the "My Father the Hero" team. Well done, fellas. -E</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>awkward unfunny comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nicole (Katherine Heigl) is a 15 year old living with her divorced mother in Manhattan. She is forced to go on vacation with her French father Andre (Gérard Depardieu). She insists on calling him Andre. She hates being in an old people's resort in The Bahamas. She falls for local Ben (Dalton James). To make herself look more mature, she tells him that she's 16 and a secret mistress to Andre while pretending to be his daughter. A rumor of their disturbing relationship soon spreads throughout the resort. Nicole keeps adding to her tall tale.Katherine Heigl started to be hot as an underage teen. Sometimes that got played up in her early movies. This one shines a bright spotlight on the issue. Dalton James looks a lot older than his character who is suppose to be 17. The whole underage issue is awkward and keeps any comedy from being funny. Gérard Depardieu may be funny to the French but he is not that funny in English. There is no way his flailing around could overcome the movie's inherent awkwardness. When he starts going with the lie, it turns from bad to annoyingly stupid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this, just the other night, it's okay entertainment and agree the funniest part is when Depardieu is singing "Thank Heaven", he also reminds me of the French version of Richard Gere, both have rather huge noses, (Depardieu looks like he's going down the same path as Marlon Brando)Depardieu needs to lay off the French crusine, this guy is a blimp and this movie is more than 10 years old, i haven't seen him recently but bet he's heavier, anyhow, i think he does a fine job with the script he's given, he alone carries this movie, (Lauren Hutton is given a small part) back when he was gaining momentum in the U.S. as a viable star, though accomplished in France as a major star and (believe it or not)sex symbol, obviously the sex symbol status was from his earlier days, i give it 6 out of ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first it seems the topical romance movie where a girl meets a boy and fall in love, but the point is that this movie has a feeling others don't have.The first time i saw it i couldn't see it complete because i had to leave.But while i was walking along i thought i must see it again but i didn't have any opportunity by then.One year went by until i saw this movie in a not-free channel and i saw it and i recorded it too.I saw it once,twice...until 200 times and not kidding.I did know all the dialogues by hart and i don't know why but i saw it everyday and never got bored.And i have to say that I'm not used to see a movie more than twice.The act is very good.Gerard Depardieu is a talented actor and katherine heigl too.I would like her to be in a good movie because i think she can do it.On balance,it's a movie i can't take out of my mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm very appalled by this American version of 'Mon Pere ce Hero', which is a beautifully made film, wonderfully acted as well. Why do they have to make a re-make? Is English-speaking audience not able to appreciate a lovely subtitled film as such? The remake is AWFUL. Wrong girl, wrong music, and Depardo's sense of humour is completely degraded in this film. A very lousy copycat. It's a total insult to the original one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some things are always wrong...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>and parading around a 14-year-old girl in a thong swimsuit is one of them. To fans of this movie, I'd like to ask: would you allow your daughter to walk around a resort dressed like that? And would your 14-year-old be able to handle the reaction she'd get from men? If yes, I'd like to know why, on both counts. A suit like that is a clear invitation to men; it's hypocritical to suggest that's not. And on another point, what teenage girl would ever claim her father was her lover, without the excuse of severe mental problems? That's almost as disgusting as the swimsuit. Simply put, some things are just not funny or appropriate, and they never will be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unfunny and rather bland film with little going for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen her father for ages, fourteen year old Nicole has become a young woman when her father Andre comes to New York to take her away on a beach holiday. Nicole is embarrassed by her father and is struggling with being a woman and a girl at the same time. Keen not to appear childish in front of hunky Ben, Nicole tells him she is 16 and pretends her "father" is actually her lover. The plan convinces Ben of her age but when the story gets around that the much older Andre is having sex with a 16 year old, it causes problems at the resort.Although it took me quite a long time to get over the idea of a comedy revolving around the early sexual blooming of a 14 year old wearing a thong bathing suit, I eventually did and once I had all that was left was a rather bland comedy that had quite few laughs or moments of interest. The plot is in two basic threads. In one the annoying and totally undesirable Nicole tries to get Ben to fall for her. In the other Andre suffers because of unknowingly being taken for his own daughter's sugar daddy. Neither thread works at all well and the result is a mostly bland concoction that didn't interest me at all. The direction is suitable nondescript and does nothing with it.The cast can't lift the material and mostly are just so-so. Without any charm in the script, Depardieu just seems clunky. He has very little charisma with Heigl although that isn't all her fault. She only has two modes ? one is forcing her looks, the other is being petulant and spoilt. It does nothing to help make the material interesting or charming and she isn't any good. Support is average from James and others as the story is not good enough to give them anything to work with and there is nothing else for them to do.Overall this is a bland comedy that may appeal to teenage girls with the giggles but it did nothing for me. The material lacks charm and the cast just plod their way through it. Even ignoring the uncomfortable idea of the 14 year old girl pretending to be sexually active with a man in his late 40's this still is a strange and unfunny film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disturbing and not terribly interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have really enjoyed several movies by Gérard Depardieu and expected I'd like this movie a lot more than I did. The biggest reason was that I just didn't find the movie very interesting or funny--so, it didn't hold my interest. Also, although he does NOT sleep with his headstrong daughter, the idea that she is lying by telling everyone that he is her much older lover is just plain icky! Yes, I know there is no incest and I know that nobody around them knows he really is her father, but I found that any kid passing her dad off as her sexual paramour is too yucky and prevents the movie from truly being funny. In addition, I really didn't like this little brat very much. Apart from her lies, she seemed very sassy and self-involved. I would have preferred if somehow she'd gotten her "come-uppance" and somehow been punished, as I just didn't like her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame...contrived...formulaic...a perfect date movie, if the girl you're with is an airhead.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About one step above an Olsen's twins film, there's a nary a surprise in store here except for how repulsive the bloated, hunchbacked Depardieu looks walking around the beach without a shirt on. This guy was supposed to be some sort of heartthrob? Quasimodo hubba hubba? Well, whatever.Katherine Heigl's a great actress, whose career over the last several years has displayed a lot of her potential as both a comedic and dramatic actress, but this movie definitely didn't do anything to offer her a break-out role. Her vapid character lacks any trace of personality or self-esteem, spending her entire vacation crushing on a cute boy that she thinks is the greatest guy in then world (basically because he's a cute boy), yet she can't be honest with him for two seconds. Ladies, let me tell you something; if a guy's really into you, he's not going to stomp off in a huff because you tried to pass your dad off as your boyfriend. He may be a little confused about why you'd do something so silly, contrived, and um...incestuous, but in the end it's just going to be something you'll laugh together about.The plot and dialogue hits every clche' right on cue. No originality and no wit...but it's rilly, rilly SWEET and Ben's rilly, rilly cute so viewers who think Titanic is the greatest movie ever made will of course say this movie is great because they won't notice that it doesn't have a brain in its head. One star.</fullReview>
