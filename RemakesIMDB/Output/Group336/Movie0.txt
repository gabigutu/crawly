		<fullReview>Truly one of Universal greatest unsung horror films, The Old Dark House is a unique blend of gothic setting, quirky characterizations, wicked black and dry humour, a great ensemble cast, and the workings of the mind of James Whale. Whale made the film the year after Frankenstein. He was again paired with Karloff. But unlike their first association, Karloff's star is far less brighter in this film as his performance, although good and servicable, is over-shadowed by atmosphere, Whale's direction, witty dialogue, and a cast of scene stealers such as Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Eva Moore, and Ernest Thesiger. Others in the notable cast include lovely Gloria Stuart, Lillian Bond, and Raymond Massey. Thesiger and Moore, as the brother and sister imposed upon by travellers in the stormy night, are fantastic as they interact and play out their eccentricities to perfection. Thesiger has the choice lines in the film as the effeminate Horace Femm, a cowardly man that cowers to his deaf sister. He is a joy to watch and each of his lines oozes with oil. Moore is also very good as she bellows repeatedly, "N beds! No beds! They can have no beds!" The story is based on a novel by J. B. Priestly. The plot is somewhat antiquated now, but Whale's direction puts a lot of life into it. And let's not forget Karloff, however small his part, still turns in a great menacing performance as a lecherous, drunken servant named Morgan ogling Gloria Stuart from the moment he sees her. The Old Dark House is a great film, and it should be more highly touted by Universal!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ernest Thesiger Rocks the House!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you're expecting a horror movie, forget it - that aspect doesn't really kick in until the last couple of reels and was probably pretty old hat even in 1932. What you get is something altogether more unexpected and much more welcome - one of the greatest comedies of manners ever made.Those who don't like their wit dry need not apply, but those who do are in for a real treat. Charles Laughton's blustering but good natured Yorkshireman channels more than a pinch of George Formby, but it's Ernest Thesiger who steals the show even more wholeheartedly than he did in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - never has one man got so much comic mileage with so little visible effort from the words "Have a potato." Forget Dr. Pretorius, this is the absolutely unique Thesiger's finest hour. There are plenty of good lines to go round the rest of the tremendous cast ("Not even Welsh should sound like that," notes Melvyn Douglas when confronted with Karloff's grunting), the characters are really rather likeable for a change, and even the wildly unconvincing casting of an actress to play the family patriarch does not detract. Not a horror classic, not a prototype slasher movie (despite its obvious influence on the genre), but a truly great comedy. Sit back, pour yourself a gin and have a potato...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tod Browning (Freaks, Dracula), Karl Freund (The Mummy, Mad Love), Fritz Lang (Metropolis, M) and James Whale?. these are the guys that created the fabulous horror genre as we know it. And try to pick the most essential movie from Whale's repertoire! Alongside 'Bride of Frankenstein', this has got to be his finest creation and easily one of the most influential films ever made. The Old Dark House is a gripping mix of suspense and macabre black humor. The story is ridiculously simple and shows 5 people stranded near a remote, sinister house during a storm. There, they encounter the vicious and eccentric Femm family. The butler (played by the legendary Boris Karloff) is a dumb, scar-faced drunk; the lady of the house is deaf and aggressive and her brother speaks with an incomprehensible accent. On top of this, there's a bearded lady in the attic (supposed to be a 102-year-old guy) and a deranged pyromaniac brother locked up in yet another room! It sounds a little like the TCM Sawyer family forty years ahead of time. Whale constantly inserts subtle humor into his film, without actually losing a bit of the sublime Gothic atmosphere. This may well be the very FIRST haunted-house movie and he already makes it some sort of parody.The Old Dark House is one of the lesser-known classic Universal horror movies, which is quite a shame. It's excellent every way you look at it. At first, it might seem a little slow (especially compared to Whale's equally brilliant 'Frankenstein' and 'The Invisible Man') but that's quickly made up by the utterly unique characters this film features. Classic, efficient horror like they'll never make it anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Have a potato ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While perfectly enjoyable as a camp comedy of manners (that element comes courtesy of director James Whale) and as an elegant, low-key horror, The Old Dark House can best be appreciated when you know a little about JB Priestley, author of the source play Benighted. (Or was it originally a novel? It definitely exists as a stage play, at any rate.)Priestley was an English playwright, novelist, radio broadcaster and journalist who became very well known in Britain in the 1930s and 1940s for presenting a kindly, commonsensical version of socialism and community spirit to a nation battling through the Great Depression, the Second World War and its aftermath. Several of his plays combine a supernatural or at least mysterious strain with an allegorical message about the importance of unselfishness and people working together to help one another. If you watch The Old Dark House with these points in mind you may see it in a more moving and profound light. Dangerous Corner and An Inspector Calls are similar examples of his work, still popular in Britain with amateur drama groups and touring theatre companies.If you can, see Old Dark House and Whale's later Bride of Frankenstein as a home video double bill and compare Ernest Thesiger's delightfully feline and remarkably similar performances as Horace Femm and Dr Praetorius. "Have a potato" and "Have some gin" may well become part of your private family language for ever after.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best of the Golden Oldies of Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I have loved this movie since I saw it Fifty years ago, and it was a revival, even then. It is certainly, in my book, the best film James Whale ever made, and if you see it on a good print, it stands up very well. The setting of the Old House on a dark rainy night is brilliantly done and the mood is held all the way through. The cast is excellent headed By Boris Karloff as the sometimes out-of-control Morgan, and Charles Laughton is a delight in his very off-beat role. Raymond Massey and Melvyn Douglas both contribute to the fun as does Gloria Stuart, but the creme-de-la-creme comes from Emma Dunn and Ernest Thesiger as the Femms - who can ever forget Mrs. Femm saying "No beds, you can't have beds!", or Mr. Femm offering the guests at meal time "Have a Potato". The remake many years later is an insult to this film, and should not be shown anywhere. Look everywhere you can to try and get a copy of this 1932 masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another gem courtesy of James Whale!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House is the least well known of James Whale's four horror pictures, but don't let that fool you, as this one is just as good as anything else Whale ever made. Despite being over seventy years old, The Old Dark House still holds the power to feel like it could have been released yesterday; much like the rest of Whale's horror movies, which are as fresh today as they were the day they were made. The plot follows three people that get caught in a storm and are forced to take refuge in the only place nearby - an old dark house. There, they encounter the house's strange inhabitants - a nearly deaf woman and a cowardly old man, along with their creepy butler (played by Boris Karloff), a scar faced drunk. More travellers turn up, and the film only gets more fun; introducing us to more strange characters, including a very weird old lady...with a beard, and something else, which is so horrible that the inhabitants are forced to keep it under lock and key?The Old Dark House is one of the first haunted house films ever made, and it works, primarily, for two reasons; the house itself and the cast of characters. Both of these entities are intriguing elements in their own right, and they combine to great effect. The house is, as you might expect, old and dark; and it's a sublime horror setting because of that. It creates a constant sense of malice and through it's dark corridors and many rooms, Whale is able to make the house into a labyrinth where we can believe that anything can happen. This coupled with the fact that the 'normal' people in the house are stranded there, thus creating claustrophobia along with the raging storm outside makes for an atmosphere that is as dark and morbid as anything that cinema has ever given us. The characters inside the house are enigma's themselves; each one is as frightening and inventive as the other, and they have all been imitated several times by later horror films. Even the travellers that are stranded in the house are given unique to each other. Whale also uses a few of these characters to implement his own brand of black humour (which can be felt strongly in his other three films as well). Many horror films don't work character-wise because they're all so similar to each other; but this film certainly doesn't suffer from that.Overall, The Old Dark House is another feather in Whale's already feather filled cap. It's as genius as any of his other horror films and overall it's a crying shame that Whale didn't do more work in that genre, as that is the genre that is so rightfully his. If I haven't made it clear enough already: this film comes with the highest recommendation from me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Laughter and Sin!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tales about sinister, creepy mansions were already clichéd by the time director James Whale directed THE OLD DARK HOUSE--and instead of presenting the piece as a straight-forward thriller he mixed the film's very atmospheric cinematography with a wild strain of parody. The result is a movie with a bizarre camp humor that foreshadows Whale's slightly later and even more bizarrely camp THE BRIDE OF FRANKESTEIN.The plot, very based loosely on a J.B. Priestly novel, is perfunctory, existing only to throw together an ensemble cast of already-famous and soon-to-be-famous stars. Five motorists are trapped in the wilds of Wales during a horrific storm and are forced to seek shelter at, of course, an old dark house... but their unwilling hosts are a neurotic Ernest Thesiger, his religious fanatic sister Eva Moore, and their hulking, deformed, and mute butler Boris Karloff. Before the night is over the storm-weary travelers experience everything from a hellish meal to religious lectures--not to mention assault, attempted rape, mysterious cackling, a bit of arson, and a touch of homosexual hysteria (courtesy of Thesiger, Moore, and a surprise male character who is actually played by a woman) thrown in for good measure.The cast is exceptional; in addition to Karloff, Thesiger, and Moore, we have Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, and Lilian Bond, and they wring the most from the covertly wicked script, with Eva Moore ranting about "laughter and sin," Thesiger inviting Raymond Massey into his room "to see a few things," and one of the most socially awkward meals ever put to film. But the film's real power is its cinematography: when they say old DARK house, they really mean it, and the look of the film is just as disorienting for viewers as for the characters; particularly noteworthy is the scene in which Moore lectures Gloria Stuart, with their faces distorted by the bedroom mirror, and the sequence in which Karloff pursues the white-clad and wind-whipped Gloria Stuart with mayhem in mind.Viewers who expect "Universial Horror" fare will probably be disappointed by THE OLD DARK HOUSE, and director James Whale would create a still more memorable combination of horror and high-camp with THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTIEN. But THE OLD DARK HOUSE is an overlooked jewel of unusual quality: a sardonic parody of a famous theme, well played, filmed and scripted. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb sets and photography but ultimately just a well played farce</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director James Whale and his cast probably had a good time making this film. After the opening credits there's a "producer's note": 'Karloff, the mad butler in this production, is the same Karloff who created the part of the mechanical monster in "Frankenstein". We explain this to settle all disputes in advance, even though such disputes are a tribute to his great versatility.' So you're know what you're in for, at least modern audiences should. Back then it must have been quite daring to openly "expose" and perhaps even undermine the potential scariness of the film, especially Karloff's role as the butler. I think many executives at Universal frowned upon this as well, in particular Carl Laemmle Sr., but Carl Laemmle Jr. probably shared the same kind of humor as Whale, so they let him get away with it. The film is very loyal to J.B. Priestley's novel "Benighted" and took most of the wonderful dialogs and one-liners directly from the book. As one would expect from James Whale en co, the sharply written dialog is definitely one of the highlights with the best lines being handed to Thesiger, as in THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN. This supposedly being a send-up of Universal's horror conventions, it's not particularly engaging as a horror film. Eerie things do happen, absolutely, but they are so bizarre and sometimes so utterly over the top, that you either stop caring about the characters or simply lose track of the proceedings at all. But no complaints about the acting, especially the incomparable Ernest Thesiger who is a standout in a first rate cast. And the sets and photography are absolutely superb as is the whole atmosphere in general, largely due to the continuously (and well timed) stormy soundtrack, which greatly adds to the fun. Many have pointed out that Whale presents us some kind of parody of the horror movie or some kind of archetypal English household. This seems a very modern, almost anachronistic vision to me. What things did he attempt to mock or make fun of? Essentially THE OLD DARK HOUSE is a well acted sometimes very funny stagy farce with a horror atmosphere at best. He certainly had the last laugh because he probably never intended it that way, although most of the critical acclaim came after his death.A final note on the Special Collector's Edition DVD: Besides the obligatory stills gallery, nothing of particular interest. A six-minute interview with Curtis Harrington about him saving the original copy of the film. Good thing he did it but that's all we need to know. And truly worthless commentary tracks, James Curtis comments like he's reading a list with all kinds of facts about the movie. Suitable for a booklet, not for an audio commentary.Camera Obscura --- 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Whale of a time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is fully to James Whale's credit that he didn't lunge automatically for the horror genre's jugular after the lurch-away success of Frankenstein. Following his cynical romantic drama Impatient Maiden the urbane Brit next adapted JB Priestly's 1927 novel "Benighted' (or 'Cursed') for the screen.Though Priestly felt Whale had jettisoned the novel's psychological aspects along with the title, The Old Dark House does in fact adhere closely to the source material, with verbatim dialogue and even lighting effects ripped directly from the text. It must be said that the film, stark and stagey and suffused with dread, is extremely odd; it's also very funny. (Whale even sends up his own back catalogue with one character shrieking "He's alive!"); while its influence on the likes of The Rocky Horror Picture Show and Thundercrack, for example, is clear - another instance of one cult film paying dues to another.The plot is simplicity itself: on a dark and stormy night in the wilds of Wales, five rain-lashed travellers, including bluff industrialist Sir William Porterhouse (Laughton, in his first US film), his 'escort' Gladys DuCane (Bond), and playboy Roger Penderel (Douglas), seek refuge at the Femm family mansion.The Femms make the Addams' look like the Waltons. There's wry, effeminate Horace (Thesiger), who diffuses any sticky situation with the repeated exhortation "Have a potato." While his shrewish sister Rebecca (Moore, wonderful) is a deaf religious maniac who takes particular exception to Gladys. "You're silly and wicked. You think of nothing but your long straight legs and your white body and how to please your man. You revel in the joys of fleshly love, don't you?" Then there's the wizened, androgynous family patriarch, the 102-year-old Roderick (played, bizarrely, by Elspeth Dudgeon), and assisting, their mute alcoholic butler, Morgan (Karloff), given to random acts of violence and sworn to on no account unlock the Femm's dirty little secret from the attic - a cackling pyromaniac basketcase called Saul. As with Chekov's "hanging gun" dictum, we can be sure we'll meet Saul (Wills) by the third act.This being a Whale film, those searching for subversive undercurrents will be sure to find them. One character refuses to come out of a closet, Gladys reveals that "Bill likes people to think he's gay" and the line "My feet were wet - among other things" is her none-too-subtle remark following Penderel's romantic overtures. However, the most obvious reading of the film is as a wry indictment of British manners, and of starched-upper lips in the face of adversity.Each party (a cross-section of post-war Britain) has something to hide, and nobody is being straight with one other: as Porterhouse observes, "We've been sitting around for two hours talking, and what have we learned about each other? Nothing." There's genuine pathos in Laughton's performance as a lower-class businessman gone to seed ("When you've started making money, it's hard to stop") and in his peculiar relationship with his paid-for companion Gladys, the failed chorus-girl. ("If I were better at my job, I probably wouldn't be weekending with you.") In the Femms and in their visitors we might deduce the insanity of recent history manifested in a fractured, isolated nation still suffering the psychic fall-out from the Great War. And yet even as Whale skewers the woes of a generation, he strives for a happy ending; day follows night, as inexorably as peace, however fleeting, follows conflict.Such themes may have soared clean over the heads of 1930s Americans; though owing something to the Gothic tradition (and especially The Cat And The Canary) The Old Dark House - free from supernatural trappings - stiffed on release with US audiences who might understandably have expected something a jot more 'monstrous' from the great Whale.In fact, had the print not been discovered in 1968 mouldering away, unloved and all but forgotten, in the Universal vaults by Whale's friend and fellow director Curtis Harrington, The Old Dark House might never have seen the light of day again. There's something to be said for mucking about in vaults.On the 2006 Network DVD edition, there's a jolly commentary with Kim Newman and Stephen Jones, the pair bringing their wealth of knowledge of the genre to bear on the subject. "People have dinner, somebody goes upstairs, somebody dies" is a typical Newman aside, before he launches into an erudite exposition. "I think Whale obviously had a chip on his shoulder about the state of Post-War Britain," thinks Newman, while launching into a further discussion of Whale's homosexuality: "It's not a homophobic film, because it's in love with camp culture." Jones, meanwhile, finds it "hard to believe Ernest Thesiger wasn't gay". It's also mooted that Horace may be on the run "because of some public indecency, perhaps homosexuality," although Newman thinks he may simply be a draft-dodger. Of the cast, Newman gets the impression that "Karloff and Whale weren't on great terms," while revealing that Laughton and Whale definitely didn't get on; "they had different approaches to class, and sexuality and acting. Whale was very rude when he came over to Laughton's for dinner." Both concede the on-set tea breaks must have been interesting; all these actors had fascinating lives. Newman observes that "each time you meet a new member of the Femm family they get progressively insane. Even the name suggests there's something of the sexually ambiguous about them." Jones admits they might be reading too much into it through hindsight. In summary, it's noted that, as with all old Hollywood films, "any injury can be treated by a bandage round the head."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Collection of Weirdos</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First one carload of normal people who can't go on due to flash flooding stop in a Gothic horror house for food and shelter and then another. Strange doings are happening at the house occupied by the Femm family and their mute servant Morgan.You can't really say there is any kind of coherent plot to the unfolding events and plot for me is usually the one indispensable part of any film. But in this case I make an exception because obviously Director James Whale was having a little fun with the audience by now used to Universal Studios horror film products. Whale creates a film of dark moods and light banter among the guests who can't quite figure out what's with this family of weirdos.The Old Dark House marked the American film debut of Charles Laughton and Laughton overacts outrageously as does the whole cast in the role a bluff, overbearing, but essentially good hearted Manchester businessman who's got himself a Sir before his name and is right proud of it. This was also early work for Melvyn Douglas and Raymond Massey as another two of the guests. Boris Karloff plays the sinister and mute servant Morgan. Karloff had one of the great speaking voices ever in films and interesting that this and his break through role as the Frankenstein monster required no dialog. The Old Dark House is one great Halloween movie and listen close to the campy dialog that will tickle your funny bone if you don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before you see this, 'Have a potato'....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>They say there's nothing like your first time. But then you discover that that first time wasn't quite the first. Your first job? Yeah, we all want to say our first job was our summer job as a temp for some major corporation, but we forget the lame little job we had flipping burgers as a teenager, then there's your first kiss; yeah, nailing that Co-Ed was great, but then there's that ugly girlfriend you had in high school, and in some particularly sad cases of some unloved fellas I've met(Mostly virgins who still live with their parents, think the Holocaust didn't happen and complain about how 'South Park' keeps kids from playing outside during the day even though that show only comes on at night and kids don't watch it)their first kiss was basically with their mom(eeeewwww)since they never had any other kisses after that except of the Hershey variety. We do this because we don't want to admit how imperfect we are and how we had to struggle.'The Old Dark House'(1932) is like that. When discussing films featuring mad families in dilapidated houses, this film and Paul Leni's masterpiece 'The Cat &amp; the Canary'(1927) are the ones that film historians often like to call the first time. But sadly, those two films are only two in a long line of horror comedies featuring mad families that make the Manson's seem wholesome in comparison who inhabit run down shacks, castles and manors. However, as with our preoccupation for exaggerating our first time, film historians often call these two films the first simply because they are so good and there's a long history of dismal similar films that came earlier. Misplaced historical significance aside, 'Cat' and this film still helped to renovate and refine the clichés to such an extent that even if these films were not the first, they sure SEEMED to be.And it's no wonder those clichés seemed so new considering that this film was directed by James Whale. Once 'The Ace of Universal', then dismissed as a hack, then extolled as a genius after his death, Whale is a very controversial and underrated director even today for several reasons, not the least of which being that he was one of the first openly gay directors in Hollywood, which makes him a hero by todays standards for taking such a risk. Whale had made several excellent films like the original 'Waterloo Bridge'(superior to the more well-known remake), 'Journey's End' and 'Frankenstein'. Still, it is my opinion that he found his true calling working on this morbid little comedy. The eccentric characters, bizarre humor and inflammatory scenes(Yeah, I know there were plenty in 'Frankenstein', but not of the sexual nature they are here)on hand here would all be Whale staples in all his subsequent films, particularly the horror films he is most well-known for.The plot is simple: A bickering honeymooning couple and their cynical war hero friend Tom Penderell(Melvyn Douglas)are caught in an almost torrential(and very convincing looking)rainstorm while cruising through the hills of Wales. They are forced to take shelter in the manor of the eccentric Femm family.Did I say eccentric? That doesn't begin to describe these people.Brother Horace(Ernest 'Have a cigar, it's my only weakness' Thesiger)is an eccentric, nasty, apparently atheistic, effeminate man who seems to condescend people just by looking at them, with his few efforts at coming off as friendly making him more menacing, but he's a saint compared to his screeching, half-deaf, religious fanatic sister Rebbecca; who is so paranoid about the evils of sex she forbids the visitors from having beds!!(the delivery of the line 'NO BEDS!!!!' is priceless), and as with all fanatics, seems to be hiding some perversions of her own('That's some nice stuff' she says as she gropes the film's half-dressed heroine). Then there's the intimidating, growling butler Morgan(Boris Karloff, top-billed despite a minimal role), and 100+ year old patriarch Sir Roderick(played unconvincingly by a woman, who thankfully is still really old looking at least) and finally there's happy, playful little Saul: The family pyromaniac kept in an attic who gets loose when Morgan gets drunk.It's all hilariously creepy, and weak spots like an annoying bit part from Charles Laughton and a clichéd romantic subplot don't slow anything down. It's not so much a horror film so much as a comedic melodrama with Gothic overtones; but the influence this film would have on all ODH films that followed is clear. From the maniac in the attic, to the stranded travelers, to the seemingly cultured snob(Guy Rolfe's character in 'Dolls'(1987) is clearly a tribute to Horace)to the dessicated family patriarch(A character archetype most notably re-used as Grandpa from 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre'.)it all came from here.That said, ODH has many weaknesses. Several scenes drag on too long, and the ending happens so fast it's almost anti-climatic. The film's status as a lost film for so many years has also grossly inflated it's reputation. In fact, while I have said I feel the film is where Whale found his voice for his future films, it still is very much experimental, and hence; Whale's weakest film of his Four horror films. Still, when 'The Old Dark House' is your weakest film, you certainly have nothing to complain about!!!Enjoy, horror fans. It may not have started it all, but it certainly defined it all. There's also a 1963 remake by William Castle, which is nowhere near as good as this film, but very funny in it's own way and somewhat endearing, with a good mystery plot, I would review it, but I have no access to a copy as of now.~</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Near Perfect! Wickedly Entertaining Gothic Tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a wonderfully directed and uniformly brilliantly acted Suspense yarn with a heady mix of drawing room comedy. The now tired genre of stranding an odd-ball mix of characters in a trapped setting is given a comically fresh and wickedly mysterious lift by the vastly underappreciated director James Whale. This "ghost" tale, taken from the work of J.B. Priestley, and strikingly similar in tone and characters to his wonderfully melodramatic play, An Inspector Calls, is that rarity of mixed genres - Comedy &amp; Suspense, which we will no doubt not see the likes of again. This is the world of Noel Coward mixed with Edgar Allan Poe. The cast is chock full of stars - Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, Raymond Massey - and wonderful supporting character actors like Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore, Brember Wills and the brilliant gender bending turn from Elspeth Dudgeon. See this Movie!!! The direction is brilliantly atmospheric, the characters range from silly to delicously macabre, and the tension and mood are indescribably and wonderfully bizarre. I won't spoil any of the plot twists, although they are far less important to the success of this film, then it's mood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The late film historian William K. Everson once wrote that The Old Dark House is a film which, `almost invariably disappoints on its first viewing.' Mr. Everson is certainly right about that, for the first time I viewed this film several years ago I was very much disappointed. There are many reasons for this. The story, as reviewed, is quite tantalizing, as are the promotional still photographs, many of them showing Boris Karloff at his menacing best. The film was kept from public view for many years, adding an element of mystique to an already atmospheric, intriguing story. Finally, The Old Dark House was taken from J.B. Priestley's novel, Benighted, which gives it instant credibility with new viewers. In many ways, this is your standard travelers stranded together on a stormy night in a spooky old house story, but in important ways it is not. The film's strength is exactly what makes it seem slow and dull upon first viewing. What has happened is that director James Whale put together a masterpiece of mood, atmosphere and understated dread. Travelers begin to show up at the Femm house on the proverbial dark and stormy night. We learn quickly that the Femm's are an unusual lot, but as the story progresses we learn there is much more to them than just eccentricity, for a mad, murderous family member is locked away upstairs and we are not allowed to see him until the last few minutes of the picture. We have learned as we went along the burdens the Femm family bore and by this time we have experienced all of the major human emotions through the experiences of the impressive cast (among them Ernest Thesiger, Raymond Massey, Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton and Gloria Stuart, who 65 years after The Old Dark House was released, would become famous to a new generation of viewers with her wonderful appearance in 1997's Titantic). Love, anger, meanness, madness, fear and laughter are just a few of the emotional descriptions of what this fine group of players presented to us during the film's 75 minute run time. During the second viewing, one begins to pick up on the subtle nuisances and undercurrent of unease, lying just under the surface of the obvious awkwardness of the uninvited guests. Much is going on where not much seems to be happening, and therein lies the genius of Whale. Special mention should go to Ernest Thesiger, perfect as the effeminate, slightly unstable Horace Femm, the reluctant host to unwanted guests, and to the veteran Victorian actress Eva Moore, who portrayed his shrewish and dominating sister Rebecca. Boris Karloff's was not really a major role but it was an important one. As the quiet but dangerous butler Morgan, he is challenged to project an aura of instability and evil and this he does very well. There is too much to say about this film here, for more than any other film I have seen it is important to judge it in its entirety. I will say this: The mad brother was dispatched at film's end, the visitors and family members live to see the bright of day. The story was shot in semi-darkness in what is shown to be a very dark, foreboding house and 1932 technology is an asset, not a hindrance, to Whale's direction. Music is minmal but we hear and see constantly the crash of wind, thunder and lightning. All of the players were excellent and greater than the sum of their individual parts. It is interesting to note today that so many of them had lengthy careers after The Old Dark House was released, and many of them were not young then. Melvyn Douglas would star in another horror classic 48 years later, in 1980's The Changeling, and we all know what Boris Karloff did until his death in 1969. See this at least three time before passing judgment on it. I'm betting you will wish to see it a fourth and fifth time if you do. The saying, `They don't make them like this anymore,' is often overused, but in this case, true. Although 1982's House of The Long shadows is similar in certain respects, of The Old Dark House, we may say, `They only made one like this.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good atmosphere and direction but the story is simple, the actors lacking material and the film generally lacking a real punch until late in the day.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the midst of a terrible storm in rural Wales, a series of landslides cuts off the road and sees American travellers Roger Penderel and the Wavertons seeking refuge in an old dark house. The house is run by the Femm's ? an old man, his sister and the butler, the mute but intense Morgan. They are soon joined by Sir William Porterhouse and his showgirl companion, also cut off by the storm and they all sit to eat while the storm rages outside. Horace Femm warns about Morgan's violent drunken temper, putting everyone on edge; meanwhile the dark mood hanging over the house begins to unnerve the guests.Fans of modern 'strangers in an old house' horror films will probably wonder what all the fuss is about in this film, where very little seems to happen for quite a long time apart from people talking in the middle of a storm. This approach allows director James Whale to have some fun with his colourful characters and mostly this works, but on the other hand the 'romance' involving Gladys is just awful and doesn't make a lick of sense. What the very long build up does do well is to create a real tension just from the atmosphere alone. The soundtrack is a constant storm noise and I don't know what that must have been like in a cinema but it was very unnerving even using my home speakers. Add to this the dark rooms and general sense of foreboding created by the dark corridors, high stairs and candle-lit rooms.The characters are also a big part of this atmosphere ? from the comic maniacs of the Femms to Porterhouse and his roaring accent. Karloff may be the big name in the cast but apart from his presence he has little to do with no dialogue. Douglas is good but his romance with Bond is trite and unnecessary. Thesiger is funny and is well supported by Moore. Wills makes a good 'monster' of the piece and is suitably unhinged. None of them really shine but they do enough to stretch out the time without it becoming boring, while the tension builds.Overall this is a great film in terms of atmosphere but too much of the rest of it is too simple to really stick in my mind as a film I would come back to for repeat viewings. The script creates colourful characters to fill the time but not convincing people; the tension is well built but a bit more action along the way would have been appreciated. The direction and overall production is great (love the storm soundtrack) but it has not enough substance to it to make it a great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror/comedy masterpiece, a real classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently wrote a mock review of Ben Stiller's "Tropic Thunder" (a film I did not like) in which I facetiously said that "I have just seen a movie that's so awesome it raises awesomeness to a whole new level then proceeds to be so awesome that it raises awesomeness from that new level to another new level of awesomeness and proceeds to do this until I found myself in awesome heaven.".I never thought I'd use that in an actual review, but it fits this comedy/horror masterpiece from James Whale too well for me to miss the opportunity. "The Old Dark House" is perhaps the one film which I can watch over and over and over again and not tire of, the one film which suits all my moods, and it is a film which hits the right notes for 72 minutes and doesn't miss a beat. It's perfect. Absolutely perfect at doing what it wants to do.The plot (based on J.B. Priestley's debut novel "Benighted) has a cast of diverse and quirky characters descend on a very creepy, very old, very dark house in order to escape the storm raging outside. Inside they meet the family that occupies the house and many laughs and scares follow. That's all you should know before seeing this, because it's too much fun when you learn of the house's secret.Not only are these characters brilliant, but the cast is an absolute dream! You're saying I can watch Ernest Thesinger, Charles Laughton, Melvyn Douglas, AND Boris Karloff in the same movie? Not just any movie, either, but a James Whale 'old dark house' movie? My life is complete. I've always loved this movie, but I've tried pretending it's not a truly great film for too long. It is! It's a masterpiece from start to finish, a brilliant comedy of manners, an atmospheric and spooky tribute to the 'old dark house' genre (of which "The Bat Whispers" is another favorite), and a film that is so expertly photographed by Arthur Edeson ("The Maltese Falcon", "Casablanca", that is so brilliantly directed by the legendary James Whale, that is such a riot throughout that I find it hard to believe that anyone could possibly dislike this film.Expect a pure horror film and you might be disappointed. I expect that is the reason this isn't as popular as some other Universal horror features. "The Old Dark House" is, to me at least, the best film of the lot, and is just such an uproariously hilarious comedy and such a brilliantly self-referential tribute to the genre that I simply must count it as one of precious few films that I consider perfect. A real favorite, and boy is Ernest Thesinger beyond brilliant here or what?10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The eerie encounter with Saul</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surprisingly few things are necessary to produce a grand cinema sequence - provided that creative people are behind the camera. Here we have a stairway, a long table, some chairs, a big knife, a candle, two actors, thunder and lightning of a heavy storm.Penderel (Melvyn Douglas), one of five guests who came here to seek shelter, and Saul Femm (Brember Wills), one of five inhabitants of this old dark house, play the scene.The introduction of the supposed madman Saul is the most exciting moment of the film. Penderel knows that Morgan, the dumb butler (Boris Karloff), has opened the double bolted door of Saul's room (Morgan is drunk). First, Saul's crazy laughter is to hear...Then the face of an old, rather weak man appears out of the dark. The second surprise: he is well dressed. He comes down the stairs and Penderel is soon convinced that he isn't mad, just a helpless captive (?They are frightened of me. I know something about them.")But suddenly the situation changes. Saul points at the candle: ?Are you interested in flames?" ?Why...why...yes, yes I am, rather." ?I've made a study of flames." ?Have you? That...must be very interesting." ?I know things about flames that nobody else in the world knows." Slowly Penderel realizes what Saul really is: a dangerous pyromaniac. And he isn't harmless anymore - in a previous scene Morgan has turned over the dinner table and Saul has found a knife on the floor...The actors in this film are all good, but one is really outstanding: Brember Wills. It's such an incredible performance. This crazy laughter is truly unforgettable. The most convincing portrayal of a madman that I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>right up James Whale's alley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OLD DARK HOUSE comes from the peak period of the inspired director James Whale's Hollywood career and as such is worth seeing. The plot, based on a so-so novel by J. B. Priestley, centers on several travelers stranded in the Welsh countryside during a violent rainstorm who take refuge in a spooky house inhabited by an eccentric family. Whale brings this premise to life not only with stunning set pieces and eerie photographic effects but also by showcasing some of the strangest and darkly funny performances of the early talkie era. As he did with THE INVISIBLE MAN and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, Whale injects much humor into a menacing situation.There are two teams of actors: the travelers, a run-of-the-mill collection consisting of a bickering young couple (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart), their happy-go-lucky friend (Melvyn Douglas), later joined by an alcoholic businessman and his chorus girl companion (Charles Laughton and Lillian Bond). Then we have the weird Femm family which inhabits the house: Eva Moore, constantly surprising and delightful as Rebecca, the suspicious, ill- tempered, ardently religious sister of Horace (Ernest Thesiger), her elegant, cadaverous brother. Upstairs in bed is their 102-year-old father (brother in the novel) Roderic, played by a woman (Elspeth Dudgeon) with a glued-on beard, and locked away in another upstairs room is pyromaniac brother Saul, who must be restrained lest he burn down the house. The only member of the household who communicates directly with Saul is Morgan (Boris Karloff), the dumb and disfigured butler who goes crazy and violent when he drinks. The events which take place in the house do not hold up to much scrutiny. As with many Gothic horror melodramas set in old dark houses, too much mayhem goes on in one room while characters in another room remain conveniently unaware of what is happening on the other side of the wall, except when they need to know to advance the plot. There is far too much light on the proceedings, especially on the travelers as they drive through the rain drenched countryside in the middle of the night during a heavy storm. But Whale is obviously not interested in this kind of cohesion. He would much rather show us Moore's distorted reflection in a mirror as she babbles dementedly, or examine the table manners of a series of people at the dinner table as they dig into their roast beef and boiled potatoes, or show us curtains flapping away from open windows, or examine the minute facial manifestations of insanity accompanied by well timed claps of thunder and gusts of screaming, whistling wind. Some close-ups are shot from various angles in rapid succession, as in Whale's FRANKENSTEIN.Priestley's material allows Whale to indulge himself freely without overriding the source. Some of the most entertaining dialogue comes directly from the novel, including the "It'll rot" sequence with Moore and Stuart and Moore's religious rants. The film's entertainment quotient benefits from paring down the novel's long passages among the travelers in favor of extended scenes with members of the Femm family. But Whale did insert one bit that isn't in the novel. SPOILER ALERT: At the end of the novel two of the characters die. Whale twists the plot so that one of them is discovered to be alive, at which point Lillian Bond shouts feverishly, "He's alive! He's alive!" echoing Colin Clive's exclamation in FRANKENSTEIN.Whale was a master at conveying atmosphere and individual oddity. All of the films over which he had significant control bear these marks, and THE OLD DARK HOUSE, rather flimsy in some ways, is great fun for this reason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure early Gothic camp--almost terrific but creaky weird, too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House (1932)I saw this mostly because it is one of the early James Whale films besides the 1931 "Frankenstein" and "Waterloo Bridge" that has a decent appreciation out there. And it's a campy romp, quite fun and semi-scary, inky dark most of the time, and with a curious fun appearance by Charles Laughton, his first for Hollywood. It also features Boris Karloff again, in a much overrated role as the bearded "Morgan" who is quite mad and violent. The situation is classic?a terrible storm (depicted with wonderful intensity in the studio sets) forces a car of three travelers to seek shelter in a big old isolated house. Inside they find an eccentric old couple who are naturally surprised and only half willing to invite them in for the night. Their butler is the crazed Morgan, and upstairs are some moans from behind a locked door. Two more visitors arrive for shelter, their car also awash in the rising waters, and so we have a mix of people in something like a ship of fools situation, though it isn't played out so simply. As the five visitors get introduced in normal civil terms, the strangeness of the situation gradually unfolds. Some tricks that are now old are fresh here, like when danger looms, somehow the protagonists get separated from one another.It's a creaky film in more ways than one, and it doesn't have the power of "Frankenstein" or Whales's "The Invisible Man" the next year. What it has though is a kind of humor and casual banter that makes it more real. It's a very British affair (though an American film, put out by Universal) and it naturally did poorly in the US but terrifically in England on its release. There is a wonderful dry wit through much of it. And a warmth, sometimes when you least expect it. As well, the performances by Melvyn Douglas and Lilian Bond are at ease and charmed. Look for little lines, like when the dining room table is thrown over in a violet rage, Laughton later puts it upright saying, more or less: "That's no way to treat roast beef."See this? I actually say yes, for some offbeat amusement. Try to see it big enough and in a dark enough room to appreciate it all. There are enough twists and turns to keep anyone surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another film I've forgotten just how good it was until I recently re-watched it again. I have to say this is one of the best classic horror films I've ever seen. It's is bizarre, twisted and very good.Horace Femm - is the most sane of the insane Femm family, he's a very odd and nervous type of fellow. His sister, Rebecca Femm , is almost sane but very weird indeed. Saul Femm is the eldest brother and is completely insane pyromaniac. Sir Roderick Femm, the father, who is 102 and bedridden - he is a very creepy fellow but helps to fill in the story of the Femm family and their sick-o drunk butler Morgan.Yes this movie is definitely worth watching if you enjoy older horror stories involving insanity and creepy old houses.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needs to be seen more than once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My original review of this film was one of an unimpressed viewer. I had expected something with more action and plot, like Frankenstein (1931) or The Invisible Man (1933), and thus dismissed The Old Dark House (1932) as merely adequate. I saw it again recently and boy was I blown away! This is truly a film that needs to be seen at least twice. I imagine if most underwhelmed viewers gave it a second chance, they would love this one to pieces.You should not go in expecting lots of action. There is tension and atmosphere galore, but little in the way of action. This movie is about people stuck at a crossroads between the old and modern world. All the characters are interesting (well, except for Philip Waverton who's bland) and deal with their own personal issues, from Sir Porterhouse's loathing of the old money he believes led to the death of his beloved wife to Margaret Waverton's newfound realization of the inevitable decay of her youth to Roger Penderel's disillusionment caused by serving in WWI. The Femms are especially fascinating, and leave you wanting to know more about their personal history. I could discuss my own theories as to their back stories and motives all day long.This really is a film that leaves you wanting more. You wish there were another ten or fifteen minutes. You wish you could stay with all the characters a little while longer so you could learn how they got on afterward. I feel ashamed for ever thinking it was dull, for this might be one of the greatest horror pictures of the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a violent storm rages, five travellers in a remote part of Wales take refuge at a creepy looking mansion that's home to the "odd" Femm family...Weird, exciting and positively funny haunted house film with a top cast that's directed by one of Horror's greatest directors, James Whale. Based loosely around J.B. Priestley's novel "Benighted", the piece is further boosted by excellent camera work from Arthur Edeson and a screenplay that positively zips with memorable moments. Upon release in America the film was poorly received, yet unsurprisingly given it's British dryness, it was well liked in Britain. Even spawning an imitation in the form of The Ghoul, with both Boris Karloff and the irrepressible Ernest Thesiger again starring.The Old Dark House got a reissue in the late 30s after the Horror genre had been reinvigorated by the likes of King Kong, but sadly it fell off the radar once the rights had reverted to Priestley. The film then appeared to be lost for many many years until Curtis Harrington (director of such TV Horror fare like Killer Bees) found a print in the archives in 1968, and thankfully got the funding to have the film restored and preserved. Thus now, and as far from perfect as the print is, the piece can be enjoyed by anyone with a bent for such a unique blend of Horror &amp; Comedy.You have to be prepared for its kooky nature to truly enjoy the experience, but all being well The Old Dark House will continue to garner new fans with each passing year. The supreme director and marvellous cast deserve that at least. 8/10</fullReview>

Not that his was bad, but it was overshadowed by the remarkable acting of Ernest Thesiger. Other performances were also fun to watch.This movie was not lacking in atmosphere. It presented a very Gothic and eerie setting which was complemented by the sound of the thunderstorm and the used of lighting.

		<shortDescription>Extremes without Connection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is James Whale in his prime, for better or worse. The film was lost for generations before being reclaimed and restored, and for that reason is celebrated beyond its merits.What we have is a collection of stereotypical scenarios and characters. A stormy night. A collection of stranded travelers. A very spooky house, containing a family of deranged people and their even stranger butler.In turn, each character performs the most extreme behavior we can expect from their roles. It is hard to know at this distance in time how much humor Whale intended with this. Everything that could be over the line of serious presentation is. And the list of what is brought up is long: incest, drunken violence, blasphemy, denial, three distinct kinds of madness, gold digging, lust, instant infatuation, class struggle and damage. Sex in four incarnations.An interesting decision is that there is no hierarchy, no agent more prominent or in control than any other. The wheel spins and who is central at that moment is left behind the next. Even the character of the house is not exploited as many would. The set was actually shown off to better effect, I think, in a following film: Secret of the Blue Room. There the place had agency. Here it is just an accident of place.There is considerable art here in suppressing the notion of a master agent. This is a mystery like many of the period, but with no crime, detective or solution. Just everything else. It is a horror film, but with the terror removed. Sexy but hollow in the spots we normally would leer. All waves and no beach. Likely, this is his most personal film and it makes me wonder if we will ever welcome filmmakers like this back.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How many times have you seen a film where some people are driving along a remote storm lashed road , their car breaks down and they conveniently stop just outside a large dark house ? You know what happens next don't you ? The occupants end up the guests of people who hold a very dark secret and the guests end up fighting for their lives . This 1932 film by director James Whale adapted from the novel by JB Priestley is the film that started it all Being by Whale every academic film class will obsess about the homosexual subtext but is there actually any ? Someone is asked if they're musical which according to legend is a secret code in 1950s Hollywood asking if someone is gay but even if this was true this is supposedly confined to 50s Hollywood and would not be known to the inhabitants of early 20th century Britain . One character is referred to as being gay but the word would have entirely different connotations back then . In fact in 2013 the word " gay " seems to be the opposite word to " awesome " as in " Wow dude that/film/song/TV show was totally gay " It's interesting that one of the characters is portrayed as a religious maniac who describes people as heathens and one can't help noticing a running theme throughout Whale's work is that if often centres around man versus God . FRANKENSTEIN has this subtext as does THE INVISIBLE MAN where characters take boundaries of science too far and suffer for it . In this film it is surprising that it's not the person with the ecclestical psyche who is the villain and one wonders if critics should examine religion as the running theme of Whale's work rather than his homosexuality THE OLD DARK HOUSE didn't fare very well on its release and it's easy to see why . The pacing is very patchy and an audience who saw FRANKENSTEIN might be expecting to see more groundbreaking horror which doesn't really appear though of course its influence continues today . It's also a rather parochial film featuring a British setting , a mainly British production crew and cast complete with British regional accents and the film did much better at the box office in Britain than it it did in America</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A quality print on a big screen reveals glorious film-making.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a rare pleasure to see a clean print of "The Old Dark House" in a film theater today (Film Forum, NYC). Two earlier viewings had been of prints so poor that they were nothing but black or white-- no half-tones. Frames were so washed out or dark that the action was hard to follow, the chiaroscuro effects were lost, and perhaps worst of all, the actors' expressions nearly impossible to read. The clean print was a revelation. For example: I knew Karloff was a hulking threat as Morgan the beastly butler, but this time I could see the subtlety he conveys in Morgan's obsession with Gloria Stuart's character. Boris doesn't settle for an effortless leer. This was him at his Karloffian heights-- a drunken savage openly exhibiting animal desire for sylphic Stuart. It's not simple lust, it's a hellish combination of hunger and curiosity that erupts full-blown at the very first sight of her. She was horrified, and so was the audience. But we were also fascinated.Other IMDb critics have quibbled about the plot. Tosh! The plot is a mere vehicle for virtuoso film-making, and for performers as masterful as Karloff, as spellbinding as Ernest Thesiger, as Rabelaisian as Charles Laughton, as naturalistic as Lilian Bond, as debonair as Melvyn Douglas. "The Old Dark House" falls short of true greatness only because it is a genre film that reaches no higher-- but in its genre, it is seminal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Have A Potato!" - Great Haunted House Classic From Whale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that James Whale is one of the absolute greatest directors who ever lived, not only for the Horror genre, but for cinema in general. "Frankenstein" of 1931 is easily one of the most influential Horror pictures that ever hit the screen, and it is even outshone by the incomparably brilliant sequel "Bride Of Frankenstein" (1935), which (at least as far as I am considered) stands out as one of the most brilliant movies ever made. Then there is "The Invisible Man" (1933), another brilliant film with incredible special effects. "The Old Dark House" (1932) is the least known of Whale's four Horror films, and even though it does not quite live up to the brilliance of his previously mentioned other classics (in my opinion), this is yet another great and ingeniously atmospheric film by Whale, that no Horror-fan, no, no lover of film in general could possibly afford to miss! Due to an unexpected storm, five people seek shelter in an eerie old mansion in the middle of nowhere. The residents of the house are, mildly spoken, peculiar - Horace Femm (Ernest Thesinger) and Rebecca Femm (Eva Moore), a brother and sister as different and eccentric as they possibly could be, and their intimidating mute butler Morgan (Boris Karloff). As the evening goes on, things are getting more and more bizarre... "The Old Dark House" is genuinely creepy and has many moments of ingenious, sometimes black, sometimes just odd humor. The film has a generally dark tone and an exceptionally gloomy atmosphere. The performances are outstanding. The great Boris Karloff has a brilliant role as the creepy, drunk servant. Ernst Thesinger, who excellently starred aside Karloff in director Whale's masterpiece "Bride Of Frankenstein" is more than great in his role as the host Horace Femm. And all the other members of the cast, that includes Melvyn Douglas and the great Charles Laughton, deliver great performances too. Even though it does not quite reach the brilliance of Whale's three other Universal Horror masterpieces, "The Old Dark House" is an eerie highly original film with great characters and brilliant performances that is downright ingenious in many aspects. This is essential classic cinema from a golden age of Horror, and a must-see for every true lover of cinema! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hysterically Funny? Yes! All of it Intentional? I'm Not So Sure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What could have been a run-of-the mill thriller about the strange goings on in a creaky old mansion is instead transformed into a cheesy camp fest by the amazing James Whale. Although there are a lot of subtle "wink-nudge" moments in the film, I'm just not sure the movie was originally intended to be as subversive as it appears to be today.Standard scary movie setup here - a young, naive, and stodgy married couple, traveling with their single, wisecracking male friend, get lost in a fierce rainstorm and find refuge in the only place they can - a scary looking old house in the middle of the Welsh countryside.They're greeted at the door by a mute (and mutant-like) butler played by Boris Karloff, whose dialogue consists solely of a series of grunts and guttural noises. I couldn't help but think this character helped inspire the Addams Family's man-servant, Lurch. The house is owned by a loony brother and sister pair named Rebecca and Horace Femm (an obvious Whale shout out to the gay audiences of 1932), expertly played by Eva Moore and Ernest Thesiger. Eva is an over-the-top religious whacko who immediately accuses the gorgeous Gloria Stuart (yes - THAT Gloria Stuart from Titanic) of indulging in "pleasures of the flesh," all the while trying to cop a feel of the young beauty at every opportunity. Horace is a wimpy scaredy cat who's too afraid to walk up the stairs to the top floor of the house and fetch a candelabra.Before long, two more stranded travelers show up at the house - Sir William Porterhouse, who, as played by Charles Laughton, appears to have done nothing but consume them for the past 20 years, and his plaything, Gladys DuCane Perkins (Lillian Bond). We know immediately that Gladys is a "bad girl" because she starts dancing like a gin-swilling flapper as soon as she gets in the house. Within 15 minutes, however, she's enraptured and tamed by the wisecracking bachelor Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas) and falls head over heels in love with him.Gladys tells Penderel that Porterhouse likes people to think he's "ever so gay," even though he "expects nothing" from her. I wonder if Whale was paralleling Laughton's off-screen persona here, since Laughton was known to be gay, even though he was married to actress Elsa Lanchester (the female monster in Whale's Bride of Frankenstein).There's an absolute gem of an uncomfortable dinner scene involving all the characters, with Rebecca and Horace trading snipes across the table like George and Martha in Who's Afraid of Virgina Woolf. And Horace's repeated directive to each of his guests to "have a potato" is priceless.Eventually, the movie unveils a crazy brother locked up in the attic, a 102-year old man (played by a 61-year old woman named Elspeth Dudgeon) tucked away in a remote chamber, and the requisite murderous rampage as the guests run and hide to save their lives.Some of the more unintentionally funny scenes involve Gloria Stuart's highly theatrical panic as she tries to escape the lustful clutches of Karloff's mad butler character, and Lillian Bond's declaration of unconditional love for Melvyn Douglass while hiding with Stuart in a closet as Douglas battles outside with the crazy brother. The only clichéd thing the women in this movie don't seem to do is faint when confronted by the horror before them.Then there's the day after all the chaos with Horace gleefully gliding down the stairs and greeting his guests with a chipper "good morning," apparently forgetting that his home was ransacked and set on fire and that his brother was killed just the night before.Although probably intended to be a scary movie when it was released, it's really not scary at all. Whale's excellent use of light and shadows helps bring a cold, eerie atmosphere to the proceedings, but the film is really more of a parlor piece that's engaging primarily because of the quirky characters populating the screen.See it for the novelty aspect, but don't expect to be chilled by the experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a weird, wild film! Thrilling conceits, nonstop visual charms--this is my first time seeing this film, but I imagine such startling, delightful effects will not diminish with many viewings. An obvious genius is at the helm, with an irrepressible, meticulous, sardonic imagination; I would have to see the Frankensteins again since I haven't seen them in so long, but I think I would prefer this one to them. There is a verve to this film such as one finds in 30s Renoirs, and in Vigo's two masterpieces (albeit mannerist and theatrical), with a director's assuredness as well to match those. The five denizens of the old dark house are not to be believed--forget the Renfield of Tod Browning's Dracula--these are the "real" loonies! Ernest Thesiger &amp; Eva Moore are wonderful, and a wonderful pair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just short of a full score due to the silly and remarkably rapid romance but it doesn't occupy too much celluloid and can in no way ruin one's enjoyment of this fantastic film. Still a bit creepy after all these years but now it is more the tremendous performances and the wacky dialogue that thrills. Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore are the brother and sister from hell who reluctantly take a collection of storm hit travellers into their very dark abode. I don't know which of them I enjoy more but suffice to say when either is on screen, they steal the frame and that's with Charles Laughton and the lovely Gloria Stuart vying for our attention. From the impressive opening with the bickering couple and a car careering dangerously about waterlogged lanes to the final denouement with even madder creatures having been discovered about the house than we have met hitherto, this is one great ride - and I'm smiling now just thinking about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>All Over the Place, But in a Good Way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This strange, strange curio from the mind of James Whale is more like an exercise in free association than it is a movie. A group of travelers gather in a big spooky house to shelter from a raging storm, and what follows is a bizarre plot in which events and actions occur with no relation to one another, back stories are hinted at but never explained, and characters every once in a while stop to deliver soliloquies with seemingly weighty psychological or philosophical underpinnings (about the horrors of WWI, for example, or about sins of the flesh) that aren't ever fully explored by the script. But in spite of, or maybe because of, all this random kookiness, the movie works a kind of magic spell. Whale's direction helps a lot; he brings a great deal of humor, all very British and dry, to the Gothic tale, and keeps it teetering on the brink between horror film and comedy. This makes the movie uneven, but it also adds a refreshing element of unpredictability.The cast includes a very young Charles Laughton, Melvyn Douglas and Gloria Stuart, and, at the time the closest thing to a big star thanks to his performance in "Frankenstein" a year earlier, Boris Karloff as a horny, hirsute and menacing butler. He charges around harassing the ladies, and the juxtaposition of his hairy, physically imposing and quite masculine appearance to all of the prim and proper English gentility around him brings a distinctly barbaric and sexual charge to the film.This one's weird. I liked it, yet at the same time can't bring myself to really call it a good movie.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) Caught in a torrential downpour Philip Waverton, Raymond Massy, and his two passengers his wife Margaret, Gloris Stuart, and best friend Roger Pederel, Melvin Douglas,drive their way through the rain and darkness. All of a sudden the road is submerged in a avalanche leaving them stranded in what at first seems like in the middle of nowhere. Making their way through the rain and mud they approach this creepy and dark house along the washed out road and and are greeted at the door by Morgan, Boris Karloff, the scary-looking house butler. Reluctantly allowed to stay overnight by the man and lady of the house Horace, Ernest Thesiger, and his hard of hearing and shrill sister Rebecca Femm, Eva Moore. The three house guests soon have some company when Sir William Porterhouse and his girlfriend Gladys DuCane, Charles Laughton &amp; Lilian Bond,who are also stranded in the heavy rains show up to spend the night there. At first nothing really seems to happen at "The Old Dark House" with the five travelers more or less getting to know about the crazy Femm clan by just watching them.Later that evening when Philip and Margaret stumble into the clans elderly patriarch who strangely looked and sounded, for all intents and purposes, as if he were it's matriarch Sir Roderick Femm, Elspeth Dudgeon. Sir Rodrick tells the stunned couple that the house is cursed with madness and murder. Sir Rodrick also tells them that the creepy and powerful Morgan is there mainly to keep his crazy and unstable son Saul, Brember Wills, from breaking out of his room that he's been kept locked up in for years and tun the place and every one in it into an inferno.Boris Karloff more or less repeats his role as the Frankenstein monster as Morgan the butler even though he's a real person not a jigsaw puzzle made up of human spare parts with a criminals brain in his skull. Morgan actually tuned out to be quite a good guy trying to keep the crazy and murderous Saul from breaking out of his room and doing in everybody in the Femm house.Saul himself was by far the biggest plus of the movie even though we never get to see, or even know that he existed, until the very end of the film. Harmless and meek looking at first Saul showed his true colors, flaming red &amp; orange, when he started in on his love of fire as well as his distorted obsession with the books of Samuel and Kings in the Old Testament.Having at first a friendly talk with Roger Saul completely goes bananas as he tries to set the Femm house on fire and at the same time murder the startled Roger by running him through with a large kitchen knife. Wild ending with Roger and Saul having it out in a life and death struggle with the much maligned Morgan trying to stop the carnage. Morgan gets on the scene too late to save crazy Saul not just from Roger, who ended up being left for dead with his head smashed in, but from himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE OLD DARK HOUSE (James Whale, 1932) ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had watched the other three James Whale horror films - FRANKENSTEIN (1931), THE INVISIBLE MAN (1933) and BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) - several times during my childhood, but THE OLD DARK HOUSE had always eluded me. I finally had the opportunity to watch it (on my brother's Satellite TV) in August 2000, incidentally on my birthday, and I obviously loved it immediately. Different from practically any other Universal horror film of its period, this is one of the undoubted gems among them and it actually gets better with each viewing - though still one of the least known of the 1930s classics, probably because for a long spell it was presumed lost (it was only through the efforts of director - and Whale's friend - Curtis Harrington that a print eventually surfaced in 1968!). Of course, being largely confined to a single bleak setting, it lacks both the visual splendor of the two Frankenstein films and the optical tricks of THE INVISIBLE MAN - thus appearing decidedly low-key, even uneventful (a spoof on plot-heavy "old dark house" films which deliberately contrives to have very little going on - until the bravura finale!), but it more than makes up for this with the many vivid characterizations and exquisite performances, Whale's stylized but extremely confident direction, marvelous production design and camera-work and the brilliant, endlessly quotable dialogue.The strangeness of the setting and the offbeat characters which inhabit the place (particularly Boris Karloff's mute butler Morgan and Brember Wills' unforgettable pyromaniac Saul) elicits a disturbing aura that's difficult to shake off and quite unusual for the time. It's very probable then that, coupled with the lack of genuine monsters or the expected haunted house trappings, the film didn't do much business at the box-office back in 1932: even so, its influence was immediate - as can be seen from THE GHOUL (1933), also with Karloff and Ernest Thesiger, another foray into "old dark house" territory and, ironically, also considered a lost film until fairly recently! Besides, the film itself was actually more comedy than horror (though there were a number of comedy-thrillers in the Silent era, most notably THE CAT AND THE CANARY (1927), none have achieved its level of subtlety and accomplishment) and the cast was mostly unknown at the time, with Karloff - the nominal star - virtually unrecognizable in a secondary role! Still, it's one of the most remarkable ever assembled for one film: Karloff (Morgan may not be an exactly juicy role, but Jack Pierce gives him a memorable 'look' nonetheless), Melvyn Douglas (who followed his role here with a similar one in next year's THE VAMPIRE BAT - partly shot on the same sets!), Raymond Massey (his Hollywood debut), Charles Laughton (ditto), Thesiger (his second most memorable film role), Gloria Stuart (quite sexy on account of this being a pre-Code film, and a more rewarding role for her than that in THE INVISIBLE MAN) and Eva Moore (like Thesiger, hilarious - especially during the unforgettable dinner sequence - but also convincingly menacing towards Stuart). Even the lesser known actors namely Elspeth Dudgeon (credited as John Dudgeon [!] and, like Thesiger, she also appears in BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN - Massey and Stuart's visit to the asexual patriarch Roderick Femm could well be my favorite sequence in the entire film), Lilian Bond (making for a rather charming heroine as opposed to playing the dumb stereotype) and Brember Wills (truly one of the unsung great villains of the silver screen) leave an indelible impression.The film plays out like a stage play, but Whale's inventiveness (including odd images such as a close-up of water dripping down the back of Raymond Massey's neck and the distorted reflection of a rambling Eva Moore) and the assured lighting keeps theatricality at bay (discounting the various eccentric characterizations, of course). The occasional viciousness still packs a wallop: Karloff's drunken punching of the window pane, Massey smashing a lamp over Morgan's head and the latter's tumble down the stairs on account of this, Wills' knife-throwing and vampiric assault on Douglas. Despite its reported faithfulness to J.B. Priestley's original novel, "Benighted", it is still arguably James Whale's most personal film - and, according to the Audio Commentary, only THE GREAT GARRICK (1937) is similar to it in his career! Ultimately, it proves to be the perfect marriage of Expressionism and Surrealism - perhaps the two art movements I admire the most and which, in cinema, found their ideal medium; with this in mind, THE OLD DARK HOUSE has firmly established itself as my all-time favorite movie, and that's saying a lot! While sharper than the Kino Edition, the Network R2 DVD is unfortunately a lot more battered, and wouldn't really be worth double-dipping on if not for the Audio Commentary by the ubiquitous Kim Newman and Stephen Jones; they come up with a number of rather astute insights into the plot: the fact that Douglas is probably in love with war-buddy Massey's wife Stuart, or that the Femms' strangeness could well be the result of incestuous inbreeding (with the members of the family getting crazier as they go along, from the brutish Morgan to the utterly unhinged Saul). Incidentally, despite the terrible reviews it has garnered, I'd still like to catch up with William Castle's 1963 Hammer Films remake, even if mainly for curiosity value...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great cast, great atmosphere but boring first three quarters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House mixes a top rate cast with a terrific atmosphere. The atmosphere is thick with howling winds, driving rain and dark shadows. The cast features Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey and Boris Karloff fresh off his Frankenstein success (the tape I bought even has a disclaimer in the beginning.) Gloria Stuart is also featured in her younger days and is a stunning knockout. The Femm family is deliciously macabre. Eva Moore as Rebecca Femm runs around spouting religious jargon while making Stuart's life a living heck. Ernest Thesiger as Horace Femm meekly is afraid of the night and more afraid of what is upstairs. Roderick Femm (played by a woman strangely) lies upstairs, laughing uncaringly at the danger that may be unleashed that night. The problem with The Old Dark House is that the first three quarters of the movie are mind numbingly boring other then the brief interplays between Femms and guests. The guests huddle around the fire and basically waste a huge chunk of the movie that could be spent utilizing the great talents on hand. Charles Laughton is particularly wasted as he eventually sleeps while an unnecessary love affair and a fight with Morgan are going on. Karloff is also somewhat wasted as Morgan just doesn't have much to do other then drinking and fighting. Thesiger also should have been used much more and much more effectively. The movie is saved by it's final portion and the terrific performance of Brember Wills as Saul. The tension builds until his eventual appearance (for some reason everyone gets locked up leaving Melvyn Douglas alone.) Wills is dynamite as the laughing, psychotic Saul and steals the movie. Other then his scenes, most of The Old Dark House isn't really even that much of a horror movie more than it is the story of a group of people stuck on a stormy night telling their life stories and even finding love. It's really just an extremely interesting collection of characters who are unusually candid about things and who have such loud personalities that they unfortunately relegate the crazy Femms to the background. This element makes the movie too watered down and cozy until the ending when it really gets fun. Had the movie been written with more suspense in the first three quarters, had it made the Femms more the central characters then the guests and had it been less cozy throughout, it would definitely be one of the greats because everything was right there. Instead it's just solid.7.1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>creaky old horror opus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale's country house mystery (which seems to have had more than a passing influence on the Rocky Horror Show!) gets its unfortunates in from the rain, wind, and landslides, into the house of the weird Femm family and their drunken butler Morgan.The family are close to caricature at times - the sullen sister Rebecca (Eva Moore) who is conveniently deaf when it suits her and oppressively moral; the camp and nervous brother Horace (wonderfully played by the snipey Ernest Thesiger); the high-voiced Sir Roderick, the bed-bound patriarch (played by a woman and credited as a man); and the nutter in the attic, brother Saul (an unnerving performance from Brember Wills).Morgan is of course Boris Karloff, mute, resentful, and dangerous. However even he is capable of some tenderness, as is seen in his interaction with Saul late in the film.The visitors are variable - Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart are OK but a little stodgy as the young Waverton couple; Melvyn Douglas plays the joker Penderel, who has a line for everything; Charles Laughton (a Yorkshireman in real life) plays a Lancashire self-made businessman; Lilian Bond plays a chorus girl tagging along with the industrialist who falls (improbably) for Penderel.As a story, The Old Dark House falls flat. It isn't even equal to the plays by Priestly which could be called comparable, such as Dangerous Corner. But Whale does some impressive things with the camera - Rebecca is filmed through distorted glass, Margaret Waverton does shadowplay on the wall, Saul strokes a candle flame while talking of the icy properties of fire to Penderel, and then there's that big door which keeps closing itself, those close-ups of Morgan's eyes, and the interplay between the characters - often just two at a time, giving us a chance (within just 70 minutes) to get some sense of all of them.Creaky now for sure, this film is still of historical interest, although not as much as the Frankenstein films. Laughton and Douglas always add interest to a piece, and they do here, but what story they and the other characters have is spread very thin.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frankly, any movie that can turn the line "Have a potato..." into one of the funniest lines in cinema history has got a thumbs-up from me. This movie is the epitome of camp horror: drunken butlers, pyromaniacs locked in the attic, mad old grannies, thunderclaps and lots of underlighting. And I have to say it works tremendously well if you don't take it too seriously. All the performances are wonderful, especially Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore as elderly siblings who seem to spend the entire movie seeing who can overact the most. For someone who loves laughing at old black-and-white horror movies (Nosferatu is best) it was strange for me to see one that was intentionally funny. But it really is. From Morgan's overdone make-up and grunting to Rebecca Femm spooning pickled onions onto her plate, it really is hilarious. So, if your open-minded and enjoy watching people ham it up in brilliant roles, then sit, back watch this film and I think you'll enjoy it. Just don't expect to be scared by it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nightmare classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about 12 years old when I first saw "The Old Dark House" at the Annex Theater on Manhattan's East Side. Which wouldn't be unusual except that within a few days, the Annex Theater had vanished. It never turned up again in an ad or movie listing. Which made it a curiously appropriate venue in which to watch one of the great horror movies of all time. The film opens on a car slogging through a torrential rainstorm whose occupants seek shelter in a lonely manse rather than risk plunging off a cliff. The people in the house are all mad. Ernest Thesiger is a menacingly genial host. His sister makes it clear that she hates visitors; "there are no beds" she keeps screeching. The butler, Morgan (Boris Karloff) is a mute servant who is only homicidal when he drinks. Which he does whenever there's a storm. Somewhere on the third floor, there's a locked door to keep a madman with a butcher knife from running loose. It's clear that the wayfarers,led by Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton and Gloria Stuart may not live through the night. J.B. Priestly's screenplay is both literate and frightening while James Whale (of Frankenstein fame) turns up the terror with wonderfully skewed camera angles and effects. In short, "The Old Dark House" is a rarity...a genuine horror classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>James Whale is one of the great classic horror filmmakers. He directed the two best Frankenstein films, "Frankenstein" (1931 version) and "Bride of Frankenstein", among a few other films, and one of his best has to be "The Old Dark House".When watching this film, I was actually pretty surprised at the amount of humour hidden in this underrated horror classic. I'd consider it a dark comedy, as well as being a very atmospheric horror classic. What is so funny about it? Well, it is so absurd and bizarre at times, and there is a lot of funny dialogue, that I couldn't help but laugh during some scenes.However, the film isn't all fun and games, it is also quite chilling at times, and the whole film contains a very creepy atmosphere. The thunderstorm and creepy old house create a wonderful setting for all the insanity that goes on throughout the course of the film.But, the film is not perfect. I felt that it could've really used a bit more of Boris Karloff. Whenever he's on screen he's absolutely amazing and creepy, but he isn't on screen much, and certainly isn't in the film enough to be first billed. Also, some of the performances aren't very good (although the performance by Charles Laughton is very nice), but, it was the 30s, right after the death of the silent film era, so a lot of the performers in these 30s films were not very used to delivering actual lines in a motion picture, so you can't really blame them.Overall, this is a great, spooky, and funny horror gem that I enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Probably the first thought that comes to a classic movie fan's mind while watching this movie is 'They don't make 'em like that anymore'... It's so beautifully atmospheric, so scary in the good old-fashioned way and at the same time so entertaining that it almost seems from another world to us today.And what a PERFECT beginning for a classic mystery movie: a quarreling couple and their philosophical friend get stuck in a thunderstorm in the middle of nowhere - with only an old dark house to seek refuge. They're still joking sarcastically when they knock on the door - but as soon as the butler's grim face shows as he opens it, the fun is definitely over for quite a while, and the creepy part begins; it's no one else but Boris Karloff, once more portraying a dangerous half-wit, who's staring at us and at the visitors...Then we get to know the rest of the inmates: a gentle, but frightened-looking host and his weird, hostile, bigot sister, and upstairs, lying on his bed and giggling wickedly, their 102-year old father. The house itself, of course, is the very model of a 'haunted mansion': creaking doors and stairs, no electricity, the wind blows through every hole...Then again enters a breath of humor, in the shape of jolly Englishman Charles Laughton and his lovely, cheerful companion Lillian Bond; a bit of philosophizing follows - but very soon the terror is back: someone - or something - is hidden up in the attic; something DANGEROUS... And from the moment on that the terror is released, everybody in the house are fighting for their lives...Not only are the performances, every single one of them, outstanding, but the direction is perfect, too: very unusual optical effects are used to enhance the suspense, which grows more and more, culminating in a really FIERY climax - and the most MOVING ending of a classic mystery movie I've ever seen...In short: "The Old Dark House" isn't at the top of the list of classic mysteries by pure coincidence - it's most certainly an UNPARALLELED masterpiece of scary movie history!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One dark and stormy night,a group of travelers are stranded in the Welsh countryside at a sinister mansion. The door is opened by a mute butler named Morgan (Karloff). The travelers, two men and one woman, are soon greeted by the matriarch of the family, who owns the house, Rebecca Femm. She is accompanied by her strange brother, Horace Femm. Later the group is joined by another couple. As the evening grows, the visitors learn there are two more people in the house: Sir Roderick Femm, an invalid; and Saul Femm, whom no one wants to talk about.As in the novel, most of the movie consists of the various characters sitting around talking. Whale is able to make these static scenes shine by using his actors, who would go on to other brilliant roles in cinema. Charles Laughton steals the show as the good-time nouveau rich. The director even managed to keep some of his monologues from the book, where you learn about the pain his jocular exterior is hiding. The only character who didn't make the transition very well was Melvyn Douglas, who comes off as a playboy. In the book, he was still shell-shocked from WW1.As this was an early sound movie, the medium shots work very well. It gives the actors plenty of time to deliver their lines while not having to lug the huge cameras behind them. There's no music score.It was a real shock to realize the Gloria Stuart in The Old Dark House was the same Gloria Stuart who dropped the diamond in The Titanic. What a difference 65 years can make!But the real scene stealer is Saul Femm, a character from the book who didn't have any lines in it. In the film version he's one of the creepiest madman imaginable. He makes his entrance slowly down the stairs and claims to have been imprisoned wrongfully in the house. But a few minutes into his cry for mercy you quickly realize he's a full-blown lunatic. I don't think I've ever seen such a well-rounded pyromaniac.Ernest Thesiger, who would go on to play Dr. Septimus Pretorius in Bride of Frankenstein (1935), is my favorite character. You soon learn he's on the run from the police and is hiding out in the house. We never do find out why he's wanted by the law. He plays the role with just the right amount of droll humor to keep it moving. To bad the didn't use the best line he had in the book:'We'll play Truth,' said Penderel. 'It's just the moment for it.''So they have turned it into a game now, have they?' cried Mr. Femm, in his thin, bitter voice. 'It was high time they did.The movie didn't do too well when it was first released. Which is a shame because it's the best example I can find of Universal horror movies from the 1930&#x2032;s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very stylish horror film. The production may creak with age but the characters are unforgettable. There's really no plot, except for the stranded normal folks getting shelter in an old, dark mansion peopled by Addams family rejects. (Looks to me like that TV series may well have been inspired by this film.) And what a bunch of weirdos the Femm family is. There's the feuding brother and sister? a scarcely loving pair. She attacks him like a snarling tiger, while he pecks back like a snooty rooster. And get a load of the Karloff butler, looking and sounding like he just left a Neanderthal cave. And buried under a ton of bedclothes is Sir Roderick, a whispering character of unknown gender or species. Finally, would you believe there's a family member that even this loony crew is afraid of?it's old fire-loving Saul, kept behind lock and key upstairs. Between them, the whole question of evolution is placed in serious doubt. Pity the poor unfortunates who drop in to take shelter there.No doubt about it, director Whale has a unique sensibility that hasn't been duplicated since. It's an odd combination. The horror is there but it's slightly off-center, like there's a private joke lurking somewhere behind the scenes. He certainly had a feel for oddball characters like the fey Thesiger (brother Femm) and the very un-grandmotherly Moore. But he also knows how to blend in conventional characters to create a skillful mix. All in all, the movie may be a creaky antique, but it's a good one to dust off now and again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whale under the surface</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remarkable film of the genre defined by the title of the film itself. While it can be enjoyed as a sub-genre of horror, it operates on several levels- not the least of which is what lies beneath the surface: Whale's humorous, tongue-in-cheek and slyly guilty pleasure in the homosexual sub-text. One is so amused by the arch (and delightful) characters and eerie atmosphere, it may escape the attention that the family is called Femm, the director and at least one of the stars are gay, and then there is the dialog! Whale clearly had a hoot making this movie and his affection for it draws us in. Perhaps the best of the 'old dark house' movies and one for which any film buff must have affection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"This house is safe".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After making "Frankenstein" the previous year, filmmaker James Whale's next venture back in to the genre was the edgy horror comedy "The Old Dark House" which its conventions; dark, stormy night, howling wind, poorly lit mansion, stranded travellers and loonies are an often relied on cliché. What made it stick out was its sharp, witty humour where character's share biting conversations despite some stilted expressions. The performances are pretty neurotic, where you have the leering Boris Karloff donning a beard as the memorably slow-witted, but brute butler. When he gets drunk, watch out. Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore are quite animated as the edgy siblings. In a small, but effective role is Brember Wills as the crazy brother who's kept locked away. Then there's the unlucky guests played by Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond and Gloria Stuart. Plenty of atmospheres are staged, from the striking shadowy decors to the effective sound effects as Whale's creates a breezy and quirky eccentric mood to it all. Its fun with a wicked sense of humour and the creaky plot is rather straight-forward, but sometimes it can be sidetracked and slowed down by episodic forced dramas."This house gives me the creeps."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a wonderful film! An ideal mixture of camp and eerie creepiness, this black-and-white horror flick is a joy to behold. What a gifted film-maker James Whale was. An atmospheric, creepy setting rendered more-so by excellent lighting and the wonderful, idiosyncratic characters make "The Old Dark House" a delight. This fine film amply deserves a thorough restoration, re-mastering and re-release. The sound quality is muddy, so turn up the volume. If you frequently have trouble enjoying films with less than ideal sound quality, watching this film could be frustrating for you. In the extra features, you can watch a brief recounting of how this movie was saved from disintegrating into oblivion. I am very glad it was saved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karloff and Whale - At It Again!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the success of Frankenstein, director James Whale released a romance film before returning to horror, once again calling upon the mastery of Boris Karloff. Supporting Karloff in this classic haunted house mystery is esteemed actor Ernest Thesiger who also appeared in Bride of Frankenstein ? sadly the great merger of talent would end there, as it was the last film the two would work together on. The lineup also presents further points of intrigue, such as Gloria Stuart (famous actor throughout the 1930's '40's, best remembered has as the old woman in 1997's Titanic ? "Old Rose"), Melvyn Douglas (another big name for the time, and oddly enough, played Senator Carmichael in 1980's The Changeling), and Charles Laughton. Before knowing the plot of the film I was already sold on the concept?mostly because I enjoy the work done by James Whale so it was only natural for me to conclude that this film would be great also.The story opens with three people riding in a car in the middle of the night through a rain storm. Margaret and Philip Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart) are traveling with their friend Mr. Penderel (Douglas) when they come across a dark house that serves as a welcome commodity to avoid the severe weather conditions. They are met instantly by a large, lumbering, hulk of a man named Morgan who's a tenant at the house along with Horace Femm and his sister Rebecca; an odd pairing of individuals who exude eccentricity. Shortly thereafter, two strangers also arrive to seek refuge ? Sir William Porterhouse (Laughton) and Gladys Perkins. After several friendly exchanges, the night passes on and the group dissipates while strange events begin to unfold as a result.There isn't too much to intellectually debate or praise about this film ? so feel relieved for all of those who chose to be spared of my long- winded rants and raves. This one is what I like to refer to as the, "Hey?what's going on here" type of haunted house story, filled with a bit of mystery and chilling atmosphere. The black and silvery tones set the tone just right; certainly a terrific combination alongside the older methods of acting and innovative cinematographic techniques that were refreshing for such a young time in cinema. I wouldn't classify this tale as a "who-dun-it", as there are no twists or cerebral attacks to consider at the height of the climax?just a fun story that typically isn't very scary but entertaining nonetheless. The horror films that I've seen directed by Whales also feature a hint of comedy ? certainly not moments of full-on slapstick or even contrived entries of dialogue to reflect this, but rather a slick and clever way of mocking certain scenarios a character would find him or herself in during a time of terror. Surely the performances are a bit hammy and chalked up?but I believe this to be intentional ? of course it requires close attention to notice those thinly-laced comedic passages, but they're there. This offers something of substance rather than straight cheese, much like the work done by William Castle in the late 1950's ? House on Haunted Hill and The Tingler from 1959 are evidence of this. Don't let my comparison fool you! I am a fan of the films aforementioned, but I am merely pointing out that it's nice to see an approach to horror without the use of so many gimmicks while retaining a respectable level of ham that's heavy enough to choke you out during a nice Easter meal. I highly recommend this one, though, it's great fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Old Dark House" is one film which is often overlooked in the horror genre. It is not as famous as James Whale's other successes, notably his two "Frankenstein" films and "The Invisible Man". Nor does the movie feature one of Universal's famous monsters - the closest there is to a monster in this film is a hulking, scarred butler (played by Boris Karloff). Yet "The Old Dark House" is one of Universal's best films and one of it's most influential. It spawned countless other "old and spooky house" films (none, however, would better this one of course), established Charles Laughton as one of Hollywood's most versatile actors and gave Karloff his first top billing. From the atmospheric, rain-drenched start to the tense, fiery finale, "The Old Dark House" remains one Universal classic that deserves repeated viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>William K. Everson Was Right</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In one of his final books, William K. Everson, the film historian, wrote that you'd be disappointed watching this film for the first time, but that it would get better with every viewing. Yes. It's the first of many 'stranded strangers staying overnight in an old dark house on a rainy night' movies. But it's not a horror film, it's not even a comedy, and nothing 'scary' ever really goes on. The fourth time was when I began to enjoy it--after watching the original and then the two audio commentaries; maybe having had a few beers helped.For whatever reason, now I could finally focus on the sheer artistry of auteur director James Whale's film: the sets, the lighting and amazing photography, the atmosphere, the direction and the great ensemble cast, with shining moments from Charles Laughton, Brember Wills and Melvyn Douglas, Eva Mann and scene stealer Ernest Thesiger. Raymond Massey, Gloria Stuart and Boris Karloff add to the colorful cast that keeps the film moving right along.If you don't believe me, try watching Melvyn Douglas's next film 'The Vampire Bat' (1933) and then this one and then you'll see how 'The Old Dark House' is an Oscar winner by comparison; its superior crafting raises it up as a quality film even though it lacks horrific, science fictional or supernatural content.I'll give it a 7.NOTE: Gloria Stuart, who has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, was nominated for Best Supporting Actress in 'Titanic' (1997). Raymond Massey had a full career of famous roles, but noteworthy for us genre fans are his roles in 'Things to Come' (1936), his Karloff imitation in 'Arsenic and Old Lace' (1944), his role as James Dean's father in 'East of Eden' (1955) and the rifle shooting Colonel in 'Night Gallery' (1971).Charles Laughton was Dr. Moreau in the first 'Island of Lost Souls' (1932), and was amazing as Quasimodo in 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' (1939). Ernest "Have a po-tay-to" Thesiger was Karloff's butler in 'The Ghoul' (1933), in addition to his immortal Dr. Pretorius in 'The Bride of Frankenstein' (1935). We all know Boris's films, but 'The Mask of Fu Manchu' (1932), 'The Body Snatcher' (1945) and 'Targets' (1967) need to be seen.</fullReview>

Although he gets top billing, Karloff is given little to do as a large, mute butler. Douglas, Laughton, Bond, Stuart, and Massey are all terrific as the guests who don't know what they have gotten themselves into. Moore is good as the woman of the house, irritated to be playing hostess to strangers, as are Wills as her pyromaniac brother, and Dudgeon as her dotty father. However, it is Thesigner who steals the show in a delicious comic performance as the cowardly host. Whale, in perhaps his best film, creates a wonderful atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Arguably the first horror-spoof?but perhaps a little too-knowing for its own good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought I was going to love this: I am a massive horror fan, a massive fan of the Golden Age of Hollywood horrors in particular, a massive Boris Karloff fan, and a massive fan of director James Whale himself (I even liked James Whales version of the musical "Show Boat"?and I really hate musicals!) and yet "The Old, Dark, House" just felt flat to me. On paper too, it sounds great: a group of people stranded during a fierce storm in a remote, sinister house where, after meeting the creepy drunk Butler (Karloff) who answers the door, they are introduced to the odd-ball Femm family. And sure, the Gothic atmosphere immediately grabs you and effortlessly insinuates a feeling of abstract threat?and yet nothing comes of it, the storm clears up, and that's the last of that! I'm sure that part of the problem comes from the billing of this movie as a horror ? yes, it reads like a horror, yes it has (the then) newly discovered horror icon Boris Karloff in it, and yes James Whale had directed "Frankenstein" the year before and would go on to direct the stunning horror landmarks "The Invisible Man" (1933) and "The Bride of Frankenstein" (1935)?however it really should be considered a horror spoof along the lines of "Carry on Screaming" or "Young Frankenstein". It's true that dry wit, one-liners, and camp flourishes are certainly characteristic of all of James Whale's work, but in "The Old Dark House" it seems that rather than complement the horror they up-stage it and lead it down the road to farce. In itself, this could actually be viewed as no small achievement considering that the film was made in 1932 and seems to impart to Whale a certain prescience about the cliché nature of the horror genre. However, I think this image of prescience owes more to Whale's theatrical aloofness and cautious distance from the horror genre. Sure, these days horror movies have been done to death (no pun intended) but in 1932 there was still certainly a lot of ground to tread (as creepy house movies "The Haunting (1963) and "Suspiria" (1977) aptly demonstrate) and I can't help feeling that "The Old, Dark, House" is a camp snob's jibe at something he feels is beneath him. Shame.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Whale is more interested in the dysfunctional family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a fan of "The Old Dark House" upon first viewing but I did watch it at four o'clock in the morning while drifting in and out of consciousness. Upon second viewing, I remember why. The film introduces the main characters in the worse way possible: Crowded into a car, driving through the Welsh countryside in the middle of a hurricane. The driver and the female co-pilot bicker while the guy in the backside provides unhelpful quips. This endears them to the audience.Once they get the titular house, things pick up. It's fairly obvious James Whale is more interested in the dysfunctional family. The religious fanatic sister argues endlessly with the rationalist brother. (Played by Ernest Thesiger in what was, no doubt, a test run for Dr. Pretorius) Soon, another group of travelers wander in. The film goes about pairing the men and women from both groups with each other. Film scholars looking for gay subtext: Feel free to speculate on why Charles Laughton, closeted in real life, plays a man who lives with a woman he has no sexual interest in. The romantic dialogue is actually rather realistic and Melvyn Douglas and Lillian Bond have good chemistry, likewise Gloria Stuart and Raymond Massey. The dialogue is catty but never laugh-inducing. While the film is considered a landmark horror/comedy, the comedy doesn't register much for me. The climax is wrapped up a little too neatly. Aside from two characters I'll get to in a minute, none of the demented family are a real threat. The house guests are never in much danger. Over all, "The Old Dark House" doesn't quite gel for me.But still, there are some fantastic moments. The house is a creepy location. The flat stone walls are often painted with shadows of staircase rails, looking like bars on a cage. The diner table scene, featuring a fantastic sarcastic prayer from Thesiger, is the funniest moment. Karloff doesn't distinguish the deaf/mute/alcoholic/prototype for Lurch character of Morgan too much from the Frankenstein Monster but is, undoubtedly, an unnerving presence. The scene where Stuart, glamorous in a white nightgown, is threatened by the drunken monster is classic stuff. The centennial patriarch of the home is played by a woman in drag in an odd, memorable decision. The best scene in the movie has got to be the moment when Sister Femm berates Stuart for her "sinner's lifestyle," the camera frequently cutting to her distorted reflection in a series of mirrors.The movie has a real ace up its sleeve for the final act. Sol, the crazed brother locked up in the attic, appears suddenly at the end. Though playing the victim at first, he makes it abundantly clear just how insane he is very quickly. A near miss with a thrown knife and the pyromania that follows are an appropriately exciting finale. To be perfectly honest though, the image of a heart-broken Morgan picking up the dead body of his brother is almost heartbreaking and evokes the same monster love Whale showed in his "Frankenstein" films.I'm sure Whale delighted in making such a queer, in both meanings of the word, film. The combination of macabre elements, humor, and family politics doesn't quite mesh with but the cast is rightly lauded and several singular moments stand out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Dark House (1932) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me begin by saying that if you've tried this movie out and were underwhelmed in some way by it, wait a while and give it another chance. I say this because THE OLD DARK HOUSE often leaves first-timers with such a feeling, including myself once upon a time. It is one of those offbeat and eccentric movies which actually can reward with each subsequent screening. Considered a lost movie for many years, Curtis Harrington worked effortlessly to rescue it from oblivion, and we Universal Horror fans owe a great debt to this man for his dedication.Basically, a group of travelers during a hellish thunderstorm on the road have little choice but to seek out shelter in an eerie house populated by a family of crazies. Since the director was the enigmatic but great James Whale (who helmed FRANKENSTEIN, BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN and THE INVISIBLE MAN too), his style here is expectedly wild and unorthodox. There are all sorts of tongue-in-cheek oddities and creepiness to savor if you approach this in the right spirit. Chills, shadows, much crashing thunder and lightning and dread, accentuate the mood.The cast is wonderful, beginning with Ernest Thesiger for my money. He plays Horace Femm, a sniveling pawn of his domineering older sister, Rebecca, who are the proprietors of the house. Charles Laughton is a hoot as a boisterous loudmouth, one of the unwanted guests who forces himself on the Femms. This was Boris Karloff's first Universal horror film after he'd wowed audiences as the monster in FRANKENSTEIN, though he's somewhat under-used here playing a bearded mute butler with a tendency to grow violent when unpleasantly drunk. Give this classic a chance on a dark and stormy evening. If it doesn't work completely for you the first time, wait until the next rainstorm and give it another try. It pays off stronger with each viewing. ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Truly bizarre film about two sets of travelers who seek refuge from a storm and landslide in an "old dark house." Of course they would have been better off in the hostile outdoors rather than seeking refuge. The house is peopled by a strange brother and sister (Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore) and their "mute" butler?Boris Karloff. The first arrivals are a married couple and their caustic friend (Raymond Massey, Gloria Stuart, Melvyn Douglas). The second couple (not married) are played by Charles Laughton and Lillian Bond. The brother and sister are hilariously bizarre. She keeps screaming, "No beds! They can't have beds!" while he politely offers his guests boiled potatoes, from which Massey seems to pick out bugs. The intruders are blithely unaffected by the bizarre hosts and butler and seem quite stolid in their expectation to be put up for the night. The problems really start when the electricity goes out and they need to seek out the lamp from upstairs. That's when they discover the locked doors and the whimpering calls from another room. Something must have been cut from James Whale's film because little makes sense from this point on. Massey and Stuart have an interview with the owners' 102-year-old father (played by the actress, Elspeth Dudgeon), and the "other" brother, Saul (Brember Wills), gets loose. So while Laughton sleeps and Douglas and Bond fall in love, Massey is left to fend off the lunatic brother. Then the film just sort of ends with the rising sun. There is no resolution to anything, and several characters just disappear. Regardless, this is a landmark film, utilizing scares and humor in a way that would set the course for decades to come. The actors are all good, chief among them Thesiger and Moore (who steal the film from the stars (Karloff, Laughton, and Douglas). Stuart (in a slinky gown) and Bond (shoeless) have fun as the leading ladies; Dudgeon and Wills are deliciously over-ripe in their acting. All good fun, but I sure wish the storyline had been more traditional and conclusive. But the film is filled with many quotable quotes and funny bits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old Dimmly-Lit House: A great, yet forgotten James Whale horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House is by far the least known of James Whale's horror films, it was somewhat poorly received upon first release in 1932 and it quickly vanished from all screens large and small and was very much at risk of becoming a "lost film" - fortunately, thanks to Curtis Harrington, The Eastman House and the employee's of a certain film vault in New York, that didn't happen.The Old Dark House, as the title would have you believe is something of a spookhouse or haunted house film, but only there aren't any spooks, specters or ghosts at all, just a bunch of old eccentric people; a family known as the Femm's and their disfigured, mentally unbalanced brute of a butler, "Morgan" (played by Karloff). The Old Dark House may not be a true spookhouse film, but it certainly has the visuals and vibe of one, a brief run down of what to expect: lost and weary travelers, an unrelenting thunderstorm, an old dark house (now there's a surprise), loud gales, lots of shadow play, diminutive pyro-maniacs, ancient invalids of indeterminate gender, roast beef and potato's, and many a vinegary personality. I find this obscure film to be extremely intriguing and fascinating for several reasons and it absolutely drips with a certain creepy storm-battered, wind-whipped atmosphere, which is something all fans of horror should appreciate.A brief run-down of the plot goes as such: Three weary traveler's are lost in a torrential rainstorm out in the wet and rainy wilds of Wales, after nearly getting their car stuck several times and avoiding a landslide by the slimmest of margins, they see lights a head - enter The Old Dark House. As they knock on the front door a disfigured, though dapperly dressed, mute brute of man comes to the door and immediately the eccentric characters from within the house begin to appear, first Karloff (Morgan, the butler), then Thesiger (Horace Femm), then some old bent-over, deaf and vinegary lady (Rebecca Femm, Horace's sister) who's not at all happy to have these unexpected vistors among her. First some gin, then a rather opulent dinner, during which two more vistors appear out of the rain, a boisterous Englishmen and a amateur chorus-girl. But the most eccentric occupants of the house are yet to emerge, Horace Femm is the only one of them who has any degree social grace and is for the most part "normal", because he HATES living in what is a very abnormal house. The five travelers are up against, the storm, the dark (as the lights eventually go out, thus it's more like The Old "Dimmly-Lit" House) and a deranged and drunken Morgan and his old friend Saul; who turns out to be the battiest of them all - they keep this crazy little old man locked-up on the on top floor, otherwise he tends to be - a homicidal arsonist. But because of the drunken idiot that is Morgan, Saul eventually does get loose and bad thing's happen. Saul (played by the little known Brember Wills) is one of the great old coots of cinema, he's very short, bearded and balding, with dark shifty eyes, a mischievous crooked smile and a hilariously shrill laugh, a complete eccentric... among other things. Until the rain stops, it's up to the travelers to survive whatever the Old Dark House throws at them, because that's whats really holding them hostage, the rain - and it's a constant presence until the end.The Old Dark House proves to be, very potently, a clinic of quirky characterizations, black humor, witty dialog, shadow play and a definite display of mastery in creating an overall pervasively foreboding atmosphere throughout the dimly-lit corridors and confines of the unwholesome old dark house. The film is filled out with a great cast of about a 50/50 mix of American and British actors, several of which are true bonafied scene-stealers such as: Thesiger, Douglas, Karloff, Moore and Wills.I love the off-beat quirkiness that this film's characters have in immense abundance, that combined with a constant stormy atmosphere make for an extremely invigorating experience (you definitely want to watch this movie at night, that's the "right" time to do so). As usual James Whale's direction is virtually flawless, he always had a great intuition on picking the right people for his movies. If I have any criticism's for this forgotten and vastly under-rated classic, I gotta say I never did care much for the very last scene, as it contrasts too much with the rest of the movie and I find it a bit awkward and an abrupt scene to end things on.One final detail (involving the sound FX department), one that very frequently colors the soundtrack of this film and adds greatly to it's atmosphere: the wind. If your ears are even remotely attentive to what's going on, you'll quickly deduce that the wind you're hearing isn't real wind at all. Evidently in the early-30's recording wind was still something of a technical issue, that had still yet to be resolved. So instead they used this particularly distinctive "fake wind" sound effect, that's highly characteristic of that era. I don't know how they made it, but it's definitely man-made and I for one really Love how it sounds. It was only used in movies made from around 1930 to about 1935, the very next year The Invisible Man would also use the exact same highly characteristic faux wind effect. The short time-period that this distinctive sound FX was used, several decades ago, certainly seems to qualify it as something of a long lost and dust-covered Hollywood relic (or maybe even a long-lost ice cream flavor). I don't know about you, but for me it's a pleasure to hear that vintage sound effect. Man-Made Faux Wind.</fullReview>

Who could ask for more: a mysterious old "couple," their monstrous manservant, an androgynous, bedridden old patron, and a psychotic pyromaniac locked away in the attic. Throw in two groups of weary travelers and let the games begin. Once again, James Whale tells a Whale of a tale and Karloff, though wordless throughout the proceedings (as in James Whale's first FRANKENSTEIN feature), manages to conjure up some powerful emotion(s); his struggle with three men (Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey and Charles Laughton) reminds one of his wrestling match with Colin Clive and Edward Van Sloan in FRANKENSTEIN, as well.

		<shortDescription>James Whale's weirdest film and a visual treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of director James Whale's most offbeat films along with "Bride of Frankenstein" (IMHO his masterpiece). It's based on the J.B. Priestley novel and it was filmed during the Pre-Code Era. I'd say it's a mixture of horror film, spoof and black comedy...in some aspects it's related to "Arsenic and Old Lace", although it has a darker mood.On a very stormy night, a group of travelers find shelter in an eerie and scary welsh manor, inhabited by the "weird" Femm family, and there begins a quick chain of events (the film lasts only 72 minutes) until the film's conclusion. The weary and wet travelers include Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart as a married couple who are traveling through the country with happy-go-lucky friend Mr. Penderel, played by Melvyn Douglas. Other travelers who arrive to this Huge House, are Charles Laughton, playing a rich businessman of humble origins with his lover, Lillian Bond, who's great and very sexy in her role of a joyous chorus-girl.Then we have the Femms: Religion fanatic Rebecca Femm, who has an obsession with "sinners", expertly played by sinister-looking Eva Moore; her wishy-washy brother Horace Femm, played by the great Ernest Thesiger, who impersonated "Dr. Pretorius" in "Bride of Frankenstein"; 102 years old Sir Roderick Femm, who is played by actress Elspeth Dudgeon, who's listed in the cast as "John" Dudgeon (creepy character!) and "seemingly harmless" psychopath and pyromaniac Saul Femm, played by Brember Wills.Boris Karloff deserves to be mentioned apart, who impersonates the scarred butler, Morgan, who lusts after Mrs. Waverton (Gloria Stuart), perhaps because she gets to wear a sexy 1930s low-cut dress, the type which pre-Code Jean Harlow wore.Whale's direction is excellent. I was especially impressed with the shot of the front of the spooky old house in which the Femms reside as seen from the eyes of the passengers in the car. Whale liked to use a subjective camera, which was unusual for many early thirties movies. The camera is the viewer as that viewer moves through the scenes.Best of all was the late Gloria Stuart's commentary on the Kino DVD, which was excellent. She is such a pleasure to listen to as she reminisces about the movie, and talks all about everyone involved. I never would've known anything about the brilliant actress Eva Moore if it wasn't for her great commentary. She provides so much insight, and is so funny and charming at the same time. She also talks about other things, and other aspects of her career. It's almost like having a conversation with her, she's that relaxed. She speaks very highly of James Whale, and says that he's the best director she ever worked with. She points out different aspects of his filming, especially his use of shadows. She says that making this movie was the high point of her career, and that she never made another movie that she enjoyed working on as much as this one. Take that James Cameron!Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sitting-room drama with elements of the macabre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A steadily and evenly paced film with few highs or lows of action. A couple and their friend are cut-off by flooding and a mud slide forcing them to seek shelter in a nearby house. There they are joined by a wealthy industrialist and his vivacious companion.The occupants of the house pay little attention to the strangers, continuing with their complex and personal family feuding. You get the feeling that the occupants of the house are so set in their ways and focused on their personal history, that it is disconnecting them from the current modern world. This is mirrored physically through the lack of electricity in the house. The arrival of outsiders tips the balance of power and upsets their routine with violent consequences.The camera-work in this film is quite interesting, it has a unusual visual texture, a type of early film-noir. The older members of the cast really carry this film, the younger actors (perhaps more used to silent films) somewhat over-act (ham-acting).Not a terrible film, but too evenly paced for the audience to feel much tension.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy film. Revels in the art of the uncanny.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When describing films that are overly saturated with elements of a certain theme, the phase "X for X's sake" is often used. 'Gore for gore's sake' or 'Violence for violence's sake', you get the idea. I am tempted to use the phase "Creepy for Creepy's sake" when describing the film, although I don't mean it in a negative way. The Old Dark House doesn't grab you by the head and smash your face down inside a pie of creepiness. Rather the creepiness is all around you from beginning to end, though it may not always be subtle.It is a simple story ? a violent storm forces two sets of travelers to seek shelter at and old, dark house. The inhabitants of the house are quite strange, as would be expected. There are several subplots that arise, and some of these are awkward. But never mind, the purpose of the film is not to tell a thought-provoking story with a compelling plot. Instead, it is to revel in the art of the uncanny. It succeeds in its goal with dark and chilling atmospheres, crafty camera-work, and its effective use of shadows. Some of the characters are humorously unsettling, even by today's standards. I would like to go more in depth and describing some of them, but that would require me to tread too far into the forest of spoilers and I don't want to do that. Oh and there's the screeching of the wind! Gotta love that! Read more of my review at my blog, which is found in my profile</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A real gin and potatoes kind of picture!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm so glad I recently discovered this movie. It was so old, but so much fun. I reckon the best way to watch movies like it is to catch the oldest scratched-up prints of them with bad sound on questionable late night TV stations. They seem to be almost made for that kind of romantic creakiness. I loved how much wit it had, how it had such a great sneaky dark humour about itself that makes you feel like it's inviting you to a spooky party. It really turned out to be one of the best of the very old horror films that I've ever seen. And I personally don't really enjoy all that many 30s pictures.. It gave me a bit of hope that my taste in movies could be a little more cultured than I thought! You might not think it's the right word for a 1932 movie but I had such a blast with it! It was like unearthing an ancient treasure, the way it was so old that I didn't know who any of the actors were, and how it was so black and dusky-looking gave it an almost dreamlike quality... Its classic Gothic overtones were enchanting to me, I felt strangely drawn to it within moments and it grew on me right away. Just my type of film I suppose.. It 'spoke' to me! It simply has oodles of what a good scary story needs more than anything else: Atmosphere, such a perfectly wonderful midnight storm constantly raging outside, and those ever-present sounds of driving rain and whistling shrieks of wind gave it an almost immersive effect I thought, it made me feel something like I was in that dark house myself. And oh my but that really was such a terrifically creepy old stone house. Like the plot, it was taken straight out of a great old horror tale. I loved everything about it, it was like one of those walk- through ghost houses that you sometimes get at amusement parks, the rooms were like furnished crypts, just magical... And just one more time this may be frightfully old, but it has some surprisingly intense scary scenes where the mood suddenly stops being quirky for a second. I loved the setup and how it played out, it was so perfect to me. People trapped in a storm find a foreboding craggy manor and take refuge in the bizarre abode of decayed grandeur, and then they meet and engage with the stranger still eccentric family of the damned! My favourite thing about it is the weird characters. For me the scenes where the guests interact with the Femm clan are the best parts of it. It was very character driven. I especially like Ernest Thesigar as Harris Femm, he was hysterical! Any of the low budget or perhaps even amateurish qualities only add to the film's rustic appeal. The pacing is odd and the story is vague, but regardless of its faults and as simple as it is, it succeeds admirably in delivering a joyously fun and sinister quality that more than lives up to the humble promise of its title. So I was just very happy to have found this, it was completely new to me and I loved it. Don't think I'll ever be seeing too many more quite like it. An eerie delight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delicious ghoulish fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a cast as great on paper as The Old Dark House and that it's directed by James Whale, The Old Dark House promised much and had all the makings of a good comedy-horror. The Old Dark House was not just good, it was great. It is perhaps not as good as Frankenstein, Bride of Frankenstein and The Invisible Man but it is right up there. The plot admittedly is creaky and somewhat episodic, but with The Old Dark House it wasn't about the plot. And because the atmosphere, visuals, script and cast were so good it is easy to ignore any misgivings you have on the story. The costumes and sets are very Gothic and look truly beautiful, and the photography is crisp. The music is appropriately haunting, any sound effects add to the ghoulish feel to the film and the atmosphere is genuinely creepy. James Whale directs with a security for comedy and horror, and succeeds in making the characters colourful and allowing the cast to enjoy themselves. There is lots of black humour in The Old Dark House, and especially with the Femms you have a ball chuckling at the very least at what you're hearing. And the horror elements are deliciously ghoulish, nothing noticeably predictable. The film is only about 70 or so minutes long, but crams so much in and makes everything work without feeling rushed through, which is a great achievement. The cast are just splendid, Ernest Thesiger steals the show in a brilliantly creepy performance as a very effeminate character. Though magnificently terrifying Boris Karloff, ravishingly beautiful Gloria Stuart and hilariously aggressive Eva Moore come very close and they do match him in how much they make an impression in this film. Melvyn Douglas does suave and puzzled to a tee, Charles Laughton does overdo it but looks as though he's having the time of his life, Raymond Massey is a lot of fun and Brember Wills' speech likening fire to cold blades is enough to creep anybody out. Elspeth Dudgeon's patriarch portrayal is unconvincing though. To conclude, delicious, highly atmospheric, wonderfully written and acted and most of all fun. 9/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangers in the Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE OLD DARK HOUSE (Universal, 1932), directed by James Whale, from the novel "Benighted," somewhat inspired by Universal's silent "mystery house" comedy thriller, "The Cat and the Canary" (1927), is actually a worthy follow-up to the studio's earlier success of FRANKENSTEIN (1931), reuniting its director with the then unknown actor, Boris Karloff, whose role as the Monster established him into an overnight star. Before the film gets underway with its opening credits, with slow title fade-in similar to the start of THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (1925) starring Lon Chaney, viewers are treated with this Producer's Note: "Karloff, the mad butler in this production, is the same Karloff who created the part of the mechanical monster in "Frankenstein." We explain this to settle the dispute in advance, even through such disputes are a tribute to his great versatility." Plot summary: Philip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart), a bickering married couple, driving along a country road with Roger Penderel (Melvyn Douglas), their pipe-smoking friend in the back seat, struggle through a huge thunder storm forcing them to seek shelter in an old dark house following a severe landslide. Pounding on the door, they are greeted by an assortment of unusual characters: Morgan (Boris Karloff), a bearded mute butler; Horace Femm (Ernest Thesigner), the eccentric host; and his outspoken, hard-of-hearing sister, Rebecca (Eva Moore). During their gathering at the dinner table where Horace offers his guests to a potato, the Femms are met with two additional guests in from the storm: Sir William Porterhouse (Charles Laughton), a cockney businessman, and Gladys DuCane (Lillian Bond), his traveling companion. The night soon brings questions to the mysteries ahead for the guests, including their meeting with Sir Roderick Femm (John "Elspeth" Dudgeon), 102-year-old bedridden man, and the imprisonly insane Saul Femm (Bramber Wells).At first glance, THE OLD DARK HOUSE is a disappointment, coming off like a filmed stage play once the characters settle inside the old dark house. Keeping the film from looking theatrical, Whale allows for its cameraman (Arthur Edeson) in keeping the characters and scenes in full focus from all different levels and angles. On the plus side is the presence of Boris Karloff, the selling point of the film itself. In his first starring role, addressed in numerous occasions as an "uncivilized brute" and "devil," who communicates only in grunts and gestures, has even less to do than he did in his breakthrough performance in FRANKENSTEIN. As the other characters dominate the 72 minute story, Karloff's presence is nearly forgotten until his occasional reappearances, one as he goes through a drunken frenzy. Even more disappointing by today's standards is its current poor picture and audio quality. Not as bad as some third generation video copies, but one in serious need of restoration. Granted, the story is set mostly at the dark of night, with characters visible while carrying candle plates. But in its present state, the darkness appears much darker than originally intended, makes certain scenes difficult to speculate what's actually occurring.After repeated viewing, THE OLD DARK HOUSE can be appreciated through its director's visual style of comedy and suspense and how he gets the viewers to accept these unusual assortment of characters as depicted. Melvyn Douglas, early in his career, stands out not as the traditional wooden romantic interest, but that of a sophisticated ladies man who, after a brief fling with chorus girl, Gladys DuCane (actually Gladys Perkins), follows with a kiss regardless of she being a companion of another, then proposing marriage to her. This guy really works fast! Charles Laughton, also early in his career, too, holds interest in his extremely obnoxious, chubby individual speaking very strongly like a British cockney. Ernest Thesigner, the immortal Doctor Pretorious in Whale's THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN (1935) is very creepy throughout, standing upright like a human ghost with sinister eyes and very pale complexion to keep its attractive blonde guest (Gloria Stuart), one "not easily frightened," to run off in a big scream. Stuart's frightful encounter with Karloff is reminiscent to how his "Monster" approaches the heroine, Elizabeth (Mae Clarke) in FRANKENSTEIN. Another interesting aspect is how constant sounds of thunder are used in place of underscoring, and spoken dialog heard in echoes of darkness, simply add to the mystery of the old dark house.Unlike many films of the 1930s and 40s featuring such horror greats as Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi or Lon Chaney Jr., THE OLD DARK HOUSE was one that was never broadcast on commercial television on such popular Saturday night editions as "Chiller Theater" or "Creature Features." Those familiar with its title had to rely on the source of the 1963 William Castle's comedy-thriller of the same name staring Tom Poston to some concept of the original. Fortunately, what was once considered a lost film, eventually surfaced again in crowded revival houses in 1975, and decades later, availability to video cassette and DVD from Kino Home Video; and cable TV broadcasts on American Movie Classics where it premiered May 1995, and Turner Classic Movies starting in March 2006.In spite of its pros and cons, THE OLD DARK HOUSE benefits from its fine assortment actors properly placed in their oddball portrayals, but most of all, something of a forerunner to the 1960s TV comedy series, THE ADDAMS FAMILY, in which its butler, Lurch, could very well have been inspired by Karloff's Morgan.

		<shortDescription>A Whale Of A Time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sorry for the above rotten pun; James Whale himself would have come up with something far wittier. The Old Dark House is the second of his four horror masterpieces and is probably less well known than his two Frankenstein epics and Invisible Man; but it is also one of his most personal and in-jokey films, remaining a delightful concoction of humour and ghoulishness.The plot is pretty simple, three travellers (Gloria Stuart, Raymond Massey and Melvyn Douglas) are stranded during a terrible storm at a remote house whose inhabitants are both eccentric and dangerous. The demesne is occupied by the Family Femm, and we are quickly introduced to Horace (Ernest Thesiger), Rebecca (Eva Moore)and a mute,brutish butler named Morgan (Boris Karloff). But they are not the only members of the house, and therein lies the mystery....Later our stranded travellers are joined by two other storm- shelterers, Sir William Porterhouse (the irrepressible Charles Laughton), and Gladys Ducane (Lillian Bond). And what a magnificent bunch of actors they make. Whale is such a skilled craftsman he can round out his characters in just a minute or two of screen time.A simple story then, but the magic is in the telling. Whale gives us a marvellous scene between Eva Moore and Gloria Stuart as the latter is changing her dress, cross cutting into close-up through a distorted mirror on Moore's vicious old crone - "That's fine stuff but it'll rot", she says, pointing to Stuart's chic evening dress. Then she touches her prey on the chest "That's finer stuff, but it'll rot too in time." There is more to this scene but I won't spoil it.Look out for the hilarious dinner scene, and the acerbic exchanges between Rebecca and Horace. There is, I suspect, a little more than meets the eye to their relationship.And over everything lurks Boris Karloff's drunken, lustful butler. Karloff's a delight, going on the rampage after a bender, and letting out the black sheep of the family. Lets just say an actor by the name of Brember Wills steals the whole movie even though he makes his entrance very late. His 10 minutes or so of screen time are truly unforgettable.All the cast are terrific, though the romantic interest scenes are possibly the only weak point in the film. Even Whale can't build up a convincing romance between two characters in such a short space of time, but who's quibbling? The Old Dark House is masterpiece of black comedy. For me it's the last word on Old Dark House movies - you know the kind! Long neglected by Universal - until the late sixties prints were not in circulation; I watched this yesterday on Network's UK DVD for the first time (must have seen it six times in total) and the restoration is marvellous. This is a great movie, one of the best in the horror field ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful, fun film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always a pleasure to watch, 'The Old Dark House' is a brilliant piece of work. Other than expecting a pure horror film, I cannot understand why anyone would be disappointed with it.So much of what became cliché both in pure horror films and in the 'scary/funny' sub-genre, got its start in this film. (In a way, it's like watching 'Stagecoach.' It may seem clichéd at first, until one realizes that this is only because every following western followed ITS pattern.) The creepy black and white cinematography, eerie sound effects and wonderfully decrepit old mansion combine with a dream cast and an incredible group of bizarre characters to form a classic. Of course the dialog is also outstanding, with just enough tongue-in-cheek effect to lend the film a delightfully campiness three quarters of a century later.Gloria Stuart, 65 years before 'Titanic,' was a hottie and a very young Melvyn Douglas and Raymond Massey were great as always. Of course Charles Laughton was NEVER less than superb and is outstanding here. (I think I may actually like him even better in comedic roles than in dramatic ones. If you haven't seen him in 1954's 'Hobson's Choice,' you should seek it out!) Lilian Bond, another looker, was especially good interacting with both Laughton and Douglas.The stars of the show, though, were the Addams Family-like inhabitants of the manor. Brutish mute butler Morgan, an interesting if not especially challenging role for Boris Karloff, is the first the travelers meet. He, however, is dull in comparison to the members of the Femm family! Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore are absolutely delightful as aging siblings Horace and Rebecca Femm. She is pious, but curt and suspicious and he is charming and hospitable, but mocking and frightened. (It is hard to imagine such opposites living together for years; yet isn't that how it often happens in families?) I just love these two. They add to the dark humor element as well as the eeriness. So many lines keep popping into my mind: 'No beds! No beds!' 'Laughter and sin! Laughter and sin!' 'Have a potato?' Thesiger is a favorite of mine. He was outstanding in so many great films: Karloff's frightened butler in 'The Ghoul,' Dr. Pretorius in 'Bride of Frankenstein' and the undertaker in the Alastair Sim version of 'Scrooge,' to name a few.Even stranger family members await upstairs and one cannot help wondering about some of the back story. Why, for instance, is Horace wanted by the law? Was Saul lying about the others murdering the dead sister? Had Horace always lived at home, or had he fairly recently returned, following whatever brush with the law he may have had? It is interesting to contemplate. Of course, if it were made today and made any money, a sequel and quite possibly a prequel would be forthcoming. Sometimes I think it is just as well to let these questions lie unanswered and left to the imagination.That, of course, is what films of this era did. They left much to the viewers' imagination and the results were frequently much more satisfying. 'The old, Dark house' certainly is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is one I had been searching for for a long while. Ever since I saw a documentary on James Whale's career, this one caught my interest as an interesting and worthwhile venture to undertake in my constant viewings. However, it seems somewhere along the way, I mixed up this with The Cat and the Canary. That is not to say this is a 'bad watch', I just seem to have misplaced and misinterpreted the material I was to be watching, seeing as they are so close in basic overview, but completely different in production. This film deals with a group of wayward souls, including an early appearance from Charles Laughton, taking shelter from the rainy weather in a creepy house butled by Boris 'Freak Show' Karloff. It has plenty of creep-tastic moments, anything with just the sounds of the house and nothing else is fantastic, but the comedy seems to fall really flat, as dated as it is. Overall, for the film historians, give this one a look. But don't expect comedy gold or you'll be sorely disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>James Whale's The Old Dark House provides his Frankenstein star, Boris Karloff, another iconic role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having recently watched two haunted house comedies-Bob Hope's The Cat and the Canary and Abbott &amp; Costello's Hold That Ghost-I finally decided, after about 14 years of keeping it on my tape, to watch James Whale's The Old Dark House since I'm devoting this month to many horror and suspense movies (along with comedies with a little of both). The version I have that I recorded from AMC seemed a bit dark and washed out print-wise. Still, it didn't deter from my enjoyment of seeing such players as Charles Laughton, Raymond Massey, Melvyn Douglas, a young Gloria Stuart, and Boris Karloff in another very compelling role as Morgan the butler after becoming a star in Whale's Frankenstein. There's snappy dialogue, quite a few shocks, and atmospheric chills to keep one alert though the lack of a music score (except during the opening credits) makes one wish this film had come out much later when such things would be properly synchronized. Still, like I said, I was pretty entertained most of the time especially when I saw Massey confront Karloff as it reminded me that they had something in common: They played the same role in different versions of Arsenic and Old Lace-Karloff on Broadway and Massey in Frank Capra's movie version. You know, the one where that character kills a man because "he said I looked like Boris Karloff..."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Director James Whale reigns supreme. This comic horror classic is really special. Atmospheric and a treat to watch. It is storming along the Welsh countryside and the blowing rain with thunder and lightning cause great concern for travelers trapped by a landslide. The tourist need shelter for the night and find themselves at an old haunted looking mansion belonging to the Femm family. Horace(Ernest Thesinger) is the 102 year-old wimpy man of the house taking his orders from his religious fanatic sister Rebecca(Eva Moore). Hard not to notice is the mute butler Morgan(Boris Karloff). All sorts of plots open when the psychotic Morgan accidentally releases the long locked away brother Saul(Brember Wills), who wants to burn down the eerie estate. The eclectic cast also features: Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey, Lillian Bond, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart and Elspeth Dudgeon. They sure don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Old Dark House" is older than dirt, 75 years old, in fact, and one of the cast, Gloria Stuart, is still alive! This 1932 film has all the standard elements: a dark and stormy night, bizarre people stranded in a bizarre house, family secrets, the whole 9 yards. Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart play a married couple who, along with their companion, portrayed by Melvyn Douglas, get lost in a deluge while en route somewhere. They end up in a huge, dark house with some real nut jobs: a simian-looking butler (Boris Karloff), and the Femms, a crazy, inhospitable old lady and her brother who is terrified of her (Eva Moore and Ernest Thesiger). Sister Femm keeps screaming "No beds, no beds." Turns out there is a little more to the family than just these two, as if they weren't enough.James Whale does a terrific job with his use of light, shadows and sounds throughout the movie, but the acting has a very stagey quality in parts. This was when talkies were new; people were just learning the technique of film acting.At first I didn't recognize Melvyn Douglas or Raymond Massey, having never seen either of them this young. I'm actually not sure why I didn't recognize Massey - he basically looked the same. Douglas is wonderful as a charmer who sweeps a chorus girl (Lilian Bond) off her feet. Bond is pretty, vivacious, and does very well with the dialogue until the end, when she goes way over the top. But as far over the top as she goes, she'd have to go some more to beat out Charles Laughton in his film debut. One of the most brilliant actors who ever lived, Laughton hadn't yet learned that less is more on the screen! Gloria Stuart, as Massey's wife, is beautiful and effective. One does have to laugh - coming in out of the pouring rain, she decides to change her clothes...and changes into a sexy Harlow-like evening gown.There is a lot of screaming in "The Old Dark House" though it's never quite as frightening as it's supposed to be. But perhaps back in 1932, it was. It's a great effort at the genre by the talented Whale, and the younger actors all went on to enjoy distinguished careers, even if Gloria Stuart had to wait 65 years to hit it really big. Goes to show you, persistence pays off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Full of grim humour, with a collection of performances as Gothic as the set. Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore are the scene-stealers, with Moore singled out by Whale for especially Expressionist treatment in a bravura scene early on in the film, in which we see her through a kind of camera Cubism.In an outstanding cast, only poor Gloria Stuart, at this early stage of her career, can't quite rise to the occasion. Admittedly she has the dullest part, but Raymond Massey , as her husband, holds his own against the grandest of Grand Guignol from Karloff and Brember Wills, as does, and then some, Melvyn Douglas, who is terrific, his scenes with the excellent Lilian Bond genuinely touching in the midst of the mayhem. Laughton is the icing on this rich, succulent cake.All credit to Whale: it's terrific.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a classic like The Old Dark House, it's all but impossible to come up with something new and unique to say about the film that hasn't already been said a thousand times. I won't even try. Instead, I'll focus on a few of the things that make the film so special to me. First, it's the acting and the characters that bring such life to The Old Dark House and make me want to revisit it time after time. The cast is possibly the finest ensemble gathered for a horror movie in the 30s. Notables such as Charles Laughton, Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, and Gloria Stewart each make the film a joy to watch. Each gives a great performance. But it's Ernest Thesiger that I enjoy the most. His portrayal of the eccentric Horace Femm surpasses, in my mind, his better known role of Dr. Pretorius from Bride of Frankenstein. I realize that this will seem almost blasphemous to some, but it's honestly the way I feel. It's one of the more memorable performances from the early 30s.I'm also a fan of the way James Whale filmed The Old Dark House. A lot of the early talkies feel "stagey" when viewed today. But even though The Old Dark House is in reality "stagey", it never feels like that. Whale does an admirable job of keeping the action flowing given such a small set to work with. Filming from different angles and keeping the exact size of the set hidden in the shadows add to the feeling of more space than is actually there. It's quite an achievement for a film made over 70 years ago.Finally, and this is more of a personal thing, I've always been a fan of the old, dark house mystery genre. In The Old Dark House, the mystery of the nutty Femm family replaces the more standard murder mystery. I consider The Old Dark House the standard barrier for this kind of movie. A spooky old house with mysterious locked rooms, a raging thunderstorm of epic proportions, a group of stranded travelers, and a family of off-the-wall inhabitants are among the films highlights.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This old classic is entertaining, imaginative, atmospheric, and quirky. A fine cast combines with James Whale's talent and creativity to produce an original combination of genres - something that has often been attempted, but rarely so successfully. It's well worth watching over again, because it improves on each viewing as you get used to its unusual approach.The cast is one of the main attractions, with the likes of Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, and Charles Laughton making quite an interesting combination, with each of them used well. Karloff pulled off non-speaking roles as well as anyone, while Douglas and Laughton are also well-matched with their offbeat characters.But it is James Thesiger who is probably the most memorable and entertaining of all, as the timid Horace Femm, host to all of the other characters who meet up accidentally on a forebodingly stormy night. In fact, every performance hits the mark, with Eva Moore doing the hard-of-hearing routine to perfection, Lillian Bond as an engaging chorus girl, Brember Wells as the deranged brother, and all the rest each getting their moments.Whale's distinctive touch with bizarre material combines nicely with the cast, the story, and the dialogue. The timing and the atmosphere are often quite impressive, and indeed many of the lines are hard to explain except in their setting. For example, there's just no way to explain why so many of us find Thesiger's recurring 'have a potato' line so amusing, other than by watching the weird scene as it unfolds, setting up the timing and delivery so well.Given everything else, the story could almost have been incidental, but it has its own numerous interesting developments and turns. The setting, of course, is almost a performer in its own right. To be sure, you might have to be in a certain frame of mind in order fully to appreciate this kind of movie, but it's the kind of movie that you can really enjoy for its originality and weirdness if you come to it without too many expectations or preconceptions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This one's perfect for Halloween. I had a very hard time finding this on the shelves. I had to order it from the company Kino. It took a bite out of my wallet, but I feel it is worth it. If you're brewing a pot of coffee on a stormy night a settling in with a great old horror picture this is a good one. You could even couple it with the Black Cat or Strangler of the Swamp. All fantastic and creepy black and white films from back in the day. Good stuff. If you're a Universal Monster fan like myself you'll really dig Boris Karloff in his roll as a mute, violent, and drunken butler. I would have given this film a 10 if it had a ghost or some sort of supernatural event. Oh well can't have it all! Thanks for reading! I hope I helped!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can't say I was disappointed by The Old Dark House. Directed byhorror movie master James Whale, he knew how to mix a creepygothic tale with some very funny moments. At some points, youknow he's injecting some of his own queer sensibility into it all,making the whole thing oddly kinky.Boris Karlof has a few scenes, and no dialogue, so the rest of thefilm is pretty much carried by... the rest of the cast. A young (andvery beautiful) Gloria Stuart plays Raymond Massey's new, anddisgruntled, wife, who along with a friend, get stuck in a rain stormand have to abandon their open-air touring car and seek shelter in--- you guessed it! And old dark house!And what a house it is! It has been owned by the Femm family forgenerations, and the strange brood still inhabits the place. Horace Femm (Ernest Thesinger) and Rebecka Femm (Eva Moore) are the two most visible fort-holders aside from Morgan(Karloff), and they'll do their best to make sure the meddlesomethreesome who just came a knocking won't meet with the maniacSaul (Brember Wills, in a powerhouse role). And then there'sElspeth 'Sir John' Dudgeon, the literally decaying grandfather of itall, who rules his one brilliant scene from a tall-post bead andintones his/her lines in a high pitched, highly feminine voice.But that's not all. Charles Laughton and his girl Lillian Bond showup on the scene. Turns out they also are stuck in the rain. Soonthere is as much romance in the air as there is cobwebs.Such a great oddity. If you're a classic horror fan, it might notappeal. This one's got a more select audience. Still, I found it tobe a really fun, enjoyable and sometimes kind of scary film. Aclassic. I might use it this year for my Halloween party.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An absolute classic for the 1930's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally watch Zombie movies with gore but I found the time to watch this one night. Indeed the title doesn't lie. It is an old dark house. Those who enjoyed 'The cat and the canary' with Bob Hope should take the time to watch this as it is thoroughly enjoyable throughout. There is a lot of character study and the characters themselves are superbly presented. There's Penderel the lazy but dashing fish-out-of-water hero played entertainingly by Melvyn Douglas. Also Sir William Porterhouse played by Charles Laughton and the eccentric Femms played creepily by Ernest Thesiger and Eva Moore. James Whale's direction with ice cold water pouring down necks and bad weather make it look real and the house itself is very cosy. Atmosphere is a strong point and story is another. Good wordplay like 'I heard a voice coming from behind that locked door' and 'He's gone to let Saul out. Wait for him downstairs, and kill him.' It still sends a chill down the spine. As with a good horror movie there is always an exciting climax. This one features a fight between Melvyn Douglas and Brember Wills who go crashing over the stair bannister. Raymond Massey fighting Boris Karloff is great too. For the time I assume that Boris Karloff trying to rape Gloria Stuart was quite nasty and savage but today it looks tame. You will be thoroughly satisfied by this movie by the end and probably want to watch it again. For one of the best 1930's horrors I give this 9 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Classic Horror Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's so very much that works so well in this film directed by James Whale that the only valid criticisms I can think to make about it are that Boris Karloff is much too great a talent for the role given to him and the romance between Ms. Perkins and Roger Penderal is much too rushed. Aside from that however, this is without a doubt on of the finest Horror comedies ever produced.The cinematography(done by Arthur Edeson) is superb with outstanding use of light, shadows and very wise close-ups and mirror tricks. The sound FX are excellent too as the storm is one of the loudest and most foreboding I've ever seen in a classic Horror film. The actors/actresses use of body language adds so much to their characters and James Whale shows a keen sense of direction by keeping everything in motion. And the film is often quite funny and amusing too which is of course a wonderful plus.Although the film is filmed with talented stars such as Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart, in my opinion Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore and Brember Willis steal this movie from its main stars with their wonderful, wacky and weird family.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gloria Stuart in The Old Dark House (1932)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One interesting note of this film is that Gloria Stuart [who you may recall from Titanic (1997) or Secrets Of The Blue Room (1933), The Invisible Man (1933), My Favorite Year (1982), Murder, She Wrote: The Last Free Man (2001) TV] plays "Margaret Waverton". For being a 1932 film, it sure is creepy and the plot is quite eerie, but simple to follow. It might remind you of a bad dream you have had. You might not recognize Boris Karloff at first as "Morgan" who played The Monster "Frankenstein" the year before. As of this review written February 14, 2002, Gloria Stuart is, of course, the only living (and may I politely say) and surviving cast member of this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid cast and a master director of the era combine to deliver a comedy chiller with genuine atmosphere. The house and the storm in which it is engulfed actually appear to be real.Although the film retains a horror backdrop the performances delivered ensure that the tongue is kept in cheek throughout. The effect of firelight and shadows (naturely the house has no electricity) add to the eerie feeling that somehow you can only get in a 1930s movie.Boris Karloff is great fun as the freaky butler who is best avoided once he starts on the bottle and Charles Laughton hams it up as only he could. And it's interesting to see Titanic's Gloria Stuart in an early role.And in the great tradition of such movies the light of day is very much a welcome sight.</fullReview>

Ernest Thesiger &amp; Eva Moore are beyond praise as hosts you would NOT want to spend the night with.

		<shortDescription>James Whale classic drenched in atmosphere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The offbeat humor so associated with James Whale is on display throughout this movie, mixed with moments of straightforward drama. I read the original James B. Priestley novel years ago, and found the film to be a very faithful re-creation of the book. Ernest Thesiger gives what is possibly an even funnier performance as the fearful Horace Femm ,than his outrageous Dr. Praetorius in Bride of Frankenstein. He even has a line which is paraphrased in BOF, as he offers a glass of gin to his uninvited guests. The humorous tone is set from the beginning, with bickering husband and wife Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart arguing in an open touring car, with the rain pouring in, as a sleepy Melvyn Douglas snoozes in the back seat, waking up to sing the opening verses of a song that seems to be a version of 'Singin' in the Rain'. The Gothic elements of the story are well established, one by one, from the ominous butler opening the door, (Karloff) to the obnoxious, religious fanatic sister Rebecca Femm, whose main preoccupation ,aside from the wrath of God ,seems to be reminding the guests that they can't have beds. (Eva Moore). The sets representing the interiors of the old farmhouse, with its high ceilings and large fireplace, the long banqueting table at which the guests sit down to a sparse meal, the barn with its haystacks and clucking chickens, are all quite convincing. The dinner scene itself is legendary for the moment when Horace Femm offers each guest in turn a single potato, and Melvyn Douglas politely declines the pickled onions offered by the menacing butler, and graciously hands a cruet to his grumpy hostess with a smiling, "Vinegar, Miss Femm?" The movie ranges from comedy verging on spoof, to tense drama and even a touching romance between bachelor Douglas and the sweet chorus girl mistress (Lillian Bond) of jovial millionaire Charles Laughton, two more unexpected guests. This film is a treat that should be seen by Whale fans and devotees of Thirties horror flicks. It is simply a unique little gem and not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS! HAVE A SPOILER!*** First of all, your enjoyment of this will be enhanced if you see GODS AND MONSTERS first, the biopic about James Whale, who directed this among others (which include FRANKENSTEIN, THE BRIDE OF FRANKENSTEIN, THE INVISIBLE MAN and the Depression-era version of SHOWBOAT.) Or, read Christopher Bram's novel, FATHER OF FRANKENSTEIN, on which GODS AND MONSTERS is based. This will prepare you for one of most coded movies ever made. There is dialogue about the biblical Saul's love for David, there's a patriarch played by an actress with a beard glued to her face, there's a man who is MORE than happy to allow his female soul mate to fall in love with another man and there is a puritanical old lady whose hand can't help landing on the bosom of the lass she's chastising. But, far from being silly, THE OLD DARK HOUSE works on several levels. It is campy only inasmuch as the characters allow themselves to be campy. Each one of the characters, visitors or visited, has an inner life. Life in the old, dark house may seem horrible to the visitors, but, after all, they have broken the routine to which the inhabitants are accustomed. This is not so much a horror movie as a comparison of normal and abnormal. The Kino DVD has two commentary tracks. Both are well worth hearing, but the one by Gloria Stuart is especially delightful. She was in the movie and remembers it fondly. Viewers will remember her fondly from the James Cameron TITANIC, for which, at the age of 86, she was nominated for an Academy Award. Her comments are lively and full of humor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best gothic comedies ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A witty gothic comedy set in rural England has deliciously wicked characters and a very funny script. Whale's direction is also notable -- I liked how he used the camera pulling back to show how jarring Stuart's character was in the setting. Some attempt is also made to make Douglas' character more interesting than your average horror "leading man" (those who know something of Whale's life will see more than a little bit of him in the cynical man of the world). Karloff just skulks around, but Thesiger is at his best as the effeminate head of the family (his name is even "Femm"). Laughton is also at his best here, at first showing himself as an arrogant a*s, but eventually coming across as a somewhat sorrowful gentleman with an overdose of misplaced pride. Lilian Bond shows herself poorly, only speaking in isolated one-shots (always a sign that the performance came off poorly and had to be fixed in post-production). An exceptional film that manages to spoof its genre and be a great example of it at the same time, like Whale's other masterpiece "The Bride of Frankenstein."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good fun with James Whale sending up horror conventions as two mincing old queens and a fag hag stumble across the dark house of the title. Which is, indeed, old.A servant who can't manage coherent speech (a wasted Boris Karloff) answers the door. After greeting the strangers with a series of unrelated vowels, Melvyn Douglas ? the one who's like a camp version of Julian Clary ? quips, "Even Welsh ought not to sound like that."Pretty soon they're taken in out of the rain and introduced to the owner's brother, played by Ernest Thesiger. We also meet the owner, his sister, a nightmarish, screaming abhorrence who possibly influenced the team behind "The League of Gentlemen". Speaking of comedy troupes, the whole production feels like the reform gig of old friends, as a sizeable section of the cast would work together again in Bride of Frankenstein.Charles Laughton enters the scene after the first twenty minutes, a comedy Lancastrian who seems as if he's just walked in from a completely different film. This is a welcome intrusion, however, as Laughton's acting ? I would call it over the top but it's not that subtle ? is absolutely hilarious. This is a man who's determined to steal the film, and doesn't care who gets in his way.The dialogue is deliciously crafted, with Thesiger in particular relishing his lines, while the direction is well thought, if not quite excelling. The whole picture plays out like some bizarre, unrelenting drawer room farce, sort of like Harold Pinter on crack. Romantic subplots, sketches of insanity, religious fervour and staggering comic setpieces. Oddly, the only thing this horror movie doesn't have is a single scary moment. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dated but still moderately entertaining and reasonably intriguing horror film, it is helped a young Melvyn Douglas in an amusing role and some funny moments involving Ernest Thesiger, who suits his character perfectly. The film is, however, uncomfortably frantic, a bit patchy, and having the actors scream over the loud sound effects is not very effective. But the good lighting and art direction keep the film engaging on a visual level, plus there is some clever image distortion work and the sound effects are rather good for the time. There is never really a solid plot or storyline, but having colourful characters provides some compensation. The film is regarded as a classic of the horror genre today, and it is quite interesting to watch. It may not be flawless, but there's enough in it to provide adequate amusement.</fullReview>

The location is a rambling mansion with plenty of dark nooks and crannies, and a flight of primitive steps at the front door that the actors had some difficulty negotiating. As usual, characters split up and wander off in defiance of common sense, and their piercing screams fail to reach the ears of their fellow travellers, in defiance of the laws of physics.The performances are uneven, but the stand outs are the three ladies who present very different characters ? oh, and there's a fourth lady, unaccountably in drag. The director was having fun. Of the men, one character is poorly written, so there's not much the actor could do ? but otherwise the performances are entertaining, although the cackling laughter can't make up for the underwhelming nature of the reveal. A daft story, not to be taken seriously, and the plot jumps about as we move from one part of the house to the other, ending in a sappy climax.Overall, not really a horror ? more an entertaining oddity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather Boring With An Absurd, Forced Romance Angle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House is a relatively boring old horror with a rather absurd romance angle. For a while, it was considered a lost film. It disappeared after being pulled from syndication when Castle re-made it in 1963. But was later re-discovered and re-released. It's also notable for being Karloff's first credited leading role (although he was in Frankenstein prior to this, he was not listed in the credits).The story basically revolves around a group of vacationing friends who get trapped amid a landslide and flood, which forces them to stop at an old house, inhabited by a secretive family with a dark past, to ask for help.Said inhabitants are an odd bunch to say the least....they aren't very hospitable, offer warnings...and seem to be hiding something sinister.Next a showgirl and her sugar daddy show up at the door in a similar predicament (as to provide an oppourtunity to tie in a romance angle, and a little comic relief).The remainder of the film has Karloff wooing the young gold digger; trying to discover what this family is trying to keep locked away and hidden; and of course....attempting to escape with their lives.But the whole thing just plods along without really engaging you much....and the way the whole romance angle (which culminates with a f*cking marriage proposal....after knowing each other for half a night haha) plays out is just ridiculous. Then it's over.Not sure it deserves the high rating it has on IMDb (7.3), considering what it is. Seems pretty basic, mild, and, well....boring, to me. Not to mention the whole romance angle seeming to be forced and out of place.4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seen as originally intended, this packs a Whale of a wallop</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's fun reading the reviews of this gem from James Whale at IMDb. Clearly almost all are based on the truncated version which was the ONLY print in commercial release for many decades. The original running time was closer to 90 minutes--when the master print was trimmed by nearly a third, the result was significant and the element of menace changed considerably. I loved it in it's briefer version of approximately 65 minutes but in its entirety, this truly is a very frightening movie: an awful lot happens in the additional 25 minutes and if big brother Saul Femm doesn't freak you out the same way he does his siblings Rebecca and Horace, then you are made of sterner stuff than me and these Femms. And once again, a well-meaning Boris winds up as merely misunderstood, and someone we don't loathe or fear quite so much by the time the credits roll. A Good Cast Is Worth Repeating, and so is this movie in one sitting in order to catch everything the director has intended for the viewer. An unequivocal classic that many have yet to fully enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've just finished watching the DVD 3 times (so I could both audio commentaries), and I've only now noticed what seems to be a glaring continuity error. (Or, more likely, Whale intended it this way.) It comes up when the drapes catch fire near the end of the movie. Go back and check to see who puts out the fire. Answer: Nobody. Whale focuses the audience's attention on whether Melvyn Douglas is OK, and on Karloff's final scene, and totally ignores the fact that the fire upstairs is threatening to burn the house down! Everyone ignores the flames and the fire, apparently, just puts itself out. Still overall an excellent film, with standout performances by Ernest Thesiger and Charles Laughton.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Five waylaid travellers on a stormy night seek refuge in an old dark house, only to meet the demented Femm family and their equally dangerous butler.This is an absolute cracker of a picture - terrifying and hilarious in equal parts - thanks to Whale's tremendous styling, a wonderful cast and a brilliant script by Benn Levy. The Femms are just so gloriously nutty; the nervous and effeminate Horace, the crotchety, deaf, puritanical spinster Rebecca ("More vinegar Miss Femm ?", someone asks, as if she needed any), the keep-him-locked-up pyromaniac Saul, the dotty hundred-year-old patriarch Sir Roderick, and the grim, drunken, mute, misogynistic butler Morgan. Ah, what a happy household. The cast are all superb, but Thesiger, Karloff and Laughton are especially brilliant. Thesiger's pallid makeup makes his skull seem to glow out of his face with tremendously unsettling effect, Karloff epitomises the scary butler (his first appearance behind a door is incredible) and Laughton's lovably bluff working-class-lad-turned-millowner gives the movie a crucial dose of warmth. Made by the same team responsible for the classic 1931 version of Frankenstein, it's hard to think of a horror film with more style and wit, and its influence on the genre is considerable (I always think The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is a weird kind of remake). Trivia note - actress Dudgeon, who plays a male role (Sir Roderick) is credited as John Dudgeon. Based on the novel Benighted by J.B. Priestley. Have a potato !!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented this film and watched it after hearing and reading a number of reviews, including Leondard Maltin's book and after hearing that Gloria Stuart was in it (knowing she had an early movie career but I only knew her from Titanic.) I found it surprising that it was on DVD, seeing how old it is and (I thought) obscure. I must say, I did enjoy the film and was surprised at just how effective it is considering how old it is and what a low budget it must have been shot on. The water scenes are quite realistic and it looks quite like a real storm. Photography-wise, the film looks even older than Frankenstein or King Kong, movies that were close in age to this one.It's probably best this film is in black and white as it adds to the dreadful atmosphere. It still would have worked OK in color although they weren't really doing that then were they? I do say the most effective sound effect was the constant whine of the wind outside. There is something unique about it, at once recognizable as a sound effect but also with a certain pitch that's very eerie. It never lets up and I'm sure the makers of this movie intended it. The cast are all wonderful, adding as noted, some humor while it still becomes menacing anyway in the house.</fullReview>

Old Dark House makes great late night viewing; so if you're a fan of classic horror, don't miss this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Did anyone else think it odd that Sir Roderick Femm was played by a woman? Or that a rooster kept crowing in the middle of the night? From the madman in the locked room to the raging storm, it's just possible that Whale was having fun with all the horror cliches before moving on to films like "Show Boat". Not having read Priestley's novel, I can't tell if he did the same thing. I thought this was a scream.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite incredible cast and director...not much</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From J.B. Priestley's book about a small group of people on a mountain drive who become stranded by a storm and take refuge in an eerie mansion inhabited by a very peculiar family. Predictably creaky thriller from 1932, although not quite as dated as one might suspect; the cast (including Boris Karloff, Charles Laughton, Gloria Stuart, Raymond Massey, and Melvyn Douglas--all looking so young!) certainly makes it interesting, and there are several welcomed bits of tongue-in-cheek humor. Maybe worthwhile if you come across a print that isn't ravaged by time. Directed by the now-legendary James Whale, a drawing card all on its own. Later remade in 1963. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A small rewriting below(after 2nd viewing)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale is the greatest horror director ever with movies like Frankenstein (!), the Invisible Man (!!) and the Bride of Frankenstein (!!!), the best horror film ever. Boris Karloff is the best horror actor ever..... Why was this movie made, it is not scary at all and the acting is rather amateurish(Ernest Thesiger) and the dialogs are pretty silly ("have a potato", after which Horace Femm throws the potato on the plate of Roger Penderel!?Maybe I am a fool and is this a great movie with great acting, but I saw this movie with my brother and father and we all agreed that it was a waste of our time. Halliwell's Film Guide gave the movie four stars which indicates, and I quote, a film outstanding in many ways, a milestone in cinema history.Am I crazy or are those smart film-critics crazy ?Perhaps I should see the film once again and I might appreciate it more, but I doubt it. I gave the movie a 5 because I couldn't give a movie with both Karloff and Whale involved a lower grade.P.S.: Boris Karloff will live on forever as the great master of horror, even after this Questionable piece of work ! ;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;; Seeing it for the second I have to change my opinion on this film.I was wrong in mowing it down.It is actually a great film with superb acting and wonderful dialog. This just shows how important a second viewing can be!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Any Port In a Storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>James Whale directed this adaptation of a J.B. Priestly novel with a campier touch than usual. A slight story of a group of travelers whom a violent rainstorm has caused to take refuge in what is by far the dankest and most forbidding Welsh country home ever shown on film, where they encounter a family of extreme eccentrics, one of whom is a religious fanatic, another a craven trickster. A pyromaniac brother and a centenarian patriarch (actually played by a woman), are also on hand. The travelers are a motley, chatty bunch with problems of their own. Did I mention Boris Karloff? He plays the drunken butler. A frightful sight. Some have hailed this trifle as a masterpeice of black humor, a send-up of horror films, a sly commentary on sexual mores, and possibly an attack on organized religion. There may be other qualities attributed to the film as well. I wouldn't be surprised. For my part, I find it a little dull. Benn Levy's dialogue is arch without being brilliant; and I hate that. The actors on the other hand are quite good, but they can't save the movie from claustrophobia. What's missing is intrigue, emotional involvement, clever plotting, and above all inspiration. Whale on other occasions had proved himself capable of inspiration, even vision, in a manner of speaking. He seems disinterested here, content to move his characters around like chess pieces in a Lewis Carroll story, but the picture runs out of steam quickly. It has its virtues, though, in the radiant beauty of Gloria Stuart, the crude energy of Charles Laughton, Raymond Massey's grim authority and above all, Ernest Thesiger's prissy, hysterical line readings, and Whale's loving close-ups of his face of an emaciated gargoyle.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on a JB Priestley novel, and it shows. We are in the territory of the country house, the benighted travellers and the Dark Secret. If the storyline is weak and the acting hammy, James Whale directs with aplomb and the gothic effects of lighting and weather are impressive.On a stormy night, Philip and Margaret Waverton (Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart) are motoring through remote Welsh countryside with their friend Penderel (Melvyn Douglas). Landslides block the road before and behind, and the three cold, wet travellers are forced to seek refuge at the dark house on the hill.The house is occupied by a centenarian invalid, his three disturbed offspring and their wild butler, Morgan, played by Boris Karloff. The group is joined by two other stranded travellers, Sir William Porterhouse (Charles Laughton) and Gladys (Lillian Bond)."This house gives me the creeps," opines Margaret, and the tension builds as mirror distortions, howling winds and strange noises from behind locked doors lead inexorably to the appearance of Saul Femm, the family's Dark Secret.Margaret Waverton is the sex interest. She undresses because her things are wet, and puts on a figure-hugging gown. She and Gladys squeal and seek the protection of the men, and occasionally flash their cleavages. Morgan, the dumb giant, takes a lustful interest in Margaret, and the faun-and-satyr scenes are well done.Charles Laughton is great as 'Bill' Porterhouse, the self-made Lancashire tycoon. A stock target of Priestley's, this rapacious capitalist is the butt of some impassioned sermonising, put here into the mouth of Penderel. Porterhouse is 'weekending' with Gladys, the chorus girl, another of priestley's two-dimensional characters - the Fallen Woman. Gladys is not beyond salvation, however, and she and Penderel fall madly in love.Penderel has dated horribly. This type of hero - the moustachio'd, tweedbound war hero with the flippant, cheerful manner - seems ludicrous to a modern viewer. Perhaps the greatest criticism of Penderel is that his jokes are relentlessly unfunny. Melvyn Douglas is a sort of British bargain-basement Clark Gable, without the sex appeal.Raymond Massey is workmanlike as the bland 'nice guy' Philip. Ernest Thesiger gives his character, Horace Femm, a quirky appeal, but Eva Moore as Rebecca is too strident and unsubtle. Lillian Bond plays Gladys with a breezy charm and a natural insouciance. Brember Wills is unnerving as the unpredictable Saul.Karloff's first appearance is dramatic, and he sustains the menace of Morgan very effectively throughout the film. The chiaroscuro lighting effects are excellent, for example when Horace and Philip are alone on the staircase. Margaret's shadowplay is cleverly done, especially its powerful climax.Predictably for a creaking old British thriller, the film has some glaring flaws. Penderel and Gladys disappear to the barn for what must be several hours, but no-one seems to notice, not even Bill, Gladys's companion. When Morgan attacks Margaret in the main room, not one of the eight other people in the house is on hand to help the poor woman. The dialogue by means of which Penderel and Gladys declare their love is execrable sub-Noel Coward stuff. Why doesn't Saul finish off Penderel when he has him at his mercy on the hearth? And where does Horace disappear to when the action is going on? How come everyone is so matter-of-fact the following morning? And why are the travellers leaving, when the road is still blocked by the landslides?Verdict - a fairly feeble apparatus, enlivened by some good performances and Whale's directorial professionalism.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Old Dark House, The (1932) *** (out of 4) Extremely bizarre black comedy from James Whale about an assorted group of people who gather in a creepy house, which contains some even creepier owners. Many horror fans consider this a great film but I'm not one of them, although it is one of the most frustrating films I've ever seen. On one viewing I might really enjoy this film while on the next viewing it might bore the hell out of me. I'm not sure what it is about this film but I've never totally warmed up to it, although there are many things I love about it. The cast includes Boris Karloff, Melvyn Douglas, Gloria Stuart, Charles Laughton, Lilian Bond, Ernest Thesiger and Raymond Massey. All of these folks give good performances even though some are all over the place. Karloff comes off the least interesting in a thankless role as the creepy butler. I also love certain scenes including the dinner scene and another moment where Stuart is making hand shadows on the wall. However, as I said earlier, there are times that this film really bores me and I find it rather uneven. The old dark house genre never really had anything great going for it and that includes this interesting work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's old and it's dark and it's a house</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when the idea of a group of people knocking on the door of a creepy old mansion when they can't travel any further was relatively new, but don't let that fool you into thinking that something interesting happens in this movie, because nothing does. The non-story is stretched out to support seventy minutes of melodramatic muttering and shrieking, several grating performances and James Whale's patented ugly close-ups.While trying to navigate their car along a slippery mountain road, husband and wife Raymond Massey and Gloria Stuart, plus suave passenger Melvyn Douglas, narrowly escape a landslide and pull into the driveway of a spooky old house to seek shelter. Just as they're introduced to the oddball family of Ernest Thesiger, two more travellers turn up ? Charles Laughton and Lillian Bond. Something strange is afoot in the old castle and our heroes are in for a sleepless night...Unlike the audience for this movie, who will probably nod off unless they're fans of stilted horrors that mistake camp for atmosphere. Laughton, normally a very watchable actor, foghorns his way through a one-note role while Boris Karloff is utterly wasted in a non-speaking part as a shambling butler. (What is it with Whale and Karloff? Did they agree to make films together on the condition that Karloff's potential go as unfulfilled as possible?) The only sparks come thanks to the chemistry between Douglas and Bond, who fall in love in a ridiculously short space of time but are at least entertaining as a couple.The dialogue consists largely of pushy hints between Thesiger and his religious nutter sister Eva Moore as to what their dark secret is. When the lights go out and Thesiger has to get a lamp, Moore tells him: 'It's too big for me... if you don't know where it is, I'll tell you... though you know as well as I do ? it's on the top landing on the little table. Do you know where the top landing is, Horace? At least you might believe there is a top landing, although you do believe in so little. It's up there Horace, up there! Next to the roof!' All right, shut up! Gee, do you think there's something going on up on the top landing, folks? All we need is for the Mystery Mobile to be the next car to pull up outside and the film's credibility will be complete.As for style, the director of photography must have been limited to a box of matches, so murky and gloomy is the lighting. Not creepy, or oppressive, or moody, but just not very bright, which isn't exactly the same thing. Rather than incidental music, someone turns the volume up on the wind machine every time something 'scary' happens, which is quite innovative but sure sounds dull after a while. I dunno... there's a secret in the house and the group discovers what it is... erm, and that's it. I guess I'm just not a James Whale fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been watching a lot of films on telly recently, and this was one that I caught on the American Classic Movies channel. I enjoyed it so much that I came online to read more about it. I still find it hard to believe that Mrs. Waverton was played by Gloria Stuart! Oh my! borrowing from her character from Titanic(1997), "Yes m'am, you truly were a dish in your heyday!" wow! she was incredibly stunning. Anyhow, back to the film, which is about a group of travelers who find themselves forced to lodge in an old dark house in an isolated Welsh village, seeking shelter from horrid torrential rain. They are mostly youngsters, therefore in their glee, they fail to notice the awkwardness and eeriness of their hosts as they are being received into this home. Slowly, after the house has been locked up for the night, new characters within the home begin to be revealed, some of them sinister and others just eccentric and surely the guests begin to realise that their lives are in danger. My favourite character was Sir William Porterhouse, he was a complete riot and a joy to watch. I recommend this film for everyone. May all their souls rest in perfect peace, I was reading up on the biographies of the actors, and as of the time I wrote this review, they are all deceased except for Gloria Stuart, whom if she lives up until 2010, will be 100 years old.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Certainly a more fitting title for this movie. Not very scary but never boring, and strangely photographed. All of the characters, including the travelers who end up at the old dark house, seem to be stark, raving mad. Maybe director James Whale was warming up for his next collaboration with Boris Karloff, a little horror movie called Frankenstein. Karloff is a buffoon in this movie, when he is meant to be menacing. Add Charles Laughton, chewing on scenery (as he always does), a young Gloria Stewart, decades before she dropped the Heart of the Ocean into the sea, and you get a movie that will probably appeal more to movie buffs (especially those who like German expressionist cinema) than to horror buffs or the general population.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lot to like but a lot of sloppy problems as well</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie looks really great. The studio did a fantastic job of creating a really eerie mood--with a great tomb-like home and decent storm effects throughout the film. So the mood was certainly right for the film. However, despite being a very creepy film, poor acting and occasionally stupid moments in the plot make this only a passable thriller.As far as acting goes, the worst job was done by Charles Laughton. He was supposed to play a common working stiff who made good. But someone needed to tell him that to seem common you do not need to speak your lines at twice the normal volume. This is one of his earliest films and you can see he has a bit to learn. Also, inexplicably, at times Melvin Douglas' voice keeps cracking like he's in the throes of puberty. I really can't understand why.Now all the acting wasn't so poor. Ernest Thesiger carried the movie with his creepy and appropriate acting--he gives you the willies all by himself. And the rest of the cast was fine as well.Plot-wise, the movie just didn't make sense. Okay, you've got a homicidal arsonist locked in an upstairs room. So, you apparently hire a guy to watch him who is prone to getting drunk and trying to kill people himself?! Huh? And, the next day after these two maniacs ran about the home trying to kill everyone, you bid everyone goodbye with a smile on your face??!! Also, for some odd reason, some idiot thought that having Melvin Douglas instantly fall in love with Laughton's lady friend made sense. Well, this occurs so quickly and inexplicably that it doesn't.So how, despite these problems, does the film STILL merit a 6? Well, most of it is due to the general creepiness of the film. Despite plot holes and occasional over-acting, the film is just plain scary and creepy throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The forerunner of all the "old dark house" comedy/mysteries...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every cliché known to horror films and a generous amount of humor can be found in James Whales' THE OLD DARK HOUSE--with a cast that includes GLORIA STUART, BORIS KARLOFF, MELVYN DOUGLAS, RAYMOND MASSEY, LILLIAN BOND and scene-stealer ERNEST THESIGER as the host who gives a strange welcome to travelers seeking shelter from a storm.The storm effects last throughout the movie with lots of thunder and lightning and too much of the film takes place amid very dark shadows, lit supposedly by candelight. A bad print of the film can make this one a bit of a trial to sit through, but there's a lot of entertainment to be had if you're patient enough.Karloff wears strange Simian make-up and, strangely enough, is not the outstanding thespian this time. That honor goes to ERNEST THESIGER who is absolutely brilliant in a dominant role.MELVYN DOUGLAS and RAYMOND MASSEY are almost unrecognizable (they're so young here) but CHARLES LAUGHTON had clearly not shed any of his theatrical flair for films. He gives the film's most artificial performance.By today's standards, all of the acting is too theatrical to be real and some of it is way over-the-top. But that's James Whale for you. Not exactly a director who believed in subtle touches. You won't find any of that quality here.For "old dark house" addicts, this one has almost everything--except subtlety.</fullReview>

I found it boring, creaky, stodgy, monotonous, poorly lit, and about as animated as a river of molasses. Considering the caliber of the cast (and the director), the acting isn't particularly noteworthy (Gloria Stuart is absolutely ravishing, though, which breaks up the monotony). If it's supposed to be a comedy, as some have claimed, it fails on that count. If it's supposed to be a horror film, as others have claimed, it fails on that count. If it's supposed to be a comedy horror film, it fails on both counts. I actually haven't seen it in a while, so maybe another viewing of it will change my opinion. But I remember how difficult it was to sit through the first time, so I doubt I'll put myself through that again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, dreary "horror" film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of annoying characters are stuck in an old, dark house in the middle on nowhere during a violent storm. The brother and sister (Ernest Thesiger, Eva Moore) who run the horse are strange and the mute butler (Boris Karloff) is scarred and violent. And where is that creepy laughter coming from? This film is considered a classic but I can't see why. I've seen it multiple times trying to figure out WHY people like this film and I'm at a loss. It has a great director (James Whale), a very good cast and an eerie setting but it falls flat. Mainly almost all the characters are annoying. You have some wonderful actors here giving their worst performances--Melvyn Douglas, Charles Laughton and Raymond Massey are the worst offenders. Moore and Thesiger are (I think) supposed to be amusing but their lines fall flat. Thesiger's looks give new meaning to the word "overacting"--also his constant recitation of "Have a potato" isn't even remotely funny. Moore is just loud and obnoxious. The only two that are good are Karloff (who's downright terrifying at times) and Gloria Stuart (young and beautiful).The script is full of attempts at humor that fall flat at every turn. The horror content is, at best, pretty weak. Only Karloff manages to scare and he can't carry the entire movie. I was basically bored and this seemed MUCH longer than it is (about 70 minutes or so). I think some people assume that since it's old, was lost for quite a few years and has a top director and cast it must automatically be great. Sadly it's not.Also the only print I've seen is in terrible shape--the sound is muddy and the picture is (at times) too dark to make out anything. I'm not holding the film itself responsible for that but it might have affected my judgment (but I don't think so). A 1.</fullReview>

Mind you, I think Whale's two Frankenstein films and his Invisible Man are masterworks and that his Show Boat is well done, although dreadfully photographed, edited and sound recorded. Old Dark House had neither the wit, the inventiveness nor the creepiness of his other horror films and the love story was dreadfully done. So I'm a dissenter and maybe the only one.
