		<shortDescription>The Old Dark House ready for return to television?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Old Dark House does not provide the gore and R-rated material seen in today's horror movies but it does reflect a more simple time when comedy and horror could be matched while maintaining a family rating.As a child I saw The Old Dark House over one hundred times, I remember being on the edge of my chair during the entire movie every single sitting.If only the local television stations would be able to air this movie, a new generation of viewers could enjoy, The Old Dark House. The film may be the last of the "old age" comedies that were popular during that time. Tom Poston does a good job of not only showing fear but does so in comedy style to allow us, the viewers, to use our imagination. While The Old Dark House may not live up to today's standards, it was a "movie of the day" in 1963.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Owing little to either James Whale's 1932 chiller, or to J.B. Priestly's original source novel, "Benighted", THE OLD DARK HOUSE is a small, off-beat and pleasantly daffy scare-comedy, a change-of-pace for director William Castle. Filmed and set in England, Tom Poston stars as a hapless American who, on a visit to a curious roommate's even curiouser family home, is caught up in a murderous merry-go-round of mayhem, nursery rhymes, love and (very possibly) the end of the world (including an Ark!). British stalwarts Robert Morley, Joyce Grenfell, Mervyn Johns, and Peter Bull have a charming good time playing the various members of the Femm family, along with Janette Scott and an unforgettably slinky Fenella Fielding as romantic interests. None of the usual Castle gimmicks for this release--just a bit of eccentricity and a pleasant, creepy, multi-murder mystery, with a puzzle to solve, a couple of surprises, and some good solid chuckles.A note to fans of Charles Addams--the film's poster and its main titles contain some choice Addams artwork.An additional note: the film was shot in color, but released in a very faintly tinted black-and-white version. The color version of the film was only seen on subsequent television release.This movie really does deserve a DVD release, not only for its place in the William Castle canon, but for the performances and the fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing and entertaining camp horror-thriller!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this creepy horror-comedy directed by William Castle we meet Tom Penderel (Tom Poston), an American residing in England from where he sells cars. During a visit to a casino, where he informs his eccentric flatmate Caspar Femm (Peter Bull) that Tom has now acquired for Caspar a brand new American car, Tom is invited to Femm House, home of Caspar and his family. Reluctantly he accepts the invitation and makes his way to Femm House, only to find murder and very creepy family.The rating on IMDb for 'The Old Dark House' (1963) simply is not an accurate assessment of this films quality in my opinion. Though quite obviously camp and with a unique charm all of its own this movie delivers an entertaining storyline and amusing comic scenes from beginning to end. Upon encountering the oddball charm of Caspar it becomes apparent that this horror movie is not going to be an all out scarefest, in fact its quality lies in the intermingling of a tight `whodunit' thriller with so many humorous sequences.Tom Poston is cast perfectly as the nervous American trying desperately to make sense of the madness going on around him and his continuing encounters with overprotective and psychotic father Morgan Femm (Danny Green) make for some of the best comedy I have seen in a horror movie for a long time. The whole Femm family have a distinctly creepy charm to them from the gun-nut Uncle Roderick (an inspired performance from Robert Morley) to the charmingly deranged Petiphar (Mervyn Johns). Also worth noting is the performance from Janette Scott (The Day of the Triffiads) as the sweet and innocent Cecily Femm.'The Old Dark House' is a wonderfully accomplished camp, horror-thriller in my opinion. The storyline is entertaining throughout and the comedy does not seem forced but instead works as a light-hearted diversion from what was actually an interesting and slightly complex plot. All this is complimented by a beautifully arranged and often apt musical score. While not really delivering any scares 'The Old Dark House' delivers entertainment and is certainly worth watching in my opinion. Despite some rather suspect special effects (though considering the year it was made one can hardly hold poor effects against it) and camp quality I recommend this to horror fans. My rating for 'The Old Dark House' (1963) - 7.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hadn't expected the rigmarole I'd have to go through to snag this film on video, several years ago. I'd seen this two or three times as a child and reveled in the dark comedy of it. The plot is silly, but it's not nearly as important as the production itself.The charming performances by the many delightful character actors are the highlights of "The Old Dark House" -- Robert Morely, Joyce Grenfell, Peter Bull. Who would ever think that Tom Poston would appear as the romantic (?!) hero of a movie, but there he is. And Oo, that Fenella Fielding! What a dish! This film isn't for everyone, but I'll never forget it, and neither will you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can William Castle Make a Bad Film? Seems Not.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Penderel (Tom Poston) is invited to stay at the Femm household... which seems all fine and good until a big storm comes and it is revealed that the family has its share of eccentricities. Not the least of which is the idea that it's time to build an ark.Director and producer William Castle seems to do no wrong. He has taken an old story, one that was previously made into a dark film in the 1930s, and added his own brand of humor and madness. And who better than Tom Poston to be the star? His slapstick comedy blends in perfectly as he interacts with the amorous Morgana and makes good use of trap doors.If you're looking for a horror film, this really is not the film for you. There's nothing scary about it. But it is a fine film from a horror master, and there is the threat of death. For, you see, an inheritance is on the line and it would be to each family member's advantage if the others were not to survive.Please pick up the William Castle box set from Sony and Columbia Pictures. There is not a bad film in the box.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humpty Dumpty had a great fall?.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One would expect a collaboration between the American director William Castle and the British production studios Hammer to result in a terrific must-see film, considering they were both horror genre giants in their respective continents during the early sixties. Castle became world famous and appreciated thanks to his morbidly themed but nevertheless light-headed Gothic horror spectacles ("House on Haunted Hill", "Mr. Sardonicus", "13 Ghosts"?), and on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean, Hammer studios boomed with the gruesome re-imaging of the legendary Universal classics from the thirties ("Dracula", "The Mummy", "Frankenstein"?). Knowing this, "The Old Dark House" seems to be the ideal marriage, since it's more or less a remake of the underrated 1932 Universal masterpiece and a great opportunity for a director like Castle to showcase his creativity. Strangely enough, however, the film is somewhat of a disappointment and it's only rescued from inglorious mediocrity thanks to a handful of nice gags and an entertaining final act; including a surprising plot-twist and an exciting race against the clock ? literally! The rest of the film clumsily bounces back and forth between talkative mystery and immature comedy. Please don't get me wrong, "The Old Dark House" is never boring and I still prefer it over most of the soulless horror junk being released nowadays, but I simply expected a little bit more? American car salesman Tom Penderel drives out to the god-forsaken British countryside in order to deliver a car at the request of his odd pal Caspar Femm. The two share an apartment, but they never see each other since Caspar always mysteriously vanishes before midnight. When he arrives at the sinister Femm country estate, he learns that all the eccentric family members are obliged to stay at the house and gather at midnight, or otherwise they lose the rights to their part of the inheritance of their notorious ancestor (a pirate). Synchronous with Tom's arrival, the family members are being killed off one by one. Tom should leave while, but he fell for the charming cousin Cecily and the remaining Femms suspect him to be the killer. "The Old Dark House" begins delightfully, with animated opening credits by none other than Charles Addams ? the creator of the immortal blackly comical series "The Addams Family ? and brings forward several great Gothic aspects, like a moody old castle and never-ending thunderstorms. Some of the supportive characters are also uniquely bizarre, like the crazy uncle who's building an arc or the grandmother that doesn't stop knitting, but overall the film isn't absurd or spooky enough. The actual "horror" footage in the film is limited, a few inventive death scenes and a laughably inept moment with a stuffed hyena.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not James Whale, but worth a look for William Castle fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this film doesn't hold a candle to the James Whale film from 1932, but if you put that film out of your mind and go into this William Castle film and take if for what it is - a William Castle film - you'll probably enjoy it. Like no other film I can think of, this "Old Dark House" is like a Mad magazine movie satire come to life. Actually, it's more like Mad magazine when it was a comic book back in the 1950s. It has none of the sophistication and witty dialog that mark the James Whale film, and neither does it have much to do with the J. B. Priestly book 'Benighted' that the earlier film followed so closely, but it does have a highly surreal wackiness that has more in common with a Tex Avery cartoon than a live action horror comedy.As a Hammer Film, it is also sumptuously art directed, with nicely dressed, if overly-lit, sets. Whereas the original film was about a group of travelers who find themselves stuck in a strange house inhabited by some insane, and in some cases, psychotic and dangerous family members, the William Castle film focuses on a single visitor, played by Tom Poston, who delivers a car to the Femm mansion to give the roommate friend who happens to be a member of the family. Upon arriving at the mansion, the car is ruined and Penderel is instantly "invited" into the house via a trap door at the front porch (that becomes a running gag); and he proceeds to watch family members killed off one by one. Each family member, you see, must stay in the house, or forfeit the family fortune. Does it make any sense? Only in weird William Castle logic. The film does have a bit of the Charles Addams black humor to it, particularly when the family keeps lowering the flag at half mast every time one of their members dies. These family members, while not as frighteningly bizarre as in Whale's film, are indeed a strange bunch. There's Roderick Femm, avid gun and canon collector, played by Robert Morley; Petiphar Femm, who plans on saving the world by building a new ark and populating it with Tom Penderel (Poston) and Morgana Femm (Fenella Fielding), as the ark's human specimens; Tom's roommate friend Caspar Femm and his twin brother, Jaspar, both played by Peter Bull eventually laying side by side dead in coffins, one strangled by fireplace stokers; crazy knitter Agatha Femm, played by Joyce Grenfell, who is offed by her own knitting needles; totally crazy and psychotic Morgan Femm (Danny Green), who seems to fill the threatening role of crazy Saul from the first film; but it is Cecily Femm, played by the sexy and beautiful Janette Scott (of "Day of the Triffids" fame) who brings the biggest surprise by being revealed as the actual psycho murderer amongst this crazy bunch.No, this is not a classic, but the atmospheric surroundings, a stuffed animal being shaken by someone off screen to suggest a fearsome hyena (the audacity of the cheapness!), the weird Noah's ark thing, and the sheer oddness of the whole production makes it very watchable. And it has a very good score by Benjamin Frankel, of all people. Only William Castle could have put something together so utterly surreal as this. Truly bizarre. Don't expect James Whale, and know what you're getting yourself in for and you'll probably have a good time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An old, dark and disappointing house!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I'm a big fan of William Castle and of Hammer Horror, so I figured that this meeting between the two would be damn good. William Castle's The Old Dark House is not a remake of the classic James Whale film, and this is actually unfortunate because if it was, it no doubt would have been a better film. Instead, what we have is a plot involving an American car dealer who goes to an old house after receiving an invitation from a friend of his, who he shares a house with. While there, he is introduced to a host of strange characters, as well as a plot involving a huge inheritance. The film is obviously intended to be a comedy, but it would seem that Castle should have stuck to horror as little in this film is actually funny, and I was really bored before the ending - not something I expect from William Castle! Considering the film focuses on an 'old dark house', there's very little in the way of atmosphere and I'm guessing that Castle wanted this film to appeal to a younger audience, and for that reason - there's not much here for the older movie fan. The plot rambles on until the conclusion and by then I didn't really care what happened. Overall, this is a sub standard William Castle film if ever I saw one. Straight-Jacket, Homicidal, Mr Sardonicus, The Tingler, House on Haunted Hill and 13 Ghosts come highly recommended - this one doesn't!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE OLD DARK HOUSE (William Castle, 1963) **</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I used to take people to task when they said that, being fond of a particular film, they would not watch some other version of the same source material?but, while I am a fan of Hammer Horror and (to a lesser extent) genre exponent William Castle, I have to admit to being guilty of this fault (or, if you like, bias) myself when it came to my all-time favorite movie ? James Whale's similarly-titled 1932 adaptation for Universal of J.B. Priestley's "Benighted"! For this reason, I have postponed viewing the by-all-accounts "best forgotten" remake (Castle apparently did, because he fails to mention it in his memoirs...and, apparently, Boris Karloff declined to participate in it for being overly jokey!) for the longest time but, in view of my ongoing Whale marathon, I thought it was high time I got around to it! By the way, though I recall coming across a copy of the novel as a kid (that is, long before I watched the original film), I have been searching high and low ever since catching up with it ? given that I was intrigued enough by the back-story to wish to concoct a veritable prequel!According to "The Leslie Halliwell Film Guide", the Whale picture had adhered fairly closely to the text albeit "omitting the more thoughtful moments"; the Hammer version, then, is nothing like Whale's but it does include a nice 'exclusive' subplot involving one character's attempt to reproduce Noah's Ark! In most other respects, however, the film is a dismal failure (a pitifully poor sequence supposedly depicting a hyena attack must be seen to be disbelieved!): comedy does not suit Castle (despite his tendency towards Camp), much less Hammer (their recognizable style only coming through here in the overall look, aided by Charles Addams' evocative animated title sequence; the latter is said to owe his choice of career to a viewing of Whale's original!) and the end result barely raises a chuckle ? with none of the subtle wit that so characterized the classic original! One grave mistake is the fact that only a single interloper is made to contend with the family of eccentrics, and resistible American comic Tom Poston at that; for the record, he had already collaborated with the director on the previous year's ZOTZ! (which I also own but have yet to check out).The Femms, on the other hand, are incarnated by a promising gallery of actors but to little effect: Robert Morley, Joyce Grenfell, Janette Scott, Fenella Fielding (who would play a similar role in CARRY ON SCREAMING [1966]), Peter Bull, Mervyn Johns and Danny Green; incidentally, Fielding and Bull would later appear together again in the period romp, LOCK UP YOUR DAUGHTERS! (1969) ? which I have just acquired. The Whale film had no young women, crazy or otherwise, within the household but there were indeed 2 among the stranded travelers. Whereas Morley is supposed to replace Elspeth (billed as John!) Dudgeon, Grenfell stands in for Eva Moore, Bull has a dual role (which, again, is a new addition) while Johns more or less emulates Brember Wills (since he is perhaps the looniest ? that said, his murderous inclinations are transferred onto one of the ladies, which is an agreeable novelty in itself!) and Green doubles for Karloff's giant mute butler (though, in this case, his dumbness is merely a ruse!).Even if the original was relatively uneventful (a criticism leveled at it by hardened horror-movie buffs not satiated by its inherent stylized quirkiness), this one takes the form of an Agatha Christie whodunnit, with characters being eliminated one by one (among the murder methods are having water replaced by acid and, most ingeniously, a shotgun going off 'accidentally') over an inheritance ? even Poston is linked with (and suspected of) this, which detaches it all the more from Whale's infinitely superior rendition! As if to emphasize this shift from Gothic horror to murder mystery, Hammer released the film theatrically in black-and-white (as per their current standard for thrillers) despite having shot it in color?with the latter prints only cropping up as TV screenings (which is how I came across my copy) and, fairly recently, DVD!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Dead-End "William Castle" Whodunit/Comedy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just like Castle's movie "Zotz!", The Old, Dark House was yet another inane farce that easily proved just how clueless this guy was at directing Comedy (more so than he was with directing Horror).Once again (just like with "Zotz!") this less-than-funny, hare-brained story had the distinctive feel of being an imitation (a very poor imitation) of a typical Disney, family movie of the early 1960s. This film's targeted audience was that of children under 10 who obviously had very low expectations about what was entertaining and what wasn't.This film certainly had all sorts of potential to be a really fun and humorous story for all ages. But it seemed that at the hands of such a clueless amateur like William Castle, its story just didn't come anywhere near to living up to that potential.At every opportunity to generate some genuine laughs, Castle missed the mark, over and over again, and let its story fall flat on its face and flounder around in what seemed like a literal no-man's land of B-grade mediocrity.I believe that The Old, Dark House was one of the few Castle films that was actually shot in colour.This film's story is something of a "Whodunit". It involves the peculiar specifics of a family Will, the 7 eccentric relatives who all reside at Femm Hall (a grand, old, English mansion falling into ruin), and an American outsider who inadvertently gets dragged into an unpleasant family affair that goes way beyond his power of control.One of this film's biggest downfalls was Castle's inability to build suspense, sustain drama and be humorous, all at the same time. Long before it's actually revealed, the viewer will have no trouble guessing the identity of the killer who's been bumping off all of the Femms at Femm Hall.This is not a good movie. I don't even recommend it as entertainment for young children. Let's face it, William Castle just didn't have the knack for creating memorable Comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As this film begins, you are bound to notice the wonderful opening credits done by Charles Addams. I do wonder if the hand is that of Addams, though! You have to see it to understand what I mean.The film begins with an American (Tom Poston) being invited by his English friend to come to spend the weekend at his ancestral home in Dartmoor. However, once he arrives, he finds that his friend is dead--lying in state in the creepy old mansion. But, like any scary old house film, the car is damaged and unable to take him home AND the rain is so bad that he really can't leave. That is when the murders begin and it becomes obvious that the house is filled with a bunch of nuts.The film is supposed to be a comedic remake of the classic 1932 film. However, I use the words 'supposed to' because rarely is the film particularly funny and the humor seems very, very forced. In many ways, it looks like a film that Sherwood Schwartz or Hanna-Barbera would have made--with perhaps the Brady kids or even Scooby Doo and Shaggy investigating. This combined with the fact that there have been too many old scary house films (such as AND THEN THERE WERE NONE, THE MONSTER, NUMBER SEVENTEEN, THE BLACK CAT and many, many others) make this one you don't need to rush out to see.By the way, in one of the low-points of the film, a hyena is supposedly menacing Tom Poston. However, the camera shots of the hyena from the front clearly show it's a stuffed animal!! The rear shots are a dog!! Sloppy, sloppy, sloppy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>William Castle directed this remake, co-produced with Hammer Studios, of the 1932 original directed by James Whale, which had starred Boris Karloff and Charles Laughton. Based on the novel by J.B. Priestly, this version casts Tom Poston as Tom Penderil, an American car salesman in England who is invited to a castle inhabited by the eccentric Femm Family, who are also reclusive. There is a strain of madness and murder in this home, and Tom may not make it out alive... Dreadful and instantly forgettable film is far too reliant on unfunny comedy, poorly executed, with bizarre and ineffectual horror. A complete and total waste of time.

		<fullReview>Zotz!.. another William Castle and Tom Poston lighthearted dark adventure for all ages. Amusing quips and snappy banter abound. There are some plot contrivances (typically par for the Castle course). The Old Dark House would surely have been better suited for black and white film stock as the milieu is inherently sinister. That being said the full color palette does tend to heighten the humor elements of the story as Poston's pink puppy dog cheeks remind us of how sweet and naive a witless hero can be. However, the chromatic compromise confounds establishment of mood and thus character motivation. A third of the duration of the film passes prior to the formation of a real clue about the plot (which according to other reviewers holds little sway in the realm of fidelity to the original Priestly story or Whale film from the thirties). The staging/blocking and mobile framing are not constructed with any technical finesse or creative flair. I tend to find that Castle's best directing efforts are inspired by higher quality scripts he works with. For Castle, when the storytelling stammers his direction staggers and his authorial voice goes mute. There are shades of this crutch in The Old Dark House. Similar to Zotz!, Poston plays a character that reminds one of Leonid Gaidai's Shurik character - fumbling and bumbling through the simplest of tasks, getting himself into trouble way over his head, and gallantly dodging sexy, seductive women who throw themselves at him bosom to face. If you wanted to probe and plumb this film for some deeper value, try a psychoanalytic approach (either Freud or Lacan will do). Personally, I wouldn't bother... but you never know. As it stands, this is an amusing film that is best watched while doing something more important.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There goes a cherished childhood memory</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have three great memories of watching horror movies when I was a kid - the first was seeing House of Dark Shadows in the movie theater and having an incredibly, intense nightmare and sleepwalking episode that night. The second was seeing House on Haunted Hill on Creature Features and shivering throughout the movie because I was so scared. Both of those memories have stood up after seeing those movies again. The one that did not was my memory of The Old Dark House by William Castle. I remember the day I watched it and how deliciously scared it made me with people being bumped off left and right and Tom Posten (SPOILERS AHEAD) running around near the end of the movie looking for the bombs hidden in the clock. I even remember being shocked when the mastermind behind all the killings was blown up at the end. Well, I finally saw the movie for the first time in more than 30 years and while it was mildly amusing, I found it to be amazingly dull. The original - with Boris Karloff - is a great spooky house chiller, but in the remake Castle went more for humor and gimmickry and it failed badly. When the movie was over, all I could think was, "There goes a cherished childhood memory."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this second screen version of J.B. Priestleys' book, Tom Poston plays Tom Penderel, an American living in London who makes his living as a car salesman. He shares a flat with Caspar Femm (Peter Bull), who uses the place in the daytime while Tom sleeps there at night. One day Caspar implores Tom to come visit him at the Femm estate, which is up for grabs. Tom is then forced to deal with the wacky Femm family for one every eventful evening.One would have expected a collaboration between gimmick master William Castle and Britains' legendary Hammer Studios to be more fun. It's more of a comedy than a horror film, and only a fitfully amusing one. There are some funny gags, but it just falls flat a lot of the time. It basically serves to make fun of the entire "old dark house" genre, complete with the expected tropes (like a dark, stormy night). It's decent light entertainment, but is eminently forgettable. It looks great, which is what the viewer expects from Hammer films (a lot of the crew are the usual Hammer suspects). But it doesn't have the level of atmosphere that's really required for most stories of this type.The likable Poston leads a sterling British cast that helps to keep this version of "The Old Dark House" watchable for 87 minutes. Robert Morley is gun nut Roderick Femm, Janette Scott the striking blonde Cecily, Joyce Grenfell the doddering matriarch Agatha, Mervyn Johns the upbeat Potiphar, Fenella Fielding the slinky Morgana, and Danny Green the hulking, silent Morgan. (If Popeye had been turned into a live action feature in the 60s, Green might have made for a good Bluto.)This kills time without too much pain, but it's far from grade A Castle *or* Hammer.Title illustrations by Charles Addams.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

Robert Morley is always a joy to watch. The twins (Casper &amp; Jasper) are a strange lot, as well as the other characters in this old dark house. They would probably fit in well at the Addams' home- if it weren't for the fact that they start dropping like flies. Who is the killer? Will Poston live long enough to find out?

		<fullReview>While many critics don't like this version of the Old, Dark House, in fact, some of them prefer the Boris Karloff version; I have to confess I like this version. I first saw this when I was a kid, and found myself absorbed by the mystery and surprised by the identity of the killer. As an adult, I can confess who it is--is a pretty obvious, but still I liked this film and I think Tom Poston is underrated for his work in this film. It's sort of like the Addams Family, with a murder mystery added to it. It should be out on video or DVD, and I hope William Castle fans will try to get it out a bit more to the public. A horror film, that doesn't have any blood and gore, just some comic suspense, and the revelation of the killer is well-played out.I liked it. Sincerely, JSmithcarolyn@dia.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>JB Priestley's 1927 novel 'Benighted' was adapted very loosely into 1932's classic 'The Old Dark House', which was directed by James Whale in his own very distinct style. This in turn has been adapted equally loosely by Director William Castle for Hammer films.'The Old Dark House' stars Tom Poston, an American actor with a wonderful permanently harassed expression as Tom Penderel, a car dealer who delivers a car to a large mansion for Casper Femm, whom he subsequently discovers is dead. He meets Cecily Femm (Jeanette Scott) who warns him to leave before 'the family' find him. 'The family' are spoken of in dread tones.The worst excesses of this production are demonstrated with the arrival of Fenella Fielding's Morgana. As she floats down the stairs to greet Penderel, the 'comedy music' (an unnecessary irritation in my view ? if something is funny, the audience will laugh; if we need music to tell us something is funny, there is something wrong. Here, it works directly against any dark vein of humour events may be trying to evoke) accompanies the camera's lingering obsession with her breasts. A sign of the times of course, but worlds away from the original Universal version.There are positives and negatives about this, but the overall effect is disappointing. The cast is made up of uniformly excellent, eccentric performers that seem curiously underwritten. The story is a drawing room mystery, and I have no problem with that, but it is 'enlivened' by comedy routines so pedestrian (although enthusiastically played) they hardly fulfill the promise of the publicity that 'you'll die laughing.' If the flamboyant cast had been directed by an equally unconventional director, things could have been pushed into a less in-house style. Having said that, William Castle went onto produce the acclaimed 'Rosemary's Baby' five years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a London casino, American car salesman Tom Poston (as Thomas "Tom" Penderel) accepts an invitation to visit an eccentric English friend's dilapidated old mansion. He arrives at "Femm Hall" during a rainstorm, hoping to meet some of his friend's female cousins. "I like girls," Mr. Poston says. Poston arrives to discover his host in a coffin. Equally eccentric Robert Morley (as Roderick Femm) invites Poston to stay, exclaiming, "It's not every day that we have an American for dinner..."Poston is nearly seduced by both attractive blonde Janette Scott (as Cecily) and perpetually aroused Fenella Fielding (as Morgana). There is some hint Poston might re-populate the Earth, after copulating with one of these women - but nothing comes of it. Due to the extended rain, Bible-believing Mervyn Johns (as Potiphar) is collecting animals for his ark. He hopes to include Poston as a human specimen. But murder takes priority in this story, as family members begin to meet their maker...The storyline deviates wildly from the original J.B. Priestley novel (and similarly titled 1932 film). Though produced and directed by William Castle, for the horrific "Hammer" studios of Great Britain, this is a broad comedy. As such, it gets a little more tiresome every quarter hour. The low point may be Poston being joined in his bed by "Penelope the hyena" - a special effect which evokes the wrong kind of laughter. "The Old Dark House" picks up after petering out, with a lively ending.***** The Old Dark House (10/30/63) William Castle ~ Tom Poston, Robert Morley, Fenella Fielding, Janette Scott</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Old Dark House is directed by William Castle and adapted to screenplay by Robert Dillon from the novel Benighted written by J.B. Priestly. It stars Tom Poston, Robert Morley, Janette Scott, Joyce Grenfell, Mervyn Jones, Fenella Fielding, Peter Bull and Danny Green. Music is by Benjamin Frankel and cinematography by Arthur Grant.In essence a remake of James Whales' 1932 adaptation of the Priestly story, William Castle's film is very much an oddity and pitched somewhere between a live cartoon and a feverish campy dream. Even if you ignore Whale's popular movie, which while not easy to do is something you should at least try to do, this version is just too nutty for its own good.It's not a complete wash out as a film at all, there is some value to be had with a roll call of quality British thespians acting it up alongside "token" American Poston. It's colourfully lurid and the pratfalls are honest and often smile inducing. But it at times comes over as a picture to be viewed with a considerable intake of liquor! Then the murders would become suitably grotesque in a Munsters/Addams Family kind of way and the live wire Poston should be tolerable.Typically of a Castle production there's cheapness within (oh my that Hyenna), but again that can be ignored in context to the strangeness of the piece anyway. The opening credits are neat and set the tone for the cartoonery, a tone kept up by Frankel's musical accompaniments, while the production design for the house is, well, strange. Hard to recommend with confidence to anyone other than boozers or cartoon loving insomniacs, The Old Dark House is at the least unforgettable. 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was the result of an unfortunate marriage between William Castle and Hammer Films and it is hard to find much to get excited about. Tom Poston isn't much of an actor and can barely keep the pace in his lighter-than-air role.The attempts at humor - and they are everywhere - fizzle for the most part. They are mainly the domain of a comic book and not much more. They might appeal more to children. however or to the memory laners. The wall-to-wall music is overwhelming and after a while works against the film, despite some clever moments in the orchestration. So, what is there to recommend? The same title of a film made in 1932 by James Whale! Now that's good film making.Curtis Stotlar</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has nothing to do with the 1932 James Whale masterpiece that still has fans shouting, "No beds! They can't have beds!" That melodrama of madness and murder was at least funny with its collection of eccentric characters, but this one is just plain ridiculous, trying too hard and succeeding not at all. Poor Tom Poston ("Mork and Mindy", "Newhart") is the sap who discovers that through a distant pirate relative of the family tree that he may be related to this house of wackos, possibly one of the heirs to a gloomy British mansion where the residents are all balmy in one way or another. Played as if it was spoofing the traveling melodramas that usually starred someone like Tod Slaughter in the British hinterlands, this fails to achieve its goal of being a comedy, lacking in suspense and the usual surprises of William Castle's collection of camp 60's cult classics.Broadly played, this makes what humor there is there seem forced, and even the droll Robert Morley fails to offer amusement as the family's domineering patriarch. At least some Charles Addams drawings entertain during the credits. As if an afterthought, this also utilizes some of the character's names from the original, even though it has no other relation. It is a pity that Castle didn't cast his "13 Ghosts" actress Margaret Hamilton in the Eva Moore role here; That would have been much more inspired than anything that happens here. My favorite quote from this movie actually came out of my mouth, not the characters, that being, "You've Got to Be Kidding!"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Campy comedy about an expatriate American who sells cars in England and gets invited by an eccentric millionaire to visit the man's ancestral estate. The ancestral mansion turns out to be something right out of a Charles Addams' cartoon (Addams in fact drew the opening sequence) and it is chock full of oddball relatives. One by one, during a torrential storm, they are knocked off by unseen hands. I'd not seen this film before, but it was easy enough to spot the killer. Tom Poston plays the befuddled American, and Robert Morley plays a gun-toting member of the nutty clan. Plenty of slapstick bits but no scares, as one might have expected from the title. Director William Castle helmed this remake of a 1937 classic, and has a lot of fun with it. Great musical score, and some fetching females to keep up the interest. Excellent sets and color. Worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Old, Dark, and Slightly Boring House...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being a huge fan of Castle and of Hammer films, I had high expectations for this one. On top of that, I'd seen the original Old Dark House which was quite spooky and entertaining. Unfortunately, this version was a little on the dull side for me. Don't get me wrong, I'd definitely recommend a viewing, although make certain that it's early in the day. I made the mistake of watching at my usual post-11pm horror film slot. I fell asleep (which I rarely do) and had to watch the end the next morning. The cast is quite good and the vibe is sufficiently moody. I loved the eccentric Femm clan. They're all a bunch of nut jobs and their antics are quite humorous in the beginning, but it becomes dull and predictable about halfway through the film. It's also very obvious near the start that the killer is the sweetest, most innocent member of the family. Add to that the fact that, for a campy comedy, there is not much camp or solid comedy and you have a film that has great potential, but doesn't quite live up to it. All in all, I'd give this a 6/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly...and I don't mean that in a good sense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tom Poston was one of my favorite character actors on quite a few television shows, and I remember him fondly from another film of his -- "Zotz". But frankly, this film demonstrates why he never became a significant film actor. This film is just 86 minutes of silliness...and that's not a compliment. I can't even figure out what audience it was aimed at. Too juvenile for adults, and too adultish (in places) for kids.The cast is somewhat appealing. It's difficult not to like Tom Poston (here as an American in England), but I'm not sure he has enough depth to carry a film. Robert Morley is around as one of the odd Brits, but I grew tired of him very, very long ago. Well, that's about it in terms of names Americans will recognize, although several of the other actors did nicely enough.The plot is pretty thin. Relatives in a seemingly haunted house are being murdered one by one. Who is the murderer? Mostly there's just a lot of silliness, some of which should have been cut all together, or at least condensed. And even then, 86 minutes was too long.I adored Tom Poston, but not in this lemon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One half of a good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although supposedly a remake of the James Whale film (and the J. B. Priestley book on which it's based) William Castle's OLD DARK HOUSE really has nothing in common with either except the titular domicile and a few character names. This movie starts out very promisingly, with Charles Addams' delightful credits complimented by Benjamin Frankel's lovely score, both eerie and lyrical. The opening scenes remind one of the darker Ealing comedies (KIND HEARTS AND CORONETS, THE LADYKILLERS), what with the great cast of British character actors led by the wonderful Robert Morley, and the production values are up to the usual Hammer standard. Then about halfway through, starting with the scene where Tom Poston is "menaced" by a stuffed hyena, the movie goes downhill and never recovers. Now, I understand the difficulties of making a movie with limited resources but how anyone ever thought they could pass off this refugee from a taxidermist's as a real animal boggles the mind. And the Ark sequence, while promising in concept, is very badly executed. The miniature work is just too obvious to pass muster and the interior of the ark looks like it was shot at a broken down zoo somewhere, with little effort made to transform it into a boat interior. And so it goes, right down the toilet. A big disappointment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of The Old Dark House is a remake of the one that starred Boris Karloff but not as good. Not too bad though.An American working in England as a car seller accepts an invitation to Femm House, not realising the strange and nasty goings on there. He arrives and its not long before murders start. Members of the Femm Family are being bumped off in various ways, including shootings (one of them collects guns as a hobby) and stranglings. As is always the case in these sort of movies, the murderer is not the person you would expect...This movie is a little daft in parts especially the scenes with one of the family members recreating the Noah's Ark, certainly not got anything to do with the main story. It does have its creepy moments though, the thunderstorm helping this.A good cast: Tom Poston and British stars Robert Morley (The African Queen, A Study In Terror), Janette Scott (The Day of the Triffids), Fenella Fielding (Carry On Screaming), Joyce Grenfell, Mervyn Johns (Dead of Night, Scrooge) and Peter Bull.Though not brilliant, this version of The Old Dark House is worth viewing.Rating: 2 and a half stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Spoiler ahead) Joyce Grenfell as the intrepid knitter stands out in my memory, probably because I was watching the St. Trinian's movies that she appeared in during the same time period. Her character knitted by the mile (not the mile-a-minute of crochet/knitting patterns) and the colors would change depending on her mood. There was a strip of (probably) yellow that she remarked was done on a "particularly dreadful day". It didn't matter whether the movie was in black and white or color because we had a b/w TV (which is where I saw it). She was murdered by having her knitting needles stuck cross ways through her neck. Mervyn Johns (Glynis Johns' father) was funny as the little man building an ark in the garden. I thought of him as this character just a few years later when we had a really bad, days long rainstorm in Southern California (where I grew up). I would really love to see it again. I absolutely adore British character actors. No matter how dreadful the material (I didn't really think this was so dreadful when I was 13 but who knows in my 50s?) they can make one smile or laugh out loud.Black and white or color, I hope Columbia releases it. They're usually short on extras on the DVDs but in this case I'd overlook it.</fullReview>

I searched e-bay and found a DVD for sale, but I'm assuming from the item itself that it's a bootleg. More the pity. Tom Posten is an American in Britain selling cars. He sells one to Casper Femm. When he tries to deliver it, Casper asks if he would drive it to Femm hall while he, Casper flies back. He does, only to find that Casper has died an hour before his arrival. From there things rapidly deteriorate. All the residents of Femm hall have to remain every night in the house to keep their share of their inheritance, and all of them are certifiably crazy. A supposed remake of the original Old Dark House done in 1932 with Boiris Karloff, the two movies have very little in common. This is just a great piece of light hearted black comedy, and well worth the watching.</fullReview>

Tom Poston plays an innocent bystander trapped in a house of loonies. The strange occupants are not allowed out of the house after a certain time to avoid losing an inheritance. There's the obligatory storm (one of the crazies builds an ark!), strange voices, dead bodies, etc. As strange as this movie is, it seems normal up against Castle's SHANKS (1974). Terry Castle, William's daughter, is producing a batch of remakes of her fathers famous films. This will not be one of them.</fullReview>

The murders are bloodless and supposed to be funny (they aren't). Some of the acting is good. Poston is very good playing the straight man basically. Robert Morley hams it up as the head of the household. Janette Scott has the thankless "good girl" part (but plays it well) and Fanella Fielding REALLY chews the scenery as the bad girl Morgana. The script drags, the revelation of the killer is no surprise and there's tons of very unfunny slapstick. It's also VERY loud. Kids might like this--adults probably won't. I expected more from a co-production between William Castle and Hammer Studios.Trivia note: For some reason this was released theatrically in black &amp; white...it's in color on TV.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This horrible "Remake" of the James Whale masterpiece bears no resemblance to the earlier film, and has a terrible contrived plot. It can be endured only for the performances of some excellent comedy players, Tom Poston (An underrated comedy genius - not that you could tell that from this mess), Robert Morley, Peter Bull, Joyce Grenfell and Finnella Fielding. Whereas the humor in the Whale version was understated and subtle, here it is hammered into you with a sledge hammer, and emphasized with a ham-fisted musical score that hollers at you that something is funny, which is actually a help, as it's the only way to tell when it's supposed to be funny, since it never actually is. Nor is it scary. William Castle, the Hitchcock of hacks, has made MUCH better movies, such as "Rosemary's Baby". Rocky Horror fans will recognize Janette Scott from "Day of the Triffids" (As well as Mervyn John from that same movie) and that the exterior of the house is the same house as used in Rocky Horror. When it was released, this film was thought so little of by it's makers that it was released in black and white. Only now can you see it in color. But why would you want to?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Complete Misfire for Hammer and Castle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old Dark House, The (1963) * 1/2 (out of 4) Gimmick master William Castle went to England to work with Hammer in this semi-remake of James Whale's 1932 film. In the film, a car salesman (Tom Poston) brings some bad luck to his boss so he is asked to deliver a car personally to his home. Once at the creepy mansion he finds the boss is now dead and he must spend the night with his rather strange and eccentric family. From what I've read and heard, Castle was tired of critics saying he couldn't produce a film without all the gimmick so he went to England to make this and prove them wrong. The plan backfired as the film was a bomb at the box office and I personally don't see how anyone could enjoy this thing. There are a lot of issues with this film but it's clear that Castle lost something on his way overseas. For starters, fans of the 1932 film aren't going to find too many things in common with this film. Whereas that film contained some black humor, this one here pretty much plays everything for laughs. I don't have a problem with that except that the jokes here are terrible and I can only remember laughing once. The second problem is that it's never quite clear what Castle is trying to do. Yes, the humor is out front but the story is all over the place and it's never really centered on anything. The actual murders are meant to be funny but they're not. The dialogue is meant to be funny but it's not. Castle was known for delivering some campy laughs in his films but this thing here is just a complete misfire from start to finish. One positive aspect is the color photography but I was shocked to learn that the film was eventually released theatrically in B&amp;W with the color prints only be shown on television! I'm really not sure who this film was meant for because fans of the 1932 film aren't going to like it and I doubt fans of Castle are going to like it either. It's an interesting train wreck but folks should certainly stay away.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nine Little Addams</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A practically legendary movie (the original 1932 version) is remade here with quite a few changes, none for the better. Poston is an American living in England, sharing a flat with a portly, rather odd man (Bull.) Bull invites Poston to his family manor to help him through some difficulties, but by the time Poston arrives, Bull is already dead from a fall. Poston is then introduced to the oddball members of the family. Johns is an eccentric who believes that The Great Flood is about to be repeated, Grenfell is a dotty old woman who knits continuously, Morley is suspicious and gun-obsessed, Fielding is a sex-starved seductress with a wildly overprotective father (Green) and Scott is the pretty, "normal" one. It turns out that all of these family members have to live in the mansion in order to collect their inheritance, yet one of them would like to reduce the number of beneficiaries greatly. So, one by one, they begin to get picked off while Poston struggles to find out who is behind the killings. It's a sort of "The Addams Family" meets "Ten Little Indians" set-up. (Charles Addams even illustrates the opening credits.) Unfortunately, the movie never rises above TV sitcom-level script and dialogue. There's a healthy amount of slapstick, none of it particularly funny. Having the film in color only reduces the creepiness of it, though even in black and white it wouldn't be scary at all. The house is old, but could hardly be called dark with the flood lighting used throughout. The only thing that is of interest is the work of several cast members. Poston tries hard (sometimes too hard) to stir up some comedy and energy in the film, but is only partly successful. Morley is solid and on target in his portrayal. Grenfell has a few nice moments as she knits and knits. Scott is adequate in her "Marilyn Munster"-esque part. Of most interest is the downright strange appearance of Fielding. Buried under a heavy, helmet-like wig, false eyelashes and the most insane pancake make-up ever seen (her face is pale grey and her hands are tan!) and with a smoky, raspy voice, she comes off as a sort of loony drag queen. She is, all at once, seductive, creepy, funny, scary, bizarre, ridiculous and fascinating. It's worth a viewing just to check out this crazy person! One scene has Poston being "viciously" threatened by a salivating stuffed hyena! The film may please undemanding fans who liked TV shows like "My Mother the Car" or those who want to see what Poston was like as a younger man, but it shouldn't even be mentioned in the same breath as the original.</fullReview>
