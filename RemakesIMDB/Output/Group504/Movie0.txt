		<shortDescription>One of my all-time favorites</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford would consent to appear in a movie together is amazing. Shearer in 1939 was the queen of MGM, being the widow of Irving Thalberg, and had her choice of material and co-stars. Crawford, although a power in her own right, didn't have Shearer's pull and complained bitterly about it. Crawford agreed to take the somewhat supporting, albeit juicy, role because she needed an A picture after a string of flops. So she had to suck it up to work with Shearer.The two stars had only one scene alone together, and there were no reported problems, except one. Director George Cukor sent Crawford home early when she caused a distraction by loudly clicking her knitting needles off camera as Shearer tried to do her close-ups.Crawford was proved right in taking the movie, it's one of her most memorable and, finally for once, villainous roles. As Crystal Allen, the scheming shopgirl out to sleep her way to a Park Avenue penthouse, she was ideally cast. It was her life. Rosalind Russell, previously not known as a comedienne, surprised everyone with her rapid-fire sarcastic delivery. She would continue to perfect the biting style for 20 years until she reached the pinnacle with Auntie Mame. Roz gives the strongest performance of the film as the viciously catty Sylvia Fowler, and I don't think Shearer or Crawford knew what hit them.As for the long-suffering, hair-clutching, heavy-sighing Norma Shearer, even she was able to make the difficult role of saintly Mary Haines memorable. One of her best moments is when she raises her nails and growls "I've had two years to grow claws, Mother, and they're Jungle Red!," and then goes to take her man back from Crawford. Unfortunately, Shearer has a few Silent Screen moments that look out of place, such as collapsing and weeping at her mother's knee. But she makes the character warm and likable and we root for her to win. There are many gems in the supporting cast. Most spectacular is Mary Boland as the heavy-drinking, high-living Countess De Lave. "L'amour L'amour" she wails as she's about to divorce her fourth studly husband -- for trying to kill her. Paulette Goddard, the most beautiful member of the cast, is the best I've seen her, as the streetwise Miriam Aarons. Like Crawford, she plays a role she understands, the chorus girl who snags a millionaire. But unlike Crystal, Miriam has a heart -- and Goddard is great at doling out straight-shooting advice and rolling out put-downs under her breath.Marjorie Main gives a preview of the persona she would later use as Ma Kettle. It was the first time she was able to step out and create the character, and she used it the rest of her career. I never tired of her raucous horse laugh.I hope Hollywood has the good sense not to attempt a remake with an update of this classic. Time would not be kind. It is a priceless diamond in a golden setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women as Darwinian Predators</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Women having cat fights over men never looked better than they did in George Cukor's adaptation of Clare Boothe-Luce's hit Broadway play. An all-star cast of actresses (which included the established, the Broadway vets, and the rising in one huge ensemble), THE WOMEN never once seems as if it's aged a bit because its story could very well be placed in a modern setting. The only shame I think is that its release coincided with the year 1939. There were too many other movies that were already vying for recognition and because of this massive competition it got lost in the shuffle. Had its release been withheld until the following year, there's no doubt it would have gotten at least an acting nomination, or multiple nominations in different categories including best picture.The story at the center is any woman's nightmare: that her husband is having an affair and that everyone but her knows about it. Norma Shearer is this woman. She plays Mary Haines, happily married to Stephen Haines and mother of Little Mary. She has no idea that Stephen is having a torrid affair with perfume clerk Crystal Allen, but Sylvia does (as does everyone else) and plans to have Mary find out about it. Sylvia uses the communication skills of a manicurist to have Mary find out about her husband's secret, and things boil up to a crescendo at a fashion show when both Mary and Crystal meet and spar. Mary decides after an argument to leave her husband in a quickie divorce signing at Reno where she meets not only the eccentric Countess deLave but Miriam Aarons, who is the other woman in the Fowler marriage. Sylvia later also arrives in tears and then finds out that Miriam is set to be the next Mrs. Fowler and a fight ensues. At the last moment, Mary gets a call from Stephen: he will marry Crystal Allen after all. Crystal, now the new Mrs. Stephen Haines, takes to his money and her new lifestyle with a vengeance and makes Stephen pretty miserable. On top of that, she is carrying on with a new guy, Buck, who was up to now the Countess deLave's husband. Sylvia of course learns of this, and the news reaches Mary's ears, who tries to win back her husband and re-kindle her marriage using the same viciousness used against her.At first glance this is a pretty straightforward comedy of manners among the women who inhabit this world -- who are more real than anyone would like to imagine. However, there are a lot of little elements that the script adaptation of Booth-Luce's play tell about women and how they see not only other women in society, rich or poor, but how they see themselves in a world where the next young thing could displace them and their perfect homes. In essence, this is the first movie to tackle the issue of divorce so successfully and movies like THE FIRST WIVES' CLUB and the TV soaps MELROSE PLACE and DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES owe a lot to THE WOMEN. The use of the term 'sister' is an interesting one, it being at the heart of the feminist movement -- female bonding is one of the film's strongest points and serves as a counterpart to the viciousness that we see early on. Interesting that Miriam Aarons, herself an "other woman" is the first to come up with the term. She is the exact opposite of Crystal Allen. She also comes from the streets but is a well-meaning woman and Paulette Goddard plays her like she herself has been there.Cukor definitely knows his actresses and extracts their best performances of their careers. Of the main actresses, the only one to have been past her prime is Norma Shearer but she gives here her last great performance. Restrained, at times even underplayed, vulnerable in a world of female sharks, watch for the scene when she collapses into tears at the news that her husband will marry another woman. This other woman, played by Joan Crawford at a time when she needed the boost in her career (albeit a temporary one), is vicious, made of steel, and Crawford sinks her teeth and claws into Crystal, all growls and purrs, and literally walks off with the movie. Too bad she wasn't considered for a Best Supporting Oscar. This is her best performance on screen, multi-layered, fascinating. An interesting sequence between her and Virginia Weidler (who outdoes her admirably in a sensitive role) playing Mary's daughter is one with future "Mommie Dearest" echoes. And needless to say the rich comedic timing that Rosalind Russell brings to pretty horrific character, Sylvia Fowler. What an actress! She pulls out all the stops in her scenes, going from plain bitchy, to conniving, to furious, to deceived, and all the time in that rapid-fire speech of hers. Marjorie Main, Mary Boland, Lucille Watson, and Joan Fontaine are all great -- well written characters all directed by the equally great George Cukor who has created a timeless classic with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This, by far, is the greatest classic bitch film of all time. It can never be equaled. They tried, but failed, when trying to remake it a musical with a less than glamorous casting of the roles made famous by the all-star female cast of the original written by Clare Boothe Luce. George Cukor, the director, had his hands full with the likes of these dames of fame. Each, in their own right, could steal a scene if left up to them, and they tried. But Cukor, held tight to the reins and kept them all in line. The beginning credits were cleverly done with each star being represented by an animal. Norma Shearer, the doe; the delicious Joan Crawford, a tiger; Roz Russell a cat; Paulette Goddard, a fox; Marjorie Main, a mule; Joan Fontaine, a lamb.My favorite scenes were the fight scene with Goddard and Russell, bath scene with Crawford, and last scene when all THE WOMEN go at it at the ball. With wonderful, crisp dialogue, beautiful costumes designed by Adrian and a stellar cast, you can see the sparks fly in this all-time classic comedy of 1939.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Women" owes its appeal to the great George Cukor. Without him, it would certainly have been a different movie. Because of his direction this is a Hollywood classic at its best.They certainly don't make pictures like this anymore. Imagine what it would have cost to have a first rate cast to fill the shoes of all these women in today's Hollywood? It would probably be so prohibitive that no one in the present climate would touch it with a ten foot pole."The Women", as written by Clare Booth Luce for the stage, was a delicious comedy about New York society, as it was in the late 30s. Of course, by today's standards, this is a very chaste take on that subject. Had it been done today, it would have been done entirely different and the excellent text by Ms. Luce would have probably been thrown away to satisfy the taste of contemporary audiences.Norma Shearer was excellent as Mary Haines, the suffering wife, who has no clue of how her husband has fallen to the charms of Crystal Allen, beautifully played by Joan Crawford. Rosalind Russell, Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and the rest of the cast seem to be having a lot of fun while playing these women. One thing does come clear, those women had a style and a sophistication well beyond the times they lived. It's very clear that Claire Booth Luce was well ahead of it all, as she had an understanding for what was going on around her. What a thrill it must have been to have been around New York in that glamorous era!Women: Love them, as we cannot live without them!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Legendary Comedy Available On DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The female of the species goes jungle red in tooth and claw in this brilliant screen adaptation of Claire Boothe Luce's famous Broadway play--a wickedly funny portrait of 1930s society women whose lives revolve around beauty treatments, luncheons, fashion shows, and each other's men. Socialite Mary Haines is the envy of her set: rich, beautiful, and happily married... but when her husband steps out on her with a gold-digging perfume counter sales clerk, Mary's so-called friends dish enough dirt to make divorce inevitable whether Mary wants it or not.The script is wickedly, mercilessly funny, fast paced, razor sharp and filled with such memorable invective that you'll be quoting it for weeks and months afterward: "He says he'd like to do Sylvia's nails right down to the wrist with a buzz-saw;" "Why that old gasoline truck, she's sixty if she's a minute;" "Gimme a bromide--and put some gin in it!" And the all-female cast, which includes every one from Cora Witherspoon to Butterfly McQueen to Hedda Hopper, plays it with tremendous spark.This was the last significant starring role for Norma Shearer, one of MGM's greatest stars of the 1930s, and she acquits herself very well as the much-wronged Mary Haines. But the real winners are the members of the supporting cast. Joan Crawford is truly astonishing as Crystal Allen, the shop girl who leads Mary's husband astray, and Rosalind Russell gives an outrageously funny performance as the back-biting gossip whose nasty comments precipitate Mary's divorce. Indeed, it is hard to do anything except rave about the entire the cast, which includes such diverse performers as Marjorie Main, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, and Lucille Watson. Even the smallest bit parts score with one-liners that have the impact of a slap in the face, and director George Cukor does an incredible job of keeping everything and every one in sharp focus.Perhaps one of the most interesting things about THE WOMEN is the way in which director Cukor ties the behavior of its characters to their social status. Possessed of absolute leisure and considerable wealth, their energies are inevitably directed into competition for the ultimate status symbol: a successful man. Cukor allows us to sympathize with Mary (Shearer) and laugh at Sylvia (Russell), but he also requires us to pity them--and indirectly encourages grudging admiration for the devious Crystal (Crawford) and the savvy Miriam (Goddard), characters who are considerably more self-reliant. Consequently, not only does THE WOMEN paint a poisonously funny portrait of women as a sex, it takes a hatchet to the society that has shaped their characters as well.Unfortunately, this landmark comedy has not received the full benefit of what DVD offers. Although the print is crisp, the film has not been restored, and the extras are spurious and hardly do the film justice; while I would recommend the DVD simply because you're likely to wear out a VHS, the DVD has no great advantage over the VHS release. But whether you have it on VHS or DVD, this is one title that you must have in your collection: you'll watch it again and again. A must-have! Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Quintessential Film of the Late 30's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There were so many excellent films produced in 1939, but this is the best at showing (what Hollywood wanted to show) the current times. It showcases so many wonderful actresses all at once. Norma Shearer is just outstanding; this is my favorite movie of hers.It also shows the values and thinking about women's roles at that time; but challenges them at the same time. As embodied by Mary's mother-in-law, there's a feeling of "boys will be boys" and the thought that even though her husband is playing around (for no good reason given - they seem to be a happy couple), Mary should let him get his "wild oats" out of his system, and look the other way. On the other hand, it shows a rich and varied view of all types of women, intelligent, catty, gentle, vicious, etc. They are not necessarily defined by the men in their lives - who are not shown. It actually shows the women ultimately deciding how their men will live - and with whom.Overall, a wonderful, enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this film for the first time a few months ago. I laughed harder than I remember laughing at anything made in the last twenty years. The Women is brilliantly written, brilliantly acted, and a whole lot of fun! Norma Shearer is such a sympathetic Mrs. Haines, and the "Jungle red" scene had me in laughing fits. I just could not stop the video for anything. Rosalind Russell was so funny! I thought the scene in the exercise room was absolutely hysterical. I've always been a fan of the demeure Joan Fontaine of Rebecca, and I was surprised to see her here, though not surprised that she played the lamb! This film is such a delight. I think anyone of any age would enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie has one of the best casts ever - Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Paulette Goddard, Rosalind Russell, Mary Boland, Joan Fontaine, Hedda Hopper and Virginia Weilder just to make a few. These women carry the movie perfectly and acting is perfection. Some people disagree and say that Norma Shearer acts in a 'silent screen' type of way - but I cannot agree with that. I think she did an excellent job especially when she had the crying scene on the sofa (I don't think I have ever seen anybody cry that well before).Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) discovers that her husband is having an affair with money-hungry perfume sales girl Chrystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Aided and abetted by her cousin Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) and her army of girlfriends, Mary sets out to win back her man...and teach Chrystal a lesson or two in the process! The movie runs at a rapid pace, and never leaves you bored. The dialog is incredibly witty, it very much surprised me. There was also physical comedy - the hilariously done (and no stunt doubles too!) cat fight between Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard. I found the fashion show a bit dragging and too long, but it was still fun looking at all the wonderful classy fashions of that era.This hilarious comedy about women and their men can appeal to people who are not necessarily fans of old movies. 'The Women' is a wonderful catty, witty, hilarious movie that can be enjoyed by many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was fitting that MGM was the studio that brought The Women to the screen. Claire Boothe Luce's play which ran on Broadway for 657 performances, was her view of the Republican ladies of Park Avenue, in whose society she fit in so well. None of those studio bosses were exactly flaming liberals, but probably the most political of all was Louis B. Mayer who served on the California Republican State Committee and had his stable of stars ready to do or die for the GOP whether they wanted to or not. Mayer was very active in the campaign to defeat Upton Sinclair for Governor of California in 1934 and put all of MGM's propaganda resources to defeat the radical Mr. Sinclair.Claire Boothe Luce knew this world well and certainly had the satirical skills to define it. But make no mistake about it, the real villain here is Joan Crawford, shop girl, working class, and I've got no doubt is a Democrat.Norma Shearer is her opposite, tasteful, refined, and unfortunately getting a little stale with age. Why would her husband now be eying Crawford at the perfume counter if not so.Due to a lot of interference by not so well meaning friends like Rosalind Russell, who does nothing but gossip about others, Shearer's marriage does break up and her husband goes off with Crawford. Norma's down, but not out.The Women has aged very well as entertainment. It's as fresh as it was when first presented on Broadway in 1936. There's always the complaint about no good parts for women being written for the female sex. Definitely not as good as the characters that Clare Boothe Luce created in this play.My favorite in the cast is Rosalind Russell. Usually cast as second leads and colorless heroines, she fought hard for the part she got her as the heroine's best friend and worst nightmare. She also fought hard to share above the title billing with Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford who had lots more seniority at MGM than Russell. In her memoirs Russell gives total credit to George Cukor for bringing out comedic talents that no one really thought she possessed. Russell had done comedy before, but had not been as well received as she was in The Women.George Cukor always had that reputation as a women's director and I think this film with the obvious title probably is what gave him that reputation. The Women takes a lot of its edge also from the real life situation at MGM. Norma Shearer, being the widow of Irving Thalberg, was the dowager queen of the lot and she still got the first pick of dramatic parts. Only Greta Garbo at MGM who was in a different plane of existence practically topped her. The rest got Shearer's leavings, especially Joan Crawford. That led to a lot of resentment around MGM.Among the supporting cast look for good performances from Joan Fontaine as the young and shy divorcée, Mary Boland as the scatterbrained Zsa Zsa Gabor of the day, Paulette Goddard who gets Russell's goat, her man, and the best of her in a chick fight and Marjorie Main as the wisecracking owner of a Reno dude ranch where the women stay when they're shedding their mates.Within two years Norma Shearer would retire from the screen and Joan Crawford in four years would leave MGM. This was the last really good film either of them did at Leo the Lion's den and it's fabulous.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is two wonderful hours of gossipy, clever fun. The script is incredibly good and makes you wish every movie in the world could turn out as well as THE WOMEN. The performances all blend together perfectly, which is what you need if you are going to tell a story like this. Joan Crawford is sublime as the husband stealer and Norma Shearer plays the usual virtuous kind of part she always played in her career. However in my opinion, Roz Russell, who played Mrs. Fowler simply is at her best. It is one of the most funny and exquisite performances that i have ever seen given by an actress on film. It is plain to see she only cares about herself and her own superficial motives but you cant help being on her side and enjoying all the trouble she stirs up. And also Paulette Goddard gave a sassy performance as the sarcastic woman who has seen it all and wants no more of it. The best scene of hers is when she and Mrs. Fowler fight at the divorce ranch. I loved this movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is absolutely one of the best movies of the era. It is such a fun movie to watch over and over. A classic chick flick!And, most remarkable in that there are no male actors in the movie -- yet you feel their presence throughout.The young Joan Crawford is perfectly cast as the gold digging "other woman." Norma Shearer, while not a beauty in any sense of the word, does a fine job as the beleaguered wife. Though I think it might have been better cast with someone lovelier in the lead role.But it is Rosalind Russell though who absolutely steals the movie. She is delightful to watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You could never recreate this cast on the stage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the best films of the 1930's and one of the greatest comedies ever made. This typically uncinematic George Cukor movie may possibly be the very pinnacle of his work on screen because he had the intelligence to film it straight knowing the material and the cast would speak for themselves. And the cast is to die for. You could never recreate it on stage, (even Norma Shearer is wonderful in this one). It may be very un-pc but there are few films that capture that uber-bitch mentality of upper-crust New York society dames and their gold-digging counterparts better than this. It is the zenith of the all the smart-assed, hard-boiled women's pictures of the thirties.Adapted by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from Clare Booth Luce's hit play it's about how 'Mrs Stephen Haines', (Shearer at her very best), loses her husband to Crystal Allen, (Joan Crawford before she went all serious on us), with more than a little help from her so-called 'friends', in particular catty Rosalind Russell, (terrific), before winning him back thanks to some new-found friends, (Paulette Goddard and Mary Boland among them). Men are conspicuous by their absence and it's to everyone's credit that you never miss them. A joy from start to finish.</fullReview>

It is said that the casting was so particular for this movie that everyone in Hollywood wanted to be involved with it! As Rosalind Russell even joked "everyone down to Lassie had a screen test!" Even Rosalind Russell had to prove that she was perfect for her role because the studio felt that she wouldn't make a good comedy actress! She sure showed them! Now team the comedic Roz up with the seductress Joan Crawford against the sweet Norma Shearer and watch out! As if the cast isn't enough, throw in the funny Paulette Goddard and you have a very exciting hour and a half!

		<fullReview>It's not exaggerating to say this is one of the wittiest, smartest and glamorous films ever made. Almost every line is an absolute gem, and every time you watch it, you hear another brilliant comment that you missed before.Crawford was in her wickedest prime. It could be said she's a tiny bit too old for the part, but it doesn't matter due to her force of presence. Shearer was absolute perfection as the slightly self-righteous overly dramatic heroine who finally turns into a fighter. I still get goose pimples when she does the "... two years to grow claws, mother. JUNGLE red!" line. As for Russell - she's an absolute scream in her fast-talking, slapstick role.None of the three leads steal the film from the others, as the time which they are on-screen together is limited. The supporting cast is just as fantastic - all the way down to Hedda Hopper's brief appearance at the denouement, up to Paulette Goddard, and, of course, the Countess deLave ("Oh, la publicite, la publicite!")In terms of comedy, it is unequaled, in my opinion (except perhaps for Some Like it Hot, which is very different)No remake could do it justice - let's please not have one!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Women, AKA: All the Women Rejected as Scarlett O'Hara Have it Out</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the elements in this classic are sexist by today's standards, and the ending is a bit of a wash-out. But the top-notch performances and series of zingers and one-liners transcend any plot discrepancies. But overall it is the performances that make the movie. Norma Shearer is engaging at first, palling around with her daughter in the yard. Unfortunately, after her husband cheats, she becomes too saccharine and nobly strong to be enjoyed in an otherwise wisecracking comedy (at least she's always fashion conscious: during one of her numerous breakdowns, she collapses on a couch that matches her plaid shirt). Joan Fontaine is an adorable parody of Shearer's soft character; she's especially ridiculous and charming in a phone call to her husband at the ranch. Joan Crawford is a little too terrifyingly mean to be convincing as a sexy temptress (her gorgeous and sassy co-worker Virginia Grey would in reality be the more obvious choice for an erring husband), but she's exuberant and energetic, a welcome contrast to Shearer's refined humility. Paulette Goddard is equally exuberant and energetic, exuding confidence and assurance in every line she utters. She's a foxy little charmer. Mary Boland is hilarious and giggly, though her "l'amour, l'amour" lines get a little old. Marjorie Main's appearance is all too brief, her salty ranch-owner a welcome change of pace from the more sophisticated lodgers.The most triumphant turn comes from Rosalind Russell as the "high-sterical" Sylvia Fowler. It's as if an escapee from an insane asylum were masquerading as a high-society wife, turning her charade into a mad burlesque. She's wonderful. Her tall, slouchy, slinky frame is so perfect for the role, and I can't recall having ever seen anything funnier than her cat fight with Goddard and its after-math. You can tell you're watching an under-appreciated genius at work when in a frenzy she destroys various dishes and pitchers while yelling, "I hate you! I hate you! I hate everybody!" It's regretful that her motives and fate are left ambiguous while too much screen-time is devoted to Shearer's precious tears, meditating on her plight and redemption. Or her husband's redemption. Or--oh, who knows! The moral dilemma is too muddled, and neither Cukor nor the screenwriters seem to know how to resolve it. All the attention paid to this darker storyline messes up the screwball rhythm set-up by Russell and others, and it's so jarring it wrecks the movie once in awhile. It's worth these occasional transgressions, however, for some of the finest performances to come out of old Hollywood's best actresses. Not to mention the privilege of witnessing them utter such great lines as, "Well, let the story ride! No one will remember! You remember those awful things they said about What's her name before she jumped out that window? See, I can't even remember her name, so who cares?" Or the classic closer, "There's a name for you ladies, only it isn't used in high society. Outside of a kennel."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exceptional but maybe not for all tastes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 was a TERRIBLE year to release a movie and have any hopes for an Oscar. After all, GONE WITH THE WIND, GOODBY MR. CHIPS, MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON and many, many other huge profile films came out of Hollywood that year and in any other year THE WOMEN might have garnered several Oscars--such as for Writing and Best Actress and Supporting Actress. But wonderful performances by Norma Shearer, Rosalind Russell and the rest were pretty much overlooked due to a major glut in great films that year. Plus director George Cukor, who was called a "women's director" because of how he handled women and made the most of their performances lost out to Victor Fleming for GONE WITH THE WIND--even though many different directors (including Cukor) had actually worked on the film (producer David O. Selznick fired them faster than on possibly any film project in history).THE WOMEN is amazing because all the parts (even the dogs and pieces of art throughout the film) are played by females. Some ladies might love this since it is a form of giving "equal time", but others might be dismayed because many of the roles are pretty stereotypical and old-fashioned. I assume many of the more rabid feminists out there might strongly dislike the film because of this, but in its context it's a fine film. The only part I thought was pretty lame was the very beginning where it showed the actresses one-by-one and then had them turn into animals meant to symbolize their personalities. This seemed pretty heavy-handed and kind of silly. Also, there are probably some guys who simply will dismiss the film because it's a "chick movie"--but this is a mistake because anyone with an open mind can enjoy this movie.The film is presented in three segments. The first centers on Norma Shearer's marriage and her many friends and so-called friends. It seems that everyone but Shearer knows that her husband is cheating on her with bimbo, Joan Crawford. Through most of this segment, Shearer is happy and oblivious. When she discovers the truth (and this was handled very well in the film), she is torn--she loves her husband but keeps getting barraged by messages from everyone. Her mother, ably played by Lucille Watson (in a less domineering part than is typical for her) advises Shearer to pretend nothing is happening and it will all blow over--a view that seems to be what the film is trying to tell women! This really was annoying. It seemed to say that infidelity was inevitable and women should just mind their own business!! Despite this old fashioned idea, the rest of Shearer's friends and so-called friends also have a variety of opinions and some push her to get a divorce, some push her to ignore it and some push her to confront the "evil tramp" that is breaking up the marriage. Oddly, no one seemed to blame the man--as if ALL men are salivating pigs who can be led anywhere by a conniving tramp. UGGGH! I hated this message, but could look past it because this WAS the 1930s and because the film was brilliant in how it portrayed those who seemed to love Shearer's plight--despite the fact she was a nice and decent person. In particular, Rosalind Russell was wonderfully cast as a viper of a woman who did everything to spread gossip and make the problem explode.In the second segment, Shearer leaves for Reno to get a divorce. Here she is escorted by her sweet friend, Joan Fontaine, and she meets a lot of new friends while staying at a ranch/rooming house run by the always funny Marjorie Main. This section mostly is about women's solidarity and comradeship. All this is deflated, somewhat, when Ms. Russell shows up--as her husband just left her (a smart move based on what we've seen of her).The third section takes place over a couple years. Joan Crawford is now married to Norma's ex-husband and life is NOT as wonderful for this new family as you might have expected. This is due to the fact that Shearer and her ex really cared for each other AND because Crawfor turned out to be a selfish pig. And, not surprisingly, her new best-friend is Rosalind Russell--who has, thankfully, drifted away from Shearer. What follows is very, very enjoyable--with Shearer deciding maybe she wants her old husband back but not until she hatches a plan. How this all comes together in the end is GREAT and well worth seeing.Despite some complaints above, the humorous and ironic script and the exceptional acting of dozens and dozens of great MGM contract actresses make this a must-see film for old movie buffs. According to IMDb, all the contract women at MGM were in the film apart from Greta Garbo and Myrna Loy. If you look close during the dressing room scene, you can even see Blossum Rock--that's "Grandmama" from the ADDAMS FAMILY and the older sister of Jeanette MacDonald.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is a fast paced, witty and amusing "Chick Flick" Very forward thinking for its time and the relations and gossip within the women is timeless (still true to todays "Women") I thoroughly enjoyed this film from its dialogue, character development, story, cinematography. The fashion show is a must see as you will notice the old styles still have influence today. Although this is obviously not a story of average women (this movie is set in high society New York) it is interesting to see the Salon and the subtle lavishness Fifth avenue shopping. Also it was a nice touch that the men in this movie were just implied and talked about and not shown.I enjoyed this movie more than the types of films out there now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every woman's worst enemy is another woman- often her best friend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been plenty of films with an all-male, or almost all-male, cast, but films with an all-female cast are much rarer; in the thirties they were virtually unheard-of. There were, of course, plenty of what were called "women's pictures", aimed at a predominantly female audience and generally with a strong female character in the leading role, but as the theme of such films was normally heterosexual love and relationships there generally had to be men in the cast, if only as secondary characters. "The Women", however, is a "woman's picture" in which man are much discussed but never make an appearance; every single member of the cast is female. Today we tend to think of the Production Code era as being a time when the film industry was dominated by a crippling and oppressive Puritanism, but films like this one remind us that, in America at least, the censors were not as puritanical as we sometimes imagine. I cannot imagine this arch, knowing comedy about divorce and adultery finding favour with the British censors of the thirties, but the Hays Office appear to have raised no objections. &nbsp;The film is set among the women of New York's high society. The main character is Mary Haines, wife of a successful engineer and mother of a young daughter. Mary's marriage initially seems to be a happy one, but in fact her husband Stephen is having an affair with a shop-girl named Crystal Allen. They say that in cases like this the wronged wife is always the last person to know, and so it proves here, but the time-lag between the rest of the world knowing and Mary knowing herself is a fairly short one, largely because she has the sort of "friends" who (in the words of the song) can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door. Despite the advice of her worldly-wise old mother, who takes the view that women ought to condone their husbands' adultery for the sake of a quiet life, Mary travels to Reno, Nevada, to obtain a divorce. (In the 1930s it was very difficult to get a divorce in New York State itself which, despite being liberal in many other matters, has always been conservative when it comes to matrimonial law; it was the last state to legalise no-fault divorce, as recently as 2010). Stephen marries Crystal, but the marriage is not a happy one and Mary sees her chance to turn the tables on her rival. The role of Mary- the noble, idealistic, long-suffering wronged wife, not unattractive but a bit sexless- seemed ready-made for Norma Shearer, who seemed to specialise in&nbsp;such parts. Joan Crawford tries to make the most of the mercenary, conniving Crystal, but she was really a bit too old for the part. Crawford tended to guard her age as though it were an official secret, but she seems to have been born around 1904, making her about 35 in 1939, only two years or so younger than Shearer. The age-gap between Mary and&nbsp;Crystal needs to be much greater; a dedicated gold- digger like Crystal would doubtless have got her man long before she reached her mid-thirties. When the film was remade in 1956 as "The Opposite Sex" Crystal was played by another "Joan C", Collins, sixteen years younger than June Allyson who played the Mary-figure. "The Women"&nbsp;is often regarded as a great classic from Hollywood's Golden Age, but it is not a film I care for very much. It has some good points; there is occasionally some witty dialogue, Shearer is reasonably good as Mary and the child star Virginia Weidler is enchanting as her young daughter Little Mary. It also, however, has a number of faults. The first is that the decision not to have any male characters was a mistaken gimmick; the makers of "The Opposite Sex" clearly realised this because they altered the plot in order to show Stephen and some of the other men referred to. The mainspring of the plot is, after all, the marriage of Mary and Stephen, and to show only one side of their relationship is to tell only half the story. The second flaw is that the action does not always flow easily. The film is in&nbsp;black-and-white but includes a ten-minute fashion parade filmed in&nbsp;Technicolor, which does not advance the plot at all but slows the action right down. Apparently director George Cukor disliked the sequence and wanted to remove it but was overruled by&nbsp;the studio who evidently felt that female audiences would want to see what the well- dressed woman was wearing that year. Today it has little interest except for the few who care about what the well-dressed woman was wearing more than seventy years ago. At other times, however, it seems that Cukor, perhaps realising that the script contained too much dialogue to be accommodated within the film's running time, had instructed his cast to speak their lines as quickly as possible. The worst, although by no means the only, offender in this regard is the motormouth Rosalind Russell as Mary's bitchy cousin Sylvia. (Russell was to be better in another comedy, "His Girl Friday", the following year). The film's third, and worst, fault is its general tone. For what is ostensibly a "woman's picture" it is surprisingly misogynistic, embodying a number of male prejudices about the fairer sex. The characters in "The Women"&nbsp;inhabit the sort of world where nearly all women (Mary being one of the few exceptions) are spiteful, scheming, bitchy, gossipy and&nbsp;backstabbing. It is a world where every woman's enemy is another woman, often her so-called "best friend", who is either trying to seduce away her man or spreading malicious gossip about her. If there is a "war of the sexes" the female authors of this drama seem to have been fighting on the side of the enemy. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "other women" of THE WOMEN...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading other user comments for this film, I will admit that a good many viewers saw this movie as I did: a raucous free-for-all with memorable quotes, scenes, and personalities. I do, however, wish to expand upon a couple of reasonably untouched areas for commentary...the understated, underrated performances in the film, namely Joan Fontaine's portrayal of Peggy Day and Lucille Watson's Mrs. Moorehead.One viewer commented that Fontaine's "Peggy" was, at times, along the lines of "mentally retarded" (other user's words, NOT mine). While everyone is entitled his own opinion, I assert that the complete point of the Peggy character can be lost in the mix of bigger, brasher characters and stars in the film. In every group of female friends, there is a "Peggy"... the naive, doe-eyed woman who is unsure and uncertain and tends to seek the counsel and affirmation of her older, wiser, more experienced friends. When it comes down to it, Peggy is a young woman, newly married, and dealing with the pressures of maintaining a Park Avenue life on a tight budget (at least by the standards of her friends!!). She is timid and unsure, and she finds solace and security in her older friends. This is incredibly normal where female relationships are concerned. So, while Fontaine's performance may seem, at times, to be a little over-dramatic, remember that the whole movie is over the top. That's part of what makes it so fun. The character of Peggy merely adds a little sincerity and innocence to a plot full of back-stabbing and lost youth.Peggy's polar opposite, "Mrs. Moorehead," is yet another understated character and performance (played by Lucile Watson). This woman is the mother of the wise Mary Haines, and serves as Mary's sounding board. She offers advice to her daughter and dispatches sarcastic one-liners off the cuff that rival even many of Roz Russell and Paulette Goddard's best lines. She also pulls no punches with her honesty, whether you agree with her or not. Her comments about "those dreadful women" and her "fumigating" scene are particularly humorous. Keep an eye on her character, and I assure you the movie will be that much better!! This movie, maybe more than any other I have seen, depends on the presence of all of the characters to a large degree. No one in this film is there on accident...they each have a very specific purpose in the plot. Allowing oneself to really appreciate the lesser characters can only serve to make to viewing experience more enjoyable each time.</fullReview>

Most surprising is the comedic performance turned in by Joan Crawford as the man stealing/man eating Crystal Allen. Perfectly cast, she had a flair for spewing out one liner's like no one else. Most surprisingly was the fact that for being made in 1939, the majority of the material is stylish and sophisticated, along with the one liners that still hold up today (not including the fashion show scene, where did those clothes come from?). Every time I see this film, I always pick up something new, and realize how many talented actresses there were way back then as opposed to today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As has been said before 1939 was a great year for Hollywood classics, "Gone with the Wind", "The Wizard of Oz", "Wuthering Heights", "Stagecoach", et.al but I must admit I'd never heard of this film, or its place in the pantheon before now. It merits its spot. Once the novelty of an all-female cast wears off (there' nary a male extra in the backgrounds either), the movie crackles along as a small group of society women present a kaleidoscopic view of relations with men so that while men are absent physically they're ever-present in the dialogue and thoughts of this contrasting set of women-folk. Introduced wittily over the titles alongside their attributional equivalents in the animal world, the actresses play out of their skins and make a two hour plus set-bound movie simply fly by. Central to the whole is Norma Shearer, whose perfect marriage is shattered by her husband's casual infidelity with on-the-make shop girl Joan Crawford in a terrific, venomous turn. Shearer effectively plays queen bee to the drones around her both in her society set and in the motley assemblage at the divorce farm in Reno. She makes the journey from marriage to divorce and back with dignity and intelligence and even if I personally disagree with her choice and the sickly schmaltzy close-up with which she ends the film, about to fall back into her errant (ex-) husband's arms, this doesn't invalidate the fun and wit that has gone before. As good as Crawford and Shearer are, in their contrasting roles, it's Rosalind Russell as the treacherous, waspish Mrs Fowler, who steals the show and gets many of the best situations (her cat fight with Goddard is priceless!) and lines. Goddard too is radiant and knowing in her part, while a young Joan Fontaine simpers pleasantly as the naive "little child" of the group. A special nod also to the child actress playing Shearer's daughter without artifice and yet with appreciable warmth and naturalness. There are one or two anachronistic moments which jar, reflecting contemporary attitudes towards race and censorship, but on the whole, "woman's director" George Cukor keeps all the ingredients close to or at boiling point throughout. Perhaps too many of the speeches are head and shoulder shots fore square to the camera and having got good play out of two servant staff extemporising the doings of their masters, Cukor makes the mistake of repeating the trick immediately afterwards, thus diminishing the comedic impact. Nevertheless, appreciating that some of these criticisms are merely due to a retrospective eye (obviously cinematic times and styles change) on a film which in some respects is dated, there are still some neat turns in the language and phrases used, which still resonate today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of those movies that serves as a social sensibilities milepost for its era, and as such, carries far greater import than your run of the mill "late late show". The touchy subjects of infidelity and divorce are tackled from an intelligent point of view, rather than the usual fluffy 'romance conquers all' silliness more common to movies, then and now. What makes this film stand up, however, is the startling ensemble of big ticket leading ladies, who are each more captivating than the next. I have to laugh when I see this is being remade with todays sadly inadequate female leads, Aneete Benning, Meg Ryan, etc...and that the direction is to be handled by a woman, LOL. A 5 year old can see that the original film's success was largely a result of director Cukor's male adoration approach to the camera-work, a peak into the forbidden world of women, a la Degas. Take that away in this instance, and I fear you row helplessly towards the maelstrom known all too familiarly as REMAKE DRECK CITY. Aren't we all just completely sick of that journey? Hope I'm wrong, but if I'm not, the original will endure nonetheless for it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is one of those rare films where I am literally grinning throughout. Not only because it's darn funny and incredibly witty, but it's just amazing to see so many female screen legends on the same screen at once. One of my many complaints about the films of today is that there are so few choice roles for women, 2000 being a rare exception. And this film has four great female roles and a number of good supporting roles. How George Cukor kept his wits about him during the filming of The Women with so much estrogen about him is beyond me. Yes, the film, especially the ending, may be slightly offensive to today's "modern woman". But somehow, it's uplifting because we know that Norma Shearer's character is getting what she wants. And it's an interesting, and almost shocking, statement about society then and now that she's so willing to take him back after what he's done. On top of it all, you have one of the ultimate examples of good (Shearer) triumphing over evil (Joan Crawford). Plus, like all great classic films, there is a brilliant supporting cast that provides even more laughs and never a dull moment. "L'amour, l'amour!"I know 1939 was a particularly competitive year, but this film was really snubbed for Oscar noms. Why don't we go back and take away the best picture nom from the excrutiatingly witless Love Affair, a director's nom away from Sam Wood (no offense, Sam, but Mr Chips was all about performances), bump Greer Garson down to a supporting nom for Mr Chips so Norma can have a best actress nom, and drop Maria Ouspenskaya and make room for Joan Crawford. That's not asking too much, is it?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not one for films with a comical sense to them, but this is another film I've found to enjoy mainly due to its comical moments, if the film focused entirely on the drama at hand, it would much less well received, but otherwise it is a great film. Following the inter-twined plots of multiple women going to be divorced, they conflict, talk, learn, and change. A colorful cast keeps the movie lively with some lovely ladies leading the line, (there's an alliteration for ya) and keeping it interesting the whole time. A great example of being able to mix a lighter tone with something much more deep. The film touches on the numerous issues that are brought along with any relationship, whether they'd be small or the extremes, and emphasizes them without completely ruining the rest of the film's mood, this is a result of competent script writing, well thought out execution of each scene by the actors, and the well regarded cinematography from the era, looking for a good laugh that makes you think?

		<fullReview>A TCM announcer said the classic cat fight of all times was in this movie. It is a humdinger. But it doesn't start at the ranch -- it runs all the way through!So much has been noted about it, but wanted to comment on something about the Joan Crawford character. She works at a sales counter, yet has a nice place of her own and great clothes. She played a lot of shop girls, always having a knockout wardrobe, including over the top evening clothes and a very well appointed apartment. In the real world, a sales girl would have to be living at home or at the Y or have at least one roommate, and wouldn't be able to afford an expensive wardrobe. But, this is the movies, and we enjoy it that way. Also, really enjoyed Virginia Grey's part as the savvy sales girl who prickles Crystal while she's on the phone with Steven. "Holy mackerel, what a line!" With so much cleverness going on, that sequence doesn't get much mention, but she was priceless. How about that beauty clinic! What a setup. And we do love to admire the clothes, which were so interesting then, their dressing up so much. There's a lot to check out in this picture, as well as catching the snappy lines, as has been mentioned here. Yep, play it again, Sam-antha.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seeing How The Other Half Lives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's funny to read people arguing "The Women" is a flawed movie because it no longer speaks to who or what women are today. Does the same metric apply to "The Scarlet Letter" or "Anna Karenina"? Of course not. They are timeless classics. So is "The Women".The setting is Manhattan, at a time when women enjoyed some newly acquired independence but still had to find their way in a world built by and for men. Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) treasures the company of her loving husband, but the wool is rather roughly pulled from her eyes and she is left to discover he's been stepping out with shopgirl Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford).What makes "The Women" great? Having an entire film with no male characters is a cool trick, but doesn't guarantee re-watchability. What clicks starts with a zesty, witty script, written by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from a Claire Booth play. It doesn't conceal the hurt of marital separation so much as send up the associated entanglements stirred up by an idle, jealous set that holds court over Mary's world.At its vortex, more essential to the comedy's success than either Crawford or Shearer, is Rosalind Russell's performance as Mary's conniving cousin Sylvia Fowler. She shouldn't be so enjoyable, but she is. When you think of it, Sylvia's by far the nastiest character in the film. At least Crystal has a profit motive. "You can't bear Mary's happiness" is how one bystander puts it to Sylvia, and she's right.Russell's ability to seize the comic high ground throughout, mugging up a storm, taking pratfalls, and even biting Paulette Goddard's calf, goes a large way to making "The Women" such a blast. Russell's as much fun as Olivier was playing Richard III, twisting Mary into a pointless confrontation with Crystal with her cruel dig: "No doubt that girl will make a perfectly good stepmom for your daughter." But just try hating Sylvia. You can't!I relish the whole cast. It's quite a large one, Dickens-like not only in mass but in the number of distinctive characterizations. It's not an especially deep story, though there are emotional resonances and points worth discussing and debating. That goes especially for Mary's parleys with her mother (Lucile Watson), who tells her to ignore hubby's affair and "keep still". The mother wishes times were simpler, and women didn't have the option of not tolerating a husband's infidelity. You can question the rationale, but their scenes have impact.Shearer has the toughest job in the film playing the good-hearted victim. She's not as self-conscious there as her critics say; she's limited not by her talent but by the script. She can't even play it too naive as Joan Fontaine has that territory sewn up as Mary's gentlest friend. So Shearer works it down the middle, milks some tears, and hangs around long enough to deliver the film's greatest line, one you know already if you've seen it. And she nails it...purrfectly.Crawford is surprisingly absent for much of the film, given she has second billing. She does make every scene she's in count. Mary Boland is a wonderfully affected older woman married and dropped by a parade of husbands - including one who pushed her off a mountain. Even Goddard, more pretty than talented in roles I've seen of hers, crafts an effective identity as a Crystal-like character who winds up one of Mary Haines' sisters-in-arms.The more I see "The Women", the tougher time I have identifying anything really not good about it. Even a lengthy fashion show, a segment that was shot in Technicolor and which director George Cukor is on record regretting, doesn't feel off-the-beam. I love watching Russell in her glasses knitting and pretending not to be bothered by the pretty models she believes are competing for her husband's attention.There's just a lot to see and enjoy with "The Women". What can I say? I'm a guy. I suspect any woman giving this half a chance will have even more fun than I did.</fullReview>

I Love the countess, who has been married numerous times, but still enjoys the challenge of finally finding the right one! Toujour L'amour! Very LONG movie, but it's fun to watch the Dynasty-type catfights, although they don't roll around on the floor . (and the irony of Joan Crawford making little Mary call her "auntie crystal"...much like "mommie dearest" in real life...) Hedda Hopper, Norma Shearer, Paulette Goddard. it's Norma versus Joan, and it's all-out war in high society!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is amazing and should be viewed more often. It has one of the best Scripts, Casts &amp; Costumes I have seen. Although it is dated, it is a great study at how things were and how things have/haven't changed. I bought it 4 years ago just because of Joan Crawford and grew to love everyone in it. I also became interested in finding everything with Norma Shearer in it. I love the line, "What's the matter, she's got a hangover?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...opposite corners, come out claws unsheathed, teeth bared, and wits sharpened.It must have been difficult to make this movie and keep it balanced without the cast trying to upstage each other all the time. However, everybody is given the perfect opportunity to shine; you even (kind of) feel sorry for Joan Crawford at the end when she's received her come-uppance (but you still can't resist the urge to point at her and go "neener neener neener, ha, ha, you lost!") Norma Shearer starts out a little slowly, but that's only part of her character.One of those perfectly cast films you'd hate to see remade. (Should also be required viewing for women's studies classes as an historical record on how women's identities have changed over the years.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>MGM Had more stars than in the heavens and with this film it clearly had more female stars than in the heavens. Funny, fast and classic comedy with a gaggle of female stars either on the rise or decline. Norma and Joan (Shearer and Crawford) were on their way out of MGM but both give well mannered and watchale performances. Roz Russell, Joan Fontaine, and Paulette Goddard were rising stars and all play their parts to perfection. The sets, clothing, music were all top notch what one would expect from an MGM A production. Somehow this film has gotten lost when one talks about the classics of 1939, but IMO The Women is far more watchable than say Gone With the Wind, or Goodbye Mister Chips released the same year. Grab your popcorn and a cold coke and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a fabulous movie! It really is true that you just don't find dialogue like this anymore, with so many great one-liners, monologues, and dialogues that it could keep a whole bus full of queens busy for a year! Add to all that the million megawatt star-power unleashed and Cukor's superb directing, and you have a sure-fire hit on your hands. My only beef is that this movie isn't offered in DVD anywhere, which is a real crying shame considering its importance as the first movie in which color was used and just how plain wonderful it is. Of all the movies in the world - this one should be on DVD. And so should "Beautiful Thing", but that's another matter....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm guessing you'll go a long way to find a negative opinion of this minor classic which tended to get lost in the shuffle on its initial release due to the fact that as we all know 1939 was a vintage year for Hollywood movies. Be that as it may it had hardly dated when I caught up with it at the NFT, the thick end of 70 years after the initial release; true, Roz Russell now seems a tad mannered/OTT but at the time it probably seemed quite normal; using the same criteria Norma Shearer now seems like a carry-over from the Silents but again was probably perfectly acceptable at the time. What survives intact is the great script punctuated with acidic one-liners and toppers such as when the novelist in the group allows that she should perhaps ask Roz Russell for help with her plots, 'you should ask someone' retorts Russell and the strength of the movie is that this is thrown away whereas a director other than Cukor may well have paused for a laugh instead of hurtling on with the action. There's a fine blend of ingenu'e versus alley-cat with all shades in between; in short, a terrific vintage movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lovers of glamorous bitch fests will have the time of their lives with this gem from 1939.MGM's best female talent were assembled for this catty story about females good and bad, and all of the conniving, backstabbing, hissing and scratching that ensues whenever you have a group of ladies together at one time. Of course it's all exaggerated, and even fairly retrograde by today's standards, but I encourage everyone to muffle those feminist sensibilities for two hours and allow yourselves to have fun here.Norma Shearer plays the goody-goody heroine, Joan Crawford plays the deliciously malevolent villainess, and Rosalind Russell steals every scene she's in as a brassy society lady with far too much time on her hands. George Cukor was directing at the height of his talents, and keeps things snappy and smart. A treasure to relish from one of Hollywood's golden years.Grade: A</fullReview>

Believe me, I've complained directly to Netflix several times. If readers of this posting who are also Netflix members would put "The Women" in their queue, perhaps the increased demand would stimulate Netflix to do the right thing and carry a movie of this caliber.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would almost be worth watching just to see how the experiment with an all-female cast works out, but besides being unique, "The Women" is also an entertaining movie that features a strong cast. Most of the time, it seems perfectly natural, so that the lack of any men is not even noticeable, and in itself that's a pretty good sign that it has worked. The cast has a lot to do with that, as there are many good performances that make the characters believable and interesting.The story builds up nicely as it ties together the situations of several different characters, creating numerous parallels and connections among them. Norma Shearer gives a fine performance as the wife at the center of most of the events, and there are almost too many good supporting performances to list. Given the rather soapy nature of the material, the story is surprisingly interesting. The writing and the actresses make it all work with barely any hitches. Although most of the characters are not particularly imaginative in themselves, the script makes each of them well-defined, and most of the actresses are nicely matched with their roles.The end product is a credit to the cast, the director, and the writers alike.</fullReview>

But the notable character for me in this movie is none other than Rosalind Russell, who portrays the everso picture perfect campy vixen wannabe, Sylvia Fowler, out to tell all about her high society friends. We all have a friend in our lives like Sylvia - its no wonder why we love her so. Practically all the characters are likable in some fashion making this nonstop comedy a 5 star must see!

Norma Shearer is perfect as Mary Haines, and Joan Crawford is a wonderfully devious Crystal. Although the cast was all-female, much of the plot revolves around the women's relationships with the men in their lives. Through this, director George Cukor is able to create a film which pokes fun at the frivolities of rich housewives while simultaneously criticizing the society that created these frivolities. This gives an edge to the lightheartedness of the film The women in the movie are ridiculously hilarious. I especially enjoyed the character of Sylvia Fowler, portrayed by Rosalind Russell; her actions are so ridiculous that one can't help but laugh at them. The snappy dialogue between the characters combined with a fun plot made this an overall enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

It is directed by George Cukor and stars Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, and Norma Shearer. These women on a hunt for a speedy divorce are full of gossip and betrayal much like the men they court with. what is so great about this film is that is all women a complete cast of just women it makes the style of the film femininely authentic and certainly unique from anything I've seen. there is a constant talk of men....however, no men!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a rather interesting drama. The filming was clever in that no men were present on screen, which really allows you to focus on the interactions between the women. The film itself highlights the drama surrounding female stereotypes and the complexities of affairs and divorce. It's great to see a movie comprised of an all female cast, even though they are associated with some rather negative stereotypes. The drama is built nicely by all of these women's paths crossing one another's at some point, and the issues soon become everyone's problem. Overall this film was a decent drama, with rather progressive casting for the times, and would have been even more impressive if it was directed by a woman as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movies are always about different things, whether it be romance or monsters or gangsters or cowboys and indians, but they usually always have male and female protagonists or antagonists. However, in this tale of socialites, there is not ONE male in the entire movie. Even the animals are female! The only time men are within this film, are when the women are talking about them. It was truly a unique thing that I had never seen done in movies before. All the actresses did an amazing job, and were fun to watch. Even Joan Crawford was a character that you loved to dislike. The most enjoyable part of watching this movie for me, was watching it with my 78 year old father. This is one of his FAVORITE films, and the look of joy on his face when I suggested watching it together was priceless. And again, despite there not being a single male in this film, it was great to see that people of all ages could enjoy and appreciate the uniqueness of these strong, talented, and lovely leading ladies.</fullReview>

Also at the time I am sure an affair was much less common. The title alone is incredible since the movie is all about gossip and women are notoriously associated with it. It really does associate woman with a lot of negative stereotypes. The movie has great irony when it shows crystal who is now married to Mary's ex husband is cheating again.

		<fullReview>After choosing George Cukor's "The Women" I was skeptical of its premise at first. I became quickly surprised at how often I found myself enjoying each catty scene or insult along with the characters' prima donna behavior. The story was two hours of hilarious female innuendo's and clever insults along with a deeper story between Mary, her daughter, and the familiar intricacies of divorce. The cast was perfect in their roles, each one bringing their own flair to the script. The all-female cast molded well gabbing amongst one another in a relentless barrage of gossip. I enjoyed this movie much more than I thought and I especially liked the end scene where all the women go at it. I recommend this movie to anybody who enjoys the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this comedic drama, the main characters quickly discover that it indeed is a small world after all. It originally starts out with two ladies, Sylvia and Edith, telling Mary that her husband is having an affair with a woman named Crystal. When Mary travels to Reno to get a divorce, she meets two other ladies that just so happen to be having an affair with Sylvia's husband. Then the Countess, one of the ladies having an affair with Sylvia's husband, wants to find another man that she would rather be with. Even though the Countess doesn't want to continue anything else with Sylvia's husband, Sylvia decides that staying with her husband isn't the right idea. In the end, Mary ends up trying to win her husband back after discovering that he isn't happy with the woman he was having an affair with. This movie is all about the crazy coincidences that happen to the married women.</fullReview>

I found it clever how they worked the script without the use of any male actors. I should say this is a good film, but the content and emotion doesn't attract to me specially. Classic film.

Which I honestly like because the story is about Mary and her trying to figure out more about her own husband. Which the audience will certainly want to know more about. The acting is so well done and each character has a certain charm about them that makes them each unique.

After this film, the director, Cukor, was said to be a women's director, because he was able to bring out so much potential in the women he worked with. He also preferred working with women, a bonus for him. The story of the movie is spectacular. All these women, involved with and affecting one another.

		<shortDescription>The Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie (though often a sort of caricature of women) is the only one I had heard of, of its kind. The idea of a movie starring only women as long ago as 1939 was exciting, and even though The Women features cat-fight after stereotypical cat-fight, it exceeded my expectations in many ways.The elephant in the room when it comes to discussing The Women is the gorgeous color fashion-show sequence. It was such a change of pace from the constant snappy dialogue, and the burst of color was nothing short of shocking, but that isn't to say the sequence was jarring (maybe a little lengthy, but one can see why they'd spring for such an extravagant sequence). The garments and movement were fully utilized by adding color to that sequence.Light effects ran rampant through this movie, full of three-point-lighting close-ups on many of the main actresses. In addition to this, many of the featured gowns, accessories, and set pieces involved dazzling metallics, gem- or rhinestones, mirrors, and glass to constantly play with light throughout the film.The sets cannot only be mentioned when it comes to light, either. The sets used on The Women (the salon and boutique come most readily to mind) were beautiful. In the salon, for example, statement pieces like a hand fountain sculpture stand out and give the environment the leading women operate in an air of opulence. Venues like the boutique allow for interesting camera work. The cinematography in Mary's (Norma Shearer) dressing room during the scene when Sylvia (Rosalind Russell) convinces her to confront Crystal (Joan Crawford) across the hall was some of my favorite work in the film. The camera follows Mary to the mirror and around the room, with Sylvia in the background, her expression only visible to the audience through the mirror. It's a scene that sets a standard for expertly made film.In short, I don't know why I had never heard of The Women before. The pacing is great, the technical aspects are solid (and in many ways, extraordinary), and the film doesn't *feel* all that old, once you get back some archaic women vs men thinking. All in all, a really great and enjoyable film that's interesting to look at from a modern perspective (especially a modern woman's).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women was released in 1939 and was directed by George Cukor. The film had a good story and plot, but was just a tad too long. Mary Haines was played by Norma Shearer who is the most level headed character in the whole film besides her young daughter. Unfortunately it is the kind, respectable Mrs. Haines who has her world fall apart. Her nutty friends make the movie feel more like a screwball comedy than a drama, but there is certainly a lot of drama too. The movie has substance and it is easy to connect with Mrs. Haines as she embarks on her troublesome journey. The sets are beautifully done and add much visual appeal to the film. The fashion show scene done in color is truly memorable and distracts from the main theme of the film, but does make it a more artistic experience. The costumes were well done and I don't think Sylvia's hats could have been any more ridiculous. The film was enjoyable to watch but dragged on towards the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Famed "women's director" George Cukor sure gets his fill in The Woman, a smartly written screwball by Claire Luce and adapted for the screen by Anita Loos that is totally void of men in any role. With a powerhouse cast firing on all cylinders Cukor and the girls do such a fine job you never even miss them, though along with money and high fashion they remain one of the major topics of conversation throughout.Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) is living an enviable existence of a well to do married woman without a care in thee world. A wonderful daughter, perfect husband days filled with shopping and leisure activities until one pampered afternoon a manicurist lets it slip hubby is seeing a perfume counter girl / gold digger Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). While it shakes Mary to her core, the lurid gossip inspires "friend" Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell)to amp things up and rather than attempt reconciliation Mary divorces. At a ranch in Reno the women now joined by Mary Boland and Paulette Goddard to wait out divorces to marry others, in Goddard's case, Fowler's husband and the claws come out. By then Allen has hers completely in Mr. Haines with a wedding ring around one of them. Marriage however has not curtailed Crystals fortune hunter ways.One can only wonder how Cukor handled his temperamental movie queens to show he wasn't favoring the other. Luce's script crackles with sardonic wit and catty commentary that the ladies (especially Crawford and Russell)deliver with almost hisses while noble Shearer soldiers on through degrading gossip. Shearer at the center of the story is fine as the linchpin character in the film allowing the showier characters played with aplomb by Russell and Crawford to feast on her virtue and hurt, heightening their petty villainy. Midway through the already crowded field of fine female performances the film picks up three more from Marie Boland, Paulette Goddard and Marjorie Main all willing to dispense their take on life and men with acerbic resignation.There's a jarring Technicolor fashion show in this B&amp;W that makes no sense at all and while it arguable that The Women sells out with a Hollywood ending there is no denying that this unique experiment with over a hundred female speaking roles and the complete absence of men is a resounding success. It's a chick flic but men could learn plenty from it.</fullReview>

The acting is great, the dialogue is sharp and the story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. It's a canvas in which comments and criticisms on social status, beauty, divorce, jealousy, adultery, fashion and more are shaped. The film accomplishes this in such a way that it sparks a lot of thought and debate, the films story lasts long after the film is over which is why I enjoyed it. It wasn't just a comedy it was socially meaningful and I think it resonates in many ways today. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I thought this movie was pretty good!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was pretty interesting and it showed women in certain point of view from the society that the movie was filmed in. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round. I think the wide number of characters wasn't a problem, it actually made the movie better and stronger. They seemed to be comparing men and women, but yet there was not a single male in the movie. They did show women in a certain way, but they were just showing what women were like in the 1940's. The fashion show was the best scene in the movie if I could say so, it was shown in color. You knew that there was an audience for it because of the clapping,but you could not see them. You could sense tension, love and sadness in all the scenes, especially sadness when Mary told little Mary about the divorce. There was great emotion and love in this scene between the two of them, the camera seemed to focus on their faces and eyes, in that they were crying or very upset.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film focuses on the lives of Manhattan women, all interconnected, and their romantic entanglements.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was very comical, with quick and witty dialog. It was interesting to see a film from this time period that focused mainly on women as the main characters. I found it interesting how Sylvia went about trying to inform Mary about her husband's affair. Rather than telling her herself, she sets Mary up with an appointment with the same manicurist who told her about the affair. The character, Crystal came as a bit of a shock that she was completely unapologetic about the affair she was having with Mary's husband. I've noticed quite a few of the films I've viewed from this era displayed situations of infidelity quite frequently. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of Hollywood's classic films age better than others. One would have expected THE WOMEN, with its depiction of upper-class wives as basically parasites who live off their husbands (and the alimony checks after the divorce), to have faded into oblivion years ago. That it has not is a tribute to director George Cukor, writers Clare Booth Luce and Anita Loos (and some sources say an uncredited F Scott Fitzgerald, among others), and a stellar cast of the biggest female stars in MGM's galaxy.Somehow, getting past the basic premise, which should have dated badly but somehow has not, is fairly easy, mainly because this movie is just so much fun. From Rosalind Russell and Paulette Goddard's infamous cat fight at the Reno ranch to Mary's (Shearer) attempts to be oh-so-noble about her failed marriage (drawing sharp criticism from her mother, who knows better but to whom she will not listen) to Joan Fontaine's simpering little mouse to what I consider the best performance in the whole thing: Joan Crawford as the conniving, husband-stealing bitch Crystal Allen, an employee at the perfume counter at an upscale store who manages to wreck Mary's marriage and steal her husband, if only temporarily. Crawford only won one Oscar in her career, as the noble, self-sacrificing mother in MILDRED PIERCE, and her biographers have suggested that the Mildred role was how she saw herself, but I always liked her the best when she played a broad on the make, as in GRAND HOTEL and in this, possibly her best film role, and one which gave her one of the best exit lines ever written (see above).A lot has been said and written about the "sexist" nature of this film and the play upon which it was based, but Luce was writing of people she knew, and in those days a man who made or had serious money took care of his wife during their marriage and even after, so the film works, even today, I think, as a great comedy of manners that brilliantly spoofs upper class women with too much time on their hands and not enough scruples or ambition to actually DO anything themselves.I love this movie. Yes, it is sexist, and no, it could never work today (I know they remade it but I refuse to see it; the very idea is preposterous), but thanks to Cukor's skill in handling a cast that had not one man in the mix, THE WOMEN remains a classic comedy of manners with dialogue that will never go out of style.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now here's a movie that surprised me. In the Golden Age of Hollywood, most of what you see is a man's, man's, man's, man's world. Men were the detectives; women were the secretaries. Men were the explorers; women were damsels in distress. Well if you're tired of the sausage fest that is early Hollywood, here's a movie for the ladies. The Women is the first movie to have an all female cast. Literally, every character is female (maybe some of the animals were males, but I neglected to check), which is pretty groundbreaking in it's own right. Now even though it's an all female cast, the characters in this movie don't really break free of the Hollywood female stereotype; which may not please too many feminists. But to me, that's what makes this movie so fascinating. If you ask you grandmother what life for women was like in the post depression, pre WWII era, she'd probably tell you something like this movie. Yes, the women just talk about men and fashion, but like I often say, it's the 1930s; what do you expect? In this time period, American women were basically not allowed to have interesting lives. Men made money; women stayed home and counted it. I think what makes this movie really unique is that it's not really telling a story (even though it is), but rather showing the female culture of the time period. And you know what? That's really interesting. And these aren't just women, these are high society women. And the writing is so well done, that you actually care about these people who probably wouldn't even look at you. It shows that people of high social status live glamorous lives, but also very lonely lives. This is a world where everybody talks about everybody, and social status is the most important thing. I think this is exemplified perfectly when the one character says if a man divorces a woman, her reputation is destroyed. But if a woman divorces her husband, than she is well respected. It just shows how important social class was back then, and how reputations were seen as more important than love. This is just a great movie, and a great study of the culture. I love (most of) the characters, I love the story, and I even love that pointless color sequence in the middle of the movie. The only flaws I find with this movie is sometimes the dialogue moves to fast, and there are so many characters, that I found myself lost a few times watching this movie. But overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women was a very interesting film, I wasn't very sold with it at first it was hard to focus on because so many things were going on, women were busy everywhere doing strange things, and they were talking a mile a minute. When things settled down I began to realize that it was doing a fantastic job of portraying the lives of well women. I think it's funny that you don't see a man in the ENTIRE film, not even the infamous "Stephen" Mary's husband. That actually made me laugh. All the women characters were quite good, none of them compare to Mary Haines of course. I loved Mary, she was fantastic, she was a sweetheart like everyone said throughout the movie, at first she seemed like someone to feel sorry for, but then you saw how strong she was and clever, that your sympathy turned to cheery as you waited to see Mary win in the end. I think the thing about her that impressed me the most, was how good of a mother she was at all times! Over all a good film.</fullReview>

Girls can be so "catty" and this movie depicts that perfectly. But what I found most interesting? The fashion show was in color while the rest of the movie was black and white. This movie was also interesting because although it was told from a womens view on marriage and their role on society - there were no men present throughout the whole film. Only female roles. I found that really cool because it showed a new light for women. I do agree, movies from the 30s and 40s have become a soft spot for me, I really enjoyed watching.</fullReview>

Silliest of the Silly Characters is played by Rosalind Russell, an actress who was fun, witty---yet was NOT a "Sylvia Fowler Airhead".

In fact, this movie THE WOMEN helped Roz get matched with her only husband!.First, THE WOMEN was shown over &amp; over...on a boat which crossed the Atlantic...to passengers who hoped &amp; prayed the Nazis would not torpedo and sink their boat. One Danish man aboard that boat even hunted down Rosalind Russell and got his friend Cary Grant to introduce him. (THey married...had a son---and the marriage lasted till her death.)Maybe YOUR mom - dad walks just fine - because of the polio vaccine - Ms. Russell helped promote polio fighting science!!! *****To writers, playrights buy the DVD - Study the dialogue!

Cukor made the film look great. I think he did a wonderful job on the director part. The fashion show part was amazing. The colors were wonderful for a 1939 film. I think it could have been a lot more mean and nasty, but it did come out after the hays codes were in affect. I love the women's wardrobe they were beautiful. The final product was classy to me.

		<shortDescription>All about women... and their men.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of The Women surfaced last year, but I refuse to see it because I cannot imagine any of the big name actresses that were cast being as effective as those here. In fact, since the original was made under the studio system, the names are even bigger. Norma Shearer, the queen of MGM, plays Mary Haines, a wealthy socialite wife whose life is jolted awake when she finds out that her husband Stephen (whom we never see) is seeing another woman. To make matters worse, that woman is a clever and daring seductress played by Joan Crawford and she is relentless in pursuing her man. Rosalind Russell is the sharp-tongued Sylvia Fowler and these three women as well as their friends all go through some of the most incredible relationship trouble I have ever seen for a few people.What makes this movie a classic has to be the cast, but also the sharp and witty dialog that is written. Based on Claire Booth Luce's play, director George Cukor certainly stays faithful to the material, treating it as if it were a stage production, only with film he has the freedom to open up and express the full-blown experience of living in high-society New York in the 1930s. Certainly life was quite stunning back then, but their lifestyle makes their relationships all the more prominent as it is mostly due to their husbands that they live that way. In terms of plot, it does go a little too long, especially a fashion show sequence (done in color) that seemed to take forever. There is also a subplot involving Reno that seemed tacky and the ending is too conventional. Still, all shortcomings aside, to see these wonderful actresses converse and go at each other's throats is certainly worth watching and it goes to show how big names should be brought together for the sake of the film, not to advertise it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Delightful! One of Cukor's best films.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Cukor's The Women has got to be one of my favourite films. Not only is it highly enjoyable, but the lines, the acting, the clothes, and the pace of it is all perfect. I never watched the play version of it, but I sure do like this film! It was the film that introduced me to Norma Shearer and I absolutely fell in love with her. It was also my first Joan Crawford film and I found her to be an amazing actress. I have read complaints about Shearer's acting, but I thought she was really great and wasn't overacting at all. My favourite scene has got to be when she says, "I've had two years to grow claws mother. Jungle red!" It's such a shame that a once famous actress and the queen of MGM is now long forgotten.Although there are some remarks that may make modern women cringe, I thought that the overall portrayal of women was incredibly accurate. Watching these women's actions were almost looking at a mirror and I could relate to almost every character. Mary Haines (Shearer) is nobel and she sure knows how to get revenge! Sylvia Fowler (Russell) has the most outrageous clothes and hats and is the biggest blabbermouth ever. She is also someone who enjoys seeing other in pain, probably due to her not-so-great relationship with her husband. And Joan Crawford as Crystal Allen? my, my! She is fabulous and whereas Crystal is quite a? for the lack of better words, a bitch, I can sympathize to a certain extent. Actually, I wish I can be like her! She is gorgeous and knows how to fend for herself using words. Her final line, "There is a name for you, ladies, but it isn't used in high society? outside of a kennel.", is a perfect way to make an exit; while she did admit defeat, she at least got to say something nasty in a calm manner and leave in a superficially classy way.All I can really say about this film is that it is FABULOUS and a film that everyone should watch once. I have watched it multiple times and it never fails to put a smile on my face. So many of the things mentioned in this film are true to this day and it's really fun to see a glimpse into how high society women lived in those days. Seeing Rosalind Russell do all those exercises was hilarious and seeing how women got perms and facials was interesting as well.Film blog: http://sachlichkeit.net</fullReview>

Lucille Watson as Shearer's mother is wonderful, as always. Muriel Hutchinson and Mary Cecil, who didn't make ten films between the two of them (what a loss for us!) are perfect as the maid and cook commiserating over their employers' break-up. Virginia Grey, Crawford's co-worker who tries to sabotage the phone call, is so beautiful and acts her part so well--watch her in this scene instead of Crawford--that it really shows the promise she had, and which Hollywood never took the trouble to properly develop. Former stars abound--Aileen Pringle, Judith Allen, and Flora Finch who was Hollywood's very first female comedy star in the 1910's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I was dragged (by a couple of friends) up to The Regency on 67th Street. I'd never heard of it and didn't know a thing about it. But after that viewing, of course I had to have it, and promptly bought a copy. Everyone's comments are so apt, and so on target that it's really pointless to add mine, since they're basically more of the same old stuff. However, having watched the movie more times than is humanly possible, there are a few tidbits that might be amusing to other addicts.First of all, there is indeed a man in this movie. He only appears once, but he's there all right. I'm not giving this sighting away, but take a closer look at Mary's first Park Avenue luncheon scene. You know, the one where Sylvia says "And has anyone wondered if the master of this maison might not be straying?"I'm surprised no one has commented on that wonderful Dennie Moore, either. (No, not that terrible Demi). Dennie is the manicurist, Olga. She's absolutely wonderful...so contrite when the "whole ghastly story rolls out." Yes, this is more than a movie. It's a way of life. I can't think of a time (either socially or business-wise) when a line from this movie isn't an appropriate response. "Miniatures!Sure sign of a simple mind!" and "She sure do shed, don't she?" has come in mighty handy on more than one occasion.I no longer read the "Guess who, Mrs. Fowler" gossip column item in lieu of a far more hilarious one, and favorite lines such as "That old gasoline truck, she's sixty if she's a minute" have evolved into "And as you say, you have so many men" and from there to "Is you the lady who forgot her toofbrush?" Such are the pleasures of watching this hilarious movie over and over and over again. There's always something new.</fullReview>

What makes The Women so spectacular is that real acting wasn't required on Joan's part. She was just as sarcastic and cruel to Norma off the set as well. I could go on for years talking about their offscreen rivalry, but I should also note that The Women is a great movie. In addition to an all-star cast (headed by many a Scarlett O'Hara reject by GWTW's fired director George Cukor), there are no males - even male animals - in the film. The script is great, too. Shearer, Crawford, Russell, Fontaine, and Goddard spit lines at each other like nobody's business. Most people will agree with me that this is a first-rate movie that no film buff should miss under any circumstances.

I cannot resist mentioning my like of both the characters played by Mary Boland and Marjorie Main.

		<shortDescription>More tales from the set</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since we're trading stories, my favorite involves Norma Sharer, Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell who were all quite competitive with each other. According to legend, they each wanted to be the last on the set. First came the parade of limos. Norma would be driven up and if Crawford weren't already on the set she wouldn't come in. Then Crawford would be driven up - ditto if Shearer weren't on the set. They would have circled the soundstage for hours if Cukor hadn't sent his assistant out there to stop the limos and send the two actresses inside. Once inside Russell would join the game. Now they would wait to see who would be the last one out of their portable dressing room and onto the set. Each lady would wait until the others arrived on set so she could be the grand lady. This went on until Cukor personally pulled all three out of their portables and brought them bodily onto the set.Fortunately for Cukor there was only one scene in which all three ladies appeared, but he had his Shearer/Crawford and Crawford/Russell scenes so he had his work cut out for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is one of my all-time favorite movies. Not only is it witty but is wonderfully entertaining. Not many movies have brought so many of the great classic film actresses together. Every part, no matter how big or small, was integral to the movie. I'm reminded of a comment Crawford made when she was considering taking the role of Crystal. Her desire to play this part was looked down upon my many. It was felt that Crystal was too small a part for an actress of her stature, and she would play the bad girl against perennial good girl, Norma Shearer. Crawford's comment to the criticism: "I would play Wallace Beery's mother if it was a good part!" Wonderful, wonderful movie...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heed the warnings to pay close attention - there's lots to hear. Rosalind Russell is her usual manic, ironic, and hilarious self.In case you did not know, there are no men shown in this movie. Even the animals are female. However, the director is male (ah, well, it was made in 1939). There was a movement afoot in Hollywood a year or so ago to remake this movie. Several prominent actresses gathered for a reading. Apparently nothing happened; can't decide if this is good or bad. Of course, no one can do Crawford like Crawford and Russell is irreplaceable too. The rest of the casting, in this movie at least (Fontaine's turn in Rebecca should be left untouched), cannot be held sacred. Too bad we couldn't mix a bit of the old with a bit of the new. I'd be interested in hearing casting suggestions! :) Oh, yes, the movie of a thousand quotables. More of my favorites from this film (crawford has the best lines, although pauline goddard gets some really good woman-of-the-world ones too): Every ladle's sweet that dishes out some gravy. Our new one-piece lace undergarment. Zips up the back and no bones.Ah, l'amour, l'amour! Thanks, but when Steven doesn't like what I'm wearing, I take it off. (or something to that effect) When are you gonna get wise to yourself, sister? There's a word for you ladies, but it's not used in polite society - outside a kennel. Worst line in the movie is the last - don't look unless you want to know what happens: Pride? That's something a woman in love can't afford!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Classic George Cukor film about a group of women and their relationships with each other. The primary plot point being Norma Shearer's husband is cheating on her with Joan Crawford. All-female cast is excellent with wonderful performances by all. Particularly noteworthy are Shearer, Crawford, and Rosalind Russell as the catty gossip Sylvia. Obviously the biggest drawback to the film is its dated idea that husbands are going to cheat and that's just a cross wives have to bear. Still, despite this, it's a wonderful film that has so many superb performances from some truly great actresses. It's funny, touching, and a joy to watch for fans of classic movies. Remade a couple of times but never close to this good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Greatest Chick Flick of the Twentieth Century</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director George Cukor's cinematic adaptation of Claire Booth's catty Broadway play "The Women" ranks as an unforgettable, tour-de-force woman's epic that features a first-rate cast, including the incomparable Academy Award winning actress Norma Shearer of "The Divorcée, Joan Crawford on her ascension to stardom as the villainous 'other woman,' Rosalind Russell, Joan Fontaine, and Paulette Goddard. The thing that sets "The Women" apart from virtually every woman's melodrama ever made is that the cast, including the pets and animals, consists strictly of dames, dames, and dames. Indeed, this film boasted over 130 roles for women. Not one single man shows up in this lengthy but juicy saga about wives, mothers, and mistresses. Well, there is a male bull in a cartoon during the fashion show, but it is the only male. The action opens at Sydney's Salon on Park Avenue in Manhattan where women come for a variety of exercise and beauty treatments. Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell of "His Girl Friday") is having her nails down when she hears the manicurist mention the name Haines. Sylvia has finally gotten some hot gossip and she shares it over the telephone with her pal Edith. Everything centers around a happily married woman who discovers that her honorable hubby is two-timing her with a department store clerk who sells perfume! Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) lives a storybook life. Her wealthy husband has provided sumptuously for her and they have a pre-teen daughter, little Mary (Virginia Weidler of "Peter Ibbetson") who adores her dad, too. Mary's friend, the scheming Sylvie sends her best friend to get her nails down at Sydney's Salon. In the process of getting her nails painted 'jungle red,' Mary learns that her faithful husband is having an affair with a dastardly clerk, Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford of "Our Dancing Daughters"), who is hungry for a meal ticket. Mary's mother, Mrs. Moorehead (Lucile Watson of "Made For Each Other"), advises her to tolerate Stephen's infidelity, but Mary refuses to heed her mom's advice. Instead, she prefers to divorce Stephen and winds up in the divorce capital of the world in those days--Reno, Nevada,--where she runs into several colorful characters, including The Countess De Lave (Mary Boland of "Stingaree" in a bravura performance) and Miriam Aarons (Paulette Goddard of "Modern Times") who are getting divorces. Joan Fontaine plays a young married woman who cannot stand to part with her husband and then rejoins him during an eleven hour surprise."Gentlemen Prefer Blondes" scenarist Anita Loos and "The Notorious Lady" scribe Jane Murfin penned the screenplay and their dialogue crackles with incandescent wit to spare. Novelist F. Scott Fitzgerald and "The Barretts of Wimpole Street" writer Donald Ogden Stewart made uncredited contributions to the script. "The Women" never seems to run out of stream and the action is steamy between the scenes in Reno and the final outcome in New York City. The performances are flawless. Cuker provides a dress show in color that looks like it could have been edited out. The initial confrontation between Mary and Crystal in a woman's department store fitting room is classic. Crawford excels as the sleazy, slimy villain, while Shearer is superb as the naive heroine. Rosalind Russell is impeccable as comic relief. Mary Boland nearly steals the second half of the movie as a ditsy dame who has been married multiple times. Check Crawford's bathtub after she moves in with Mary's ex-husband. Mary's mother's advise to ignore Stephen's fling is one of the two best speeches in this first-rate melodrama, while Miriam's speech about a woman walking out on her cheating husband is like leaving him to fend for himself against malaria is the running up. The gossip is great. Apart from the fashion interlude, Cukor never lets the action flag. African-American actress Butterfly McQueen make her film debut in this classic."The Women" is the ultimate chick flick, never to be surpassed!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Highest rating for this superb version of the Clare Booth Luce film dealing with what gossip can do to happy people.1939 was certainly a banner year for motion pictures. Amazing to me that "The Women" was not nominated for best picture.What a brilliant idea not to use men in the film but to refer to them constantly. What an all-star cast is prevalent is this grand production. The dialogue is snappy and absolutely first rate. The wonderful Norma Shearer is Mary Haines, whose marriage falls when she allows gossip by a manicurist to get the best of her.Joan Crawford is as viciously good as ever as Crystal Allen. Who can beat Roz Russell in the wonderful part of Sylvia Fowler. Mrs. Fowler, friends like her you never needed.A golden masterpiece of a treasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Shearer all the way!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many reviews of this film by the pros and almost without exception they marvel at Crawford's "stealing" the picture. I have never agreed with this opinion. Crawford's "Crystal" is fun, sure, but I can imagine any number of actresses could do the part as well (just take a look at her co-worker at the perfrume counter who gets in a few good lines too). For me, it's Norma Shearer's picture from start to finish. Yes, she's grand in the old Hollywood tradition with that upper crust manner of speaking they liked to affect back then (her mother is even worse) but I suppose that kind of drama is needed to put over such an anti-women's lib script as this one. I don't understand how so many reviewers cite her arm-stretching gesture at the end as over-dramatic silent-film acting. She is afterall going back to her husband who we have never seen. What was she supposed to be reaching for? On that same note I still cringe whenever Mary decides that even after two years of her ex-husband's philandering, she can't wait to take the jerk back. And the way the women are so spoiled is outrageous too. Even the Catholic one who does nothing but have baby after baby (thank God she's rich!!) gets to have enough maids and servants so that the children are more of an annoyance than a responsibility. Any even though everyone seems to rave about Rosalind Russell, I find her part the most over the top. And whoever thinks this movie is as timely today as it was in 1939 must really be living in la la land. Can you imagine the reaction of today's women to these five who do nothing but live for their husbands? There'd be a riot at the movie house! Nevertheless, the real gem of the picture is the Countess De Lav. I always get a kick out of when she says on the train to Reno "I don't pick them for character. I'll bet you picked yours for character and where did it get you? On the train to Reno." A great rainy day movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great moments in late movies . . . In the opening sequence, as the guests are entering the weekend retreat and gossiping about Rosalind Russell's character, one might be reminded of the similar opening of Renoir's "Regle du jeu," (my all-time favorite film), made the same year. As Russell makes her entrance, sweeping across the room, she stops and looks at a painting on the wall closely. When someone asks her what's the matter, she replies: "Oh, nothing - I thought it was a Renoir." An inside joke from Cukor to anyone in the present, or more likely future, who had seen Renoir's masterpiece. Cukor's film version of Luce's play lacked the grand ambitions of Renoir's allegory, but can be seen as a similar, if lower-case, commentary on pre-war American culture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow! what great actresses, from Joan Crawford (husband stealer) versus robbed wife Norma Shearer,...Paulette Goddard as "been there done that wrong" marriage counselor to Norma, with great appearances by Mary Boland (much-married rich Countess now a Cowboy's wife), little Virginia Wiedler as Norma's young daughter, and many, many more. Rosalind Russell as the silly loud wife of poor long-suffering unseen Howard Fowler was the biggest hit of all! There is an undercurrent of sadness, tho. Apparently most women are to accept the fact that their man will stray (as Norma's mother and others tell her). And child actress Virginia Wiedler (excellent earlier in The Philadelphia Story) shows a child's pain as she faces Mother and Father's separation, divorce, and Father's selfish new wife...It is really fun to read the more detailed reviews above. I won't rehash the great quotes and quips they repeat...from this well written movie.And check the Internet for that Renaissance Woman's name ---who wrote this zinging play...Clare Booth Luce!

Big PS--- Rosalind Russell was the BIG HIT as unseen Howard's silly wife...Ironies of ironies...A danish man crossing the Atlantic when UBoats were sinking ships like his...watched this movie over &amp; over, maybe to relieve the tension of hoping they won't be torpedoed...&amp; he was so charmed by this movie's best actress, that he hunted down Rosalind Russell and married her...

		<shortDescription>A Top 10 Kweenie Klassix</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Women is so meticulously and exquisitely crafted that it transcends mere movie immortality and ascends into the realms of sublime divinity. If you're a queen, that is. Few people but the queens and other assorted malcontents really even care that this... this thing, this passion play of gowns, furs, Fifth Avenue, jewelry, more gowns, soignée parties, interiors and artifice, artifice, artifice, even exists. And the dialogue? Easily on the list of Top Five Movies With the Snappiest Dialogue. And, you know what else? There are no men in it. It's 132 minutes of pure mud-slinging, back-biting, sh*t-eating bitchiness, all dolled up in one tidy little litter box. Meow.The roles are superbly cast from the saintly society matron of Norma Shearer to Rosalind Russell at her gum-snapping, wisecracking best, to Joan Crawford as the Bitch Queen Hussy of All Time. The fact is that The Women is a secret plot by a few phenomenally gifted artists and designers to produce a basic-training film for young queens. It was so successful, look around you, every queen you know in life today is represented in this movie. But it trains queens to be Real Women in every way, how to handle every situation like a real woman, how to speak, walk in heels, how to pose, how to live! Unfortunately for us all, however, women like this don't really exist. They are composite women in a world that never existed. And that's the problem with most queens, too. Anyway, it's glorious in its excesses, but be prepared - the lines fly by so fast, that only after multiple viewings, do you really hear the lines these women are saying to each other, and they are some of the wittiest, most sarcastic, and urbane lines ever written. In my personal video collection, it is Kweenie Klassix #1. In my life, it is God.</fullReview>

I just loved all the different characters and the way they interacted with each other. Rosalind Russell is particularly funny in her role, fast talking and gossipy, which was a departure from her usual stuffy uppity characters. Casting her in this part was a gamble for Cukor; a gamble that paid off! A little outdated in its view of woman/men relationships, but other than that, a very entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie seems just as current and effective as when it was made. Funny and catty and truly full of wonderful moments. It is a true testament to the genius of George Cukor. However, it is also full of wonderful performances by most of the best actresses of the day. Joan Crawford portrays the penultimate man stealing cat. Norma Shearer is however a bit too "self sacrificing" and noble at times. Rosalind Russell is magnificent as a gossip monger who's not all bad at heart. However, Paulette Goddard steals the scenes she's in as the wily Miriam. And a wonderful but short perfomance by the always wonderful Marjorie Main as Lucy the ranch owner. Lucy runs a boarding ranch for women waiting in Reno to get divorced.I would recommend this movie to anyone who wanted to spend a couple of hours laughing and enjoying themselves. Despite the fact that not one man appears in it, it's almost entirely about men as reflected by the women who love them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Due to an excellent script ("Get me a bromide... and put some gin in it!") and equally on-target performances, this film is as entertaining today as it must have been when it was released in 1939. George Cukor captures the energy of a stage performance in the many hilarious group scenes, while using the intimacy of film to draw us close into the story's occasional heartbreaks. Actresses Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford are both equally versatile in this regard, especially Crawford, who certainly knows how to stride into a room, not to mention twist and turn behind the perfume counter while on the phone with her lover, telling him white lie after white lie as a sarcastic co-worker makes hilarious (and occasionally racist) comments. Norma Shearer's Mary Haines is so down-to-earth and likeable, her occasional forays into the dramatic over-gestures of her silent film days only make us love her more.The precursor to such latter-day films as Steel Magnolias, The Women outshines them all. You'll want to see it again to catch all that rapid-fire dialogue of Rosalind Russell's (Mary Fowler) that whizzed over head on the first go-round. Pour yourself a glass of "La Champagne" and see The Women today!</fullReview>

Never had the silver screen so much silver! The images sparkle as much as the dialogue, which sounds like a gay man's version of women. It's hard to believe that women wrote this nonstop torrent of verbosity. One wonders what the play is trying to prove, that women are base creatures, men are gods? No man appears in the movie, as if a man's appearance would spoil the notion that men are perfection. This is not a nice movie at all. Misanthropy reigns.

Having said that, I do appreciate this movie for its brilliant wit and wisdom, fast paced dialogue, and funny episodes especially with Roz Russell. Mary Boland as the Countess also has her special moments when speaking from experience. Nice to see Butterfly McQueen briefly in her first film prior to her memorable role in "Gone With the Wind."Notable also for the dramatic part as the matronly and wise mother of Mary Haines (Norma Shearer), is Lucile Watson whose next film role was similar in the poignant romance,"Waterloo Bridge" which starred Vivien Leigh just after GWTW.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I stumbled across this movie late one night when I was suffering insomnia - and it certainly woke me up further! "The Women" is a marvelous showcase from some of the biggest female stars in 1939 - and it certainly shows why they were at the pinnacle of their profession.The film explores the relationships between a group of women after one of them (Mary Haines) discovers that her husband is having an affair with a shop girl (Crystal). Mary is, naturally, devastated - and astonished when her mother gives her some extremely down to earth advice (to wit: live with it. All men do it) and she also starts to see her "friends" in a different light as well.We watch her as the "other woman" starts to invade all aspects of her life - from her husband, to her hairdresser and beautician to the designer where she buys her clothes.One can't help but feel that her friends - whilst they seemingly rally around her, also start to cultivate Crystal as well: just in case! When Mary decides to go for a quickie divorce from her husband, we meet a whole new cast of females in the same situation - and Mary grows even further as she learns new lessons from them.There is not one male in the cast, and it is very interesting to watch a relationship between a man and a woman without any male/female interaction visible, although it is plainly there out of camera sight.Interesting metaphorical use is made of "Jungle Red" colour of nail polish through the movie - from when it's first mentioned in the same breath as Mary learns about Crystal, to the end of the movie, when Mary emerges as a single woman determined to make her mark.You won't be disappointed with this movie - even after almost 70 years, it's still fresh and original - I think that it's probably the original "Sex and the City" group of women!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is a bitter satire resting on the spoiled lives and struggles for clout and control of a variety of wealthy Manhattan women, social climbers and up-and-comers and the gossip that drives and wounds their relationships. At the same time men are recurrently the focus of their airy banter and take part in important functions of the action on screen, they are no more than characters mentioned but never seen.Norma Shearer plays a fashionable wife and mother who learns by way of hearsay that her husband is having an affair and leaves him. Shearer is far from the strongest actress in the film. Rosalind Russell thoroughly steals every scene she is in, hitting the nail on the head as the epitome of the gossipy, scatter-brained, motor-mouthed drama queen who brings the most wit and laughs to the film's mercurial verbal spars. Joan Crawford, Shearer's husband's cold adulterous lover, renews the comfort of your seat in front of the screen after a first act that does not keep up with the speed of its characters' mouths. It follows that the bitchy exchanges spin into great fun and laughs when Russell and sexy, brassy Paulette Goddard burst out into a catfight.Madcap and unpredictable in temperament just like its characters, George Cukor's estrogen festival, at its core, becomes a little too affectionate with the object of its acidic commentary. As a result, it goes through tedious troughs like the color fashion show sequence included in this black-and-white film which has no content but the glossy spectacle of fashion. This loss of cynical edge causes one to feel that the film's criticisms are ones that it merits itself, that every single character acts as if her function in life is defined by men, and that we are intended to ponder these childish and high-strung women who think about and act upon nothing more than the battle of the sexes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cukor's women are an entertaining lot.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cukor's reputation as a "women's director" reached it's apex in this 1939 comedy, appropriately titled THE WOMEN. The cast is all female, and there are some great names here: Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard and Joan Fontaine, to name but a few. In fact, only two contracted MGM players (Garbo and Garson) did not feature in this film. It's a treat for the various actresses, who get to bitch, entertain, bitch, shop and bitch with each other for the entire 133 minute running length.Unfortunately this film, while it is a genuine classic with snappy writing and some spot-on performances, has limited appeal...if you don't like the idea of watching a gaggle of vain females bickering over men for a couple of hours, you probably won't get into it. And while much of the dialogue is razor-sharp, and the film is quite funny at times, it is over-long, and really does feel like just a glamour fashion parade for MGM's top female stars. Hell, a fashion parade sequence (filmed in Technicolour) even appears in the film! It is gorgeous to look at, but really does nothing for the plot and slows the entire film.Russell and Goddard give the best performances of the picture, culminating in a fun cat-fight near the film's conclusion. Former, now fading, MGM queen Shearer is quite good in her role, though that last shot of her at the ending (completely over-the-top mugging) almost ruins everything that went before it. Crawford is bitchy and fits her role like a glove. The supporting actresses Boland, Main, Povah and Hussey are a hoot, while child actress Weidler gets very annoying very quickly. Fontaine, one year off the brilliant success of REBECCA, is still stuck in her sweet, blank little lamb mode (she is even likened to a lamb in the opening credits!) Altogether quite entertaining, but it's not really my thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mid-20th Century Rules of Female Survival Deftly Handled by a Game Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The constant verbal jousting in this 1939 classic has layers of vitriolic wit and honest insight thanks to the sharp script penned by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin from Clare Booth Luce's legendary 1936 females-only Broadway hit. Crisply directed by George Cukor who is completely in his milieu here, the movie is really a mid-20th century survivor's guide for wealthy, insulated women seeking comfort and security in a world where they are defined solely by their husbands. While it is still an accomplished film in many respects, the 133-minute running time feels overly long as the mile-a-minute catty comments grow wearisome despite the deftness of their delivery by an estimable ensemble cast.The plot is straightforward. Socialite Mary Haines is a loving wife and mother whose decade-long marriage produces a wandering eye in her off-screen husband Stephen. Once he takes up with a predatory perfume salesgirl named Crystal Allen, Mary takes the train west to Reno for a divorce at which point Stephen and Crystal marry. But Mary is determined to win him back, as she knows full well that Crystal will eventually tire of Stephen and move on to greener pastures. It all ends in a bracing series of confrontations in what looks to be the world's largest powder room. What makes this story richer than the outline of events is the multi-voiced flow of gossip and advice pummeling Mary from her immediate social circle, in particular, her vituperative cousin and apparent best friend Sylvia Fowler.The three leads are impeccably cast. As the virtuous Mary, Norma Shearer is saddled with the dullest part since she has to react to the shenanigans circling her. However, she radiates her trademark class and a genuine sense of warmth. Joan Crawford was born to play the rapacious Crystal as she dynamically conveys the cynicism of her character's motives. Even though the main conflict is between Mary and Crystal, classic scene-stealer Rosalind Russell makes Sylvia a perfectly venal yet oddly endearing character with her wacky outfits and slapstick pratfalls. Over 130 women surround this trio, including a gallery of memorable characters embodied by an impressive bevy of studio-era actresses from Mary Boland's over-the-top Countess DeLave to a young pre-Hitchcock Joan Fontaine as irritatingly demure Peggy to Paulette Goddard's no-nonsense Miriam to Lucile Watson as Mary's worldly wise mother to Marjorie Main as the loud Reno dude ranch operator.Even with the inclusion of a knockdown catfight between Russell and Goddard, the film gets overly dramatic at times, highlighting Shearer's penchant for grand lady mannerisms, and there is a completely excisable ten-minute fashion show shot in early Technicolor to show off Adrian's extravagant costume designs. Special mention should be given to Cedric Gibbons' luxuriant art direction and Edwin Willis' set designs. The 2005 DVD has two vintage shorts of marginal interest - "Hollywood: Style Center of the World" about Adrian's fashion influence on everyday wear by American women, and "From the Ends of the Earth: Another Romance of Celluloid" about the use of textile imports in studio films. There is also a trailer for the film as well as one for the unnecessary 1956 musical remake, "The Opposite Sex". Completely disposable is an alternate black-and-white version of the fashion show and over forty minutes of original score and source music cues.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grand Theft By Crawford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just as she did in "Grand Hotel" some seven years earlier, Joan Crawford steals this picture too -- from an equally formidable cast.For some, Crawford is the Hollywood Star they love to hate.For others, she was an impressive screen actor and (especially early) spectacular beauty and legendary face on par with Garbo. "The Women" is ostensibly Norma Shearer's picture. She's terrific. She's perfectly cast as a wealthy mother whose husband leaves her for another woman (Crawford). Shearer was a good film actor and her slight "star" affectations (see the final shot of "The Women") suit her character. She could also be down-to-earth and genuinely moving.So could Crawford (see "Grand Hotel"). Crawford also had a spectacularly photogenic face, which she'd already learned to control like a virtuoso by 1939. As Crystal, Crawford is a sexy, striking shopgirl with ambitions (female ambition, in those days, meaning snagging a rich husband: not becoming a neurosurgeon or senator). Not really predatory (she doesn't stalk rich men so much as take advantage when the situation presents itself), her character could have come across as utterly unsympathetic and heartless. Thanks to Crawford's relaxed and confident playing, she doesn't.Crawford walks off with the picture. She's thoroughly believable in every scene. She's sexy and voracious enough to capture any man she wants. She's common enough to be believable as a perfume clerk in a department store and pretentious enough to be believed as a would-be diva in that transparent bubble bath scene.Rosalind Russell was certainly the better actor of the three (Shearer and Crawford and Russell) and had nearly as long a career as Crawford. But not here."The Women" demonstrates an interesting fact about Crawford in relation to the other actors in the picture and to film history itself.Crawford and Russell were on their way "up." Shearer was about to retire. Their acting styles and techniques were completely different. And Russell proved the most versatile actor of the three, over many film and stage performances.Yet in "The Women," one is constantly aware that both Russell and Shearer are "acting." As wonderful and impressive as their performances are, one keeps thinking, "Damn, she's good." With Crawford, on the other hand, one forgets about the actor (her) until long after the picture's over, so convincingly does she inhabit Crystal.The same is true with "Grand Hotel," where one keeps admiring Garbo and John Barrymore's "technique," yet forgets that Flaemmchen is actually being played by Crawford until after "The End." That Flaemmchen and Kringelein (Lionel Barrymore) affectingly walk off "into the sunset" together at the conclusion of "Grand Hotel" seems fitting. Not only were their characters meant for each other at that moment in their lives, but they were by far the two best actors on the screen.So it is with "The Women." Rosalind Russell is wonderful. She's over-the-top. Nobody in real life, then or now, could get by with that sort of obnoxious self-centered behavior and last five minutes in those social circles.Russell's performance is great fun. But it's still a "performance" and lacks the depth of a real human being. Which is why Russell sticks out like a sore thumb in "The Women." All the other actors embody some heart and soul to slightly greater or lesser degrees. Russell is all surface schtick. Quality schtick, but still . . . .It's easy to say, "Well, that's Sylvia Foster's character." But it's not. Sylvia Foster's actually a woman who's desperate to fit in with the other women, but knows she doesn't. All she has to offer as her reason for being is gossip. And to get it, she has to meddle. There are moments throughout the role where Russell could have given a flicker of Sylvia's desperation and feelings of inferiority, but she doesn't. Her instinct in 1939 was to go broad -- even slapstick. So she does.Fun. But not in the same league with Crawford's Crystal.Same for Shearer. She can be effective, and is a good actor. Yet her range is limited. It's impossible, really, to separate Shearer's movie-star mannerisms from her characters'. With the final scene, all her good work in "The Women" is erased in what looks like a vanity closeup with arms outstretched and Shearer's face overemoting as she rushes to welcome her errant (off-camera) ex-husband back.Not that it's a bad ending. But Director George Cukor might have had the professionalism to keep shooting it until Shearer had toned down her gesticular and facial histrionics to something resembling real life.Because it's Crawford's "real life" approach to this film and this character that distinguishes her from the other leads and succeeds in making Crystal the most likable and enjoyable of "The Women" despite the script's perspective on her character.After "The Women," Crawford didn't have to steal any more films. She had stolen "Grand Hotel" from Garbo and the Barrymores (in cahoots with Lionel), and now absconded with "The Women." From 1939 on, CRAWFORD was THE star and everybody else a bit player in all her films. Up to and including "Trog." Russell went on to hone her craft spectacularly in both drama and comedy, both stage and film.Shearer went on to discover both Janet Leigh and Robert Evans, and to marry a ski instructor twenty years her junior.Crawford went on -- and on -- to "Baby Jane" and, finally, "Trog." Crawford, alone of the three in "The Women," went on to become a film Legend.Shearer and Russell are loved and admired and appreciated.But Legends? No.Crawford still provokes arguments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I view this movie as one of my guilty pleasures--I love the performances (particularly Russell) and I think it's elegantly constructed, but I can't help applying a '90s sensibility to a '30s movieStill, it's a tremendously fun movie to watch, especially the opening sequence. Russell, as I've said before, is so hysterically funny that I can't believe this was her first comic role. Crawford is at her best, and there isn't a liability anywhere in the supporting cast. To remake this movie today would be a crime against humanity, especially if the director went completely insane and added men to the cast.I have to wonder, though, what the actresses thought of that opening credits where they were compared to animals. Phyllis Povah as a cow, for example, seems needlessly cruel.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely love Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell, but despite their impeccable abilities to act I did not enjoy the movie. As a female myself I found the movie incredibly annoying. The characters were talking as such a high pitch voice, over one another at times and they were so dramatic. It was not my cup of tea. I did enjoy the remake much more because the women were more relatable. The color allowed for the movie to seem more realistic and I could understand more of the character's personality. Unfortunately I could's do that with the original. I expected to capture the women's strength and humor like I saw in the remake. Sadly the characters made women seem overly dramatic and obnoxious. Women don't always make things feel like the end of the world especially a break up nowadays. Pro: the crazy fashion show</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyed a look into the past and the Year 1939, where this Black &amp; White film turns into a color film during a Fashion Show of the hottest female attire and biggest stars in Hollywood. Norma Shearer,( Mrs. Stephen Haines), losses her husband to a sexy Joan Crawford, (Crystall Allen), who is a dame that has been around the city block a few TIMES. Rosalind Russell, (Mrs. Howard Fowler), is a so called friend of Mrs. Haines, (Mary) however, she loves to gossip behind her back a long with quite a few other ladies in the Beauty Salon, where all kinds of Catty things are talked about and Enjoyed. This film could possibly have won an Academy Award, however, in 1939 there was the "Wizard of Oz" and "Gone with the Wind" to contend with and therefore this film received very little attention until later years, namely 2005! Great film with great great Classic Women Actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best films of 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My Mother has a group of friends who I consistently find myself referring to them as "The Women like the ones from "The Women". Indeed, these ladies could be easily enough found it real life. They're like floating seaweed upon every shore. MGM hit a gold mine with this one, and it was a deserved hit.I still rate this film amongst my ten best comedies ever made list. Much of the movie's strengths lies in the bitchy, hilarity of a witty twisted script, clever and unequalled by most. The fact that the movie has an absence of men makes it a bit of a novelty too. The acting is first rate. Norma Shearer, in the lovable role of naive Mary Haines is great, but as the studio queen, gets her moments of silent film glory. Rosalind Russell shines in her first real comedy role, but gets even better in "His Girl Friday". I still hated Joan Crawford who couldn't have been anything less than her proud, lowest of the low character. They are backed up nicely by Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard, Virginia Weidler and Joan Fontaine. One person I would have liked to see more of was Ruth Hussey, the twenty five year old who supported Kate, Cary and Jimmy in "The Philadelphia Story" as Liz. Her role was too much of a blink and a miss one.This is one of George Cukor's best movies. Often underrated and defined as 'the women's director', he was definitely one of the master directors of the era. His direction is delectable, with the laughs coming hard and non-stop.A remake would ruin the still modern day like movie. It could not be survived by current Hollywood, with a rising trend of turning previous golden greats into movies that leave a bitter feeling in the mouth.Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Putting "The Women" in Its Place</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Norma Shearer (as Mary) discovers her husband is having an affair with Joan Crawford (as Crystal), she learns women must not be proud. Rosalind Russell (as Sylvia) leads an MGM parade of supporting players - all women; in fact, only women appear in the film! But, don't expect a "feminist" statement from George Cukor's "The Women". The message may waver, but it never really gets too far away from putting women in their place. If the film is about anything other than being faithful and subservient to your man, it's about gossip. It could have been titled "Gossip".What's appealing about "The Women" is enjoying some of its fine, albeit dated, dialog and situations. There are scores of actresses to watch; Ms. Shearer and Ms. Russell come off best, but appreciators of any will like their favorites. Ms. Crawford likes to smoke in her bathtub. The film's fun is severely weakened by an extremely distracting interlude - the "Fashion Show" - which is presented in COLOR. "Gimmicks" like the color segment and the all female cast ruin "The Women"; and, the acceptance of a "double standard" for men and women is presented as part of a great woman's character. ****** The Women (9/1/39) George Cukor ~ Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norma Shearer, an almost infuriatingly sane and even-keeled actress, is once again typecast as the Voice of Good Reason. Here, she's an upscale wife and mother who finds out that her husband is having an affair and leaves him; her girlfriends surround her for support, but they're going through their own marital woes. Catty, brightly chatty screen-adaptation of Claire Booth's celebrated play is well-cast with energetic actresses and never bows to soapy melodrama; yet, when all is revealed, it's rather tame and good-girly. The color fashion show sequence inserted into this otherwise black-and-white film really says it all: the picture is less about relationships than it is about how fabulous each woman looks.

		<shortDescription>The Women a Movie that will stand the test of time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie practically elaborated on three women, and all the other characters were there to help unravel the situations of the main characters. Based on the problems of Mary Haines, wife of Steven Haines (a cheating husband). Mary Haines goes through trials and tribulations with a gossip cousin (Sylvia Howard) as a friend and a perfume counter girl (Crystal Allen) who steals her husband (and a friends husband too). The acting of this movie was typical to the time period but great among the cast of actors is one of the greats Joan Crawford. The most unique aspect of this movie is that although there is talk of men, there are never any men to ever appear on screen in the film. Also the movie is in black and white but takes color in a scene at a fashion show. There are many great attributes to make this movie notable, but I do not recommend to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that not aged in the best way and that has many stereotypes! chauvinism of course but with fun moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A film so trendy but not aged in the best way. "The Women" can be seen with pleasure. It's not totally boring. Nevertheless, it is very long and has too many dialogue. The viewer can get tired. But worst of all is the chauvinism present in the film. The director, George Cukor, is a man who I appreciate a lot. I'm not a fan of any of his films that I've seen, but I like some as "My Fair Lady" and "The Filadelphia Story". "The Women" was the film I liked most of Cukor, but it is not at all his best work. Why? Because of the chauvinism. Cukor is a wise man. I like to hear him. He is homosexual and their women, in the movies, have friendly personalities (Katherine Hepburn is wonderful in "The Filadelphia Story"). But the women in the film in question are catty, talk cheap, poisonous and futile. There are women like so, in fact. The stereotype is not a lie but it is a very big generalization. Of course there are friendly women in the movie, as Norma Shearer, Joan Fontaine and Paulette Goddard's characters. But most of the women don't behave in a good way. As if stereotypes weren't enough, the film shows that a woman can not be happy without her husband. I would like to see Mary (Norma) without Stephen in the end and happy with her divorce.Rosalind Russell is the best. Fun despite venomous. I know she is very stereotypical but she is very funny. Joan Fontaine is pretty bad. I like this actress, although I think she is not versatile. In "Rebecca," "Suspicion" and "Letter from an Unknown Woman," Joan does the same role. And in "The Women" too. Joan does a good job in the other films but, in "The Women", she is very weak as an actress. Paulette Goddard is fine and beautiful. Rosalind and Paulette are the best for me. Mary Boland is also quite good.Norma and Joan Crawford are well, but not fascinated. Crawford has a very ordinary role but it shows that she is a versatile actress. She can play the victim (Mildred Pierce) and the poisonous woman (The Women).With "The Women", you can see how things have not changed much. The soap operas continue to represent the same way these stories of betrayals and some of the stereotypes. I recommend this movie to show this subjects in a time when they were little explored and for the fun times and the fascinating beginning in the beauty salon."The Women" aged badly because it shows stereotypes and subjects that are already very seen (too famous and valued for me. over valuation, no doubt)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women is a fast paced, witty and an amusing "Chick Flick". Very forward thinking for its time. The relations and gossip within The Women is timeless. I thoroughly enjoyed this film from its dialogue, character development, story, and cinematography. I thought that there was a variety of characters both flat and round AND there wasn't just one star carrying it through like other movies. I thought the acting was great and the dialogue is sharp. It was a lot like the Stagecoach in that a group of characters were all different but yet tied in together when Mary met the women on the train to Reno. The ending was a bit of a surprise and brought justice to the women who were all in unfortunate situations due to one girl. The story flows and moves along quite nicely. There's a lot going on, it's a dense and complex film with many facets. The things portrayed in this film are not ancient nor are they outdated, these values and behaviors are still found in our society and I think this film is a valuable portrait of that. Overall, it's a very interesting, funny, and intelligent movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A funny, sometimes touching movie with an all-female cast about a naive woman who learns from a manicurist that her husband is having an affair. The movie focuses on a group of Park Avenue women who have nothing better to do all day than lunch, get their nails done and go to fashion shows; the only part of the movie in full color. Mary the protagonist, is the least gossipy of the group and genuinely in love with her husband Steven when she learns of the affair. Mary manages to stay dignified throughout the ordeal and even through the divorce and thankfully Steven's mistress (played by a beautiful Joan Crawford) gets her comeuppance in the end. The movie is beautifully done with lavish sets and expensive fashions and it was refreshing not to see a single male in the picture; however as a modern woman I cannot help but take offense to the portrayal of women as gossipy, materialistic and petty. Thank heavens for comedic portrayal of Sylvia (Mary's so-called friend) by Rosalind Russell and The Countess De Lave ("l'amore") and Miriam, who Mary meets on the train to Reno, for providing some intelligence to the shallowness portrayed by the other characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor was the director behind the 1930 film "The Women." The plot to this movie is very intricate. There are many different characters who connect in some way. The different view on marriage is portrayed in this movie. While I didn't care for the twists and turns of the movie, the idea behind it and how it all came together is something i can tolerate. The different movie viewers who may be interested in this movie could enjoy the different genres involved. However a large majority is based on romance. While many people may approve, this is definitely not a film for everyone. The view on the behaviors of each character is related to their social class, which is an interesting twist. It allows all different types of viewers to really see what the mind-set of other class' may be thinking and or acting. While the movie has it's different ties and interesting character aspects it's a movie that is worth a shot for many people; it may just not be the film for everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Once in a Lifetime Cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Women (1939) **** (out of 4) When MGM wanted to go all out with a splash they certainly knew how to do it. This film features a cast that is 100% female and it's perhaps the greatest collection of actresses that you're ever going to see. The movie is pretty much about woman who do nothing but gossip and the effect this has on Mary Haines (Norma Shearer) when she learns that her husband is having an affair with Crystal Allen (Joan Crawford). Had THE WOMEN been released in any other year in the history of cinema then it probably would have walked away with a Best Picture, Director, Actress (Shearer) and Supporting Actress (Crawford) but 1939 was such a strong year with so many landmark movies that it was pretty much shut out. When viewed today it's just incredible to see so much talent in one film. Not only do we get Shearer and Crawford turning in great work but there's also Rosalind Russell, Mary Boland, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine, Lucile Watson, Virginia Weidler, Phyllis Povah, Ruth Hussey, Virginia Grey, Marjorie Main and even Hedda Hopper. When the factory system of Hollywood shut down this type of cast just wasn't possible anymore so this here is certainly a once in a lifetime type of event. The story itself does start off a tad bit slow as we're introduced to way too many characters in such a quick time but once the main story kicks in things really turn to a brilliant status. There's a sequence where Shearer confronts Crawford that is so powerful you can see that the actresses are really wanting to go after one another. I'm sure there was a rivalry between the two professionals and you can see them wanting to out-do the other. Another standout is Russell who is simply wonderful as one of the villain gossipers. I will admit that it's somewhat strange seeing a movie with only one sex but there's just no denying that it's impossible to take you eyes off the screen. Yes, there are some moments that are a bit too melo-dramatic but with a cast like this it really doesn't matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes a kitten can take down a tiger....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>O.K., so in the opening credits, Norma Shearer's Mary Haines is not quite the kitten; She's actually a deer, I believe, gentle and civilized, while a variety of cats, cows, wild dogs and other creatures are used to describe the other females who populate this outstanding movie version of the classic 1936 Broadway play. But she is an interesting character to behold, the plot surrounding the break-up of her marriage because of the "minx" Crystal Allen, here none other than Joan Crawford returning to her shop girl roots as the vixen who runs her eyes up and down a man like a search light. Yes, Crawford is vicious here, but truly not as vicious as Rosalind Russell's venomous Sylvia Fowler. ("Mrs. Prowler", Crawford calls her after Russell visits her perfume counter.) "Mary is a woman", one of the friends describes her as. "And what are we?", Russell inquires. "Females!" And that is indeed the truth. You can see the archetype of every type of character here, even today, although back in the 1970's, a Broadway revival flopped because of the feminist outrage towards the stereotypes. Some actually are broads, particularly Paulette Goddard's Miriam, the sly fox in the credits, yet compassionate towards the heroine and eager to venge Mary with Sylvia by stealing her husband. Nothing wrong with being a broad, because her earthiness makes her truly more likable than the other schemers, even if she is a home-wrecker. Mary Boland's Countess DeLave (a monkey in the credits) is a silly and vane aging woman whose countless husbands have either tried to kill her, cheat her out of money or in the case of her new beau, turned to the bored Crawford. "Get Me a Bromide, and put some Gin in it!", the obviously intoxicated bubble-head sobs.There's also the constantly pregnant Phyllis Povah, the wise matriarch (Lucille Watson) who warns daughter Shearer not to trust her friends, the country bumpkin Marjorie Main (in early Ma Kettle mode) as the woman who runs the Reno home for recent divorcées. This is as far from 1930's "The Divorcée", a dry drama with slight comic overtones, and it makes a mockery out of society for looking at marriage with such revolving door intentions. Joan Fontaine's lamb is the dullest of the lot, but somebody had to represent the not yet mature innocent. Not so innocent is the wiser than her years Virginia Weidler as Little Mary who has no qualms about telling her new step mommy just what she thinks of her.No men at all, cried the advertisement for this all-star gem, and as directed by George Cukor, the best women's director of them all, everything is in place for a fight to the death for these sometimes silly creatures who ruled New York society back in the 1930's. Forget the depression and the hard-luck heroines played by Sylvia Sidney and Barbara Stanwyck; This is the Blue Book of Park Avenue, and many of these women all end up on the train to Reno. There's bits of other women thrown in for slice-of-the-rich-life society; A matron crying because there's worms in the mud she's bathing in; A grandmother who works out daily and parties nightly; A Hedda Hopper like gossip columnist named Dolly (played by Hedda Hopper); a mannish author who refers to herself as a "frozen asset"; and a gossipy manicurist who starts the rumors in the first place.So for two hours or so, sit back, laugh, relax, roll your eyes at the ridiculously gauche fashion show of clothes no sensible society women would wear (still going on at Fashion Week here in Manhattan) and see how many of the people you know in the 21st Century emulate someone from almost 80 years ago. Countless gay men can even point out people in their social circle who could be a Mary, a Crystal, a Sylvia (particularly the later), and feminists get off your high horse about this being dated and stereotypical. A 2000 Broadway revival was considered fresh enough to warrant a TV Broadcast, putting to rest the criticism of the 1973 revival. The wonderful thing about these 1930's drawing room comedy's written by those who knew is that there's still relevance to be found today, although it was sadly missing from the recent disastrous remake. Leave well enough alone when it comes to these classics. It can't be done better, no matter how many "modern" touches you add.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the Women 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The groundbreaking gimmick of this vintage George Cukor film is its female-inclusive cast, a bitch-fest orbits around the admiration of their off-screen male counterparts, it is a cornucopia of malicious gossips, cloying feminine bonds, fierce squabbles with vicious innuendos, and culminates with a tit-for-tat machination to win back a man's heart. My tone sounds disparaging, but the film is a hoot to watch, gathering 3 divas, several starlets and many old stagers (all main characters have their respective animal analogs indicate their dispositions before the film starts), Shearer is a worthy leading actress here, notwithstanding the fact that her character is a morally upright woman who may be too perfect to exemplify as a true-to-life impersonation, Shearer's sincerity and grace alone can effortlessly win over audiences' heart and against the grain the magnificence of her id outshines the alter ego on screen and retains the limelight. Crawford is the anti-heroine, a manipulative home-wrecker owns every second during her presence, could be her stock-of-trade by hindsight, but how can one not relish the sparkling confrontations between her and Shearer when words are still able to kill. The last but not the least of the trinity is Russell, a snooty socialite falls into utter caricature, a loudmouth and busybody, oscillates between her chameleon-like affinities (either to Shearer or to Crawford), she might be the most dangerous creature among all the distaff. Then among secondary tier, a drop-dead gorgeous Fontaine is the romantic dreamer, a reverential Boland is the undying love-pursuer, an elegant and witty Goddard is the tactful helper, then a worldly and sensible Watson is the mother who gives appropriate advice when it is needed, and a lovable and juvenile Weidler pulls through an empathetic daughter-mother rapport between her and Shearer. A vivid dissection of vicissitudes on Park Avenue, the film may not be able to be connected to the huddled mass, and its thematic POV "pride is a luxury a woman in love cannot afford" might not be align with today's viewpoint, THE WOMEN still has its unique value in spearheading a paradigm shifting experiment (although ironically women are without exception subordinate to their men in the film) to break the shackles which 74 years later unfortunately is still hedging the film business ubiquitously, not to mention the astonishing fashion-show during the midstream (the only color part in this otherwise monochrome artifact), with a retrospective gaze, everything else is a puff, only haute couture relentlessly lasts!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was basically about women who gossip. I realized how this movie just only has mostly high class women being catty. Then again that's what all woman do is gossip and talk behind your back then laugh in your face. This movie was pretty decent and had an easy well flow. I like how they knew each other without really knowing each other personally. Also, some of the camera work was pretty nice because you got an insight closely on each character. The movie was basically about pampered lives of women who are rich and they become bored and meet other rich women and talk they life away. In all this was a pretty funny movie that I can only watch once. To me this is like another chick flick, something close to mean girls in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Review of The Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found it fascinating that on screen the audience only sees women, but it's implied that men are involved in the story (in fact the whole story is about men), they just aren't explicit characters. The film is definitely humorous while capturing the lives of Manhattan socialites of the thirties perfectly. The scene where Mary travels from NYC to Reno to obtain a divorce is slightly unrealistic, but as the viewer, I went along with it anyway because I was sucked into the film. However the train ride to Reno makes for a beautiful scenic backdrop. While the women are on the train, you feel like you are right there with them. The film also has some great actresses, which really bring the film to life. They portray an accurate role of women in Manhattan, something that even people today can relate to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is definitely the chick flick of 1939. This movie is filled with details of the life of the everyday woman. It touches on friendship, marriage, motherhood, and divorce. The movie shows how a woman's life can be fun, but also tough. For example, when Mary hangs out with her friends, the audience can see that she can have fun. Another example is when Mary has to tell her daughter, Little Mary, that she is getting divorced from her father, a much more serious scene.The plot of a woman getting cheated on by her husband and getting divorced is something that is believable to any woman. Getting back together with that same husband is also possible, but not likely. The acting in this movie was great, especially from the woman who played Sylvia. It was hard sometimes to keep up with her dialog! The lighting and camera action was great as well. The camera shot that I remember most is the first scene of the movie where the camera follows a woman's feet and her dog to the other woman's feet and her dog. What also impressed me was how the fashion show was in color, not black and white. I believe that the use of color was necessary because without it, how could anyone really tell the garments apart? With color, the audience gets the full affect of the show. Overall, a great movie with great acting and writing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a great movie for a few reasons. I loved the social aspect the women had and how they all knew each other without really knowing each other. Another aspect I loved was how the woman came together no matter what and tried to help each other out from the problems in their love lives to their problems in the work place. This movie was a major turning point for women and this may very well have played a part with helping woman get their voices heard and given them the "okay" to go out and make a difference. The different personalities came together so well and made the movie work! All the different camera angles were great and I feel like it helped parallel all the different characters and story lines/ situations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Oh Those Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Women" is certainly an enjoyable film that draws from its two strengths: its excellent cast and its well written script. Without a single man in the cast, it is a very interesting movie. This is especially since men are main characters in discussion and important parts of the women's lives, but the relationships remain out of the camera's sight. The actresses are amazing and they feed off of each other no matter how exaggerated and catty they come off. Great acting is complemented by clever writing. There is a never ending stream of witty one-liners.The one downside of this movie is it tried to work in a darker storyline that just didn't work. Ideally, this movie would be all screwball comedy and the rhythm would not be broken by diversions that add nothing but disappointment. However, the movie can still be salvaged and is enjoyable.Visually, the movie is interesting because it is all black and white except for (in the version I watched) the Technicolor fashion show. It was surprising, to say the least.</fullReview>

It is the perfect film to grab popcorn or a Ben &amp;Jerry's and just nestle down on a comfy couch and just forget about men.This film was based off a Broadway show, so the story line is something amazing. All the women in this film showed a strong bond of friendship and everything else you would expect. This film is just an endless joy that any woman should have on their DVD shelf. It's funny and dramatic throughout the film.The black &amp; white color, and directorial shots, just made this film even more classical then when it first came out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Considering how busy George Cukor was in 1939 working on both epics, The Wizard of Oz and GWTW, this is another film showing the depth of Hollywood films that year. This film features a large female cast with a lot of the best actresses to the decade.It is a period piece to be sure as back when this was made, divorce was still considered taboo in many quarters. Women were not yet liberated at this point either. Even with those limits, women were still catty and their claws come out in this movie. About the only actresses missing here are the ones working on those epic films back during this time. If you scan the cast and click on any of these actresses, you will find one or more good film they starred in. It is rather amazing that Cukor was able to bring all of them together for one film.For it's era, the film tries to tackle the subject of divorce as best it can. This film looks at it from the womens perspective at that time. This is all before single motherhood &amp; tattooed, body pierced women become as common as they have today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This 1939 film is really a wonderful example of the last examples of the upper upper class prior to WWII. Most of key characters are very full of themselves and represent the kind of superiority that was about to disappear.Of course, the writing is superb (surprisingly the overall screenplay was improved by Anita Loos and Jane Murfin who had to change quite a bit from the original Clare Boothe hit play) There were a number of situations that would not passed the censors....they actually made some great improvements.Most of the performancesare absolutely first-rate.....except Norma Shearer's rather overly melodramatic performance, who at times seem to be in a different movie! Two of my favorite performances are by two of the lesser known actresses: Phyllis Povah is hysterical as Edith...what a great performance. Shame her career didn't include more good films. Same goes for Florence Nash as Nancy. Florence Nash is not as well known as her sister, Mary.Russell, Crawford, Goddard &amp; Boland are great, as usual. (Remember that Rosalund Russell's comedic performance in this movie really started to move her from playing second leads to becoming a major leading star.) Would she have been offered "His Girl Friday" if she hadn't gotten this part? I sincerely doubt it... Regardless of my comments about Shearer, everyone who loves movies of the 1930's should see this amazing film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you can get past the first few minutes of this over-produced and occasionally over-the-top adaptation of the Clare Booth Luce Broadway hit (set in what appears to be a space-age beauty salon), you may actually enjoy this sharp, savagely funny look at the female sex. Norma Shearer had what was probably her best film role as noble housewife Mary Haines, whose "friends" arrange to have her discover that her husband is cheating on her with a sexy shopgirl (a smart, lively performance from Joan Crawford). Rosalind Russell and Phyllis Povah provide the most fun as Shearer's ghastly friends; there are bright turns by Paulette Goddard as a knowing showgirl and Mary Boland as an aging divorcée; and excellent supporting work from Lucile Watson as Shearer's wise, plain-spoken mother; Florence Nash as an acerbic writer; Muriel Hutchison and Mary Cecil as the household help; and Dennie Moore as a gabby beautician. Joan Fontaine, as a mousy, unsophisticated young bride, is the film's only weak spot (mouth agape, she, at times, gives the impression of being mentally retarded). Shearer has a wonderful moment when she learns her ex-husband has remarried and goes off on a crying jag. A Technicolor fashion show appears out of nowhere midway through the film and temporarily slows things down (the movie was, after all, directed by George Cukor).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor's queenly classic 'The Women' is famous for a couple of reasons. First, there is not a single male actor in it, they are always just around the corner or on the other end of the telephone, and secondly, it was the first major Hollywood release that SHOULD have been played by a cast of men in drag.It's bitchy, occasionally saccharine, childish and gleefully satisfying in some of the casting. The star is Norma Shearer. I've always found her to be a bit dull but she suits this nice, too- good-to-be-true character well enough. In the end, though, when she turns bitchy like her pals, she is less convincing. Her performance is largely contrived and fake but that isn't so unusual in movies of the 1930s before Method acting released the inner neurotic and all that nonsense. 'The Women' is a typically adolescent romp so beloved of my parents' generation, the WW2 era. They wanted fantasy to take their minds off Hitler and Hirohito and Stalin, and tinsel town gave it to them in a number of classic flicks of this sort. 1939, the first year of the Second World War, was a bumper year. 'The Women' didn't stand a chance at the Oscars with 'Gone with the Wind', 'The Wizard of Oz', 'Ninotchka', and 'The Hunchback of Notre Dame' on the lists. But there are some great comic performances in it. Rosalind Russell is very funny as the catty gossip monger who jumps from her best friend status to Norma Shearer to that of Joan Crawford's sleazy slut, Crystal Allen, after Crystal seduces Norma Shearer's clearly weak-minded husband and marries him. All these women end up in Reno getting divorce-lites. Marjorie Main runs the 'dude' ranch for divorcees and she's up to her usual camp standards as she describes 'those brick-headed men.. (who) like to get right to the point.' Paulette Goddard has a nice girl fight with Rosalind Russell (who's husband Goddard has seduced), complete with hair pulling and clothing ripping. The ever-boring Joan Fontaine is the young wife who thinks her husband doesn't love her anymore (and no wonder, she's such a simpering nitwit) but suddenly discovers she pregnant, and in an especially nauseating scene calls him from Reno to tell him the news in the most sickening female baby-gushing ever to be seen in any movie. I hated her in this movie, and that's saying something. But that's what 'good' women lived for in those days, babies. The others, like Crystal Allen, live for bubble baths and orgasms.The real star of this movie comes in about halfway through in the glorious, plump personage of Mary Boland as the Countess de Lave, who is on her fourth husband and about to make off with Buck, the dude ranch hand. Boland gives the middle and end of this movie the kick in the bustle it needs as one tires of the schtick of the other women. I keep this movie in my collection simply for Mary Boland tossing herself distraught on to the nearest chaise-longue wailing 'La publicité!!' after a scandal in the nightclub back in New York when Buck has teamed himself up with Crystal Allen.There are also some wonderful character actresses who get most of the good lines.'The Women' isn't as great as people once thought, but it's still a fun, camp party flick.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabricated Hysteria</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clare Boothe was a brilliant woman; she married one of America's most successful men (Henry Luce, founder of Time-Life, Inc.). I've read her autobio. She had privilege, beauty and wealth. And her feet were firmly planted for most of her life. She was ambasadoress to Italy.In my critique of The Women, it's important to separate today's greater sophistication from 1937 or '38's simpler times. (The Women also had a successful Broadway run.) However, I'm not going to bother following that rule, because it's too restrictive.Brilliant dialogue, dramas and books long preceded The Women. Writers didn't have to make their points with one-dimensional characters, or near-slapstick hysteria. So why did she write a drama with such shallow, cliché characters? I have no quarrel with the storyline; it's linear in its simplicity: husband strays, wife sues for divorce, goes to Reno to establish residency, meets a gaggle of near-idiot friends, relatives and strangers; returns home to NYC, realizes that her husband is unhappy with the floozie that he married, and fights to gain him back. Roz Russell should have been locked up, she maintained such a borderline frenzied attitude; the Countess de la Whatever, easily 60 (and looked even older) was straight out of a whorehouse and with the libido of an alley cat; Paulette Goddard (smart enough to have married Charley Chaplin) always passing marital advice on to others, yet has her claws out to cat fight with Roz; Marjorie Maine (astonishingly pretty), housekeeper in Reno who sang at the top of her lungs with a voice like a parrot being strangled. --And, god, who else? Joan Crawford: already getting on some - being bitchy and manipulative.I didn't like The Women. It thought itself alarmingly funny, when it was more like the Marx bros. in drag. Anita Loos helped with the dialogue. Ms. Loos and Frances Marion were the kingpins of MGM's writers. Deservedly. But not for this over-baked, over-perfumed, heavy-handed romp. Loos gave us Lorili Lee (Gentlemen Prefer Blondes), so she was highly capable of complex characters and subtlety. The Women characters were like a clutch of actresses in orgasmic seizures when they delivered their lines. Norma Shearar, widow of Irving Thalberg, and almost always worthy of praise in her contemporary beauty, wasn't as peripatetic as the others, thank goodness. But, oh! that final party scene when the women throw Russell into a closet, then drag her out to confront her nemesis, was so over the top that one wanted to bury oneself under the couch cushion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women explores the tribulations and dilemmas of weather sleeping dogs should lie. Unless you're easily offended by a movie in which majority of its female cast are vicious gossips then stay away, although the gossiping stereotypes are greatly exaggerated, being all part of the film's humor. As Sylvia Fowler (Rosalind Russell) puts it, "you know how those creatures are, babble babble babble babble babble, never let up for a minute". That's probably the best way to describe The Women, like the other notable female ensemble Stage Door, the dialogue in The Women is delivered so furiously it's impossible to keep up with it, after all how many people can talk as fast as Rosalind Russell. Joan Crawford on the other hand is delightfully mean, particularly with her scene in the bathtub is so ridiculously villainous it's great, with the pairing of screen rival Norma Shearer being the closet thing at that point to a Baby Jane showdown in a battle of the egos. To choose the show stealer, it's a hard choice between Joan Crawford and Rosalind Russell. Myrna Loy and Greta Garbo where the only two major actresses at MGM who did not appear in the film. I can picture Myrna Loy in Norma Shear's role, although she would have been too big a star otherwise to play a supporting role, while Garbo is well, too much of an odd ball to fit in with an ensemble like this. Also being a heterosexual male this movie earns some bonus points.Although made into the era of the production code, several sexual references still manage to slip through ("Whatever Stephan doesn't like I take it off"), while also look out for the topless woman in the mud bath at the beginning of the film and Paulette Goddard's clear lack of a bra, no really. I also found it interesting when Norma Shear speaks of how she and her husband are equals and how things have changed from her mother's generation, this being in 1939 of course.This kind of being made today (which it unfortunately was) with the likes of the Sex and the City films, comes off as a ghastly exercise in consumerist pornography. But the overall innocence of the period makes The Women come of a piece of harmless escapism, even if it is one of the most decadent movies of the depression era, maybe even the most. Majority of the cast is dressed like a million dollars, every actress is light like a goddess and inhabiting a world which largely consists of retail stores and beauty salons. There is even time for a Technicolor fashion show. It has no relevance for the rest of the plot, but it looks pretty. With two hours of some of the finest actresses of the 1930's spewing nonstop machine gun fire dialogue, scenery chewing and competing for the camera's attention, I'm in movie heaven.</fullReview>

The pace of the movie was rather mixed: seemed overly speedy at first and drawn out toward the end, such as in the fashion show, but each pace served the tone of the scene and held the audience in the right frame of mind. Not only was the movie entertaining, but it had themes relevant to the era that are just as important today. The generational gap is obvious between Mrs. Haines and her mother, and they have opposite views on how to handle infidelity, a frequent subject tackled on the screen. Some of the things about marriage said by the mother remind me of how my grandmother has talked about divorce?certain things simply weren't done, yet are commonplace today, and this movie focuses on a turning point.

Firstly to Ivan22, you talk of "misanthropy" in this movie, well, that's rich from someone who is clearly a misogynist, you even question as to whether the script was really written by females!! Duh, guess no woman is capable of producing quality thoughts or scripts from our teensy weensy little girly brains. He appeared to hate the movie for all the wrong reasons, such as there being an all female cast. Well, buddy, there ain't no law against it, just as there are movies with all males casts and you don't see any of us girls commenting against that. And a little point to Mame who commented that the film was old fashioned. Yes dear, perhaps it is by today's standards, but, the fact that it was in black and white and starred a young Joan Crawford and Roz Russell should give you a clue that it is 64 years old and, yes, the times they have a changed since then, most of us are aware of that and just enjoy the movie for the delicious pleasure that it is.

As has been pointed out in previous comments, she has several "silent movie" moments, especially that "head up, arms out" closing scene. Although Shearer is quite good--especially for Shearer--the movie would have been even better with Irene Dunne as Mary Haines. The next time you watch "The Women," try to visualize Dunne in the role--she would have been perfect with her lighter-than-air delivery of dialogue.</fullReview>

During that time, she constantly complained that all the good roles went to Norma Shearer, wife of M-G-M producer, Irving Thalberg. "How can I compete with Norma when she sleeps with the boss?" Joan reportedly complained. Needless to say, Joan had a "chip on her shoulder" when it came to subject of Norma Shearer. In 1939, the two were cast in "The Women," and the animosity they obviously felt towards one another adds sparks to their scenes.</fullReview>

Although there are many wonderful actresses today, few would qualify to deliver the razor sharp wit of the original movie. However......I think Julia Roberts, Reece Witherspoon, Renee Zellweger and Kirsten Dunst could qualify for an American version.Thinking of English actresses, you would be spoiled for choice. Shame Maggie Smith and Dame Judi Dench are out of the age group for most roles, because they would eat them for breakfast.Does anybody else have any candidates for nomination?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The women talk and talk and talk. While they say some interesting things now and then, one has to put up with a lot of noise to catch little bits of wisdom. Despite her reputation as a less-than-subtle actress, Shearer gives a pretty good performance for the most part (the last shot of her is ridiculously bad but the blame for this must go to Cukor, an overrated director). Instead of Shearer, it is Crawford and Russell who overact. Goddard is sexy and effective as a sassy divorcée; it would have been better to have her in the Crawford role. As the film is too long to begin with, the superfluous fashion interlude doesn't help matters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like this film, except for Marjorie Main singing...enough!! we get it!! One more note and I was going to turn the thing off.These early WWII movies are interesting. Did the movie going public really think RICH people were so wonderful, so much to be envied and copied or whatever? The furs, the affects, the wise mothers and the perfect little girls...give me a break! If the public were really dumb enough to believe that's how the "other class" lived, Hitler would be running our country now. Whose idea was such a portrayal? Parts of this movie are barfable.But what the heck. If you don't have diabetes you can tolerate it. The stereotypes, the absolute sweetness of the good women, the evil of the "bad" women, it's all here. It is escapism, that's for sure.A fun movie in any case.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entirely petty movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though it is perhaps worth seeing because of the range of Hollywood leading ladies that star in it, I found The Women (1939) to encompass all of the most petty and disagreeable sides of the female psyche. Which made for a mostly grueling and un-enjoyable watching experience. Though the cast is comprised entirely of more mature women (albeit some slightly younger ones), the movie's dialogue is almost never anything but catty. Though the dialogue is admittedly "tight" it never espouses anything of value to the audience and high-jinks aimed at putting other women down are tiring. Few of the women in the movie are portrayed as having lives of their own, and ten minutes of watching bored housewives do strange aerobic 30s-styled exercises.... was ten minutes too long. The movie's entire premise was depressing and in my eyes entirely dull. Watching women exercises and gossip for two hours is draining, I wouldn't recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does this movie look familiar?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This story was remade. The 1956 feature The Opposite Sex with June Allyson and Joan Collins is the same story. The 1956 version features Dick Shawn dancing around his many girlfriends on stage. The Opposite Sex also features Leslie Nielsen as the philandering husband. Also look for Don Backus. The Countess is played by Agnes Moorehead. Ann Miller is also one of the prospective divorce es on the way to Reno. The film also features a cameo by Clare Booth Luce the author of the original play. My wife spotted the similarities in the films. Joan Crawford and Joan Collins playing the same character appears to be a stretch, but Joan Crawford was not quite so witch-like in 1939.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The claws are out and the verbal fight is on...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE WOMEN is based on Clare Booth Luce's famous Broadway play and turned into a star-laden film for some of Hollywood's biggest "dames": NORMA SHEARER (MGM's top star and a bit too 'grand dame' for the role of Mary Haines), ROSALIND RUSSELL (as a vicious gossiper, Sylvia), JOAN CRAWFORD as the tough mantrap Crystal, PAULETTE GODDARD (as the sassy Miriam, who confronts Russell in one of the film's best scenes), JOAN FONTAINE, as the demure Peggy, and MARY BOLAND (outmugging everyone in the cast as the Countess DeLave). Several other lesser MGM contract players are also on hand, including RUTH HUSSEY in a throwaway role and reliable MARJORIE MAIN.The trouble is, it goes on for 133 minutes with the women getting bitchier by the second--and though they all act as though their role in life is defined by men, there's not a single male in the film, all eyes meant to concentrate on these silly and highly charged women with nothing on their mind but the battle of the sexes.After the first hour, it gets a bit wearying--and tedious--until the confrontations between Shearer and Crawford steam things up a little, and then the verbal spars turn physical when Russell and Goddard begin their assault tactics. But it's a film aimed primarily at women--about women--and for women.George Cukor is in his element directing this type of barnyard squabble, some of which is pretty syrupy at the start. The opening scenes with NORMA SHEARER and VIRGINIA WEIDLER are cloying, to say the least. And Shearer doesn't miss a theatrical gesture in just about every scene she plays.Recommended for star gazers of the Golden Age who enjoy watching these women at work.</fullReview>
