		<fullReview>Remakes are usually a bad idea. Musical remakes are usually a VERY bad idea. Case in point: "The Women," in its original 1939 form, is a certified classic of brittle bitchiness and acidic wit. Moreover, it also happens to be very, very funny. "The Opposite Sex," its 1956 Technicolor incarnation, is witless and brainless, and also happens to be very, very funny--unintentionally. Mistake number one was remaking such a lauded film in the first place; mistake number two was adding men to the cast (the original was entirely female--down to the authors of the books in library scenes); and mistake number three was including ludicrous song and dance numbers. Mistakes number four and five, respectively, are June Allyson and Joan Collins, subbing for Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford. Allyson's wholesome persona actually isn't too bad for the role, but she can't act her way out of a paper bag. Collins, on the other hand, is glorious to look at, but has none of the bite and venom that Crawford brought to the table (obviously, by the time "Dynasty" came along, Collins had learned her lessons well). Ann Miller pinch hits for Paulette Goddard, and is her usual sassy self; but why is she not dancing in this so-called musical? The divine Dolores Gray comes off best as the catty Sylvia; where Rosalind Russell played her as a shrieking harpy, Dolores prefers a silkier approach. If she doesn't approach the virtuosity of Russell's performance, Gray at least injects some sorely-needed sophisticated bitchery to the proceedings. Finally, there's the ever-dependable Joan Blondell (although the fact that post-menopausal Blondell is supposed to be constantly pregnant tests one's suspension of disbelief) and an incredibly butch-looking Ann Sheridan, several years past her "Tobacco Road" prime. Really, there are two prime reasons to watch this mess: the insanely phallic calypso musical extravaganza, and the gloriously gaudy fashion show that the ladies put on for nearly 2 dizzying hours. Those looking for Clare Booth Luce's marvelous wit, look elsewhere. For those looking for glamorous, campy entertainment with no thought required--pop this baby in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say I am baffled by the trashing of this film. Are we watching the same movie? I have watched both The Women and The Opposite Sex, all within the span of a week on Turner Classic and though the Women was cleverer, The Opposite Sex was not really in the "Chopped Liver" category either.Yes, it's true. Given a choice, I would rather watch The Women too.But the Opposite Sex has adequate acting, women in gorgeous gowns and sticks quite faithfully to the original story-line whereby the 1st Wife gets her revenge against the 2nd wife. Who doesn't love the lucked-out-housewife-wins-the-day-story-line? I know I do.And I do enjoy looking at Jeff Richards as the hunky singing cowboy, Buck.If you have the time, why not check it out yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why? More importantly, WHY???</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At nearly every turn, you'll hear the same thing, repeated ad nauseum: "Why can't Hollywood come up with something original?" If you think that sentiment is something new for this generation, all you need do is catch this the next time it's on Turner Classic Movies (or on DVD) and you'll discover a lack of originality is hardly New Age. MGM, for whatever reason, apparently decided to remake one of THE classic comedies of ANY age, let alone the 1930's, Clare Boothe Luce's "The Women", directed by George Cukor (perhaps the best director of women ever) starring Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, veteran scene-stealer Rosalind Russell, and a whole crew of other very talented actresses. In the original, as it is already well-known, men may have been the topic of every conversation but NEVER were they shown on-screen (right down to the books, all written by women). The writing was arguably the crispest, sharpest, wittiest, played to the nth degree by a sterling cast and guided by peerless direction. Alas, in this remake, you get none of that. It's hard, really, to begin to say just WHERE the problem lies, but I'll start with the mildest offender: the men, absent on-screen in the original, are now on display for all to see and this twist does little, if anything, to help. Oh, sure: Leslie Nielsen is quite a hunk and does as well as anyone probably could with such a one-dimensional character, but he is the ONLY male to make any impact whatsoever, apart from Jeff Richards, who plays Buck, an ambitious country singer who's more than willing to help divorcees-in-the-making get over their pains: Richards is totally bland as can be, with a hilariously inept "southern" accent to boot. Then there's the direction: where's George Cukor when you need him?!?!? David Miller, as one look at his list of directorial duties will immediately make clear, wasn't exactly a Golden Boy when it came to helming films; save for two or three films, none of the movies he helped bring to the screen can even come close to being called "classics" and most are probably well-forgotten, a batting average well on display here, for the film as a whole is just THERE, rudderless and bereft of a sure hand. The screenplay also takes a handful of liberties with Clare Boothe Luce's classic, throwing in some "modern" twists and changing things about, here and there, and the effect is lethal. (Characters are melded into one, or used sparingly, or cut entirely.) And then there's the music - oh, the music! Oddly, though this is, officially, a musical, there really isn't much music to be found, which, judging by what music IS offered, ain't such a terrible thing: in a song-within-a-play number, Dick Shawn oversells it all, practically knocking the audience over the head; in another number, Joan Collins, as the man-stealing hussy once played by Joan Crawford, is asked to do the simplest dance moves and is as stiff as a board (it's a hoot!); the aforementioned Jeff Richards also offers up a number, the unforgettable "Rock and Roll Tumbleweed", the title of which provides you with all you need to know. The worst, though, is the film's star, June Allyson, whose husky voice seems perpetually off-key in EVERY tune. Allyson is also a major liability in other aspects: while I'm sure she's the sweetest person in real life, she was NEVER a very good actress, and CERTAINLY all wrong for the role of a goody-two-shoes wife whose husband leaves her for another, more exciting woman, a role originally portrayed by Norma Shearer. Where Shearer added bite to her performance, Allyson smiles stoically and offers moist eyes to the heavens, as if expecting a halo to suddenly appear atop her head, a head already bedecked with a severe, matronly 'do that is NOT flattering to a woman who's too old for the part to begin with (and if Allyson WASN'T too old for the part, well, honey, she LOOKS it!). Also a sore disappointment is Joan Collins, already type-cast, perhaps, as a tart, but those expecting "Dynasty"-style bitchiness should look elsewhere: Collins is a novice, and, while physically stunning, is too much the novice to really sink her teeth into the dialogue, which she rushes through as if she has somewhere else to be. She tries but it's no cigar. No cigar, indeed! Ann Sheridan is sympathetic as Allyson's truest friend but she's given almost nothing to do except look as butch as possible. (She's probably supposed to be an amalgamation of Shearer's mother and the "old maid" - read: lesbian - columnist from the original.) Joan Blondell is a welcome sight as the ever-pregnant friend but as another reviewer has so adeptly noticed, she's also a bit long-in-the-tooth for her role. Ann Miller, in the Paulette Goddard role, and Agnes Moorehead, as the Countess, do as well as they can, and aren't bad, really, but are really also given very little to do; in the case of Miller, it's mind-boggling WHY, in a musical, of all things, she's just there to model clothes. Only Dolores Gray, as sniveling weasel Sylvia Fowler, comes close to reaching the level expected by fans of "The Women", but she's still at a loss, thanks to a terrible script and fellow performers who just aren't up to the task. A director who doesn't care, stars woefully miscast, laughable musical moments, and an interminable pace all spell disaster. The only worthwhile aspect of sitting through it is as a period piece, a curiosity piece, a campy number or two, and to see a pre-"Dynasty" Joan Collins. Otherwise, a two-hour snooze-fest. You've been warned.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a missed opportunity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of The Women (1939) misses the boat for two main reasons - 1. it's too nice. Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen was far more acidic than Joan Collins' sweet little version 2. it casts loads of talented musical performers - and doesn't use them! Ann Miller, Joan Blondell, Ann Sheridan, Doleres Gray - all wasted. June Allyson is miscast as Kay Hilliard, a little long in the tooth for all this.(Incidentally interesting to see Blondell and Allyson in the same film, considering their shared marital history off-screen as successive wives to Dick Powell).Pros - the musical numbers aren't bad, if a bit on the camp side; it features a fashion parade throughout to die for; it's colourful.Otherwise it rips off the original, adds songs and men, and messes the whole thing up. It's watchable, but Norma, Joan, Paulette, and Rosalind will remain the standard for this particular story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Women" is one of the true treasures of old black &amp; white movies.There was not one role miscast and the snappy,witty script has not been duplicated in another all female movie and still holds up today!That said this movie is 100% miscast,misdirected and the script is dull &amp; flat even though it includes many lines from the original play &amp; movie.I really felt sorry for Ann Miller,wasted in the Paulette Goddard role who neither gets to sing nor dance in this musical remake! While the tone-deaf, off-key June Allyson(Norma Shearer she ain't) gets to sing a few songs while having no chemistry with Leslie.Another thing, who the heck decided to let the Sylvia Fowler character played here by Delores Gray and in 1939 by Rosalind Russell,hook-up with Buck Winston instead of the Countess played by Agnes Moorehead? Another great actress was wasted in her part along with Joan Blondell and Gray too for that matter.I agree with all previous comments that adding men did nothing and actually helped make a dull film duller if that's possible.Skip this tin horror and go for the 1939 gold medal original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a waste of talent! Shame on MGM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>June Allyson's last MGM musical had to go back to a 40's film she starred in for its best number, though they sure tried hard to make a hit out of "Now, Baby, Now" - except Allyson isn't the sexy dancer the song called for. And Ann Miller never gets to sing or dance a step. Dolores Gray, used well in "It's Always Fair Weather" and "Kismet" (She single-handedly saves that one), gets to sing the title song over the credits, and nothing else. The useless male guest stars get half the songs and butcher them. The original script had it right - keep the guys off screen. Where was the creative talent that could have pulled the plug on this one or whipped it up into a reasonable shape?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women Behaving Badly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No need to compare this stand-alone with the original. MGM's wardrobe department must have worked overtime. The ladies-- and there are many-- get to model all the high fashion of 1956, and some outfits are real doozies. But then this is a tell-all musical remake about sophisticated Manhattan show people from influential author Luce who certainly should know. You may need a scorecard, however, to keep up with the rotating relationships among the high class types. I expect the film sets feminist teeth on edge now with its depiction of women as either maliciously catty (Gray &amp; Collins) or catty as a defensive measure (Allyson, Blondell, &amp; Sheridan). And that's when they're not chasing after men on whom it appears they're emotionally dependent. I imagine that if the movie were made today, key changes would be made.That's not to say this Technicolor candy box isn't entertaining. It is at least campy fun, although the musical numbers are mostly forgettable. Instead, it's the characters that are irresistible, particularly Gray as the queen of acid gossip; Collins as the ruthless husband stealer; and Richards as the dude ranch stud. It's also a well-honed supporting cast, down to a blondined henchwoman Carolyn Jones. Unfortunately, it's also a rather dour June Allyson, a long way from her usual verve and sparkle. But the high-point may well be the biggest no-holds-barred brawl between two women (Miller and Gray) that I've seen. Stand aside John Wayne and the rest of the macho brawlers because this one is worthy of the best smoke-filled bar room. I don't know if stunt doubles filled in, but somebody deserved a fat paycheck. Anyway, if you don't mind seeing women behaving badly 1950's style, this well-upholstered confection deserves a look-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a terrible remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1950's version of the 1930's "The Women" was updated quite a bit. The ideals of the 1950's show up, along with the new male characters (who were never seen in the original)and the fashion.Actually, while "The Women" is dated, too, the dialog is sharper and the characters much more fun. Joan Crawford beats Joan Collins easily as the vamp, and Rosalind Russell eats up scenery. Of course, Leslie Nelson back in his hunky leading man days is plenty of fun. This version is a little more moralistic, with more hand wringing and melodramatic action. And the addition of the male characters really isn't that much of a plus. Sometimes the comic action is overboard.All in all, not a bad movie, but if you really want to see action, catch "The Women" instead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fabulous!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK. It isn't "The Women" but a very close runner-up. I think the casting for this film was fantastic. June Alyson is good - I do think her character of Kay could have probably been cast better. Also, the daughter is just a little to happy happy in this film...sort of annoying. Unlike "The Women" which is SO fast paced - you almost have to watch it more than once to understand connections. The Opposite Sex delivers the same humor and "venom" as it were between these women in a much slower paced and fashionable way. I think the musical numbers are cute - very 50's. The costumes/gowns are excellent..especially Kay's last gown in the Starlight Room...just fabulous! Of course it's the 50's - color films of the 50's are always great to watch and so vivid! I truly think it is difficult to compare this to The Women. I feel it's not about one being better than the other. They are too different to compare as they both have many advantages and are absolutely delightful.Hello! Release this on DVD please!!!! Amazon should offer this boxed together with The Women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such an inexplicable disappointment-----</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I, as many others here, was excited to learn of, and anxious to see this "musical remake" of The Women. But as my summary states, I found it to be such an inexplicable disappointment! Others here have said it better, so I'll just echo the complete bafflement of having stars of the caliber of Joan Greenwood and Ann Miller DO NOTHING AT ALL in the film! Amazing and so disappointing.I'm afraid the root cause of this bomb is the choice of June Alyson for the lead. Frankly, Norma Shearer grates on me; I do not worship at her altar; however, she certainly brought enough depth of character to the original wonderful 1930s film to justify all the shenanigans of that film, which all revolved around her. What she did, what she didn't do, how she reacted, etc. In this sorry remake, that character as played by June Alyson is so boringly uninteresting. We can't see at all that the character's friends would react with such concern. Who cares is more the response given. And lets get this over with.The pacing was excruciatingly slow and flat. The "humor" was pathetic. The pathos was humorous. And as has been pointed out, why? Why even call this thing a musical? In the '30s and '40s, there was often one or two musical "entertainments" worked into the film as incidentals or backgrounds, but that didn't justify calling them musicals! Yes, I'm afraid that this piece definitely needed a different more dynamic lead, and it also needed a much better director and/or editor to pick up the pace.So disappointing. I can't even recommend it for the "period" costumes....though I must comment they were so "stunning" as to all seem like stage costumes! Boo-hoo. I thought I had discovered a new treasure to enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They could have skipped the men but still entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having liked but not loved the original, although the cast was peerless, I found this revamp to be a decent view. Even though they should have left out the men and a few songs they still gathered together a terrific collection of actresses. All stand out in their own way with Ann Sheridan, a chic, knowing observer. Joan Collins is incredibly beautiful even if she plays a grasping tramp. Agnes Moorehead, Delores Gray, that's her singing the title tune, and Ann Miller all have flashy overdressed parts and they make the most of them. The real dynamic to watch out for is between June Allyson and Joan Blondell, they had both been married to Dick Powell-Joan first and then supposedly June snatched him away, who here play boon companions but in actuality spoke only on screen and avoided each other like the plague off. It's a testament to their skill and professionalism that they seem the best of chums. Missing the Cukor touch there is still much to entertain here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies since I was a kid. The bad reviews it gets here blow my mind. The cast was excellent in my opinion and the adding of the men unlike "The Woman" is great to me. Leslie Nielson is crazy hot and so is the guy who plays Buck. Also Joan Collins is indescribably hotter than Joan Crawford as Crystal Allen and fits the part perfect. Another question for me is who doesn't think June Allyson is adorable and The Countess is wonderful?? This is obviously one of those movies that you should see for yourself and make your own opinion because they vary drastically from person to person. Me my two sisters, my mother &amp; my Grandmother have loved this movie our whole lives!! The remake of The Woman most recently (2008) is what was ridiculous and not worth watching, I mean they made The Countess a pothead and they wrote Meg Ryans part as just a pathetic female with no life or goals!!! Now thats a sad reproduction!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The opposite effect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whoever thought a semi-musical remake of the classic George Cukor's film "The Women" was a good idea, didn't' think this misguided attempt was going to stand the passing of time. Alas, "The Opposite Sex" is a sad reminder not to try to do what already has been done, much better.We had no inkling this was a remake when we watched a clip in the coming attractions shown by TCM recently. This 1956 MGM film, directed by David Miller, based on the screen play by Fay and Michael Kanin, seems to be a bad dream.It's obvious, from the start, this is a bad adaptation of Clare Boothe Luce's play of the thirties when the voice over tells us there are millions of men in the island of Manhattan surrounded by strong women. Right away we meet Sylvia Fowler, who retained her name from the previous movie, as she is dishing with the manicurist Olga. As the name of Crystal Allen is heard, we knew what we were in for, because that is a classic name for one of the best known gold diggers of the thirties.While "The Women" is light and fun, this installment, is obvious and heavy. There is also the problem of the men one sees throughout. In the earlier film we didn't get to see any! The story line has been kept, but in a way, it doesn't make much sense, as it shows it hasn't kept as well as the original.June Allyson is Kay Hilliard. In a way, this woman jumps the gun in getting a divorce instead of fighting for her man, if she loved him at all. Of course, Ms. Luce's play was written that way, otherwise there wouldn't be a reason for the side trip to Reno, and the eventual reconciliation. Ms. Allyson was a bland presence in the films she appeared. She was always the good one who would sacrifice everything.Dolores Gray is the bitchy Sylvia Fowler, the one that starts things going. Joan Blondell is the sweet Edith, the perennial mother, the only happily married woman of the lot. Ann Sheridan plays the sophisticated Amanda, Kay's true friend. Agnes Moorehead has some good moments as the Countess. Joan Collins as Crystal is not too effective in the film, as she hadn't refined her act as a villainess yet. Ann Miller is good as Gloria.The supporting roles were fine, but they don't have much to do. A young Leslie Nielsen is Steve Hilliard. Carolyn Jones, Alice Pearce, Sam Levene, Bill Goodwin, Charlotte Greenwood, have good moments.Our suggestion: Watch the original!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE OPPOSITE SEX is a product of the 50's. And it's quite grand. Why so many people dismiss this movie is a mystery to me. No, it's not SINGIN IN THE RAIN; AN AMERICN IN Paris; THE BANDWAGON etc...but it IS entertaining. In fact, it's not really a musical comedy. It's more of comedy with music as no one starts singing or dancing in the middle of a scene. All the musical numbers are in "performance" mode. I think this is more of a realistic aspect than the original THE WOMEN that this film is based and up-dated upon. Who ever heard of a film with no men. In THE WOMEN, the entire cast, including a bartender, a driver etc...are all played by women. Quite odd. Anyway, this loose remake is lot's of fun. Nice color, wide screen and a good cast. JUNE ALLYSON is just fine in her role as is JOAN COLLINS. The real stand outs are AGNES MOOREHEAD (isn't she always?), DOLORES GRAY and ANN SHERIDAN. Just wish SHERIDAN had more to do. Enjoy this for what it's worth. Just a good, fun time, not to be taken very seriously. The fact that LESLIE NEILSEN marries the JOAN COLLINS character is the most implausible aspect of the entire film. He already knows what a B---H she is and he still loves his wife...so the marriage doesn't make sense. But of course if they didn't marry there would be no Act 111. Nice that this movie is now available on DVD thru Warner Archives or by rental from CLASSIC FLIX. See another great film of it's time and era as well...MEET ME IN LAS VEGAS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie only a few days ago on TCM. I thought the women were wonderful. I'm an especially fond of Dalores Gray, did I say fond, I'm in love; she is fantastic looking and what a voice, although it is not used in this picture, except over the titles. Agnes Moorehead is also a looker. I seem to go for the hard faced type. June Allyson as the lead is not very good, compared to the other women including Ann Miller she is dull. The outfits the women wear are are great yet so implausible. In every scene, a different dress, this film is more a fashion parade of the 50's, than a true musical. Jeff Richards plays the cowboy flirt well and has a song of his own although I not sure if his own voice is used. But for me this movies main delight is Dalores Gray. I am surprised how few films she made, yet in each she made an outstanding impact. I didn't realize just how long Jone Collins has been around. I thought she played the gold digger perfectly. www.basildoneye.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Plush musical remake of 1939's "The Women", which in turn was based on Clare Booth Luce's catty play, about gossiping females in New York City getting involved in each other's love lives. Artificial fluff with a good cast (this time including males as well), but completely disposable and unmemorable, never offering up anything substantial. There's an unnecessary Broadway sub-plot shoehorned in as an excuse to feature several songs, and the script is arranged carefully so that each well-dressed lady gets a choice moment in the spotlight. June Allyson, playing the put-upon wife of Leslie Nielsen (!), gives the movie's best performance, although Joan Collins and Ann Miller certainly get their licks in. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very good remake of The Women by MGM. There is as much to like in it, if not more, than the original. For a few good reasons:First, this version works because of the musical numbers. June Allyson has inherited the Norma Shearer role. She proves, with the exception of Janet Leigh, that she is the studio's perfect type for this sort of part. She gives it an added flair, due to her abilities as a dancer.Second, the film works because it has Joan Collins, on loan from 20th Century Fox, in the old Joan Crawford role. Miss Collins definitely resembles Miss Crawford, and she is a logical successor here. But third, and most of all, this version works because it includes the men. Besides the music and the talented female leads, it gives us Leslie Nielsen as Stephen, the guy who finds himself caught between Allyson and Collins. What an enviable position that is to be in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's corny and campy--a technicolor fashion show! June Allyson dons a strapless tomato red gown to steal her husband back from sexy predator "Crystal," played by Joan Collins. But it's the hairstyle June should work on. Her flat, little-girl hair looks ridiculous, especially with her gravelly voice. Leslie Neilson plays the straying husband. He's extremely bland, has no charisma and bears no resemblance to the brilliant comic actor he later became. Even Joan Collins gets bored and starts two-timing him! She has a private telephone in her glamorous bathroom for clandestine phone conversations with other men. Can't say I blame her. June is annoying as the virtuous wife. The hats, the gloves, the fur pieces around the neck and the jewelry are fun to look at, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>why is everyone trashing this movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know why so many people on here are trashing this film. Is it a classic movie, no. But is it so awful, no. It is a perfectly good, entertaining movie. I think Allyson, the perfect 50's movie wife, is cast well as Kay, who is a perfect wife who gets left. I thought it was a little inside 50s joke, here is the perfect wife being left. Anyway, she is good and yes she was not 20, but it is a wife role and her daughter is about 10. It is not a young woman's part, that is the whole point; the husband leaves her for a younger woman. Ann Miller, Agnes Moorehead, Ann Sheridan, Dolores Gray, Joan Collins are all great. Does Miller sing or dance, no. But maybe someone was thinking she was a good actress and funny with lines and could be in a movie and not tap dance. I am sure she was happy to be cast as an actress for once. She was always a very funny performer. So check the movie out for yourself, it is really pretty good (and nice to see Allyson in some pretty clothes after all those years of white blouses in movies).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you like comfortable 1950s movies, you'll enjoy this. Nothing earth-shattering here, but the colorful high-fashion clothes and weird casting are fun to watch, in a campy way. You've never seen so much enormous sparkling jewelry in your life! June Allison is goody-two-shoes boring as usual, but Delores Grey and Agnes Morehead are great. Joan Collins isn't quite there yet, she's not as twisted as she was in the 80s. And it's impossible to take your eyes off of Ann Miller, gorgeous girl, she energizes every scene she's in. The guys in the film are all quite forgettable. So are the musical numbers. Watch it for the 50s styles and you'll have fun.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No great improvement on "The Women"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a film called "The Men", dealing with heterosexual love and romance but with an all-male cast. The wives, girlfriends and mistresses of the men are often referred to but never actually seen on screen. What, I wonder, would be the reaction of the critics? I suspect that they would simply dismiss this as a ridiculous idea. As if you could make a film about the relationship between the sexes without showing the female half of the equation! Yet when the gender-roles are reversed, the result is a marvellous classic of the cinema. That isn't, admittedly, my opinion of "The Women", but it seems to be the opinion of most reviewers on this board who regard George Cukor's 1939 comedy with such reverence that any attempt to remake it is almost blasphemous. Hence a lot of the bile directed at "The Opposite Sex" on here. It also seems to have been the opinion of some reviewers in 1956 and also of cinema-goers; it made a loss at the box-office. Unlike some so-called "remakes", this one follows the original plot fairly closely. The main character, here called Kay Hilliard, appears to be happily married, but her husband Steven is actually having an affair with a young woman named Crystal Allen. They say that in such situations the wife is always the last to know, and so it proves, but as Kay has the sort of friends who (in the words of the song) "just can't wait to bring all of that bad news to her door", the interval between the rest of the world knowing and her finding out herself is only a short one. Kay travels to Reno (then the divorce capital of America) to obtain a divorce, but soon starts to regret her decision. The film is mentioned in Esther Williams' autobiography, "The Million Dollar Mermaid". Apparently Dore Schary, studio head of MGM, wanted to cast Williams as Kay, but she refused, leading to her suspension from the studio. The film is hardly a masterpiece, but it does not fall so far below the artistic standards of the average Esther Williams movie (and most of them were pretty cheesy) to make worthwhile the loss of the $3 million in deferred contract payments which (according to her) she forfeited through her obstinacy. I wonder, however, how the film might have turned out had Esther ("Wet she's a star, dry she ain't!") accepted the role? Would it have been an extravagant water ballet with Kay a former Olympic swimming champion and her scandal-mongering friends all members of the same swimming club, ending with a massive cat- fight between Kay and Crystal in the deep end of the pool? (That might have been worth seeing!) As things were, however, June Allyson ("Dry she's a star, wet she ain't!") obviously lacked Esther's aquatic talents, so the film was made as the sort of semi-musical in which the characters sing, but only in situations where people sing in real life, so Kay becomes a retired singer who makes a comeback after her divorce, Steven a Broadway producer and Crystal a showgirl in one of his productions. So is this film better or worse than "The Women"? Well, in some areas the original is definitely superior. Norma Shearer was quite good as the Kay character (called Mary in the original), but Allyson is just dull and stodgy, making it all too easy for the audience to understand why Steven wanted to be rid of her. (Less easy to understand why he wanted her back). The child-star Virginia Weidler was enchanting as Little Mary, but Sandy Descher as the equivalent character, Debbie, is less so. In other respects, however, "The Opposite Sex" is better. It dispenses with the gimmick (dating back to Clare Boothe Luce's 1936 play) of an all-female cast in a story which is as much about men as it is about women, and it includes male actors who portray the husbands and boyfriends, notably Steven and Buck Winston, the handsome young cowboy who plays an important role in developments subsequent to Kay's divorce. It tones down the rather bitchy, misogynistic tone of the original, a film devoted to the proposition that every woman's worst enemy is another woman, often her so-called best friend. It also dispenses with the figure of Kay/Mary's cynical, worldly-wise old mother and replaces her with the more sympathetic Amanda, Kay's one true friend. Joan Collins is a lot better as the seductive Crystal than was that other Joan C, Crawford, who was too old for the role by about a decade and looked horribly miscast. Some have complained that Crystal is not as archly scheming as later Collins creations such as Alexis in "Dynasty", but she is not really a character of that sort. If you like she is what Alexis was before she became Alexis, a stunning young woman who does not need to scheme very hard to get what she wants because she can just rely on her looks. Dolores Gray is also better as the spiteful Sylvia Fowler than was the annoying motormouth Rosalind Russell, who played Sylvia as though she were a contestant in the World Speed-Talking Championships. On the debit side, there seems little point in remaking a non-musical film as a musical if the songs are as dull and forgettable as they are here. Nor is there much point in introducing male characters if the actors who play them are as dull and forgettable as the songs. In my view "The Women" was no classic but a mediocre film which left plenty of room for improvement when it was remade. Unfortunately, the makers of "The Opposite Sex" failed to capitalise on that room. 5/10 (the same mark as I gave to "The Women").</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glorious costumes. The rest ill-conceived.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you just want to look at an array of stunning gowns, this will fulfill your expectations. The film isn't as boring as some of the reviews suggest and the female stars make it almost worthwhile, especially in the Reno scenes. (Is this a spoiler? Is there anyone who hasn't seen The Women?) All I could think while watching it was that June Allyson must have bought the rights as a personal vehicle, because she has all the songs, although not one of them is memorable. Why cast Ann Miller, Dolores Gray, Charlotte Greenwood, Sam Levene, and Joan Blondell and not provide them with even one number? Especially Gray and Miller. The adaptation never commits itself to being a musical, and instead sticks in a few songs (Dick Shawn has a solo?) that don't further the plot but stop it dead. The Women is actually moving at times, despite its dated cattiness, but this skates by too superficially to make you care.</fullReview>

THE OPPOSITE SEX is sort of like a husband-swapping club, circa 1956, complete with a Reno Dudette ranch where rich soon-to-be ex-wives have 42 days to try out the latest in Boy Toys if they are caught between Sugar Daddies. High Society is so exclusive that social climbing is virtually impossible, as the "Crystal" character finds out here. Even though Crystal spends most of THE OPPOSITE SEX in various bath tubs, she cannot clean the dirt of her humble origins from her soul. At least that seems to be the main message of this so-called "women's film," in which the Rich Bi*Ches run an exclusive guild which quickly isolates and destroys any would-be gate-crashers, such as Crystal. The Ladies Powder Room is run more like a Texas slaughterhouse. Take it from me (and I toured one in Abilene): THE OPPOSITE SEX is NOT for weak stomachs; you may not like seeing how they make sausage. But for the braver gals, it's loads of fun!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Apathetic musical remake of 1939 classic The Women. Despite addition of songs and technicolor it actually winds up being less interesting than the original. If anything the 1950s trappings hurt the film. '50s films often had a stuffiness about them, due to the conservative fashions I suppose. Anyway this one has an OK cast but it's not a patch on the original. Ann Sheridan and Joan Blondell, two of my faves, were past their primes by 1956 unfortunately. Still, Sheridan probably stands out most of this cast. June Allyson is not an actress I was ever very big on and that opinion doesn't change with this performance. And what was with that terrible makeup they had her wearing in the second half of this movie? Yuck. Joan Collins gets the juiciest role here. The same role Joan Crawford did so well at in the 1939 film. Well I think just stating the obvious -- that Joan Collins is no Joan Crawford -- should suffice as a criticism. In short this is a bland remake of a very good film. See it for the assembled stars and curiosity factor but do yourself a favor and see The Women first.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As entertaining as this is (and remarkably well cast although a few talents are greatly wasted), when you compare this to the original screen version of "The Women", you just have to ask yourself "why?". There's a bit of irony in this though which makes it more a curiosity piece considering some of the casting, particularly two Mrs. Dick Powell's, the former (Joan Blondell) and the current (June Allyson), sharing a few scenes as social acquaintances yet not the best of friends. Allyson has taken over the Mary Haines role and now she is a former nightclub singer who gave it all up to marry Leslie Nielsen ("Shirley, you can't be serious!") and raise their daughter. He is bored and takes up with Joan Collins' Crystal Allen (Ironic considering her rivalry with Krystal on "Dynasty"), a showgirl who is roommates with the future Morticia Adams and briefly Mrs. Aaron Spelling (Carolyn Jones) and performs with her in a musical revue that gives the pregnant Blondell morning sickness after eating a huge banana split and having to view the tacky production number "Trees de Banana".If that isn't enough, there's future "Depends" commercial star Allyson singing a song called "Cling to Me" in a horrid looking pants suit (of course complete with "Peter Pan Collar"). At least she gets to reprise "The Young Man With a Horn" as she had in 1944's "Two Girls and a Sailor", once again accompanied by Harry James on his trumpet. Dick Shawn joins Collins, Jones and Jim Backus in the tacky title song in which Backus gets to be amusing giving us his Thurston Howell/Mr. Magoo laugh. Dolores Gray, singing the title song over the opening credits, takes on the Rosalind Russell role, and is the one who ends up marrying Buck Winston rather than the countess, played here straight by Agnes Moorehead. Ann Miller as chorus girl Miriam Aarons has no musical number whatsoever, ending her MGM contract on a sour note, yet at least gets a great catfight with Gray. By this time, the MGM musical was a "hit" ("High Society") or "miss" (this), resulting to remaking their old masterpieces either for the big screen or T.V. ("The Thin Man"), and with many of their contract players on their way out the door (this was long after Louis B. Mayer had left, although he was attempting a take-over around the time this came out), and it is sad to realize that their golden era wasn't quite over but yet never the same as it had been under the old master. A few more musicals and some biblical epics and film versions of Broadway plays would keep MGM a major player, but with T.V. keeping viewers away, it was obvious that they would never recapture the former glory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>not only doesn't this version come close, but it just is not a good film. Poor casting, poor use of the cast they did choose. Beginning with June Allyson, who is so badly miscast that nothing else matters. She is way too old for the role, and if not, she looks it, which is almost worse. She looks about 50. The hairstyle could not be less flattering if that were the point. And making this into a musical is just comical and not in a good way.Some of the sets and costumes are worth seeing. But oh, the 50's were hard on women, as far as hair and make-up went. Very difficult for beauty to shine through. Even Joan Collins looks older than she was at the time, due to the styling. Maybe I am old-fashioned, but the longer, soft hairstyles of the 30's and early 40's were so much prettier and sexier. In the 50's, they all looked so priggish and stiff, but I guess that represents the entire decade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stick to the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really pleased to finally locate this film as I'd never heard of it until seeing a segment in 'That's Entertainment Part 3' years ago. It's a big of an oddity- it almost seems as though it's the last chance for some big name women to strut their stuff on the big screen before retiring. The storyline vaguely follows the original play but the biggest error is the inclusion of male characters. The charm and cleverness of the original is the fact that men are discussed but never seen. The musical numbers are generally pretty dire so keep the forward button close to hand if you can't handle them- the banana number from the musical within the plot line is a huge cringe-fest. Great costumes by Helen Rose make it at least visually interesting (although I'm not sure where she was going with Dolores Gray's bust-line in one of the dresses- a bit of an east/west angle which looks frightening!!) Joan Collins is fun in the Crystal Allen role but a few wasted opportunities with some of the others. Why have Anne Miller in a movie and not have her dance? Anne Sheridan always lovely and Agnes Moorehead suits the role of the Countess. It's not a BAD film but it's such a strange affair. Stick to the original though I must say it is bearable compared to the 2008 version which almost had me reaching for a paper bag for both nausea and hyperventilation in it's awfulness. I'm glad to say I've seen it and maybe it will start me off on a hobby of collecting the lesser known 'treasures' of the musical genre. You WON'T leave the film singing the tunes from this film as they are generally forgettable but as a curiosity factor, I give it a 6.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been maligned for years, mainly for including men and music in this remake of the classic 1939 version. It's true that the men don't add much to this take on the story. The musical numbers range from OK (Now, Baby Now) to just plain awful. (Dick Shawn and Jim Backus in the title number and that wretched banana number.) The cast is pretty good. Joan Collins (in her first bitchy role) is practicing for her role as Alexis on "Dynasty". Charlotte Greenwood (in her last role) manages to be even more butch than Marjorie Main was in the original. Agnes Moorehead (who I love) is totally miscast as the countess, but Sandy Descher is far more likable as "Debbie" than Virgina Weidler was as "Little Mary". Dolores Gray nails it as Sylvia Fowler. The 1950s decor is appropriately garish (dig those crazy purple bass fiddles!) and the print shown on VUDU is a clean, widescreen treat. This may not be quite up to the original, but on it's own terms this is a by and large entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One day this story will make a great musical. But this isn't it. In fact, it's hardly a real musical at all. Which is strange, considering its female cast seem to be chosen according to their singing talents - and then don't use them! When Ann Miller appears on the train, surely that ought to have been the cue for a witty quintet along the lines of 'He got it coming'. But no. Nothing. When Charlotte Greenwood meets them at the hotel, that ought to have been the cue for a witty greeting song that commented on the set-up. But no. Nothing. Apart from June Allyson, all the songs (which are just 'background' stuff, not character-driven) are sung, ironically, by the MEN. And surely there were better composers around in the Fifties. Unfortunately, Jerome Kern had died a few years before. His music would have been the ideal choice with the witty words of Dorothy Fields. Even if it had produced no hits (like Centennial Summer) it might at least have been interesting. Wasn't Frank Loesser available? Even the choreography is limp. Couldn't they have got Jack Cole to at least enliven that interminable 'Bananas' number? As I said, this story has the makings of a great musical, but this is a sadly missed opportunity. Having said all that, it's still an enjoyable film. Worth watching if only to be reminded of the days when women wore FROCKS. Ah, the Fifties. Take me back to 58!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty much worthless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This glossy musical remake of THE WOMEN, the famous movie which featured a women-only cast, is nothing short of a complete disaster. This film is pretty much toothless and almost completely miscast. June Allyson? Yikes. She looks like a drip throughout the film. Hair, posture, etc, as appealing as a bowl of oatmeal. Granted, Norma Shearer wasn't the scorching beauty in THE WOMEN but she looked, eh, healthy. June looks a bit sick here. In the original, Sylvia was played by Rosalind Russell who almost stole every scene she was in. In this remake, Dolores Gray is Sylvia and looks like an embalmed drag queen-looking mummy. The only good bit of casting was having Joan Collins in the role made famous by Joan Crawford. Whenever Collins is not in the film, the film flat-lines, literally. She's the only spark in this wet firecracker, as clichd as it is for her to play the conniving man-hungry uber bitch. Remarkably, having men in the film almost added nothing except for handsome Jeff Richards who doesn't have much to do but look good. Leslie Nielsen is wasted and not very convincing. June Allyson and Nielsen as a married couple? Bleech. Some scenes are lifted directly from THE WOMEN, like the bathtub scene. Some things that sorta worked back in the 1930s simply do not work in 1956. The entire Reno bit is truly tired and should have been re-written for the 1950s.Oddly enough, this is a musical remake, probably just to accommodate June, and the musical scenes are mostly horrendous. The bit with Dick Shawn is painful to watch. The whole "Now, Baby, Now" with June singing with a bunch of gyrating male dancers is inexplicable. It's so odd it becomes brilliant if viewed as a total curio. You really wonder what they were thinking.Watching the film, with the characters trying to be classy and the rich types, moving within the tacky studio sets, the overdone gowns and all that stuff and I sorta realized how Hollywood had a truly warped Waspy vision of the world. The end result makes Hollywood look like a playground for philandering film producers who wanted to be surrounded by what they thought were the beautiful people but in reality it was more on the corny &amp; garishly gay side. Dreadful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice to hear Joan Collins say "Crystal"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this Technicolor remake of "The Women," Joan Collins plays the Joan Crawford part, and when she's asked her name, she says, "Crystal." Fans of Dynasty will go, "Ah," as she used to say "Krystle" all the time on "Dynasty." So this film serves as a foreshadowing. And that's about it. While it's very pretty to look at with some wonderful fashions, nothing can really beat the black and white version of the Clare Booth Luce play, "The Women." MGM has lined up a wonderful ensemble cast but then disappoints by not giving them anything to do. June Allyson is the star, and I found her quite delightful. Her musical numbers were enjoyable. Ann Miller was in the film, as were Delores Gray and Charlotte Greenwood (in her last film), and they had no musical numbers. However, Delores Gray with her haughty beauty and sophistication did an excellent job in the Rosalind Russell role and had a showier part than the other women. Ann Sheridan, whose voice I initially recognized but couldn't place, was also in the film. Joan Blondell, 50 years old at the time of the filming, was curious casting as a constantly pregnant woman. Agnes Moorhead was the Countess. In fact, it looked like MGM was just finishing up a lot of contracts. Wonderful actresses, all, just underused and/or misused."The Opposite Sex," unlike "The Women" had men in the cast, who added nothing. Handsome Jeff Richards as Buck had the beginning of a decent career before dropping off the radar some years later; he had the best male role. That's not saying much.If you don't know this is a remake of "The Women," and if you don't recognize some of these actresses, you will find this an enjoyable film. For those who know its roots and can't forget them, you'll watch most of the film with a grimace on your face.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What were they thinking? Here we have a witless musical version of THE WOMEN without a single decent tune. A cast of fairly competent actors without a shred of polish in the finished product. A remake of Claire Booth Luce's "The Woman" with the vacuous men now on display too--but what dull men. And the heroine is JUNE ALLYSON doing her dullest Goody-Two- Shoes routine in the Norma Shearer role of the victimized wife.I can't offer any praise on any aspect of this dreadful remake. No one deserves credit for all the changes made in the story in order to accommodate a few musical numbers that have no sparkle at all.JEFF RICHARDS as "Buck" has a handsome face and acts acceptably but his role is ludicrous when he has to sing and strum a guitar like a lovestruck cowboy. LESLIE NIELSEN is likewise at sea in the role of Allyson's husband. The only performer who seems to know that she's in a remake of "The Women" is DOLORES GRAY who does a nice bitchy turn as Sylvia Fowler. JOAN COLLINS is less than impressive as Crystal (the Joan Crawford shop-girl role). ANN SHERIDAN is totally wasted.None of it really jells. The songs are best forgotten and the acting is as limp and uninspired as the script. None of the bite of the original is present. Sorry, but this deserves every bit of obscurity it has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have seen "The Women" and recognize its merits, but am not a camp follower. It seems to me that if the story is as interesting as this one, it has room for other interpretations. The lead wife is a good woman married to a really good guy. A little before the 10 year anniversary mark, the marriage undergoes a challenge from an outside predator, directed at the husband. Unfortunately, our good little woman, through bad advice and some hurt pride, passively allows him to slide away from her. The general premise is that he will miss her and come back. But, it develops into a hostile takeover. Now, she gets to live with the results of all this conventional wisdom. Through process and circumstance, she eventually comes awake, gets fired up and finally gets in the ring.The general wrench of the story is watching a perfectly intelligent man so easily played upon by such a shallow subject. This is especially tough here, seeing it fleshed out with an actual man. Since his wife has run off on a little getaway on the strength of some of that poor advice and the pride, the field is left wide open. But, it works its way to a happy ending that allows you to unwind. And, it is written so as to give you some thrills along the way as comeuppance comes to call on the conniving antagonists. I say, it is written that way. Unfortunately here, the story relief doesn't take care of the angst created by listening to almost two hours of lame and ineffective exchanges.June Allison is a quiz now for her starring place in this. She's really gone out of style, but was very popular during this period. She billed above Barbara Stanwyck in Executive Suite (movie of its year or close), right under William Holden. She captured a lot of hearts and had a huge following, with women naming their children after her and hers. Whether you like her or not, she was box office at the time and this part was right on for her style. However, she's definitely included in the present day disappointment with this movie. Regardless of performance, even the most die hard June fans would have to admit that this was a particularly bad hair movie. :-) "The Women" enthusiasts turn out to be vindicated for their ardor and dire predictions toward any attempt at remake. But, really, it's not that it's a failed remake; it's that it's a failed movie. The various factors have been detailed here by others. At least they changed the title.</fullReview>

June Allyson, a big MGM musical singing/dancing star sings a few incidental numbers but when they come to the big dreamy ballad of the film, her voice is dubbed. The only song worth listening to is a re-make of an earlier movie version of a June Allyson song titled "Young Man with a Horn". Also, why did the studio think that casting a good comedy actor like Dick Shawn as a singer in a show was a good idea? As for Joan Blondell, she might as well not have even been in the picture for all the screen time she had. What a waste of talented people!</fullReview>

The story follows the divorce/remarriage formula that was worn so well in the late 30s and 40s, with wife divorcing husband (never vice versa) only to remarry him, so that divorce isn't condoned.1) This version is barely a musical, with a handful of numbers presented as realistic performances. In other words, June Allyson plays a singer and her husband Leslie Nielsen is a Broadway producer, and we see samples of their work, but these forgettable numbers have nothing to do with the plot. The characters don't burst into spontaneous song and dance in the middle of dialogue. It's still set in a version of our "real world," not the world of musicals--more's the pity.2) The '39 version had the gimmick or stunt of having zero male characters on screen. This remake doesn't do that, and therefore is more ordinary.3) Attitude changes: If I recall the first version correctly, the marriage breaks up over false rumors of the husband's infidelity. In this remake, the rumors aren't false. Nielsen defends himself by saying "She meant nothing to me." That's one modern concession, and the other is that Nielsen goes thru with marriage to the other woman. Therefore, in order for the first marriage to be restored, the 2nd marriage must break irrevocably. And the heroine's fellow divorcees in Reno are depicted in the first film in existential misery, smiling through their tears, their raucous attitude covering sadness. In the remake, the serial divorcees are rewarded with seemingly happy lives and new boyfriends. So divorce does solve a few problems.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Allyson vs Collins going Jungle Red...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Music and men appear in THE OPPOSITE SEX, the 1956 remake of the 1939 classic THE WOMEN. Based on the play by Clair Booth Luce, this remake stars June Allyson as a retired nightclub entertainer who loses her husband (Leslie Nielsen) to a maneater named Crystal Allen (a young Joan Collins) and how after a year, she decided to fight to get her husband back. Though fairly dated, this musical remake holds up pretty well and talented gals like Ann Miller, Dolores Grey, Charlotte Greenwood, and AGnes Moorhead are all given moments to shine, but there's one thing about this movie that I will never forget: June Allyson performs two musical numbers in the film, one is a big production number called "Yeah, Baby Yeah". The second is a weepy love ballad she sings at a party in her home. But when she opens her mouth to sing this ballad, Doris Day's voice comes out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like the movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I like this film. I have seen the original (The Women) and this remake and love them both. They both examine the same premise, but I like the inclusion of the male characters in this film. I must say that I prefer Crawford's Crystal to Collins', and I absolutely adored Agnes Moorehead's Countess to Mary Boland's. However, Rosalind Russell, of Mame fame, was fabulous as the original (1939) Sylvia Fowler! Both movies are phenomenal in the own right.I was afraid that the lack of male characters to which were often referred, would limit the movie. However, The Women, literally held their own. I almost didn't miss the guys!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who owed June Allyson a favor??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie's got Ann Miller, Charlotte Greenwood and Joan Blondell, and we get not a single tap, contortionist leg-kick, or warble out of any of 'em. We do, however, get two(2) song'n'dance numbers and one vocal solo by... June Allyson. June Allyson??? I'm sorry, she's probably a very nice person, and a fine actress given the appropriate role, but in this movie she's completely out of place. One can only wonder.. what's the story behind this? I mean, one doesn't put Ann Miller in a movie and give June Allyson the dancing parts without a good reason, does one?Aside from the above, it's a visually gorgeous piece of brainless chick-flick fluff. Worth watching (with the gals only) to hiss at Joan Collins, ooh and ahh and snicker at the costumes, and wonder if people ever actually lived like this.And put to rest forever the question: Was Leslie Nielsen BORN with white hair?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hel-lo!!!!!!! It's a remake of The Women in color and with men and songs!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's such a classic 50's post code movie, it's almost unfair to compare it to the much sharper and groundbreaking (not a man in it!) original film, The Women. The color and costumes are pretty mesmerizing, the cream-puff attitudes and full on sexless musical numbers are not. The number that contains the name of the film might as well have been performed by a castrato. I must admit I found myself amused by the whole optimistic 50's world I was born into and never saw. But it must be viewed as a completely separate entity from The Women. Oddly, The Opposite Sex's characters ape the original ones, so it's hard to get in to them as themselves, they often seem like pastel toned versions of their former starker black and white selves.Even though the 40's film had a hokey ending, and an upbeat tone, it was much edgier, and packs quite a wallop even today. The women band together and fight for each other, and the invisible world of men seems isolated and clueless, worker bees delivering money honey to their Queens.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of 1939's "The Women" Shines" ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>June Allyson tackles the Norma Shearer role of "The Women" in the 1956 remake of "The Opposite Sex." The former film did not show any men, but the latter sure did.Allyson, a retired singer, is happily married to Leslie Nielsen. Vicious gossips led by Colleen Gray soon end that. A quickie divorce in Nevada throws Nielsen into the arms of vicious show-girl Joan Collins. Her room-mate was played by the late Carolyn Jones. Jones is wasted in her part. She could be vicious in films, but we don't see this here.Waiting for a divorce in Nevada for 6 weeks brings Allyson with a whole group of women. She is soon joined by Gray whose husband, the late Bill Goodwin, has been unfaithful.On the home front we have Joan Blondell, married and forever pregnant and Anne Sheridan in the pivotal role of Allyson's dear friend and writer. Sheridan tries to get Allyson to revoke the divorce. Before this can be done, Nielsen calls to say that he has wed Collins.Despondent, after a year, Allyson learns that Nielsen is unhappy. Outrageously, Collins in carrying on with Buck, a cowboy singer, who was discovered by Gray out in Nevada and brought back to N.Y.You have to see this one to see how Allyson gets Nielsen back. The women are clever and cunning in this one. Great fun, and it's set with a musical too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>June Allyson is not naughty enough for her husband, so he goes for Joan Collins, who has a roving eye of her own. They have to decide, in the end, which twosome is preferable. What seems like a million other characters move in and out of the story, all focused around Ms. Allyson. Some of the characters are interesting and recognizable, some are not? all become tiresome, eventually. It does sound, like others have commented, that Doris Day sings one of Allyson's songs (early-ish in the movie). I've been watching TCM's tribute to Allyson, and some of these films are strange indeed! It's nice of TCM to show them, though.Allyson often wears something to match her lipstick. Ms. Collins likes to smoke in her bathtubs. *** The Opposite Sex (10/26/56) David Miller ~ June Allyson, Joan Collins, Dolores Gray, Ann Sheridan</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic 50's movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the classic story of woman got man, woman loses man, and how her and her friends conspire to win him back. The fabulous gowns, terrific dialogue, and wonderful over the top acting is what draws the viewer to this movie. It is not a musical, yet the story takes place around several musical productions. Many of the stars are indeed musical performers but in this story it is their acting that is showcased. The production is a remake of the classic "The Women" but in no way stands in comparison to the acting of Joan Crawford or Betty Davis. It is not supposed to. Instead it is a contemporary story about the rarified lives of wealthy New York women of the 1950's. It is a wonderful movie which I have enjoyed for years and know you will, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this is a 1956 film I am commenting on.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a snazzy dazzling femme fashion fest, you cannot go past this cinema scope MGM fed musical comedy remake of THE WOMEN. Sadly so many media reviews always say "Oh it is nowhere near as good as it's original version: THE WOMEN from 1939" thus off putting so many viewers from bothering to watch. If they do, and I certainly encourage you to see the whole film in a cinemascope or widescreen TV presentation, you will be treated to a visual feast coupled with production values to leave you gasping. A full roster of MGM female stars with stylish gowns and sumptuous settings, this 1956 version speaks better to younger audiences today than the 1939 one. Why? Well the older one is soooo long and it is a real (and terrific) Broadway adaptation...which is great for middle aged viewers. Teens and 20 somethings today will lap up this '56 version and rave about it to their friends. It is spectacular, funny and awash with camp style and frocks. Also....if you know your musicals, just for fun, look at the scene in this film where June Allyson performs the bare stage number with the big blue bass player band NOW BABY NOW ..........and then look at the finale of the Julie Andrews musical STAR! where Julie performs the JENNY number in Lady In the dark. Look familiar? Am I the only person who thinks he is seeing the same set design and choreography? These two dance numbers did to me and I wonder if you agree. Robert Sydney is credited with NOW BABY NOW and Michael Kidd is credited for JENNY but the similarity is very much there. Both numbers are performed on a bare stage with a group of acrobatic dancers who juggle her about and climb scaffold/ladders etc...right to the 'flop on the floor' finale. Interestingly STAR! covers the period of the original of this film: THE WOMEN (1939) and has a dynamic set period piece from 1941: Lady In The Dark. STAR! also homages or copies the Shanghai Lil Chinatown piece from Footlight Parade of 1933 in Limehouse Blues. What was Michael Kidd doing in 1967? maybe he saw all these films too. Have a look at STAR! because it is a sensational film anyway, and compare the NOW BABY NOW number from this film immediately after. Bingo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Opposite Sex" is a wonderful movie surrounding Kay Hilliard (June Allyson). Her husband (Leslie Nielson) has an affair with one the showgirls in is own show, Crystal Allen (Joan Collins). When Kay finds out she is desperately confused because she doesn't want ten years of marriage to go down the drain, but her cattish friends convince her to file for divorce. This is a glam movie which tells the story of may women all over the world, not just in the 1950's but in the 21st century too. Set in New York in the 1950's "The Opposite Sex" is a must-see for all those classic movie lovers.</fullReview>
