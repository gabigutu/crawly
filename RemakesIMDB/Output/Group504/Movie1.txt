		<shortDescription>Badly Lit Women And Other Problems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Insane really. Even if you haven't seen the original George Cukor movie with Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Rosalind Russell, Paulette Goddard, Joan Fontaine and a cast of a thousand other stars you may dismiss this forced, politically correct, depressing comedy. Depressing for many different reasons. Meg Ryan for one. What has she done to herself? Her face can hardly move. That alone puts her miles away from Norma Shearer. Annette Bening should be suing the DP and Debra Messing, what the hell was she doing here? Actresses with no connection in the public's subconscious trying to pass for friends, totally unconvincingly. Eva Mendes in the Joan Crawford part is an outrageous piece of miscasting. What a terrible idea! Her character is like a trans-gender performer without any taste or subtlety. Bizarre to think that a woman adapted and directed this women.The only positive things I can mention are a short but very funny appearance by Bette Midler and Cloris Leachman as the housekeeper.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Women 08 It's Not A 30's Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an impossible task to update a classic that was embedded in its time and as such could travel the waves of time intact because we could adapt to its historical context. Now this 2008 version seems the one that's dated. I used to love Meg Ryan, reminded me of Carol Lombard now she's more like Joan Rivers, in appearance if not in spirit. There is nothing funny about her. Strangely enough she looks better in the second part of the film. In any case, the modernity of Norma Shearer's performance is unbeatable. Annette Bening is better but couldn't cancel the memory of Rosalind Russell, who could? If one can divorce oneself from the George Cukor original, and one must to be able to sit through it, there are a few pleasures to be had, mostly thanks to Cloris Leachman, Candice Bergen (playing Meg Ryan's mom for the second time, remember "Rich and Famous"?) and Bette Midler in a much to brief stint playing the part once played by Mary Boland. The most unforgivable blunder is Eva Mendes's Crystal. She couldn't fill Joan Crawford's shoes not even by mistake. Her performance is vulgar, jarring and ugly. How strange that someone as smart as Diane English could give us such a confusing picture of women. Oh well, I had to see it, I saw it and I'm very disappointed but hardly surprised.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a Spanish tourist in Los Angeles and a fanatic movie lover I committed a terrible mistake. I went to see "The Women" The remake of one of my all time favorites. I've seen the original many many times, in fact I own it. My rushing to see the remake was based on Diane English, the woman responsible for "Murphy Brown" My though was: how bad can it be? She must know what she's doing. Well, I don't know what to say. I don't understand what happened. The Botoxed women is a rather depressing affair. Meg Ryan or whoever played Mary - she looked a bit like a grotesque version of Meg Ryan...another actress perhaps wearing a Meg Ryan mask - she doesn't bring to the character nothing of what Norma Shearer did in 1939. The new one is a tired, unconvincing prototype of what has become a farce within a farce. The "friends" Annette Bening, Debra Messing, Jada Pinket Smith are as disconnected as anything I've ever seen and if this wasn't enough: Eva Mendes as Crystal, the character created by Joan Crawford in one of her best and funniest performances. Eva Mendes's casting is really the poster sign for how wrong, how ill conceived this commercial attempt turned up. I didn't give it a 1 out respect for Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This misfires by a mile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I believe an entire book can be written about the odyssey to remake the classic film on which this film is loosely based. When Hollywood first started talking about such enterprise, the reaction was always negative because there were just too many aspects that could have gone wrong, starting with the solid ensemble that made the original unforgettable, and that's exactly where things begin souring here, with the selection of actresses that otherwise can do remarkable work, but that are not suited to the parts, and sadly enough, have been directed with the heavy hand of a director that doesn't understand or appreciate the source material.It seems as if there is no focus or direction, or as if the direction that has been taken is to obliterate anything that was good about the original film. This is called an updating, as in let's drain the story out of humor, snappy dialogue, and any interesting premise. Most of all, let's prove that women have come a long way, except that the problem is that we don't really get (at least by watching this film) where the women are truly going.For starters, casting Meg Ryan in the central role proves almost fatal to the movie because somehow she seems to have locked herself into some sort of limbo where women don't really change appearances, even after 20 years of working in the movies. Her Mary which proved to be a difficult role in the 30's, somehow grew from her interaction with the other stereotypes, like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" by learning, observing, and realizing that she had a choice in the matter. It might not have been a choice that women would celebrate nowadays, but it was fun ride, and part of the fun, was the catty, silly, sometimes slapstick routines that elevated that movie into the realm of the sublime. In here, we are down to earth with a thud. By changing the nature of Sylvia, the film has lost a lot of its spark, and it isn't in anyway Annette Bening's fault. I couldn't help but admiring how she tried to save this sinking ship and got a sinking feeling as she struggled with the horrible lines she was handled. Thankfully I entertained myself by looking at some of her terrific outfits and kept reminding myself how talented this lady really was. Her Sylvia is wise but flawed, and she could have been a great creation. Unfortunately Ms. English wasn't paying attention to her own work and loses control of the one character that could have turned the film into a fresh direction.Yet that wasn't the biggest blasphemy of them all. In the original, we have Joan Crawford doing probably one of the best performances by a woman. Her Crystal is legendary, with conniving lines, incendiary moves, duplicitous maneuvers, and some very sexy poses. She was the link between the male and the female, and through her we knew what the whole catastrophe was about. She provided the tension between men and women. She was dangerous, sexy, the ultimate femme fatale. A woman of intelligence that we feared and admired, and most importantly, we wanted to destroy to save our heroine. Eva Mendes, as gorgeous as she is, is two dimensional in this outing because of weak writing, and once again, some bad casting.There are more atrocities in the film, such as the addition of a terrible role for Mensing as the dedicated mother who lives for having babies, and the rather annoying lesbian turn by Pinkett. Then comes the biggest waste of talent in the movie, as Bette Middler, who is a little unrecognizable in her make up, shows the spark of what could have been. Her acidic delivery reminds us of the contemporary angle the film could have taken. Her words revive and put a big of much needed naughtiness in the film, and it is exciting to see that it could really fly, then she is gone. She is in the film all of six minutes, and she fades away in the middle of the muddle.Here is a movie that raised our anticipation level and truly disappointed us, a film that could have joined the successful "Sex in the City" who made an amazing transition to the big screen because it respected its source material and didn't compromise. It gave us more, bigger and better adaptation. It truly updated what had made it successful before. "The Women" in its present reincarnation needs to go back and rework itself, much like "The Hulk" did it this year, find more suitable performers, a really good writer, and most of all, someone who truly treasures what good movies are about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paging Rosalind Russell...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I should say that I've seen the '39 version at least 100 times; know all the dialog, and have read the '36 play, which is different from the '39 and contains nuggets of gold of its own. This version is as flat as a Lifetime movie on adultery. There's a reason you haven't seen an expensive campaign of TV ads for it. According to Entertainment Weekly, Bening hated the catty tone of the original and how the women spent the whole time going to war on each other. GUESS WHAT??! That was Booth's intent. It was a slick, theatrical take on gossip, adultery, and back-biting among a set of well-heeled Manhattan socialites. The crowd that made this new version had no intention of honoring the original source material. They pick at it weirdly, putting in half a scene here and half a scene there that come from the first version. Bette Midler (who is in just a few scenes and acts the old Countess part in a broad, grinning style) doesn't have any context in this version. She mentions going after "Buck," which is a key element in the original -- then he's never mentioned again. This movie is so dull that I'm not going to over-analyze it, but here are a few things that I found unbelievable: &gt; Mary Haines bragging to her domestic staff: "I can suck the nails out of a board!" Right. Great writing. Norma Shearer could've done a line reading on that &amp; gotten an Oscar nom, right? &gt; A COMPASSIONATE Sylvia Fowler!!!??? Annette Bening got what she wanted, and the movie just sort of withers away. Claire Booth used Sylvia as the comic engine that swept through the play. As portrayed immortally by Rosalind Russell, she was an ignorant, spiteful woman who rattled off reams of petty, ridiculous, irresistible dialog that is still classic and quotable. She wasn't above biting Paulette Godard's ankle. The 2008 filmmakers decided that this character had to die. In killing her off, they killed the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Women?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say I was disappointed is an understatement. An amateur film made by professionals. I was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions (something I've never done)I was stopped by Cloris Leachman really. She rings true, the only one I should say. This new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 30's. This ones are "acting" for us trying to be with it but their "conflict" is exactly the same as it has always been, in movies anyway. The fun of the original was based on a crisp, vitriolic and very funny script. A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast. All the elements that are missing here. TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nominees/winners. There wasn't anything organic about it. The whole thing felt like a put on, improvised in the moment without a clear objective. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really wish I had read everyone's review before going to see the movie... it was one of the most excruciating films that I've ever seen. I was ready to leave the theater 5 minutes into the movie; I should have followed my instinct. The movie offered nothing new or clever, it was boring and very cliché. I was surprised to find that it was directed by a woman! The characters did not represent any women that I know, they were boring, bitter and melodramatic. The movie was unrealistic and depressing and a waste of time and money. And the actors looked tired, poor make-up and hair styling. It was recently compared to the Sex and in the City movie; it was not even half as good. My suggestion, do not see this movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preachy Out-dated Propaganda</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was very disappointed by this movie. Ms English who says that she is a fan of the original movie seemed to have taken a great piece of artistic work, and transformed it into a flat-lined "ho-hum" you've come a long way baby production. I tried to like Meg Ryan's Mary Haines, but she was just boring. She didn't seem to feel anything about her husband's affair. There was no emotional struggle, no deep hurt. In the original 1939 movie Norma Shearer's Mary Haines felt betrayed, shocked, vulnerable, confused and angry. The 2008 production was more about some fake sisterhood theme, (Actually my wife's words)and didn't make you shed a tear or even chuckle. The only performances that were note worthy we're of Debra Messing, and Bette Midler. (I wanted more of Bette.) There was really no protagonist in this movie. The Sylvia Fowler character had too many sub themes to it. And Crystal Allen had no fire. The remake of the department store encounter with Annette Benning, and Miss Mendez was Luke warm. Also the pacing was slow as well. Obviously the 1939 version needed to be updated, but this one wasn't it. The reason that the original version worked so well was that the characters were dealing with "man" problems. A subject by the way which isn't out-dated. The magic of the original movie was that the movie was about both sexes, while you never saw the men.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How The Mighty Have Fallen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original 1930s version of the film, but this remake is one of the worst I have seen from a major production studio in years. Seeing actors such as Meg Ryan and Annette Bening, once near A level talents, sleepwalk their way through poorly scripted roles is painful. There appeared to be no desire to be in front of the camera for anyone in this film.Jada Pinkett Smith and Debra Messing play worthless roles that have no bearing on the plot and add no entertainment value. Jada Pinkett Smith's character is used as nothing more than a ploy to appear modern, having an African American lesbian character, but in actuality she is there to just look cool. There is no actual reason why Messing in this film other than to fill out the amount of women in the original I take.The side characters played by Eva Mendes and Debi Mazar are stereotypical female characters, with Mendes portraying the vixen looking to steal the wealthy but bored and mildly neglected husband and Mazar covering the gossip roles.The movie is boring, lacking charm, humor, or sympathy for any characters. It almost felt like the movie was a punishment for everyone involved, whether in front of or behind the camera.There is one glimmering hope in the film, however little it is allowed to shine surrounded by the dim and dying stars around it is Cloris Leachman. Leachman is still an amazing talent that brings her remarkable charm and humor to the film, in the small role that she has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a foul message to send to young women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen the original movie others have commented on, so my perspective is just about this movie without comparison.I found the message of the movie to be,: if you only worry about yourself, all will be right with the world, everything will fall into place, your lovers will love you more, your friends will respect and like you more, your employers will want you more, pay you more and even your own children and parents will love you more.I find this message to be reprehensible and totally false.Kudos for the very funny birthing scene at the end; there isn't a mother out there who won't laugh during that scene.Overall a very disappointing movie plot. I didn't find myself rooting for anyone in this movie. I thought they were all pathetic self absorbed individuals that I just didn't care what happened to them and that's not a movie people want to see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not a comedy. It is not even funny in the "this movie is so bad it's funny" department. Rather, it is just plain bad. Other reviewers mention the bad lighting, but beyond that is the abundance of bad plastic surgery.Meanwhile, a lot of great acting talent was wasted on a poor screenplay and uninspired direction. The main characters are one-dimensional and boring. (It is hard to feel sympathy for any of them). It is also hard to see the four characters as close friends. It seems like just a bunch of women thrown together, pretending to be close.I won't list all of the problems with this movie, as it doesn't merit that much of anyone's attention.

		<shortDescription>"The Women" review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine a film the complete opposite of Lawrence of Arabia, instead of having an all male cast, it has an all female cast. Instead of being set in the barren deserts of Arabia, it is set in the bulging metropolis of New York City. And instead of it being one of the greatest films ever made, it is one of the most pointless, boring and forgettable.The film concerns Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a perfect wife and mother, the envy of all others in her high society Manhatten social circle. She is painted as a women bearing the weight of the world on her shoulders, despite the fact she needs a live in nanny and housekeeper to cope with her one child. But I don't want to be too hard on her, Mary does all this whilst taking a liassez-faire attitude towards the fashion designing job her father has given her. This idyllic lifestyle cannot last forever though and things start to crash in a very real way.Mary's husband is cheating on her and her father fires her for not working hard enough. She is quite naturally upset and breaks down a little.Mary needs to bounce back though, for the sake of her impressionable young daughter and for herself. She does this through rehab, hair straightening and designing her own line of clothes; though amazingly for this kind of film, not a montage. Mary succeeds; her daughter loves her, her mother loves her, her friends love her and her husband decides he loves her now. She decides to take her cheating husband back after realising it was her fault he cheated, as she didn't dote on him enough.The films one saving grace is that it doesn't go down the "all men are evil" route.</fullReview>

Meg Ryan playing Meg Ryan - how tiresome is that?! And it got worse ... so much worse. The horribly cliché lines, the stock characters, the increasing sense I was watching a spin-off of "The First Wives Club" and the ultimate hackneyed schtick in the delivery room.

		<fullReview>I am a big fan of the original not because I believe that the antiquated story line makes sense for anyone much less women in modern society, I am a fan because of that great scene with Joan Crawford in the bathtub. I love that bathroom. I was dragged to this remake by a friend knowing that it would be disappointing. Horrid, is more like it! First of all, it looks like they lit the whole film with florescent lighting and those shots of Annette Bennings hands, she should sue! I think this was really a remake of the Valley of the Dolls and they just mislabeled the prints. Meg Ryan has lost her spunk and is completely flat on screen, Debra Messing's character is dressed like a bag lady, Eva Mendez compared to Joan Crawford (need I say more), just terrible. Terrible performances, it felt at times that the cast was trying to remember their lines. The dialogue was trite and boring. And to top it all off, instead of making some adjustments to the story to make it work for the modern woman, they left it with Meg Ryan blaming herself for her husbands infidelity and falling wonderfully in love with the cheating schmuck because after all it is not enough to have an extremely successful clothing line, a wonderful daughter and tons of money, you have to have a man! Nightmare! Rent Sex and the City instead which makes you want to jump on a plane and spend the weekend in Manhatten with the girls.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply a bad movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented this because I know the 1939 movie well and wanted to see how it was updated. I sat through the whole thing, but it's really a bad movie.Let me start by staying that I don't think the 1939 movie is a masterpiece. It has some wonderful scenes, brilliantly directed by George Cukor and brilliantly brought off by a remarkable cast who knew how to deliver bitingly clever dialogue. But there are also maudlin scenes that kill the pacing. An uneven work.The remake isn't uneven, I'll grant it that. It's uniformly awful all the way through.To begin with, the characters have no internal coherence, which they most certainly do in the 1939 version. In the remake, it seems that the director did a survey of what would appeal to modern women and then randomly distributed those qualities to the various women in the movie. The modern Chrystal Allen isn't really nasty; unlike in the original, she never betrays Steven Haines. Sylvia Fowler starts off being repulsively self-centered, but then varies back and forth between caring and superficial without ever really being nasty. In fact, NO ONE is really nasty, and that deprives the remake of a lot of the bite of the original.The modern script is also sadly lacking in humor, unlike the 1939 version. It just isn't that funny. And when it does repeat lines from the original, it is painful to hear how poorly they are delivered.In short, this movie has nothing to recommend itself. It plays like a mediocre TV show - it was directed by a TV director, so I guess that shouldn't come as a surprise. The 1939 version, though not a masterpiece, remains miles ahead of this sad excuse for a feature film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sit-Com Factor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film could have been a decent re-make, and gosh knows it tried (or Ms. English tried). Assembling talented actors together with a successful &amp; experienced writer/director should be a formula for a decent film. But Ms. English's experience - according to her IMDb bio - is exclusively limited to television work, and it is glaringly obvious throughout this film.I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film, and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential: it looked and felt like it was made for television. To give some credit to Ms. English, many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV (and maybe a laugh track would have helped). So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen. If the whole film had been chopped up into a mini-series or a sit-com, I think it could have worked. But this is cinema and sadly Ms. English's talents didn't translate. I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors &amp; the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled! Meg Ryan is her usual perky, cute self (except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face), but where did she have a chance to use her talent?! She has made films where she doesn't recreate her stereo-typed role and done them well... but not here. Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions - such a great talent and yet such a poor performance! I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance, and it was sad to see. What worked in this film in the 1930s doesn't translate to the 2000s, and no one helped Ms. English get the changes &amp; updates or subtleties right. If only she (as writer, director AND producer) had reached out for some assistance, I think it could have been good. But it was not.It's so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyone's time &amp; money! This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate: A few movie execs are having a meeting &amp; the caption reads: "Let's remake a classic with worse everything!"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The City of Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Women (2008) by Diane English is sadly such a waste of talent. With Annette Benning, Candice Bergen, Bette Midler, Cloris Leachman whom I like and enjoy in everything I've seen them, and Meg Ryan, Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing, and Eva Mendes who may not be my favorite actors but are nice to look at, how could the movie be boring, predictable, embarrassing, sloppy, and simply bad? It was made by Diane English who is known as the writer of the very successful TV show Murphy Brown, and it is her first movie for which she wrote a script. The movie has been a labor of love for English who had tried for many years to make it happen and I respect that. I even found the scenes with the supporting players, Bergen, Leechaman, Carry Fisher and Bette Middler in short but memorable cameos, funny, smart, and enjoyable but in general the movie is a second hand "Sex and the City" which was released few months ago. I did not find Sex and the City very good when I saw it but next to The Women, it was simply brilliant. At least, Sex and the City spared us the long and tasteless scene in the hospital's delivery room where one of the characters' was having a baby and her friends were there supporting her. Poor Debra Messing, what did she do to deserve that nightmare she was put through and we, the viewers together with her? The movies like "The Women" give the whole genre, chick flicks, a bad name. It is nothing wrong with the genre, but why is it so difficult to make a really good comedy about female friendships and hardships, about dealing with marriage, motherhood, and proving yourself professionally? These are all very compelling and important subjects any modern woman can relate to. Why making movies with the lines, dialogs, and situations so clichéd, predictable, not funny and insulting that they will be forgotten as soon as the movie is over?After I saw the new movie, I checked out from my local library the original The Women and I truly enjoyed it. The story was told much better 70 years ago, and kept my interest all the way. The old movie had a real star power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sad and shallow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another Hollywood portrayal of motherhood that is sad and shallow. In this world, Meg Ryan doesn't become much of a mother until she "finds herself" -- through what? A glamorous career of fashion design, of course! It's all about what she wants, don't you know? That's the moral to this story and the real key to happiness in The Women. When Ryan's character was "just" a mom, her preteen daughter just couldn't connect with her, poor thing. But now that she's making the New York scene as a fashion designer, it's all sweetness and light. "Mom, this is so cool!" she fawns lovingly, with new-found admiration for her mother (who basically abandoned her while she was off "finding herself.") And, of course, the cheating husband is SO attracted to her now that's she's focused on herself. Meanwhile, the only mother in the group with more than one offspring is the ridiculous Debra Messing who plays up every possible stereotype of a "breeder." Always pregnant and binge eating, and of course her children are running around wild and screaming in public places. Well, that's what you get for having more than one. Everyone knows having more than one kid is a nightmare, and so demeaning and beneath us as women. And that's just how confining and depressing motherhood is,right? Who in their right mind would want that when she could be the person she was truly meant to be (by being a fashion designer, with great hair, by the way!) It is a sad thing, and misleading, to portray motherhood this way. The truth is that women were made to have and sacrifice for their children. It is the source and meaning of true love. Motherhood is not only the most important thing a woman can ever do, it is the most beautiful and fulfilling, but only when viewed through the eyes of love and self-giving. This movie is supposed to be all about women and getting what they want. Too bad it denies the source of true beauty and happiness: self-giving,the opposite of "all about getting what you want."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We shouldn't Talk down to women" - Mission Unaccomplished</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was confusing more than anything else. I still can't figure out what the message is of this movie and more so, who the target audience is? As this is a remake (which I have not seen) maybe it's so bad because the dialogue is outdated? Or is the target audience 19-year old girls that might grab this excuse of a film at 2 for 1 Sex and the City-night?What happened to Candace Bergen? - As Meg Ryans mother she provided an intelligent balance in rhetorics and dialog but at the end of the movie she has transformed to a babbling, botoxed and victimized housewife. And the Jada Pinkett Smith character as the gay friend who in her womanizer, spread-leg, shot-drinking self is so over the top trying to portray a lesbian that it makes me think that the director never met a gay woman in her life! Why else would she portray this WONDERFUL actress as a foul mouthed macho man? I can't even comment on the Eva Mendez character. Ms Mendez is a fantastic actress who in her prior roles has done nothing but added "Girl Power" to the row of the typical Hollywood vamp. She is a sexy, beautiful, strong Latina who in this movie comes off as nothing but a victim. I think the idea was to portray her as the conniving snake who steal other womens husbands - and that's fine. But she comes off as nothing but stupid with the attention span of a tween. If this movie's target audience are adult women, it makes me nothing less than ANGRY. Did the director think that we, the women, are that uninvolved? Incredibly heavy subjects were brought up but all the director did was throw fluff at it. The subject matter of friendship betrayal for example - the entire movie could have been dedicated to it! You have 4 very different women with extreme circumstances. Each one of them could have developed a different solution or cope with the problem and actually have HELPED someone. Do NOT watch this movie. It is a complete waste of time.Please excuse any errors. English is not my first language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is offensive to women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is an absolute disgrace and so horribly reductive and misogynistic which makes it so unbelievable that it was directed by a woman and women agreed to act in it. These women couldn't be more 90s Cosmo/sex and the city stereotypes who also look like they're in the 90s, only the movie was made in 2008! If it wasn't for all the plastic surgery faces I would definitely think this was a 90s movie, I mean even the colour grade was 90s! I haven't seen the original but I'm sure even in the late 30s they would have been more progressive than this. The dialogue is painful and clichéd at best and it contains many many cringing moments. Cringing not as funny haha but cringing as in the script is absolutely offensive. Ever heard of the Bechdel test? It asks if a work of fiction features at least two women who talk to each other about something other than a man. (Wikipedia) Well this movie fails the test and it's a movie with an all female cast. This movie has successfully become my worst movie of all time followed by Adam Sandler's Click.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did they do it?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went along to this movie with some trepidation; the original is a masterpiece of both writing and acting and unfortunately my fears were realized. This is a humorless piece of work and I sat in the theater waiting for the wit and humor to begin- I'm still waiting, it seems. Updating the storyline to the present time just didn't work and the altering of characters an absolute travesty- why did they introduce Bette Midler's character when she disappeared just as quickly as she arrived; the related character in the 1939 original was an integral part of the plot. The women in the cinema laughed a few times but nothing touched me as being funny with the exception of a line from Meg Ryan talking to her mother about her situation and telling her that 'it's not like a 1930's movie'- I sorely wished I was viewing the 1930's version. It was all too touchy feely 'sisters stick together' and really needing some of the acerbic wit and clever dialog from the original play- I still watch the original movie and pick up a line that I have never caught before. There is no sense of closure to this new version, and whilst the 1939 movie is politically incorrect by todays standards, each thread was tied up and when the movie ended- it did so strongly. This remake should be labeled with a warning for any viewers- if you know the original, don't bother: I felt cheated by losing part of my life in a cinema watching this unmemorable piece of fluff. Bring on the Jungle Red!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1939 "The Women" garnered some really die hard followers. There are message boards still going on it. "I have two questions; first, what did she say about _______; and, second _________." Someone comes along a few posts later and says she can answer the first part of the question, and does, but not sure yet about the second. It's that embedded. Most of the fan-atics of the original warned against any attempt to remake something so perfect. They jumped on "The Opposite Sex," and trounced that rather thoroughly. It was a bad movie. But, their full fury is earned here. It turns out their dire prediction of failure is vindicated in both cases. At least "The Opposite Sex" changed the name before they changed it all around. Here, it's not only a change-around, but an even further deterioration in flow, timing, direction, authenticity with added errors in casting and performance. Don't directors know how to say "cut" anymore? This should be followed by a firm instruction as to what's really going on here, how the characters feel in this scene, and, let's start again from ? whatever point. They used to say at the end of filming that it's in the can, meaning the finished reel is in its metal case and ready to be distributed. Sadly, this weak effort with its canned performances was finished before production ended, and quite unready for distribution.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Diane English should be thrown of the Business!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What an absolute horror! Diane English got it all wrong. On the DVD she claims that "The Women" is all about the women. Wrong. The original film is about gossip. She takes a very timeless story and butchers it in her updates and gives it a happy ending. Seriously?!? I thought everything to do with the Norma Shearer character was obnoxious in the original, but Meg Ryan (or what used to be her face) was dreadful.Can I also put a big SHAME ON YOU out to the hair stylist, costuming, and makeup people for this film? Annette Benning is a stunning woman, the face of Paramount, yet they managed to make her look like a dowdy old hag. They made Jada Pinkett Smith unrecognizable and Debra Messing look like a troll. And, Bette Midler.. What did she have to do with anything? Her character was completely wasted and pointless. The script was mindless and everything out of these women's mouths was tired and unfunny. How many times did I have to announce, watching this DVD, "Oh that was supposed to be another funny joke". The jokes are right out of the 1980's, cliché, and so recycled that they make used unmatched, thread worn socks from the Salvation Army desirable for purchase. Diane English's women are sad people - they're all really cardboard, materialistic, shallow, and fake.Horrible, horrible, horrible train wreck. Needless to say, I hated this movie and everybody in it. What a waste of time, my intelligence, my money, and the cast.To Mick Jagger I can only say this - stick to films like ENIGMA from now on. Never attach yourself to this kind of garbage again! See the original and get that the story is about different women, all with their own insanity (including the co-dependent Mary), whom are not to be admired. Their gossip leads to nothing but trouble and it never ends.Oh, and while you're at it see the 1990's film GOSSIP because even that was pretty good and way better than this junk!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The women, not "The Women"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director/screenwriter Diane English's 2008 update of George Cukor's 1939 MGM classic comedy unfortunately shows more mothballs than its predecessor. Based on Clare Booth Luce's shrewdly observant 1936 play on the relationships that evolve among a strictly female group of pampered Manhattan socialites, the story would seem ripe for a contemporary remake. Instead, because of English's thematic overreach, the production comes across as an extended therapy session with a paucity of wit. What's more, the diverse lifestyles of women today have been reduced to sitcom-level stereotypes in this movie, and the original play's central conceit of eliminating men from the storyline seems even more contrived given the openly pansexual evolution that has occurred among men as well as women since the 1930's. To add insult to injury, the recent big screen adaptation of HBO's "Sex and the City" did this sort of sorority-style dishing much better and with far sharper fangs.The skeleton of the original play remains as the story centers on wealthy Mary Haines, who gave up her promising clothing design career to become the devoted wife of a Wall Street financial wizard. Like "Sex and the City", she is surrounded by three best friends - Sylvie Fowler, a successful, cutthroat magazine editor in the mold of Miranda Priestly in "The Devil Wears Prada" (yet another film this echoes); perennially pregnant Edie Cohen representing the stay-at-home wife; and Alex Fisher, a lesbian author who seems to represent every repressed group generally excluded from such an exclusive clique. Through a mouthy manicurist, they find out Mary's husband is having an affair with man-eater Crystal Allen, a perfume girl at Saks more than willing to break up a marriage as she struggles to become an actress. The rest of the plot doesn't matter much since it becomes a series of scenes focused on sisterly bonding and bickering, none of it very illuminating and without the satirical zing that buoyed the 1939 movie.Looking strangely youthful at 47, Meg Ryan seems to play Mary in a manner that tries to resuscitate the goodwill she engendered in the 1990's with "When Harry Met Sally" and "Sleepless in Seattle". It's not that she isn't age-appropriate here, but her familiar sprightliness seems at odds with the character's passive nature. Annette Bening fares somewhat better in the scene-stealing Rosalind Russell role of Sylvie because she has proved to be adept at conveying hardness while masking vulnerability, but her character goes through such a trite transformation that it undermines the actress' performance severely. Poor Eva Mendes has to play Crystal as a shallow, transparent shopgirl versus the smart, hard-edged cookie Joan Crawford got to play. Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith are scooted way to the sidelines as Edie and Alex, respectively. Much better are Candice Bergen as Mary's savvy, supportive mother and Cloris Leachman as the non-nonsense housekeeper.Probably reflecting the lackluster box office response to the film's release, the 2008 DVD doesn't have a robust set of extras. There are two deleted scenes - one with Crystal and her friends having a girls' night-in as a contrast to Mary's elaborate garden party, and the other an extension of Bette Midler's cameo as a multi-married Hollywood agent counseling Mary during a late night at a yoga camp. Two featurettes round out the extras" "The Women: The Legacy" about the history behind the film from the original 1936 play, and "The Women Behind the Women" which has the cast and crew speak endlessly about female self-empowerment and self-image. The irony is that this version of "The Women" directed and scripted by a woman takes such a patronizing look at women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best if you don't think about the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Women" uses the same character names and the plot skeleton of the 1939 George Cukor classic with the same title, but it is really more an alternate "Sex and the City" than an updated version the original. I found it neither as bad as its many detractors claim nor as good as its somewhat more limited number of fans make it out to be, but it's probably best if you are not terribly familiar with (or not a big fan of) the classic version. While that film has always been polarizing, even its critics recognize it has some of the snappiest, wittiest zingers in Hollywood history. Sadly, that sharpness is missing from the script of this film.And then there's the cast. I don't envy any group of actresses setting themselves up for comparison with the sensational ensemble of the original. This cast sounds impressive on paper, but they never really gel. It took the "SATC" women several seasons of hard work to develop as individual characters that come together so smoothly. Ryan, Bening, Messing, and Pinkett Smith can't manage the same feat in two hours, especially not when saddled playing cardboard stereotypes representing different aspects of whatever the filmmakers think "the modern woman" is. Not one of these characters, for all the talents of the actresses playing them, ever actually felt like a real person.That said, there's some life here, scattered scenes that are amusing or touching. The four leads are ably assisted, especially by Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen, in beautifully played roles that ring true. And Bette Midler steals the too-brief chunk of the movie she gets, giving us a hint of how brass and sassy a genuine attempt at updating "The Women" might have been. Unfortunately, Eva Mendes then comes back on screen, reminding us of how beneath Joan Crawford's Crystal Allen her version is, and how much this movie pales in comparison. (Not that it's all Mendes's fault -- true, she's no Joan Crawford, but her role here is a shadow of what Crawford got to sink her teeth into.) If you like chick flicks (I'm a guy, but I tend to) and you're not hoping for anything close to the original, then give it a go. Just don't expect too much. Everyone else, don't waste your time.</fullReview>

I love Candice Bergen, surprisingly Debra Messing, BUT Meg Ryan as Mary Haines, Eva Mendes as Crystal Allen, and Annette Bening as Sylvia Fowler are lamentable. 2. Crystal Allen/Eva Mendes is painful, really bad, and should be noted as the worst of the bunch. 3. The delightfully catty look at society wives is changed into a run of the mill girly ra-ra movie. The spirit of the original is totally perverted. 4. The exposed zippers in the fashion scene was awful. Edith Head would roll in her grave. The best scene was the delivery room scene.

I don't think this movie should have been remade at all. Diane English is an idiot. I certainly hope that filmmakers are not umping on this remake bandwagon intent on reviving all the classics. Modern takes on classic films have proved to be box-office bombs, and this is certainly no exception. The sad thing is that loads of people who love the original version will go to see this, holding a tiny gleam of hope in their hearts, and will leave angry, having paid their money into the box office, for which their is no recourse. Even if the movie is complete crap, the box office taking are the only sing of a movie's success, despite the fact that over half of the audiences leave in a very bad mood, having just wasted perfectly good money on a terrible film.</fullReview>

I admire most of the actresses involved and they should have stuck to the original storyline and they could have made a good remake of the original script, but it was perfect as it was.

		<fullReview>It was a great movie, one that I was able to watch multiple times because the storyline is intriguing, though it answered the questions that needed to be answered, and left some details about "What happened to..." to the imagination. The dynamics of Mary and Sylvie's friendship was real, and the 4 friends bond was genuine as well. The characters all had an identity which seemed to go beyond the screen. The Women is a drama-- comedy, one which had enough drama to keep me interested, but not too much comedy that the substance of the film was lost, a balance not always achieved in movies today. Definitely a movie you could watch more than once without being bored or losing interest, and the all female cast was an idea that could easily make or break a movie, but casting was not at all an issue, in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) has a big luncheon for all the high society women and her friends. Her husband cheats on her with Saks salesgirl Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes), and her friend Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) knows it. Her world falls into chaos when she finds out, and the affair continues.This is a remake of the 1939 movie made from a play. There are only female actors and female characters in the movie. I guess it's suppose to make a statement, but whatever statement it made in 1939, it no longer makes today. The dialog has a lot of superficiality in it, and the characters are stereotypes. It's all very 'Sex in the City', and it does not start off well. The problem is that when something actually happens, the seriousness is lost.Haines finding out about the affair could have been a very compelling story. It's nothing ground breaking, but going through it without a male character in sight is interesting. Her teen girl could be a great avenue for an emotional story. But it is all very fake. It's all very weak. It's not daring enough. Director Diane English has made a big screen unfunny sitcom with some pretty good actresses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Invisible Men</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much Woody Allen style soul-searching and social satire surrounds this fairly simple story about an upscale she-pack who discover that one of their members has a cheating husband. And, of course, they need to provide her with emotional, if not moral, support.The surreal gimmick in this film is that, with one exception, the entire cast of The Women is female, not just the major players but the extras. All the waiters and diners in a crowded restaurant are women. We are not, however, talking about a female version of The Hunt for Red October because there are men central to the story even if they are talked about like Niles Crane's Maris, never seen or heard. And that's just as well because they are the bastards who cheated. When Mary (Meg Ryan) finally throws out her philandering husband, the confrontation is relayed second-hand to us via the maid. The daughter watches sadly as dad's possessions are tossed out on the lawn.A more accurate title would have been The New York City Women because of the sad plight of that particular demographic who find that men and love are getting to be a scarce commodity. The invisible men in this film are a metaphor for real-life statistics. In NYC men are only 47 percent of the population. In college 40 percent are men. Even fewer of them want to get married. And of the ones who will marry, half will stray. Is it any wonder that women might have the feeling that men are disappearing? Mothers in fly-over land laugh at these big-city broads agonizing over the balance of career and family because even though they may have never been to Saks, at least their daughters aren't smoking cigarettes to keep their weight down, getting tattoos or studying to be hookers. Mary barely gives her daughter the time of day but kids need pretty much full-time adult supervision. With absent fathers and mothers who divide their time between boutiques, career and lunch with friends, the supervision is getting pretty spotty.It isn't really the women who are at fault, it's the men. Back around 1968 women knew what they wanted, they wanted to get married and have children. How tedious and boring. The guys have always known what they want -- boys just want to have fun. They bought the message of their leader, Hugh Hefner, and suckered women with a Three-Card Monte game of "feminism". Women thought they were picking the Queen of Diamonds but got the Joker instead.Some people might think this obsession women have with love, relationships and marriage is somehow trivial but it really is the most important thing in the world. The birth rate in the Western world is declining and has fallen below the replacement rate in several countries. We worry about declining populations of Spotted Owls or White Whales but what about the White Human? The final minute of this film makes it clear, if we don't get this business right, not only will the men disappear but all of us will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women of the 1930s changed to Women of the 2000s: Not A Good Renovation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to the overt commercialization (branded products throughout the entire running time) what I found most irritating about 'The Women' was the forced modernization and the caricaturing of these so-called modern women. The film is full of clichés: a) 4 girlfriends where one is a workaholic, one loves children, one is a desperate housewife and then the token black friend and token lesbian friend (these two are combined into one character). b) branded products appearing constantly. c) less focus on the friend who likes babies. d) portraying modern women as whiny e) the irritating teen daughter etc etc. Some of the characters and their subplots look forced, like the Bette Midler track. English's direction feels rushed and had she focused on character and plot development rather than which brands to get on screen, 'The Women' might have ended up being something slightly more meaningful. However, the film does have its share of good points. It was fun to watch so many hot and talented actresses share the screen. That can hardly ever be a bad thing. There are no men in the movie, which I don't mind and the title suggests it anyway. 'The Women' suggests being about the four friends but the focus seems to be only on Mary and Sylvia. Meg Ryan does a decent job. Her role is similar to what she played in 'In The Land Of Women' (which was a far superior movie) where she did a phenomenal job. Likewise, Annette Bening too does an equally good job but these are far from her and Ryan's best. Poor Debra Messing hardly has a role but she does make you chuckle in a few sequences. I feel even sorrier for Jada Pinkett who has nothing more to do than play the token black-and-lesbian friend. I felt it was Cloris Leachman who acted best as Mary's housekeeper. Her comic timing and response are wonderful. Eva Mendes nails her part as the other woman. Candice Bergen, Carrie Fisher, Bette Midler and Debi Mazar are nice additions. Perhaps this movie is strictly for fans of the actresses because I wasn't as bothered by it as many others and I do not think it's among the worst films but it's far from great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Debi Mazer, Debra Messing and Cloris Leachman were great in this film. Eva Mendes was also pretty damn funny. JP Smith was too "hood" to be believable in that group.I appreciated the problems Annette Bening was having at work, with an assistant who was smarter than she was and the pressures to perform and please her boss. It was nice to see something more complex than "Think Pink" and martini luncheons. Her career brought her real issues.The problem with this film was Meg Ryan's character. She was having a marital problem but she wasn't at fault in any way even when her friends suggested at dinner that she might be part of the problem. At the end of the film, the only fault she can acknowledge to her husband is that she gave up her career (a problem now solved) for her marriage. Where is the character development? Why would her husband come back to her? She's a spoiled brat.How fortunate for the brat that Candice has "that inheritance she never used" hanging around somewhere so Meg's character could rent the large workspace and all the assistants. "No, Mom, I couldn't accept that,well, OK".Meg straightens her hair, makes up with Annette, starts a business overnight, yells at her mysteriously contrite husband on the phone. Problem solved! This film has some nice, fairly complex statements to make but the only thing Meg learns is "I shouldn't have given up my career". Too easy. Cloris should have spanked her and sent her to her room.Sure, Mendes' character is spoiled but at least she's sexier. Advice to non-appearing husband: Stay with Eva till Meg's character grows up. Use condoms!</fullReview>

And one other thing, Meg is the one who dresses worst in the movie and she becomes to be a great fashion designer? The only fun thing about the movie is the fact that no male actors appear just until the end of the movie, and then a newborn boy appears and all the women come around him as it is the most precious thing in the world-the man, not the baby.

		<fullReview>When I saw that a TV station was airing a REMAKE of The Women, last night, I anticipated the worst--after all, the stylish original from the 1930's was such fun, that I couldn't imagine how any modern remake could possibly live up to it. I expected it would be so dreadful and politically correct that I'd turn it off within 20 minutes and go to sleep.Instead, I was pleasantly surprised by a film which was engaging and enjoyable, and which, while BORROWING many of the plot elements from the older film, retold a rather different story, and adhered, almost in a playful manner, to some of the "disciplines" of the original movie, such as never allowing a male to appear on screen.What really saves this movie is the first-rate performance of Annette Bening, who plays a character named Sylvia Fowler, but who otherwise is a completely different woman from the broad clown character Rosalind Russell created in the older film, with an utterly different story. A similarly successful "transplant" is of Mary Haines' mother, here portrayed wonderfully by Candice Bergen--and another is the role of Edie, here played by Debra Messing (who does give us the sort of broad clowning that we had for that role in the old movie).One real DISAPPOINTMENT in these updated roles was Bette Midler, who played the character corresponding to the Countess de Lave, expansively and noisily played by Mary Boland in the old movie. The script didn't go into the fun sub-plot of the Countess's boyfriend and his infidelities, and so this character, and its very fortunate casting, remain very tangential; similarly, Cloris Leachman manages to rescue a microscopic role of one of Mary's household staff--but should have been given much more to play with.Meg Ryan, although turning in a fine performance, is somewhat eclipsed by the talents around her.However, even though it lacks the style and impact of the classic film, I enjoyed this remake quite a bit, and can recommend it. It won't spoil the old film for you--it's too different from it--and yet, will give you several of your favorite moments from the old film refreshed and renewed, as well as a very different approach to others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just terrible; an insult to the actors and the 1939 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't bother. It's awful -- the script and the acting. Given the stellar cast, I expected better, especially from Annette Bening. Cloris Leachman was good, and that's about it. Interestingly, two of the scenes of the ladies walking down the sidewalk past high-end shops were filmed in Boston on Newbury Street. One of those scenes has Burberrys in the background. The characters seemed wooden. Even Bette Midler was a disappointment, though she didn't have a great script. And Eva Mendez was horrible...just horrible. For comparison, see the 1939 version if you haven't. It's much tighter, better acted, better filmed and better scripted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>On the plus side ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Women', originally a play by Clare Boothe Luce, was filmed in 1939 (with Norma Shearer as Mary Haines and Joan Crawford as Crystal Allen), in 1956 (as a musical, 'The Opposite Sex', with June Allyson as Kay Hilliard and Joan Collins as Crystal Allen), and now with Meg Ryan and Eva Mendes as Mary and Crystal.The story has been slightly updated - Stephen regularly phones Mary's mobile, Sylvie (Annette Bening) is the editor of a fashion magazine, one of the circle of friends is a lesbian - but the basic premise (and that is the plus) is still there, complete with some scenes verbatim from earlier versions (especially the changing room confrontation).There's also the mother giving words of wisdom (Candice Bergen, who is only slightly less plastic looking than Meg Ryan herself), but with some irony, while Bette Midler plays the much-married rich lady (once a Countess, played with aplomb by Mary Boland, now an actor's agent) who pursues the mysterious Buck Winston. There's also nice support from Cloris Leachman as the Haines' housekeeper.Like the 1939 version, no men appear in this film other than one baby boy. Even the dogs are bitches. It however suffers from colourless playing of the leads, in particular Eva Mendes, and from a lack of humour. So it is a reasonable remake, but ultimately a bit pointless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women only (in the cast, I mean). Delightful fun!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was flabbergasted by the negative critics starting this long list of reviews. I think their mistake was to compare this movie with the old original.They have nothing to do with each other. The original one is a classic, I love it fondly. This movie is based on the same novel, but it's absolutely contemporary. Another time, another way of thinking, another set of rules to move in society with. The old elegance in clothes, the distinguished looks, the excellent manners, all gone..., gone with the wind. But let's face it, our concept of contemporary elegance is what it is, nothing will make us go back to the 1930s idea of elegance, or manners, and if somebody resents that fact..., MMMmmmm, I'm afraid they are out of sync. with the present.Meg Ryan looks lovely; somebody complained that she cannot move her face... come on! what do you want her to do with it, a Cheeta number?? Her figure, and her legs! are first-class (so are Anne Benning's!!). The cast is excellent and as everybody complains about Eva Mendez, the original character is exactly like her. Joan Crawford in the old movie couldn't --at the time-- play it so coarse, because of censorship and simply because at that time they didn't portrayed reality as harsh as we use to do it today. Period.The movie is extremely entertaining, have some good laughs, the timing is excellent..., the photography flawless, the lighting impeccable, the sound perfect... anything else, El Exigente? I don't think these crew made this film pretending to surpass Antonioni, Visconti or Bergman. I enjoyed very much the 'women alone' dialogs, since they never act like that when even just one man is present. And the speed, spontaneity and sincerity of these dialogs indicate that only a woman could have directed this film. These group of women --with fantastic openness (something you will never find among men) when talking their hearts out, is so believable and attractive (at least to me), that I wanted this movie to go on forever!! They made a light --very light-- piece of entertainment, that's all. What really bothered me reading the critics written by men, was their necessity to clarify before hand that "This isn't the kind of picture I would go to see by myself... ME, such a macho man..., I saw it because..." (some excuse or other). Wow! are we tied up in knots, guys!! What is happening out there with those old fashioned ideas about what a man is about!! Wake up men, or we'll end up missing the boat irremediably!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The BEST version of this story ever filmed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like a lot of people familiar with some of the reviews, I had prepared myself for a flat remake full of catty women priding themselves on being put down artists. I didn't plan to see this movie. It was almost by default that I did. In fact, if it hadn't been playing around the corner at a second run movie theater (and at discount prices) I wouldn't have seen it. After all, I'm not a particular fan of anyone in the cast. Like a lot of people I thought, what are all these rich actresses doing remaking this dated story? I'm not a big fan of the original 1939 Cukor version either. Yeah, the comedy plays well on screen but in reality, no friendship could survive the way those women treated each another. The June Allison musical remake of the 50's is as gaudy and depressing as any movie ever made, so going in I already had a bias against this type of thing. LET IT BE KNOWN, no matter what you've heard about THE WOMEN 2008, it is DEFINITELY the best version of this story ever film. I think the people disappointed in this new version are the ones hoping to see these characters as they were portrayed in the original. Women backstabbing, cat fighting and sabotaging each other while exchanging quick catty put down lines. Director Diane English has not remade THE WOMEN of 1939, she has re-imagined the material into a film that actually MEANS something. A transformation of the old material that is full of new characters that, for the most part, are every bit as memorable as the ones in the 1939 version. The only similarity they have with the original are the names. This movie surprised me.If any story needed to be "re-imagined" for a present day audience, it's this one. I've never been a fan of Meg Ryan and I'm not a charitable audience in any movie, but Ryan completely won me over by the end of this film. These actresses know they're contending with a 1939 classic, but under the direction of English, they follow their own instincts and in doing so have redefined the characters and made them memorable and touching on their own. It's refreshing to see women on the screen presented this way. Grappling with decisions that will affect their lives, their families, their careers, their friendships and most importantly, their consciousness. Also refreshing is how English doesn't pander down to her audience. She gives us material that we have to rise up to. The characters are given decisions that we as an audience wonder what we would do in that situation. As a director, her pacing and edits are quick and assured. She knows the material and knows how she wants to present it. What elevates this film above the 1939 and 1956 versions are the ideas presented in it. The nasty cattiness between the women has been replaced with more thought provoking ideas. Only the manicurist, played by Debi Mazar stays true to the 1939 character. The rest of the cast are basically new characters with the same names. Eva Mendes is a knock out and not as hateful as the Joan Crawford characterization. Without question, the real surprise of this film is Annette Bening. English gives everyone a chance to shine in this film, but it is Annette Bening's character that gives the film it's center. If you're looking for a Rosaline Russell interpretation you're going to be disappointed. This is a new character and Bening makes her every bit as interesting and memorable as Russell made hers, only in a different way. I liked the way her character comes clean with Meg Ryan at the table about selling her out. I also liked the scene between Bening and her best friends daughter on the park bench. Equally as wonderful are the scenes of Bening pushing her ideas for the magazine on her reluctant associates and eventually selling her ideas out in order to save her job. I also thought it was smart on the part of English not to have a physical cat fight between these ladies. English winks at her audience by having Bening toss a banana at Meg Ryan and hitting her on the head, but only as a way of getting her attention. I also disagree the the criticisms of the way Bening looks in this film. She is nothing short of beautiful. Also wonderful is the casting of Candice Bergen as Meg Ryan's mother. The chemistry they display here seems an interesting extension of the mother and daughter roles they played in 1981's RICH AND FAMOUS. Jada Pinkett Smith is very likable and Carrie Fisher is memorable in her one scene. I could have done without the final baby sequence at the end of the picture and I had problems with the casting of Bette Midler. In all fairness, the audience in the screening I saw this movie in loved that baby delivery sequence, but I'm a guy and it kind of grossed me out. Bette Midler has become one of those actresses that thinks she can do no wrong in a movie, but whether it's the part as written or her acting, I was uncomfortable watching her. Her delivery of the "lamour, l'amour" line lands with a thud if you're familiar with the '39 original. OK, so this film did not fair well at the box office, but look for it to strike a cord and become popular on television. The message of this movie being that one does not need to be in a relationship to feel complete. You can be complete on your own, whether you're a man or a woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>please do not waste your time, money or life by seeing this film. i don't know what possessed me. a friend invited me so i thought i'd go with an open mind. i am not exaggerating - it was the most painful experience of my life.these are just a tiny fraction of my reasons for my opinion: 1 - there was nothing likable about any of the characters. they were all 1 dimensional, boring, stereotypical, very unattractive etc etc 2 - the script was the most clunky, forced, unbelievable piece of writing i have ever bore witness to. and i have seen a lot of 'poundshop classic'. 3 - there was not a single man in it. not even a walk on / extra part. i know that was obviously a really radical girl-power idea by the director but its a stupid idea. and its not even radical. 4 - on the subject of extras, if you do happen to watch this shocker, observe the extras. they are the funniest part of the film. 5 - i can't believe that this film was directed by a women. I'm sure she doesn't know any women or has never interacted with one. 6 - meg Ryan's hair, meg Ryan's face. in no particular order. 7 - Bette Midler played Bette Midler. 8 - the terrible, unbearable scene when Midler offered a joint to Ryan. why oh why. 9 - potentially good films don't get the backing to get made because money goes into awful drivel like this. 10 - the bags under Eva Mendes' eyes. i have not seen the original so i am not some anti-remake type. my favourite film is a remake. i just hated this film so much it makes me want to say a swear. its not even one of those films that you have to check out just to see how bad it really is. please take my word for it and leave it at that. don't even watch it when its on TV. pretend it doesn't exist because i certainly will.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the trailer for this film and remembered many big female stars in the cast, it is based on an original 1939 film directed by George Cukor, I knew it was rated two out of five stars by critics, but I was still intrigued by what it would involve. Basically clothing designer Mary Haines (Razzie nominated Meg Ryan) appears to be the perfect woman, living in beautiful suburban Connecticut with wealthy Wall Street financier husband Steven and eleven year old daughter Molly (India Ennenga), she is kind, and she can balance her work, including voluntary, and family. Mary's best friend since college is New York City fashion magazine editor Sylvie Fowler (Razzie nominated Annette Bening), who is unsure what to do when she finds out, from chatty manicurist Tanya (Batman Forever's Debi Mazar), that Mary's husband is involved with perfume salesgirl Crystal Allen (Razzie nominated Eva Mendes). Sylvie confides in heavily pregnant Edie Cohen (Razzie nominated Debra Messing) what to do as she still cannot bring herself to tell Mary, but Mary finds out for herself getting a manicure from chatty Tanya, her mother Catherine (Miss Congeniality's Candice Bergen) urges her to keep quiet for a while, but Mary ignores her and confronts Crystal first, then Steven and asks for a divorce. Sylvie, Edie and lesbian writer Alex Fisher (Razzie nominated Jada Pinkett Smith) come together to support Mary, but Sylvie faces losing her job, and after conspiring with local gossip columnist Bailey Smith (Carrie Fisher) the friendship between her and Mary is ended because of her betrayal, but Sylvie is the one who daughter Molly confides in while ditching school and her distracted mother distances herself. With the financial assistance of Catherine, after being fired by her father, Mary gets a makeover and decides to open her own clothing design firm, getting her life back in order she is also able to reconnect with her daughter, who talks about what she knew about her father's relationship with Crystal, and Mary reunites with Slvie who has quit her job. Mary sets out to repair her marriage and unveils her new line of womenswear in a fashion show, with Annie Lennox's "Money Can't Buy It" playing, attended by boutique owners and a buyer from Saks Fifth Avenue, Sylvie reveals she has met the right man and plans to give him her phone number, and Edie has her waters break and goes into labour. During the labour Mary gets a call from Steven and arranges with him to go on a date, Edie gives birth to a baby boy, and in the end the four friends Mary, Sylvie, Edie and Alex are on the cover of a new magazine started by Sylvie, called "Sylvie", Alex publishes her book, there is a hint Crystal is dating Alex's ex-girlfriend Natasha (Natasha Alam), and the women all talk about the joys, heartaches and uniquely special triumphs of being a woman. Also starring Bette Midler as Leah Miller, Young Frankenstein's Cloris Leachman as Maggie, Boogie Nights' Joanna Gleason as Barbara, Lynn Whitfield as Glenda Hill and Ana Gasteyer as Pat. It is nice to see all the big name female stars on screen together, but it is the same old chestnut, the star power ultimately rules this picture, there is hardly any effort to make laughs, and the rest is either trying engage with silly womens' problems (no pun intended) and bitchiness, and even sillier sentimentality, I will definitely have to see the 1939 original version, a bland and rather forgettable comedy drama. Adequate!</fullReview>

I only gave it a "3" because I liked some of the songs in it and some of the staging, sets, etc. I'm wondering if the problem is that they took all of these dynamic actresses and perhaps they were all just too big to be together? It seemed like the acting was forced and way to over-the-top. These women didn't really seem to mesh for me - their friendships weren't believable. In addition I'm so freaked out by Meg Ryan anymore. I used to love her, but now it seems like there is only 1 character she can play. And what is with her face? It all just makes her unwatchable. This was such a disappointment - what a waste. I kept looking at the clock, wondering when it would be over.</fullReview>

I know many say they tried to make it much like the original, but the important characters were way off, especially with the Sylvia Fowler as well as the other friends. Sylvia Fowler's character was much better played in the 1930's version. This whole movie/idea was much better for for the 1930's but not for 2008. I honestly wish there was some more originality in Hollywood these days where they did not have to continue with re-making all of these movies, and doing such a poor job. Just my opinion.

		<shortDescription>Pointless trash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really hate this movie, but not because it strays from the original. I'm often annoyed by people who criticize a film solely on how well it relates to its source material. I don't care about whether a remake is true to its original as long as the film can stand on its own merits. This film does not.The writer here clumsily pulls pieces out of the original, but for no reason! Nothing in this dog of a movie happens for any good reason. There was ample opportunity to make a compelling story here, but none of it is realized. Just when you think something interesting is going to happen, it doesn't. As long as you're going to cut and paste pieces out of the original, why not grab some of the timeless parts: like have Crystal mess around with Buck and ruin her stolen meal ticket! The little Haines girl overhears her flirting on the phone, and leaks the scandal back to her mother. Sorry, I guess something compelling and relevant to the story would have taken too much time away from the fashion career plot line. Instead, many of the worst elements of the original are preserved: like how important money is and how inheriting a bunch of it can solve all your problems. Don't forget to reinforce the importance of social status, and where you shop.Please, movie industry: hire some writers. Your business is supposed to be all about telling stories. The casting here is great, but the plot stinks, and none of the characters remain true to themselves. I like these actresses and thought they did fine, considering the lines they were handed. But the 10 best actresses in existence running around disjointedly rehashing a few lines from a classic movie doesn't merit my 5 bucks on pay-per-view.This movie is junk. It makes me sad, because it's such a glaring example of what's wrong with the whole industry. It's why more and more often, I browse production years rather than titles when looking for something to watch, because the newer it is, the more likely it is to sound like it was written by a 5th grader.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed watching this movie. No, I'm not gay, but I do enjoy watching "chick flicks". First off this movie would have been better as a straight to DVD rental with a lesser known cast. That being said, the only reason this movie was being shown in theaters is because of who the actresses were. I felt that the talent of these actresses were squandered on such a formulaic and predictable film. I give this film a 6 out of 10 stars because despite all it's misgivings I enjoyed the film. I'm glad I rented it, I wouldn't buy this movie, but I definitely think it's worth renting. One of the best surprises was the switch of Eva Mendes from the sweet lovable leading lady that she usually plays, to the mean, conniving and manipulative woman that she plays in this film. If you are fan of any of these actresses, you might be a little disappointed and maybe a little angry at the director.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very bland attempt at making the perfect chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never seen the original film and likely never will. In fact I had never even heard of the original 1939 "classic" that suddenly everyone seems so passionate about when describing how film makers butchered this remake compared to the original. Kudos must be given where it is due and there are some key points where the film achieves it's point in targeting it's demographic...women. And if the theater I was in was any indication (where I was literally the only guy in a full theater of women) they thought it was hilarious. They were certainly enjoying it more than what most reviews would imply both professionally and IMDb'ers. The cast is too big and the actresses perhaps too strong on screen that they don't clash with each other but the writers tone down each character to near boredom essentially ruining any attempt at depth that could have existed in the story and the characters. Considering the film exists literally entirely of women...not even in the background will you see a man for even a second, it's quite an accomplishment actually and a very interesting spin on the genre, and then considering that the film is marketed towards women...the film still comes across to me as male dominated but that's a different argument for a different forum.Meg Ryan changes very little over the years which can be a great thing if you're a huge Meg Ryan fan which we all have been at one time or another. But same old does become...same old...and her performance as Mary Haines, the scorned wife who is trying to take her life back is the quasi-ditsy, blonde, cute, curly haired role we've seen her in a dozen times or more. Her character gets some depth compared to others and she has her moments but the script is weak and she doesn't add to it. Annette Bening gets second closest to actually having some sort of depth to her character but she sticks out amongst the friends as being a little older and out of touch and never really takes off with any major improvements to the story. Debra Messing's character is funny and cute and could have really had a good storyline to go along with Mary's marital woes but they give her next to nothing other than a few good lines and funny moments. She gets to go into labor which helps give her the edge over the other women. Jada Pinkett Smith, I have no doubt, is a great actress. I think she has fabulous potential and she totally blew it on this film where she is literally completely useless. Meaning no offense to this at all...the film makers literally seemed to use her as the token black girl and on top of that the token lesbian/gay connection. Her character has no depth, no good lines, and is just angry through the whole thing. Eva Mendes does the best she can do as the tempestuous lover of Mary's husband. She is funny and quirky and does look very sexy but no depth just like everyone else. Add in some good solid cameos from Hollywood elite like Bette Midler (does she always do pot smoking advice cameos or is it just me?) Candice Bergen (love her), Carrie Fisher (unfortunately bland cameo), and the amazing Cloris Leachman (who might be one of the best characters in the film.) The movie turns in a cast that is sorta fun for the first half hour and then loses all credibility.I am just blown away that a woman director and writer like Diane English who created one of the most profound female roles in the nineties with Murphy Brown could create a movie for women, about women, with nothing but women, called The Women could make all the women in the film so neurotic and needy. I mean sure the moral of the film is supposed to be that you can survive without men but if that's the case why do they all seem to go insane? The movie is mildly entertaining and I don't mean to say that I didn't enjoy it I just thought it would be so much more and could have been a very powerful dramedy under the right circumstances but this wasn't it and my opinion seems to reflect that of the general consensus so check this one out on DVD maybe or wait for the TV to show it...then it won't be so bad. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart and well-updated, though maybe only for women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since the release of this film I have seen only negative reviews. In fact, even the summary given on this website is a summary of the 1930's version, as if nobody could be bothered to watch a modern film only about women. I would like to point out that the 1930's version was such a hit that it was remade in the 1950's with June Allyson as a musical. Obviously, some have found universal themes about the nature of female friendship, competition and betrayal to be worth watching. I watched this remake shortly after the film was released and I remember being surprised by how terrible the reviews were. I have recently watched it again, and find myself wondering the same thing. When Meg Ryan confides her husband's affair to her mother, Candice Bergan, and is advised to turn a blind eye, Ryan makes the comment, "What is this, a 1930's movie?!?" This is a clever bit of dialogue and reminds us of the movie's origin. Yes, it is a different time now, but I think this remake, while clearly not a perfect film and at times a bit awkward, does an admirable job of holding true to the themes that made the original a classic and for me it was a perfectly enjoyable film. After 13 years of a loving marriage and a beautiful daughter, a woman finds out that her husband is having an affair. The knowledge comes about through the gossip of high-society New York, in this instance the manicurist at Sak's. Her friends soon find out the news as well and act to intervene. I think one problem that people had with this beginning is that in the "modern" world this woman should have thrown her husband out immediately. She is counseled, however, by her mother, not to throw away everything over her husband's "mistake" which clearly has nothing to do with the love of his wife. Several years ago, I may also have found this idea offensive. I think, however, the film does a good job of justifying why a woman wouldn't want to give up everything her life has been about immediately. Obviously, once she is forced to confront the sexy mistress in a dressing room, the abstract idea of an affair becomes real and she throws her husband out. From here the film shows Ryan's struggle to move on; as her relationship with her friends, her job and her daughter all impose challenges. At the heart, however, remains the fundamental intricacies of all the different kinds of female relations, from her reticent housekeeper to the "other woman" and everyone in between (including a fabulous turn from Midler as a random acquaintance who passes on some vital wisdom). And here, at the heart, the movie shows it's modern grip on the female species: Ryan learns the ultimate lesson that a woman will never be the best daughter, mother, worker, lover or friend that she can be until she asks the real question: What does she want for herself? Again, I enjoy these kinds of themes, and though I wouldn't make my husband sit through it with me, I would definitely watch it again some rainy day. One more thing, the ultimate revenge scene is delicious! Lots of fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The women is an incredibly stupid film. This main women(played by Meg Ryan, Annette Benning, Jada Pinkett Simth, and Debra Messing) are retarded. It's like they are blind too. There is nothing really special about The women. The damndest thing about this film. It's plot seems oh so familiar. It's about four women, all friends, and they talk about their love life. In a city. Hmm... that sounds a little like Sex in the city? What is the difference between both films, and show? Well, The women is actually a remake of a 30's film. They should've left it alone. Really, the film is just plain awful.I have already told you most of the story. Four friends, one is a house wife(played by Meg Ryan, who looks very bad for her age do to botox), a business women(played by Annette Benning), a lesbo(played by Jada Pinkett Smith) and a woman trying to have even more kids(played by Debra Messing). They all live in the city. They are all friends. Now the movie has no men in it whatsoever. Not one. Not even in the background. That would've been nice. when the house wife's(Meg Ryan)husband is cheating on her for a perfume bitch(Eva Mendes, that's what they call her) it get's pretty stupid. As if it wasn't already. The really stupid thing about this movie is that her retarded friends didn't tell her about it and they try to convince her to stay with her husband. The acting is pretty bad. As is the whole movie pretty much. The movie makes women look like retards and men look like genius's. This movie is really stupid. What good will The women do for you? The most they'll make you do is once you finish the film, they'll make you take a bath to wash off all of the stink. It's just that horrible.The women:*/****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I sat down to watch The Women when I had some time to myself anticipating a fun 'chick' flick. How disappointing! Terrible trash from some of the big stars of Hollywood. I disagree with the others here of Meg Ryan--she looked great, whatever she is doing; she is aging but still looks attractive. But what of Annette Bening? She looked awful-bad makeup, bad clothes, the scarf for the neck, all of it. Check her out in The Grifters--drop dead gorgeous and sexy. The typical Mazar role. The pretty Debra Messing reduced to bad lady status. Eva Mendes I don't know but she looked a bit like Raquel in her day. But its not all about how bad they looked--the acting, the script;I cant think of one redeeming aspect of it. So what of Cloris Lechman,Bette, and Candice having some 'wise'words-no one talks or acts like this in real life and doesn't want to see it on film--its beneath us. I usually love a sweet funny lovely movie like Sleepless or most of Julia Roberts movies. I hope those who made this crap will listen and make something worthy of us whom seek something light but not embarrassingly bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a huge fan of the original version of "The Women." This version shouldn't even be allowed to be called a remake as everything about it is bad, so bad it made me see Jungle Red. First, the writing, Diane English should not be allowed to write movies as she is known for TV writing (Murphy Brown)a better choice would have been Nora Ephron. 2nd Mistake; Casting. Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Jada Pinkett, Annette Bening, a bunch of B-level actress trying to compete with the a-list actresses of the original. A Better Choice of casting would be this, Reese Witherspoon as Mary Hanes, Cher-Sylvia Fowler, Angelina Jolie-Crystal Allen, Bette Midler-Countess (with more scenes and lines) Jada Pinkett replaced with Halle Berry. Mary Hanes Mother(Candice Bergan)--Jane Russell, Debra Messing replace with Julia Roberts. If anyone wanted to remake this movie that would the ideal choice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another example of star driven waffle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wealthy Mary Haines (Ryan) leaves her husband after she finds out from her socialite friends he has been cheating with the attractive sales girl Crystal Allen (Mendes) Ryan, Bening, Mendes, Messing and Pinkett Smith are the stars in Diane English's adaptation of the hit 1939 hit The Women. All these big stars have had their names printed in the credits of some of the finest and memorable romantic comedy dramas over the last few decades. When Harry met Sally, American Beauty and Hitch to name just a few. So all have experience in the genre, all have won our hearts in their previous respective roles and are all therefore capable of regenerating their own personal magic, so why has the film plummeted with fans and critiques? This film is undoubtedly targeted towards women with an all female cast and concepts of dresses, relationships and dealing with life. Fair enough. It is easy viewing if your problems are reflected and managed in a different light and with your favourite stars it should be a worthwhile view. But reflecting realism is never the same with these films. The solutions appear too easy to match the running time, the problems are far from the truth and the inclusion of bad timing just generates a form of fantasy that should be banned from screen.The bottom line is that romantic comedies are so easy to make in recent times. He's just not that into you or Love Actually are some previous star driven previous releases that show films are woven around its stars rather than the plot and lack realism because of it. Romantic comedy dramas have the same generic style. Guy and girl get on fine; problems arise with a series of sub plots before finding problem and attempting a resolve. It just depends who you have to star that makes the difference these days.The Women is yet another perfect example of nonsense. Meg Ryan gets depressed when her husband is caught cheating and her friends feel guilty and her daughter doesn't respect her and she tries to balance her career as well and etcetera. It's ridiculous to even contemplate seeing this film when it's a carbon copy of every other romantic comedy or drama with stars from the gossip magazines.The plot is consistently flat and don't expect any humour to give you a good night's viewing. Pinkett's lesbian and the talkative manicurist may have your mouth twitching but that's as far as it goes.Flat, utterly pointless and a waste of time, money and effort, The Women is a perfect example of the ridiculous cinema trend that we have entered.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The entire time I was watching this movie I was thinking.." This should be a Nora/Deliah Ephron movie! Why isn't it?!". Seriously, if this movie would have been written &amp; directed by the Ephron powerhouses, Meg Ryan MIGHT have been better for the role. Maybe. She was Americas Sweetheart. The quintessential female romantic comedy star!! She could have played this movie in 2001, but seeing her on screen now is just horrifying to me. In the DVD extras in the interviews about women, Meg Ryan says it's about "real authenticity". How can she say that with an, although surgically enhanced, straight face?! I agree with everyone that the casting of this movie is completely absurd. I actually love Deborah Messing. Love Will &amp; Grace, love her comedic timing...in a television series. Seeing Annette Benning as the the first character was actually pretty scary. What's happened to her &amp; why is she in this movie? I was taking quadruple takes. It's like she was portraying a knock off Diane Keaton. The long coats, high collared necklines..says Diane Keaton all over it. Seeing her would've been a God-send. Unfortunately, I did not crack a single laugh this entire movie. Not even the Bette Midler part, which was a highlight considering the rest of the off casting. Seeing Meg Ryan smoke up with Bette Midler wasn't even funny. There are so many better matched women for this movie, that at this point could pass for A) having an 11 year old &amp; B) being friends with each other: Jennifer Garner, Renee Zellweger, Jennifer Aniston..this list could continue. This movie definitely could have been done so much better, with more thought &amp; effort into not only the cast, but the script &amp; the general direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very disappointing remake of the 1939 and 1956 film.You know something is wrong right away when it comes to the part of Sylvia Fowler. In both of the previous versions, Sylvia was a conniving, vicious woman who met her match when her marriage ended as well and she fell victim to Buck Winston. In this version, Sylvia is a career woman who gives advice to Mary's daughter? How ridiculous. Whatever happened to Buck Winston here?Remember the part of Crystal Allen, the witch who stole Steven Haynes away from Mary? She had some juicy part in both films and here she is merely relegated to one or two rather benign scenes.This film is proof that you can't take Clair Booth Luce's juicy book and try to update it to 2008 standards. Bringing in lesbians, career women and other modern problems doesn't do justice to this classic.In addition, Meg Ryan-you're no Norma Shearer or June Allyson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: The Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Written and directed by Diane English, which is based on both the stage play by Clare Boothe Luce and the 1930s movie of the same name, The Women is an update of sorts transplanting stories about the love lives of 4 women friends to modern day New York City, but wait a minute, isn't this Sex in the City?Not quite. For starters, this movie does not have a Mr Big. In fact, male characters get mentioned, but the high level of girl power meant that men are supposed to be mentioned, but never seen. Nada, zilch. In almost every scene you'll be hard pressed to find the male species in the movie, that you'll almost deem this a terribly sexist movie. The characters too seem like a throwback to SATC and while the characters here are less irritating and less bitchy, that however was part of the fun that was missing here.It's not a bad story, but Diane English had made this feel more like one's watching a stage play rather than a movie. Dialogue becomes lines delivered on cue, with little emotion attached. The plot itself was quite thin, and one could see the actresses trying their best to make their characters seem as three-dimensional and as interesting as they can. Some make the grade, while others like Jada Pinkett Smith, Debra Messing and Eva Mendes weren't given enough screen time to perform adequately.While it preaches girl power, solidarity, empowerment and the likes, what this film essentially is, is a Meg Ryan and Annette Bening show. It's been a long time since I last saw Meg Ryan grace the screen locally, and surprisingly, it didn't seem that she has aged a bit. I deliberately tried to look out for tell tale signs of wrinkles, but age has been extremely kind to her. Annette Bening got the opposite, as she has visibly aged a bit, then again, she plays the more alpha-type role here that seems to be the unsaid leader of the womanly pack.The characters here were a little like SATC's like a mentioned. Bening's Sylvia Fowler is a woman's magazine editor whose job is under threat from young upstarts brimming with fresh creativity. Ryan plays the all American lovely socialite wife Mary Haines juggling with family, career and various obligations, so much so that her husband finds enough time to engage in an extra-marital affair. Her story actually anchors the film and forms the pivot in which all other subplots revolve around. Eva Mendes plays the third party as cosmetics girl Crystal Allen, who hooks up with Mary's husband just because of his social standing and platinum credit card. The typical gold-digger, her role is a typical vamp but much of her screen time shenanigans has already been exposed in the trailers.Then there's homemaker Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) who's the mother hen of the lot with her many daughters, and is expecting once again, a task she'll not stop until she gives birth to a son. And Jada Pinkett Smith's Alex Fisher is a lesbian. Err, that's it, because I though Diane English had by the time ran out of ideas what to do with the latter two characters, that they get much reduced roles.It's a plain and simple narrative delivered without much fanfare, but bolstered by female actresses whom those in my generation would have seen them on screen for a fair bit. And I thought the budget was provided to engage the services of the likes of Candice Bergen, Carrie Fisher and even Bette Midler for guest roles, that there wasn't enough money left to hire male actors. So for a very focused and female centric film, The Women, like the title states, is all about the female of the species, the stereotypical woes that they face, and as with all things, everything can be improved with a change in haircut.Unfortunately this movie comes censored, and the unceremonious cut was during a crucial montage sequence where Ryan's Mary Haines picks up the pieces and redesigns her life. I suspect that there was a lot more to it than just the systematic straightening of her hair though. Oh and do stay tuned for the coda at the end of the credits. With some subtle product placement from Dove used during the film, the coda was more explicit, and even had this look and feel of a Dove ad, but of course with the four lead actresses explaining what it takes and feels like to be a real woman.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This bomb deserves all the rotten tomatoes hurled at it. The villain is Diane English who managed to obliterate all the humor and bitchiness that was the driving force behind the original play and film. The Sex and the City movie was so much more like "The Women" than this dullard. In fact, if English had enough imagination she would have revised the screenplay to be about a group of upscale ladies putting on the play (for charity) and drawing comparisons and contrasts between women of today and the 1930's characters. That would have allowed for much more of the outdated humor and attitudes to be included without destroying the original snappy/sappy dialogue. At least 2 of the cast managed to provide performances that far surpassed their material--Annette Bening and Candice Bergen.It was nice to see Bergen play Meg Ryan's mom, again. Everyone should check out "Rich and Famous" for a successful updating of a similar classic "Old Acquaintance."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Polished enough for genre viewers but too superficial and basic to appeal to a wider audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It appears I am alone on this site in seeing this film having never seen the 1939 original on which it was based and I watched mainly out of interest of what Meg Ryan has been up to and not out of a curiosity over how it stands up by comparison. In a way I guess this would have helped me because I was free from shadows of "classic" films but then at the same time the film still needed to be good to engage me. In this regard the film is "reasonably good" but nothing that is particularly special. It is worth noting that the reviews for this film in the UK press were mostly dismissive (or at least they were in the papers etc that I read) so my expectations were low so perhaps this is why I found the film to be reasonably good in spite of how simple it essentially is.You see this really is a very target audience affair that is meant to appeal to groups of female friends or mother/daughter combos looking to have a laugh and cry in a bonding fashion. In aiming for this group the film throws in all the genre standards and doesn't worry too much about the detail, how applicable it is and how well it all gels together. What this means is that the film has a broad sweep to it that is good enough to distract in a basic sort of way. Add to this the professional Hollywood sheen that money brings most films and a cast that is starry. The downside is that it does feel very episodic and superficial because it doesn't manage to have a lot of depth or realism within the characters. This was to be expected perhaps with this type of cuddly, daytime TV type product but it is hard not to have hoped for slightly more given the volume of famous actresses involved. Sadly the material hands them chunks of character rather than really letting them build them across the whole film ? so it does feel like we have had "that" scene and now we are moving onto "this" scene rather than watching a story.The cast do so-so work, mainly because they are matching the light "now we laugh now we cry" approach to the material and they mostly come across like they are acting the scenario rather than acting the people. Ryan is unsurprisingly bland ? it is something I had hoped she would break out I guess if you can't hit it in In The Cut then you're not going to lift your game for something like this. Bening is better and makes more of her character ? hardly a great turn but she does what she can. Messing is comic relief on paper but not in reality while Smith turns in a clichéd sexy lesbian character with all the invention and effort of someone ironing t-shirts (and also, is it healthy to be that thin?). Midler, Fisher, Leachman, Whitfield and a few others turn out without a lot of reason or impact while Mendez is left a thankless role of being sexy? a role she can do effortlessly but not often does she have to be the "baddie" while doing it. She doesn't convince because she is more of a fun flirty sexy and the evil man-eater just doesn't sit well on her.I didn't know The Woman was a remake until afterwards but whether it is directly taken from one source or many, the effect is the same because this is a film that is happy to cover its bases and not play dangerously. It ticks the genre boxes and turns out a polished enough "chick flick" (sorry ? hate that phrase) but it doesn't have much in the way of character, realism or depth to engage the viewer. For those who see this as a product that they will love then you probably will, but it is just too superficial to play to an audience that comes to it without minds already made up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Updating of the Clare Booth Luce play and the 1939 movie is a major disappointment. The cast of women is excellent, most of the individual scenes work but nothing hangs together. There is no connection from scene to scene almost as if the film was crafted in parts and then assembled in a vacuum. Granted the story of a woman dealing with her husband's infidelity and how she is helped and hindered by her friends is a less shocking one now in an age when divorce is so common, but at the same time its just as timely as ever, I just wish they could have managed to connect all of the pieces together because as it stands now you really don't feel pulled along by the plot.

I was out for a nice chick-date flick with my girl (my darling hubby likes watching movies together and I knew this wouldn't be his thing), something light and easy on the senses, but this was one bad movie. We are intelligent and interesting movie watchers and this movie wasn't that. Annette Benning is a great actress, she held her own. Bad. Bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An old friend and I go to the movies once a month and we gravitate to non-violent stories about people. I wished I had read the reviews here before I went. The trailers and the cast and English were what sent us out to see the Women. We are both over 50...just. We are both fairly well educated professionals. She is divorced I am married 32 years. When I am entertained, I just follow the movie. Last night all I was doing was finding faults...because that was all I saw. I had never even heard of the original...but now I will definitely seek it out.**SPOILERS only to what cast members played in each character ** The casting (however marvelous each of these actresses are and I am a fan of each and everyone) was too big name heavy. I happened to feel sorry for Candice Bergen. She was really very good, but at 62, she is tooo young to portray Meg Ryan's mother...what were they thinking! OH yeah...wait, Ms Bergen had already played Ryan's mother in a film back in 1981 for George Cuckor's last film "Rich and Famous". You've come a long way Candice, not so much Meg. This actress is like little Sally one note (pun intended). Cloris Leachman is magnificent and I was all smiles when she appeared. Annette Benning was also very good but again, was not a good pairing with Ryan. Debra Messing's character was a bit over the top, but there are so few comedies I would think she would jump through rings to be in this picture. Eva Mendez was stunningly and evilly cast. That was a good choice, and done well. Jada was cast for name only, I thought, not quite a part for her.Love Bette, but I would bet that a much of her contribution to this film was left on editing floor. She was a stereotype of herself, which was probably intended, but the lady can act, and they should have had her sing at least one of her songs in the soundtrack. Carrie Fisher? Now I know who she is, but I'm old. How did she get a part...(awful) India Ennenga played Meg Ryan's daughter. She was very good and I think we'll see more of her. But I hope casting directors don't judge her on the weight of this film or she is sunk. I read in some of these reviews about the absence of men. It was very effective. Also, the comment about the extras is also true...your mind wanders to them when you are bored with the action. There is one in purple in a scene with the manicurist. No director was paying attention to her at all :) Save your theater money and wait for this to come to TV...don't even bother to rent it. Or go or rent knowing you are paying for the big money cast, not Meg Ryan. Time to grow up dear and act your age.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately all of the top reviews you see of this movie are from fans of the 1939 movie. I love black and white films as much as anyone but seriously you need to let it go. "The Truth About Charlie" had to suffer from this same myopia. "Charade" is probably my favorite film of that period but I don't try to compare it with a film of this period. It is a completely different art form. With that out of the way let me say why I liked this film so much. Every actress in it reminds me of someone I know or touches a part of me and it does it with humor. While the setting and the culture of the movie is Manhattan its topic is one that touches every woman at one point in their life. What happens when a husband is unfaithful? What if you are the friend that finds out? Do you tell or not tell - either way you are going to lose? Different advice flows from everyone but at the end only one person can live with and make the decisions. The film centers around Meg Ryan who has some great lines and delivery but I must confess that Annette Bening was my favorite in the movie. She had the more difficult part to play and did it perfectly. This is a film I recommend if you want to be entertained and feel good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>George Cukor's The Women remains one of the glittering gems of 1939, Hollywood's most golden of golden years. The film crackled and sparked and it's absence of males was a subtle touch, hardly noticed because of all the fine entertainment.Flash forward. We see Fifth Avenue in New York City, in front of Saks. Large crowds bustle along the Avenue...but something's off. The shot reveals only well dressed (attractive and young) women. Creepier than I Am Legend, the visual concept continues, inside the store and later at a large fashion show. What NYC fashion show doesn't have at least 5 gay men? The "no men" rule is rammed down our throats creating an alien world, off balance and distracting.Enter Meg Ryan, first seen digging in her garden wearing a ridiculous get-up complete with her retro curls and flailing arms. I immediately sympathized with her husband and could understand why he looked elsewhere. Later in the film she morphs into an older Jennifer Aniston look and keeps her arms at her sides. This seems intentional as if to say "Look! I can still be relevant!" Ryan's character is loaded down with a coven of miss-matched friends (insert Sex and the City comparison here) who, if it were real life, would despise each other. Annette Bening plays the power bitch, who during the course of the film realizes her life's dream doesn't really make her happy. Jada Pinkett Smith is the power lesbian, all atitudinous with no use for any of the men who aren't there. Debra Messing is some sort of baby factory that eats a lot. Eva Mendes is an odd choice for the bad girl to say the least. She looks fake, acts fake and any humor she tries to demonstrate falls flat. Someone's comment on here that she looked trans-gender was spot on. Other various stars show up, to rearrange the furniture on this Titanic.The only thing that would have saved this would have been the brilliant casting of Jennifer Aniston and Angelina Jolie. They could have named their price, tucked their tongues firmly into their cheeks and pulled off something very clever and profitable. But no, Hollywood thinks of itself way too highly for that kind of exploitation. Instead we're given this thing that lumbers along awkwardly with no sparkle. Entire sections of dialog from the original are lifted and plopped down into a scene with awful results. At one point Ryan exclaims something along the lines of, "This isn't a 1930's movie!" No Meg, it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why bother?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Women" is one of the best classic films of 1939, a glorious year for the American cinema. Based on the witty Clare Booth Luce theatrical play, is one of those works that are better left alone since the definite version by the great George Cukor, with a screenplay by Anita Loos, will never be better, as seems to be the case with this misguided effort.Diane English, the creator of "Murphy Brown", serves as the director for this updated take on Ms. Luce's work. One can understand her admiration for trying to bring up to date this timeless play. Unfortunately, what was relevant in 1939 feels boring and somewhat inadequate today. Then again, Ms. English cast, with a few exceptions, pales in comparison with the players of the original movie. One can see why this feminist play, way ahead of its times keeps attracting new audiences.One feels sad for the waste of talent in the film. Meg Ryan, who was so amazing when we last saw her at Katz's delicatessen, is not in the same league as Norma Shearer. For that matter the Crystal of Eva Mendez equals Joan Crawford's performance. While Ms. Crawford was the epitome of the calculating beast she was, Ms. Mendez seems vulgar and cheap. We feel as though Annette Benning, especially, and Candice Bergen have been totally misused in the overall picture.Watch the original George Cukor film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one good thing about this picture...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought Debi Mazar was steller as the Saks nail tech. She was the only one who brought any of the charm from the original to this wretched cinemabomination.I adore Eva Mendes but casting a bombshell/SUPERVIXEN! as Crystal totally took the fire out of the dynamics of the characters and sent it reeling into a totally clichéd arena. In the original, viewers had to wonder why Stephen would leave sweet Mary for a crafty shop girl and were led to believe that something was really wrong in their marriage. Both viewers and Mary were left to figure out just what went wrong. But one look at Eva and all mystery vanished. Stephen was just a typical low-down dirty dog who was helpless against the power of boobs. Joan Crawford's Crystal was way more menacing because she was everywoman. It is way more frightening to think that you could loose your man to your average shop girl, waitress, receptionist, etc. How do you fight back against that? You are more vulnerable when it isn't about looks. Joan Crawford was attractive, but for 1939 she was no Rita Hayworth, and certainly no where near Eva Mendes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Near the end of "The Women" I was thinking that there isn't one single frame of the movie with a man in it, or at least I was almost sure about it; or sure enough not to go back and check the images of the film and find out. It is a horrible movie, and not in the sense that it looks bad, in the sense you use to refer to a very bad movie. Because the argument plays like a romantic comedy, blame me if I think that the charming smile of someone like Richard Gere (or Dermot Mulroney, possibly) could have made it a little better, or more romantic.It's not easy to deal with female friendship in movies; it's less easy if the women aren't young and even less easy if there are no men around to complicate things. Writer/director Dane English, in a sort of remake of a movie I haven't seen, plays with all of these elements in "The Women", as Mary's (Meg Ryan) friends, Sylvia (Annette Bening), Edie (Debra Messing) and Alex (Jada Pinkett Smith) find out her husband is cheating on her and start acting like teenagers, visiting the place the lover in question (Eva Mendes) works at.Now I still can't decide if English has the wrong eye for comedy or romance, or if he just suffers of a bad ear. There's not a single laugh in the whole movie until the final scene, in which Messing gives us a scream that could compete with Ryan's famous fake orgasm in "When Harry met Sally"; and there's no hint of romance, because English never lets us see the ones to blame for these women's pain which, at least in this film, are always men. We can't even feel empathy for Mary, because Mendes' lover walks sexy and doesn't seem to have the fault for what happened, and there's a dramatic approach of a mother-daughter relationship that never works; partly because of an inexpressive India Ennenga (as Ryan's daughter) and a script that most of the time is too corny.I had written some shameful lines of the screenplay but I lost them somewhere. The problem here with the friendship (mainly the one between Mary and Sylvia, the Bening character) is that everything is too much and too shallow, as Mendes points accurately in one of the film's best scenes. Don't get confused, the characters are credible, but they are all extreme. And maybe we can rescue the director for some performances that are worth mentioning, even if it seems it will never end.Thanks to Bening's work (in something similar to what Meryl Streep achieved in the equally awful "The Devil Wears Prada"), Sylvia doesn't seem like a machine and her neurosis brings the movie to life from time to time. Messing's performance, with her four kids and all the food she can eat, is heartfelt; so is Ryan's. Pinkett Smith suffers of a stereotyped character, but she gets the best out of her lesbian. There's a sincere appearance by Candice Bergen as Mary's mother and an unbearable scene with Bette Midler.The best performance though, comes from Cloris Leachman, as a housekeeper who knows about life and still has the spice of life with her. She's fabulous, and we can still thank cinema for women actors, but we could never thank cinema for "The Women".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A mediocre remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the remake of The Women (1939) was announced,I decided to see the original film when,as a coincidence,it was transmitted on TV.I liked it pretty much,not only for its story and performances,but also for the contrast of the sexual politics of that moment and now.The remake resulted to be pretty mediocre and a wasted opportunity.One of the few elements I liked on this weak remake was the cast.Meg Ryan,Annette Bening,Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett-Smith fit on their roles very well.But my favorite performances are the ones from Candice Bergen,Carrie Fisher and the brilliant Cloris Leachman.But,in spite of the good cast,I did not like this movie because of its various negative points.For one sight,the screenplay is not decided between making a copy of the original film or laughing at it.Screenwriter Diane English (who also makes her first work as a director) is famous for having created the TV series Murphy Brown and My Sister Sam,which are intelligent portraits of women facing the modern world,without obsessing about the "male control",but without ignoring the sad realities from that situation.However,the women from this film define their lives because of the men and they are free on many aspects but they feel slaves of the men.I am obviously saying this from a male perspective,so a woman may lead to another conclusion that mine.What I wanna say with my conclusion,is that the film wasted the opportunity of bringing a honest and realistic message.Besides,the film bored me pretty much and the ending is tremendously ridiculous.The element which most bothered me from this movie is its lack of ambition : instead of making an update of the story and the message from the original movie,it only made an update of the clothes and cars.Although the cast from this movie is good,I cannot give this film a recommendation because it bored me pretty much and it represents wasted potential.Try to see the original film,which is much more interesting and entertaining than this weak remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Watching the trailer of "The Women"-with an all star cast, I thought this film could be the next "Sex and the City". Boy, was I in for a disappointment.During the first half I got the impression, something is very wrong. The footage looks dull, there is very little camera movement and even the score was bad. The times where there was actually music. There should have been more comedy, the story has a lot of potential. Certain shots and editing are distracting! The extras also helped to distract us. Everyone doing their own thing.Well, it's good to see great films and as a filmmaker the bad ones are there for us to learn from! When the time comes for our RomCom to move forward.Not all hope is lost. The second half is actually better and Jada Pinkett Smith gives an outstanding performance as always!</fullReview>

The original was far more clever, if slightly vicious and dated. And what on earth did Meg Ryan do to make herself so unattractive and emotionally unappealing??! (Can you say bad plastic job? Uh-huh. Forget the fat lips, girl.) Moreover, there's not one major character (or characterization) that I find remotely sympathetic or can care about -- I want to slap them all! Don't care for the wimpy, spineless Meg Ryan character or the superficial Annette Bening character. Really don't like the Bette Midler character (or is it what Midler does with it? It's a toss-up). Hate, hate, **HATE** the Debra Messing character!! Eva Mendes? Flat. Boring. Could do entirely without Cloris Leachman: she just irritates lately wherever she is. And Jada Pinkett Smith is practically invisible in this.Skip this. Waste of time. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A decent film that just can't help but pale in comparison to its original.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>George Cukor's 1939 masterpiece The Women is one of my all time favorite films. Diane English's 2008 Women is a mildly diverting chick flick that is less a remake of George Cukor's film and more like Ice, that episode of The X-Files where they did their own version of The Thing. Diane English's film is essentially a Sex &amp; the City episode based on the screenplay for The Women, the basic plot machinations are similar, many of the sets are the same, but it's not the same film. When the first film credited the women under their husband's names (i.e., "Mrs. Stephen Haines" instead of "Mary"), it was being sarcastic. Here, we're introduced to the characters...by their expensive shoe brands.That's the big shift of the film that weakens its power: where the original mocked its aloof, jittery characters who based their lives around fashion and men (and how much empty nonsense filled their lives), this film, like its contemporary inspiration, wants you to sympathize with them and think of them for two hours as your girlfriends, mmhmm. Meg Ryan and Eva Mendes do okay-decent-I-guess jobs with their antagonistic roles, and does fix the one (less-than-serious) problem that kept driving me nuts with the original film: that both Norma Shearer and Joan Crawford were woefully unattractive. The biggest problem with the Sex &amp; the City replacement characters (which, guess what, there are a core of four of) is that the golden girl of the original's cast, Sylvia, has been taken from the gloriously obnoxious character Rosalind Russell essayed, and turned into a fragile, weeping, less-promiscuous Sam from S&amp;tc, played by Annette Benning.The film proceeds in this vein, revolving completely about addiction to materialism and obsessive reliance on men, to the point that it almost becomes reverential, and even as a man, I started to get uncomfortable FOR women, who are being taught that pricks are Prada are the only things that women should desire, even if Bette Midler ambles in to tell Ryan to "be selfish" (and smoke a joint) during the wildlife retreat that was the original film's madcap centerpiece (which feels awkward in its placement, very remake-y, anyway). The entire film is about women having to make sacrifices and 'get over' any dalliances by the men, and completely falling apart without that companionship, and it paints the film into its corner during its exhausting hospital finale that ends up being apropos of nothing.It's hard to focus on the positives, or have a lot to say about it because it's so glaringly inferior to its namesake, but, like the Sex &amp; the City movie, the film does occasionally run into an entertaining sequence, or a worthwhile interaction, or even just a funny line. The cast, which is incredibly stacked, not only Ryan, Bening and Mendes, but Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett Smith, and small roles by not only Midler but Candice Berger, Carrie Fisher, Debi Mazer, and Cloris Leachman, who, as usual, has some stuff that is quite amusing, albeit in an underused capacity, and even with the troublesome subtext, it has several effective, "aww, you guys" hug-and-cry dramedy moments, and, being a full fifty minutes shorter than Sex &amp; the City, I'd say it earns about the same score.{Grade: 6.5/10 (B-/C+) / #25 (of 97) of 2008}</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Actually not bad, but the movie is a little hypocritical</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So I had the opportunity to see The Women, even though I'm not a huge fan of chick flicks, this did look a little interesting. I admit, I haven't seen the original, but I am a little curious, because from what I was seeing, this seemed like an ultra updated version that might have chopped up the original, maybe that's why there are so many harsh reviews. But just seeing this movie, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting, it's so rare we have the movies with an ALL WOMEN cast, I mean literally, no men, not even a man's voice is used in this movie, it's always put down by the guys because it's automatically going to be a "bad chick flick". But we do have a strong cast, although, I still have my doubts about Meg Ryan, not sure why she's still in movies, no offense to her, just I don't see her as a strong leading actress any more. But the story works and makes it a nice little watch for a group of friends looking for a movie.Mary seems to have it all, a rich husband, a daughter, and 3 loving friends who would do anything for her. But the bad news is her daughter and her do not get along at all, her daughter even asks for advice from her best friend, Sylvia. Then from a manicurist's mouth, she hears that her husband is cheating on her with the hot little number in perfumes, she tells her mother, her mom says to not tell her husband, make him grateful for her, the plan actually works. Mary goes home happy and relieved that her husband wants her back so badly, but then her friends tell her to get angry, she does and ends up separating with husband only to find out about herself before it's too late.The only thing I really didn't like about this film is that it has a slight message in the middle of it where it's saying how magazines are hypocritical of women today, that on the cover there's a hot young air brushed actress and on the inside it says to love yourself just the way you are, then we have 4 older but extremely attractive actresses who have in no right what so ever to complain about their looks. Meg Ryan doesn't look a day over 30, and I'm supposed to think yeah, I feel bad for her, it's understandable that her husband would see that she's slipping in the looks department, when it's the complete opposite. That's why I'm giving this movie a 5, it's enjoyable, but the message is just hypocritical. For a few chuckles, it's worth the watch, not a horrible movie, but I think I'm going to check out the original.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was fantastic, despite the bad reviews</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie probably 45 times. At one point, it held a permanent residency in my DVD player.First, the plot as described by IMDb is totally incorrect. Mary Haines didn't bond with any "society women" in the remake, unless you consider the pot-smoking modeling/acting agent played by Bett Middler a society woman! So that right off the bat is misleading and inaccurate.This is a story about a woman who, like many, has completely lost touch of who she is in the busyness of life as a mother and a wife who doesn't really work outside the home (she gets fired by her dad - it's apparent that it wasn't a real job to begin with). She's ambitious and driven, unlike her other married w/children friend who is perfectly happy at home with the kids running around everywhere.When she discovers that her husband is cheating on her with a Saks perfume spritzer, she goes on a quest to figure out who she is again. She discovers that she is unwilling to let it slide, as her society mother suggests. Finding herself at a crossroad, she decides to go down the path of starting her own business.I found this movie hilarious, touching, and strangely familiar. I could relate to every one of the characters, especially Sylvie - the busy magazine editor whose career is passing her by. Sylvie plays a huge role in this movie and her character fits in nicely. Not to mention, it's brilliantly played by Annette Betting.The other characters were just as important. And they were also well- acted. I personally felt that even minor roles, such as the one played by Jada Pinkett, was a fantastic addition. That character, along with the house manager and nanny, added much-needed comedic relief to a plot that is deceptively unfunny.I liked the movie beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An amazing cast of women, a compelling story, and some very clever lines, this is one to watch with your girlfriends. I've never seen a movie before that didn't contain one line of male dialog! That alone is worth the rental price. Cloris Leachman is fabulous as the housekeeper. Annette Benning is totally believable as the career climber. And I've never seen Meg Ryan in a role I didn't love. Spoiler: The scene where Debra Messing gives birth is both funny, raw, and more realistic than most. It's refreshing to see a film where all the women don't look absolutely perfect. Don't let the lousy reviews get in the way of seeing this film. Or your husband, for that matter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie about bickering friends...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>doesn't sound that interesting to me and guess what, it wasn't. Also, in order to enjoy this movie, you must get over the fact that it appears no men live in New York City. There isn't a single man in this movie. Even the scenes in stores and just walking down a crowded New York sidewalk feature all women. That's just a tad unrealistic.Any ways the film centers around Mary, whom finds out her husband is having an affair with a hot perfume girl. Her friends find out about it before her from manicurist, Tanya. I think Tanya was about the best character in the whole film, and all she does is gossip.The film stars a lot of older A list stars, whom you can tell have had more than there share of plastic surgery. Meg Ryan plays Mary, whom seems weak to me. She's just a spoiled rich New York housewife whom has neglected her husband and wonders why he's cheating. Just about all the characters are annoying. Especially, Edie with all her kids and she's having another one. And to end the film with her having the kid was so stero-typical. The writer couldn't come up with anything better.FINAL VERDICT: Housewives will probably like it since they can relate. A lot of people will think it has too many characters and it's not entertaining to see rich women complain about their lives.</fullReview>

I've never seen the original, but I'm surprised that if the original were this bad, they'd never do a remake of this film. One of the most novel approached I've seen in any movie lately was that this film had, absolutely, no men in front of the camera...not even a picture of a husband or a boyfriend. I've loved Meg Ryan since I first saw her on that soap opera years ago and I still love her today, but this film still leaves a lot to be desired.7 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

Yes I do know the original 1930s movie of "The Women" didn't have any men actors in it either, so they were just following that. It just didn't feel real without any male lead actors in it. It was like this boring women's soap opera.Okay this is a major spoiler, but I don't like how in the end she takes her husband back. In the original movie, she did the same thing. I also felt like the character Crystal Allen should have been given a bigger role, I wish she had done something that made her really hate you and that she was a real threat to their marriage.

		<shortDescription>An all-woman cast of stars in a classic remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Update: Saw the movie and the rating stays the same. What was so special about Leachman's performance? Go see the original instead. Well worth the effort to find it.I usually will give a movie 20 minutes before I walk out, but this time I barely made it to 5 so what I have to say is based on what little I did see, and then reading some reviews. First off, though, I want to make a point about remakes. When you "remake" a movie but change what the movie basically (mostly) is about, though you do leave in a few things (like some names), what you have is not a remake but actually a new movie (but with the same title). From this site's message boards, as well as others, I have concluded that this is what has occurred. We do not have a remake of the classic original from 1939 (because when you think about it someone would have to be not that smart to redo something already so great, which is why no one has redone Citizen Kane), but a totally different movie that just happens to have some of the same characters going through the same issues, which with movies now-a-days, happens often (unfortunately). Even those that had never seen the original find this movie offensive, so you have to wonder what is it about the movie that makes it so. And as much star power is in the 2008 version, even though we are not doing a side-by-side comparison, from what little I saw, and all that I have read, not one of the actresses, other than Leachman, was worth wasting your time on. Some of these women have some serious talent, so one has to wonder what happened. Bad script? Trying too hard to be somewhat like the original? And I know that Bening can do catty, as she did it so well in Being Julia. But some people liked this movie, and from what I can tell, it's mostly men who did. Interesting. This is one to watch at home and just sit back and see what happens. Maybe this time I won't walk out, but when I grow weary of it I can always pause and go do a few chores. Seems that happens more and more lately with what's coming out of "Hollywood."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The worst 10 things in this awful movie !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>10_It's unfunny.09_No men ? That made things boring, forced, and a bit strange especially while a scene like the one in which the 2 maids were repeating all the wife and husband's argument, let alone the endless one-side phone calls, the "he said to me.." lines. Overall it's a dull move that mirrors a complex the movie's she-makers suffer where men for them are "very obnoxious so let's make them invisible", or "we can succeed totally without them". Did you notice how it has no character of a positive man, albeit as a remote intimation ?! Even (Debra Messing)'s husband wasn't there for her delivery ! 08_An extremely monotonous pace. The director made nothing special.07_ Concedences. (Annette Bening) knew about the affair from the shop's girl by coincidence. Then (Meg Ryan) knew about the same affair from the same shop's girl also by coincidence. Then (Bening) and (Ryan) met the affair itself, (Eva Mendes), at another shop by coincidence as well. And that was done in just the first half hour ?! Well, I got the pattern, this movie has a coincidence every 10 minutes !06_ What's going on ? At first you think that this is a movie about 4 women. Then we have the main story of one of them. Then at the last 10 minutes we come back with them?? In any case, it couldn't be a comedy, or any enjoyable different movie about 4 women either! 05_(Candice Bergen) ??? What the hell she's doing here ?!!!04_(Jada Pinkett-Smith) as lesbian ? OK, that was only for winning extra bucks from the box office, more than anything. And her acting ?? It looked exactly like a lousy parody of her real life husband Will Smith. Terribly lousy !03_The long, very long, 3 screams of (Debra Messing) while the intolerable scene of giving birth. And they were stupid enough to put that in the trailer. What kind of a twisted mind that saw that as a good thing ?! This is drastically annoying and no fun. It deserves a Razzie award apart. God have mercy on the ones who had to watch it in the theaters! 02_(Meg Ryan) ?? OH MY GOD. She used to be a sweetheart?once. Now she looks unsightly and creepy. I thought this is an odd look-alike who has her same sweet spirit and cute reactions, or this is really her yet wearing a frightful mask that made her face as a nasty caricature! If they give me the choice to be a woman with wrinkles or to be The Women's (Ryan), I'll choose anything but the last. You can say that again about (Annette Bening). The thing isn't about the shock of the sight only, it's rather about features that stop acting anymore. I felt all the time as if I watch (Death Becomes Her 2), or a horrific documentary about the actresses above 40 in Hollywood ! It pushed me to keep thinking; that's more important issue to make a movie about than the one I'm watching, naming it "The Freaks" instead, with a tagline that says "Forget Dracula. Forget Frankenstein. Now we have Botox and Plastic Surgery. And they're BETTER", at least it would be an explicit Horror !01_The heroine comes back to her husband through a phone call ??? Anyone agrees to shoot that is an idiot !Now I have an opinion of a friend of mine. I always be aware of her viewpoints about movies, since she told me one time "Men in Black ?? This is so boring. I fell asleep in front of it after the first 5 minutes" (?????!!!!!!!!). She told me about The Women "what a great movie", so when I told her smiling "I didn't like it", she replayed so seriously disgusted "Men !". I believe she has 2 things in common with this movie's makers; they're the only creatures who actually love this movie, and they hate men ! It's a mix of soft colors and deformed women. Yet the worst part isn't its pedantry, it is its fact as a silly romantic tackiness, with nothing new except its ugly ? once lovely ? stars, and its viewpoint about what a great place the world is without men !. In brief, save (Eva Mendes) in that black underwear, this is awful. I can't think of anybody who may watch it again, even my crazy friend !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really liked this movie. I am usually a tough critic &amp; was surprised to see all the negative reviews for this film. I never saw the original. Perhaps this is why I wasn't holding the remake on a pedestal.Annette Bening is fantastic as usual and the rest of the cast does a great job. I appreciated the choice to only have females in the movie- it made it memorable. The only male in the movie is the baby born at the very end. If I'm not mistaken, even the soundtrack includes female artists. I loved "Money Can't Buy It" by Annie Lennox which was featured during Mary's fashion show.I think some women weren't pleased with the message this movie sent. I personally would not divorce a man if he cheated on me but made an effort to have me back. For those audiences who are hung up on this detail of the film, that's your loss. People give up on marriages too easily. If more women thought like the characters in this film, the female sex would have a lot more to be proud of. This movie was realistic and refreshing. I have seen it multiple times and never get sick of it.For women who want a good laugh and a fun time, I'd suggest this movie to any of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a review from a different perspective.I am probably the only one, if not one of the few, who will give a positive review for this movie. I went to see this movie with my girlfriend, expecting to see a chic flick. This is not my kind of movie but compromise is something that we all practice in any relationship. Besides, it has an all-star cast which may have somehow affected my decision to view it.'The Women' offers nothing extraordinarily novel except for the all-female cast. The first few acts elicited a laugh or two was all that was needed to sustain my interest to watch the entire film. The portrayal of the roles may not land Oscar nominations but was nonetheless credible.There has been much criticism between 'The Women' and 'Sex and the City'. It does not try to be 'The Sex and the City' and overall, I think this movie is better than Sex and the City. I have seen the latter months ago. 'The Women' offers a storyline that most first time viewers can relate to. What is true for Sex and the City fans may not be entirely true for other first time viewers.It has always been a challenge for movie adaptations of TV series, comics, and video games to introduce a succinct and intelligible plot and storyline to new audiences and this is where Sex and the City fails. 'The Women' was not all gold either; there were instances in the movie that could have benefited from a better delivery and punchline. The momentum was not sustained that could have concluded with a less predictable ending. While the Sex and the City caters to the world of high-rolling women engrossed with an overrated take on sex, and craze over fashion, and some notes on personal issues that are probably true for women of similar stature, 'The Women' offers a heart-warming comedy that centers on the power of self-determination, inspiration, and the value of family and friendship. After watching the two movies, Sex and the City is a film that targets the female demographic while this movie may interest both (or all) sexes.I am no film critic but an avid moviegoer. This is something that I can probably recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welllll ! I finally rented "The Women" and watched it Wed. evening. My reaction was positive, which surprised me. All the bad reviews, and the disappointment in comments about this version made me skip it in the theater, which I now regret. Always try to support the ladies films.I love the 1939 version and watch it often. Any remake would suffer in comparison. After all, it was written by one of the most brilliant women of the century - Claire Booth Luce. It had the top womens' director of the Golden Era of old Hollywood - George Cukor. The Queen Bee of MGM - Norma Shearer - was the star. Her studio rival - Joan Crawford - played her rival in the film. All the speaking parts were by top actresses, or starlets the studio was pushing toward stardom. In the greatest year for classic films, it was one of the best.Now, we have Meg Ryan as Mary, who is not bad, just not served well by the script. Annette Benning's character has been completely rewritten and while she does okay with it, I thought she was a bit strident at times. Debra Messing was the surprise - she was very funny as the always pregnant friend, and the final scenes were very funny to me.I also want to dish on the few trailers I saw for this film. They were horrible. They had nothing of the best of the film. The scene of Mary and her mother was not the best choice to bring women to the theater. A shot or 2 of the fashion show (I loved it); the lunch on the rooftop; or them all talking at once, would have been more true to the film. And! Why change the age of Mary's daughter from child, to teen? Do all films have to have a bored, dreary teen?All in all, better than expected. 7/10Jane</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not that bad.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie isn't as bad as people say. It was entertaining and had several good lines. One of my favorites was "This isn't some 30s movie". I laughed out loud about six times. This hardly ever happens to me at the movies. Also, some people on here have said some very cruel things about Meg's face lift. Don't they realize that she might actually read some of these comments? Meg, you are a beautiful woman! By the way, Candice made a reference to bad face lifts in the movie. Could this be an inside joke? The movie did a great job at showing the shallowness of the elite crowd and the birthing scene was one of the best things I have ever seen in the movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and say that I LIKED THIS FILM VERY MUCH!! For God sakes, remakes are not a mystery; the attitude of the producers is usually based on the myth that a modern audience would not warm up to the original (in this case, 69-year-old film), but they'd find time for a modern update. Overly simplified, but there you are. (I don't agree with that logic, but I AM over 40.) Anywho, I learned a long time ago the best way to view a film that is a remake or an update is to judge it on its own merit and put the brakes on comparisons. Just STOP thinking about the other films. Because Meg Ryan is Meg Ryan, not Norma Shearer. Eva Mendes is not Joan Crawford, Annette Bening is not Rosalind Russell, and so on. They are their own special creations, and bring their own brand of fire to the party. Oddly enough, it was the supporting cast that impressed me more than anything else. I liked the additions of Debra Messing and Jada Pinkett-Smith rounding out our quartet of heroines. They were the most interesting updates. In the original film, the mom with all the kids was a high society matron, but here Messing is 'Edie,' a bohemian artist with crazy hair, crazy clothes, a disheveled studio, and four girls, plus another baby on the way. But she wears the mom mantle beautifully, and is sort of the heartbeat of the film. And the writers seemed to have combined the characters of sassy actress Miriam and 'old maid' author Nancy into the new, feisty 'Alex' for Pinkett-Smith. She's a smokin' book author- and lesbian- who's not afraid to get to the point in short order. And acting legends Cloris Leachman and Candice Bergen round out the impressive cast as housekeeper and mother of the heroine very nicely. There's still the annoying daughter, the cat-fight between the dogs, and the 'jungle red' nail polish, but there's also smoother, more layered characterizations in all of the cast. Some have complained that the character of Sylvia was ruined because they made her 'nice,' but that's incredibly short-sighted. The fact that she's no longer a catty, unhappy harpy determined to make sure those around her are unhappy as well does not diminish her impact one bit. Writer-director Diane English pens a wonderful third-act conflict which focuses directly on Sylvia and her crumbling magazine empire. This way, all the women of our film's title are forced to look inside themselves for security and fulfillment. And after they find themselves, they turn to each other- much like a family. Definitely a nod to the sensibility of the 21st century.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A poor attempt at what could have been a great remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not usually one for nit picking the negative when it comes to remakes and films that have had a big publicity build up. Nevertheless, in the case of this film it would seem a Sex and the City rip off with a vague resemblance to a 1939 classic.As a fan of classic Hollywood films I found it a shock when I heard about this production and that I had not seen the original. I bought the original 1939 film on DVD and although it was very dated by today's standards I thought that there was a good basis for a remake and that the story could be successfully adapted to a modern setting.I therefore went to the cinema expecting an improvement on the film I had enjoyed some days beforehand. Needless to say I was disappointed. Only key scenes in the film resembled the original, such as the beauty salon and when Haines's friends set off to check out the 'Spritser Bitch'.Meg Ryan was an interesting choice for the role which I must say I found dull in the original. Norma Shearer's portrayal of Mary Haines's seemed very outdated making it difficult for me to connect with the character. The other female friends in this version were funny in places but I felt seemed to lack a realistic friend connection but appeared to be more individual, they were given their own persona's ? devoted mother, career woman and feminist lesbian.One of the key problems with this film is the character of Crystal Allen who in the original was played perfectly by Joan Crawford. I understand how it must be to take on a role played by such a legendary icon as Crawford but the choice of Eva Mendes is a poor one. I can see that the character is given more sex appeal which I feel is an improvement and I can understand how the filmmaker is aiming to bring this film away from the actors involved in the original and update it completely. Mendes does not bring the cool bitchiness to the role that Crawford did.The film does not really flow, Bette Midler's part is totally unnecessary to the film and the 10 on screen minutes that Haines's spends away from home at the treatment centre would appear confusing and pointless. We are given no sense of time at all. The ending is pure slapstick and odd, we do not see what becomes of Allen nor do we really come to any type of resolution.All in all the film is filled with plot holes and loose ends that at times confuse the audience. I walked out of the cinema only wishing that someone who was to take on this huge task had made a better job of it. It seems to me that the biggest problem was not the actors but the filmmakers who adapted the story in a poor way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie About Women By Women Really Spoke To Me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've read enough of the reviews here to see that few of these ladies appreciate The Women. They appear to miss the outrageous cattiness of the original, and craved the acting performances of old. Perhaps because I've not seen the original, I was more open. First of all, Meg Ryan looks fabulous! I simply don't get all the criticism of her appearance. I suspect there is some jealousy going on here. Eva Mendez is a knockout, and filled the bill quite aptly. SPOILER WARNING: If I were confronted by an "other woman" with her looks, I would have to kill her, AND him. Even the lovely Meg Ryan would find that daunting competition, and feel quite demoralized. I could feel her pain. In contrast to the fine performances of most of the cast, Bette Midler seemed out of place - almost "cartoonish" - and did not ring true as the other characters did, to me. However, even in real life, there are a few buffoons. I've known plenty of real women, and unfortunately a few catty ones, and I have no use whatsoever for their type. I appreciate that the manicurist is the only catty-type in this plot, and she is portrayed as a dim-wit. I cringed when I originally thought Sylvia was going to be the catty type, and in the original perhaps she was. In the 30's, women, and in fact most people were stereotyped on film. If you enjoy that, then there is plenty of it already in the can. I would have found something else to watch if that was what The Women was about.Mary Haines/Meg Ryan, like me, is a woman at a cross-roads in her life, dealing with endings, and not sure of how to start new beginnings. It is a frightening time, and we have to finish what we started, but plan for a new future. She needed to learn to be true to herself, and I totally get it. She also needed to get over the reality that the people in her life were going to fail and disappoint her. I have the same problem, and it is not easy to forgive much as you may want to do so. We women often fill so many roles, that we forget to even think about ourselves, and satisfy our own ambitions. If a little balance is not achieved, we can easily become a shell or automaton, and the joy of life is not truly experienced. It is what we real women deal with at some point in our lives. I am sure Joan Crawford was entertaining in the original, and someday when I am in the mood for something outrageous, stereotypical, and probably only good for mere amusement, I will sit back and enjoy. However, I have found that when you watch the remake first, the originals sometimes seem inferior, so I will not be too disappointed if the original falls flat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far More Enjoyable Than SATC</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, I'll start off right away by saying I'm a guy. I like good movies. I'm not one of those guys who won't go and see a "chick flick", because the thought of straight guys disliking the fact that a movie is about women and stars women is preposterous to me.There are better and more challenging movies out there to see right now, but "The Women" is certainly more enjoyable than the "Sex and The City: The Movie" no matter how you slice it. I liked spending time with these "broads" because they were actually interesting while the SATC girls were flimsy and flighty, and their movie was filled with stupid dialogue and a good 40 minutes that we could have done without.That "The Women" is scoring lower than SATC so far makes no sense to me, whatsoever. This is a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please don't waste your money on this, for the simple fact that you'll be encouraging the filmmakers to make more movies this bad. What a waste of great talent. It's been a long time since I've seen writing this bad; a 10-year-old could write a screenplay with more believable dialogue. It was also offensive on so many levels that I don't know where to begin. It makes me sad that women are portrayed as this movie portrays them--as shallow creatures only interested in shopping and clothes. Even the directing was pedestrian, and don't get me started on the sound quality. I've seen a lot of independent films, and even the most low-budget had better technical quality. Ugh, ugh, ugh.</fullReview>

If aliens saw this movie, they would report that there was no intelligent life on Earth.

		<fullReview>Just like "Burn After Reading," I wish the trailer would have given me a heads up about what the movie was really about rather than just trying to sell me to get me in the door. I was, of course, sold on the fact that there was such a great cast, and expected something a little different. Especially, after just coming out on the eve of the "Sex in the City" movie. Normally I would just say that this was a bad movie, but every woman in the audience who was in their 40's and 50's really seemed to be enjoying it. And that is what I got the sense of when I was watching this. I suspected that the writer/director was in her 50's (upon investigation that is true) and that if I was older I would probably "get it" and maybe enjoy it. It was almost painful for me, who is younger. It's like, they hit every mark of what "should" be in a movie about women. Like they were trying to hit every beat possible to try and seem liberal and attract all women. The part they missed, was, any woman under 40 who doesn't live in the midwest. Seriously, this script could have done so much more if they had just hired an early 30's writer to savvy it up a bit. Why not appeal to the Carrie Bradshaw crowd as well? If this film had been made 10 years ago, I think I really would have enjoyed it. But it really seemed like beliefs from a time a while ago, and a slightly older generation. Which, there is nothing wrong with that, but if you put a hot 30's/40's cast in it, I'm going to expect them to act and believe things that women their age would. I want to promote women's films, I just want them to be a little more smart about executing them. That being said, I'm sure my mom would enjoy this film, I'm just not sure that I would recommend it. Seriously, there are a lot of good 30's to 40's female writers in this town. I would say, implement their talents on your next film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whining, Self-Absorbed Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Women is a well intentioned remake gone wrong. The storyline remains similar to the original, with Mary Haines finding out her husband is cheating on her with a shop girl. The rest of the movie details how Mary copes with this knowledge and eventually tries to build a new life for herself with the help of her mother and friends, while trying to maintain a good relationship with her pre-teen daughter.There are multiple problems with this movie, the biggest one being that the characters are all incredibly bland. Mary Haines isn't a particularly well developed character and her problems are lame. Even without her husband, Mary is gorgeous, maintains her beautiful Connecticut mansion and finds the time to start an entire clothing line. Her supposed rival for her husband, Crystal Allen (Eva Mendes) is beautiful, but never seems to be a real threat, nor has much of a personality. Mary's friends are mostly one note as well. Sylvie is a completely self involved person who makes Mary's problems all about herself. Alex barely has a presence, and her distinguishing character traits are apparently that she is black and a lesbian. Edie is the free spirit who really enjoys having children. Little to nothing else is made known about her except for a "shocking" revelation at the end of the movie. It never is clear why Edie and Alex are even friends with Mary and Sylvie. None of them seem to have common interests, and each one seems designed mainly to appeal to a certain demographic. All in all, this is one to perhaps see once and then forget. The original is much better and less obsessed with brands and trying to send out a positive message to women, while falling flat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went into this movie planning on being disappointed. Honestly, the only reason I watched it was because I am (still) a fan of Ryan's (Yes, I'm the one). I had read the reviews, heard the negative comments, and felt prepared for a let-down. I couldn't have been more wrong to think that. This movie is good. It might even be great. The entire cast each carried their characters very well, which wasn't a surprise. We're talking about Annette Benning, Meg Ryan, and Debra Messing, here. Three great women, three great characters. Candice Bergen and Cloris Leachman even left an impression. Yes, I am aware that Jada Pinkett Smith and Eva Mendes also appeared in the film, but I didn't find them to have that strong of an impact, even though they did well with their respective parts. But that's not the point. The point of this review is to tell you to see this movie. You won't regret it. Don't expect it to change your life (it probably won't), but you can expect to laugh, and to feel for the characters, and you might even find yourself having a good time. Give this movie a real chance. You'll like it. And even if you do happen to find the story doesn't sit with you, you can rest assure that Benning's performance will.</fullReview>

I liked that comedy &amp; gave it the same rating as I am giving this. This version is was directed by Diane English from her screenplay, which in turn was based on the 1936 play by Claire Booth Loos &amp; film written by Anita Loos &amp; Jane Murfin.. The people in this version are about as well-to-do as in the original but not as insufferably snippy &amp; snotty. Here they are catty &amp; much more likable &amp; down-to-earth,Our cast is also an all star female cast (as in 1939) from film &amp; TV.Its stars Meg Ryan,Annette Benning &amp; Eve Mendes in the roles played by Norma Shearer,Rosiland Russell &amp; Joan Crawford. Also cast are Debra Messing,Jada Pinkett Smith, Bette Midler,Carrie fisher &amp; Cloris Leachman and Candace Bergen.The production is first rate filmed in various parts of the North East USA. There is a fashion show like in the original &amp; it pays tribute to the 1939 show very nicely,I did not particularly care for Debra Messing's last scenes, chalk that up to the fact I am a man nearly 81 yrs old.See this enjoyable comedy I am sure you will like it.

		<fullReview>personally i think movie makers are afraid everyone will forget the movies that were made in the past so they bring them back to the bring screen and change a lot of things. I think Hollywood should only remake a movie that got really bad reviews and has the potential to be something better. If we keep seeing all these remakes then the actors that starred in the original movies can't look back and say "that movie was the best movie i ever did and i was proud to be apart of it". Instead they're gonna look back and think "i'm so glad i got to star in the original" and "why did they have to remake such great classic". Anyway i thought this version of The Women was very funny. The best scene in the whole movie was when debbra messing's character gives birth.That scream she did was so funny.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Women" has received terrible reviews, possibly because it dares to attempt to recreate a beloved Hollywood classic from the Golden Age. I went to see it mostly out of curiosity. I had a good enough time. I did laugh, and I did cry. I probably won't ever watch it again, but it really wasn't the poke in the eye with a sharp stick that reviewers have been making it out to be.Annette Benning steals the film with a heartfelt, fully realized performance as an ambitious magazine editor. Meg Ryan is as cute as ever, and all the catty comments about age not being kind to her have been made by jealous people. Candice Bergen is not on screen long, but she is meltingly warm and lovely. Carrie Fisher was tragically uninteresting and almost unrecognizable in a cameo role. Time for an intervention? What I liked most about the movie was Diane English's script. It was really a script that was trying to do something, unlike most Hollywood scripts today. In spots, it was witty, intelligent, and worth listening for and to. There were misses, but more hits than misses.Yes, yes, yes, all the women are beautiful and rich, and not representational of all the women on the planet. Yes, they all wear spike heels and get manicures. Cry me a river. This isn't Bertolt Brecht's "Mother Courage," and if that is what you expected, more fool you."The Women" could have used better direction and, no, it isn't as good as the classic on which it was based. But it's a pleasant two hours at the cinema.</fullReview>

I believe she is one of the best actors around at the moment. The movie deserves praise simply because of her performance. I also think the writing is extremely good. And contrary to what many newspaper reviews say, there are some good lines in this movie, and more than a few laughs. The movie is well structured as well. The two hours run time flew by for me.

		<fullReview>Any way this film could have been done, it would have been tricky to update Clare Boothe Luce's play about a set of Republican society matrons from the late Thirties. I suppose that given the changing mores it was done the best way it could be. Probably had a period picture been done of The Women it would have really unfairly compared all the contemporary actresses to Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, and Rosalind Russell.Stepping into the parts those screen legends played are Meg Ryan, Eva Mendes and Annette Bening. Ryan is the same loving wife and mother who makes the mistake of taking husband for granted and he becomes pray for Mendes. Proving every bit the mantrap that Crawford is Eva Mendes. That part of the story is still the same, the shop girl interloper among the society dames.But these women have grown with the times. They've even got a lesbian friend in the person of Jada Pinkett Smith. If there were lesbians back in the day and I'm sure Clare Boothe Luce knew a few from the theater, it was something not discussed in polite society. One of their watering holes in this version of The Women is a lesbian bar and they all seem quite comfortable there. I'm betting also they're not registered Republicans even the Upper East Side Silk Stocking variety.Who would ever dream that Bette Midler would be cast in a role that Mary Boland originated. But I liked Ms. M a whole lot in the part of the free wheeling countess who befriends Ryan at the health spa. She's a theatrical agent nicknamed 'the Countess' whereas Boland was a countess via one of her many ex-husbands. Still they both are victim to L'Amour, but Bette is more brutally frank about it.The biggest change is the part of Sylvia Fowler the gossipy fish wife that Ryan has for a friend. Annette Bening even with the part rewritten to accommodate a kinder and gentler Sylvia, can no way match Rosalind Russell in the film that made her a comedy star. With all deference to Ms. Bening, Rosalind Russell is a favorite of mine among the leading ladies of the classic cinema, I'm prejudiced where she's concerned.I wasn't also crazy about the matter of fact way The Women deal with Mendes, she doesn't quite get the come uppance Crawford gets in the original.Still this version of The Women has nothing to apologize for. In fact it's curious that Clare Boothe Luce has for years been held up as the conservative's model for feminism. Within her circle she probably was, but I don't think she'd like this version of her classic.Which is a good reason to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I tried to like this movie. I really, really did, because I love Annette Bening and Meg Ryan. I'm sorry to have to dis this film, but this is 2008 and you can't make a film with an all female cast, about women, for women, by women and expect it to be interesting and engaging. There just needs to be some testosterone in there somewhere.I saw this last night with my wife and she kept apologizing to me throughout the movie for suggesting we see it. BTW, I was the ONLY guy in the theater. She owes me BIG time.There are several problems here. First of all, poor script. It tried to be funny, but missed the mark with me. Maybe it's because I'm a guy, but I didn't hear my wife laughing all that much either. We both have great senses of humor too. Second, somebody better pay the makeup person better. I've never seen Annette Bening, Meg Ryan or Cloris Leachman look so.....worn and ragged...and old. Call me old fashioned, but I like to see people look better on screen than off. I suspect the director wanted to portray women as "real" looking. They're real alright - real OLD looking! My third problem was with the age difference between Meg Ryan and Annette Bening. They're supposed to be best friends in the movie, but I swear, Annette Bening looked like Meg's mother which was very distracting.Finally, by opting to have no male actors here, all the cool interplay there could have been between the sexes was eliminated. There was no contrast for the actors to latch onto. It soon became...boring.I love good "chic flicks". Steel Magnolia's is one of my faves. But this movie is poorly done. See it at your own risk. If you're a guy, I feel for you man. You may need some therapy afterwards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lame story and acting. It really should have been called "Postmenopausal Women". If this was a comedy I must have missed something. It was more of a drama because I could cry thinking about how much I spent on this garbage. If it wasn't for the caffeine in my soda I would have fallen asleep. Movies like this give "Chick Flicks" a bad name even for females like me. Beginning? Middle? End? Not in this one. This is nothing to write home about. It's not even worth a video rental. The lighting was horrible. The actors' faces were washed out making them look like walking dead. It's possible it was done on purpose to keep a bunch of old ladies from looking their age while they were playing in a juvenile story. I like Meg Ryan, but I'm getting tired of her sad sack movies where we all have to feel sorry for her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starving for Sex n the city? The Women tries to satisfy your craving</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many other reviewers have written that The Women is a poor remake of the 1930s Ms. English. This is true, but let us not overlook the fact that the foundation of the story may be of Ms. English, but the motive for this movie was to imitate Sex and the City. The film was released with pristine timing. Shortly after Sex and The City sucked in millions but not too far in advance so that girls will forget about it. Even the trivial title of the film, The Women, screams that the filmmakers had no intentions of creating a reputable film, but a commercial piece for those starving for more Sex and the City. By titling the film, The Women, it's an obvious attempt to beat you over the head about who this film is made for, in case the five women on the poster didn't do that for you already (speaking of which, the marketing dept didn't miss a beat by identifying every possible ethnicity and age group in the movie poster). This film had no intentions of being good, and I feel that way because I give the actresses, at least the actresses, more credit than this. The intention was simply to get people in the movie theater and get their money out of their wallets and into the cash register. Once that was done, how people felt about the movie was a moot point. Also, important to note, that there are absolutely no men in this film!!! Not that you need men to make a movie or a good movie. That's not what I'm saying. But this film went so far out of its way to be about the women that men completely avoid the set! I don't even recall seeing an extra as a male! Overall, this is the epitome of Hollywood garbage; I film created not to tell a worth-while story but to attack a market, a certain demographic that will surely bite the bait is all the essential elements are included: High end nail salons, plastic surgery, Saks 5th Avenue, lesbians, liberated women, women disputing over men and friendship and mainly, selfishness. I urge to not support this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining &amp; FUN!! We loved it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Never a dull moment &amp; lessons to be learned thru this movie! As a mother, Candice Bergman gave excellent advice many of us could use. If your a female w/ close friends who are good-fun like mines, watch it w/ your girls! Or even alone. We were all able to relate to the characters, situations &amp; parenting issues in the movie, maybe that's what made it emotional yet so hilarious. Everyone wanted to borrow our friend's rented DVD to watch it again so I went out &amp; bought my own knowing it was the kind of movie I could watch over &amp; over, especially when down &amp; out. It's all in good fun while it lasts, seriously, and you won't be disappointed in comparison to all the other cra* rentals out. I didn't even know this was a remake till I read another post but I think I'd rather look at Eva than Joan Crawford. I don't think Joan Crawford could make me laugh period. I think of Mommie Dearest every time someone mentions her name. The script was well written &amp; the main characters all played their parts w/ good humor well. It was also exhilarating to see most my favorite great actresses in a single movie! I even got misty eyed when Annette's character remorsefully confessed she betrayed her friend (Meg) b/c her job was at stake. I was kind of disappointed that Jada looked so thin. Natasha Alam wasn't convincing at all as Jada's gay love interest or a fashion model, which is what she is. Bad acting complicates role-playing for other actors making it a challenge for them to be convincing, but Jada's professionalism out shined Natasha's flawed acting &amp; carried us over to the next scene. It was a bumpy ride but she managed &amp; it was smooth sailing after that! Her character was me to the tee, I can't stand being out in the day or I have to keep my shades on, lol. Although it was Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) 1st fashion show, they could have did better w/ the clothing. The first set of dresses were so plain &amp; so tight around the model's breast that it was unrealistic anyone would allow them to walk out like that. Worst yet, caught a store like Sak's attention. She made her point tho, and that was that we can't take care of others until we learn how to take care of our own needs first. The more we give our children &amp; husband to love &amp; respect, the more love &amp; respect they'll have for us! Great ending!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Breathtakingly Captures the Female of This Generation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like "Mama Mia" (2008) captured the musical presentation of contemporary family life, "Women" (2008) captures the comedy-drama of contemporary female life. Both on the surface and underneath, this delightful, funny movie presents most of the female characteristics, the fine nuances of many fascinating female personas without pretense, without dramatic flair. The performances are actually more sensitive with dazzling undertones, hues, feelings that really hit home, the pulse, the frantic energy, the intellectual interplay. This fusion and immersion of many well-known actresses of our age is one of the highlights of the year for female movies, perhaps in many years. The ending also lifts the notion of male and female relational movies a definite notch...making this movie standout. Nine out of Ten Stars.</fullReview>

Annette Bening plays a business women who still has time for her best friends. And Jada Pinkett Smith plays a lesbian night owl who won't trade anything for her friendIf you have a mother, a daughter, a grandma, an aunt, a best friend, or any woman in your life; so see this movie with them. This is one of those movies where you walk out feeling different about yourself and the world around you. Chick flick doesn't begin to describe The Women.

		<fullReview>I haven't see the 1939 version of this film and, after seeing this remake (which I enjoyed very much), I am definitely encouraged to see that earlier version. It is a little strange to see a whole film in which there is not a single male actor. I guess the whole point is to show - in a somewhat self mocking way since this is a comedy - the relative importance (or otherwise) that women often put on the opinions and/or advice of other women. I found the humour to be quite subtle (rather than 'laugh out loud'), which is the kind of humour I generally prefer. I liked the pairing of Meg Ryan and Annette Benning. All the many characters came across as 'likeable' individuals. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

In order to like themselves they must reject trivialization by others of who and what they are. A grown woman should not have to masquerade as a girl in order to remain in the land of the living." Germaine Greer Wild Hogs, Because I Said So, and Devil Wears Prada?now why do I link those films with the new chick-flick, The Women? They're not all losers like Women, but each illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of the current unlaughable comedy.To start: The Women is a failed comedy about mostly women of a certain age or approaching it struggling either to save their marriages, keep their high-profile jobs, or deal with new girlfriends. All very modern but flat because writer and first-time director Diane English gives her ladies mediocre lines (approached with an offer of a face lift, fashion editor Sylvie Fowler (Annette Bening) retorts, "It's my face; deal with it").In updating the original 1939 film with screwball queen Rosalind Russell, English may have bled the wit right out of the script. But I still love women in general.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Women was a very good movie for women to see. If you liked Sex And The City then this is a perfect movie for you. Meg Ryan was fun and charming at the same time. Then she did show how to be a good and bad mother. The movie kind of has a weird direction. It seems hard to find out the direction for the film but after a little while it was good. The messages were good and there were many. Jada Pinkett Smith was very funny and should have had more screen time. She really glowed in this movie. It is a very enjoyable movie. I was surprised on how good it was coming from a teenage guy. The movie didn't really ever have a kick start it was pretty much just mellow the whole movie. The story was average but very cliché. It wasn't a bad story though. I think it just could've had more to it. In ways they should have told more about the other girls stories. Overall though not a bad movie at all. Go see it if you are a women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great fun, Great New lines... Must See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film to a packed house in Fort Lauderdale on Friday, and the audience (as well as I) really enjoyed the film. There were many fans of the original '39 film and you could hear comments when there were obvious references to original lines and scenes.As a HUGE FAN of the original, I did enjoy this movie a lot. i didn't expect it to be anything like the original... it's another time.. HELLO! The only way it could be like the original is if it was scripted in 1939. Diane English has written a wonderful new script, and the actresses performed beautifully.MEG: Good choice as Mary. Some lines I thought were out of character for her, but you be the judge.ANNETTE: Great performance, as usual. One of my favorite actresses, good casting by English.JADA: Nice to see that the Nancy character can be an out Lesbian. The references to Nancy's sexuality in the original were subtle, but obvious for those in the know.DEBRA: Excellent acting, and hysterical lines by Debra. I always enjoy her comedy, and I can't help comparing her to Lucille Ball in talent sometimes.EVA: What can I say? She played the character she was supposed to be... a wife stealing snake. She was perfect. She's sexy, resourceful, and not unlike some of the women here in South Florida :) .BETTE: Too small a part, but excellent performance as always. CANDICE: Loved her as Mary's mom. Again, Candice's delivery is unmatched for certain lines, and her long working relationship with English helps her shine.CLORIS: I am so happy to see her cast in this movie. A forgotten talent that should be in a lot more movies. Her versatility is incredible, but in comedy, she's an American treasure.DEBI: Of all the performances, I was disappointed in her role as Tanya the manicurist, aka Olga from the 1939 original. Not sure how to describe it other than it was like she was reading her lines. I LUV her in almost everything, so was shocked as well. What gives??Overall, great film, true to the original concept of the lives of women in high profile jobs/marriages, and their interaction together. Updated well, and the ending was heartwarming. Some great new lines; as funny as the original script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A terrific comedy-drama about the powers of friendship. Despite it's a remake of a 1939 film of the same title, it would probably be compared to Sex And The City. I would not compare to it totally. The story starts with Mary(Meg Ryan) who seems to the life most women would envy, she's happily married, has a good daughter, great friends, and a great home. But Marys perfect life isn't what it seems, when she discovers her husband is cheating on her with Crystal(Eve Mendes) from Zach's. Mary is puzzled and doesn't know what to do. But her four good friends, Sylvia(Annette Bening), Edie(Debra Messing), and Alex(Jada Pickett Smith) try to be there for her in anyway they can. I really don't want to give anymore away. But I found this enjoyable, and I'm a man. Meg Ryan is great, it is nice to see her in on the screen again, after a series of flops. And the rest of the cast are also great including Eve Mendes as Crystal. Just an enjoyable lighthearted comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I will freely admit that I haven't seen the original movie, but I've read the play, so I've some background with the "original." If you shuck off the fact that this is a remake of an old classic, this movie is smart, witty, fresh, and hilarious. Yes, the casting decisions may seem strange, but they WORK. I'm a staunch feminist, and I wasn't offended in the slightest by this movie--despite what other women might be saying. This is NOT a movie for men to see (so please, ladies, don't drag your guys to see it with you, that's just cruel); women will get the jokes, the situations, and the relationships. I was pleasantly surprised by the depth that Annette Bening brought to her character...she did an excellent job. Debra Messing was adorable, and Candice Bergen was fantastic. I was less impressed by Meg Ryan...she brought emotion to the table, but her comedic take on it was less strong. The all-female cast is strong, and it definitely a laugh-out-loud sort of comedy. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and fully intend to go see it again with my mother. Women will understand.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the disaster I heard it was</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mary Haines (Meg Ryan) a rich woman discovers her husband is cheating on her with a younger woman (Eva Mendes). She doesn't know what to do and friends Sylvia Fowler (Annette Bening), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing) and Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett Smith) try to help.OK--there was no reason to redo the 1939 movie. That's a true classic and doesn't need to be updated and redone. Naturally it WAS done. This has gotten some of the worst reviews I've ever seen for a motion picture. I love the original and have seen it MANY times--I was constantly comparing it to that. Now this isn't a classic but it's not that bad.**MINOR SPOILERS!!!** First the bad--the story is old and was (badly) updated. Really--a man cheating on his wife is hardly shocking today. Meg Ryan (a wonderful actress) is pretty terrible here. Her face seems unable to change expression! I couldn't believe how bad some of her scenes came over. Eva Mendes is bad too--but it's not entirely her fault. Her role is badly written and she has to compete with Joan Crawford from the original. Smith's character (a tough lesbian) goes to pieces in an operating room. It IS funny...but it's showing that a strong woman instantly goes to pieces when confronting an emergency. Also the script inserts some clumsy passages where Ryan talks to her daughter about being yourself. In those moments it seems more like a Lifetime movie than anything else.Now the good--this movie retains the originals' decision to NEVER show a man on screen. This movie is about and for women--men aren't needed (BTW--I'm a man). Bening is just great as Fowler--whenever she's on screen the movie makes a great leap. Also Smith is just wonderful--she doesn't overplay (or underplay) her lesbian character too much. Messing is good too but she's not in this much. Bette Midler is just hysterical in a small role and Cloris Leachman pulls off the nothing role of a housekeeper. The direction is good too--especially during a fashion show sequence. I heard director Diane English purportedly had a lot of trouble directing her first full-length movie but it doesn't show in the final product. Also there are some clever references to the original (mostly certain lines) that were inserted with no fuss.I saw this in an audience full of women (there were a few guys but not many) and they loved it. The movie ends on an operating room sequence that had everybody howling. So--this wasn't needed but it's not the disaster people are saying it is. Also--people are saying we don't need a movie with all women. Well--why not? I see plenty of movies with all guys in the cast and no one complains about that! Ignore the complaints and bad reviews and see this. With a better performance by Ryan I might have given this an 8 or 9 but, as it is, I can only give it a 7.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, this film is another remake. Yes, this film can be considered a chick-flick. And yes, this film is not perfect. The Women is however a clever modern update on the social behaviors of all women, with an impressive cast of A-listers including Meg Ryan, Debra Messing, Annette Benning and Bette Midler.The film revolves around four main characters, Mary (Ryan), her best friend, editor-in-chief, Sylvie (Benning), Alex (Jada Pinkett-Smith) and Edie (Debra Messing) and the out-of-this-world female creature who is responsible for most of the film's drama,named Crystal (Eva Mendez). Mary is trying to deal with her cheating husband (who's never actually seen in the film), by following the advice of both her friends and her mother (Candice Bergen).Aside from Mary, there's Sylvie who's torn between her social life and her professional life. She has decisions to make that test her moral and ethic values. Then there's writer Alex who's a lesbian, with a lot of spunk, but knows her way with words. And finally Edie with four girls and another baby on the way, who loves children and has a heart of gold, with a hidden secret revealed at the end.Together the women live for revenge, rely on each other, and give each other life lessons. But it's the cameos by Bette Midler, Candice Bergen, Cloris Leachman, Carrie Fisher, and Debi Mazar, that show the cruel and usual behavior of women. Bergen plays Ryan's mother, she's tough, silver-tongued, experienced, and yet feels she could have become what her daughter does later. There's Fisher who shows how to blackmail and test the boundaries of selfishness, morals, and betrayal. Mazar, the gossip girl, that shows no mercy for what she says and whom she says it to. Leachman who plays Ryan's sassy housekeeper, she knows her place, when and where she's needed, and how to deliver a good one-liner. Finally there's MIdler, who plays Leah Miller, a crazy eclectic but wise Hollywood agent. She's the one character who gives Ryan's Mary an epiphany on who she truly is by discovering "what do I want." Despite Midler's scene stealing performance and memorable quotes, she was underused.But back to the film, together the women show the audience what it means to live in the 21st century without knowing exactly what you want until the time comes when you answer that very own question. It tackles feminism, what it means to be a woman (fierce, ruthless, bad-ass, tacky, smart, sly, clever, shy, proud, ashame, self-conscious, careless, beautiful, strong, independent); and also what it is that women want, why are women the way they are. It's funny, modern and by all means not a masterpiece. But the Bottom line is, it's worth the money and time to see veteran and younger actresses teach us all about women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like Sex &amp; the City, but Slightly Older</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Women is a cute movie about women at all ages (but mostly 30+) and their issues in life. Not just men and infidelity, but also about relationships with friends &amp; family, making time to connect with others, problems with image, compromising your values, accomplishments in life, and finding what will really make you happy.It's also about being true to yourself. A lot of times, people will give you advice but not really follow it themselves. Sometimes they have created a delusion for themselves, and should you really follow in that same path or react based on your feelings now? I really liked this movie. Granted, it was trying a bit to be like Sex &amp; the City at times, but that probably helped me like it. The difference here is it's kind of like the discoveries after the stage in life that the Sex &amp; the City stars were in -- here, most are married or past the point of trying to find a man. Now, they are trying to find happiness in their marriages and lives.Obviously it's not an Oscar contender, but it is entertaining and serves its purpose.And for the men out there, there were an equal share of men and women in the movie theater (most were with their wives/girlfriends), and the men were in fact laughing. :)</fullReview>

Annette Benning looked different to me in every scene she was in. Candice Bergen is showing her age as is Carrie Fisher. The daughter, Molly, was exceptionally acted by young India.I was able to understand the dialog which is tough in many current films due to rapid speech. Cloris Leachman and the woman from Finland were terrific as the housekeepers who extend their regular duties. The NYC scenes were nice to see. Oh, and Bette Midler had a short role but as usual was terrific. So I gave this chick flick a 9. Guys- Go see this even just for the eye candy like Eva Mendes. It won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>BRILLIANT movie, funny...watch with your girlies!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was funny from START to FINISH. Everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud throughout the film!! The best characters were Alex Fisher (Jada Pinkett), Edie Cohen (Debra Messing, the girl from Will and Grace) and Tanya the manicurist (Debi Mazar). They had the best lines, the best attitudes etc. Jada Pinkett playing a lesbian was really funny, she really played it well and was very convincing. The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters weren't as funny even though the movie focused around them........ All in all, this is a great movie to go and see with your girls (yes guys, it's a girlie movie through and through!). Enjoy!!!</fullReview>
