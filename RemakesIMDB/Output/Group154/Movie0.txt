		<shortDescription>Good, well made Western, traditional and enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beset by production difficulties and largely ignored by critics upon release, this is a film that, like its star, has grown better with age. Director Hathaway's open-air style perfectly suits the expansive nature of the material, which by today's standards seems almost leisurely. In fact Sergio Leone acknowledged this fact when he greatly reworked the opening station scene as the beginning of Once Upon a Time in The West/C'era una volta il West (1969). (He also had his heroine arriving at his own Clearwater station later.) Elmer Bernstein's score is a standout, recalling his achievement on The Magnificent Seven (1960). There are several scenes which gain immeasurably from his masculine music, which ranges from the grand celebratory mode of the main theme to some suitably subdued and menacing cues for the final showdown.A convalescent Wayne plays the returning gunfighter John Elder, summoned by the death of his mother. Bewigged, paunchy, and slightly wheezy, the recently de-lunged actor still acts an imposing head of the Elder clan. He finds himself leading a dysfunctional family, united at first by grief, then the clumsy depredations of Morgan Hastings (an excellent James Gregory) who has swindled his way into possessing the family land. Together with memories of the late Katie Elder herself, like an American monument, Wayne's presence dominates the film. Recognising this, Hathaway uses it to great advantage with the first view of his star, perhaps Wayne's most impressive screen entrance since that in Stagecoach of 26 years earlier. As Katie is buried, in long shot, we take in an overview of the cemetery with its cluster of mourners, A massive rock formation overshadows the land. After a few seconds, a small detail catches the eye high up in a cleft. The camera cuts closer, and we think we recognise the figure. Cut again, and it is shown to be the watching John, irresistibly solid and still. At this stage in his career Wayne so easily assumes the permanence and grandeur of landscape that the iconic nature of this moment is accepted by the viewer without question.This is last time in his career that Wayne is so emphasised. Twice in Katie Elder the director takes the opportunity to film his star 'doing the walk' ? his tall frame strolling purposefully towards the camera, intent on action. In later films (such as Hathaway's own True Grit (1969)) such virile ruggedness is replaced by hard-bitten cantankerousness, more in keeping with the actor's advancing age. It was more the rule too, in Wayne's later career, for seriousness to be replaced by knockabout humour, reaching a zenith in the boisterous McClintock! (1963). In Katie Elder, many of the interior scenes between the brothers are marked by such elements of genial horse play, culminating in a fist fight in which John Elder crashes through a door. Outside they present more of a unified force, optimistically dubbed by Hastings 'the Elder Gang'. Showing this is more difficult than it seems, and fortunately Hathaway keeps matters under control. Moments of broad comedy, like Tom (Dean Martin) auctioning off his glass eye, are not too distracting and often provide a contrast to more serious moments (Curley threatening Matt with gunplay). The banter between the Elder sons also serves to unify the siblings in the most natural way, and establish relationships, even if some of the camaraderie is hard won. In particular one wishes that the two older brothers had more to say to each other, or shared some scenes alone - especially given the on-screen rapport Martin effortlessly created a few years earlier when he worked with Wayne in Rio Bravo (1959).As the villain of the piece, Hastings has an emphasised affinity with a special firearm. His armament enthusiasm recalls some of the baroque arsenals appearing in some spaghetti Westerns of the time, where the traditional six shooter was replaced by ever more fancy weapons. At the start of the film Hastings has already hired Curley, a heavy dressed all in black in very traditional fashion. This range thug is played well by George Kennedy, and the scene where he is clubbed in the mouth by Wayne is often cited by viewers as one of the most memorable. In fact, so effective is Curley's suggested brutality that one wishes more could have been made of a man who says ominously 'I don't care what I have to do, as long as I get my money'. Curley and Wayne needed more of a showdown to make their moral antipathy pay dividends, and the viewer is disappointed that this doesn't eventually occur. It is one of the weakness of the film that the villain meets his demise so casually, a victim of crossfire rather than a deliberate showdown. As Hasting's son Dave, Dennis Hopper performs adequately. One feels he would have been better cast as the younger Elder brother, with more to do. In contrast to Kate's oft-stated warmth towards her absent sons, Hasting's treatment of his sibling is cold and uncaring. If the less experienced face of Jeremy Slate had been cast as his son, the gun lover's cruelty would have been even more damning. As it is, Hastings' attitude towards Dave is left largely unexplained, although predictable enough.Apart from the casting and music, much of the pleasure of the film springs from the mise-en-scene familiar to those who enjoy the big 50's and 60's Westerns. The geography of Clearwater for instance, so effortlessly established in the early scenes; the interior of Katie's pioneer cabin, or the gunfight by the river. It is also a reminder of a lost time in Westerns, when an ever reliable Wayne confronted frontier trouble, with none of the moral complications suggested by the contemporary work of a Peckinpah or Leone. Like the simple pleasures Mrs Elder found in her beloved rocking chair, this is a production which has been continually revisited by fans since the initial release, and will continue to be so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting Katie A Monument</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Feisty Katie Elder has passed on and her sons have arrived in Clearwater, Texas for her funeral. Katie's four sons are played by John Wayne, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson, Jr. and three's a certain amount of hostility directed towards them from some quarters. And a bit of fear evident in the town's people. It also turns out that their father had been murdered a few months before that and their ranch now belonged to James Gregory. When questions are asked, trouble starts.One thing is clear though, none of her kids has quite turned out the way she hoped, but the three oldest are going to see that young Anderson becomes some kind of success in life. Despite some glaring plot weaknesses The Sons of Katie Elder is a film that is sold by the sincere playing of its leads. I'm not quite sure why the Elder boys didn't come back with the news of their father's death and settled things back then. Or why Michael Anderson was so resistant to some higher education.This was a special film for John Wayne, the first post cancer operation film he made. And he did it and all his subsequent films with essentially one lung. One thing about Duke was that he really loved MAKING movies. I've always thought on some level he wanted them to make money because that way he could make more of them. Wayne just loved being out on location, working all day and partying all night, this was him. Although his health gradually deteriorated and he became more testy and irritable and he had more and more need of an oxygen tank as years past, he wouldn't give it up until he HAD to. For John Wayne it really was a labor of love.Wayne surrounded himself with a good cast of familiar players for the most part. This was his second film with Dean Martin who after completing this film started on his highly acclaimed variety show. And his guest on his first show, John Wayne to plug the upcoming release of their film. They are an interesting pair of older Elder brothers. Wayne who lives by a strict code and Martin who gets by on his wits and a larcenous streak. Still the affection the two had for each other in real life comes forth on the screen.Dino has a real moment to shine when he sneaks out and brings Dennis Hopper back to the stable where Wayne and a wounded Anderson are holed up. One of his best acted scenes from any of his films.George Kennedy plays a menacing gunman that James Gregory hires and he also gets quite a clout from John Wayne with a two by four after Kennedy was bullying John Doucette. It's a great cinematic moment from a Wayne film, but afterwards you can't find any trace of injury on Kennedy for the rest of the film. I remember in Joe Kidd when Clint Eastwood gave Don Stroud a similar clout, Mr. Stroud looked every bit the injured party for the rest of that film.Though we never see Katie Elder we get quite the picture of the uncomplaining pioneer mother through the townspeople that knew her and their sons. I'm still also not sure though why Earl Holliman was supposed to be such a bad role model, he's a hardware merchant in another town. Still the other three Elder boys want Anderson to aim higher than that.Elmer Bernstein's musical score is one of the best that is featured in a John Wayne film. Wayne films were always distinguished by good use of music, something the Duke learned from John Ford. Bernstein and the Duke first worked together in The Comancheros and this one is every bit as good as that rousing score.The action sequences are the best part of the film and the last half hour with the ambush on the bridge by Gregory's men right up to the explosive climatic battle with Wayne and Gregory, the excitement doesn't let up for a New York minute. No western fan should miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good traditional Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw this movie some 30 years after my first viewing of the film--and surprisingly I found it to be a lot more entertaining than my first recollections of the film.It's a traditional Hollywood western: good wins over evil, the hero gets the girl, and law is maintained. It has no complications. Even the Mexicans are shown squatting at the funeral far apart from the others only getting up to bury the body. That was how most Westerns were made...So what's good about the film? Elmer Bernstein's music is as good as his music in 'The Magnificent Seven', if not better. The range of actors: a believable John Wayne, an entertaining Dean Martin with "third-eye" act, a menacing George Kennedy, a "likable" Strother Martin in a brief role as the winner of the third eye, and a fine performance by young Dennis Hopper makes the film above average viewing.The real hero of the movie is "Katie Elder" dead when the film begins, respected as the film unfolds, and never seen on screen. Everyone seems to remember her with awe. She is epitomized by the empty rocking chair (final shot) and a Bible she leaves behind.Henry Hathaway's westerns will not be reflective ones as are later Westerns such as "Will Penny", "Tell Them Willie Boy is Here" or "Monte Walsh"--his movies tend to affirm the status quo of typical Hollywood westerns with a heart (good Christian values, strong connection with nature and animals--horses in this movie--as he did in "How the West was Won") and no mind (insensitive to Mexicans and Red Indians). The Christian values in the film are fuzzy, e.g., fool some poor gullible guys at a bar and emerge a hero, or sell a blind horse to gain money and remembered for it at your funeral, etc. This film of Hathaway, ably supported by Bernstein's music and Lucien Ballard's camera, is a great movie for an audience that wants to see a traditional western unfold--and but not be asked to think beyond what is shown.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another winner from the Duke.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first scene I think of when I think of this film is the sight of John Wayne belting George Kennedy in the mouth with a 2 by four.It hurts my jaw just to look at it,or even think about it.He deserved it,by the way,as John Wayne once again takes on the bad guys,this time with the help of three brothers,played by Dean Martin,Earl Holliman,and Michael Anderson,Jr.They are not perfect,themselves,mind you,but they feel they, as well as their late parents,were done wrong and set out to make things right again.As for Katie Elder,we never get to meet her,as the film begins with her funeral,but we are told so much about her,that by the end of the film we have painted a pretty vivid picture of her in our minds.This movie is very adventurous,as most Duke films are,sad at times and even takes the time to be comical in places.The film also makes me sad for the Duke personally,because,as some of you may know,that on a break from filming this movie,Duke discovered he was sick with cancer for the first time.This movie is indeed a must have for any John Wayne fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Wayne Oater!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sons of Katie Elder", though not one of John Wayne's best westerns, is very entertaining nonetheless. Director Henry Hathaway keeps the story moving providing us with breathtaking scenery and a rousing finale. We are also treated to another rousing score from composer Elmer Bernstien.The story has the four Elder brothers, John (Wayne), Tom (Dean Martin), Matt (Earl Holliman) and Bud (Michael Anderson Jr.) returning home to Clearwater, Texas for their mother's funeral (the "Katie" of the title). It seems that Katie had been held in reverence by the townspeople while eking out a living to enable the youngest, Bud to attend college.Their father had also died six months earlier and had apparently lost the family ranch in a poker game. Further investigation reveals that he had been murdered by being shot in the back.Number one suspect is the town gunsmith Morgan Hastings (James Gregory). Hastings it seems, has acquired the Elder ranch and lives there with his spineless son Dave (Dennis Hopper). Hastings has also hired gunfighter Curley (George Kennedy) to help him get rid of the Elders.When town sheriff Billy Watson (Paul Fix) is murdered Deputy Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate) immediately blames the Elders and arrests them. While transporting his prisoners to another venue they are ambushed and.......This was the first film for Wayne following his surgery for cancer. You'll notice that he wears a large bandanna over his neck, presumably to hide the scars and/or the jowls. He was now beginning to show his age and the fact that at nearing age 60, he was still playing a character presumably much younger, kind of detracts a little from his credibility in the role. But hey its John Wayne. Who really cared?As in most of Wayne's films, the cast includes a roster of recognizable faces. Martha Hyer provides window dressing as Wayne's potential love interest. Also in the cast are John Qualen as the jailer, John Litel as the minister, John Doucette as the undertaker, James Westerfield as the banker, Karl Swenson as the bartender, Rhys Williams as Striker the horse rancher, Strother Martin as the guy who "wins" Martin's glass eye, Percy Helton as the storekeeper and Rudolfo Acosta and Chuck Roberson as contends.The two plus hour running time goes by quickly. Don't miss the scene where Wayne cold cocks Kennedy or the final shootout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Learning to late of their mother's love...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne as the weathered, weary gunslinger determined to give his mother a better legacy; Dean Martin as the lovable, harmless con artist; Earl Holliman as the wild west version of the middle child; Michael Anderson, Jr. as the baby whose full of p**s, vinegar and gunfighter worship and tired of living by everyone's rules. Watching these four "express their opinions" is enough to make anyone want front row seats to the next reunion.James Gregory as Hastings, the new man determined to have the town in his pocket; Dennis Hopper as his son; George Kennedy as the hired gun who really, really enjoys his work. Martha Hyer as the mother's friend who's tired of the violence. All wonderfully written characters and fleshed out believably.While I do agree that this movie has a varied pace that drags at times and the music is distractingly close to "The Magnificent Seven" I still see the story of four sons who never realized the value of their own mother until her death.The opening scene at the railroad depot sets the underlying tension and up until the cattle drive, all the supporting characters are walking on eggshells. Whether the townsfolk refuse to speak of the father's death or they berate the sons for their treatment of, or lack of, their mother, the sons receive no breaks throughout the film.Regardless of the music, the direction and writing are at times both sufficient and excellent. With the town's protection of the deceased mother and scornfull arguments to the sons, as well as the relationships of the brothers themselves, this entire story is fleshed out no better than our own actual lives. Since when do brothers need an excuse to wrestle? Also, who would you rather spend ten years away from if not your family? All told, the movie and story reflects the family dynamic and its affect on its surrounding, how the family extends to include neighbors as well. Basically, I'm glad I bought it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sons of Katie Elder (1965)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(8/10) Without a doubt one of Duke's most underrated Westerns. The fact that the four main stars are so unbelievable as brothers is shadowed by the acting and charm that each character brings to the screen. Dean Martin follows up his Rio Bravo performance with another gem cementing his place as one of the supporting stars working alongside Wayne. George Kennedy makes an intriguing antagonist but was underused. Wayne's romance with Martha Hyer and was pointless and a waste of time; the film should have devoted the attention to better build up the relationship among the brothers. The film tends to drag on towards this is a fun movie even non- western fans can enjoy. Excellent score.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well this film is perhaps not in Waynes top 20 it remains very watchable and can be veiwed on many occassions.Katie Elder had 4 sons it is asking a lot to accept the age range but it works well.Dean Martin gives a good performance as Tom and Duke is John the other brothers play their parts well but are dwarfed by the two stars.Hathways direction is tight and tho a bit on the slow side you can't switch off once watching.Filmed justt after Waynes lung had been removed you can see its importance in his career,the action scenes took a lot out of him but being the man he was he got them done with help from an oxygen mask,and many of the crew were impressed by his professionalism and bravery.A box office succes,it kept Wayne in the publics mind.So not quite a classic but worth watching for the two stars and the bravery of John Wayne no one else has ever filled the screen like the Duke.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Traditional and Routine Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The writers borrowed heavily from a few earlier Westerns that had been success, especially "Rio Bravo," but the results look like the imitations that they are.John Wayne is the eldest of four brothers of the recently deceased Katy Elder, who died alone and in poverty, darning socks and doing laundry to put one of her sons through school. The others haven't been around for years. Wayne is a hired gunfighter, Dean Martin a card shark, Earl Holliman a hardware store owner, and Michael Anderson is a kid away at college. The four sons return for Katy's funeral.In brief, they discover that Ma had been cheated out of her land by Hastings, James Gregory, and his gang, which includes the hired cut throat played by George Kennedy.To get them out of his hair, Hastings frames the Elders for the murder of the decent Sheriff, Paul Fix. It takes the rest of the film for the sons to clear themselves and reveal the machinations of Hastings.It's strictly routine. It's packed with fights and shoot outs, but there's nothing to distinguish it from dozens of other movies with less expensive stars and lower production values. It might have provided a plot for one of Wayne's Westerns from the 1930s.There's one amusing scene, built around a fist fight between the brothers. The dialog has lines like, "I don't like it . . . too quiet out there." Martha Hyers has a role. She was a beauty queen from Texas and a staggering burden to any film she appeared in. Wayne was getting to be too old for these kinds of part but he walks through it in a soldierly manner. Dean Martin was a good counterpart to Wayne in "Rio Bravo," so he's back again. Earl Holliman was a journeyman actor whose appeal has continued to elude me since I first saw him on screen.Now, that's all pretty bad stuff that I've just written, I know, and there are probably many people who will enjoy this as a reassuringly familiar movie with good guys and bad guys, with actors in roles that fit them comfortably because they've played them so many times before. And it is, after all, John Wayne here -- his heft, his bulk, his very John Wayneness making up for some of the deficiency in the character. When Wayne was willing to challenge his screen persona, he could do a fine job. Seven or so years after this mediocre entry in the Wayne ouevre, the same director, Henry Hathaway, would guide him through a far more challenging part in "True Grit." However, "The Sons of Katy Elder" was one of a string of Wayne Westerns in which his stereotyped character appeared with few variations. He kept marketing the same John Wayne for years in forgettable efforts like "The Train Robbers." One can't help wishing he'd had more confidence in himself and his public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A largely mediocre western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite all the talent involved this is, for the most part, a largely mediocre western, albeit a very handsome one, (any film photographed by Lucien Ballard you could guarantee would be handsome). There is one marvellous sequence involving an ambush on a bridge but otherwise the plot is flimsy and the classic elements we expect of a good western are mostly absent.This time round, instead of one hero we have four, the Elder Brothers, representing some serious miscasting between the youngest, Michael Anderson Jr, and the oldest, John Wayne. The others are Dean Martin, giving the film's best performance, and Earl Holliman, underused as ever. They've returned for the funeral of their mother, the titular Katie Elder, (but not the Katie Elder of legend), only to find their pa has been murdered and their ranch purloined by villain James Gregory. There isn't anything new in the picture and it's bereft of action until past the midway point. It's reasonably entertaining in an undemanding kind of way but from Hathaway you expect better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four brothers led by the Duke banded together and seek vendetta against nasty killers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After their mother's death , four brothers are reunited . John Wayne is a gunslinger , Earl Holliman is an easy and silent young , Michael Anderson Jr. is a college graduate and Dean Martin is a drunk gambler. When they aware that her mother's death might have been killing , they come together to devise a a way to seek vengeance in the murderer , James Gregory , who hires an ominous gunfighter , George Kennedy , along with bullies and hoodlums . As the ranch owner Katie Elder's four sons determine to avenge the murder of their father and the swindling of their mother .But the marshal, Paul Fix, tells them to lay off .This cultured actioner Western contains a wonderful friendship between brothers , thrills , dashingly violent action , rider pursuits , impressive attacks and loads of crossfire . In ¨The sons of Katie Elder" Hathaway does the human touch including lots of nice moments , it is a very fine picture that could become another western worthy of any anthology . This John Wayne movie is well in the tradition of classics as ¨The Magnificent seven¨, ¨Garden of evil¨ or ¨The searchers¨ . One of the Duke's most popular film of the 60s ,-in his first character following cancer surgery- as well as ¨¨The Alamo¨, ¨Rio Bravo¨, ¨El Dorado¨and ¨McLintock¨. In the film "The sons of Katie Elder" the spectator enjoys because it has a lot of issues that make it agreeable . Even the female character played by attractive Marta Hyer, reveals a woman who knows that she wishes and makes it irresistible . Large support cast formed by Western usual players as Paul Fix , James Gregory, Earl Holliman and special mention to big Dean Martin . Breathtaking and lively musical score by Elmer Berstein , one of the best of Western genre along with ¨The Magnificent Seven¨ and ¨Comancheros¨ soundtracks. Colorful and spectacular cinematography in Cinemascope and Techniclor by Lucien Ballard.This well-paced in cracking style flick is stunningly directed by Henry Hathaway and usually works very well . He does the human touch and full of insight that accompanied him during most of his films and the story develops pleasantly in a large frame with an interesting plot and fully adjusted to the requirements of the action .The motion picture is professionally directed by Henry Hathaway with strong screen presence by John Wayne , both of whom collaborated in various Westerns , they included ¨Five Card Stud¨ , ¨North to Alaska¨ and Wayne's Academy Award-winning ¨True grit¨. Hathaway himself was only even nominated for an Oscar , but his movies themselves are testimony to his skills to heighten narrative tension and shoot action so exhilarating it made adrenalin run . Henry was a craftsman who had a long career from the 30s with successful films , and especially Westerns , as ¨Brigham Young¨ and ¨Raw Hide¨ . In his 60s Hathaway still got the vigour to make some fiery movies as ¨From Hell to Texas¨, ¨How the West was won¨, ¨Nevada Smith¨, and ¨Shoot out¨ . He was an expert on Western genre as he proved in ¨True grit , Five card stud , Nevada Smith ,How the West was won , Rawhide , Brigham Young , Buffalo Stampede, Garden of evil¨ and of course ¨The sons of Katie Elder¨. Rating : nice Western that will appeal to John Wayne fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last great Wayne films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Other than El Dorado and The Shootist, this is probably the last great John Wayne film. Apart from these, he made a long string of pretty forgettable films late in his career. They aren't so much bad, but they have nothing new to add and seem to be more "by-the-numbers" films than anything else.The only reason I don't score it higher is because of ridiculous casting. The 4 sons of Katie are probably close to 40 years apart by age--plus, the 4 look NOTHING like each other. I think Woody Strode would have been almost as convincing as one of John Wayne's brothers as the 3 they chose.So what was so worth watching? Well, the acting is great. Wayne and Martin is a good pairing and the plot of sons seeking revenge is quite compelling. Although not exactly "high brow", I also like the scene between Wayne and the blacksmith--now THAT'S the way to get some answers when the guy doesn't want to talk!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Very nice movie, typical of the many entertaining, solid Westerns John Wayne made in the 1960's i.e. McCLintock, Chisum, El DoradoHere's what I liked:- Wayne and Martin make a very good team. Nice to see them together again after "Rio Bravo".- I usually don't pay much attention to musical scores, but this one stood out as very good.- Good story. The characters were all believable (with certain exceptions listed below) and I cared about everybody at the end.- Nice supporting cast. Martin is excellent. I always like Earl Holliman. Paul Fix is solid. Very nice work by George Kennedy as the henchman. James Gregory is appropriately slimy and devious as the heavy. Interesting appearance by Dennis Hopper as his sniveling son. Even a short bit by my fave Strother Martin.- This was a typical "town" Western. Town Westerns are usually very restricted in their use of dramatic Western scenery and landscapes. "Shane" solved this problem by placing the town right at the foot of the Grand Tetons. I liked the way this movie used a couple of subplots to get out into the country for some scenes. i.e. the Elders' horse drive and their later prisoner transfer to Laredo.- The plot was pretty clever regarding the timing and place of Paul Fix's murder and the Elder's trip to Pecos to pick up the horses.Here's what dragged the movie down:- Wayne's just way too old for his role. He was 57 when he made this, but was coming off of a major lung operation, making him look much older. It appears Katie Elder gave birth to her youngest son at age 50 or older!! - It's especially ridiculous for him to have a romantic interest. I believe this may have been his last quasi romantic lead role before moving on to more appropriate parts as a father and grandfather.- The basic plot is confusing. Bass Elder was murdered six months before Katie died, yet the sons only returned for Katie's funeral? The script waxes romantic about Katie almost endlessly. Perhaps the boys didn't care for their father? Then why do they risk their lives to avenge his death?- The actress who played the female romantic interest was horrible and her part was gratuitous and creepy, given her flirtation with a man almost old enough to be her grandfather.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A noble western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't agree with opinions who don't see the depth of this movie. I think it's an noble western with wonderful heroes. Every single character which is represented by the four sons is able to sum up the whole evolution of Hollywood westerns. But every single hero is broken by Texas because Texas is the destiny that stole their dreams and at the end their souls. Every existence that is shown is terribly failing. OK, this is a very pessimistic but also realistic view on the "birth of a nation". There is the gun hero John Wayne, the gambler Dean Martin, Earl Holliman as the failed burgeois scrap-dealer and the demotivated collage-kid. I like the creation of suspense as a rocking chair with the precision of a sharp shooter rifle. Another wonderful aspest of this film are the great playing supporting actors. Everybody is inspired by the young dennis hopper, the middle-aged george kennedy and the impressive dean martin. But John Wayne remains to be the king of unwritten rules of this genre. At the end the showdown causes the incarnation of dramatic, tragic, the frontier-conflict between savageness and civilization with a rousing happy-end. So, it's a b-movie of highest quality and finest gun-power. Rio bravo light maybe...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Magnificent Four!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John, Tom, Matt and Bud, these are the Elder boys, who upon meeting up at the funeral of their recently deceased mother, find that their father may have been murdered over a card game. The boys must cast off sibling rivalries and find out just what has been happening in their childhood town of Clearwater, Texas.Unfairly given harsh treatment upon its release by the critics and beset with behind the scenes problems, The Sons Of Katie Elder actually holds up rather well in this day and age. All the required traits are in the film to make it an oater of some worth, a splendid cast with as much macho beef as you can shake a stick at, a top Elmer Bernstein score, the wonderful use of the Casa Blanca location and a revenge driven plot of some note. So why is it hard to actually sell this picture to the staunch Western crowd? Well coming as it did in 1965 it certainly has something of a modern sheen to it, an uneasy bed fellow with the wild west theme of the picture. The casting of the brothers just about works, but Michael Anderson Jr (Bud) and Earl Holliman (Matt) do seem to be overawed by the presence of John Wayne (John) and Dean Martin (Tom), meaning as a foursome it never quite gets to being a tight acting unit. The length of the picture may also be an issue to some? Long periods of inaction work to me personally because the characters (family unit) are gaining much needed depth, but for those wanting guns a toting at frequent intervals are not exactly catered for.Yet what action there is surely more than makes it worth the viewers patience? From the Duke swinging a nice piece of hickory to a wonderful riverside shootout, Henry Hathaway's Western is not found wanting for memorable sequences, in fact if you ask me then the mere sight of the Duke blasting away with a six shooter in each hand is a truly blood pumping joy, and don't get me started on a delightful Dean Martin scene as he raffles his glass eye! So all in all it's not without its itches, but as 60s Westerns go, The Sons Of Katie Elder is a hugely enjoyable picture to enjoy by the fireside on a Sunday afternoon. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Brothers Become A Family</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four brothers reunite in Clearwater, Texas to attend the funeral of their mother--Katie Elder. None of them has been very attentive to her needs, but their neglect has not been intentional. They are all wanderers. When they return to Clearwater, they discover how little they know of Katie's recent circumstances.John Elder (John Wayne) is a renowned gunfighter and the father figure to his younger brothers. Tom (Dean Martin) is an inveterate gambler who likes to manipulate the odds. Earl Holliman plays Matt, next to youngest. And Michael Anderson, Jr. is Bud, the youngest--a reluctant student who is always ready to prove his mettle.As the sons visit local merchants and the town bank, hoping to settle Katie's accounts, they find that the townspeople knew her better than they did. One woman, Mary Gordon (Martha Hyer), plays the good neighbor while they are in town, just as she had promised Katie.Two mysteries arise: Why had Katie moved from the family homestead? And who had killed their father? In the first part of the film, the men investigate, unable to let go. The rest of the film is a series of actions sequences.John Wayne plays his usual cowboy self--forceful and determined. Earl Holliman is solid as Matt. Martin and Anderson are less natural in their portrayals. Martha Hyer plays Mary in a wonderfully understated fashion. The remainder of the cast includes a delightful collection of character actors who add color and are fun to recognize.The musical score feels forced and reminiscent of other, larger films. When the insistent strains of the orchestra back up a scene on horseback where the action is sedate, it feels inappropriate. I blame the director, not composer Elmer Bernstein.I really enjoyed the way the story develops in the first half of the film--with subtlety and sophistication. The second half is your standard shoot 'em up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The four Elder boys return to Clearwater, Texas for their beloved mother Katie's funeral after some time. The eldest John (John Wayne) is an infamous gunslinger. Tom (Dean Martin) is a gambler. Matt (Earl Holliman) had an unsuccessful hardware store. The youngest Bud (Michael Anderson, Jr.) was sent away to school after he was accused of stealing a horse. Their father had sold the family ranch to new land baron Morgan Hastings (James Gregory) under mysterious circumstances. The bank insists that Katie had no money despite selling the land. Hastings hired gun thug Curley (George Kennedy) just in case. Sheriff Billy Wilson tells the boys that Hastings says their father gambled the money away and then got shot in the back, all in the same night.Bud Elder is terribly annoying and the young actor is doing very broad acting. This is all very old-fashion. For any old western fans, this is a perfectly fine watch. It also has a younger Dennis Hopper as well as big names like John Wayne and Dean Martin. The story is pretty interesting with some compelling villains. It's not one of the great westerns but it is a well made traditional one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Now who do you think was the stinkin', dirty low down rat that killed our Pa?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though I enjoyed the picture well enough, I kept getting sidetracked by events in the story that managed to distract. The main one had to do with the ages of the Elder Brothers, particularly John (John Wayne). The family Bible had a notation that Katie Elder married in 1850, so even if she were pregnant with her oldest son at the time, and John Wayne looking every bit of his fifty seven years, the story would have taken place around 1907!That certainly wouldn't have been the case, so let's say John Elder was in his forties. A reference was made by youngest son Bud (Michael Anderson Jr.) about the Dalton Gang, saying he wanted to ride with brother John and become famous just like them. John's response was intended to give Bud pause, stating that the Dalton's were hung. But that wasn't correct either - Grath and Bob Dalton were killed during an attempted bank holdup in Coffeyville, Kansas in 1892 (another hint about when this story took place). Emmett Dalton was captured and sentenced to life in prison, though he was pardoned after fifteen years in 1907 (about the time John Wayne's character would have been fifty seven). So again, some simple math works against the picture if one wants to get technical.Be that as it may, there's something to be said about the basic premise of the picture. The recently departed Katie Elder must have been a saint of a woman as every resident of Clearwater, Texas held her in the highest regard. On the flip side, three of her four sons wound up on the questionable side of the law, and Bud was headed that way if his siblings didn't send him back to college. But first, things have to be set right regarding the death of Bass Elder and the loss of the Elder ranch to Morgan Hastings (James Gregory).What one might not expect in a film like this is the number of scenes written for humorous effect. The argument the brothers had about the Katie Monument was pretty comical, and Dean Martin's glass eye raffle was a hoot. It seemed only appropriate that Strother Martin would be the winner.Probably the film's biggest missed opportunity came when gunman Curley (George Kennedy) was killed in the ambush at the bridge. His character was introduced as the antidote to gunfighter John Elder's presence in Clearwater, hired by Morgan Hastings in case the brothers got too close to the truth about their father's death and the ranch's new ownership. So the expected showdown that was suggested never became a reality. On top of that, Curley wasn't curly, and if I had to guess, a screen writer who saw this movie might have been inspired to give the same name to the Jack Palance character in "City Slickers".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but flawed, western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A good, but flawed, western. Had the makings of a great movie: a family relationship story and a mystery, all set against a Wild West backdrop. The relationship story had its moments, especially when learning of all that the mother had done for her sons, but was never concluded. As soon as the action started, that side of the story disappeared.The mystery side had more legs, but the suspense is not sustained and the cat gets let out of the bag far too early.With both the relationship-drama and the mystery-drama drama disappearing, it becomes a cowboy movie. Not a bad one, but not a great one either. Some plot holes and contrivances. This may seem sacrilegious: but John Wayne is miscast in his role. He is too old and too out of shape for the part. The part needed an actor in his late-40s at most (well, who at least looked mid- 40s...). John Wayne was 58 at the time and looked it.Dean Martin brings his showbiz charisma to his character and it works well. Good support from Earl Holliman, Michael Anderson Jr, Martha Hyer, James Gregory and George Kennedy. Good work from Dennis Hopper in one of his first cinematic roles. The hyper-active, constantly-nervous character seemed made for him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Wasters And A Funeral</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was Rio Bravo Meets The Magnificent Seven, not as good but even more sprawling and undisciplined. John Wayne was the hero again, but now sans one lung and finding good films gradually harder to come by?as was everybody if only they'd known it. He churned this type film out by the dozen every year in the '30's, this long and lazy oater would have made three Lone Star's.The four useless sons of the late Mrs Elder return to her funeral, try to reform to help get their youngest brother an eddication but trouble dogs their every hoofbeat. There's some dark secret being kept from them and baddie James Gregory is probably at the bottom of it all; when the secret is revealed you have your work cut out wondering what exactly the secret was. I liked the melodrama, the OTT acting of the leads, the matter-of-fact corniness of the loose plot. I liked an ethical doctor for treating the youngest brother for a gunshot wound without even caring whether or not he was a smoker. I liked the limping possible romance that is allowed to peter out and flatline. In fact, it's a pleasant time-filler, nothing terrible and definitely nothing great. The great gunfight on the bridge was a little savage for my taste ? except the classic moment when the deputy sheriff hilariously got shot dead in mid-air, and I don't think anyone knew the correct moral outcome for shot-in-the-back brother Dean Martin as he was on his own admission a rather callous murderer. Ah well, even if it's all rather pointless the biggest justification for the movie is that folks got jobs and some money must have been made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four brothers reunite at their mother's funeral. They discover their mother was broke and their father had been murdered six months before and try to figure out who is responsible. This was John Wayne's comeback film after his much-publicized cancer surgery that cost him a lung. It also reunited him with Rio Bravo co-star Dean Martin, who plays one of his brothers. The other two are played by Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson, Jr., who replaced Disney star Tommy Kirk at the last minute. Much is made about the age gap between Wayne and his brothers, particularly Anderson. It seems obvious to me that the character Wayne plays is supposed to be younger than he actually was at the time. Maybe even as much as ten years younger. It's not a big deal unless you're the type of person who lets little things get to them. This is a fun western with a solid cast. The bad guys include James Gregory, George Kennedy, and Dennis Hopper. Not one of my favorite Duke movies but a pretty good one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sons of Katie Elder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four sons join together to get revenge for the murder of their drunk, habitual gambler father on the wake of the death of their beloved frontier mother, Katie Elder (never seen, but her presence is felt throughout the film anyway; how her memory always returns establishes her importance in the plot). John Wayne, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman (The Forbidden Planet), and Michael Anderson Jr. are the Elder sons who return to their mother's funeral, finding a town who wants no part of them. Wayne, as John Elder, is a known gunfighter while Martin's Tom has a warrant out for his arrest after an incident with a bartender in another town. The Elders are set up for the murder of Clearwater, Texas sheriff, Billy Wilson (Paul Fix, veteran of television), by a conniving, sneaky, no-good gun store owner, Morgan Hastings (character actor James Gregory, a veteran of television, particularly Barney Miller). Hastings is the one responsible for the murder of patriarch Bass Elder, resulting in the loss of land which left Katie without her home. The Elder sons attempt to right the wrongs orchestrated by Hastings.I admit that "The Sons of Katie Elder" isn't one of my favorite John Wayne westerns, certainly, in regards to his pairing with Dean Martin, not a patch to "Rio Bravo". That said, I found it entertaining for what it was: a story about four men trying to do right by their maw after a life of muddying the name Elder, especially John who is known for the bloodshed as a reputed gunfighter. Katie, a pacifist, loved John, but hated violence, and this provides motivation to try and do something (forcing youngster Bud (Anderson Jr.) to return to school and do Katie's memory justice) that would make her proud.Katie had a plan to raise cattle, so the Elders attempt to ride them to miners in the Rockies, but this plan is interrupted by Billy's "replacement", the green deputy Ben (Jeremy Slate) who believes they were behind the sheriff's murder, even though this is hogwash considering the Elders were in Pecos receiving the cattle. George Kennedy has a memorable part as Gregory's hired gun, black hat and rattlesnake grin, who will help Hastings in his plan to snuff out the Elders as they are carried, bound in chains, by stagecoach across a bridge. This film also has an early role for Dennis Hopper as Hastings' nervy, sniveling son, Dave. Curiously, the film is absent a lot of action, except two sequences at the end, including a bridge blown apart by dynamite and a gun store exploded, with more emphasis on the Elders attempting to put aside their criminal pasts to restore their family name and allow Katie to have died with some dignity. The film does have a playful brawl between the brothers which erupts when an angered Bud (mad as hell that John didn't draw in a gunfight with Kennedy's Curly in a bar) provokes John inside Katie's old home. I will say that the gunfight at the end, where the Elders must fend off Hastings' men underneath the bridge, is quite thrilling, although, interesting enough, this normally results in the conclusion of the film, but is instead a precursor to the return to town so that John can have one final showdown with Hastings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 60's Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great old-time western with a wonderfully-rousing Bernstein score. I have a further continuity error to add which hasn't been listed by IMDb... When the boys first return to the house in which their mother died the painted backdrop behind the fly-screen door shows a wagon wheel in the background. After the first cut-away from John Wayne's character the backdrop is different, with no wagon wheel. Following the second cut-away, the wagon wheel returns. If you rent or buy the DVD (as I did) you can slow motion this section of the film and you'll see the continuity gaffe clear as day. Nit-picking, I know, but you'd think that this would have been picked-up in post-production.Anyway, regardless of the errors...this is a fine example of a typical "John Wayne" western...good story, well told with fine acting and a great musical score. For fans and students of Wayne's acting style this film offers a special moment. When John Wayne's character is walking towards the bank to settle his dead mother's affairs there is a particularly long shot of Wayne walking towards camera. The shot displays John Wayne's forward-shouldered gait that was a trademark of his western characters. If you like westerns you'll like this film...most enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The theme of this movie focuses on four sons' separate lives brought together by the death of their mother, determined to do what's right now, even though maybe in the past they failed her, each one in one way or another. Their determination to do what's right takes place in the face of the townspeople's scorn, accusations of wrongdoing and danger. They begin by setting about to ''settle up'' their mother's estate and step-by-step learn that something fishy took place when their mother was forced off their 1,200-acre ranch. Their determination to do what's right even in the face of an exuberant deputy, a lynch mob and other circumstances proves their ''steel.'' It is a classic western theme, somewhat like High Noon. One can see how their lives may be permanently changed by the actions they take and the events portrayed in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Even With Only One Lung, The Duke Succeeds</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot can be said about what John Wayne was becoming in the 1960s: old-fashioned; rampant, unquestioning patriot; militant right-winger, etc., etc. But there was something else that he still was: a Hollywood presence like few others before, and even fewer since. He was also undergoing a stark change in his life, one that can be seen to some extent in the film he made early in 1965 with old friend Henry Hathaway (NORTH TO ALASKA) in the director's seat?namely THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER.Wayne, Dean Martin (reuniting with The Duke from RIO BRAVO), and relative greenhorns Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson Jr. are four brothers who have returned to their former hometown of Clearwater, Texas to pay their respects to their mother Katie Elder, only to find that their family's ranch has been bought off under mighty peculiar circumstances, namely (and supposedly) a card game that their father lost, and was shot and killed for. The four brothers' reputations as overgrown juvenile reprobates (even Wayne), however, precede them; nobody's talking, not even the local sheriff (Paul Fix, of "Rifleman" and TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD fame); and Fix's deputy (Jeremy Slate) has a lot against them. Then the four have it out with the man (James Gregory, who had played the manipulated politician in THE MANCHURIAN CANDIDATE) who bought their family's ranch out in that suspicious way that he has, along with a beefy gunslinger (George Kennedy), and Gregory's vicious but none-too-sharp kid (Dennis Hopper).What was notable about KATIE ELDER was that it was the first film Wayne had done after having had one of his lungs removed (in late 1964) because of all the smoking and boozing he had done throughout his life. This required him to carry an oxygen tank with him on the set; and he had to use it a lot since he not only did a fair amount of his own stunts, but also because much of KATIE ELDER was filmed in the rarefied high-altitude air of Durango, Mexico. It didn't seem to affect his performance adversely, though; he was still doing his particular thing, being The Duke as he would be for practically every Western he did from this point forward (even in his Oscar-winning role as Rooster Cogburn in TRUE GRIT in 1969). He also was so taken with the scenery in Durango (and the cheap Mexican labor there) that a lot of the Westerns he made between this one and 1973's THE TRAIN ROBBERRS would be made in that locale.Even with Wayne's stoic presence here, he doesn't overshadow his co-stars too much. Martin, looking fairly sober, does his turn as the card-shark brother; and Gregory, Kennedy, and Hopper make for a trio of nasty villains. There is also the reassuring presence of Strother Martin in one of his many character roles; the great cinematography of Lucien Ballard; and a rousing score by Elmer Bernstein, with the title song done by the legendary Man In Black himself, Johnny Cash.While both the film and its Big Star may seem quite dated in a lot of ways, as an old-fashioned, traditional Western opus, THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER delivers the goods in ways that you would expect any John Wayne film, especially one directed by Hathaway, to do. No one will mistake it for the more radical films that would soon alter the Western (THE WILD BUNCH; ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST; BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID); but for what it is and what it intends to do, one could do far, far worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne's Comeback Film After His First Bout with Cancer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious gunslinger John Elder (John Wayne of "Rio Bravo") returns to his dusty hometown of Clearwater, Texas, to pay his final respects to his deceased mother in Henry Hathaway's first-rate western "The Sons of Katie Elder," co-starring Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, James Gregory, George Kennedy, and Michael Anderson, Jr. "The Sons of Katie Elder" ranks one of John Wayne's finest western melodramas that he appeared in during the 1960s, and veteran director Henry Hathaway of "Garden of Evil" delivers more excitement, suspense, and tension than most westerns can muster. The scenic Mexican scenery that substitutes for nineteenth century Texas looks is appropriately rough-hewn. Several scenes stand out in "The Sons of Katie Elder." Among them are the noisy gun battle at a creek crossing, a barroom raffle for a glass eye, the hero's fight with a thug at a mortuary, and the violent finale in town. Originally, "Magnificent Seven" director John Sturges had been scheduled to helm this lively sagebrusher, but doctors diagnosed Wayne with lung cancer, and the box office baron had to postpone the film so that one of his lungs could be removed. Anybody that craves a good, tough, old-fashioned western will love "The Sons of Katie Elder." Director John Singleton's urban remake of this John Wayne &amp; Dean Martin classic that came out in 2005 starring Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson?"Four Brothers"?lacks the energy, charisma, and celebrity star power of the original..Since John Elder doesn't want to create trouble, he surveys his mother's funeral from afar while his younger brothers, gambler Tom (Dean Martin of "5 Card Stud"), entrepreneur Matt (Earl Holliman of "Sharkey's Machine") and Bud (Michael Anderson of "Logan's Run"), attend it at the cemetery with several members of the community that knew and loved Katie. Later, at the grave site, Elder learns from Sheriff Billy Wilson (Paul Fix of "The Rifleman") that Katie lost her ranch to the most influential citizen in town, not long after his father, Bass Elder, died under mysterious circumstances. It seems that Bass Elder gambled the ranch away to Morgan Hastings and then got shot in the back. Billy informs the incredulous Elder that Katie was living in the Lupin place on the other side of town when she died from being worn down to a frazzle. Billy is concerned that Elder, whose reputation with a six-gun precedes him, will stir up trouble. Anyway, John rides over to the ranch to reacquaint himself with his siblings. The Elders decide to clear any debts that their mother left behind and see if she had any money in the bank from the sale of the ranch. They are surprised to learn from the town banker, Mr. Vennar (James Westerfield of "Dead Aim") that Katie died flat broke and that Vennar let her live on the ranch.Meanwhile, unscrupulous entrepreneur Morgan Hastings (James Gregory of "PT-109") hires a burly gunman, Curley (George Kennedy of "Cool Hand Luke"), to keep tabs on the Elders. Hastings suspects that the Elders may pose a danger to him for his acquisition of their ranch. Curley doesn't cotton to the idea of tangling with John Elder. Hastings operates a firearms manufacturing business, and he needed water to power his mill. The only place with a water supply sufficient for his use was the Elder ranch because a river flows through it. Hastings fears that the Elders may investigate Bass Elder's unsolved murder. Despicable dastard that he is, Hastings follows Sheriff Wilson out to the Lupin place late one evening and uses a high-powered telescopic rifle to blow Wilson out of the saddle. Of course, the Elders were nowhere nearby when Hastings shot the sheriff. Instead, the Elders were away herding 200 horses to market in Colorado that they bought from Charlie Bob Striker (Rhys Williams of "Our Man Flint") who had originally planned to sell the horses to their mother. Deputy Sheriff Ben Latta (Jeremy Slate of "The Devil's Brigade") bears a grudge against the Elders. Earlier, Latta tried to arrest the Elders for trespassing on Hastings' property, and the brothers disarmed him and then rode back to Clearwater to straighten things out with Billy. Meanwhile, Ben discovers an old wanted poster on Tom and jails the brothers. Initially, when Hastings shot Billy, he only wounded him, and Dr. Isdell awaits Billy to regain consciousness so that he can clear the Elders. Billy dies, however, and Hastings and his men incite a lynch mob to break the Elders out of jail. Billy's other older deputy, Charlie Biller (John Qualen of "Casablanca"), prompts Ben to take the Elders to Laredo so they can get a fair trial.Oscar winning film composer Elmer Bernstein wrote the flavorful orchestral score to "The Sons of Katie Elder," and it ranks as one of his more memorable efforts, among his scores for "The Magnificent Seven," "The Scalphunters," "The Great Escape," "Walk on the Wild Side," and "The Hallelujah Trail." Although "The Sons of Katie Elder" takes a long time to unfold, clocking in at 122 minutes, this John Wayne oater emerges as one of his best westerns. The cast is top-notch, especially Percy Helton as Mr. Peevey, the storekeeper. James Gregory makes a solid adversary, while Dennis Hopper is fine as his hot-tempered son. John Wayne could sleep walk his way through a role that he had grown thoroughly accustomed to playing from having made so many westerns over the years not only for Henry Hathaway but also for John Ford. Interestingly, Wayne garnered his only Oscar as best actor in another Henry Hathaway horse opera called "True Grit." "The Sons of Katie Elder" represented the second time that Wayne and Martin co-starred in a western. What sets "The Sons of Katie Elder" apart from most westerns as well as melodramas is how Hathaway skillfully paints our heroes into one hell of a corner that they cannot get out of without shedding their own blood as well as the blood of others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This well-known Western hasn't aged too well. It has a few good lines, and Wayne projects inimitable stage presence, but "The Sons" is too long by half, does not live up to its promise, and ends anticlimactically.George Kennedy excels as a menacing, sadistic hired gun but he isn't given enough to do. Dennis Hopper does well as a sniveling coward but neither is he used to advantage. Dean Martin brings his boozy reprobate to the frontier but wastes screen time as Wayne's ne'er-do-well brother. The Martha Hyer character is too much the moralistic schoolmarm but nevertheless manages to inject a little romantic interest into a film in which she's the only female. But even that comes to naught.I hardly ever notice the music in a film but this one's score is impressive. I enjoyed the way heroic music played whenever the brothers rode together as a crew. I write my reviews before seeing anyone else's. Now I'll go back and read what others have written to see what all the fuss is about, since to my mind "Katie" is an undeserved classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Duke With One Lung</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't usually comment or review any John Wayne movies because of the strong personal bias I have in favor of this great American and great actor!However the other day I watched The Sons of Katie Elder for the 50th. time.... or was that the 55th. time.... or perhaps the 60th. time for all I know. It's one of those rare movies that I can personally watch every six months and not be bored.A few of those other highly "watchable" John Wayne features are Donovan's Reef, In Harm's Way, and El Dorado. Most of the Duke's movies I consider easily viewable every 12-18 months under normal "Duke-view" conditions.(LOL)Sorry folks, they just don't make movies like this any longer. Some may say thank God, but I say why not! Movies/films are suppose to be above all about pure entertainment value. Movies aren't suppose to be reality based but should have a strong surrealistic nature to them with some fantasy overtones. FUN! That's why it's called acting.In this movie John Wayne is well, John Wayne!....at his best! Dean Martin plays a very low-key but important part. James Gregory, Paul Fix, Jeremy Slate, Dennis Hopper, George Kennedy and the rest of the cast are all at their best in this real good Henry Hathaway minor western classic.It was also the first movie John Wayne completed starring-in following his cancer surgery that removed one of his lungs. You will notice him "huffing and puffing" at certain times during many of the movie scenes. Especially when the script called for him to ride a horse and/or get active with other cast members. An oxygen tank followed the Duke wherever he went during filming for obvious reasons. The scene under the bridge when the brothers are being fired on by the bad guys, was a very demanding physical point for John Wayne in the movie.At times no one thought the Duke would ever finish this film. As Ethan Edwards said, "That'll be the day!"...pilgrim!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of John Wayne's best films. He has a strong supporting cast with him and a great musical score.But there is one moment I must note for you. There is a scene that has to be seen to be believed. George Kennedy ( as a bad guy) is dunking the head of an innocent man into a barrel. Wayne comes over, grabs a piece of wood that resembles a bat, and cracks Kennedy right in the face. It's a moment that causes the viewer great pain as he laughs at how real it looks. The timing is precise here and looks very painful.So by all means watch this film if only for that scene. But you will be well rewarded if you stick it out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is a decent one from the Duke. Dean Martin is his usual charismatic, charming, con man self. Earl Holliman plays one of the four brothers and it actually surprised me when he got killed. Katie Elder is never seen but a verbal portrait is painted over the length of the film of a tough, no nonsense, honest woman. Wayne plays the oldest and toughest of the brothers. A known gunfighter, not necessarily a hired gun though. The scenes when the three oldest gang up on the youngest, Bud, where they are going to see their mothers wish that at least one brother amounts to something admirable, are pretty funny. The frame up the bad guy pulls is kinda smart. Dennis Hopper does his usual fine acting as the cowardly son and of course he gets killed in the end. George Kennedy plays a gunslinger for hire and does a good job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thinking Man's Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bit of research provides this humbling realization--the most improbable parts of this film are the ones based upon reality. The wrongly-accused Marlow brothers DID resist a lynch mob and an ambush assisted by their guards, and in the end, the survivors found legal vindication.A sheriff and his deputy wait at the station for the expected arrival of a brother with a bad reputation. Instead, an obvious hired gun arrives, about whom they worry, about whom they do... nothing. John Wayne, eldest and most formidable of the Elder brothers, comes in the back way and even attends his late mother's funeral at a safe distance. One of the most interesting aspects to this film is Wayne's character's repeated refusals to fall into ambush, to do the stupid thing.Their parents are dead, the family impoverished, the scent of fish slowly rises as Wayne, particularly, but also Martin and a VERY strong cast of supporting actors gradually unspool the plot. A hired gun... an ambitious gunsmith and his son, even in his early days, Dennis Hopper did edgy and creepy with a master's abilities. Who ARE the good guys? The Director is honest enough to let the viewer go with his impulses to trust the Brothers--rightly, as it turns out.George Kennedy makes a creepy, convincing heavy, one with a psychopath's utter lack of concern for legality and a sadist's delight in inflicting pain. There are few scenes to rival his gleeful torturing of an inoffensive undertaker interrupted when he looks up to receive Wayne's pick handle in his face. Seldom is a steaming dish of come-uppance so satisfactorily served.The growing and utter hopelessness of the brothers' cause manifests itself with conviction. The villainy of the scheming antagonist grows more and more manifest until he murders his own son without any particular sign of remorse. There is an intensity here that rewards the careful watcher, there is a breadth to this film worth a bit of slow pacing in the second half.On the whole, a convincingly superior effort.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assembly Line Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By this time in the 1960's, John Wayne was running off film like an assembly line. Often the films would have the same supporting casts &amp; the stories we usually always Wayne is a good guy hero, who even though he is not perfect is still pretty good.This is one of 2 films Wayne did in the Western Genre with Dean Martin. While Wayne is just the Duke in this film, Dean Martin is actually cast in a pretty good role in this film as John Elders brother. Martin actually puts out one of his better dramatic performances in this film.The film was shot in Mexico &amp; the scenery is done with a good look to the camera. The music is solid too. James Gregory is the heavy in this one &amp; comes off quite well in his usual support. Strother Martin is fine in a supporting role as usual.This film gets run frequently on TV, as a lot of Dukes films are. This film is second in being run on TV only to the Rio Lobo &amp; Rio Bravo westerns which really get run a lot. All of these westerns are kind to John Waynes fans as they are good entertainment &amp; quite watchable.</fullReview>

No hamming around or false attempts at humor. This is the best acting he has done, in my opinion.Earl Holliman provides a solid, believable character that shows surprising strength of character.I really liked the part Michael Anderson, Jr. played. A hot-headed junior brother who tries to be his own man --- but is outclassed.The supporting cast does a great job.

		<fullReview>The Sons of Katie Elder probably is a fair representation of what life in the old west was like, OK, not exactly, but people have to remember that not only can you not judge this movie by the mores and ethics of today's society ( 2005) but you also can not judge what men where like in the old west. It was a hard life and frontier justice and frontier life was not a picnic. Men lived by the gun and died by the gun. It was the biggest, toughest, most guns that defended the land, not in the movies, but in real life.This movie portrays simply a family that came apart, due to the same things that tear families apart today, alcohol,gambling, differences of opinion, and pride. It also shows humanity at its worst and at its best. Judge the movie not on today's standards but on what history tells us life was like.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was hard for John Wayne in his later years to play the action hero. After Red River, he rarely got the girl. In the sixties, he often had help in the form of a teenage heartthrob and usually a middle-aged leading man. This film bears the weight of Big John as a non-action star, so it's down the list from some of his better films. It's still a good movie, though, best remembered now for its wonderful Elmer Bernstein score. Bernstein wrote two great western scores, The Magnificent Seven, and The Sons of Katie Elder. Elmer Bernstein is gone now, but his music will live as long as there are people to listen.The same can be said for Big John Wayne ? two hundred years from now, if there is two hundred years from now, people will watch his best work.The essential John Wayne includes:True Grit, The Searchers, She Wore a Yellow Ribbon, Fort Apache, Rio Grande, The Horse Soldiers.Wonderful stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made John Wayne western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has everyone in it, and most of them are John Wayne stock company regulars: Paul Fix, Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, George Kennedy, Dennis Hopper, John Doucette, John Qualen, Strother Martin, James Gregory, Jeremy Slate, James Westerfield and Karl Swenson. Most of these people had been in at least 1 Wayne movie before this one (some of them had been in 20 or 30 Wayne films together), and they all work together like a well-oiled machine.John Wayne's westerns are a lot of fun and lots of action, and this one is no different. John plays the elder, gunslinger brother of gambler Dean Martin, failed businessman Earl Holliman and college student Michael Anderson Jr., who all gather to see their mother, Katie Elder, buried. They set about finding out why their father was murdered and their mother railroaded off her ranch. The brothers get railroaded themselves, and end up fighting off the local bad guys. John wins in the end, of course, after fighting off the entire town to prove he's basically a good person.Dean Martin is great in this movie; easygoing, funny, ready to wager anyone anything. He was always good in westerns. John Doucette plays the undertaker; one of his better, more animated performances. His recollections with John about Katie are warm and personal. George Kennedy is fine as the hulking, brutish hired gun brought in by badman James Gregory to kill Wayne.This is a good, serviceable entry in the Wayne film archive. Try to see it in its widescreen version; it's a much different film when you see all the action.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first hour of this flick makes crystal clear . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . that John Wayne and Dean Martin's characters in THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER are stone-cold serial murderers; career criminals who've terrorized the people of Texas, Louisiana, and who knows how many more states. Martin's "Tom" would be on the FBI's "Ten Most Wanted List," had the Feds been around in the 1800s. Tom's made a career out of impoverishing normal people with various scams, and slaying any small businessmen who object to his turning their honest establishments into dens of thieves. Martin's movie big brother "John" is far worse, getting two Texas sheriff's killed through his reckless, loose-cannon ways in this brief plot alone. John fatally guns down several more deputies with his own two hands. John's guiding principle seems to be, "When you're in Texas, the thing to do is totally ignore or defy police orders, because all the cops there are gutless wimps." John closes KATIE by setting off a terroristic blast destroying half of Clearwater, TX. Quite a few of "Il Duce's" features climax in this fashion, which is why Wayne's later criticism of Clint Eastwood's ending for HIGH PLAINS DRIFTER is so hypocritical. Clint should have set "Il Duce" straight in that Mr. Eastwood's Modus Operandi is just to retrace Big John's footprints.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the opening scene with that locomotive spewing smoke out the top to that riveting Elmer Bernstein score I had a feeling this would be a top notch cowboy film....the director Henry Hathaway assembled a terrific cast...Earl Holliman, the Duke, Dean Martin...Martha Hyer, Dennis Hopper, the old character actor himself James Gregory and George Kennedy. Good to see Martin reunited with the Duke after the great performance he gave as a drunk and a bum in "Rio Bravo"....Martin had that inate ability to be very good in westerns. The Duke is at his best as the leader of the Elder brothers who must assemble and find out how their mother and father died so suddenly and losing all of their property and possessions. Great shot of the Duke standing on a mountain top as the Elder boys gather around Katie Elders funeral....the Duke standing there looking tall in the saddle so to speak...you got the impression right from the start of this film the Duke would be in control and get his revenge. The Duke goes into town to find some answers with his brothers and runs into roadblocks all over....the Sheriff played by the venerable Paul Fix wants him out of town and quick...the local banker lies and covers up Katie's estate and the man who wants control of the town, James Gregory wants the Duke to hi tail it out of town....to make sure the Duke doesn't cause any trouble he hires a gunslinger to take control.....to make matters worse the sheriff has a very high strung and emotionally out of control deputy who wants to confront the Elders at any opportunity. The town boss, Morgan Hastings kills the sheriff and tries to affix the blame to the Elders.....the deputy buys into it and chases the Elders relentlessly. Problem is the Elders down and out on their luck and out of money agree to go on a cattle drive...the sheriff and Hastings cuthroats follow them into a confrontation....after blowing away Kennedy the Duke and his brothers go back into town to confront Hastings....you know the Duke will nail Hastings to the wall at end....best scene in the film is when a nasty George Kennedy, the hired gun tries to bully the town mortician and the Duke arrives on the scene and smacks Kennedy with a Buford Pusser type block of wood right across the kisser.....plenty of fans in the audience back in the 60s loved that scene....the Duke taking no guff from any gunslinger!!! This is probably one of the Duke's best westerns ever....right up there with "She Wore a Yellow Ribbon", "Fort Apache", "The Searchers", "Alamo", "True Grit", "Rio Bravo" and "Big Jake".... the Dukes fans will love this western. This is nearly two hours of good, solid entertainment and you will love the Elmer Bernstein musical score. A must for Wayne fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER (Henry Hathaway, 1965) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is yet another of John Wayne&#x2019;s large-scale, crowd-pleasing Westerns: his films may have become increasingly out-of-touch, given the maturity the genre gained with the arrival of the Italian &#x201c;Spaghetti&#x201d; style and the work of Sam Peckinpah, but they were always solidly professional jobs which consistently delivered in the entertainment stakes. Actually, I too used to take these latter-day Wayne vehicles for granted (of his 70s work, for instance, I still have to catch up with the atypical McQ [1974] &#x2013; despite the fact that it&#x2019;s been a regular on Italian TV since my childhood days!) and, in fact, when this film itself turned up on local TV (in the P&amp;S format, of course), I watched it but didn&#x2019;t bother to record it&#x2026;and was even left unimpressed!! It may be due to the fact that I&#x2019;ve just gone through a run of The Duke&#x2019;s films in honor of his 100th Anniversary, but I found myself more receptive to it this time around: the plot, simple as it is, being nonetheless reasonably compelling as Wayne and his three brothers (Dean Martin, Earl Holliman and Michael Anderson Jr.) contrive to get to the bottom of their father&#x2019;s violent death and the ensuing loss of the family ranch to a greedy landowner (James Gregory); the latter has a wimpish son (Dennis Hopper), so he appoints a stout and aggressive gunman (George Kennedy) to defend him against the Elders. The film marked a reunion for Wayne and Martin after RIO BRAVO (1959) in somewhat similar roles (if not nearly as sparkling) &#x2013; a legendary man of action and a gambling rogue, respectively. Feminine interest is provided by Martha Hyer, while Paul Fix &#x2013; a stalwart of 27 Wayne films, and something of a mentor for The Duke himself &#x2013; has a particularly good role among the supporting cast of veterans.Interestingly, I&#x2019;m finding a lot of these films to be of a less brawling and broadly comic nature than I recalled; they all have their serious turns (for instance, three of the brothers here are wounded or killed by the end of it) and the villains and their cohorts are generally depicted as being anything but caricatures, rather they are believably dangerous! Still, it does acquiesce to formula now and then: although the historical figure of Katie Elder herself never actually appears, she&#x2019;s talked about by the townsfolk in a basically glorified manner; we&#x2019;re asked to believe Wayne and Michael Anderson Jr. (with an age difference of almost 40 years) as brothers, leading the elder (sic) siblings to patronize the boy incessantly &#x2013; and which, at one point, evolves into a completely gratuitous free-for-all among the clan!Buoyed by a typically majestic Elmer Bernstein score, the film rises to a pretty good extended climax &#x2013; which goes from an ambush beside a bridge to a siege in a barn and, finally, an explosive showdown between Wayne and James Gregory at the local gun depot. This was the fifth of six official pictures Wayne made under Hathaway&#x2019;s direction (his name is associated in an uncredited capacity with A LADY TAKES A CHANCE [1943] and he helmed one of the three segments which comprise HOW THE WEST WAS WON [1962], but not that in which Wayne himself appeared): it was an uneven collaboration which, however, culminated in TRUE GRIT (1969) &#x2013; the film for which the star finally won his Oscar...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good "meat and potatoes" western that makes for perfect matinée viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The death of their mother, Katie, brings the four elder brothers back into their home town. John is a gunslinger, Tom is a gambler, Matt owns a hardware store while young Bud is the only one of them that went to college. They are surprised to learn that Katie left no money from the sale of the family ranch and that she ended her days doing odd jobs to earn money for her keep. Looking closer they learn that the ranch was supposedly lost in a card game on the same night as their father was lost and, although the whole town thought good of her, it appears that Katie had been cheated.The most memorable thing about this western is just how sturdy a proposition it remains even today. It isn't a classic and it doesn't have much in the way of interesting subtext but it does produce plenty of solid material regardless. The plot is engaging as it trades off the relationship dynamics of the brothers as its base while developing the story on the way to a solid conclusion. Solid; Sturdy; neither words that offer much in the way of magic or impressive entertainment perhaps but then that is not what the film is about. To describe it in other words it is a meat and potatoes western and, to a Northern Irishman that is good enough. Sure it doesn't aspire to much but it does the basics very well and will give genre fans what they are looking for from a western from the period. The score is good while Hathaway turns in a solid (there's that word again) performance as director even if a lot of the film is on internal sets.The cast are lead by star turns from Wayne and Martin. Both men are good enough to deliver the workmanlike and reliable material but neither seems that interested in doing more than asked of them. They work well off one another but their characters are so easy for them that at times it seems they are drifting off. Anderson and Holliman force their performances, perhaps understandably due to the fame of their co-stars; they are still good though. Hyer has little to do and could easily have been lost from the film as a character while Slate, Fix and Gregory all do what the genre asks of them. Of note is a nicely twitchy character from a young Dennis Hopper.Overall then an enjoyably old fashioned western. It doesn't aspire to do much more than what it does and is therefore unlikely to ever be called a classic (apart from on DVD covers etc). However it is a solid meat and potatoes western that will please genre fans and makes for perfect matinée viewing (which was indeed when I watched it!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Sons Of Katie Elder has an unpretentious, but three-dimensional script thats a great mix of mystery, drama, and edge-of-your-seat thrills, along with fantastic direction by the great Henry Hathaway, and a nice re-teaming of John Wayne and Dean Martin, six years after Rio Bravo.One thing that struck me about the storyline, was that never in a movie have the villains had it so good but pushed their luck this far. The Elder boys had pretty much abandoned any thoughts of revenge and accepted the reality of their situation, when main heavy James Gregory's paranoia and pride get the better of him, sowing the seeds of his destruction and effectively snatching defeat from the jaws of victory!There's a great performance by character actor Jeremy Slate, as a straight-arrow, but arrogant junior deputy, who thinks he's independent, but ends up an unwitting stooge of Gregory.It was a mistake to have his character offed, near the beginning of the final act, just as he begins to come around. I think the character and the lesson he learned should have been incorporated into the film's finale.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Brothers without a good story!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four brothers (Wayne, Martin, Holliman and Anderson) teams up after their mother death just to figure out that the bad guy of the city (Gregory) murdered their father and robbered their ranch. So, the adventure begins. Unfortunately, this movie is a dissapointing example in Wayne's career and Hathaway (a regular director) gives a peasant treatment to the narrative that made this one a boring exercise. I give this a 5 (five).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The dumb son of Katie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This slow-paced Western is a typical example of how a dull action movie can be saved by Elmer Bernstein's powerful music score, just like he does to THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN and THE GREAT ESCAPE.Director Henry Hathaway's better films are those crime drama he made in the 1940s. Although he directed several John Wayne pictures in the 1960s, none of them is impressive enough to be treasured by Duke's fans.The film's simple revenge plot doesn't know how to start its action half of the time, it even lets the 4 brothers have a fistfight in their own house in order to arouse the sleepy audience.The scene where Dean Martin gets shot in the back by James Gregory is completely unbelievable, as he has Gregory's son (Dennis Hopper) at gunpoint but walks backward facing him. It never occurred to Hathaway that any fool would walk behind his hostage. I wonder why Martin would accept to do such a dumb thing in the movie?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne's Most Boring Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Sons of Katie Elder" is even more boring than "Wings of Eagles", both films make you glad that they invented the remote control so that you can effortlessly change the channel. "The Conqueror" deserves mention in this discussion but it was so unintentionally funny that the boredom is relieved.This is an ill-conceived (weak screenplay) and poorly executed (Hathaway's mind-numbingly static and bland direction) mess in a bright shiny Technicolor package.If you are even considering watching this listless turkey imagine what would happen if you combined "Bonanza" with the standard "Rio Bravo"/El Dorado" Wayne vehicle. Everything in the movie looks the same as the television westerns of that period, not the same are the four "brothers" who are supposed to look like they are related to each other. The absurdity of these four guys having the same mother (think Michael Landen and Dan Blocker), in and of itself prevents you from ever suspending disbelief and getting into it as a "movie". But thanks to the slow pacing you have plenty of time to think about that issue. Katie Elder must have had an extremely varied selection of lovers over a period of about a half century to have produced this brood.Escaped a one star vote on the curious appearance of a young Dennis Hopper still playing his wimpy character from "Giant" ten year earlier. When you figure Hopper was only four years away from his "Easy Rider" persona it is an interesting situation.Except for the self-reflexive parodies, "Westerns" had pretty much bottomed out by 1965 and "The Sons of Katie Elder" certainly did not win many baby boomers over to the genre. Thankfully guys like Sam Peckinpah and Robert Altman would soon come to the rescue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If Eli Wallach's line from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly comes to mind, "If you're going to shoot, shoot, don't talk" you're probably watching Henry Hathaway's tedious and yakky John Wayner, The Sons of Katie Elder. It's not that this oater is all that bad, it's just that Hathaway tries to infuse his western with a deeper moral meaning than the average 60's western, and gets bogged down in boredom for his efforts.There are some good performances here--Wayne is more mature and thoughtful (wouldn't you be after a bout with cancer?), veteran Paul Fix as the Sheriff stands out with a dyspeptic distrust of the Wayne and his brothers, and the character actor with the deep, gravelly voice who plays the mortician, John Doucette I think, puts in a very good bit as he tries to tell Wayne, who has been gone for ten years, that his father was murdered.The rest of the cast is okay or just puts in the motions. Dean Martin is restrained, as is Earl Holliman, but Michael Anderson, Jr. goes over the top as the youngest Elder. James Gregory puts in his time as the head bad guy and George Kennedy apparently was told to play a psychotic, hired gunman and, instead of thinking much about it, he came up with a sneering cartoon.The trouble with the movie is that Hathaway wants to mimic John Ford's emotional Wayne westerns, but just can't seem to get the fire to stay lit. There's real drama and tension is some scenes--especially Wayne and his brothers being shackled and transported to Laredo; it's uncomfortable watching the brothers Elder being humiliated--but then there are also some excruciatingly bad scenes with Martha Hyer and a ridiculous fist fight between the boys to lighten the load a bit.Not to nitpick, but the movie even is damaged by logic flaws and special effects mistakes. When Dean Martin is wounded, he keeps going and going like the Everready Bunny, even though the wound is obviously lethal, Wayne sports an 18-shooter, and in that big shootout under the bridge, the bad guys' rifles make smoke puffs, and then the bangs come out later.It's all sloppy enough to make you think that Warner Brothers and Henry Hathaway wanted to get a Wayne western out quickly before the Duke got sick again. Which is probably why the movie never takes off--you get the feeling you're being played here, not entertained.</fullReview>
