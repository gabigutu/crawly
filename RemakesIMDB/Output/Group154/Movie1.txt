		<shortDescription>How refreshing - a movie that actually exceeded my expectations!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you had ever told me that I would end up really liking a movie starring Marky Mark from the Funky Bunch and the lead singer of Outkast (the perpetrators of one of the most annoying songs in recent history - Hey Ya) then I would've laughed right in your face. Come on, a movie with three rappers (Tyrese throws down the rhymes also, yo!)? There's no way I would've expected that to satisfy my entertainment needs. But I'm man enough to admit that I would've been wrong.Four Brothers is a gritty, testosterone-fueled crowd pleaser that mixes drama, action, and humor. If you're looking for something light and fluffy then keep on looking because you won't find it here. But if you're in the mood to see some bad guys get pumped full of bullets and fists then this will put a smile on your face. The audience at the screening I attended was clapping and cheering throughout the movie. You'd have thought we were at a wrestling match.This plays out a bit like a Western. A wrong is done, a posse seeks to get revenge against the wrongdoers, and the wrongdoers are painted in such an unlikable fashion that you're just begging for them to taste a little vigilante justice.As for the good guys, well, they fall under the "anti-hero" moniker. They aren't scared to sidestep the law in order to get what they're after. But within the context of the movie you can't really blame their motives. Their mother adopted them when nobody else wanted anything to do with them. They were considered lost causes, yet she took them in, gave them a family, and put her faith in them.They didn't turn out to be saints, but as one cop says, "They're Congressmen compared to what they would've been." Now their mother, just an old lady always trying to do good, is dead and the cops don't seem to be doing anything about it. Wrongs have to be made right, and the brothers decide they're the ones that have to make it right.This is one of those movies that I figured I'd somewhat enjoy, but I walked out of the theater thinking, "Man, I didn't expect it to be THAT good!" It's rare that I find such a diamond in the rough, so I savor it as if I'm Rob Schneider at a stupid movie convention.One reason I had my doubts going in was I feared it might be drowned in loud, annoying hip-hop stylings. Plus, every Outkast song I've ever heard has made me want to gouge my eardrums with a letter opener, so I feared the worst from Andre Benjamin. "How annoying is this guy going to be?" I asked myself. But all my fears were unfounded. Instead, we're surrounded by a world of crooked cops, bad guys who wear man-furs, surprisingly good acting, believable chemistry, a couple of subtle twists, and a really cool car chase on ice. I'm always up for a good revenge flick, and I'm happy to report that this one exceeded my expectations.THE GIST Are you easily offended by violent revenge flicks? Then use your common sense and skip out on Four Brothers. But if that sounds like your kind of movie then I think you'll find this one works great within the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well Crafted Revenge Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm drawn to movies whose trailers inspire a visceral reaction...This one's is so clichéd...Poor old Mom gets whacked and her adopted sons go after the crooks...Still, the action in the trailer inspired me...gave me that feeling of wanting to see the bad guys get it, and after seeing the film, I can say I was not disappointed. The story moves along and does not step outside of itself. There are some intriguing plot twists, but the goal of revenge always remains. The performances are solid; we have experienced film actors and a director here who know what they're doing. Even the newer actors settle into their respective roles...John Singleton stated he wanted to do something with a "western edge" and in this film he has done just that. The story could be transplanted 100 years back and still work. While there is a great deal of action, violence, and bloodshed, it is not shot with an abundance of CGI or special effects...to that end, the action looks and feels more realistic. The film pulls you in and takes you for a nice ride, which is more than can be said of a lot of recent releases...It's not going to win Oscars, but it should be a hit. It's definitely worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie will get your attention and hold it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One good thing Steven Spielberg has done for 21th century movies is to show the importance of starting things off with a bang rather than a whimper, something he learned from the old grade B films of the 30's, 40's, and 50's. So when director John Singleton begins "Four Brothers" he doesn't dwell on background material about how mom came to be the shining star for her boys. Singleton goes right for the jugular by showing mom's demise--I say showing, the viewer doesn't actually see the killing in the beginning. Singleton builds up the relationship between mom and the brothers step by step, letting a Detroit policeman, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard), introduce the four brothers as they show up for the funeral and become reacquainted. Not to give away the story, one heavy leads to another until the whole city of Detroit becomes a personification of corruption and evil. I loved the Motown music played throughout the film which was very apropos for the setting.Even though the acting was first-rate throughout, I especially liked the performances given by Josh Charles as Detective Fowler and by Garrett Hedlund as Jack Mercer. I know Josh Charles has appeared in movies I have seen but I don't remember his acting standing out as it does in this film. Also Chiwetel Ejiofor was just right as the slimy egomaniac Victor Sweet--and what a name for a character this egregious.The action is first rate and there is plenty of it from start to finish. Hold on to your seats for the scary gun battle between mom's boys hold up in her old house and Sweet's hired thugs. You won't be able to get out of your seat during this shoot-out.I highly recommend this movie for fans of the genre. Others should enjoy it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Brothers = EXCELLENT</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, I'm a girl who normally loves "chick flicks" and comedies, so when I had nothing to do this evening and decided to go see a movie with my parents, (I thought they were seeing "Deuce Bigalow: European Gigalo"...but alas I was incorrect.) and discovered we were going to see "Four Brothers", I was a little upset. I'm normally not one for movies that are seemingly all about people getting revenge and lots of killing and fighting. I dunno..I'm not one for the action/drama type...unless it's a horror movie, and then I'm definitely there. Anyways, I was genuinely surprised at how good this movie ended up being. Each of the four brothers gave an amazing performance. Andre Benjamin showed that he's not only a talented singer, but a talented actor as well.The movie was much better than I had expected. I laughed, and I (almost) cried. It went through a range of so many different emotions and events in the lives of the four troubled men, all adopted when they were children by one amazing woman who became their world. I don't really know what else to say without spoiling the movie, so I'm going to just leave you with all of what I've said, and the fact that I would most definitely recommend this movie to anyone and everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very well done action/drama.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember first seeing the trailer for this movie about a year ago before a movie I watched last summer and thought it looked very promising. A year later I had almost forgot about it until I started seeing commercials on TV and I got my hopes high. To be honest, this is probably the first movie that met my expectations.I didn't go in expecting the greatest movie ever, I mean it does have Marky Mark in it and I'd hate to think he's be the start of my favorite movie of all time. But I did expect it to be exciting, emotional, and engaging... And it was.One of the things this movie does best is show the love and commitment between the brothers. The chemistry between the actors was excellent and really added to the feel of the film. It takes a lot to get emotion out of me in a movie, I'm talking the beginning of Saving Private Ryan a lot, so I unfortunately didn't feel as much as some of the other people in the theater, but you know something is right when people cheer when the main characters kill bad guys and yell "NO!" when things don't go right. The emotions between the brothers also led to many very funny comic moments, which I did not expect to see as many as I did. I laughed many times.Singleton is probably a better write than director, but he does a decent job through out. Most of the film is simple camera angles and what not, but there were a few moments, specifically a car chase, that was shot really well. It was all done in a manor that kept it realistic while keeping it interesting. It should also be noted that this movie had the SECOND most intense shoot out I've ever seen in a movie. Second only to, of course, the LA streets shoot out in Heat which, in my opinion, is the most intense 15 minutes ever filmed.Acting was decent. Like mentioned before, the chemistry between the brothers was great, but there were many simple one-liners and Mark Wahlberg seems to play the same character way too often. Not really acting so much as reading lines in a tough way.While this isn't the #1 movie of the year it definitely met my expectations and is a very, very good summer action flick of not more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Brothers Gets 4 Stars In My Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As the Summer is winding down that means a couple things. One is that Fall/Winter feel-good, and more animated movies than you can count are coming to theaters. Also, it also means that the Summer Movies of 05 are closing. HOO-RAYYY!!! But wait hold on, before it is gone one of few good movies sneaks in. It is the new John Singleton movie Four Brothers, and what a good one it is.Four Brothers is about four adopted degenerates whose mom is murdered and they come back to their old camping ground to, one bury her, and the other, to look for her killers and bury them as well. It starts out fantastic, then loses a little steam, and at the end comes together perfectly to have you talking about it at the water cooler the next day.Mark Walbergh, Garrett Hedlund, Andre 3000, and Tyrese Gibson play the four brothers and do a fantastic job as playing the delinquents. They really look like they're right out of the mean streets of Michigan. They also act and speak like it as well. So if you're thinking about taking little kiddies (5-12) you might want to make sure they can handle it because there is enough profanity and shooting to go around. So, if you are looking for a good film this Summer, check one out you might pass over called Four Brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like revenge flicks?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always loved revenge movies, and this one fits the bill because it has four brothers trying to find out the truth of their mother's murder. The four brothers are all superb in their roles, as adopted brothers from foster care that went their separate ways, who come home to find out who killed their mother and why. The 8 minute AOL trailer on the movies sold me. Also superb is Terrence Howard as a Detroit cop who doesn't trust his own who is desperately trying to find out what happened himself. The plot is well executed through twists and turns. Mark Wahlberg just gets better and better. He was great in "Three Kings," and he is better here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A refreshing change to what is normally coming out today</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had been scoping this movie since it was called "Untitled Mark Wahlberg Project'. Being directed by John Singleton and starring Mark Wahlberg it looked promising. I knew I wanted to see it after reading 5/5 reviews and seeing entertaining trailers of it. Eventually I saw it for a friends's birthday party, and I was impressed!A standout thing in this movie is that it perfectly combines the action, comedy and drama genres together. At times it can have you laughing out loud, others it can have you quite sad and on the edge of your seat in excitement viewing the great action scenes.The four lead actors do a great job. Mark Wahlberg plays a character which is different from what he normally plays and he pulls it off well. Andre Benjamin (or Andre 3000 from OutKast) does a great job too. He is definitely much better than just the usual rapper turned actor.The story is great. It has a much thicker plot than what would be expected from a revenge movie. In fact, that is another standout thing, the original storyline.Overall this is definitely a movie you should see. A refreshing change from the comedy remakes we normally see coming out of the theater. One that will be on my to buy list.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, recommend it to just about anyone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see the movie last night and I really wasn't sure what to expect going in, and I must say I'm very impressed with the results. Despite a few hitches (how cliché this movie really is, I.E. revenge), it really did deliver. All four of the brothers delivered the flavor that this movie probably would have needed and I must say that the screenplay must have been superb. This movie pays the obvious homage to Death Wish and it's been quite overdone, but not without receiving the credit it deserves.If you like action drama, then I'd recommend you go out and pay the $8 to see it. I don't think you'll be too disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun 60-70's like movie. Revenge is sweet.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was ready to bet that this was a remake after an older movie. Great 60's and 70's music, the endless theme of the small town terrorized by a villain and the rise to justice of the people involved, Mark Wahlberg... ;) OK, I am unfair to the man, but it's true isn't it? He is always cast into old looking movies or remakes. I actually like how he is playing. I think that he is a reasonable actor and has potential beyond the action movies in which we've become accustomed to seeing him.The plot is quite simple: adoptive mother of four and town saint gets killed by thugs. The four brothers kick ass accordingly. But beyond the obvious cliché, the movie was quite good. The actors played well, the feelings were nicely transmitted to the audience and the details were realistic enough and emotion conveying. Actually, for this kind of movie, I am ready to grade high.The bad thing about this film were the villains. Unconvincing small time crooks that suddenly have the power to hire people with Steyr Augur rifles and other high power weapons. Unconvincing crooked cop who has no motive for actually being corrupt. In the end, the movie is rather relaxing, considering we never meet anything unexpected.Worth a watch, although I would rate it as a TV movie, to watch in bed, rather than a cinema thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A confused, mediocre effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't find this movie to be unwatchable or one of the worst I've seen, as many have commented on here. It's also not a brilliant piece of film making.The characters were so stereotypical and predictable (cookie-cutter gangster, generic tough guys with hearts of gold, good cop, bad cop, crooked politician, kind old lady, fiery Latina, etc...), it was hard to develop much serious interest in any of them. I found a lot of scenes highly comical; the problem is, I wasn't sure I was supposed to be laughing. When the movie obviously tried for comic relief, I just sighed. It was during the highly "dramatic" or heart-felt scenes where I found myself laughing hysterically. The dinner table scene where each of the four brothers remembers "Mom" was so bad, it made me cringe and laugh out loud at the same time. I think this confusion persists throughout the movie. It's never clear how seriously we're supposed to take any of this.The plot is full of gigantic holes and leaps in logic. However, movies do require a certain suspension of disbelief, so I'll let most of it slide. The characters are mere cartoons, so nothing feels real anyway. The most real thing here is the setting in Detroit. It looks gritty, cold, abandoned and dangerous. I'm sure Detroit residents weren't thrilled by the city's portrayal in this movie (although it may be at least somewhat accurate).It's hard to judge any of the acting, because the writing and direction are so uneven and mediocre. Overall, this felt like a decent made-for-TV movie. The plot, direction and acting were on par with a predictable TV crime drama.5 out of 10 from me. It didn't make me snooze, but I certainly wouldn't recommend this to anyone either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Four Brothers get their revenge for a price</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Synopsis) Four adopted brothers come together to bury their mother (Fionnula Flanagan) who was killed during a grocery store robbery in Detroit. The brothers see the video tape of the robbery and believe that she was marked for death and murdered by the two thieves. The four brothers Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Jack (Garrett Hedlund), Angel (Tyese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) want revenge. They don't think the police will find the murderers, so they start looking into the crime themselves.(Comment) The film shows that the children of a murder victim suffer greatly after losing a loved one, and their first thought and reaction is for revenge against the criminal. You feel the chemistry and connection that these four actors have in playing their parts. Even though the four men were adopted and are of different races, you will see their love and interaction as brothers. This is an adult family movie with a lot of humor, action and realistic brutality. The storyline has it all, a crime boss, hired killers, good and bad cops, corrupt politicians, and victims. The ending is heartening, but sad. This is a must see. (Paramount, Run time 1:48, Rated R) (8/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film only has a handful of main problems, which I shall outline below:1) Terrible storyline 2) Terrible script 3) Terrible actingOverall, the film was utterly abysmal, but there were a few scenes that were particularly vomit inducing. If I didn't live on the ground floor, I probably would have thrown myself out of a window whilst watching this film. Here are a few of the worst scenes:When the brothers find out that it was an execution, and they march off down the street, with macho swinging arms. Pathetic.All of the "dream" sequences with their mother talking to them. Cringe inducing. I almost cried for the actors having to do these scenes. Any scene containing Marky Mark.The fist fight at the end was embarrassing. Neither character kept their hands up, they both should have been knocked out.The car chase. Terrible. Most cars, let alone automatics, couldn't do any of that stuff on ice. Overall, I hated all the characters, they were terribly acted, terribly written parts, and they were all thugs. Worst film ever (even more so than Lawnmower Man 2).</fullReview>

I like Mark Wahlberg very much, so it was a pleasure to see him here,and I liked the other actors who played the other ''Mercers'' as well. (Garrett Hedlund is a cutie!

But they are not simple people: they are delinquents, each one having worst qualities or problems then the other. When they discover that their mother's death had more things behind that what was said, a lot of actions starts to happen!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the four horsemen of....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>when John Singleton released Boyz n the Hood, i thought wow, a young, brilliant director with a future full of potential; a young genius with more exquisite films to come. Four Brothers could be the best film he's made since then, pulling great performances from Mark Wahlberg who surprised me so much in Boogie Nights, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund, and Terence Howard, who is always so good. And the score in his films is usually so fine. i didn't know rap qualified as music until i heard it in Boyz. And it's great here too. this film is stylish, poignant, active, and has some very clever moments. I don't think it's fair to compare this film to his others, but it is in stark contrast to the message he portrayed in his first film, that violence begets violence, that violence solves nothing, and that the worst in us has a chance at redemption. his themes of poverty, hopelessness, misdirection, and role models aren't really here. ironic, since their kindly and compassionate foster mother mentored a sense of safety, love, and acceptance in their make-shift family. instead, what we have here is a revenge film, vigilante justice, well-constructed scenes of brutality and violence. the background details were just fine, with it's fargoesque winter scenes, flash-backs, chases, and personalities, unexpected turns of events. Four Brothers is an entertaining film for adult audiences and worth a watch. but i am still waiting for Mr Singleton to make another masterpiece. This isn't it, but i'm still hoping that it's coming.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film deals with four brothers (Mark Wahlberg , Andre Benjamin, Garret Hedlund and Tyrese Gibson) . They reunite one time their mother (Fionnula Flanagan) has been murdered into a grocery store hold-up . But the happenings aren't as predictable as they might understand . Then , they come to revenge and take the law on their own hands . Meanwhile , Lieutenant Green (Terence Howard) and Lt Detective Towler (Josh Charles) are attempting to resolve the case and track down the killers and the four brothers . The investigation of the killing reveals many suspects and dark activities involving to criminal mobster (Chiwetel Esbofor) and Detroit Councilman (Barry Shakaba ), among others.The picture packs action-packed , intrigue, thrills , and lots of violence and blood . It's an entertaining and suspenseful story, plenty of twists and unexpected turns . Excellent action scenes with noisy shoot-outs and spectacular car races . Interesting and thrilling script based on Haenry Hathaway's ¨The sons of Katie Elder¨. Cool performances by Mark Wahlberg as tough and hard-edged brother and Terence Howard as good police inspector, among them . Almost all of Mark Wahlberg's lines were improvised , Garrett Hedlund had difficulty improvising his lines, so John Singleton and Mark Wahlberg helped him through it . Furthermore , magnificent secondary cast , such as Sofia Vergara , Kenneth Welsh and Barry Shakaba . Glamorous cinematography by Peter Menzies Jr. and stirring musical score fitting to action by David Arnold . The motion picture was well directed by John Singleton . He's a nice director , his first movies were quite thoughtful and brooding (Boyz in the Hood , Poetic justice , Higher learning), but today he usually makes intelligent action films (Fast and Furious 2 , Baby boy , Shaft). The film will appeal to action lovers buffs and Mark Wahlberg fans . Rating : Better than average . Well catching .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four times the mayhem in "Four Brothers"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit "Four Brothers" is not a movie I was giddy about seeing. I didn't have really high expectations and why should I, much less you? Well, if you do have high expectations, you better lower them, because "Four Brothers" is not a deep and involving picture but is really more of a straight-forward action flick with a few sly one-liners thrown in for good measure.There's not a single wince of brain activity throughout it, though the four "brothers" of the title (Mark Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson, Garrett Hedlund), explained by one character as being "total f**k-ups," do express a convincing degree of unity in that you actually believe they're related through their deceased, adopted mother Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan).Wahlberg is Bobby Mercer, the courageous tough-talking eldest brother and the one with a chip on his shoulder. Not surprisingly, he does the most talking and is the obvious leader. Benjamin is Jeremiah Mercer, the only one of the four to really make something of himself in that he has a legitimate business, a wife (Taraji P. Henson) and children, and the closest ties to their mother. Gibson is Angel Mercer, a (former) soldier of fortune who has the ladies (including feisty Latina Sofia Vergara), the bragging rights, and the connections. Lastly, Hedlund is Jack Mercer, the youngest and grungiest of the four who's also a wannabe rocker and had the most troublesome childhood of them all.The four are reunited at the funeral of their dear mom, who was viciously slain in a liquor store robbery. The brothers suspect that because of the particularly heinous nature of the crime, their mother may not have been some innocent bystander but was really executed, and the robbery itself was just there to throw off the cops.After much contemplation and not even bothering to heed the warnings of two flaky detectives (played by Terrence Howard and Josh Charles), the four go after their mom's killer. It shouldn't be any surprise that they find their mother had been inadvertently drawn into the middle of some big insurance scheme or something along those lines (it's not really all that well explained), so the brothers look to settle the score with anyone - everyone.As directed by John Singleton (whose outstanding landmark 1991 debut "Boyz N the Hood" remains the pinnacle of his career), "Four Brothers" is loud, dumb, and violent. The plot does a little more than resemble "The Sons of Katie Elder" (1965), which I haven't seen, but I doubt it was as lacking in intelligence as "Four Brothers."However, the movie should be praised because it is strangely appealing (the totally PC leads notwithstanding), and the action is fast and furious, culminating in an impossible car chase through the ice-slicked Detroit streets during a snowstorm. And Singleton shows he hasn't completely lost my respect in that he's a good director during these scenes and succeeds in creating a believable atmosphere of unity amongst the four brothers.I expect this movie to be a success, since it's the last week of the summer and the August season of blockbusters has passed. But hey, it's the last week of the summer, "Four Brothers" is playing, and so don't everybody rush to the theaters. OK?7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the soundtrack is by far the best part of this film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was definitely looking forward to this movie, which is not hard to imagine for a John Singleton movie, especially with the cast its got. I love Mark Wahlburg, and couldn't wait to see Andre Benjamin's big screen debut, bla, bla, bla, BUT what a total disappointment! Actually those two were good, Tyrese too, but the story and dialogue were weak at best. I spent most of the movie wondering why people were doing what they were doing, why I should care about these thinly drawn, backgroundless and insubstantial characters, and who wrote that weak and chiche' dialogue that started out bad, oversimplified, and patronizing, and stayed that way. I kept wanting it to get better, and that was all that kept me from walking out before it was over.This movie is sloppy...for example...The opening scene in the store, does anyone find the mother's scolding words to the shoplifter believable at all? As if he'd be in there stealing one Tootsie Roll! What kid from Detroit that age would be duped by that "I'm on hold with the police" act? Why do they continue to allude to the youngest brother's "bad things in his past" but never resolve it. And for that matter they make it seem like it was some sort of sexual abuse but the guy is comfortable enough to shower in the open bathroom with people walking in and out? And if all four of them were such "lost causes" and "bad kids" and whatnot, don't they all have big issues in their pasts, why just make us aware of the one and none of the others? Where did the gun go when Tyrese goes to the cop's house, he answers the door with a gun behind his back and then when they get into the fight, he never even raises the hand where the gun is. Why? Where did it go? At the end when they're on the frozen river, driving on fresh snow in one shot and then following multiple car tracks in the next. AND when they're all standing around and the camera goes to a wide shot, WHY do you see all of those rectangular melted spots in the ice where there were obviously other vehicles parked. (production vehicles perhaps?) WHY SO THOUGHTLESS AND SLOPPY from such an otherwise quality filmmaker?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not worth a dime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>have seen this one the other night and i'm very disappointed to say the least. according to IMDb votes and reviews this should be at least beyond average with fine acting and a nice story. Now as i find, this movie has so many holes in its plot, one might assume the script got shot during one of the action scenes. ridiculous twists in the story, very very VERY bad sequences that are simply unbelievable and that do not make much sense in the course of action (sometimes it is like Charles Bronson's Disney) and a cast that doesn't fit together at all. Now i realize that this is an adaption of Katie Elder and that it might not be that easy to transform a wild west story into today's world, but still as a writer/director you have to take care that the story conveys some realism, otherwise it gets laughable/boring and you as a viewer can't care less for what happens to the characters. unfortunately the filmmakers failed big time here and all their trying to give their characters a life and the storyline a ground was heavily countered by their sledgehammer-style in every way. not to mention the unreflected use of violence against ANYBODY with a big smile on the face which makes the major premise of the film that the old lady did a good job raising problematic boys and changing their life to the better, a big fat lie. just do not waste your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor acting and a stupid story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty often a bad movie has a bad rating on this site after enough people have seen it. This is not the case with some of the really bad action movies, especially the ones that contain some decent action but besides from that are completely worthless.This is the case with Four brothers, the story makes no sense, and the acting is very poor. Usually I am one of those that has to finish watching a movie no matter how bad it is, just to see if it might not improve somewhat, but this movie was so bad that I actually had to turn it of halfway in. And no, I am pretty sure it did not get any better.(For the record, I did not even turn of "the stone merchant" (for those of you who have seen it), but painfully watched the full movie the other day. Something which surely must tell you how bad a movie must be before I turn it off.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some marginal actors got coaxed into this nothing-but-violence waste of time. Bunch of unruly people with guns shooting at each other (and the bad guys are the worst marksmen). Cars chase each other, crash but still keep going. They crash again and still keep going. A few more times, crash, BANG. Nobody is around to see or hear what must have been a loud chase although it is in the middle of a city. And how convenient for nobody else to be on the road. Bad guys, good guys. Bad cops, good cops. And more stuff you've never seen before. The real victims in this one were the people who wasted money to watch it.The end (thought it would never get there)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie, did expect it to be as good as it was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Went to see a preview of it two nights ago, and was presently surprised with it. Very good movie. Despite the fact that it's about four brothers avenging their mothers death, there is a lot of humor in it. The brothers give each other sh*t all the time, but you can tell they love each other. Mark Whalberg (sp?) did a good job, but i think my favorite character was Jackie, played by Garrett Hedlund. There was a lot of action, a lot of violence, very graphic, but it was well done and believable. Not exactly a movie for children, but it's a family movie. All in all, it's very funny and uplifting (towards the end), but very sad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not even pass marks for this. So 4 rehabilitated youths gone wrong suddenly revert to killing and firing guns all over a town. I know their step mum got murdered but it just doesn't gel. The way they go from bad boys to good boys then back to bad boys without a second thought is so unreal. The script is weak and poor. No matter how many bullets are flying or people are killed no one seems to phone the police. The brothers flash guns whenever it pleases - even in a school gym hall when a basketball is in full fling, but no one runs for cover. Sure there is plenty of action. But it's a disappointing and dumb movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The dialogue in this film should win an award, i didn't know if it was intentional but it reminds me of a blaxpoitation comedy spoof.Not a single believable character in the whole film. Hilariously bad."I love you cos u is ma bro " and "we love our momz".This film has all the empathy and heart of dead wooden fish in a bucket of sand.Right from the start the 4 "brothers" seem totally unconnected to each other. They however love each other even thou its not clear as to why they should.But no worries they get back up to speed by talking to some random barman.Then follows the usual infinite bullets and car chase scenes (YAWN).Im sure the script was written by a 13 year old boy in the projects as a school project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ridiculous plot and muddled directing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has great marketing and and an awful product. The plot is silly and unbelievable. Apparently the budget did not include extras for any of the "shoot out shots" (whether police of bystanders). Furthermore, the "climax" which you have to see to believe requires a suspension of disbelief of which anyone not on life support will not be able to make. Stay away. I am at a complete loss after reading the "external reviews" and can only conclude that there are 2 movies with the same title being released in different parts of the country.I predict that word of mouth will end this movie's box office life in reasonably quick order. However, I'm sure it will outdraw "The Great Raid" which is an entertaining quasi-historically correct movie that leaves the viewer satisfied.The only upside to Four Brothers is that it made me appreciate Joe Dirt and 3000 miles to Graceland. (Which I used to think were the 2 of the worst movies I had ever seen).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I adore this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot for the life of me figure out just why I haven't reviewed this yet. But here goes.I've always loved this movie. I think I really wanted to watch it when I did is because I had a huge crush on Garrett Hedlund when I was in high school. So I was determined to watch everything he was in. Anyway, you have four adopted brothers Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), Angel (Tyrese), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) who return home after the mysterious death of their mother. Now when I say mysterious, it was cold blood but we just don't know why exactly they killed her. We meet them though Officer Green's (Terrence Howard) description of them to his new partner. It turns out they each have some sort of negative connotation but who cares? lolThe story: The story is elaborate and can get a bit confusing. Even to this day I find myself always trying to pay close attention to figure out just what the problem Victor Sweet had with Evelyn Mercer. I always know that it has something to do with her being nosy about what Jeremiah was doing and getting mixed up in, but some things can get a bit muddled and I think the initial story is a bit overshadowed by the violence/action. Especially once it is revealed that the new cop Fowler is involved. Which those things aren't bad, it just doesn't particularly help the plot, in fact, it kind of obscures it. You just have to really pay attention, the story plays out but you have to make sure you're listening and watching.The Acting/Characters: I think they all did a great job. I think the casting was wonderfully done. The main four had great chemistry and I liked the idea of having a mixed family of black and white brothers especially since they all were bad ass. Bobby was a great character, the eldest brother who seemed to have the most issues. Jeremiah was secretive but not very discreet, Angel... the soldier, brash and Jack, the sensitive rock star baby of the family. The actors portrayed their characters very well. I thought the relationships were fleshed out well. I mean, say what you want about the story but these four were the heart and when Jack dies... (I cry always), it really makes them rethink what they're doing. I loved these four so much, when I first saw the movie, being the writer that I am, I wrote a back story to each one. We don't know really anything about their past, the moment when they have flashback memories at the dinner table was a great scene. That is when we can see how three of the four brothers remember their mother and Jack's moment with her is most compelling (even compared to Bobby's scene at the end of the movie).Overall: I've always loved this movie. The action is great, the humor is funny, the characters are likable and unlikable if supposed to be, the acting is good, the soundtrack is freaking AH-MAZ-ING and it's worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The plot is very slow after the initial murder of Evelyn Mercer and this may have put many off. It does, however pick up towards the middle third and by the end it has reached full throttle. The gritty realism of the story is enhanced by the winter scenes on the streets of Detroit. I can't say I was overly enthused by the choice of music throughout, but then it's not really my scene man. The performances were all excellent with Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson taking most of the spotlight, but I thought nobody put a foot wrong throughout. Over all a gritty realistic and sometimes brutal revenge thriller. Maybe a little too slow for some in the beginning but the pace does pick up (I promise).SteelMonster's verdict: RECOMMENDEDMy score: 7.2/10You can find an expanded version of this review on my blog: Thoughts of a SteelMonster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is an excellent action movie with a solid storyline. These are characters that you care about and there is some terrific action from John Singleton. The evening car chase in the snowy streets of Detroit is a classic. This movie is highly underrated. All four of the "brothers" are excellent in their roles. The villain is really twisted and the conclusion is quite satisfying. In my experience, people who dislike action movies like this film. But it also satisfies the need for plenty of action. You will get into the story and root for the brothers. There are some very humorous aspects to the brothers' relationships with one another as well and some very interesting plot twists. Mark Wahlberg is at the top of his game. The theme song is "Trouble Man" by Marvin Gaye which fits perfectly. Check it out !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Revenge Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four adopted brothers return to Detroit after their adoptive mother gets killed during a convenience store hold up. Turns out the seemingly random act of violence was anything but random and the four brothers (two white, two black) must come together to find out the truth behind their mother's death and take revenge against those responsible. Great acting jobs by Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund as three of the four brothers. Sofia Vergara provides lovely visuals. The Motor City looks as gritty as it ought to be. Wahlberg turns in yet another performance where he's not really forced to show any real acting chops -- just mostly scowl, toss off a few one-liners and kick butt and take names later. Not that this is a bad thing, because he's quite good at what he does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me say right off the bat, normally this would not be my kind of movie. I am strictly a romantic-comedy, buddy-cop movie screwball comedy gal all the way. Usually. But I watched this movie with a friend, and it surprised the hell out of me how much I loved it. The story is four brothers who were all adopted come home to find out exactly why their mom died. I thought it would be too violent but and while there is violence the movie is so amazing it makes up for it. The story is told beautifully and is acted wonderfully by the four leading men, and because of them and how the story is told it makes you care about them and want their sweet departed mother to be avenged. This movie never goes where you think it's going to and keeps you wondering and waiting until the very end. An extremely well put together movie, I'd recommend for anyone, even if you're not a big drama like me, cause hey, you might like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly Human and Very Enjoyable for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was a big surprise for me. Sure the main central plot is about revenge - which the movie delivers on big time. But the big surprise was how the movie explores the relationships within this family of four brothers and their mother. I come from a large family and it rang very true for me. The humour, the ragging, the arguments but when push comes to shove - coming together. When family knocks on the door, you have to let them in.I found the location, character portrayal and violence very gritty and realistic. There is no over-idealisation of life, and yet plenty of humour there too.I found it a very satisfying mix of human and revenge, with revenge being the very good icing on a great cake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad joke set-up turns into a reasonable film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so four brothers walk into a bar, two white guys and two black guys.Far from the start of a bad joke setup this is actually a key element of this film.::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: The four guys were all children from troubled or unfortunate situations taken in by the same caring lady who raised them as solid citizens ? or at least better than how they may have turned out ? a couple of the lads are still quite rough around the edges. The four have grown and gone their separate ways and blazed their own personal trails, they are brought back together after the untimely death of "Ma" in an apparently random shooting in a Detroit convenience store robbery.With Ma's funeral looming the four boys all arrive home to pay their last respects: Bobby (Marky Mark Wahlberg) ? A straight talking, fast acting loose cannon.Jack ? A somewhat introverted musician. Cops some flak as the other boys (Bobby at least) openly ponder if he's gay.Jeremiah (Andre "3000" Benjamin) ? The most successful of the quartet. A businessman developing his own premises with a stable home, wife and family. He is affable, honest and ambitious.Angel (Tyrese Gibson) ? A simple man with big muscles and simple needs.The early going has the boys reminiscing about their childhood and their time with Ma, in one particular scene they all have extremely vivid visions or recollections or what life was like with her around. In fact the entire first 40 minutes play out slowly with a fair element of emotion and character development, the boys joke, bicker, (play)fight and discuss what was and what might have been.Then Bobby announces to one and all that they owe it to Ma to find out exactly why she died and who is responsible, then this carefully constructed "family drama" all of the sudden turns into a straightforward shoot 'em up kill the bad guys affair.The early investigations are relatively low key ? at least compared to what follows ? but they do raise enough dust to bring the attention of the local cops who, are already familiar with the boys due to previous dealings. The cops (Terrance Howard and some other guy) warn them against starting their own personal revenge war.It seems the lads just don't listen. The second half of the film has running gun battles including one that essentially destroys their childhood home. There are shootouts, car chases and multiple killings ? essentially enough bad stuff for them all to be arrested 447 times.Ultimately they follow the trail to the real killer, which leads to another massive scale gun battle and other events that overstep the realms of plausibility? by about 15 steps.Four Brothers starts with a reasonably serious tone, but finishes with a cartoony second half and some jaw dropping plot holes or at requires leaps of logic that are hard to take. The four boys do well to keep a straight face through most of it and the performances are all OK, Sofia Vergara is suitably over the top ? both in performance and tank top ? in her role as Angel's screeching hot tempered girlfriend, and the "Bad Guy" is suitably menacing, if perhaps the most cartoony of all.Final Rating ? 5.5 / 10. I'm not sure if I am that disappointed with the fact this film takes a turn towards the ludicrous, the second half is definitely more entertaining even if it seems to be at odds with the patient build up of the first half.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sons of Evelyn Mercer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund co-star in this gripping tale of brotherly love, betrayal and revenge from acclaimed filmmaker John Singleton. After their adoptive mother is gunned down during a grocery store holdup, the estranged brothers reunite to seek revenge and take matters into their own hands. Defying police orders, the four begin turning their old Detroit neighborhood upside down searching for the mastermind behind the brutal killing. Along the way, they discover they are bound by ties thicker than blood in this emotionally powerful, action-packed drama," according to the DVD sleeve description.Before you know what happened, a random connivance store hold-up has become a hit, which later turns into an intricately plotted Detroit City street war. John Singleton's "Four Brothers" succeeds in portraying some of the camaraderie you'll find between different urban dwelling denizens. Although set in the present, the style and music suggest the "hippie" era - we open with Jefferson Airplane's "Somebody to Love" and advance to "Motown" oldies, then incidental funk. And, it's done as a modern western, like "The Sons of Katie Elder" (1965). Terrence Howard contributes believable support. But, this is all finding "anything nice to say." **** Four Brothers (8/12/05) John Singleton ~ Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For the today-teenage girl...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the trailer of this movie when I was like 8 (now I'm 13). As you might think, all my boy friends wanted to watch "Four Brothers" because of the blood and the guns. And all my girl friends (including me) said it surely was a really stupid movie with a bunch of guys just shooting to each other and that we were going to get traumatized. OK, I was just 8 years old, I didn't know anything about movies (not that I know something now).But I saw this movie last Saturday evening, alone in my parents bedroom while they were cooking and watching TV and I actually liked it. I mean, sure, I was a bit scared during the whole movie and I even yelled when Evelyn got shot but I still liked it. It woke "something" up inside of me. First I loved Mark Wahlberg's acting, I always had him as a very funny guy and now even more. André was OK but Tyrese was the ladies man/loser we all know and love because he always gets the crazy chick and everyone else knows that she is mental except of, obviously, him. I loved Garrett Hedlund (&lt;3), mainly because he is the youngest, most innocent and (for me) the cutest. But I also loved his acting, because he was funny and the sad scenes were real. I wanted to jump inside the screen and hug him... It's needless to say I cried when he got shot :(So for me, it was a great movie and I would see it again, and again, and again. :)PS: Sorry if something doesn't make any sense. I've been studying English since I was 2 but I guess I still need more practice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not As Good As "The Sons of Katie Elder"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Boyz N the Hood" director John Singleton's new movie "Four Brothers" looks a whole lot like a blaxploitation version of the vintage John Wayne &amp; Dean Martin western "The Sons of Katie Elder" (1965) with only half of its conspiracy plot but none of its larger-than-life panache. In this quasi-remake of sorts, Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garret Hedlund are convincing enough as the rough and tough title siblings in contemporary Detroit who take "Death Wish" style vigilante justice into their own hands to rub out the cold-blooded thugs that singled out their mom for execution during an otherwise routine convenience store hold-up. When Singleton isn't tipping his hat to classic western movies, he borrows blatantly from blaxploitation thrillers of the 1970s. For example, he introduces lead character Mark Wahlberg with the Marvin Gaye title tune from Ivan Dixon's blaxploitation actioneer "Trouble Man" (1972) starring Robert Hooks. At the same time, "Four Brothers" takes the idea of black and white foster brothers a step farther than the Wesley Snipes &amp; Woody Harrelson thriller "Money Train" (1995) where Snipes and Harrelson played foster brothers competing for the attention of hot Hispanic actress Jennifer Lopez. Action-oriented moviegoers who prefer their melodramas loaded with bursts of staccato gunfire and ghetto profanity as well as careening auto chases will have a field day with this trigger-happy tough guy twaddle. A feisty, unshaven Wahlberg puts on a tougher act than usual as a revenge hungry hothead in need of anger management, while Tyrese Gibson struggles as much with the bad guys as he does with his fiery Latino girlfriend. If "Boyz N the Hood" and "Baby Boy" rank as Singleton's better movies, "Four Brothers" falls somewhere between the above-average but flawed "Shaft" (2000) with Samuel L. Jackson and hare-brained hokum like last summer's "2 Fast 2 Furious" with Paul Walker.Scenarists David ("The Watcher") Elliot and first-timer Paul Lovett have cooked up a cliché-ridden but brutal mystery thriller that definitely needed a few more rewrites when you consider how lame some crucial scenes turn out. One major scene near the end about a corrupt cop unravels because the surprise reversal is simply too preposterous. Meanwhile, Elliot and Lovett have clearly appropriated the idea of four brothers getting to the bottom of the death of their mother from "The Sons of Katie Elder," but most of the action resembles a blaxploitation shoot'em up with everybody but the heroes brandishing submachine guns. The action opens on a snowy evening in a corner grocery store where two thugs in woolen ski masks rob and murder an unarmed cashier then blast to bits an old woman, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan of "Tears of the Sun"), at close range with an automatic shotgun. Naturally, everybody is stunned by this senseless violence, because Evelyn was the neighborhood do-gooder. As one cop explains to another during a moment of obvious exposition, Evelyn emerged as the patron saint of the inner city and rescued droves of at-risk delinquent children from lives of crimes. She found over 100 foster homes for these social misfits. When Evelyn couldn't find homes for Bobby (Mark Wahlberg of "Boogie Nights"), Angel (Tyrese Gibson of "Baby Boy"), Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund of "Troy") and Jeremiah Mercer (Andre Benjamin, better known as the lead singer for the hip-hop group Outkast), she raised them as her own. Jeremiah Mercer was the only brother who stayed behind in Detroit while rebellious Bobby went off and served time; Jack became a musician, and Angel joined the U.S. Marines. The Detroit detectives on the case, Lt. Green (Terrence Howard of "Hustle &amp; Flow") and Sgt. Fowler (Josh Charles of "Dead Poet's Society), believe that Evelyn died, because she wound up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Before the gunfire wanes and the blood coagulates, our eight-fisted heroes discover that her brutal killing was less spontaneous than the police say.African-American director John Singleton stages a fairly intense gun battle between an army of masked assassins and our protagonists when the latter are chilling at Evelyn's house. The only drawback to an otherwise blistering bullet ballet is that the henchmen waste their ammunition. They practically destroy the house, but they cannot hit anybody on the premises. When the Detroit Police finally arrive late as always, Lt. Green surveys the carnage and lets our heroes off far too easily, casually dismissing everything as 'self-defense.' Mind you, "Four Brothers" never wears out its welcome, thanks to its fast pace, gritty dialogue, and shoot first, ask questions later approach. The thing that made the John Wayne &amp; Dean Martin opus "The Sons of Katie Elder" so memorable was that the villains kept crowding the Elders into one corner after another that the heroes found steadily harder to escape. Things kept getting more precarious for John Wayne and Dean Martin, so they had to think their way out of danger. The Elders spent most of their time fighting on defense. The heroes in "Four Brothers" have things a lot easier, striking more often on the offensive against the villains, though one of the four bites the asphalt before fade-out. Nonetheless, they never wind up as badly behind the 8-ball or as desperate for help as the brothers in "The Sons of Katie Elder." Moreover, while the heroes in "The Sons of Katie Elder" treated violence as a last resort, the "Four Brothers" adopt violence as the first resort. Literally, they fight fire with fire and show little reluctance to abide by the law. Neither the city of Detroit nor the Detroit Police Department catch a break, especially in the last scene when our heroes survive the beatings at the hands of the cops in the interrogation rooms. Despite a strong cast, invigorating action scenes and confined social commentary about saving the inner-city from drug dealers, "Four Brothers" suffers from far too many lapses in logic to qualify as anything more than an adequate way to alleviate an hour and forty-eight minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night, and let me say, it was bad. The villain "victor sweet" has moments in the film that do not even seem to make sense in any way, one second he is making people eat off the floor, and then he has kids eating ice cream in his house, and then all his "peeps" turn on him. This makes no sense. The bad guy in this was laughable at best, and the effort by singleton to make his appear "bad" are horrid efforts in film-making. The brothers themselves are as believable as unicorns. We have Wahlberg, who may be able to pass off as a black guy, he really tries, but then we have the white punk rocker who grew up in Detroit and acts more like a woman in the movie than a bad ass. I was happy when he got killed because he was like a square peg in a round hole. Outcast guy was decent as an actor, making him a bad ass in the film however, was laughable. In one scene he hits Tyrese w/ the force of a 4 yr old girl and tyrese stumbles back like 10 feet. I laughed at that, in real life tyrese would have stood there and then punched outcast dude's face in. The plot of this movie is laughable as well. I mean, your left wondering, what is the point of this? The scenes with the mom in ghost form connecting w/ each boy was also laughable. It was like singleton just threw in a bunch of people and said, act like a family, but at the same time share not one trait in common. I mean, it was bad. Tyrese Gibson is not very convincing as a tough guy. In fact, only Wahlberg is. Wahlberg is the only guy in this film that exudes even a small hint of masculinity. This movie is more about racial mixing then anything else. In fact, I didn't even like the mom in the movie, she struck me as fake and culpable. She looked more like a crazy hag who eats children at the thanksgiving dinner scene then the caring mom. And for 4 uh, "brothers" to seem to share not one thing in common is a mistake on singleton's part. The fact is, 4 brothers fails in its attempt to convey a sense of togetherness amongst blacks and whites. That was the main point, and it failed miserably in my estimation. Further, Hollywood really needs to develop black actors more. They are typecast all the time as "caring gangsters". I mean the cop in this film, the dude from "hustle and flow", he is a superb actor, yet every film he is in has to do w/ race. Let blacks do some films that aren't about race for crying out loud. The race factor has been beat into the face of every American for the last 30 years of black acting. OK, we get it, you suffer from racism, but expand your horizons! Let the Denzel in you come out! The guy who plays victor sweet was horrible, he was OK in "serenity" but again, typecast as a black gangster, his character was poor, he didn't look like "killer dog" he looked like a pesty child who needed to just be spanked. Annoying character development. I mean one more race thing here, singleton even allowed Wahlberg to call a sort of bad back guy a "house ni$%er" this is from the movie folks! Not me! I mean, that is a lame attempt to make Wahlberg look like he "fits in w/ the black crowd" please. That wasn't needed, and it offended me because it was contrived.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Script More Restless Than Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Someone had a good idea when they thought up the premise for FOUR BROTHERS: Four tough guys return to their home town in search of answers concerning their mother's sudden death. It made a good trailer, sure enough. But something happened along the way that turned a good premise into two hours of complete confusion. It's hard to know where to begin. The actors are all first rate and there is certainly some chemistry on screen. But what they're doing, where they're going, none of this makes a lot of sense. I found myself often trying to figure out a scene - is this a comic moment, or is it supposed to be suspenseful? Are the characters acting irrationally, or are they supposed to be this thoughtless? There is rarely any logic to the storytelling that I can determine, and the film stumbles into a series of random events more than I care to recall. Perhaps there's fault in the editing (there are three editors listed - why three?), but it's hard to tell where it went wrong. Even worse are those moments where I found myself thinking "oh, he's not really going to do that, is he?"...immediately followed by the character doing what I thought no well written character would possibly do. At the convenience of the wafer thin plot, characters seem to lose all rational thought, and then moments later regain it. This kind of writing never plays like the reality director John Singleton seems to want us to buy into. I think he's got a lot of talent, but he needs to find better scripts, and better ways to execute them. Even the action sequences are below standard, and only surprising because they are so nonsensical.I wanted to like this one, but there's just too much frustration in the viewing, and I'll have to think twice before checking out Singleton's next film; this one is just plain bad. 3 out of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits The titular four brothers return to their hometown to attend the funeral of their mother, who was gunned down in a liquor store hold-up. And, after a bit of alpha-male bonding (mainly involving the appropriately aggressive sport of ice hockey!) and re-acquainting, they set out to avenge her. But, as they go on their vengeful quest, twists and turns emerge that make their mission not as straight-forward as they suspected."They came to bury their mother...and her killer" the tagline blurts (one of the best revenge taglines ever, actually.) And that is moreorless the plot line. Four Brothers is yet another American revenge movie that have been popping relentlessly out the cookie-cutter machine since 9/11, showing the air of vengeance still rife some years after those tragic events.But it's flawed from the off-set. From the start, it's just preposterous to believe that some kindly, old-fashioned old white lady could turn so many lives around in a foul-mouthed, predominantly black area without having been robbed or blasted away long before she did at the beginning of the film. And secondly, the brothers one dimensional revenge feelings leave the film a little cold. Do they feel no guilt after having moved away and left her to cope for herself for so many years before her tragic end? No, they just wanna go pop a cap in da ass of the mother******* who did it straight-out. And for a cold tale of revenge like this, they're too jokey and light-hearted about it all, constantly blurting out wise-cracks and getting into silly situations, unbalancing the tone of the film unacceptably.As for the cast, as the leading brother, Mark Wahlberg is on fairly good form, doing some funny impressions in his light-hearted scenes, fairly moving in the film's more emotional ones, and Tyrese Gibson is in fare a notch above 2 Fast 2 Furious and there's pretty good support from Garrett Hedlund and Andre Benjamin (even if, altogether, they kept reminding me weirdly of the four Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, with the old lady as Splinter.) Early on, director John Singleton seems to be aiming for some kind of art house feel as Wahlberg drives to the funeral, but he ditches this pretty early on and we're left with the film we have.But above all, I just couldn't get over what an incredibly boring experience I found the film to be, with large segments just dragging by and failing to engage, not to mention the plot being a little too complicated for a film of it's kind. Some good points, but mostly just a very forgettable experience. **</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An embarrassing nonsense of a movie harking back to old 80s video action flicks... Best avoided...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hark back to the halcyon days of the 80s when videos were all the rage, and those action movies that used to crowd the shelves, and only then will you get an idea of what Four Brothers is like. 20 years ago this would have starred Stallone or Chuck Norris, but now it is Mark Wahlberg, who is just as cringingly bad in this movie. Essentially, this film should have been about a family of four brothers who are out to investigate how their mother was killed, but for marketing reasons they lumped two white actors with two black actors together with the notion that they were all adopted etc etc in a ham fisted fashion to create a full storyline. Mark Wahlberg though out of the lot does a poor embarrassing impression of being from the streets in NY. Humour is poor and badly executed, whilst the characters are hardly developed.Storyline borders on the insane, and is as ridiculous as you can get. It will though still find its audience, and even if you wish to watch it, I'd recommend you just to wait and save your pennies as it will find itself being a general TV gap filler on a Tuesday late night spot in a couple of years time. A travesty of a movie, avoid?..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>lackluster, implausible crime drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Brothers" is yet another nail in the coffin of John Singleton's increasingly moribund movie-making career. The director - who burst upon the scene in 1991 with the vibrant and gritty "Boyz n the Hood" - has here mounted a film so burdened by implausibility and contrivance that it makes one wonder if the once-promising filmmaker will ever be able to get back on track again. The story, reeking of artificiality, features Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund as four troubled young men raised by the same foster mother. When she is killed in a convenience store robbery, the quartet launches into action, seeking revenge against the perpetrators and becoming slowly convinced, through their investigation in the neighborhood, that the killing might not have been as random in nature as they had been initially led to believe.The main weakness of this film is that it gives us virtually no reason to care about any of the characters. By not showing us any scenes between the boys and their foster mother (except for one embarrassingly bad Thanksgiving dinner fantasy sequence that looks as if it were conceived by a first-year film student), we are forced to take their relationship totally on faith, rendering the boys' thirst for revenge arbitrary at worst and academic at best.The acting is uniformly flat, with the characters little more than wafer-thin stereotypes, and even the action scenes come across as surprisingly mundane and second-rate given the Singleton pedigree in this area. The boys' running around from venue to venue in their Detroit neighborhood, brandishing guns in full view of the populace and screaming for information about their mother's killer, is ludicrous on the face of it and often reduces the film to the level of cheap low comedy burlesque.With nary a single moment that rings believable or true, "Four Brothers" is by-the-book film-making from a director who has proved that he has the wherewithal and talent to do so much more.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I read good reviews of this film prior to viewing and was left terribly disappointed. It ranged from Cheese verging on the ridiculous (round the table scene). The film was dressed up as a touching revenge action thriller but lacked grit and reality. As if the cops would let you go after a gunfight where half a dozen gangsters get killed, Police say defending your home thats fine boys carry on.For me it really lacked the touch that some of Singletons previous work had, the cast were OK. Andre 3000 looks to have natural potential with good screen presence. Marky Mark's lead was just average and lacked conviction in the part. On the whole it left me feeling like i'd wasted an hour an a half. Which is a shame because it could have been better.</fullReview>

Markie Mark was wasn't at his best I'll leave it at that. Although Andre 3000 was the only highlight of the movie, I was impressed that he could act and he was the only one that held this movie afloat. The filming wasn't well done at all.

		<fullReview>I don't usually bother reviewing movies unless I feel something needs to be said. This movie looked decent from the previews and I'm always up for taking a chance on a flick I don't know too much about; however, this shouldve been a path not taken. The plot was a mess of irrelevant dialogue and scenes strung together by a nonsensical story that could have easy been written by a twelve year-old with ADD. Seriously, one would hope that some factors could've salvaged this mediocre-at-best- movie, but not the action, actors, or even humor (what little there really was) did anything to improve it. In fact these things only dragged down this movie into deeper realms of film hell. In one scene (the brothers are looking for people who have information about their mothers death), Mark Whalberg busts into a crowded high-school basketball gym, throwing his gun around and screaming like a maniac. I mean sure, an action film can be unrealistic, but to ask me to swallow that garbage is unforgivableAs a final note, prior to this movie i can scarcely remember laughing at a movie, during the movie, due to how bad it was, i did numerous times</fullReview>

Andre 3000 did an O.K. job considering he has no formal acting background. I'd still rather see him making good music which he does very well. Marky Mark didn't shine too brightly either.

His kid brother played by Garrett Hedlund looks like he had a rancid burger a while back and still hasn't recovered. Andre 3000bc should stick to being an average musician and not try to be a below par actor. And as for the other one, Tyrese Gibson - he should go back to appearing on Moesha. The script is ludicrous, the dialogue laughable and in charge of this whole quagmire of idiocy is John Singleton who has directed a decent film since Boyz n the Hood. Honestly don't even bother.

		<fullReview>Did they ever reveal why the mother was killed? They kept saying it was a hit, but I don't think they ever said why someone put a hit on her. Also, her death totally did not look like a hit. It looked like two guys came in to rob a convenience store and she was shot because she was there and was a witness. It seemed like the two robbers didn't know she was actually in the store until she gasped after seeing them shoot the clerk. I don't want to go back and watch the movie again to find out because it was not a movie that I would go back and re-watch. I thought the movie was good until I realized that the plot did not make a whole lot of sense. Maybe they did reveal why there was a hit on her, but to me, the movie did not make it clear enough. Probably would not have paid much attention to the movie, while watching it, if not for Mark Wahlberg and Andre 3000.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Four Brothers" is a 108-minute movie from 10 years ago that was written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, bot not really that prolific, but they did a good job here. Same can be said about director James Singleton, only that he has made films for many years, also at this point already and scored 2 Oscar nominations for Boyz n the Hood back in the early 90s. And just like in that one, the cast in this film is predominantly black as well. However, there are exception such as Mark Wahlberg who plays the main character and the very young, truly unknown Garret Hedlund. Also in it are Tyrese Gibson, Chiwetel Ejiofor and André Benjamin. The latter is singer from the pretty great band Outkast. He certainly held his own very well here against all these professional actors, which is especially impressive as his character is actually one of the biggest and most significant of the movie.The plot is as follows: An old lady gets killed during a store robbery and her 4 sons are out for revenge. They run into good and bad cops and the main antagonist who is surrounded by many henchmen and contract killers. Oh yeah i forgot to mention Terrence Howard and Josh Charles ("The Good Wife") earlier. They also play their parts very well. Do not look for realism or real greatness in this movie. It's a nice revenge tale, but it's not too realistic. Still this wasn't a problem for me as it was mostly a fun watch with nice character elaborations and an interesting story. The ending may be a bit too over the top in terms of how everything looked bad for the title characters, but they manage apparently easily to get out of this mess. Really solid watch and I recommend this movie. Quite a lot of talent in here and that does not only include the cast. thumbs up.</fullReview>

The moral the merciless, yet comedic Mercer brothers is family over everything.The reason that their saint-of-a-woman mother adopted them is that no one else would. They were the worst behaved kids in the streets of the Detroit, which is saying something. When people who knew Miss Mercer heard about her death, people were shocked. As Jack, the youngest and most 'innocent' said, "Who would kill the sweetest old lady in the goddamn world?" All of the brothers felt like this. Bobby, the most bad ass, is seen crying in the bathroom the first night back in his childhood home with his brothers. They want revenge for the cold-blooded murder of their mother-at all costs.Four Brothers is a great movie. It consists of guns, death, tear-jerker moments, funny, yet vicious cast, and, best of all, revenge. It leaves you with the following emotions throughout the movie: ready to kill somebody, wanting to cry alone in a dark room, and/or laughing hysterically.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers (2005): Dir: John Singleton / Cast: Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, Garrett Hedlund, Terrence Howard: Family is the theme of this film although vengeance certainly plays a factor as four adopted brothers (two white, two black) return home for their mother's funeral after she was murdered during a robbery. They seek justice and vengeance setting out to solve the case themselves. Unfortunately revenge seems to be the norm yet the screenplay details their search and establishes the bond that unites them. Directed by John Singleton who often makes films about urban society with violent undertones as he did with Baby Boy and Boyz N the Hood. Mark Wahlberg heads the cast returning with a bad reputation and a taste for vengeance. Tyrese Gibson is superb as the brother involved with a feisty Spanish woman. Andre Benjamin is a family and business person. Garrett Hedlund plays the gay brother seeking refuge in music. Their anger is understandable and their desire for justice seems to be a never ending plea even in reality but when revenge plays a factor a film risks the wrong sort of entertainment delivery and warps any potential message. Other roles are standard issue from the investigating cops warning the boys, to the villain who will get pummeled in due time. In the end this film is well made but its take on revenge sidelines a bond between brothers. Score: 6 ? / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie sounded rather good when I read about it. I do like a good revenge movie. Unfortunately it did not exactly live up to expectations. This is more an amateur rampage than a planned attempt to find out who the culprit is and exact revenge. A good chunk of the movie is spent with the four brothers mouthing off at each other. Another good chunk is spent with them very amateurishly running around waving guns and "interrogating" people. Somehow, mostly by sheer luck, they actually manage to get closer to their goal. Even the good cop in the movie behaves as a bloody amateur when confronted with what he knows is a crooked cop and of course gets the short end of the stick for his efforts.As if the amateurish behavior of the four brothers was not annoying enough they have thrown in a hysterical, supposedly Italian, girlfriend who is dumber than a doornail and excruciatingly frustrating when she shows up shouting, screaming and generally tries to sabotage the brothers attempts to get anywhere.The only thing mildly intelligent and entertaining about this movie was the ending when the brothers confronted the crooked cop and the main bad guy. I have to say that I did not see that coming. Otherwise the movie was pretty null to me. Technically it had no problem. It was decent enough shot and the actors did a quite good job of the roles they were given. It fell down big time on the script however. At least for me.</fullReview>

There are some Missteps like the Basketball Game that comes off as Ludicrous. The Acting is Fine but the Latino Female Character and Her Constant Loud Mouth Yelling and Confrontations with the Brother are Grating and Over the Top.The Revenge Element is Handled with Reckless Abandon that Sometimes Works just Fine, Like the Scene in the Project with Attack Dogs and an Escape Attempt that is Bone Crushing. The Car Chase is Refreshingly Different, but Sometimes the Gun Wielding Swagger can be a Bit too Much to Take.Director John Singleton Seems to be on His Game here and is at Home with the Homeys. Mark Wahlberg doesn't Mumble Much but the Marbles in the Mouth are Evident in a Couple of Scenes. The Movie is an Above Average Character Study with Plenty of Action and a Goodly Amount of Thought.Overall a Winner for the Director and Wahlberg, but the Overrated Terrence Howard got most of the Awards and Critical Attention as a Cop with Connections to the Family. A Picture with a lot More Pathos than Most Movies of This Type. Uneven but Gritty and Violent Enough to Satisfy its Goal as a Deep Discussion on Environment and Noble Intentions Buried in a Storm of Chilling Reality.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mark Wahlberg in tough Detroit area leads his brothers in finding their's mom's assassin</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well-filmed and well-acted, "Four Brothers" tells an inventive tale. The four brothers were all adopted by one mom, and she has been killed in a convenience store holdup. She spent her life with neighborhood youths, helping them to avoid delinquency and crime. The brothers, now young men, re-assemble with the idea of finding her murderers. The cops, after all, are not much good at that. Their search leads to a web of corruption and gang control.The four brothers are sketched well. They have an interesting feature, which is one foot in violent action, but not crime, and another foot in the social ways taught to them by their mother. Consequently, their methods of finding out what happened to their mother and remedying it are unorthodox. Seeing them and their methods is what makes the film interesting and creates most of its action.The film makes good use of snow in Detroit, and there is one car chase sequence in snow that is well done.I would rate this about 6.5 if I could. It's a good and entertaining action-crime film, a little bit different than the usual because of the family aspects and the depictions of the four brothers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Somewhat entertaining but oversimplified</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie I had high expectations for this movie. Especially since I thought the premise of four brothers coming together to take care of a certain cause. Mainly because the mother of the four adopted sons mother got murdered. Which happens in the trailer and the beginning of the movie. I just really didn't really like the direction and character acting in this movie. I especially didn't like the direction of the dialogue, it seemed like it was trying too hard to sound to sound tough and cool. This may work in certain movies but it just doesn't really work in this one. Even the four brothers who use to be degenerates seemed like it was planned and not genuine, even the bond between the brothers seemed fake. In fact everything about this movie seemed forced. Even the different backgrounds between the four brothers didn't seem all that believable like it's there to just make the movie seem fresh. Which is fine, but it wasn't all that believable with the four degenerates. The most unbelievable part is how the some of the four brothers tries to act all hood they just didn't seem all that intimidating, yeah they found a new direction in life because of their mother. But the task they are trying to do, they just didn't seem all that intimidating. The characters are somewhat entertaining but not that believable. For a movie like this it would have been better if it was more dirty and gritty. Movies don't have to be realistic or believable to be entertaining, but for a movie like this it would have been better if it did go in that direction. The character decisions in some scenes were pretty stupid also. This movie really is one dimensional in a lot of ways, but some aspects of it was entertaining.6.4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Sons of Mother Mercer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When Angelic Mother Mercer is shot dead during a liquor store hold-up, her four adopted sons go hunting for the perps and uncover small town corruption in this contemporary western, inspired by The Sons of Katie Elder. It's all a bit daft and looks very cheap, even by Singleton's lo-fi standards. But this being Singleton (that rare breed of indie director who refuses to be bought) there's some good social commentary to be found among the flying bullets and boo-hiss villains - most obviously, the fact that that modern families may not be exclusively comprised of one race anymore. Great soundtrack too, including Marvin Gaye and The Temptations, and cheerfully gung-ho performances from the attractive leads - even if Marky Mark these days resembles a pork scratching that's been left out in the rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plagued by Singleton's usual storytelling problems, not as good as I hoped, but better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton drives me crazy. He has a gift for creating interesting and "cool" protagonists, compelling plot ideas, and immersive atmospheres in his films. But he just doesn't seem to be able to tell a story that doesn't trip on its own shoelaces at some point as it dashes for the finish line. If he ever gets it right, he may well come up with a movie for the ages, instead of the interesting but flawed spectacles that he is known for (his most famous film, "Boyz.." is powerful but not "great".) This is still the case for "4 Brothers". It has some very powerful moments, and scenes that may stick in your memory for many years to come. However, the viewer should go to see for those moments and enjoy them as they happen, and not think too much about the overall worth of the story being told. The screenplay starts out with an interesting, gritty idea for an urban drama, featuring four anti-hero protagonists with a strong ensemble chemistry. But about 1/3 of the way in, the screenplay rides off into Cloud Cuckoo Land and starts throwing so many extra elements into the mix that the results just don't hang together. And at some point, the "Oh suuuuure" factor simply becomes too much. Some examples: At one point, brother "Bobby" disrupts a basketball game at a community center by pulling a pistol out at center court and threatening the teams and the crowd with it. The ostensible reason for this is to flush out a runner or a witness who they can track to their quarry. And it works. But there are NO consequences for pulling this stunt, which should have been a 3rd degree felony at the very least, and should have brought the police down on the brothers like a hammer on rye toast. Another example: One of the brothers ("Angel") resumes a relationship with an old flame as soon as he comes back to town, and the girl ends up virtually living in his bedroom over the course of the next few days. (As Shaft said in Singleton's previous film,"You've got to pay your duty to that booty."") This is all well and good, and is meant to flesh out the character as a complete person and not just a vengeance driven stereotype...but literally every scene involving this girlfriend drags on with cheesy sitcom humor that stops the movie dead. And again, the "Oh Suuuure" factor pops up: Angel and his brothers are on their way out the door to pursue an urgent hot lead to their mother's murder, and the girlfriend wastes 40 seconds of screen time complaining about the meal she spent two hours cooking while Angel tries to placate her. It's supposed to be funny, but it isn't. You can't believe for a second that Angel wouldn't quash that noise with a curt reply about what his REAL priorities were, or that the girlfriend would be so shallow that she wouldn't realize what was at stake.Another problem: the film can't decide whether to pay attention to the police efforts or not. In the beginning, it appears that the police aren't going to be effective in their efforts, and the two actors playing the investigative team just seem to be doing walk-on roles. Then the black member of the team gets some screen time as things heat up, and it appears as if he may play an important role, his partner shoots him, and he dies. There just wasn't enough screen time spent establishing the cops as sympathetic characters or otherwise before the shocking murder takes place. Just as we start to know and like the character, he gets shot dead. Problem numero four: more than halfway into the movie, the investigation proceeds leads to figure behind the murder, a gangster on the rise called Victor Sweet, and then the movie proceeds to spend a LOOOONG scene that shows Sweet is a sinister, sadistic creep who rules by humiliating and dominating his men. And "Oh Suuuuure" factor pops up again when Sweet goes out of his way to humiliate a loyal lieutenant by promising to cuckold him with his new wife. It's a nasty, glib scenario and is guaranteed to rankle the sensibilities of anyone watching. (I don't blame the actor for this, though - I think he was giving the performance the director wanted.) And these are just the flaws I thought of in 30 seconds. The whole 2nd half of the film is like this, with false notes and miscues jarring the viewers' suspension of disbelief and irritating his desire for an integrated, seamless story. If not for the performances, cinematography and soundtrack, you'd be really irritated at the careless scripting going on here. It sounds as if I hate this movie. But really, I don't. All the actors are good-to-great, even Mark Wahlberg, whose continued career success is mostly inexplicable to me. As I've said previously, there are lots of powerful moments, well staged gunfights and visceral fistfights, and clever dialog and witty byplay. I pick on the film's problems because there is so much here to like, and yet the viewer has to keep turning his or her brain off to keep the story from annoying him to distraction. It's a good film that could have been a GREAT film if only Singleton would learn to keep his films a little simpler and a little more consistent.Singleton apparently has three films in the pipe after "4 Brothers"...it's entirely possible that wiser collaborators may get him to calm down a bit and help his storytelling gifts gel better. I certainly hope so. But in the meantime, I'll continue to go see Singleton's movies for the definite pleasures they provide.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Movie I've seen all Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I have no doubts in my mind this is the best movie of 2005, and on of the best I've ever seen. One thing I really like the fact that you know Evelyn Mercer dies going into the film. In almost every commercial I saw it pretty much showed her getting shot. That really helps the movie hit the ground running, and if not for that fact they couldn't make any of the rest of the movie worth watching. Another thing is that they didn't use actors that are way over-publicized and you see in just about every other film, although I know that Mark Wahlburg is getting pretty famous. And, although I have misgivings about some people famous for their music acting, Andre' Benjamin actually does a good job as Jerry. The best thing though is how they make the brothers' relationships so believable in what, admittedly, a pretty unbelievable situation. And if you like this movie check out 'the Boondock Saints', and if you're a Mark Wahlberg fan see the movie 'Three Kings'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!! Both times I saw it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie!! It was moving and emotionally sound. I nearly cried when they were all at the kitchen table, I know I warned a spoiler but you have to watch the movie if you want to know what I'm talking about! However I noticed how very closely it resembled "The Son's of Katie Elder".I was wondering why no credit was given when it is obvious to me anyway that it was nearly the very same movie save for a few differences in the back story. Ultimately while watching this film I was curious as to how they were going to handle the different twists and turns that were offered in the old John Wayne flick, and was pleased each and every time I was shown the way.Either which way I loved the movie it was well crafted, remake or not!If you liked this movie and have not yet seen "The Son's of Katie Elder" then by all means go get it today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>4 Brothers - Better Than Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Saw adverts and posters and expected it to be another loud shoot em up with lots of blood and loads of cheesy lines. But it was quite the opposite, despite a quite terrible dinner scene with some slightly cheesy flashbacks this film still performed very well.You actually felt for the brothers, and also when they shot the killers it was like i was worried for Fairy which was kind off weird. But the comedy part was god, not to overdone but not so there's nothing to laugh about, and it was great seeing each of the brothers fight and have a good time. Also the gun scenes although on occasions were a little overdone and at times you did wonder if they knew how to aim they were still entertaining and again they never really went to far.The actual story was alright nothing revolutionary, not by along way but something in which the film could follow easily and so can the audience. And the slight twists here and their really did make this a film which i though i was going to hate into a film i would gladly watch again</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Old fashioned Revenge Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film takes me back to the eighties, sitting on my living room settee watching some cop film in the dark, enthralled by the drama.The good guys in this film aren't exactly good, but that is easily brushed over. It's about revenge after all...It is at times predictable, but none-the-less a fine piece of action drama, stylish, with some good old fashioned themes, about loyalty, revenge, humour, love, respect. The four lead characters could have done with a bit of background, I would have loved to have seen how their 'Mom' gathered them together, worked her magic.Think the soundtrack and some solid performances make this action film worth every penny.I enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather disappointing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Their are numerous problems to this movie, which I was dragged to just because Walhberg was in it, that make this film just a waste of money in my opinion.First off, if you have wasted time playing the GTA game series, you have no need to watch this movie, the scripts are shockingly similar. Characters matched up, lines matched up, the ever popular drive-by's, and corruption all lined up. Secondly, the story, while having many twists and turns, left a lot of plot-holes. Many times I found myself confused by their(the 4 brothers) logic because their was basically no logic to it; how they handled different situations, how they handled receiving information, all of it never made any sense to me. Third, I couldn't help but think every character in the movie was an idiot. I would sometimes mutter "moron" or "idiot" and I feel that everyone around me agreed. And just to add, the sense of ruthlessness portrayed by every character(except for the ones that die?) makes me pity how violent our society is.On a lighter side, the movie did have a lot of twists that did keep me wondering the whole time, but it didn't keep me on the edge of my seat because everyone is able to predict exactly what happens about a minute before it happens. Their were the occasional fights that I found entertaining and kept me awake and who doesn't love a good ole gun fight.To wrap this up, i would say the movie was overly violent, plagiarized, and discriminating(wow, now i wonder, where do stereotypes come from?), but it did have a small bit of humor here and their, and the plot turns and ideas played out by different characters did make it interesting. Overall, I wouldn't suggest it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brothers does entertain, given crap in between.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So what happens when your mother dies? You probably see her funeral and then only remember her in pictures. Well this lady died a little differently, executed for you out there. "Four Brothers" is a pretty good film, which delivers the necessary punch of the day if that's what you desire. I'm not sure what the racial hand pulls out, but I'm sure it doesn't put anything back. You've got the four brothers, Marky Mark actually has personality in this one! By God! John Singleton basically has made dick since making his last good film in 1992. Pretty sad when you think about it, sure this was a good film to get going with but 13 years? Basically the story is simple, and it unfolds that way. The Brothers use harsh tactics to get what they want! They eventually find out who was responsible for it, and they kill him! There is a good gun fight in this film, which was a nice view after seeing a bunch of baby crap. The death of the brother was to add value to the kill, and really did nothing to it, because they had an idiotic boxing competition which seemed like they were trying to eat a steak and bone a chick at the same time. Corny as crap after corn.The overall lesson I did learn from his film was to kill if someone is killed that you love. Marky Mark was cussing and was trying to act cool throughout the film. Surprisingly, he wasn't just in the background as he is in EVERY single film he has ever starred. Even when he pulled out the big wiener in Boogie Nights, it was a fake just like him.Four Brothers is a good flick for the night. I had a good time, and enjoyed a little vengeance through means of killing. 2005 has been okay, and I find this to be a surprise, being actually worth the money I spent on it! Transporter 2 you say? Bring it on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Male bonding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anybody who goes to American movies knows if you enter a convenience store somebody's going to get shot. "Four Brothers" begins with a lovable old lady called Evelyn Mercer (Fionulla Flanagan) meeting that fate. Well, it turns out sweet little Evelyn was foster mom for four tough guys who were so mean as kids she was the only person willing to take them on. They may be less than model citizens now, but they'd probably not even be alive if it hadn't been for Evelyn Mercer. So when the Mercer boys -- Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and young Jack (Garrett Hedlund), who're white, and Angel (Tyrese Gibson) and Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) who're black -- all come back together for the funeral and get hints that Evelyn was deliberately assassinated and not just caught in the crossfire, they go into action. When one of the brothers may have had involvement in the hit, the plot and the emotions get more complicated.Once again as in James Gray's richly atmospheric and brooding and admittedly far superior 2000 movie "The Yards," Mark Wahlberg stars in a story about a doomed gangsterish family whose sins he tries to unearth and cleanse. The special charm of the male bonding is in the multi-racial brotherhood, which Singleton and the actors manage to inject a lot of warmth into. These guys are soulful, whether black or white. Not only is the sound track rich in Motown classics, but the brothers cry a lot.There are conscious allusions to "Mystic River" with its deep bonds, buried traumas, childhood street hockey games, and clapboard houses -- though this is Detroit, not Massachusetts. The sense of place, in fact, may waver; but the memories and loyalty don't. It's Thanksgiving, and the men stay at the old house, where the memories start the tears flowing. A turkey is baked and drinks are poured but the brothers aren't hungry. Bobby gets them to go out and play hockey.Next day a little investigation brings on the suspicions of a contract hit against their foster mom. Though Jeremiah objects, Bobby remains in charge. Jerry's relative respectability does not convey any influence in this family; his hesitancy about revenge already makes him seem disloyal. Right away at least three, and sometimes four, of the Mercer boys are in full attack mode and before you can say "assault weapon," the screen is littered with the bodies of cheap gangsters, crooked cops, and gangster politicos. "Hell, this is Detroit," somebody insists. Heads are smashed and weapons multiply, falling into the brothers' hands by the trunk load. Two detectives are watching all this -- one of them played by Terrence Howard, who's so great in "Hustle and Flow" -- and as in another better movie, Joe Carnahan's 2002 "Narc," an element of corruption and betrayal comes in from that angle as well.Jeremiah claimed his reluctance to participate had moral and filial grounds: he said blood revenge was the last thing Evelyn would have wanted her death to bring about. But you wouldn't have been reading the movie very well if you thought he was the one we must listen to. Before long rumors link him with some insurance and a payoff that put his loyalty in doubt. But is he really a rotten apple, or just a bad businessmen? Suspicion falls inside and outside the family. Don't worry, if you're going to see "Four Brothers," reading this review won't spoil it for you. I'm not going to tell you what the movie's secrets are. Hell, they were so twisted, I'm not sure I really understood them anyway. But this is an urban thriller, or if you like a ghetto western, and the procedural details aren't what it's about. It's about emotion, it's about action, it's about getting the bad guys. And the worst bad guy gets his comeuppance starkly and satisfyingly out on a sheet of ice. It's a nice detail that his gangster crew revolt because trade union experience makes them realize he's an abusive employer. Of course he's worse than that. He's a sadistic creep.The critics are right: this isn't a great movie. At moments it's not even a very good one. The chief villain's a little too villainous. The Nigerian-descent English actor Chiwetel Ejiofor (of Stephen Frears's 2002 "Dirty Pretty Things"), who plays him, is out of his element (maybe he took the role for a change of pace). The plot's too tangled. The cops are too complicit, even for Detroit.Still, there's something that's underlyingly okay about "Four Brothers." Singleton is returning to the roots of his film-making, the ghetto and its destructive effects on young black men, which he memorably depicted in his 1991 "Boyz N the Hood." Mark Wahlberg's presence here feels right. Everybody's having a good time, which is something that should happen more often. There's nothing wrong with a dose of warm interracial male bonding, with tears and shootouts, every now and again. It can get you through a slow day. Unlike Cinderella Man's, this movies' snow looks pretty real. So do the women's ample cleavage. The movie's action is not convincing, but the atmosphere and people often are. There are a hell of a lot of weapons and gunshots in this movie, and a house gets turned into Swiss cheese like in the shootouts in "L.A. Confidential" and "Mr. and Mrs. Smith." "Four Brothers" is as lurid as the first and as fantastic as the second; but it still hurts when one of the brothers is lost, even if he goes with a sweet smile on his face.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, clichéd tripe.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just finished watching Four Brothers on the strength of reviews submitted on this site, which turned out to be a big mistake. The main protagonists, the four brothers of the title, are played with varying degrees of ineptitude by a cast of incompetents and failed musicians. Well one failed musician, Marky Mark, and the inexplicably popular, yet dire, André Benjamin. (Roses really smell like poo. Such wit). The names of said incompetents elude me and I lack the will necessary for the quick peruse of the internet research demands, so I had better get on with the review proper. The film. Oh my God the film. The film is so dull even writing this review is making me yawn like a Homer in church, so hear is quick list of my problems with the picture. The "plot" revolves around four adopted brothers' attempts to discover the killer or killers of their adoptive mother. Of course this being a gritty "street" drama the brothers are predictably a mixed race bunch. "Nothing wrong with that," I hear you cry and in reality you would be right but in this film, it just screams of cliché. At, or very near the beginning of the film, two policemen discuss the brothers, saying they would be pure evil if it hadn't been for their mother. I feel the director/writer was attempting to put in place some moral reasoning for the ensuing violence, in an obviously transparent manner. If the viewer has no objections to being patronized to, then all well and good, but I do. Following hot on the heels of this awful scene the four "brothers" (yes the quotation marks are deliberate), are to be found sitting at a dinner table, staring into space and one at a time, seeing their mother talk to them. A procession of clichéd memories and speeches from the mother had me reaching for, not the sick bag as many would assume, but a tissue to wipe my eyes as I was laughing so hard. Utterly ridiculous.The rest of the movie consists of the usual car chases, beatings, hackneyed gangsters and moralized murder one would expect from such a turgid and utterly appalling outing and I hope to never see it again. I frankly can't be bothered to write a more detailed analysis of the remainder as I fear further thought of the film would cause my brain would melt from my eyes. In the tradition of IMDb, if you liked this film you'll probably like The X factor. I think that last sentence pretty much sums it up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In this day and age of Hollywood remakes, it good to see new story lines come out. While the concept of revenging the death of a loved one has been used and used again, this movie puts a new spin to the concept.Good - Original concept Bad - Can't make up it's mind whether or not it wants to be a rough and tough or touchy feely family movie Supposedly the 4 adopted sons have learned how to be better citizens with the support of their mother. However, the 4 only show respect to each other, not the public. I guess the mother must have failed.The story is unbelievable and only works in a script - there are plot holes big enough to drive trucks through that the director expects the audience to accept at face value. The twist at the end is truly unbelievable; while I won't give the details, let's just say that $400,000 isn't enough money to buy the outcome.Character development is nonexistent and many of the scenes contain ridiculous and extreme violence that insults your intelligence. Multiple machine guns vs. a single shotgun and handgun. Guess who prevails? (roll eyes)To wrap things up, this movie had plenty of promise but poor writing, acting and directing. Keep the kids away from this stinker as violence is extreme and foul language is excessive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't spoil the movie by saying what made me give it a 9 instead of a 10 but I will say I makes you pull for the brothers even more. In fact what happens doesn't make the movie bad at all, some might say it's part of what makes it good and they could be right but you'll have to decide on your own. All that aside this movie was excellent. My heart pounds even now just writing about it. If you love action movies this is definitely a treat. The brothers relationship is touching, funny and completely convincing which is an important element that makes the movie so good. The 4 actors were well chosen for the parts and each character is distinctly different. You'll like all 4 of them for different reasons. Mark Wahlberg is great in this. His best yet and the other 3 actors, still fairly new to the big screen, hold their own. Well worth your money! Go see it and then when the DVD comes out buy it. This movie should definitely be added to anyones collection of great action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll try and get straight to the point... This movie has one of the best car chases in recent memory, mostly because it takes place in the snow. I'm sure there have been plenty of car chases in crappy weather but this one was done fantastically. There is also an intense gun fight that will make any antigun/progun nut salvate. Check your ideologies at the door and just sit back and enjoy the ride. Benjamin Andree "3000" surprised me with his acting skills. There's maybe one or two scenes that struck me as a bit too much overacting (not necessarily by Andree) but the action and strong characters are enough to overshadow that. This movie has a little bit of everything that everyone can love. Older women will love the whole attachment to the mother deal and younger women will drool over Mark Wahlberg, Andree, etc (don't deny it... you girls know that's the only reason you have any interest in this movie). And guys, this is just a kick @$$ flick that you'll run to the stores to pick up as soon as it hits DVD... but don't wait, cuz it's definitely worth watching on the big screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The beginning tells it all, the Paramount mountain engulfed in snow. The Motown soundtrack. This is not going to be your typical Hollywood action movie. This is raw shoot'em up urban action. Where the bad guys are really bad, and the good still bad. The characters are well drawn out and fun to watch. The laughs keep coming. If you're just in for the action, then the gripping action scenes will have you satisfied. And if you're a film nerd like myself, you'll appreciate the crisp cinematography and seamless editing. I can't believe this is the same Singleton director that just recently did the CG infested, cheesy "2 Fast 2 Furious". It seems like the only thing that survived off this bad spell is Tyrese's girlfriend, whose scenes are the most cliché and unnecessary ones. Still everything else is pure fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm a girl who likes action movies. And while this movie has great action it also has great acting, which is something most directors of action films tend to forget about these days. I will admit that it is sometimes hard during the action sequences to tell who's who, but this only happens once and I think it's mostly due to the snow in the scene. And some parts of it are a little predictable. For instance, about the time the movie started, I knew there weren't going to be four brothers at the end and in about fifteen minutes I had figured out which one was going to get it. That being said, their investigations into their mother's death takes some interesting and unexpected turns that makes up for the rest of the predictability of the film. The film shows the good and bad on both sides of the law. It's well written with that perfect blend of drama, comedy (many of the scenes between the brothers are hilarious), and action. It is definitely the best gritty action flick to hit theatres this summer and more than worth the price of admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie about revenge, hate and eventually... love.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very good movie about four brothers who battle against those who may or may not have plotted their adoptive mother's murder. Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Andre Benjamin and Tyrese Gibson are flawless playing the adopted Mercer brothers in this movie, they play off each other like they're real brothers; it's amazing to watch. Although Benjamin is cautious about joining his brothers in their "quest" for justice, another tragedy brings them all together again. The acting is incredibly real and raw, making it hard to believe that these characters are not who the actors actually are in real life. I deducted one point for the endearing, but kind of creepy chats the brothers have with their dead mother... It didn't really fit into the rest of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much more than just an action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, there is action. Yes, there is violence. Yes, there is a car chase. You would expect all those from "Four Brothers" in a "revenge film". What I didn't expect to experience, was the depth of emotion they evoked in me. They were beyond believable characters. I have met brothers like them, who treat each other in ways portrayed on screen.Even though "Momma" is killed early in the film, she is a very strong character who's presence is commanding. "Entering Momma's House", "Unpacking in Momma's House", "Thanksgiving Dinner", and the closing scene are all about the deep love and respect these four men have for their recently departed mother.I think men will enjoy this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way brothers should act.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I went to see this movie last night, and walking out of the theater I told myself I wanted to see it again very soon. There are unexpected scenes in this movie that made me laugh so hard my nose blew my slurpy back in the cup (I did not finish the slurpy after that). The chemistry that all 4 of the brothers had on screen was unmatched. To be honest, I thought the downfall of the movie was going to be Andre 3000. I was wrong. He was actually pretty good in his role. Having two brothers myself, I could relate to a lot of the bickering and arguing that the 4 brothers go through. This movie has great comedy, intense drama, sweet action, and a lot of Mark Wahlberg fighting. And I have now decided that a movie with Mark Wahlberg can not be good unless he punches someone in the face a few times. I mean, let's be honest, he's really good at that. John Singleton deserves a lot of credit too. Considering that the casting was perfect, the story was very interesting, and the acting was far better than I had imagined, I think Singleton did a fine job. Even if you disagree with the above, you cannot disagree that Singleton has a unique way of making innocent faces, like Tyrese and Andre 3000, and making them tough guys with an edge. Don't hold it against him that he worked with Paul Walker in 2 Fast 2 Furious. Remember that he did create Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career. All in all this movie was very entertaining and fun. 4 Brothers is definitely one that you should go see if you like revenge stories and want to see a great mixture of comedy, drama, and action (and who wants to miss Mark pound faces in?).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is really terrible, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. There is no story whatsoever, only shooting and the acting sucks too. Even as just another dumb action movie, it so dumb you can't help but get annoyed. On the back of the DVD it said that it was an emotional drama, but there nothing emotional about it because non of the characters had any depth. The mother in the movie was also badly casted and in the few scenes in which she plays her part, you hardly develop sympathy for her because she looks and acts ridiculous. Finally, there is no movie more predictable than this one. In the past Donnie Wahlberg has proved that he can really act, but in this movie all he can do is fight. Andre 2000 does not act all too bad, but that's the only positive thing I can say about Four Brothers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers has a good title but unfortunately that is about all it has going for it. It lacks a logical story that seems like it would work much better in a video game. The plot is simply horrible, it has too do with Four adopted brothers who come home for the funeral after their mother is killed in a department store shooting. They than decide to shoot up the hole town to find the person or persons who killed her. The first half is a pretty good start but after that the story goes into clichés and lack of anything like a good plot. The script is also awful with bad dialogue and the characters are also just horrible. The performances are horrible and that is quite a surprise when you think about some of the cast. The directed is just horrible, he has no idea where the story is going, the film also has more noticeable flaws than Ihave ever seen in another movie, and I mean stuff like continuity. The visual effects arn't really that good, much worse than I expected only one scene with any effect shots even looks close to being real. Do not watch this movie please!</fullReview>

These are brothers you would not want to get the wrong side of.The movie moves along with the generally fearless and ruthless brothers (and also witty), seeking out a rampage on underground Detroit in order to find out who killed there adopted sweet mother. Meeting some bad guys along the way, including the ruthless gang lord Victor Sweet, the movie contains some excellent scenes, including an excellent car chase in the snow.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Reasons Why This Movie is Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All right, how many of us would actually expect a movie like this to be good or above average? I mean, many urban flicks or street revenge types are usually just average, so-so. But this, I must say, is a good one. The story was catching enough as it is. It might be typical or mindless at times, but it has its funny moments, its tense moments, and parts where you will be at the edge of your seat. There is really not much bad to say about this movie except that maybe the end could have been better and certain parts could have been delivered differently. But there are four reasons (perhaps more) why this movie is good--four main reasons at that. The first one is already mentioned--about the story being catching and so on. The second reason is because in this movie you get a feel of how close these brothers really are, regardless of their differences of race. You see them together as a family and act like everyday brothers when they're not out beating people up. And with that said, the third reason is how convincing the actors are, especially Wahlberg. I have seen him in plenty of movies, but now I think I will see him as the bad boy, hot-headed Bobby from this. He did a very well job as did the rest of the cast. The final reason why this movie is good is because it stays to what it is. It does not stray, suddenly become an intense drama or overly done comedy, etc. I think you know where I'm going here. This movie stays as what it is supposed to be--an urban revenge flick. Other movies like this take whole different route and stray from the story. I was afraid this would do the same, especially when it started explaining why everything happened. But I am happy to say that I am not disappointed. If you are into these types of movies, I'm sure you will feel the same. It was not bad at all =) 7/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers is about 4 adopted brothers (two black, two white) who's mother is shot at the beginning of the movie. The brothers have separated and gone on to do different things. Bobby Mercer, who's hot-headed and doesn't think before his actions, played professional hockey for a while before getting thrown out for being too rough; Jeramiah Mercer, who stayed in Detroit and runs a good business and has a family; Angel Mercer, who's a complete play boy; and the youngest Jack Mercer, who went on to become a rock star. When they discover their mother has been killed, the four brothers come together for the first time in years to avenge her death.This movie stars Mark Wahlberg in his best performance that I've seen, Andre' Benjamin who proves he is a true actor, Tyrese Gibson in his perfect character roll, and Garrett Hedlund, who is definitely the breakthrough actor of the year (in my opinion).I was completely taken by surprise when I saw this movie. It's everything that someone would expect when going to see a movie of this genre. It's got a powerful story, and has an incredibly strong script...probably one of John Singleton's best movies. The actors in this movie know what their doing, and make you feel a real connection with each character. After I walked out of this movie I couldn't stop thinking about the storyline and how each of the actors portrayed their characters. I do not suggest this movie to younger kids at all, because there's way too much violence and language...but I would say, if you can handle watching 8 mile, you are definitely mature enough to watch this, and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

I was completely unable to build a relationship with any of the characters. They were all thugs. I thought the dialogue was too cute and peppy for the tone they were trying to portray. They didn't show enough back story for the characters to justify what they did in the end. The scene at the dinner table where they all see the dead lady was almost laughable.

		<fullReview>Throughly mediocre action movie. Everything is badly over-dramatized, and the plot tries to be layered, but just ends up messy. It redeems itself slightly with a few witty cracks, however in the end it seems like a bad adaptation of a video-game onto the silver screen. The actors do a fairly decent job considering what they've been given to work with, but Mark Wahlberg's character (Bobby Mercer) is so over the top that no acting job can save him. He seems to be a bad clone of Samuel L. Jackson's character in Pulp Fiction - minus everything that made him so great. The action scenes themselves deliver what they promise - if not particularly well. Many of the action scenes seem rather tacked on, and the actually contents of them is often so unrealistically stupid that it's hard to get sucked in.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't really care much for this film. I found it sort of boring with unnecessary violence. The story was slow and not thrilling for a supposed murder mystery. Four adoptive brothers solve the mystery behind there mother's death; it was more than a convenience store robbery. It was a planned murder. There's a lot of shooting and a totally unnecessary girlfriend for one of the brothers. She adds nothing to the film. And some how a dirty cop gets thrown into the mix.And Mark Wahlberg is not looking his best. They got his hair all oily looking and slicked back. Not a great look. But Tyrese is as hot as usual.FINAL VERDICT: I was bored and don't recommend it.</fullReview>

The film was bad anyway but he was seriously miscast - a relative of Singleton perhaps? Chiwetel Ejiofor is an excellent actor with a number of awards under his belt - what was he doing in this film? I know when a film seems bad to me when either I am moved to write a comment or I couldn't care less whether the main characters make it to the end of the film or not.

This movie is bad on many levels, the most egregious is on the credibility. It's ridiculous. On the acting level it is not a movie that any of the actors involved should include on their resume. I was under the impression that Wahlberg was a decent actor. He's terrible in this. I saw Chewi in Dirty Pretty Things where he was very good. He's terrible in this. Seeing so many bad performances in one movie leads you to believe that the director was the fault. That seems to be the common denominator. One could throw some blame to the writers also. Badly written, but in keeping with the quality of the film as a whole. I can't think of one believable character or believable situation in the whole mess. I paid $2 Can. to see this film and I'd say that was about $1.90 too much.</fullReview>

The Latin woman in this movie needs acting classes and the character in general was an insult to women. There were instances where this movie had a Quentin Tarrantino flavor but it didn't work. The chase scene was a joke. It was so unreal that it was almost comical. If John Singleton wanted to make that kind of movie, he should have asked QT for help. There were some good elements to this movie, like the cops. Their storyline and outcome of it was unexpected and great. Too much unrealism mixed in with a potential realistic subject. The "mothers" character was also disappointing. See the movie, buy the DVD but if you go in with high expectations, expect to be disappointed.</fullReview>

If what you have come for is a double helping of playfully gratuitous violence with a refreshingly illiberal side of misogyny, then, odds are, 'Four Brothers' is for you. Nevertheless, to enjoy this movie, means to disregard plot-holes that are too numerous to count and bland, amateur acting across the board. Then again, what can you expect from a film whose three main stars were initially famous for their music, and modeling really gay-looking underwear at Times Square? It's also worth noting that Detroit is a uniquely dilapidated, depressing place. In a better 'Four Brothers,' this circumstance would have allowed for an interesting relationship between the cinematography and the plot. In the one were we are served by the studio, it just makes everything dark, snowy and, for lack of a better word, crappy-looking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I should have taken a notebook to the cinema to write down all the plot holes, continuity issues and just general mistakes I witnessed when I saw this film in the opening night. Luckily I had a free ticket to the cinema because if I had paid to sit through this film I would have demanded my money back. I don't want to add to many spoilers in case you actually decide to watch this waste-of-your-life "film", but please, do yourself a favour and don't see it! If you do, count the number of errors and post here, we can see if we manage to cover them all. OK, so let me try and remember some of the issues from the film. Firstly, the "brothers" haven't been in the neighbourhood for some time - one of them comments that the house is exactly as they left it, so why were there new iMacs in the background - surely these wouldn't have existed when they lived there. In addition, the lady who was killed at the beginning had lots of children staying over, so I am sure she would have changed the rooms and details about the house would have changed since the brothers moved out. Out of the many shootings that took place, it seems that no one actually witnessed any of them in the whole neighbourhood - bizarre. When they go to find the guy in the tower block, the two brothers run up the stairs and tell the third to watch the elevator and tell them where it stops. As soon as it reaches the fifth floor, it seemingly takes the third brother about five seconds to sprint up the five floors that took the other two brothers about 2 minutes to go up! What else, oh yeah they are having that "family dinner" at night time and suddenly Marky Mark announces it's time to play hockey - which appears to happen in the day time. Simple continuity! OK let's move to the scene on the ice - the cars seem to be driving for minutes at top speeds to reach the hole in the ice. Remember that the brother who is going to pay off the gangster doesn't know where they are going. And suddenly, who comes walking over the ice but Marky Mark - that's one hell of a long walk! There were some more continuity issues that were a little harder to notice. In the original shooting scene, the robber loads up his pockets with money then shoots the guy behind the counter, then hears the lady and shoots her, but when the brothers watch the "cctv" tape, you can see the robber shoot the guy behind the till then load his pockets. Embarrassing from start to finish - how people are rating this above a 3 on here I will never know, I thought that people made justified comments on this site before!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the same way that the titular 'four brothers' of this movie demand justice and attempt to bring down the bad guys, so I demand justice and attempt to bring down the ridiculously high rating (6.8) that this corny revenge actioner currently enjoys on IMDb.Mark Wahlberg turns in yet another dreadful performance as Bobby Mercer, one of four delinquents adopted by a saintly old woman. When she is killed in a store robbery, it is up to Bobby and his 'brothers' (played by Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund) to hunt down those responsible. Cue car chases, shootouts and punch-ups.What could have been a gritty tale of revenge is spoilt by ham-fisted direction from John Singleton, some awful performances and a terrible script loaded with stereotypes and clichés.There are so many reasons to hate this film, but if I have to choose the one that nailed it for me, it has to be the spectre of dear old Mom present at the Thanksgiving dinner. As this scene unfolds, I dare you not to feel embarrassed for all involved.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Singleton's "Four Brothers" (2005) takes place in Detroit, Michigan. The first scene starts out with an elderly, good natured woman lecturing a young man about stealing candy from the local convenience store. As soon as the boy leaves two robbers enter the store and proceed to shoot Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan) dead. Shortly after the killing her four sons: Bobby (Mark Walhberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) return for her funeral. After reviewing the footage of the shooting the boys begin to investigate further. The police blatantly tell the brothers to stay out of the investigation. After they interrogate the only witness to the crime, Damien (Lyriq Bent), they begin to realize that this was no ordinary robbery. A hit was ordered on their foster mother for asking questions about her son Jeremiah's latest business deal. Now they come to the conclusion that the police may know more than they are letting on. They decide to take whatever actions are necessary to see that justice is served."Four Brothers" seems to be centered on revenge, with some underlying western morals. The director shows that in some people's eyes revenge is sometimes justifiable. The world is not always black and white; there are gray areas in between. It also showcases the extent of unsolved crimes in Detroit. The characters in the film are out for revenge because a good, kind hearted woman for whom they cared is murdered. The director shows that some people will go to any length to see that justice is served how they see fit.I found this film appealing because the story is about vigilante justice. The subject of vigilante justice is attractive to me because I constantly read about unsolved crimes in the news. Bad things happen to good people all the time and nothing is done about it. In the movie the police appear to be uninterested in catching Evelyn Mercer's killers. I feel like often the police feel that matters are not as serious as the victim feels they are. By the end of "Four Brothers" the bad guys got their just desserts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great modern twist on a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great modern twist on the John Wayne and Dean Martin classic - "The Sons of Katie Elder." Loved Mark Wahlberg's update of John Wayne's character, Outcast's Andre 3000 is great with his take on Dean Martin's character, and Garret Hedlund's take on Michael Anderson Jr's original is simply masterful. The teasing of Jack Mercer is a dead ringer to that of Bud Elder. The direction is outstanding and it is almost exactly identical of Henry Hathaway's where he just let the actors "do what they do" and the dialogue will just developed naturally. I absolutely recommend seeing this movie as well as "The Sons of Katie Elder."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice fur, hon'. Is that all you've got?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Interesting, having a racial mix of four brothers, lame, not developing it at all, as if it would function by itself; and from there, the film crashes down the hill. For example, Mark Wahlberg has the vocal CV to convince he can stand on par with an Afro-American cast. But Garrett Hedlund? Although he was the reason I watched this film, the young actor seemed more like an intern with a fraught mind, rather than a brother. Those wide-eyed looks when in front of the Christmas turkey the ghost of their mother appeared! What was that? Such bad acting from Ms. Mom! A ghost in a film rarely looked cheesier. They even had the nerve to end the film with her.Detroit looked good. Looked excellently haunting in fact. Like the opening in Peter Sellars's "Don Giovanni," a proper fatherless place, a place proper for exploitation. Movie? Not so sure. That kind of film has a let-go quality, while this one surely relied on many a twist and self-satisfaction for old codes sake. The inane, really inane soundtrack proves it. Charles, what have they done to you?The car chase in the snow looked good too. Conchita constantly yelling was an hysterical, not funny device. If they wanted to either convince us a criminal mind can fall for p***y so easily, or that that was intended for comic relief, they should go check their ears: they're tone deaf. Too bad then when Wahlberg imitates her and other voices, it sounds fun and totally misplaced, as if the best parts of the film were some last minute integrated improvisation on set.Mr. Sweet's fur in the snow looked good too, but could not actually divert me from the fact that the film was retail. Now that I come to think of it, it's the kind of retail piece that goes nicely with a wig, a big, elaborate, synthetic wig. But I don't do wigs, man.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can not describe this movie than with a word that draining all and that is "perfect". The way that Garrett Hedlunt acts in this movie is amazing even he is a young actor he got a HUGE potential and Jack Mercer's role is perfect for Garrett. Mark Whalberg with the role of Bobby Mercer the biggest brother that is PERFECT for him and is better that Ethan Hawke, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck turned down the part of Bobby Mercer because the movie is absolutely PERFECT with Mark Whalberg as Bobby Mercer. Let's talk about Jerremiah Mercer(Jerry) played by Andre Benjamin ... this is the worst actor in the whole movie.It's not good for Jeremiah Mercer's role , the movie would be better with Larenz Tate in Jeremiah Mercer's role ... too bad he did not accept the role.

		<fullReview>A terrific movie. Rather, a view on life through the perspective of ordinary men whom through such extreme circumstances, must become as ruthless and ''hot-headed'' as some of the criminals portrayed in this film, consequently implementing their own brand of justice.I came across this film through a recommendation from a friend while in 11th Grade, and 3 years onward this is (and will always remain without doubt) my favourite film. I will not say more, and some may find this comment irrelevant once they see the movie (depicting one's taste which should be respected) but through effective blends of genre (prominently action and drama, with a warming sense of comedy and brotherly love) we see how life brings together four brothers whom have nothing but love for each other in common, hence showing us all the value of family and how unpredictable life is.10/10</fullReview>

What the f*** else do you need to make a great movie? Im sorry, but i don't see what was so bad about this movie. My whole family hated it. I'm the only one who liked it. The story was great, and had a great ending. It had parts that made you laugh, parts where you were sitting on the edge of your seat, waiting to see what happened next, and parts where you were blinking back tears. It was just a great movie all around, and i think that it was definitely worth buying. It was not too violent and gory, but it had the right amount of action, and was brutal when it needed to be. Buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie excels for one simple reason: realistic interplay between the entire cast. I am sure you have read many of the other comments listed here so I wont bother rehashing them here. I just have a few observations on why this was not only a great action movie...but also remarkably heartfelt. Mark Wahlberg gives a convincing performance as the family's lost cause. What is amazing is that we root for him to "win" even though the character really has no redeeming quality's save one: his love and devotion to his family. He and adoptive brothers, as well as a childhood friend turned policeman with whom they share a measure of respect and trust, all interact on a totally believable and nuanced level not found in many movies. The dialog and delivery, as well as the physical interplay between them all, becomes the linchpin on which this film hangs. They are brothers in every sense of the word, complete with petty arguments and intimate familiarity. For me, this makes the entire movie!It also helps that there is a viable antagonist in the character of Victor Sweet. It would have been very easy to paint him as a stereotypical thug boss, but directer John Singleton deftly paints him with a different brush, making him a villain of almost unbelievable arrogance. In Sweet we have an adversary for the brothers that heightens the level of building animosity and tension between everyone...brothers and opponents alike. It is also nice to see a story that plays itself out in the heart of a cold Detroit winter. In most films of this nature, the settings are invariably either warm and sunny or bleak and rain soaked. The discomfort of in-climate weather makes for a more interesting backdrop...especially during the car chase where there are hazards for both the pursued and the pursuers are obvious and exciting!So, to sum up, I thought this was a great movie! There are so many ways that this could have turned out differently, and a misstep in any area, be it direction, characterizations, or pacing, could have rendered this as just another revenge flick...yea, it would still be "good," but certainly not the believable urban drama that are the final results of this movie.Oh, yea, one more thing, the filmmakers did an incredible job with the soundtrack and song placement! Using Marvin Gaye's "Trouble Man" was genius! Behind every song, the filmed scene thrived and bloomed simply because the mood setup was so well done. Watching Mark Wahlberg silently break down to music that mirrors the drama so closely was almost breathtaking...and remarkably effective!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Commercial American movies had been like restaurants' menus. It's the old food with the same crap all over again, yet it's just the new covering. I hate to see one movie with quite potentials and nothing deep. Like it's a junk food. Hell, in here, it's a junk food !A revenge story in new plot with perfect violence, OK, that got a devoted audience for it anyway. But the story could have more, the characters could be more than some absolute animals with hunger for blood and a hideous language. Not to mention a master in action named (John Singleton) who gave us before the great (Rosewood) then movies with the word "brainless" on them, where violence exceeds anything else ! , what's wrong with putting some logic in it, or some things may make it live longer than the traditional age of "another badass action from Hollywood" ?Do you wanna go through it ? Fine ! : Why the alleged Don "Victor Sweet" killed the mom ?, how all the information came that easy to the 4 brothers ?, How they manage to act foolishly and be so right every time ? (The first one will runaway from the basketball match is the one who knows the murderer !!!?), the discoveries seemed horrendous (the killer is the one with the light beard ..Hey there is someone with a light beard at the bar.. Let's kill him !!!?), to get away with all of that eventually in some provocative unexplained way (they told the police officers : we were sleeping with your mothers !). Furthermore, why they cast (Chiwetel Ejiofor) to be the most evil guy in such a world?, he looked like a comedian for god's sake ! a comedian with bad performance too !, speaking of which most of the actors weren't better themselves, they delivered something between weak and unconvincing, not to mention how (Mark Wahlberg) wasn't that charismatic leader or that big brother anyway. And to tell you the truth if that Mama was that kind mentor so what a great job she already did with the boys (learned them how to eat on the table, in the same time that they're still killers or thieves !!!). And finally how about a movie where almost all of Wahlberg's lines were improvised by him.. This is brutal !.So generally the main smart meaning about brotherhood, and how "you're so cold when you're so alone", was not perfectly put.I loved the music, there is loyalty and appreciation for the disco kind of music, it's some salute to the 1970s' Blaxploitation movies that got once great soundtracks that nobody rated them highly as it should be.As you see, this is a movie that could be something like "Get Carter" with what's more than the usual carte. But it's Hollywood when it insists on being another McDonalds, however it's a combo this time, not a sandwich. And the food is given with blood, not ketchup !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of those movies where most people, when they see the movie poster in the hallway to their local multiplex, will mostly skip over and either not decide to see it or decide they'll tell one of their friends to go see it first and tell them how it was. In all honesty, this was my attitude when I first saw the previews.The basis of the plot line is that the adoptive mother of four hopelessly lost degenerates (Fionnula Flanagan) is brutally murdered and these four brothers all return to their familiar (and violent) streets to bury their beloved mother and to discover the one behind the murder. Moving hastily from one retrieved clue to another, Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg), Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson), Jerry Mercer (Andre 3000), and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) use one another's strong points to uncover a vast and disturbing political cover-up that leads deep into the dirty underbelly of their home town only to lead to an almost perfectly executed ending that will probably leave you wondering where and how such a story could be pulled together with little to no flaws in it.Although this story is no Academy Award winner or nominee for that matter, it definitely has its strong points. Quite the number of entertaining interaction of "brotherly love" between the four brothers is the highlight of the movie in between shoot-outs and chase scenes with the baddies of the films. And the unnerving portrayal of the villain, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofer) has a ring of familiarity to it as Denzel's bad guy from Training Day.All in all a satisfying movie with funny lines (espically with delivered by Mark Wahlberg's tough Detroit street accent), great action scenes, and an ending happy enough to make your heart melt the sixteen inches of snow in the film, Four Brothers is definitely worth checking out if not worth adding to your DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was slightly suspicious of this movie, mainly for it's plot line that has been used, for better and for worse, in other movies of this genre. But I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness and inventiveness of it.The choice of actors is inspiring, especially considering the 'musical' background of several of the lead characters, but the strength of the acting is pretty awesome. I actually believed in the characters and sympathised/supported them. The scenes where they are relaxing at the family home brought a broad smile to my face.John Singelton's deft touch with pace, plot and action is excellent. So for what it's worth, go watch this film and enjoy every minute of it.</fullReview>

Sofía Vergara is hilarious, and she and Gibson had a great chemistry together.Benjamin, Hedlund, and Howard created believable characters, but I thought Wahlberg and Gibson carried the film.The story itself is what keeps me from rating the film any higher. It's pretty good, but is really just a remake of John Wayne's "The Sons of Katie Elder". The only changes were minor tweaks and updating to modern day Detroit, but there really is no significant difference between the two stories. Maybe I should call that a "spoiler", 'cause if you've seen the John Wayne flick, you know how this comes out.In society, I don't think anyone really wants people going around taking their own revenge, dispensing their own justice, or using torture and violence to extract information from a suspect, but it does make good cinema!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad - clichéd, but it grew better as it went on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For about the first 20 minutes of this movie I was trying to decide whether it was believable or likable. Yes it feels pretty run-of-the-mill, but I enjoyed the central theme of the 4 brothers after the movie progressed and was over. Mark Walberg is pretty much himself as an actor like lot of actors....his movies are often hits or misses. This one's not quite either, maybe a little closer to a hit - it has some good action scenes - especially the snowy car chase. I began to like the characters more as the dialogue progressed and despite some implausibilities - like the good old clichéd bank pulling out $400k in cash I was willing to overlook them to enjoy the brothers and their predicament. The side-story dirty cop didn't detract either and was nicely woven into the main one. The movie score is pretty weak though at times - you'd think it was straight off a TV episode.....not bad - worth the rental.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've seen this movie some times ago and I must confess that I've fallen in love with it.I think the actors' play is very well done, Mark Wahlberg perfectly incarnates the biggest of the family, the leader, by trying to hide his sadness and to find his mother's murderer.Tyrese Gibson, well known thanks to the movie 2 Fast and 2 furious, plays the role of a macho in love with a Latina girl who makes them being in trouble. But he has his great part in the movie by trying to know why his brother Jeremiah is broken.Andre Benjamin is the wisest of the family. He has stopped his silly things to invest himself in his own family. He's a great father and husband. But is project is destroy when he learns that he's broken. He decides to use his mom's insurance to pay his bills towards the men who broke him.And my favorite, Garrett Hedlund, saw in Troie, who's the youngest of the group. He's a " 3rd type rocker", very naive. He's very protected by his brother Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) and it makes him be the most sensitive of them. He's landing in the adults' world and it's a great chock for him to lose his mom (who saved him from his moral injuries) and to see that his brothers can kill without any remorse.I advice everybody to see this movie he's very well done ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Four Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A kind old lady is murdered in cold blood one snowy night in a convenience store. It seemed like the usual stick up by racist hoodlums on the hard streets of Detriot, and that the lady was collateral damage.Four orphaned brothers of the hood are brought back together to mourn the loss of their foster mother. We see the Mercer brothers Bobby, Angel, Jeremiah and Jack, bond together as they try not to openly weep. But deep down inside, they know the police can't do much to help a covered-up investigation, and swear sweet revenge upon those involved in the killing.I was expecting loads of gun battles and intense action, but this movie surprised me with its witty moments instead. There weren't much wham-bang action, but the one which stood out was the ambush on the Mercer house, and the car chase sequence along frozen streets. The script was mildly intelligent with its weaving of the brothers' dalliances with the hoodlums, contract killers, government officers, and with crooked cops, bringing them all together for an interesting finale.The last Mark Wahlberg movie I saw was The Italian Job remake, and here, Wahlberg reigns as he personifies the cocky hotheaded Bobby Mercer. Andre Benjamin seemed somewhat muted too, after his recent screen stint as a flamboyant and trigger-happy gangster in Be Cool. Perhaps it is his role as the family man which adds that extra dimension and difference between him and the rest of the brothers - he can't be as carefree or act with total disregard as he has people who depend on him.This film also makes no apologies in adding that bit of realism to its dialogue, with street language and cursing aplenty, with plenty of stereotypical characters.But all in all, it's an enjoyable flick, as we observe in silent glee, the four brothers exacting revenge with R&amp;B music humming along in the background.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lately, there aren't many revenge flicks that coming to us. I guess they're out of fashion. And those that were released, weren't interesting at all. "The Punisher" was boring, "Man on fire" was dumb and exaggerated and "Wake of Death" was OK for a b-movie, but clearly not something you would pay money for it in the cinema. "Four Brothers" slightly improves the revenge movie's latest record.This movie nor brilliant, neither original. All the turn points in it were already used in other movies with some slight deviations. But it was decently done and very entertaining, so I wasn't grieving for a loss of nearly two hours of my time. "Four Brothers" it's one of those movies that you enjoy while you seeing them and forget the day after. There are no blood rivers ,to shock you and to emphasize the feelings of the brothers, neither tortures ( like in most of other revenge movies ), to make us feel the impact of the revenge; which makes it more light and more entertaining. Overall, I would say that I liked it. It has some good action scenes and a decent plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four Brothers... One Mother... A whole lotta trouble... and fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singleton finally hits his stride with this surprisingly deep character study disguised as a mystery, action flick. What a delight it is to find a truly color-blind movie that isn't *trying* to be color-blind. The fact that two brothers are white and two are black isn't trawled for the "We Are the World" fakery that usually accompanies dramas with mixed-race families. The brothers here are just that, brothers who have a common bond in the horrors they suffered before a selfless, loving woman adopted them. The relationship they share is admirable, by anyone's standards. The mother isn't portrayed as a saint, but rather a real person who had a genuine love for hurting children, and a knack for putting them on the straight-and-narrow.This film marks the first time I have ever seen a movie that was able to capture the deep, abiding love that I have for my brother and sister. Singleton shows his maturity in this film in several ways, the most pointed is the common personality traits the brother's share that obviously has been imparted by their mother. Her loving presence is felt throughout the film through the actions, emotions and relationship the brother's share. Sprinkled here and there are little flashbacks showing Evelyn interacting with each of her sons; it is done with great sensitivity and is very powerful.The pacing is crisp and steady with absolutely no lulls in the story. The plot is very believable, and the villain is not the run-of-the-mill bad guy. No punches are pulled vis-?-vis the violence, people die and the brothers do the killing. I LOVED this about the film; I am so very tired of movies trying to keep the principles sympathetic by separating them from the dirty work of busting heads and shooting folks. The brothers are on a mission to find out who killed their mother and why, and they are willing to do *anything* to find out. They don't spend loads of time arguing with the bad guys, or pretending that they will hurt them, yet never doing so. They march right through each situation, hurting and killing the people responsible for their mother's death, and it is *refreshing*. Men from the street don't mess around, they don't carry around lots of moral baggage, and this is what we want to see in a revenge movie. When we go to see a film like this, we want to see people do what we wish we could do to people who wrong us. Four Brothers promises to show this, and delivers on that promise in FULL.Typically in movies of this nature, character development is sacrificed to make room for the action. In this film the character development DRIVES the action. It is deft and deeply creative, a three-punch combination of script, direction and acting comes off like clockwork. Singleton has, at long last, found his niche in this genre. As a younger man he thought that poignancy could only be found in dramas that indict some segment of our society. In Four Brothers he clearly understands that relevancy is found in issues of the human heart, and what MOVES the human heart. In past films it seemed that he was only interested in touching his audience through the stark and painful aspects of life. In Four Brothers, Singleton is exploring so much more than the meaner side of life, here he is interested in dissecting the entire beast, and he succeeds with beauty and affection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Crime Drama/Family Drama Hybrid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>FOUR BROTHERS (3 outta 5 stars) Well-done crime drama/family drama hybrid benefits a lot from some of the fine actors involved. Even when the movie falls apart towards the end (with one ridiculous plot complication or hard-to-believe moment after another), it has built up so much goodwill that you can't be too upset. True, it does keep the movie from being a classic, but it's fun and exciting in ways that too few modern action-thrillers are. I don't generally care much for Mark Wahlberg's acting but... he doesn't hurt the movie... too much. He gets the showiest role in the movie's big "showdown" but he is definitely the least interesting of the "four brothers". Andre Benjamin (of OutKast/"Hey Ya" fame) does a great job in his first big role... but it's Garrett Hedlund, another new film face, who steals the movie as the youngest brother. As previously mentioned, credibility takes a beating at times... but the focus on the relationship between the adopted brothers helps to keep the movie from going right off the deep end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i really liked this movie.don't know if it was a conscious thought or not and this is not a criticism.i think this was an updated version of"the sons of Katie elder" that starred john Wayne &amp; dean martin.both of these movies had a similar plot of 4 disparate brothers avenging the death of their mother &amp; in the case of Katie elder, of their father. both of these mothers were mothers who gave their best to raise upright sons &amp; really kept loving them even if they were flawed.in "four brothers", it shows that black &amp; white men can really be brothers in a common cause.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An action film that easily trumps this years releases...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This summer has featured a lack of movies with any redeemable qualities, so I half-expected the mid-August release of "Four Brothers" to be terrible, even though the trailer to the film made it look like an incredible action movie with, get this, actual character development to go along with gripping action scenes. Thankfully, I was very wrong in this assumption as Four Brothers turned out to be easily the best action movie of the year and possibly one of the better movies of the year that I've been subjected to.Set in Detroit, Four Brothers puts the camera on four adopted brothers who have come home to find that their saintly elderly mother has been slain in a robbery-gone-wrong. After doing a little dirt digging, however; they find that their mothers' death was no random act and that some old-fashioned revenge killing is in order.Since the movie is set in Detroit, we can naturally assume that most crimes go unaddressed, which reminds us to forgive the film for allowing our heroes to go around brandishing weapons in public and threatening people. Surprisingly though, this is the only major leap in our judgment that we're forced to make as the rest of the film does a good job of preventing any plot holes that would take away from it. This rock-solid plot is coupled with strong acting performances from the entire cast and some very intense action, including an excellent chase scene and an awesome firefight.In the end, Four Brothers looks at this summers release of movies, the Deuce Bigalows, the Dukes of Hazzards, the Stealths, and it tells them that they suck, that they shouldn't have been released, and then it shoots them. This is a fine movie that you should definitely make your ways to the cinemas for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just saw this movie today &amp; was very surprised at how good it was. I thought it was going to be the typical gangsta rap movie but it wasn't; there was really a storyline. The chemistry between the actors made you believe they were brothers--their bond was that strong. They even acted like brothers picking on each other all the time. I also believed they loved their mother &amp; I that they were a family. One moment you were laughing at these guys; the next you were in shock &amp; total silence at what they were going through. You felt for these guys. Lots of violence but it fit the story. It was great! A movie to get when it comes out on DVD... I will definitely see it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics really don't know a good movie when they see one. I'm tired of reading bad reviews on this movie. I go to prove them wrong. I knew this would be an awesome movie and it was! The audience was also clapping and cheering at this movie! I was on the edge of my seat and loving every second of it. The only thing predictable about this movie was that one of the brothers would get shot and he died, but not the one I thought would. Everyone thought differently. John Singleton took a predictable storyline and completely changed it around and that's what kept everyone on the edge of their seats. With some comedy and quick laughs thrown it for fun, this movie was awesome! I could not love Mark Wahlburg anymore! Great acting all around. Storyline in Detroit made it even more memorable!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had no idea what to expect when I went in to the theater to watch this film and so I came out very pleasantly surprised. It's a classic action movie for the new millennium with a decent revenge plot that has enough twists and turns to keep the audience guessing what's going on. It also has some phenomenal set piece action sequences; I can honestly say that there are moments where I can compare this film to Michael Mann's, "Heat".The film is not going to be enjoyed by everyone, it's not going to get critical appraise for the cerebral content, and there's no way that it will get any Oscars. Having said all that, I would still recommend it for anyone who wants a roller-coaster, action packed movie thriller.</fullReview>

I thought Garrett Hedlund actually did very well also. I was surprised. I haven't heard much about him, and was pleasantly surprised at his character/acting. Tyrese had charisma, and Mark Wahlberg was great, which he usually is, in my opinion. This movie was very touching, funny at times, action-packed.. it was definitely worth the price of admission!

		<fullReview>John Singleton never really seems to disappoint me, the story might be a little far-fetched for some people and depending on how you look at the whole street justice thing it might raise questions morally but I think it was well put together and well acted. I also liked the similarities and some of the differences that each of the brothers had, they were all endearing to me.I also enjoyed the passion showed by the characters for their mother and doing anything in their power to find who was responsible for their mother's killer. The camaraderie it wonderful.I also love the gritty look and feel of some of the different Detroit locales.I also like the transition Andre Benjamin's character, Jeremiah goes through.The lone walk that Mark Whalberg takes at the end with the long coat and crucifix to match, was one of the best shots to me...cliché or not.The frozen river just driving on it looked cool not to mention the other things that happened.Unfortunately the theater I went to, everyone spent so much time laughing uproariously at every joke I missed a bunch of dialogs but I still thoroughly enjoyed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perfect characters that fit the right roles along with plot developments that really made you feel like you felt for the brothers. Quite a bit of swearing, but not necessarily gratuitous, as well as a realistic amount of violence made it enjoyable for many audiences. I give it an easy 10. Mark Whalberg and Tyrese Gibson play the perfect "bad a**es" while Andre and Garrett Hedlund counter as the skinny Irish and black characters. The key to the success of Four Brothers was the battle between the good and the bad, the brother's, green, and others in the hood, against Sweet and his gang. I definitely recommend you see the movie, no questions asked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>CONTAINS SPOILERS I really enjoyed this film. I thought that the four actors had great chemistry and I completely believed that they had been raised together. All four did a great job, but Mark Wahlberg and Andre Benjamin stood out to me. Wahlberg played this character so well. Bobby Mercer comes across as a hothead who would kill his own brother if he had a good enough reason. Andre plays Jerry very well as the cautious family man who does not want to get wrapped up into the ways of his youth but after seeing his family attacked twice he can't look away anymore. The other two actors, Tyrese and Hedlund also played their parts well. Angel may have been in the Marines but he remembered his roots and knows family is first. Hedlund plays the youngest brother who is seemingly more innocent than the others very well. The film as a whole was entertaining, it went through a range of emotions, sadness, anger, humor and even a little fear of what is going to happen to these four brothers. The supporting cast does a good job, Terrence Howard is good as the cop who knows where his old friends come from. The thugs in Sweets gang were frightening to me. An added bonus is the soundtrack which is mostly old Motown was great to listen to an offered a balance to the majority of the film. There are some great comedic moments, some great action scenes especially the car chase. The gun battle to me seemed very realistic and not fake. Overall a film I highly recommend if you are in for a good character-driven action film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While Four Brothers was a little slow to start, be patient, when the action starts you will be out of your seat. Mark Whalberg commands his character and will move you with (being careful not to give anything away) the things he says. You will hear members of the audience responding in kind to what Mark says at times. He has incredible talent and again demonstrates it under the direction of John Singleton. His fellow actors offer up HUGE support and perform equally as well. The plot is solid and takes you in many directions, pay attention and make certain you follow it.

		<fullReview>Original no non-sense dramedy that really delivers the goods. The talented cast shines thanks to a superior script and effective dialog. As dramatic as the story's plot may seem though, the whole thing made me laugh almost as much as Wedding Crashers.Falls short of higher scores in my book, because of a few too many awkward, bul%$%$ty sentimental grieving scenes, which all having been said, don't dramatically impact the movie's quality.My advice: Check it out at the theater, well worth the ticket price. Not sure if it is the type of movie worth being purchased on DVD, but if only to share it with friends not lucky enough to have seen it on screen, it would probably be worth it. (assuming you're a good friend)Mark Wahlberg (Bobby Mercer) 8/10 Probably one of the most underrated lead men out thereTyrese (Angel Mercer) 6/10 Decent performance, nothing less, nothing more.André 3000 (Jeremiah Mercer) 7/10 Solid start.Garrett Hedlund (Jack Mercer) 6/10 Decent performance, nothing less, nothing more.Sofía Vergara (Sofi) 7/10 Very attractive.

		<fullReview>John Singleton put it all out on the line with his new movie titled Four Brothers. The movie has an intricate storyline where four adopted brothers reunite to attend their mother's funeral, and bond together to find out the reason for her murder. It has much action and substance as the brothers led by Bobby Murcer (played well by Mark Wahlberg) go throughout many places looking for clues and witnesses which lead them through adventurous shootouts and many interesting characters. The music fits in very well, especially the Marvin Gaye song Trouble Man which captures the film's sad yet determined and anxious mood perfectly. Singleton's best movie since Boyz N Da Hood. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Saw it on video for free ...GOOD THING IT WAS FREE {SPOILERS}</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this winner on video for free {guarenteed in stock} It was so bad it mad me want to quit watching movies. Bad dialog, poor acting, I thought I was watching some crap on ActionMax. But it wasn't even that good and I didn't see the Dolph Lungren, Eric Roberts or Some French or Spanish or Danish or Canadian or Portegese Former Five Time Gymkata Champion in the movie so I realized it was a DVD rental and not ActionMax after all. What is Marky Mark thinking. Was it the opportunity to work with Singleton that motivated him to sign up for this garbage? They tried to make it Detroit like. Shots of burn't out houses, Closed factories, hockey and some other standard slum shots. It's such standard BS. I'm from Detriot and the only place they ever played hockey was in the suburbs. Detriot is one of the most segregated cities in the country and I guarantee you that nobody with dark skin past 8 mile road is playing hockey with a bunch of white guys. If there is any game going on in the city limits of Detriot it's basketball and basketball only. Hockey is illegal inside the city limits unless they are playing inside Joe Louis Arena and the Red Wings are involved. This movie had a disgraceful script combined with equally bad acting and directing. What bad guy works for a crimeboss who humiliates him and abuses him. They should have had him running a gang of Tammy Wynettes instead of gangsters. These guys are criminals, killers and business men and the CEO is going to talk about sleeping with one of the board members wives!!??!! I see this all the time in crappy gangster movies like this. In real life the boos would have been fired immediately and literally for treating the higher ups with such dis-respect. That's why in real life things are run like the Guidos do, if there is a problem with one of the managers they are fired discreetly with one behind the ear. Not constantly humiliated. Who would follow that? And yet time and time again in movie they have the over the top Crime Boss abusing people who are closest to him and responsible for his income and security. Give me a break. They should have made a real movie about Detroit. The brothers come back and are surprised that Greektown is now Casino Town.... Shocking. That they lived in the mostly white Burbs and that the people of color are actually starting to segregate the whole city {slowly} and that there are actually Black people living one the 'other side' of 8 mile in Roseville, the Shores and other parts of the city {at one time unheard of, especially in Grosse Pointe or St Clair Shores} The Crime boss could have been a real business man with loyal employees/criminals who loved and respected him or her. The Brothers could have hunted down the killer{s} without crazy antics like whipping out a gun at a high school basketball game.... which in real life would have a few of Detroits finest working it... a mandatory presence for years at High School in the inner and and High School events.... that scene was retarded. They could have pieced together the tragedy and confronted a sorry {maybe of course Christopher Walken playing an Arabic businessman which would have been perfect}crime boss working at some Party Store or body shop...located of course way out in the suburbs... Oakland county ....Way out in a good area where he washes some of his money at his supposedly legit business. The perpitraitors of the senseless act would have been executed immediately .... not because they killed the mother... but because the attention would cost some of the operations money... the real hanging offense for a crime family. The four brothers should have all been college graduates.... raised in a tough area but since they were raised right {by the martered and now sainted mother } they all left and were leading higher end lives instead of being a bunch of blue collar clowns {yes I know Andre was supposed to be in Real Estate}. This movie was bad, over-the-top crap. Everyone involved drops a notch in my book. It was an easy check to cash for Singleton and Marky Mark... they should be embarrassed.</fullReview>

What thought, this movie has "balls" it does stuff you won't normally see or conceive done on silver screen anymore. Its ultra violent at times and others it has humor you'd find among family. It has some unbelievable parts, such as big villain, but its played will enough, you won't mind seeing revenge on this turd. Its a good ugly action movie, with black humor thrown in. Its refreshing to me, since i hardly get into this kind of particular kind of movie. Also, its not as predictable, which i find refreshing. If you want something that not too stupid, and unbelievable, but at same time not soft in way its done. I'd try this out and enjoy the ride it gives you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In my opinion, the biggest problem with 4 Bros, is that it's not believable. There is no real sense of relationship between the four main characters; the Thanksgiving dinner scene is very awkward, and much of the time you see four actors saying lines instead of a family interacting. Overall, the acting is not good except for Wahlberg; although they all had their moments here and there. None of them was believable in the emotional scenes despite the fact that they were able to bring tears; it almost always seemed forced. Tyrese's Latina girlfriend displays just about every imaginable stereotype associated with her background; I would have expected better from someone that grew up in Los Angeles (Singleton). Her character seems to exist only to have a hot chick. As far as I could tell, she had no affect whatsoever on the outcome of the situation. You know it's a bad sign when you're watching a movie and don't care how it ends; in fact, I didn't stick around to find out. I saw 90% of it, I just decided I wanted something to eat more than I wanted to find out the exact way the movie arrives at its very predictable conclusion. If the it doesn't end with Wahlberg beating the absolute crap out of the Victor Sweet guy while delivering the occasional witty remark, somebody let me know. Seriously, don't see this movie, even for free (like I did). There are so many other movies out there, although most of them are not in the theaters. Only watch this on an airplane; don't even rent it.</fullReview>

It's amazing that the city of Detroit didn't protest this smear on its name. Having lived there for a year, this portrayal is totally unfair and stereotypical. That dinner table scene was so maudlin that it could have been done by a first year film student, and the mother character was so bad she was scary.

		<fullReview>This movie just wasn't very good, and the current rating of 7.1 will slowly decrease as more sensible people vote on it. The plot was silly, the acting was mediocre, and the directing was surprisingly under par. Think for a second about the climax where Mark Wahlberg (who must have been hiding in the snow, or dropped from a plane) comes out of the middle of nowhere, bouncing menacingly to ridiculous hip hop music, and engages the "bad guy" in a fist fight. Accepting for the time being that he came out of nowhere and that's o.k., why oh why would the wahlberg character give his mother's murderer the chance for a fair fight. Also, how about the very first scene where the two hoods rob the convenience store. We learn later that they were sent there specifically to murder the old lady. But in the first scene of the movie, the two hoods don't even know the woman was there until she screams. The idea is that we will be surprised later on when we find out that she was assassinated. That's just cheap. Now I'm not saying this movie was a total piece of crap, but the problems I've mentioned (and there were many more), are common in B action movies, which is what Four Brothers is. It's just disguised as something different.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This urban action film is based on a simple plot of revenge as four men hunt for their mother's killer. Mark Wahlberg and three young men take it upon themselves to find out who's responsible for the murder and are little more than a vigilante group who bully and threaten neighborhood contacts for information about the crime. There are plenty of action scenes which seem contrived simply to show off special effects and stunt work, and the soundtrack is an ode to Motown stars of the past. Terence Howard is good as part of the otherwise undistinguished supporting cast. The film offers nothing new amid its violent and chaotic story and is just another ghetto shootout film that misfires.</fullReview>

However, I just couldn't believe that over 2,000 members here thought this movie was a 10. I'd rather see the original 1960s John Wayne film, The Sons of Katie Elder, in which this is a flimsy remake.

Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg), Angel Mercer (Tyrese Gibson) and Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) join the regenerated ex-union leader Jeremiah Mercer (Andre Benjamin), and they decide to investigate the murder. They disclose that her execution was intentional, and resolve to find the criminals by themselves."Four Brothers" is an excellent tale of revenge. John Singleton triggers his shotgun everywhere, showing corruption in the Legislative Assembly and in the Police Force of Department of Detroit. This film is attractive since the very beginning and does not lose the pace. The sequence with the car chase in the snowy streets is amazingly perfect. The description of the dangerousness of each brother and why Evelyn adopted them is hilarious and gives an excellent introduction to the story. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Quatro Irm?os" ("Four Brothers")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>movie for jerks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I got this movie because i really like mark, he is such a good actor. but i was very disappointed with this movie. Four brothers was the worst movie I've seen in a long time. I mean seriously did the movie makers think that in this time and age , they could get away with women acting so stupid in a movie. and the language is utterly distasteful. that poor woman is happier dead than with those four jerks. i hated it...its the first Indian cinema type Hollywood film. when the movie started i was very interested and then by the first half of it i was so angry that i did not want to watch another second. Don't waste your time an money on this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four lawless brothers depicted as heros</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is so wrong on many levels. The gun violence is so over the top it boarders on stupidity. Every cop in the country should revolt against this movie, it depicts them as stupid, corrupt unprofessional and ineffective. The heros are gun wielding, drug taking, lawless, anarchists, bullies with no redeeming qualities except grief for their shotgunned down mother. The movie takes place in this make belief world, called Detroit, where all the people are huddled in their homes watching and letting these four nuts run the world. At one point in the movie the corrupt cop walks out of a bar full of people with his cop partner, shoots his partner then pretends to act like there is another person there who actually did the shooting, gets on his radio and says he needs backup and shoots his gun next to the radio for effect. All this is done without one person coming out of the bar to see what is going on or anyone coming to windows all around the shooting. This is an ugly anti social movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what a huge waste of my time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my first comment ever. I want to tell the truth about Four Brothers. I got this DVD based on the 6.8 IMDb rating it received. Usually, I find these ratings to be pretty reliable. In this case, I was seriously misled. Don't make the same mistake. This movie sucks.The plot makes no sense. The acting is miserable. It's boring and full of clichés. Normally, I like action films -- even when they're not great quality. This one is a disaster. Don't believe the last 10 comments on here. I could accept an IMDb rating of something between 4 and 5.5 for this movie. Nothing more. And it would only be that high because some people don't seem to care about a film's writing, acting, or plot. As long as there's a decent car chase and plenty of guns going off, then there's no need to worry about such minor details as coherence, dialogue, and and character development. Do yourself a favour: do not waste two hours on this garbage.I would give it a 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, contrived crap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton, the director of the excellent "Boys in the Hood", has fallen far. "Four Brothers" is rubbish.Even worse, it is forced, contrived rubbish. Dumb-ass premise sees four adopted brothers return to the town of their upbringing to attend the funeral of their murdered foster mother. While hanging out and opening old wounds, they decide to take the law into their own hands and find the murderers. Not exactly original, but it is the treatment of the material that sucks the biggest.The opening prologue, where Singleton introduces the boys' mother and busts his gut to show what a good Samaritan she is, is pure, sickly, badly written melodrama. The scenes following the funeral, in which we are given flashback snippets of the boys' interactions with their mother while they are tucking into a giant Thanksgiving turkey, are nauseating. It is clear so early on that Singleton's structure is unworkable and his approach is horribly miscalculated.Another major irritant is the godawful music and unoriginal use of sound. The result is a flat, unconvincing, superficial piece of Hollywood junk. It is sad to see the talented Singleton succumbing to such puerile, artificial nonsense.There are a few violent sequences, but none of these cancel out the damage done by the film's total lack of realism and heinous resorting to the most whipped-to-death cinematic clichés.Awful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful, just plain awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot for the life of me understand the two thumbs up from Ebert and Roeper. The plot is filled with clichés, the dialog is forced and poorly written, and the acting is downright shameful. I'm having trouble deciding whether Mark Wahlberg is worse at acting or rapping. Sadly, I think John Singleton had one movie in him.It's a good thing that Bobby Mercer (Mark Wahlberg) commented on the poor police work in Detroit in the beginning of the movie. Fortunately, that explains a lot of the awful tangents from reality that this movie takes. How does one go to an inner city basketball game, interrupt the action, wave a pistol around, and then have time to calmly question an innocent kid in the hallway right afterward? Well, the police in Detroit are lousy. Oh yeah.. he said that in the beginning. That explains it. How does a Wild West shootout happen in front of your house, leaving dead bodies strewn all over the street, and you and your brothers sit calmly on your stoop while the police tsk-tsk you for taking matters into your own hands? Oh yeah.. that crappy police thing. That one line sure goes a long way in this movie.The clichés are all over the place in this plot. The two-bit hustler turned crime boss, the dirty city councilman who appears to be trying to clean up the neighborhood while he's secretly in cahoots with said crime boss, the dirty cop killing his partner, the One Good Cop who really seems to care, the plot twist that leads them to wrongly suspect one of the brothers, the weakest brother dying because he was a little too spunky, the boxing match to settle all scores, et cetera ad nauseum. Why at the end of the movie are these two guys (who supposedly hate each other with a passion) exhibiting such fine boxing form, throwing jabs and bobbing and weaving? The acting in this movie is just plain terrible. The best example is the Bobby Mercer line, as their running from the bodega to look for the guy with an afro (who turns out to not have such a big afro afterall - curious.. maybe he got a haircut and Singleton didn't notice). He says something like, "that wasn't a holdup, it was a contract killing. Let's go!" They all take off at a brisk jog. Now.. obviously Singleton believes that a lot of stupid people are going to watch this film so that he needs his characters to ham-handedly spell out the plot twists. But why are they running? And why does Mark Wahlberg have to deliver each line like he's reading a comic book? Honestly, that line should have been followed by the horn section doing the Batman theme (Na na na na na na na na...) One brother has a Boston accent (Mark Wahlberg), one sounds like he's from New York (Garret Hedlund), one gravel-voices his way through every line like Wolverine in X-Men (Tyrese Gibson), and worst of all Andre (3000) Benjamin does nothing to mask his durrty south accent. If Singleton was going to go out of his way to make Detroit a part of the movie, the least he could do is lead us to believe that the characters might actually be from Detroit.I also found it amusing (not in a good way) when Angel (Tyrese Gibson) calls Jeremiah "white boy" in a derogatory tone. I guess Bobby (Mark Wahlberg) who was standing right next to him was white in a manner that was acceptable at that moment. Curious.It took great effort to actually finish watching this movie, and in the end I was sorry that I did. As if the cliché-ridden plot weren't enough to doom this movie, the acting and directing drag it even lower. Was this film somehow affiliated with Disney? That's the only reason I can fathom for the "thumbs up" from E&amp;R.Honestly.. don't waste your time. This movie stays just as bad throughout as it is in the beginning.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think John Singleton got himself into debt, and needed to pay some bills quickly.As one of my fellow movie patrons said "I think John Singleton took a crap on a piece of film and this is the result"The acting was junk. The shoot-out was just unbelievable. "Someone call 911!" at the end? If people out front of MY house were using automatic weapons, I don't think we would need to call 911 at the end of it. On top of all this, acting? Stunk. Script? Stunk more. The "plot" "turns" were like driving down a straight road. You could see what was coming from a mile away. Besides special effects and car chases, I think a 4th grader could have written a more compelling script, and certainly got his/her friends to act better than various characters in this heap. Specifically, the youngest brother, and every single cop in this movie.Save your money! Only watch this movie if you are stuck on a long flight, can't sleep, and didn't bring something to read.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first heard about this movie, I thought it'd just be another one of those action, revenge movies that had a lot of good fighting but no real good plot. But when I borrowed the DVD, I was surprised by how well made it actually was. It shows scenes of the brothers doing and saying things you can see real brothers do that makes the characters memorable and makes this movie very real, relatable and fresh from what we see now in Hollywood. It's a great mix of drama, action, and humor with (if you pay close close attention to what they say) a great storyline. It's not one of the best movies ever made, but it's definitely a great, refreshing film worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wahlberg = Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome to The Sons Of Katie Elder set in wintery Detroit.Mark Wahlberg plays an urban version of John Wayne's patriarchal oldest brother in a decent reimagination of the western in an updated setting. A nice wrinkle is added by having the brothers all adopted, two black and two white, and all bad kids rescued from ruin by the good hearted mother. The fact that these were bad kids in the first place means that it is not a huge step for them to take actions which are somewhat outside what we would normally expect the "heroes" to take. Having said that, there are few characters in here who are not morally compromised in this movie, and those who are morally sound mostly suffer bad fates.But this is a solid crime thriller, always intriguing, well acted, with solid emotional investment throughout, and some unexpected twists and turns.I enjoyed it greatly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four brothers=four snow angels.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Timeless. Movie feels as if it was made ten, or even twenty years ago. Or maybe in the future? A revenge tale, competently steered by Director John Singleton, hits on all cylinders. Although this crackerjack, high octane thriller has a high body count, it is, I think, a very sweet film of brotherly love toward each other and their adoptive mother. The four Mercer brothers--two white, two black--reunite for their mother's funeral. She has been murdered, execution-style, by a couple of street punks. Hired guns. Mark Walberg is perfectly cast as the lead. He's one of the few white actors who would be believable in such a role. His timeout during a high school basketball game (to search some souls for information on the killing) is staged and plotted well. You believe he's a tough guy who takes no crap. Singleton's choice to shoot the film in the winter, the period between Thanksgiving and Christmas, in a decayed Detroit, is the spot-on right thing to do. When was the last time you saw a car chase in a snowstorm? Sweet direction there. Sofia Vergara spins a keen turn as one of the brothers' girl friends. One small quibble: the scene where Walberg cuts the rope of a bad guy repelling off the face of a project, should have include the baddie firing away when falling backward, a wink-and-a-nod to Sharkey's Machine. The complicated corruption narrative has you engrossed from the start. Why would anyone kill a sweet old lady, anyway? The whos and the whys are properly addressed before the film ends. The last confrontation between the evil gangster (he forces a henchman to eat his dinner off the floor) and the good-by-default Bobby Mercer (he loves hockey) lead to a quirky climax on a frozen lake. Fish bait? Simply catch the movie with a comfy comforter and a cup of cocoa in order to find out why--and to warm you up a bit. It's a cold movie to watch. This flicker might give you a bad case of frost bite. No snow job there.On a personal note: The name Bobby Mercer (the more common spelling) always brings a smile to my face. The former major leaguer--ex-Yankee, Giant, and Cub--Bobby Murcer, was my favorite baseball player when I was growing up. He passed away last year at the age of 62. A piece of my childhood died that day. This movie resurrected it for about two hours. One last thing: I think the writer should have used the "Murcer" spelling simply because if you change the "c" to a "d," it spells murder. An apt description of what takes place throughout this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They have returned back home to gloomy freezing cold at winter Detroit for their mother's funeral. She was shot in what seemed a random robbery-gone-wrong in a convenient store. There were four brothers even though they did not resemble each other a bit. All four were adopted by a murdered woman many years ago when she was a social worker and tried to find new homes for the children from dysfunctional families. Nobody wanted those four. She did. She took them in, brought them up, gave them love and support and they called her mom and themselves - brothers. Now she is dead, and the brothers start their own investigation on the dirty and often deadly streets of their childhood city to find those who were behind the murder. Very soon they discover that the robbery was a cover up for a hit murder. Someone wanted their mother dead and paid for her murder. Four brothers Mercer, Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), the leader, the oldest, toughest, short- tempered, and stubborn; Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin), the only family man of four who had taken care of the mother the last years; Angel (Tyres Gibson), the sexy one, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund), the youngest, whom three older brothers try to protect, are determined to avenge their mother's death no matter what it would cost. The film was directed by John Singleton as an urban thriller -revenge movie which is also a family drama, and I like it very much. It is violent, gritty, it moves well, it's got many plot turns on its way, it is packed with very effective dynamic action scenes, and acting is very good by all principal players. I was especially impressed by Chiwetel Ejiofor's turn as Victor Sweet, the pure evil despite his name. Ejifor said once, "I like to disappear into a role. I equate the success of it with a feeling of being chemically changed". The actor whom I first noticed in a compelling role of an illegal immigrant in London in the film Dirty Pretty Things (2002), was frightening in Four Brothers. I am also becoming a fan of Mark Wahlberg. He's got charisma and screen presence. The film does not fail to provide some humor, to show how much the four brothers mean to one another, and what the woman whom they lost meant to them. I missed the movie when it was released and actually did not know anything about it until this evening when its opening scene grabbed my attention; I began watching and did not leave until the credits started rolling.A bit of trivia: John Singleton is the youngest Oscar nominated director. He received the honors at the age of 24 after completing and releasing his directorial debut, the phenomenal Boyz n the Hood (1991) which was based on his own childhood in a LA ghetto. Where do you move if you start your career on such high note? Four Brothers may not be as great as Boyz n the Hood but it is a darn good and entertaining film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight and effective in a knock-about and fast moving sense, but do not assume it to be anything more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There was a time when John Singleton used to grab a camera and go out and shoot on the streets thus capturing where and what he knew best; capturing his life as he saw it or recalled it and delivering engaging stories detailing hope and tragedy all the same. Those days were round about 1991 and the result of all that documentation was Boyz in the Hood, a memorable and engaging debut film. Following numerous other films that don't really hit the spot came Four Brothers, and it seems all Singleton can do now is make genre pictures detailing scruffy clichés and the glorification of violence solving the problem, and it's sort of difficult not to enjoy it in a guilty manner.But only in a guilty manner. We enjoy films like Four Brothers because they're fast moving and the underlying theme of respect and honour to the family or family members is what keeps it in that humbling sense, never branching out into some out-and-out glorification of violence being the answer to violence. Of course Singleton is miles away from his post-Second-World-War-Italy inspired neo-realistic roots of grabbing a camera and shooting where you are and what you are for sake of a film, but so what? He knows it and after five minutes, so do we. Instead, Four Brothers is a pretty standard and pretty enjoyable revenge vehicle that gets across its kicks in a knock about fashion, establishing who's 'good' and who's 'bad' and who we should be rooting for and why we should be.I actually quite like the idea behind the set up and that is that a lone individual in Bobby Mercer (Wahlberg) returns home after a stretch away and sees everything differently to what it was before. The reason he was away has to do with being in prison a few times, it usually does in these films, and I like the idea of an individual coming back and seeing things through a new perspective. It actually reminded me of Neil Jordan's 1986 film Mona Lisa as his lead, played by Bob Hoskins, returns to a now Thatcher ruled Britain and sees everything different and for the worse since he'd been inside. But Bobby is a guy that refuses to accept that time can just move on with obligatory changes being a part of it all. Despite pleads from the police to allow them to do their job, the film branches off into a tale of the vigilante with Bobby and his three other brothers named Jeremiah (Benjamin); Jack (Hedlund) and Angel (Gibson) hunting for some killers.The reason for the pooling together of all these elements is to do with the four boys' mother named Evelyn (Flanagan), who was shot as part of a store robbery. The immediate act of throwing the audience into the cauldron by having the murder of an elderly, defenceless lady is a deliberate move by Singleton. By plunging us headfirst into a film that has no prior pleasantries or introductions bar the fact Evelyn was a nice and somewhat upstanding and understanding woman (she lets a kid off shoplifting) before mercilessly popping her off, results in the audience building up such a degree of hate towards the evil-doers that we may well allow anything to fly when the time comes. This is prolonged during the scene in which each brother sits around the dinner table and sees their mother while communicating to her in their own way emphasising she is gone and this may have happened many times in the past but never again.In this sense, it's quite manipulative of Singleton to attempt to try and get us to side with the vigilantes to this gross level as they wreck a nasty revenge culminating in a scene most revenge films would save for their finale. The film is a revenge picture of sorts with that nicely grooved cause and effect ideation behind it as they try to find the robbers/murderers but it's only for so long. Remember that nobody seems to be avenging the store clerk and I guess the brothers couldn't care less about the fact a store was knocked off in the process with all the distress that brings. When the film realises its delivered its finale after thirty or so minutes, it branches off into territory to do with corruption and betrayal when it emerges a large sum of money was involved in the insurance to do with Evelyn's death ? the film takes a detour down questioning one's loyalties.What escalates from here involves a local kingpin gangster named Victor Sweet (Ejiofor) who carries an overall message to do with something like 'if you ever find yourself achieving that level of power, do not abuse it' in the way he does by relying on favours and liabilities with your faithful subjects. A scene where he asks to 'borrow' his friend's wife soon before they're to be married sums this up best.I don't think Four Brothers is anything spectacular but its method of disguising vigilatism through dealing with it in the film's opening third before opening out into something else will not ensure the film is on most people's good side. It's as if they had to illegally hunt and kill someone in order to open up the bigger picture of corruption and this will not please everyone in its glorification. What it is, is tight mainstream entertainment that passes the time and on that level it works quite well in a dramatic and humbling sense.</fullReview>

Too much starts to come out about corrupt Detroit police, and elected local officials.

		<shortDescription>Singleton Still Has It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Years back I embarked on a story portrayed in a film called "Boyz In The Hood". One thing I have noticed about Singleton is he adds dimension to all the characters to the point you actually care about what becomes of them-especially when they die. In Four Brothers, it's Jack. Not much is said about Jack, except you just know that kid was sexual abused at the former foster homes he lived in, you know that until Evelyn Mercer took him in, he had nothing to call his own. And she healed him of that distrust. He is the most sensitive out of the brothers, or at least shows it the most. He is the youngest, and it is very obvious how the other brothers treat him that they consider him to be the most naive. Bobby is the oldest-even though we never establish his age, his presence gives off that vibe. Jerimiah and Angel are in the middle-Jerry seems to have gone straight, managing to have a normal existence. Angel has the least amount of background provided, however we learn that he has a girlfriend that he can never say no to, who the brothers (particularly Bobby) torment endlessly.Apparently Evelyn Mercer was a Social Worker, who tasked herself to place foster children into permanent homes. You get the feel that this woman didn't just place kids in a home and walk away, she cared for them all and you know she was the type to keep tabs on them. Everyone loved her, so when she is shot down in what appears to be a standard gang robbery shooting, people are upset-however it is treated as business as usual in the area of Detriot they are in. Bobby pretty much is a criminal, chances are he would have been far worse if not for this woman in his life, however he is pretty bad. He has a bizarre split personality thing going on, one moment he is tenderly introducing himself to his nieces, and another moment tossing various weapons to his adopted siblings to go and get to the bottom of what happened to their mom (although his affection and protective nature towards Jack is shown as he simply hands him a crow bar as opposed to a gun).Evelyn makes a powerful impression in the few minutes she is shown on screen. We first see her preventing a boy from stealing some candy from a sort of corner grocery store. She knows the man running the store, and he plays along with her to make an impression on this kid that makes you know he will probably not be stealing candy anytime soon. She points out that the kid needs a big brother-someone for guidance. Shortly afterword's, the store is robbed, and outside of the images the brother are seen remembering, we only hear about her.Eventually it is found out that Evelyn, essentially ,was assassinated. The boys eventually go out and find out why and by whom. In the process Jack is killed and in that moment I flashed back to Boyz N The Hood, where the neighborhood boys carry a bullet riddled Rickie back to his mother's home and they all are reacting to the senseless death. Bobby is not only crying for the loss of Jack, he is crying because you know somewhere along the line he probably promised Evelyn to always look out for his little brother. The man is a criminal, he is bad, callous and at times cruel, however he does have a level of a morals and you know that Evelyn was responsible for this.The movie is pretty violent. But in that respect, there is a sense of realism, as the area of Detroit this story is supposed to take place is considered very violent. It shows that vengeance does, indeed have a cost, and that in the end, there is always time to change your ways. The final image of Evelyn (who throughout the whole movie has been seen by all the brothers except Bobby)of her suggesting Bobby stay awhile gives the impression that indeed, Bobby will stay, and be a better person in her memory.Another thing to notice about this movie is the genuine way the actors all interact with each other. The teasing and poking fun at each other, the easy way all the interaction is developed really makes an impact. There is a moment in the movie when the brothers meet with Evelyn's lawyer and Jack casually asks "What do we get?" and Bobby smacks him behind the head. Chances are, it was improve, as Mark Wahlberg did a great deal of this in the movie,however the chemistry worked well and made the movie believable.I gave this a 9 out of 10, mostly due to the excess of violence.</fullReview>

Josh Charles, who has been acting since he was a child, plays an incredibly nasty, crooked cop and C. Ejifor plays the main bad guy. The icy showdown, which you probably have heard so much about, is so preposterous, it actually works. And there is a shootout at the boy's house that has to be seen to be believed. Put your brain on hold and enjoy the ride. Marky Mark may not be Brad Pitt or Matt Damon, but he proves here why is becoming the master of "B" action flicks.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the best revenge movies to have been released along with Man on Fire. It delivers all the action you could want, a great cast including Mark Wahlburg, Andre Benjamin and a perfect story and in my personal opinion it's one of Wahlburgs defining roles along with other films like The award winning Departed.As with all revenge movies, you need good strong characters to carry the weight of the story. This is a perfect example from Wahlburg, you also need a focused plot to which the characters follow. The direction has also been exceptional from John Singleton. This film exceeds in story and character. Buy this great DVD now, and you will not be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Personally... if you are a video-gamer like I am..... then you will see that it is based on the game Grand Theft Auto San Andreas.... example... Carl Johnson is in North California when down on the Mexico-San Diego borders his mother was shot up by gang-bangers.... he comes home to find his neighborhood up a crap-creek and him and his homies try to take it back while him and his and brother work to find out who killed his mom... Big Smoke... who I compare to Jeramiah, double crosses everyone and gives it to em' up the butt... now Jeramiah doesn't but it sure as hell looks like it.... their neighborhood gets shot up... they go on missions and rob people just like in this movie..... rent this movie.... its just like the 1st and last part of the video game .... the middle is in the country... It's kinda out there but pay attention and think and you'll see what I mean.. overall great movie, acting and storyline!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent movie, brought to life in today's modern times. However, I couldn't help but think how close this is to the John Wayne old western, Sons of Katie Elder. The four sons come back after their mother's death, to find out that their father was murdered. They seek the truth and get revenge. One of them is killed, but they still get their revenge. Still a great movie, just redone and refashioned after 40 years. Four brothers is well written, and keeps you watching every second. You truly feel for the boys and their mother's death keeps you in suspense. Mark Wahlberg does a great job of playing the tough guy, but still is able to lead his brothers and show intelligent planning and cunning to do the job. I recommend this to teens and above, language and violence is a bit tough for younger kids.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Four Brothers" is a solid revenge movie! There are quite a few action scenes that were impressive! The main actors are believable as adopted brothers! I do think they could have deepened their characters more! And show more of their relationship between each other! But still we know enough to care for them! The plot is not half bad but not real surprising! Except for the ridiculous showdown concerning the bad guy (an excellent Chiwetel Ejiofor)and Mark Wahlberg! I am not going to spoil it so don't worry! But just be prepared for it! (The clever Victor Sweet makes some unbelievable mistakes! This is done to a point that for me in the context of the movie is not acceptable and believable! I know that this is done for the ending we expect! But surely there would have been more options!) Overall the movie is very enjoyable and not too heavy! Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>sounds so familiar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey!! Isn't this "The Sons of Katie Elder"? Singleton wanted to give it a "Western feel." I think he did ...never have so many bodies been strewn around an urban area without the hint of a cop or nosy neighbor anywhere....automatic weapons used with impunity and nobody calls the cops? Even in Detroit?? Still, there is a kind of visceral fun to it. You have to admit it's probably the first time a car chase has been staged on an icy street and that is pretty exciting. The acting is uniformly pretty decent and the action sequences are staged well. The plot is just so convoluted and the clichés start to come fast and furious toward the end.</fullReview>

Time to avenge the woman the whole town loved.Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie but I'm less than a third of the way through it and suddenly it all seems too familiar! Only, with lots of colorful expletives and sex!! Not too original. The best part of the movie being the pretext of 4 adopted brothers from completely different worlds.I will say, Mark Wahlberg always makes me smile with his efforts to seem mean. He comes across as the angry but secretly a softy brother of the four. Isn't that what he does best?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That wasn't no gang shooting. That was an execution. They set Mom up. They set her up. " - Bobby</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's incredibly evident that the premise of 'Four Brothers' is anything but original and borderline silly. You can tell this just by watching the movie preview. John Singleton's (Boyz in the Hood, the remake of Shaft) new movie circles around a rather meaty subject in action films these days -- revenge. The story follows four foster children who grew up together; Bobby (Mark Wahlberg - Boogie Nights), Angel (Tyrese Gibson - 2 Fast 2 Furious), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin - Be Cool) and Jakc (Garrett Hedlund - Friday Night Lights). Although they have different skin tones (two are white, two are black) they still consider each other brothers because brotherhood goes deeper than 'the color of your skin'. After their step-mother gets gunned down at a local convenience store, they decide to take revenge -- BLOODY REVENGE. But how will it turn out? Four Brothers is very predictable, but quite entertaining for the most part. Some parts in it are so overly ridiculous you can't help but roll your eyes while other action sequences following the brothers' brand of street justice will have you cheering 'Get em'!" (not out loud, to yourself). A major flaw of the film is that although most of the time it doesn't try to be something it's not (groundbreaking, innovative, spectacular), it gets too melodramatic for it's own good, and that annoyed the hell out of me. There's enough action and bloodshed to entertain, but it unfortunately doesn't come along until twenty-five minutes into the film. 'Four Brothers' is a fun film with some major flaws. Barely Recommended. Grade: C+</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four brothers come back to Detroit to bury their mother. The 'brothers' were the four children that Evelyn Mercer could not find homes for during her years of working child protective services so she chose to raise them herself. Not exactly pillars of the community by certain better off than is they had been left to their own devices. But as they uncover to circumstances of her murder and the bodies point to a possible plot involving one of the brothers. Nothing but revenge will do and the streets will be covered in blood.'Four Brothers' is a good urban revenge flick that will surely please its intended crowd. Lots of gun-play and some humor pepper the film and sprinkle a tad of blaxploitation for good measure, a winning combo for sure. The acting is good with Mark Wahlberg heading up the brothers. The writing is solid with enough action to move quickly enough and even a few welcome twists here and there. John Singleton's direction is solid and is a return to form after some mixed outings ('Shaft') and tepid sequels ('2 Fast 2 Furious'). I still believe Singleton is one of the best black filmmakers in town and hope to see much more from him. The design is what it is, a down and dirty urban sprawl with all the nasty bits to go with. The music is surprisingly low key. Most urban flicks cover their inadequacies with loud, bassy rap songs by whoever's big at the time, which this has but it's not overwhelming and allows the score pop in and do it's thing.'Four Brothers' is a nice change. Many of the films today go for softer ratings and crossover appeal but thankfully that's not the case here. Acting: * * * (Very Good) Writing / Direction: * * * (Very Good) Technical Design: * * * (Very Good) Music: * * * (Very Good) - - - Overall: * * * (Very Good)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was by far one of the best movies i have seen. I grew up in the same neighborhood as Mark Wahlberg and I was surprised when he started acting. To tell you the truth I thought this was going to be a horrible movie, but i was wrong. I do think that Garrett Hedlund is very cute and was very happy to see him in this movie after Friday Night Lights. Anyway this movie is awesome. It's funny and it's sad at the same time. It almost seems like they are real brothers because of the way the portrayed their characters. Bobby was by far the best character in the movie. Bobby was the true older brother who stood up for his family and what he believed in which is always good in a character.There was one part in the movie where they show Garrett Hedlund getting out of the shower which was on of my favorite parts in the movie. Yes that was a good part but the movie as a whole was amazing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Done Drama With A Great Story and Good Performances</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Joe Cool Review: Four Brothers(2005)Starring:Mark Wahlberg as Bobby Mercer, Tyrese Gibson as Angel Mercer, Andre Benjamin as Jeremiah Mercer &amp; Garrett Hedlund as Jack MercerStory: Four adopted brothers come back home to bury their mother. They soon find out there's a lot more behind her death than they realize and begin to track down her killer. Opener: On one hand, I heard good things about this movie, and the trailer looked good. On the other, it seemed like another run of the mill murder/revenge story set in the bad streets of Detroit. So really I had no expectations either way going in. That was thanks in part to myself not seeing anything previously done by the director or most of the cast. They only one I had heard of was Mark Wahlberg, thanks mostly to Rock Star. So with no expectations going in, how did this movie do?The Good: Mark Wahlberg gives another good performance here. It might have seemed a little by-the-numbers at times but mostly he comes off as a good guy with a real mean streak. The other Mercer brothers(Gibson, Benjamin &amp; Hedlund) all did well in their roles as well, even if it appeared they didn't do much. The main part about their performances I liked was their chemistry with each other. They came off as real brothers. The story and I guess the direction was what hooked me the most. It was a very well produced movie.There were plot twists everywhere and when I thought one thing was going to happen, it didn't, and something completely different happened. It's a roller coaster to experience. One scene I really liked, that I thought was very well done was a shootout scene towards the last half of the movie. And when the movie ended there were no real plot holes, that's always good. Everything is tied up and all the twists end up serving some purpose. They're not just there to throw you off, unlike some movies I have seen in the past. The Bad: For as limited time as she was in there, I felt they could have had someone else play as Evelyn Mercer. Fionnula Flanagan was alright and everything her performance just seemed off to me. Also, while I did mention the great story and good acting, it did all seem by-the-numbers at times. It wasn't predictable, but it all had a feel of "I've seen this before". Maybe it's just because so many of these types of movies get released, I don't know. Also there were some things that could have been cut. For example, why have one person get suspected, just to have them not be involved in any way with what happens? Just didn't make any sense. The Ugly: Sofia Vergara annoyed the hell out of me as Sofi. Pretty sure her character was supposed to, but she over-acted everything to the point I groaned every time I saw her on screen. I hated that character. Also, what was up with the humiliation scene(you'll see)? I realize that's what that guy likes to do but it threw me off and didn't make any sense to leave it in. Final Verdict: Four Brothers was a very good movie, certainly not what I was expecting. A well-done drama with a great story and good performances. Check this one out if you can.Rating ***1/2 of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherhood and Revenge: A Study in Fighting Crime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton has a gift for depicting the gritty side of life and making it credible: there are reasons for heads-up defensive action in neighborhoods where perpetrators an victims live side by side in a world teetering on imbalance.FOUR BROTHERS is a finely tuned, taut little film that demonstrates the influence of a caring adult on kids with little future can impact lives. Evelyn Mercer (a terrific Fionnula Flanagan) is a single woman who adopted four orphans as children and raised them tightly bonded brothers: two are white (ex-con Bobby - Mark Wahlberg - and gay musician Jack - Garrett Hedlund: two are African American - (gentle Angel - Tyrese Gibson - and stay-at-home businessman Jeremiah - André Benjamin). The four brothers reunite when their mother is killed during a store holdup. Knowing that the Detroit police are a corrupt organization they take matters into their own hands, seeking out their mother's killers. Along the way they discover aspects of each other that draw them eventually even closer as brothers.The cast is excellent with fine cameo performances from Terrence Howard and Josh Charles as polar opposite policemen, from Flanagan (who though murdered in the first frames of the film reappears to 'spiritually' influence the brothers), Chiwetel Ejiofor as the bad guy, Tara P. Henson as Jeremiah's wife and Sofía Vergara as Angel's girlfriend. The story is solid if a bit predictable, but the messages are many about racism, brotherhood, family importance, and awareness of police corruption. Singleton directs with breakneck speed yet allows us time to get to know everyone in the story. This is a dandy action film with a heart. Grady Harp</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A modern remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An urban remake of the John Wayne western "The Sons of Katy Elder" from the 60's. Same basic plot line - good hearted woman raises four bad boys who come home after she dies to avenge her death. However the storyline in this version has more holes in it than a pound of swiss cheese, but considering the intended audience that probably doesn't matter. (Example, the brothers chase/shoot at/beat up various villains in broad daylight in Detriot on totally deserted streets. Has the city been abandoned?) Younger audiences will like the action and shoot 'em up scenes which tend to make the brothers' characters unsympathetic heroes. The dialog is laced with four letter words, so keep the kids away from this one. Some of the players in this movie simply cannot act - which actually lends a bit of realism to the film. You'll see this DVD in the bargain bin at Blockbuster within 6 months.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>very hard to believe this movie was done by the same guy who gave us boyz in the hood and this movie only supports the opinion he should have stopped then. It is extremely genre-confused. It is at the same time tooth-achingly sentimental and, supposedly, a spot on socio-portrayal of a Detroit community. It is Eminem goes to Disney (and this movie would hardly had been done if it wasn't for him). Four brothers, two white and two black, have their saintly all-too-goody foster mom killed by gangsters. After they discover that she was indeed targeted by these gangsters (i was never convinced why) they set out to set things straight - their way. well, actually they stumble through comedy, action and socio-drama in a plot that is way too orchestrated.John Singleton must be in dire need of a hit; he tried too hard but felt too little in this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A woman who had taken in and adopted four troubled youths (two white and two black) is murdered. The Four Brothers come together from different areas and want to find who did it.To be honest I originally thought the premise was a reach to get attention, and maybe there was some of that, but this was handled extremely well and I was impressed.The acting all around is very good. The story is more complicated than a simple murder of their mother and it unravels well. No one stands out, but that's okay. There isn't as much language as you might expect, but, of course, there is some. Everything moves along at a good pace and I was not bored at anytime. The car chase scene on snow and ice is pretty good.The most touching scene, for me, was the Thanksgiving Dinner the Four decide to make because that is what their mother would have wanted. It comes early in the story when you haven't made up your mind if you like any of them. Very touching.Yes, like a good juicy cheeseburger you have to have once in a while, this is a good shoot'em up that you have to watch once in a while.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Modern adaptation of Brothers Karamazov</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie, but the title drew me in. I think this modernized version of Dostoevsky's Brother's Karamazov is more moving and more direct, though less obvious, than Allen's Crimes and Misdemeanors, definitely producing more of the passion involved with the brothers and the strife created by their father (Sweet becomes Fyodor Karamozov, the tyrant/villain) than Allen can even approach (I believe Allen bites off more than anyone can chew, making one film from Crime and Punishment AND Brother's Karamazov, two entirely different and unrelated stories). The characters are not a direct match, but it is easy to see that Jeremiah becomes Ivan (this may be casting, André is the perfect Ivan), and Angel becomes Dimitri, which makes Sofí into Grushenka/Katerina, both the harlot and the betrothed, but the love triangle is only suggested by Sweet mentioning that he has a date with a Latino. The other two brothers are more difficult to place, though it is more likely that Bobby is Alyosha Karamazov (the novel's hero) and that leaves Jack to become Smerdyakov, (the illegitimate son), but this is also reversed because in the novel it is Smerdyakov that kills Fyodor, not Alyosha, but Smerdyakov also commits suicide. At any rate, I am sure there is a lot here in Four Brothers that will match with Doestoyevski's novel, but the subtlety and incorporated action and suspense makes this, IMHO, Singleton's best film yet.</fullReview>

So before much debate i decided (from reviews on this site) that deuce biggalo:European giggalo would be a waste of time and money.After deciding to see four brothers i knew that it is money well spent. I don't plan to give too much away but this film provides a strong sense of family love from 4 completely contrasting yet unduly close people. It is a film with little if no special effects yet fantastic fight scenes filled with courage, determination and wit.Overall this film originally seemed a mundane plot of four people out seeking revenge but when you go to see it, you will be pleasantly surprised.There is only one thing that drops this score to 8 and that is that you never find out why the killing took place and exactly who committed the killing, but still cracker of a film!</fullReview>

A number of things were left unexplained or presumed but maybe we were meant to get so caught up in the killings we didn't always require explanations from the good cop.We are led to believe the four brothers are very bad but they are clearly good people underneath. As a morality play (check the depth of the good cop/bad cop conversation in the pool table over a crooked cue and playing tough games) it's okay but ultimately doesn't really get into the characters because elements are thrown in unnecessarily to distract us.They largely only serve to spoil the concept of four "brothers" in spirit looking to avenge an injustice.</fullReview>

The delivery of lines is awesome, and had many in the theater laughing out loud, while the actors did a good job of pretending to be a band of brothers. They do a very good job of representing the brotherly love, with constant teasing yet looking after each other. Looks like it was shot on location, and adds a more real feeling to the movie. While it still has many of the unbelievable gunfights, some effort has been made to make it slightly more realistic. Overall a great action packed film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four adopted brothers return home to grieve after their mother is killed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie may not be an academy award winner, but it is worth seeing. Four Brothers is surprisingly heartwarming and not so surprisingly action-packed, the movie holds your attention in a way that a lot of other movies can't, and you find yourself truly invested in each brothers story. Although the plot is somewhat hazy at times, I still can't really recall why the hit was taken out on the mother, Singleton's use of different camera shots was cool and the action while somewhat unrestrained was also believable and attention grabbing. However what really stood out in this movie was the acting and chemistry between the four adopted brothers. Mark Walhberg's portrayal of Bobby Mercer, the eldest brother and leader of the group, is solid and he seemed a lot more comfortable in this role, like in I heart Huckabees, than in some of his earlier roles (i.e. fear). Andre Benjamin as the second oldest and family man, Jerry, was understated but affective all the same.Tyrese Gibson's performance is also great, Angel is the soldier boy returned home not only to grieve but also to rekindle an old spark and return to his slightly criminal-ish ways, and finally Jack, the youngest brother, B-class rock-star and frequent punchline of his brothers jokes, Garret Hedlund is really great in this role and is probably the most interesting emotionally to watch, as his character seems to have had the hardest childhood before being adopted. The family dynamic is amazing and is the reason this movie works, it never once in the course of this movie seem unrealistic or unnatural that these four are brothers, and the genuine affection, trust, and love that they have for one another is unquestionably and sometimes painfully realistic. This is a great all-round movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I expected this movie to be fun, but not particularly good. A basic shoot em up, blow em up, beat em up movie, the kind my little brother is very fond of. Don't get me wrong, that kind of movie has a place, but this film far exceeded my expectations. I'm not going to get into the complications of the plot, but suffice it to say that it's similar to a modern day "Sons of Katie Elder", involving an elderly neighborhood do gooder woman being killed in what appears to be a routine hold up, and her four adopted sons return home to seek revenge on her killer. The plot, while relatively interesting, and well pulled off, was not the main appeal of the film for me. It was the characters of the brothers that really pulled me in. Mark Whalbeg, who generally isn't my favorite actor, does a really good job as the oldest brother, Bobby. He manages to portray all the character's emotions- the anger, the grief, the need to be in control- but without losing the sense that this is a man who's had a hard life and who's made some mistakes. The scene of him breaking down privately in the bathroom was fantastic. Tyrsese Gibson plays the brother Angel, the ex marine, with an incredible amount of charisma, and Jackie, the youngest brother,a wanna-be rock star and former hustler, is played very well, with a perfect mix of vulnerability, naiveté,awe for his brothers and anger. The biggest surprise to me was the performance of Andre Benjamin (aka Andre 3000) who gave an incredibly nuanced performance as Jerimiah, the brother with the most to loose, a wife, kids and a job. His conflicted character, torn between love for his mother and brothers and responsibility for his wife and kids is amazingly well done. I wasn't expecting this. The best part of this movie is definitely the chemistry between the four actors playing the brothers. This is partly due to the actors and partly due to the crackling screenplay, which I think reflects the attitudes of siblings who grew up together perfectly. They constantly rag on each other, particularly on the baby, Jackie, including calling him sweetheart and "cracker jack". Angel and Jerimiah end up wrestling on the floor after Angel throws a piece of plastic at Jerri, with Bobby giving a running commentary the entire time. When Angel, Bobby and Jackie come across the shooters who killed their mother and execute them, Angel and Bobby keep Jackie back, trying to protect him. The best scene in the film is definitely the climactic shoot out at the brother's childhood home. Bobby's anger, Angel's cool assessment of the situation, Jerimiah's desperation, and Jackie's fear are all played incredibly well, and the chemistry between Jackie and Bobby at the end, when Jackie is shot and lays dying, is perfect. Definitely not a movie to see if you're not a fan of violence or if you get squeamish from a bit of harsh language, but, while it's a bit of far-fetched, though entertaining, plot, the characterizations are very real. A highly cool flick.</fullReview>

LL anyway the story was great and the way they caught the bad guys was smart. i would suggest going to see this movie!! although i am tired of seeing Garrett die in his films.... that's 2 out of 3 now that he has died in?!?!?!? i would like to see him live!! but anyway it was a really well scripted and it was good if you are looking for a typical macho man action film. I mean just seeing his butt was enough for me! although Andre 3000 needs to stick to his day job...singing.... but either than that i give it an eight out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Action/Revenge Film This Year</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four Brothers is by far, the most entertaining and emotional film of the year that I have seen. The performances are just simply awesome. Emotions are constantly felt through the film. What the brothers are feeling, so are you. The story centers around four men, Bobby(Mark Wahlberg), Jeremiah(Andre Benjamin), Angel(Tyrese Gibson), and Jackie(Garret Hudlund), adopted by a woman to get them off the streets. They see themselves as brothers, and are closely knit. However, they go their separate ways, and are again united once their mother is killed. Bobby wants answers, and revenge, and he gathers up the brothers to find them. What follows is a sequence of breathtaking action and performances that will keep you thinking and on the edge of your seat. Four Brothers is extremely entertaining. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, if a bit silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining farrago of macho clichés starts Mark Wahlberg as an ex-hockey goon/vague sort of criminal who, along with his three other adoptive brothers, comes back home to Detroit for his mother's funeral. They decide to poke around the circumstances surrounding her death and soon uncover a conspiracy revolving around a local kingpin. Loose remake of THE SONS OF KATIE ELDER is very predictable, ultimately, but takes a few interesting jogs getting to it's familiar destination. The winter season in Detroit is used well, and there's one classic , iconic shot of Wahlberg walking on a frozen lake. Mostly decent action, thankfully R rated and rather more realistic and less implausible than some of what we see nowadays. Wahlberg in particular is very believable as the roughneck.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to see this movie yesterday and it was better than I expect it to be. Mark Wahlberg(Bobby Mercer) is a great actor and he plays his character well. I thought all the actors were great but my favorite was Garrett Hedlund(Jack Mercer). He's so innocent and young. I think he was probably abused when he was little. I cried when he got killed. It was one of the saddest scenes. He was so hot...hotter than Mark Wahlberg. Tyrese(Angel Mercer) is perfect for the role of Angel and Andre (3000)Benjamin(Jeremiah Mercer) is the responsible one so he plays his character well. The chase scene is one of the intense scene i have ever saw. The soundtrack fits in with the movie. The Motown music fits perfectly with the Detroit setting. I can't wait to buy the DVD. I wouldn't recommend this movie for anyone under 14. It has a lot of violence and strong language but not that much sexual content. But it had a lot of funny scenes. I can't wait to see this movie again. I loved it!!!!!</fullReview>

I am not a fan of any of the actors, but I like them a lot better today. These are three hot heads and a wanna be (Jerry); who react naturally when something they love has been taken away.

		<fullReview>This movie had unexpected depth of characters and a script that was not "by the numbers." The characters' dialogue seems real enough and their parts were played with nuance and subtlety for the most part. The brothers showed genuine affection for each other without overdoing it. ***SPOILERS*** I especially appreciated how, after they had disabled the bad guys, they carried through and actually killed them without either of the now trite, politically correct methods of either saying something like, "You are/he is not worth it." and waiting for the cops, or the imminent danger angle where the beaten person comes up with a weapon and is killed in the nick of time, thereby allowing the hero to seem that much more heroic. Definitely a "guy" movie, but with heart and panache.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's a sequence not too far into "Four Brothers" that combines a decrepit apartment building, three of the brothers chasing a bad guy, staircases, an elevator, a 6-floor apartment, a long hallway, and two attack dogs (guns, too).John Singleton does such a great job creating suspense, moving the action along, making it exciting that the sequence should be used in film school to illustrate just what can be done with simple elements well used.Not a perfect movie, but Singleton and the cast are clearly experienced professionals succeeding in making a movie that works. Sure, four brothers avenging their mom's murder leads to Screen writing 101, all clichés all the time -- but "Four Brothers" is solid and fun to watch.Mark Wahlberg is the movie's star, and does an excellent job, but all four of the brothers add solid performances, as do Josh Charles and Terrence Howard as cops</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Must See!!, Surprising Twists make this a Can't-Miss-wish-for-a-sequel! (maybe called Three Brothers?)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow! This movie took my breath away, twisted it and threw it back at me in a mass of chaotic thrilling action. When my friends and I left the theater, we were so excited. Wahlberg definitely deserves an Oscar for his dramatic, riveting, and hilariously funny yet antithetical performance. How can someone who is so strong have such a soft side??The way the four brothers (now Three) were devoted to their mother was heartwarming. Yet, they backed down from no one, as evidenced by their stern intestinal fortitude against the evil Victor Sweet (who was not sweet at all).I must say, the toilet scene, was a Singleton masterpiece. It was one of several key scenes and direction that really show the cutting edge and unapologetic style, reminiscent of John Landis. What about that frozen lake scene? When have we seen such a battle out on the ice? Come on, only Singleton can come up with this stuff! And it blows the Coen brothers "Fargo" scenes, out of the ice water. Watching Mark Wahlberg walking on water (like Jesus?), saving humanity from itself was truly a depiction of cinematographic wonder.Also, the camera work from the inside of the car trunk draws the audience closer to the nether regions of the director's mind. Not since "Fargo" have we seen such a thrilling blizzard-drenched chase scene. The ferocity of the elements fused with the intensity of the scene, becoming one with the emotion of the chase. Separately, the elements work fine, but together, they blend ones taste for excitement to perfection much like a robust sundae dredged with hot fudge, nuts and whipped cream. The proverbial cherry on top is the flipping of the car. They could have just assassinated the antagonist (gang-style), but instead, they drew us into the depths. You must see this movie. I only wish the sequel would come out much sooner. Hooray for Singleton! He raised the bar to new, unheard of heights, higher than three-time world record breaker Isaac Bershette's latest sheath toss.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Singleton's assured direction takes on a wild and surprising ride in the streets of Detroit. The movie's principal characters are four brothers who lose a beloved mother figure and must deal with its consequences and the eventual aftermath of their own actions.The film has some of the best action pieces I have seen in the last year, along with some really good drama and good acting. Mark Whalberg has matured into a fine action character actor. It is always exciting to see Terrence Howard in a minor supporting role as one of the cops investigating the tragic death of the brothers' mother.The film is beautifully photographed and scored, reminding its audience of the "revenge" films of the early 70's. It's exciting, intelligent, and one could almost say, a pleasure to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a summer where certain movies underperformed(Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith and Batman Begins didn't live up to my expectations) there is always one or a couple of movies that come out and change your whole perception of the greatest summer movie to come out during a particular summer. "Four Brothers," directed by John Singleton(who made his mark 14 years ago with the critically-acclaimed urban hit "Boyz N the Hood") returns to his roots making another gritty tale, this time set on the mean streets of Detroit. Four Brothers(Wahlberg, Gibson, Benjamin and Hedlund) are all brought back together when they find out that there foster mother has just been murder. Not only do they go and look for the mother's killer but they also discover a world of corruption and scandal. I must say that each of the four brothers were cast perfectly and gave really good performances. What I also liked about this film is that they didn't try to make the characters be someone who they were not. After viewing this film, I would have to say that this is the second best movie I've seen this summer next to the blockbuster hit "War of the Worlds." "Four Brothers" is a must see and will surely not disappoint.</fullReview>

Mark Walberg did a great job and has come along ways since his days as marky mark. His acting has not only got better, but I think this one was his best performance. Tyrese Gibson, I love him as a singer and not that many can sing and act as good.I don't really know which I like better his acting or singing, his performance was so awesome I don't even know whether to say I liked Mark Walberg's or Tyrese better. The other two guys who plays the other brother also are amazing actors and couldn't of picked any better people to play brothers than all four of them. I do hope that they all become something better in acting or as for Tyrese in singing, but to tell you the truth after this movie he should consider his acting more than his singing.</fullReview>

The directing was solid, the story was interesting, the film itself however, played second fiddle to the superb acting of ODEEN ECCLESTON. I write her name all in capitals because her acting is so amazing that she cannot be compared to the mere mortal who has only two or three capitals in their name. Her portrayal of "gang member" couldn't have been more accurate unless she was wearing her ESC sweater. ODEEN!! she not only felt the character, she also shared an honest view to some, of what its like to be a struggling youth growing up in this upside down, work a day world. ODEEN!! The acting skill of this thespian moved me so much, that i gouged my eyes out of my skull because i never wanted to watch another movie again. If she ever stars in her own feature film, i will faction a pair of robot eyes, or have someone explain the movie to me in graphic detail. in retrospect, her acting moved mountains. I rated this movie a 9 out of 10 due to the fact that it lacked hours of odeen. ODEEN!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an outstanding action picture from start to finish. The movie is a hip-hop version of the 1965 western "The Sons of Katie Elder". I was very impressed by the chemistry between the four main actors. However, I wish that the movie could have explored each of the main characters more, but that would be asking for too much in the time period alloted. On the other hand the movie is made without the special effects that are becoming the norm in this era. By removing the special effects and concentrating on pure action the movie is reminiscent of the old action flicks of the 70's. This is one of John Singleton's best movies, although the most unheralded. The movie is the sleeper of the year!</fullReview>

Yes there was lots of action, more then I expected but the thing that really made me love this movie was the story. It was truly moving and I'm not afraid to admit that I cried at times. Unlike some action movies that think you can't have a story this one uses the drama and emotions to support the violence. So even though it is violent(and it IS VIOLENT) its not out of context. So this movie has it all,lots of action and drama. Over all I loved this movie. In fact I'm going to see it again because sometimes a movie can be good enough that you wont get tired of seeing it at the theater. This is definitely one of those movies.</fullReview>

The story becomes unpredictable! This was the first drama/action movies I have seen in theaters, and this one was great. Whats great also was the acting. You'd think Andre 3000 would suck at acting like all the singers-come-actors, but he proves you wrong. I was skeptical at first, there hasn't been a "good" John Singleton movie in a while, and i thought there will never be, but again, i got proved wrong.Obviously, this movie isn't for children, there is one gory scene (but I don't want to spoil it for you) and in the end, it was totally worth watching. There are parts that are funny and there are parts that make you want to cry. It really brings up emotions nicely. If you haven't seen it yet, I HIGHLY recommend you do, because it really is great, and probably more than what you expect (it was for me).</fullReview>

It definitely keeps you on the edge of your seat. The acting, writing and direction is tremendous. Low budget doesn't show - it's beautifully shot. The violence abounds - but Mark Walberg's character takes the focus of his mother's death and is unrelenting - i'm not sure how i'd feel in this situation - but Mark Walberg's character is unwavering.

When I saw the Trailer, I was a bit skeptical about the whole thing but Marky Mark gave me a reason to see it. I've enjoyed "Italian Job" and other movies he had been in so I had decided to check it out.The acting in this movie was impressive by each cast individual. The storyline was deep and expanding, branching off into different directions for each of the character.My favorite character, Jack had the most unique storyline of them all that left his past opened for pretty much any possibilities. Garrett Hedlund has a lot of potential and I hope to see him in more movies in the future.So in general, this movie had outdid itself more then I could imagine. Thougn no movie is never perfect, and this is no different, I gave it a high rating because I walked in feeling disappointed but came out satisfied instead of the other way around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Modern Take on a Classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four disparate, wayward brothers return home to bury their mother and find out why she died. That is the plot of John Singleton's new film, "Four Brothers." It is also the plot of Henry Hathaway's 1965 "The Sons of Katie Elder," starring John Wayne and Dean Martin. The new version stands on it's own: it's an extremely entertaining vendetta film about four young men who, despite their differing ethnic backgrounds, are obviously brothers. The love between them is palpable and that is what sets this film apart from others which may be as technically proficient as this one but lack it's humanizing element. The cast is great. Mark Wahlberg is in his element - I am now fully prepared to forgive him for "Planet of the Apes!" Andre Benjamin of Outkast is superb as the one brother who has, at least on the surface, "gotten it together" and has the most to lose. I saw this film a week after having seen "Hustle and Flow" (which was produced by John Singleton) and Terrence Howard is as commanding in this film as he was in the other. The man has star power.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Foster Sons of Mrs. Mercer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with how well the plot of the John Wayne classic western, The Sons of Katie Elder, was adopted to modern day Detroit. In the original film, Katie Elder is never seen, the sons arrive in Sweetwater, Texas for her funeral and find out about their dad Bass Elder who was an unsolved homicide. In this film Fionnula Flannagan has the mother role in the very beginning and we see her gunned down in a convenience store holdup. Or was there more to it than that?You KNOW there's more to it than that and like John Wayne and his brothers, Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund are going to not let things rest until they find out. Wahlberg steps very nicely into a modern day version of the Duke and the others fill out the parts that were played by Dean Martin, Earl Holliman, and Michael Anderson, Jr. back in the day.It's modern day stuff, but the classic scenes from the westerns are nicely adapted. I do like the way the famous scene of the ambush of the Elder brothers is staged in modern Detroit. As those of us who remember the original, one of the brothers doesn't survive. I will say it's a poignantly played death scene.I do wonder if back in the days when Mark Wahlberg was a real life urban hoodlum in the making, did he have any idea he would be playing a John Wayne part on the silver screen? Life can take some funny turns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was so excellent. I saw it for the first time about three weeks ago, and from the moment I saw it, I knew it was one that I wanted to get. Mark Wahlberg does an excellent job, like usual. Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garrett Hedlund add that much more to the movie. The story isn't at all far-fetched either. There are two gunmen, and they run into a little mom and pop grocery store, ambush the cashier, murder him, and then they kill these four guys' mother, and the four want to know who. So they go looking for vengeance. It is definitely something I would do if my mother was murdered in cold blood the way that the guys' mother was killed. I searched over and over for this movie from the first time I saw it. Five stores, and nearly three weeks later, I found it, and I am sure glad that I got this movie as it is one of the best I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers is a movie that I watched with my family. It was a great movie. It taught me that gangs aren't all bad and that some are just trying to find answers. This movie was definitely a tear jerker. Garrett Hedlund played an amazing role as Jack in this movie. He played the youngest kid who had a rough life growing up which had scared him for life. Hedlund made viewers believe the role he was playing and made us feel bad and thats the feeling you should get while watching any movie like this. The best scene was the one towards the end when the bad guys try to kill all of the brothers by shooting up the house. It was definitely a twist to the whole scene when the guy came to the door and Jack went after him. That was the saddest part of the whole movie. But I would highly recommend watching this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wham-bam male drama at its best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton, the director of such acclaimed films as Rosewood and Boyz n the Hood, brings us FOUR BROTHERS. Four men, from different races and backgrounds, are raised under one roof by a very strong and determined foster mother who cares for them and gives them a real home. On a cold, dark wintry night in Detroit she stops by a small convenience store to pick up a few things, and is murdered when it is held up by two armed men, wearing masks. The four men, having developed a bond as tight as true brothers growing up, come back home to lay their mother to rest. In the house, the memories come back. After the police seem to be getting nowhere with the case, the brothers take it into their own hands to avenge the death of the woman they knew as mother. The four brothers are played by Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin (from musical group Outkast), and Garrett Hedlund. Terrence Howard plays the detective intent on bringing justice to the victim in this case, but also not wanting any interference from the men. But the more the four brothers dig, the fishier their mother's murder gets, and there is no turning back. Filled with explosive action scenes, from icy car chases to raw emotion and street justice, this film is powerful in-your-face, wham-bam male drama at its best! Thrilling and funny - an action film with heart and a great story. I really loved this movie. I sat down to watch it with a cup of coffee, and I barely could take two sips. I was drawn in that much. Everyone can rally around these brothers that are 'gonna work it out.' To cap off the appeal of this movie is the awesome Motown soundtrack featuring Marvin Gaye and the Temptations, among others. Four Brothers is a winner all around. This movie is rated R.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another hit from Singleton.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Brothers" (2005), the latest film from acclaimed Oscar-nominated director John Singleton, is another hit for him. About 4 adopted brothers who avenge their caring and kind mother's death, this film soon turns out to be more complicated than it actually is (due to a very sharp script and dialogue). The acting is top-notch from our cast, including Mark Wahlberg as one of the brothers, Bobby Mercer. Also of note, though her role was minimal, is the mother herself, Fionnula Flanagan as Evelyn Mercer (I first enjoyed her performance as Data's mother in the 1993 "Star Trek: The Next Generation" TV series episode "Inheritance"). The camera work is also top-notch here, showing the gritty reality of Detroit. All in all, a high 8 out of 10. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>9 or 10? What A Tear Jerker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think it's safe to say that Jack Mercer's death is the most tear jerking, on screen death since Bruce Willis in Armegeddon. I can't stand it when I watch a film, get really attached to a character (Garrett Hedlund as Jack Mercer) and then they just die. I was intending to give the film a 10 without question but I just had to deduct a point because of Garret Hedlund's and Terrence Howard's shock executions. Besides that I have to give massive props to Mark Whalberg for finally learning how to act and Andre Benjamin for being such a straight up gangster! Funniest Moment; When Tyrese Gibson gives that fat kid a box of Baby Ruth's to do a favour for him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was fabulous! Mark Wahlberg did a great job, I think. All of them did. The new-comer, Garrett Hedlund, did a FANTASTIC job in this movie. If you don't know who he is, you really need to see this movie! He is so talented, and he does a brilliant job when he gets shot. He does such a good job at it. Mark Wahlberg did a great job as well. It just really seemed like they were all true brothers. They all just worked so well together on screen. I just really enjoyed this movie all around. This isn't the movie that you would want to take the kids to see, though. It has a lot of violence in it, but other than that it's O.K. If you saw Tyrese Gibson in Waist Deep, you will enjoy his performance in this movie. They all did a perfect job. I hope they get together again and do another movie!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watch a lot of movies and only a few of them actually make me feel something. this movie is great and is anything but a waste of time. the writers do an excellent job of setting you up to care about the characters. this movie is filled with intense action and violence, but the best is how all the brothers work together and at the end it all comes together beautifully. the only thing i really had to complain about was how the brothers all hated the killers responsible for their mother's death, yet throughout the movie, they did nothing but become ruthless killers themselves. i guess sometimes revenge can mean becoming your worst enemy. this movie will make anyone want to tap into their barbaric impulses and i strongly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I rented this movie, I had low expectations. It looked like a fun little movie to enjoy and thats it, nothing fancy. Also I expected Mark Walburg to carry to movie, which he did , but what surprised me is that he didn't have to. He carried it, not cause others were lacking but his performance was just that good. I expected nothing out of Andre 3000 since he was in music, and less out of Tyreese because he was poor in 2 Fast 2 Furious and I had never heard of the actor who played Jack. I am pleased to tell you I was surprised in a good way with all three men. Andre could definitely go onto more acting without any hang ups about him being in music, Tyreese made me forget 2 Fast 2 Furious and love this movie instead, and the future looks bright for the actor who played Jack, whos name I can not remember. The story was good although sometimes confusing, but it was all around a good movie and should have done better and John Singleton should have been awarded for his efforts. Go see this movie</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pleasantly Surprsing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I have never been a die hard fan of action movies. Nothing against them, but they have just never really interested me, in so many action movies when there is a high speed car chase or a shoot out I just kind of get confused and go "so who's shooting who." So when at first I saw the commercials for the this movie I could not help but go, "Damn, this looks pretty dumb".My opinion was completely turned around just a few hours ago though, when I had nothing to do and decided to watch this movie (which was airing on one of the movie channels). Bracing myself for a stupid script and confusing shoot outs I started off with low expectations.Boy were my expectations wrong.Now this movie isn't the greatest movie in the world, but there is no doubt that it is good. I'm not sure how to describe this, but for me it seemed as if this was an action movie with substance - with a core. It wasn't just about revenge and killing off murderers, it was about four brothers who have such a strong bond - now that may sound cheesy, but you can ask anyone and it's true. This movie is an action movie no doubt, but at the centre of it is actually quite an emotional story.Throughout the movie though there is still a lot of action, good car chases, exciting shoot outs etc. Yet I seemed to enjoy them just because you really knew why there was so much fighting. Not in lots of dumb action films where there is just mindless shooting and killing.Besides that, I will say that the acting also pleasantly surprised me. Mark Wahlberg (who, no offense, I have never had too much respect for) really shocked me in this movie, he played his character really well. So well in fact that the character almost became real to me. Same with all the other brothers (Benjamin, Gibson and Hedlund), I really actually believed their characters. I think that that is when you know that it's a good movie - you truly believe that the characters are real people.So in the end, I will say that it is a good film and definitely worth a watch. It's got action scenes for the guys, and an emotional core for the rest of it.My two main complaints about this movie? 1. There were a lot of questions I thought up of during the movie which were never answered (for example, whenever Bobby or Angel are beating up people, Jack always get this really almost child like scared face on his expression. I would have really loved to know why he was so... afraid of hurting some people) 2. On occasion the characters seemed to be portrayed as being just as ruthless as their opponents, perhaps this was on purpose but after that I couldn't help but dislike the four brothers slightly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had high hopes for this movie when I first wanted to see it. And I didn't get to see it until about 8 months later, after I borrowed it from a friend. Now, I know like any other action movie-goer, I wanted a GOOD action movie with a brain and not just mindless slaughtering. This movie did an excellent job of putting both together in a satisfying way, but took the mindless out of anything. The mixed emotions one gets from this movie is spectacular, and you don't realize how much emotion there was until after you see the movie. One scene you'll be laughing, perplexed, fixated, angry...and the next, you'll be sad, crying, happy, and just overall cheering for a movie about four brothers trying to bite their mom's killer in the --metaphorical--ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent for All!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In a world of dumb "frat pack" movies and predictable chick flicks, "Four Brothers" is an excellent find.I thought the performances given by all lead actors were fantastic. Mark Wahlberg is often underrated, and he gives a fabulous performance as the oldest brother, Bobby. Andre Benjamin was solid in his big film debut, and Tyrese did a surprisingly good job. However, the best by far goes to Garrett Hedlund, the almost-rocker who is constantly teased by his protective older brothers. The supporting cast were all fantastic as well.There is a lot of profanity and violence, but in reality, it is necessary for the situation. Although some parts may not be totally believable, you'll laugh and probably cry at the quick dialogue and surprising "twists".It is all complimented by a good soundtrack. I would recommend this movie to anybody (over the age of 14, however)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very nice break in the murder mystery parade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a very rich story. It is rich because of its complicated and engrossing plot. It has fascinating and appealing characters. And finally the setting in Detroit at the beginning of winter gives it a kind of drama that it could not have anywhere else. The premise of four adopted brothers both black and white might have made it into a tedious parable, but it never submits to this temptation. Race is always an issue, but it is always as realistic as possible and never drifts into false sentimentality.Actually, poverty and mean streets are explored more in this movie than race. These are huge equalizers among our characters who have the good fortune of falling under the care of knowledgeable woman who raises them to maturity. We do not see this, our movie starts when this woman is murdered and the four brother return to her funeral. They have been made better by their experience with this adopted mother, but largely remain bound by the streets that gave them birth. And so, one by one, they return to the streets to find out what happened.If the movie has any flaws, it is how the plot develops here. It drifts into the implausible and sensational and is only saved by the well developed characters.</fullReview>

It taught me not to judge the book by the cover. Take a chance &amp; experience Four Brothers for yourself &amp; you'll find family love is indeed color blind .. as it should be.

		<fullReview>I knew little or nothing about this movie before I went to it, but it captured my attention immediately. The characters of the four brothers, obnoxious, violent and ruthless though they are in turn, are appealing from the very beginning. Mark Wahlberg is on superb form in this movie, and Garrett Hedlund, as the abused youngest brother, is amazing. The jokes are well timed and balance the serious stuff very well. Apart from anything else, this is a very good murder mystery, with twists and turns all the way. Although the cast is made up of relatively unknown actors, they each play their parts to perfection. There are some brilliant stunts as well. The brothers work well together, and are perfectly believable as a real, misfit family. Fionnuala Flanagan, who appears at intervals throughout the film, adds a softer touch to a film that could otherwise have gone too far down the route of gangsters for it to be believable. No loose ends were left, it was tightly written, and the perfect length. 10 out of ten</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tries too hard to be clever, and loses the audience as a result</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While we clearly don't need another remake, I would be lying if I said this movie didn't make one hell of a try to be good.Based very similarly on the John Wayne Western The Sons of Katie Elder, the film plays off as a modern urban western. The characters don't wear cowboy hats, but as they walk into different establishments looking for trouble, you can't help but imagine them walking into places from the Old West. Hell, some of the sequences involving guns look like highly stylized shots from Westerns, just with an undeniably 2006 Urban-street outlook. There's even the inevitable final showdown that we've seen done all too many times.The cast is off and on throughout the picture. Mark Wahlberg tries his best, but for a tough hard-ass, I think he cries a touch too much. Humanizing this monster could have been done in a number of other ways. Whereas Tyrese Gibson looks fairly comfy in his role, Andre Benjamin is totally miscast. Garrett Hedlund is given not nearly enough material to contend with the other three, so it's hard to say whether or not he pulled his role off well enough. Terrence Howard is there, and as always, tries to outshine, but isn't given the time to exercise his acting muscle, or show off the feelings he did in Crash or Hustle &amp; Flow. The man was nominated for an Oscar after all. The rest of the cast is throwaway, and are either used barely, or not nearly enough. The film is about the brothers, but if you want to introduce characters 45-60 minutes into a 120 minute film, at least flesh them out enough for us to care about their introduction.The storyline flows wonderfully through the first hour. It hooks you, and keeps you hooked until you attempt to continue getting into the film. Then, it loses all of its appeal, and just slowly declines. Where in one scene, the brothers are heartbroken and shaken up, another just like it is thrown away as if it is nothing. The film makes us try our best, despite some rather violent sequences, to think of these guys as men who care about the wellbeing of their family. But scenes like these (and there are a few), just make us toy with our viewpoint, and see them as egotistical monsters out for just themselves and not giving a damn about anyone else. These scenes completely jerk the audience around, and it is totally unclear what John Singleton wants us to feel for these guys by the end.And as the film continues to its eventual finale, it just tries way too hard to be clever and totally falls apart as a result. It just toys with the audience a little too much, and you lose any interest you had in the film up to those minutes where it takes a sharp turn that it never recovers from. It feels like a total waste in the end. It's unfair, but if you're going to watch a film like this, you can't expect any less.A good polish of the script, and maybe a few characters being forced out of the screenplay could have only improved this film to stand independent away from Katie Elder. Instead, yet another urban feeling movie, swings and falters to its inevitable conclusion, and loses its audience as a result. And they wonder why Urban films aren't taken seriously? 7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A well made film with some good scenes and acting but... it just didn't tie together well enough. Had a very good Motown soundtrack that was well fitted into the scenes. I believed in the characters but found the foster mother almost sickly sweet, and the flashbacks where she was sitting at the table annoying. When suspicion fell on the older brother it started to get interesting, but then the suspicions were dropped almost instantly - which was hard to believe. I did enjoy seeing a film set in a non typical (movie) US city (detroit) though.Of course I wasn't expecting something deep, I was looking for an entertaining film with a few explosions - but disappointingly at the end of the day I just couldn't get interested. This is a rent - but wait till its off new release film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>just OK</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching this movie I saw the last four episodes of 'The Shield' season one. Perhaps that spoiled me. This film is just OK, no more. Some of the scenes are unintentionally humorous: Bad guys take forever shooting up the mom's old house with fully-automatic weapons, the brothers defend with shotguns,magnums and 45s. Rock star bro is screaming incessantly after getting shot. It sounds like WWIII. Aside from that, seems like a quiet, well-kept-up neighborhood. Where are the police? To make this even worse, after it's all over, one brother yells out:"Somebody call 911!". Ya think? How about when Marky Mark holds a gun on the -crowd- at a basketball game? Why not give these guys the power to fly and see through walls? Singleton seems to know that there are huge gaps in the tension, which he artificially tries to pick up with way too many gay put downs between the heroes, to the point that I wanted at least one of them to admit that he -was- gay, but no, it was just good fun, (although not for the viewer).The cast is good, and a couple of things are explained well enough, so 5 stars instead of maybe two.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Took time to introduce characters at the start and then got to the real point of this movie... "Burying their mother... and her killer."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My dad one night brought home two movies he borrowed from a friend (who wants to start a movie store and buys all the newest movies)... Brothers Grimm, and Four Brothers. Personally, I wanted to watch The Brothers Grimm... I had seen the previews and thought it would be awesome. Instead, we watched Four Brothers first. I was at first groaning, because I knew what it was about, and I knew it would be decent, but I thought this was a movie to be watched when the satellite went out. I was actually surprised.The directors wasted no time whatsoever in getting directly to the killing of Evelyn Mercer... now most movies would have talked about her raising these four brothers, perhaps even when they left. I suppose for those who were confused about characters, that would have been good. Instead, they creatively at the start had the characters laid out in front of us. It all started at the funeral, where in the deleted scenes they had the brothers give a Eulogy. A scene I think would have done the film well to be kept, but wasn't. In this scene, first Jeremiah went up to say a few words about their mother, and then Jack did. He mentioned how their mother took him in, talked about it, but got too emotional.To introduce us at the start to the characters, they decided to let Green tell Fowler about the Mercer's. Bobby, the heavy-weight champion screw up (replacing what he actually said with a more appropriate word), Jack, the first class screw up, third class rocker, and Jeremiah, who was the rising star of the bunch but found a cause. This gives us a little background, and the file he showed Fowler about Bobby is filled with lots of paper, so we know then that Bobby has had a lot of run ins with the law.The director and everyone who contributed to this movie knew one thing... things were going to change soon enough. Soon they'd be shooting first and asking questions later, and they'd be focusing on finding their mothers killer. So instead of having things action packed from the start, the directors tried to show us a side of the brothers that later we wouldn't see. They showed us that these brothers were close, and whether brothers by blood or not, they were there for each other. Bobby, who's typically the one who comes off all tough, has his own emotional moment when he's crying about his mother. Whoever said the characters weren't really talked about a lot, didn't pay attention to the movie.So they share their moments after the funeral, and then its time for Thanksgiving Dinner. We learn here that Jack is a bit of a cook, and that the brothers really like Hockey. Now I saw it mentioned how in Detroit it would be more likely for them to play Basketball than hockey. I'd like to point out that this movie was filmed in Toronto, and hockey is huge in Canada even though our sport is technically lacrosse, so its possible that they were just going by that. And as for the people playing hockey, if you notice it is the director who is playing goalie which in one of the special features it shows the cast and crew playing a good old game of hockey. Each brother, other than Bobby, sees a different memory of their mother, showing us a bit of what was probably said in their childhood. Jeremiah being told by the memory of his mother to close his mouth, Angel being told by the memory to keep his elbows off the table, and Jack being told he was safe. The hockey game shows us a little fun side of the brothers, and then things start to get more serious.The brothers are seeking revenge, trying to find out who killed their mother, someone who was kind and sweet and wasn't the type to have enemies. Okay, so granted, they made a few bad decisions in the start, by just 'winging it' but they didn't care how they got revenge, just that they did. Bobby in particular has a huge criminal record, so he's not one to think seriously about something like this. You can say all you want that they seemed to lighthearted considering what they were set out to do, but you need to keep in mind that Jeremiah disapproved of it, and he was really the only one we can officially say had straightened out. The others were all screw ups still. Criminals, in general, are always light hearted. If its something you've done before, then your not going to sit up at night and cry because you killed someone. Your just going to act as if it never really happened. In these brothers eyes, each person they killed got what they deserved. Men in general don't usually like showing emotions, particularly crying or talking about how they feel. Of course that is a stereotype and isn't always the case, but in this movie, talking about how one feels about what their doing is just out of the question. We don't really know that these brothers didn't feel guilty about what they did, because it could have simply been an act for their brothers. We know Jack didn't want them to kill people, and Jerry stays out of this entirely when it involves gangs until after Jack gets shot basically. Then he stands up and kills someone to save Bobby.Overall I thought this movie was good. If the majority of people like this movie, that doesn't mean you will, and vice versa. So you decide if the movie sounds interesting, rent it, watch it, if you really like it, then buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... this movie somehow never delivers on-screen. Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, André Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund play the four Mercer brothers, reunited when their adoptive mother is gunned-down. The film focuses on their attempt to find out who she was killed by and why. Unfortunately, the plot is entirely too predictable, Mark Wahlberg plays the same old "too tough / too quiet" role that he has come to be typecast in, and the rest of the cast fail to deliver (blame that mostly on lame dialogue that leaves them looking uncomfortable) and there is no real believability in the roles. This movie does have one good car chase scene, and enough shoot-em up action to at least make it interesting enough for the action / violence film aficionado, but just rent it... it is not worth the cost of buying the DVD.</fullReview>

If you think that shooting indiscriminately, and waving guns in people's faces is a laugh then by all means buy a ticket. If you feel that glibness with regard to the misery of other human beings is what the world needs more of then invite some friends to join you. If you think that distinct depictions of the upside down hoodlum style of ethics is noble than this picture should be in the running come Oscar time!But, if you are revolted by the idea that might makes right, and you believe that violence begets violence, and that films should aspire to embody hopefulness and suggest some difference between the evil that people do and the ideals that they might live up to doing, then this film would be a waist of some come quality acting talent in the four lead actors, who portray the lead characters in this movie. Some distinctly two dimensional supporting characters and some occasions of distinctly inane dialogue and situations, as well as two dimensional acting by supporting characters -significant exceptions the foster mother and the bad cop- leave this a movie to steer very clear of watching: Unless you want to recruit gang-bangers for your street gang.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gritty and amazing!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sometimes the odd film makes even the most mediocre or in some cases poor actors/actresses do a good job. It's either incredible story telling, direction or a supporting cast or in this case all three. Mark Wahlberg from what I have seen of him has never been an impressive actor. The closest he came to being adequate was 1996's Fear. In Four Brothers he turns in an actual amazing performance as the lead character and "brother" Bobby Mercer. His character is gritty, mean, angry, emotional, and in my opinion a completely Oscar worthy performance which is really saying something considering I think the guy has been horrible up until now.Perhaps this can all be attributed to the brilliant story, written by David Elliot and newcomer Paul Lovett. Four Brothers is done in such a gritty street style with no real heroes but a host of cold, harsh anti heroes. The Mercer brothers are film characters of the highest order. They will be remembered in my book for a long time. Their violent nature and their form of brutal "justice" makes their style very controversial but still makes you want to root for them. Director John Singleton creates a dark setting of urban/gang warfare and also creates a thrilling and suspenseful mystery around the murder of the boy's adoptive mother. The four of them seem like such unlikely team mates and brothers but they are family in every sense of the word. Each actor who portrays a brother does it brilliantly in particular Wahlberg's character and Tyrese Gibson who plays Angel Mercer. Although all the characters follow Wahlberg's as their leader Angel stands out as having a mind and personality of his own.Four Brothers could have been downright violent but it wasn't over the top or malicious in content. Everything that existed in it was necessary but still a nicely violent film. Full of action, and a great storyline with some incredible acting. You really can't go wrong and I hope this film gets a lot of recognition beyond the box office and sticks around because it's one of the best I have seen in awhile. There are some genuinely great films to see in the theater right now and this is one of them. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent 'hood movie from Singelton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Put away your "toys", the Mercer boys are on the prowl to find out who killed their "mother" in Detroit city. The four actors who played "the Brothers Mercer" in got in your face from the start and stayed there until mission accomplished. Well crafted, well done and the characters just crackle with excitement on the screen. A remake of John Wayne's "The Sons of Katie Elder" is no ordinary western here in Motown but the revenge mode is still alive and kicking. A lot of shooting but no bodies exploding. For those of us who have lived in Detroit, a mid-afternoon shot out with no police presence was just the proper end to a Piston's game. The actors gave the movie its life and their interaction provided the needed adrenalin. Director Singelton hit a home run with this movie and the ensemble cast produced the needed fire and warmth. The police had crooks and good guys and the local politicans were scum bags but the "good" guys win out. The plot twists at the end were really simple but totally unexpected. Some of the dialogue is raw but hey, this is Detroit City and Bobby Mercer only asks questions "once." A real enjoyable movie for a lazy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie was great. I had no problems keeping up with the plot. The camera work was great. The characters(4 brothers) themselves each had complicated personalities. I liked that. The supporting cast was marvelous. From the dirty cop to victor sweet. Action galore. I felt like this movie was somewhat influenced on real street life, versus much of the hip hop garbage we see on TV. Mark whalberg did it for me in this movie. A little short brawler with a quick fuse that would not take any crap. So all in all this movie has actually set a new standard. To bad they had to kill off the youngest brother to do it. I give it 4 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this is probably one of the best movies I've seen this year. It was incredibly well written, filmed and acted. There is great chemistry between all characters. The movie isn't all dark...there are nice "warm" parts to it as well as great humor, and incredible sadness. Great plot twists, and an interesting story all-together. It was so well acted that although you know the brothers aren't exactly upstanding citizens you find yourself rooting for them to really get to the bottom of what happened and get the true scum. There is a lot of violence and swearing, but it doesn't take away from the movie. It seems to be very well placed and appropriate. Be sure to stay to watch the credits of the movie...there are little things at the end there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was brilliant... the acting was so real, all the characters were portrayed so well, especially Mark Wahlberg (as Bobby Mercer) and Garrett Hedlund (as Jack Mercer), all the brothers stand by each other through terrible events that happen in their lives. I thought you were only suppose to cry at chick flicks... this movie made me cry and few others in the Theater too, it really wrenches at your heart strings because the movie is real to life... to think stuff like this actually happens on the streets of our City's, that is what is so sad and it really makes you think during and after the movie. I would go see it again just coz it's got Mark Wahlberg and Garrett Hedlund :-) but also I would see it again because of the story line and the acting. Some people may not like it and say that it's just like the rest of the movies out there... but you get into the movie and you are right there with them going through all their ups and downs... go see for yourself and you will see what I mean.</fullReview>

I think that its a awesome movie, and would recommend it to absolutely anyone. It shows that family, is not the color of your skin, related by blood or not, that your a family, and that the bond that you can have with someone thats not your actually brother or mother, doesn't matter.

		<shortDescription>A great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the movie the day it came out, and I thought it was great. The plot was strong, and there were no slow parts in the movie, it just kept moving along. The acting was very good, and I especially liked Garrett Hedlund, who played Jack Mercer, the youngest brother. He was also in "Friday Night Lights" and "Troy", and we will definitely be seeing more of him in the future. There was a ton of action, so that was a plus for me. It was all very well planned out, and it reminded me (as many people are saying) of the old Westerns. Although it is a very serious movie, parts of it have a lot of humor. Of course, all of the brothers like to pick on Jack, the youngest, by cracking jokes and doing many other things that I can't describe. A warning though: it was extremely violent, crude, and graphic, and it NOT for kids. It was also extremely sad in some parts, and I had tears in my eyes. I NEVER cry at movies, so it must be extremely sad at some points. Overall though, it was very good, and when this comes out on DVD, I will be first in line to buy it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good revenge movie. Great action, surprising twists and genuinely funny moments. Loved the brotherly banter between the lead actors and felt for them when one is murdered. Great action scenes, the car chase in the snow storm and the raid on the brothers home were the highlights. Good acting all around (although I thought the woman playing the mother had too many cheesy lines and moments). Andre Benjamin was showing pretty good potential as the brother who just wants to let things go but is also harboring a pretty important secret. Markie Mark was playing a more bad ass ex gangster version of....well Markie Mark. Tyreese improved his acting skills since his horrible showing in 2 Fast 2 Furious, which that isn't a major feat but he did a good job. Bottom line it's a complete movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was great.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately if you're looking for an in depth review, you wont find it in here. I am in no way a good writer. I do have one thing to say......that movie was OFF the CHAINNNNNNNNNN. For the uninitiated, that means that it was a really great movie. Everyone in the theatre i saw it in agrees with me. I'm surprised that 2 rappers, an R&amp;b artist, and a guy that has only done 2 movies, did such a great job in this movie. Honestly i'm no movie critic, i just like to watch movies and this has got to be the best movie i've seen this year. It was chock full of action from beginning to end, Mark Walbergh did an excellent job of playing a hot head, you can feel his blood boiling when he gets angry. Tyrese also does a good job being the 2nd angriest but more rational brother. Andre Benjamin is the peaceful one who doesn't want any trouble unless you put his family in danger(when you see you'll know, but that isn't a spoiler...trust me i wouldn't do that to you). Garret hedlund, does a great job as the youngest brother who they affectionately call their sister, lol, he's the kid who wants to go along but they always tell him to stay back, but he does a very good job nonetheless. These actors did a great job establishing the love they had for their mother and each other. I felt their pain, their anger, and their happiness. And there are enough jokes, not too many, but just enough to give you a good laugh and keep the action going. All in all if you look at the comments i've posted, you will see how much i liked this movie, because i haven't commented on any other movie....i think. But anyways it was easily worth the 9.75 i paid for it. IF it cost 40$ and i knew it would be this good, i'd go see it twice.</fullReview>

There are some hilarious lines in this movie that need to be put up in the quotes section because everyone was laughing during the movie. The movie isn't very deep but it's amusing to watch if you don't mind watching violence. Lots of shootings but it's worth seeing.

		<shortDescription>Good revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton proves himself once again even if it is in the form of a revenge flick. I thought I was going into a simple plot revenge film using the classic design but much like a lot of revenge flicks lately(Kill Bill as one) this one had a lot more plot and surprisingly good performances. The soundtrack was classic Motown to go along the Detroit backdrop and at the same time giving the feel of the classic Soul Cinema that inspired Singleton. Though some of the lead characters are white, the fact that the family is a mixed family in predominantly black Detroit is like Singleton's message about the changing times. The movie is pretty violently and there isn't many positive female roles in the film except for the little we learn about the mother through her "appearances". If we had a little more exposure to her in the beginning of the film, maybe showing her with younger versions of her sons, it'd make the audience care that much more. But that's nit-picking, the film will satisfy anyone who wants a good revenge film with a decent plot. All the performances are strong and Andre Benjamin does well in his first big role. Singleton has a knack for taking musicians and turning them into great actors.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>--This was an unexpectedly good movie--not great, but good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton is the only contemporary director willing to take on the sensitive subjects of society. This film depicted society as it really is not Hollywood style. There are real-life people of different races and backgrounds that live an love together understanding and appreciating differences and each other. This film was about the bad guys going after the "badder" guys. However, the bad guys, had a good reason and enough redeeming qualities that made them look like "good guys". The film was nothing more that good entertainment. Not plausible, not probable but for those of us who do not live in that environment, who knows--maybe this happens all the time. Maybe police and political corruption are still rampant in big cities and maybe, those who are wronged are compelled to fight back in any way the can. It was good to see Mark Walberg again, he's been gone too long from the big screen. Tyrese has become a promising actor. I fear he is and will continue to be type-cast like most black actors, as "the big black guy" that people fear. The interaction between the 4 brothers was great to see. I am sure there are many women in the world like the mother of these guys, that no one ever talks about. I hope people will see this movie because people always get a good feeling when good triumphs over bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some may disagree, I think this is the best movie of the summer. I've seen all the big hits (several flops too) and this movie was by far the best of all of them.It has an excellent cast. All four of the brothers play their parts perfectly, and Singleton directed a compelling character driven, well written story. Wahlberg does well as the tough guy, Andre 3000 (of Outkast fame) does an excellent job as the only brother who made something of himself and Tyrese and Garrett Hedlund are great as the ex-Marine and failed rock star respectively.There is lots of action, but not gratuitous let's blow stuff up for the sake of blowing stuff up. Each action scene drives the characters to discover something new in the murder of their mother.There is plenty of humour too, just like in any tight family, everyone has their foibles that are relentlessly dissected and hit upon. The singer, Jack, takes the brunt of the ribbing, but his brothers' love for him comes out in the huge hit 2/3 through the movie.The characterization is powerful and one of the strongest scenes in the movie is when the four sit down to Thanksgiving dinner, without their mother, and she appears in flashbacks, gently chiding them and/or encouraging them.Going into this, I never thought that the best movie of the summer would star Mark Wahlberg, but this movie was so surprising, I may have to go see it again!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers is an excellent film, despite all the violence. The story revolves around four brothers. They all unite after not being around each other for many years when their mother was shot. After the incident, the brothers try to avenge their mother. The acting is undoubtedly terrific. Mark Wahlberg was the best as Bobby. He showed the true emotions of a character. Garrett Hedlund who played the youngest bro Jack was also great. The two middle brothers played by Andre 3000 of Outkast and Tyrese Gibson were good. All the action scenes were well-planned. The car chase is the best scene. Also the music is pretty good. There are some classic hits in the movie. I recommend this movie for teens 15 and up because of the violence. I rate this film a 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Four Brothers is one of the more underrated films to come out in 2005, because the year was dominated by other great action/crime/thriller films, such as Star Wars, Batman Begins, and Red Eye. However, Four Brothers stands out as a great buddy movie that any group of friends (or brothers) should enjoy together. Starring Mark Wahlberg, Four Brothers is a great film that is pure entertainment at it's finest.When their mother (Fionnula Flanagan) is brutally murdered, her four adoptive sons Bobby (Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jerry (Andre Benjamin), and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) set out to find her killer. And they don't need the help of the police.The acting is certainly spectacular, despite 3 of the stars having started out their careers in music (Wahlberg, Gibson, Benjamin). Wahlberg is a great lead as a character who is a really bad guy...but he's a good man as well. Bobby Mercer is easily one of the most likable characters of recent memory because of his sarcastic attitude and admirable dedication. Tyrese and Andre Benjamin both add emotionally powerful performances, and with Tyrese especially, it's to be expected. Both really show their acting strengths. Garrett Hedlund is the youngest of the brothers, but holds his own. The banter between Hedlund and Wahlberg is priceless and hysterical. Even though they're adopted, you can definitely feel the brotherly chemistry between these two in particular. The four actors all have excellent chemistry with one another, and most of the comedy comes from the brotherly nagging and complaining that every family has. It really gives a relaxed feel to the film, but at the same time not letting us forget how serious the plot of the film is. Chiwetel Ejiofor is good as the villain of the film, but it's an overdone character, which takes the film from a 10 to a 9. Terrence Howard and Josh Charles are also very good in roles as detectives, especially Charles towards the end.Director John Singleton creates a gritty and realistic world for the film, using Detroit as the setting, which (sorry Detroit), is a great idea for a movie like this. All of the events are quick. The film is very fast paced and goes by quickly. There aren't a lot of twists, which I also would have liked, but sometimes straight thrillers with minimal twists, like The Departed, turn out pretty well. The script is average and straightforward, but it's nothing to worry about. The action is as extraordinary as the acting, especially an icy car chase during the dead of night and an extremely well done shootout towards the end. My favorite part was the last 15 minutes, which contains one of the most badass moments in film history. You'll see.9/10 --spy</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Four more Sons of Katie Elder</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film raises anew issues that have haunted action films since the mid-1960s, when there was a weird crossing between east and west, and several occidental directors plagiarized Japanese samurai films to make cowboy movies, and several oriental directors began plagiarizing cowboy movies to make martial arts films. The main issue is whether the plotting of one type of genre action film can be successfully translated into the conventions of another category of action film. It's not a question with a decisive answer; it reappears with every film attempting such a translation.In this case, a classic cowboy film, the Sons of Katie Elder, is "updated" into a contemporary street-gang crime film setting. "SoKE" was not really a great film, just a well-made and entertaining B-movie; any updating would therefore result either in massive restructuring of the plot to produce an original film, or a fairly well-controlled experiment in imitation.I took Four Bros. to be the latter, an imitation. As such, I found it very entertaining. Since as an imitation it exists entirely within the dreamland of Hollywood history, I didn't try to relate it to contemporary reality. As a cowboy movie transplanted to contemporary Detroit, it was well-made and entertaining. (I was especially pleased that there were so little computer-effects; I am sick to death of computerized animation and effects, they are all so phony, only those who have been raised on computers can still be impressed with them.) However, on review of the criticisms written on this film, I must admit that many of them appear justified; the holes in the plotting, the social incongruities, the implausible situations and their unbelievable coincidental resolutions - all true.So, my take on the film is simply this. As entertaining B-movie, accept it as a fantasy and enjoy; but when seeking a comment on real life, look elsewhere.</fullReview>

Every time I was just getting into its groove... Victor would show up. Huh? Who is this actor and why is he on my screen? Who would be afraid of this goof-ball? I can't remember the last time I felt an actor was so over his head in a role. The floor-eating scene... am I the only only one who said to myself, "If I were in that room, I would have made him wipe up that mess he made on the floor, washed his potty-mouth with soap, then spanked his little butt for being too big for its britches and sent him to his room!" Victor Sweet is supposed to be this incredibly powerful Detroit underworld commander... an Overlord of Evil, even. I like the role, and I love the fact that casting selected a relatively unknown actor. I just think it was the wrong actor. He came across... immature.He fell so flat; there was no sincerity, nothing real behind it. Just some goofy guy that the baddies were following because he reminded them mildly of Laurence Fishburne.I kept picturing the filming of the his scenes going something like this: John Singleton: OK. CUT.JS runs hands thru hair and sighs: OK, CHJWETEL, THAT WAS GOOD, LET'S DO IT AGAIN. BUT THIS TIME, CAN I GET YOU TO DO A LITTLE MORE... UM... SOMETHING? CHJWETEL EJIOFOR (CONFUSED): I AM DOING SOMETHING. I'M BEING VICTOR.JS: UM, YEAH. LET'S SEE A LITTLE MORE OF THAT.CE: HUH? JS: WELL, VICTOR HAS A PERSONALITY. WHAT KIND OF PERSONALITY DO YOU THINK HE HAS? CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC. I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.JS: YES, CHJWETEL. HE IS Definitely ENIGMATIC. BUT UNDERNEATH THAT, HE'S A REALLY BAD GUY. REALLY BAD. VICIOUS. EVERYBODY IS SCARED OF HIM BECAUSE THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HE'LL DO NEXT. HE'S BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH THAT COOL EXTERIOR.CE: HE'S ENIGMATIC.JS: YES, BUT BOILING OIL UNDERNEATH.CE: I'M BEING ENIGMATIC.(JS LOOKS AT CHJWETEL)CE, STARING BLANKLY: ENIGMATIC JS STARES CE, STILL STARING BLANKLY JS, MUTTERING AND WALKING AWAY: OH, DEAR GOD, WHAT HAVE I DONE?CE, CALLING AFTER HIM: ENIGMATIC?!??

Pretend the part is being played by someone else.I actually may get it on DVD, then cut out little pictures of another actor (ANY other actor!) and edit them into all of Cjwetel's place... any suggestions?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deroit Streets and Four Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie last night and generally liked it. It has a very strong "street" flavor, "hood" flavor ... if you liked the flavor of Mystic River (I did) you'll like the flavor of Four Brothers.Of course as the title implies, the heart of the movie was the relationship of these 4 brothers ... and of their mother. The dynamics among the brothers as characters and their actions (persons and behaviors) felt very authentic ... and very appealing. The machismo and heavy testosterone level was perhaps predictable given the setting and "attitude"-drenched background on each of the brothers that we're given at the beginning of the brothers. All the same, the expressions interactions were very convincing, to me, and often became poignant without becoming maudlin.This is above all, though, an action flick, and the action was non-stop and generally a blast. I especially liked the battle at the mother's house: a rip-roaring scene full of blood and bullets and attitude, and with a very authentic feel, again.The only thing I wasn't crazy about were a few plain mis-steps plotting ... like when the councilor gets into his car and somehow manages to miss the smashed out window of his car. And it was right beside him, no one getting into their car could have missed it in that position. Please.But that's minor compared to the rest of the movie. Good solid movie.</fullReview>

I was hopeful in this case, and particularly for this film, in part because he finally was given a-list talent to work with. He could have done anything.Unfortunately, he decided to do everything. He decided to make bits of four movies and in each case he merely borrows.I've been thinking about this with my creative partner, about this business of cliché and originality. There's a value to cliché: it speeds the introduction, it settles the viewer quickly and makes things easy to read, to follow.It sets a pattern which if you are clever you can modulate in some way and be recognized for stepping outside the ordinary by using the ordinary. You CAN be amusing using cliché and shorthand. Naturally you skirt stereotypes and with lots of material like this, you can't avoid them.But if you really want to be worthwhile, you do have to be original. You must. You must have enough confidence to make something new and send it out.I suppose each viewer will make their own decisions about who matters in their lives. But someone who utters borrowed phrases can't tell you anything useful, or moving.Can they? Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brother, Can You Spare a Dish of Revenge?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The titled characters (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Garrett Hedlund and Andre Benjamin) return to their childhood home in inner-city Detroit to attend the funeral of their foster mother (Fionnula Flanagan). Flanagan was murdered in a strange convenient store holdup that lacks rime or reason. Our protagonists get suspicious real quick as they seem to get no help from police detectives Josh Charles and Terrence Howard. Soon a city councilman (Barry Shabaka Henley) and a crazed criminal (Chiwetel Ejiofor) get added to the mix as it becomes quite apparent that the crime is not as random as it seems. Director John Singleton's film has shades of those old westerns from the 1950s and 1960s where individual miscreants are brought together for one big mission of revenge. Though kind of dumb and silly at times, I still enjoyed "Four Brothers" because it finally hits a good momentum stride after a slow start. When the action sequences and the plot twists begin to come, then the picture gets that shot of enthusiasm and jolt of energy that it had to have. Adequate action thriller that has enough going for it to make it an entertaining and critically medium-warm success. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Singelton insists once again that people are one dimensional stereotypes.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singleton has directed yet another poor, unbelievable movie. He must think people pretty dumb, to continually take his movies in such a childish and obvious direction. The film oversimplifies human emotion and insists on stereotyping its cast of characters. Just like the seven dwarfs of Snow White, the characters of Four Brothers are spelled out for you almost immediately with no later development to come. In case you can't gather this from the writing, Singleton is there to shove it in your face. On top of this, the chemistry and love needed to bring this film together and bind these men, just isn't there. The relationships are not believable. Not only are the relationships not believable, the characters themselves are not believable as tough guys. Even Mark Wahlberg, who always manages to pull it off, has trouble finding the rage needed to show the vengeful hate the film intends.Although the movie does show a tiny glimpse of a good whodunnit, it is handicapped by a cheap screenplay delivered with false characters and false emotions. Terrence Howard and Mark Wahlberg who are both dynamic and rangeful actors, should be given a head start on this one so to speak because after all, they were working with John Singleton and the "Four Brothers" script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singleton returns with top-flight 'Brothers'</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his disastrous effort in last year's "2Fast, 2Furious," director John Singleton was quickly in danger of becoming a Whiz Kid, or One-Hit Wonder. And while his newest effort, "Four Brothers," isn't exactly a "Boyz N The Hood" (his acclaimed, Oscar-nominated debut film), it is nevertheless a decent work with fine acting, crisp writing and terrific cinematography (Peter Mernzies, "A Time To Kill," "Tomb Raider," "The Great Raid"). When a beloved Detroit foster mother, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan, "The Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood"), is brutally killed in what appears to be a random hold-up, her adoptive sons; hotheaded Bobby (Mark Wahlberg, "Boogie Nights," "Planet of the Apes," "The Perfect Storm"), rocker wannabe, Jack (Garett Hedlund, "Friday Night Lights"), sex-obsessed Angel (Tyrese Gibson, "Flight of the Phoenix") and levelheaded businessman, Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin ? better known as Andre 3000 from the rap duo Outkast), gather to plan revenge. Led by police detectives (Terrence Dashon Howard, "Crash," and Josh Charles, "SWAT") to believe it was a gang-killing and that their mother was in the wrong place at the wrong time, the four soon learn differently. In searching form the truth, they uncover an insidious plot involving a corrupt city councilman (Barry Shabaka Henley, "The Terminal," "Collateral," "Barbershop"), violent Motor City crimelord, Victor Sweet (Chiwetel Ejiofor, "Melinda And Melinda") and a gaggle of crooked cops. The brothers meet force with force, though sometimes the picture threatens to devolve into a typical shoot-'em-up vengeance plot line, but Singleton knows when to draw the line. All the while, Evelyn appears to the boys but, unfortunately does not condemn their increasing violence on her behalf. Wahlberg, who has been really good in some films, but awful in others, shines here, as do the others; but the biggest (and most pleasant) surprise comes from Benjamin, who shows a dimension few would have expected from his rapper pedigree.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>FOUR BROTHERS Returns to the 'Hood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Boyz n the Hood was a landmark film in its realistic depiction of gang violence and its effect on families in urban America. Its novice director, John Singleton, has languished in relative obscurity since then and revisits a similar turf with his revenge drama, Four Brothers. While it reconfirms Singleton's talents, it is an imperfect action drama that leans too heavily on its mean spirited revenge theme.A middle aged woman, Evelyn Mercer (Fionnula Flanagan), is known for taking wayward boys off the streets and finding them foster homes. Yet, over time, only four boys could not be placed, and she adopted them herself. Years later, when a liquor store robbery goes awry, Evelyn is murdered. This reunites the four brothers who are now grown (Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin, and Garrett Hedlund). What seems to be a simple crime gone wrong is only the beginning of a tale of conspiracy and betrayal. With police detectives (Terrence Howard and Josh Charles) seemingly a step behind the clues, the brothers decide to find the answers and punish all those involved even if it leads to corrupt officials, crooked cops, or the top crime boss in town. This causes violent confrontations and retribution until the brothers must attempt a daring plan to avenge their family and bring the murderers to their form of justice.As portrayed by Singleton, this is a tough, violent neighborhood, a sort of distant cousin to the one in Boyz n the Hood. There are some similarities with New Jack City with its family of gangsters and a ruthless leader. The film does contain well directed scenes. The pool hall scene between Howard and Charles is quite good and the dialogue makes this a mini-gem. At times Singleton knows enough to reel back his characters from a pure revenge tale to one of family and connection. There is a good early scene during Thanksgiving at the dinner table where each brother looks upon the memory and visage of his deceased mother in an empty chair and remembers the lessons she instilled in them. It is a clever moment and speaks volumes on what she meant to each son. Perhaps a bit more of this would have balanced the film and kept it from turning into the overwhelmingly vengeful tale it ultimately becomes.The film feels tough and gritty, and its characters are real people with real conflicts and emotions. The relationship of these brothers forms the backbone of the film no matter what they endure. They stick up for each other and watch each other's back. These brothers in arms love each other and fight amongst themselves. We anguish when they suffer and cheer when they triumph. There are humorous moments sprinkled throughout the film and some funny lines spoken at the expense of each character.The story, written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett, works on a couple of levels. On one level, it is a detective story with twists and turns and some surprises. There are some clues and red herrings along the way, and you don't quite know the whole story until the end. On another level it functions as a kind of urban western with its revenge tale. In fact the film is essentially structured similarly to fraternal, revenge westerns as The Sons of Katie Elder and Gunfight at the OK Corral. It's also about the love given by a selfless mother who gave comfort and hope to four wayward rejects when no one wanted them.The ending is a little like an urban Mission Impossible with its elaborate ruse. Some of it is implausible but on the whole the sequence works marginally. We don't know much about Jeremiah Mercer's family which would have added to our attachment to his character.Mark Wahlberg is an imposing figure who will stop at nothing to find his mother's killer.In fact all four leads are quite strong and well cast. Terrence Howard (who has starred in a number of strong films this year and is a star on the rise for sure) has an effective role as a good cop although his character leaves too early as the conspiracy widens. Fionnula Flanagan is seen too briefly and should have been used more which would have grounded the film morally.The soundtrack is a good mixture of oldies and serves as the pulse of the kinetic action scenes in the Motown setting. Technical credits for what is essentially a low budget film are solid especially in the cinematography and film editing.It is entirely possible to be shell shocked by the hard hitting nature of this violent melodrama by film's end. It's certainly a crowd pleaser and almost manipulative in the way it generates deep feelings. The film succeeds in terms of sheer energy and force. It's a little rough around the edges but still a welcome return to Singleton's roots. While Four Brothers proves that his previous abilities were no fluke, he has yet to exceed let alone match the promise of his first film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>hey, i know how excited everyone is about seeing a new 'Mark Wahlberg' movie, but i have to say that this wasn't worth my time. if you want to see women being forced to lick food off the floor, being called dirty names, and having gasoline poured on them then go ahead and watch this one. mark did a great job with his part, but you don't get a chance to understand the rest of the brothers' characters or lives very well. it was only towards the last 1/2 hour of the film i realized that 'jerry' was married w/ kids and had a unionized job living in suburb michigan (i think lansing??). and although one of the brother's Spanish girlfriend was believable at times, her sexual romps with him seemed out of place and her antics distracted the storyline away from the brothers. this could have been such a good movie! it was set in a great city (detroit) and there were good actors but the 'brotherhood' storyline seemed to get lost quickly during the movie. their lives seemed interesting, but we didn't get to know anything about them! and the violence and disrespect towards women (particularly women of colour) made me physically sick and numb.i'm really embarrassed for john singleton--i think he needs to get Ms. Banks back in his life to straighten his head out!i left the movie feeling cheated out of my $10 and will ask for my money back today asap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Detroit on a cold night a robbery takes place and a woman is killed, her name is Evelyn Mercer; mother to four of the toughest and baddest kids on the block. At her funeral all four brothers unite and start investigating the death of their mother which leads them to a conspiracy that reaches the highest points of the city.This is a revenge film with a difference, its about brothers. The whole 'blood is thicker then water' doesn't mean anything. The film has some realistic action scenes that will have the viewer on the edge of their seats as the bullets fly and the punches land.The film explores the bond between the four brothers. Bobby,Jerry, Angel and Jack; all unique in their own way. All four actors provide great performances even Andre Benjamin; the film really strikes a chord when the brothers mourn on their own...The highlight however is the shootout scene and the end fight...shot beautifully capturing the beauty of winter in Detroit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely Exceeded My Expectations...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will state it clearly: I hate street movies. However, there was just some element of Four Brothers that had me cheering for revenge every second of every minute -- of course, the main guy to root for is Mark Wahlberg who gives a pretty good performance. Terrance Howard is also quite good, and is probably one of the only three movies he's adequate in (Iron Man and Crash). Everyone else is slightly sub-par, and even with some okay acting, there's still some flaws that are too nutty to be believable.What worked in this film was the tension. From gunfight to fist-fight, Four Brothers is full of the intensity one would hope for in a vengeful movie. The only two flaws I could point out with the action is a) there is a gunfight in broad daylight, that lasts for 10-minutes it seems, and b) the climax is anything but acceptable in terms of delivering conclusions to our characters that are befitting.The music is not to my taste, and I will only go that far.The writing is all okay, minus the flaws listed above, and the direction is mediocre, but worthwhile.All in all, while definitely not for those of young age, anyone interested in vigilante films and especially ones about revenge might find entertainment in Four Brothers -- I highly recommend it to those in search of such a film.</fullReview>

Having Evan eat of the floor was humiliating enough but then having Evan's wife eat right beside him was very humiliating and showed the sadistic streak of Victor. Setting the movie in the winter must have been hard for all the actors and crew because most of the scenes are outside and you could tell it was cold. The only character that had the moral high ground in the whole movie was Evelyn Mercer and she dies in the first few minutes. Chiwetel Ejiofor has been in several films and he always delivers as does Terence Howard. I am always impressed with John Singleton's films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>REVISED Involving Look at Macho Camaraderie Amidst Violent Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Four Brothers" takes an off-kilter premise and makes it credible, even though over-the-top violence challenges the extensive efforts to create realism.The film is anchored in the strong, macho camaraderie of the four excellent lead actors who convincingly portray two white and two African-American boys raised together as rough foster brothers adopted by a kind-hearted ex-hippie. The easy chemistry among the four is physical, both in interactions and how they move around their childhood home, and in their running graphic teasing. Their back story is smoothly relayed as police report summaries by Terrence Howard, convincingly using his third accent in a film this summer after "Crash" and "Hustle &amp; Flow." (Also stay for the credits when sort of home movies are shown about the brothers' earlier experiences.) While Mark Wahlberg's swagger is a bit much, though worked in as an ex-hockey player context, each actor effectively embodies a unique character at a raw point in his life. Particularly outstanding as non-stereotypes are Garrett Hedlund, as an androgynous rocker haunted by past abuse, and André Benjamin, as a husband and father struggling with a business. Brit Chiwetel Ejiofor very effectively masters Americana as a head hood.While director John Singleton said on "Charlie Rose" that he sees the film as a Western in the tradition of John Ford and Howard Hawks, it's more like Sam Pekinpah crossed with detective "a man's gotta do what a man's gotta do" twisty noir vengeance mysteries. The gritty one-on-one confrontations are much more effective than the exaggerated machine gunned destruction, even as Singleton brings unexpected poignancy to a key rampage through a sympathetic victim that is heartbreaking.Ironically the ex-marine brother is not the lead expert of the four with guns. While this seems like the third in a recent trilogy of using Detroit as a violent wasteland, after the remake of "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Land of the Dead," Singleton accents the usual urban abandonment scenes by telescoping the action between wintry Thanksgiving to Christmas of constant snow, culminating in a white frozen climax that is more cleverly mano a mano and less violent than the preliminary confrontations. It would recall Springsteen's "Meeting Across The River" except that the soundtrack song selections instead superbly are later Motown, visualized nostalgically with '45's playing with the notable local skyline on that dark blue label. The rocker brother is a nice tribute to the city's white kick out the jams heritage as well. Unfortunately, the instrumental score is clunky and unsubtle.The women are strictly ancillary for stereotypical uses, though respected by the men. Sofía Vergara as the "La Vida Loca" old irresistible girlfriend feistily adds to the multicultural mix.Both for the violence and the blunt language, I thought it was really inappropriate that parents brought young children to the matinée I attended.(Revised 29 March 2008 - evidently the version I submitted on 22 August 2005 offended someone)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie,is surprising. It comes across at first as just another typical action movie, but once you get in, you realize that there is so much more depth. Each brother has a back story, but you don't get to know it, just the extreme basics, making you wonder. Take Jack for instance, at the dinner table, he visions his mother saying "I know you terrible things were done to you..." that makes you wonder what happened. You get drawn in the story.The action, obviously, is what draws most people in. But it is really more about family. How far are you willing to go for your family, and there is always a chance to redeem yourself.What really brings the movie together is the brothers themselves, the actors. I can't imagine anyone other than this group of guys in it. I didn't know Garrett Hedlund before this movie, but he was phenomenal. As the boards state below, every tearjerker scene involves him, because he makes it so real. he is the character every viewer identifies with best. He has that boyish charisma makes him lovable, yet he is still distant. I won't go into any further details, because it would give things away, but its the only good action movie that I have wanted to cuddle up and just say "I love my family". ha ha.This movie is awesome.

After some digging around, they are forced to reunite again corrupt cops and gangs, wanting revenge". The acting, I felt was good for the most part. I feel that Mark was a perfect choice for a film like this. Detroit was an excellent location where to set it. For me - it did not have enough blood and violence; I would have liked it way better had their been less talking and more shooting. Had that been the case, I would have given it a higher rating but for now - I am leaving it at a 5 out of a 10.</fullReview>

However, the script is pretty weak, although the interplay between the four main actors is really charming and the shoot out is really well filmed. I found the Western elements to be really cheesy. When Bobby comes at the end to fight Sweet, filmed from the distance, it just seems funny, almost a parody of a bad western. And what about Jack. Although Bobby clearly was devastated at his death, there is little of no mention of him later on in the movie. No one else seems to mourn him. By the way, I thought Garrett Hedlund was excellent in this movie and it is a travesty that he was not nominated at the MTV awards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It grew on me.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching about the first half-hour of "Four Brothers," I pretty much decided that I didn't care for it. As I was watching this film, all I could really think is that the story of four very different people who were raised as brothers reuniting to avenge their adopted mother should be much more character-driven than the by-the-numbers revenge fantasy that I appeared to be watching. The film is well-acted, and it was interesting to see these four brothers fall back into old habits as they shoot, beat, or threaten everyone who gets in their way (they may be the good guys, but they can be just as bad as the thugs that they're after), but I just felt that it was too quick to get to the gangsta-style ultra-violence.My opinion changed somewhere around the halfway point of the film. There wasn't exactly a big revelation that suddenly changed the feel of the film or made everything come together, but something seemed to happen that caused me to see this film as something more than a mediocre Saturday night rental. I started to genuinely care about the four main characters, and I saw them less as the thugs that the movie tells us they are and more as heroes fighting against a truly evil villain. The brothers grew on me as it became clearer that they were up against the worst that the criminal underground had to offer, and as a result the movie grew on me as well. It definitely isn't for everyone, but the strong characters, classic revenge plot, and well-done action sequences definitely make it worth a look for lovers of action movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie takes place on the mean streets of Detroit. The foster mother of four misfits gets murdered and the four brothers take it upon themselves to find the murderers and get revenge.The movie was truly enjoyable. The writers did a good job not making it an overly simplified seek-and-destroy type movie. Yes, the brothers (three of them in particular) were thirsty for blood, but they were equally thirsty for answers, with the main question being "why".Wahlberg (Bobby Mercer) was especially good, Andre Benjamin (Jerimiah Mercer) held his own, and Tyrese Gibson (Angel Mercer) and Garret Hedlund (Jack Mercer) were good enough in their supporting roles. This movie was a nice blend of action and drama. It kept the base male appetite satisfied and also keeps the intellect involved. Another Singleton hit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well me and my mate (another member on here) rented this out Friday night to watch as we thought to give it a try from the good comments we heard about it before.From finishing watching it at 2am we thought it was a really good film for all. It's not the typical gangster film in a way that it isn't shooting every 5 minutes and they don't go round mugging people with black bandannas on around there faces.Yes, it does have some scenes of violence and they are really well produced, kinda reminded of GTA: San Andreas the game for some reason. Family got each others back n all.Overall a film for all to watch that are into this stuff. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An unusual collection of brothers reunite for a common cause.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the mean streets of Detroit, the movie opens with a petty robbery of the corner store. The men are masked, there are no witnesses, they get the cash, but they shoot anyway. This doesn't look like the usual petty robbery, but the police are investigating clues from a "witness." One of the victims is Mrs. Mercer, who years earlier had taken in and adopted these 4 boys who were too much trouble for normal adoptions. She was able to give them some direction in life, and she truly was their mom. Two of the brothers are white, two are black.Mark Wahlberg plays Bobby Mercer, the clear head of the family now. Bobby is never subtle, when he wants something he charges right in. Other brothers are, Angel played by Tyrese Gibson, Jeremiah played by André Benjamin, and the weaker one Jack played by Garrett Hedlund. The brothers come from different parts for the funeral, then decide to help find out what really happened. Terrence Howard has come to be one of my favorite actors, and here he plays Lt. Green, an old friend of the Mercer boys and now in charge of the investigation, helped by Detective Fowler . He pleads with the brothers to let the police do the police work, but that never worked in the Old West and it didn't work here. (The director purposely modeled the style of this movie after the old westerns.)Some of the remaining comments have MAJOR SPOILERS so read further at your own risk. By using strong arm methods, the Mercer boys eventually track things down to local crime boss Victor Sweet (excellent British actor Chiwetel Ejiofor). Turns out that Sweet was hindering Jeremiah Mercer's attempt to start a new business, Mrs. Mercer had gone to the city government to complain, and Sweet had her killed as a result. It was only made to look like a petty theft but in fact was a contract killing. When the Mercer boys unraveled all the details, they systematically planned a way to get Sweet, and the corrupt cop detective Fowler, and pulled it off. All the boys were taken in for questioning as prime suspects, but each gave the same alibi to the questioner -- I was sleeping with your wife when that was happening. With nothing to pin on them, all went free. A classic revenge movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is by far, one of my favorite movies. I wasn't quite sure if I'd like it or not. But usually when there's hott (talented) actors, its a good movie. Since Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund were in it, I figured, 'hey, it might be good.' I cried! I thought it was so sad! I really liked it though. It had a lot of action. I usually don't like movies with lots of blood and gory deaths and guns but it was really good. I really wasn't expecting it to be really good. I thought there were some things that weren't necessary, but I enjoyed. I cried when Jack Mercer (Garrett Hedlund) died...it was so sad. I cried when the brothers were like "c'mon you can do it. stay in there." I really broke down when Bobby Mercer (Wahlberg) was like "you cant die. you're our angel." and then he like had tears in his eyes and then he died. I was like "oh my gosh! this is so sad!" It's a really good movie though. I really liked it. It kept me hanging. I was like, what's gonna happen...whats gonna happen!? You should watch it!!!!! It's amazing!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw Boyz in the Hood when it came out. John SINGLETON is a great director and this was a great movie. It was revenge driven which I seem to really be into. The performance by MARK WAHLBURG was excellent. The dude who played VICTOR SWEET was good to. It was harsh though, that's for sure. The movie had many highlights. The two white dudes and the two brothas, all brothers who were avenging their MOM'S death, or should I say MURDER. Terrence Howard delivers a good performance in this movie as does Josh Charles of DEAD POET'S SOCIETY. This is a great movie and I was very surprised at how much I liked it. I would recommend this to anybody who wants to see some action combined with great acting and writing. Great cameo in this movie by Dick Cheney.</fullReview>

The movie is great and the actors who played the brother were fantastic.They really came off as brothers.MArk Walhberg came off as the big brother and he really cared for the brothers. Tyrese was perfect as the brother who was there to back up what Bobby said. Garrett Hedlund was awesome as the rocker brother and Andre Benjamin was perfect for the good guy part. This movie has all the emotions that you'd want and feel if you were one of them. John Singleton did a fantastic job casting the brothers and he did a great job on the movie in general. I wasn't too sure what I'd get when I saw this movie,but I can honestly say that I loved it and was glad I saw it! I give this movie a 10.If you like action movies,this is for you. Go,watch the movie,then go judge for yourself! Hopefully you wont be disappointed.</fullReview>

This movie was a nice breathe of fresh air after such movies i'm disgusted to even mention.This movie has superb action, drama, and acting, not your average action movie. The movie has characters that we can all get attached to. Even though the mother died in the beginning of the movie, they did a superb job, and it even seemed like a major jaw dropper too. Four Brothers is going on my shelf with the rest of my dvds, and this one should be with your collection too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marky Mark and His 'Funky Bunch' Do Us Proud...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you'd have told me this time last year I would have ended up waiting for the DVD release of a 'Detroit Massive' style film with Mark Wahlberg, the dude from Outkast and Paul Walker's mate from '2 Fast, 2 Furious' I'd have thrown my popcorn in your face and laughed. Very loudly.Oh how wrong I was. I was dragged to see this film, against my will, but as soon as the film started and I started digging that Motown soundtrack I was captured.The story follows four adopted brothers (Wahlberg, Andre Benjamin, Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund) who return the their hometown of infamous Detroit to avenge their murdered mothers death.Wahlberg is very good. I've over-looked him in the past, but his hard-man act in life transpires perfectly on screen and his famous 'school of hard knocks' stamp, works very well. Wahlberg plays Bobby Mercer, the elder of the four brothers, but not the most responsible. Bobby, the hot-head of the Mercer family is constantly pulling out guns on trouble-makers, much to the dismay of sensible, family orientated Jeremiah (played, surprisingly by Andre Benjamin/3000 A.K.A the lead from Outkast) Jeremiah, is the sensible younger brother, the one who's stayed loyal to his roots in Detroit and set up a family with reliable, rational wife, Camille. Tyrese Gibson plays army Jarhead Angel, more likely to adhere to his girlfriends wishes than anyone elses. The youngest of the four, and the brother who is the butt of most of the films hilarious jokes is Garrett Hedlund, who plays Jack and consequently spurs a ton of 'is he/isn't he gay' posts up here on IMDb.The film is very, very well written by David Elliot and Paul Lovett and includes some very hilarious one-liners (mainly from Wahlberg) and at the same time creates an interesting and touching brotherly intimacy that films like these often leave out in fear of 'offending' the big tough 'boyz from da hood.' Director John Singleton does an amazing job, we get four superb and extremely different characterisations from the great actors leading the show and watch out for the car chase scene (Singleton does them oh-so well) as it is one of the best in film history! All in all this film is wonderfully lead by Marky Mark who gains a whole new 'Funky Bunch' in Four Brothers and although it appears to most as a 'mans-film' don't let that put you girls off. The family network is superb and you can always sit there debating on which brother you like best? A surprising personal hit of 2005 (which was a bad year for films I must say) and was defiantly in my top ten. An under-rated piece of cinema that will never get the acclaim it deserves, but will sit well with most people who venture to see it, be if for the action, humour or lets be frank - good looks of the Mercer Brothers.</fullReview>

Just talking about it right now makes me want to go and watch it again!!! My favorite character would have to be Angel, he tears some gangsters down!! It is sweet to see the Mercer's get their revenge. Now I'm from the suburbs so i do not know if crime is really that bad in the city, but it seemed realistic to me that something like that could happen in a city like Detroit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year with movies such as Mr. and Mrs. Smith, Star Wars episode III, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire, and War of the Worlds the best movie I watched was Four Brothers. The movie was an emotional roller-coaster from beginning to end.I have almost no qualms about this movie. Great action sequences, an awesome chase scene, laughter, tragedy, and a truly despicable villain. How can you go wrong? Throughout the whole movie, I was trying to put it down, "How could a movie keep this up? It is gong to slow down" were thoughts that coursed through my mind whenever there was a slower section. Of which the dips in action were all well timed and weren't frivolous.All four brothers, a few villains, and the cops were all well developed characters. Where most movies have trouble developing two or three characters, this movie managed to develop nine characters by my count.I write this review several months after I saw the movie in theater, and I am anticipating the DVD. Which I will happily spend twenty dollars on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cool, speedy, action flick...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My personal observation was that the movie was a great "distraction flick". It's the kind of movie you wander into the theater to see after you had a fight with your best friend. Or a movie you take a date to see. It's not exactly heavy, thought-provoking stuff. Mostly it's tough guy machismo hyped to the umpteenth degree and complete with a snowy, blown-tire, skidding car chase. But I liked it.First, the chemistry between the "brothers" was touching. Tyrese's character was distracted throughout most of the movie, but the other three were so into their roles, you wanted to believe in their plight. You wanted to see justice done for the heartless murder of their caring adopted mother. You held your breath through certain parts, fists clenched, butt numb from teetering on the edge of your SEAT! Second, the eye-candy factor was through the roof. As a female, it didn't hurt to watch some aesthetically-pleasing boys swooping through the ghettos of Detroit with guns bigger than hell. I'll admit it was mental junk-food. Nothing profound or "new" came from this movie. But for almost two hours I was caught up in this gut-wrenching, adventurous, fast-paced, suspense ride and I didn't once try to read my watch against the glare of the big screen. That speaks volumes about my contentment to see the movie through to the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first went to see this movie i thought okay this is another shoot-um'up action flick. In someways it is but it's more because it reminded me of another movie that is one of my favorites. The Sons of Katie Elder with John Wayne. In this movie four guys return home after the passing of their mom only to find out there something wrong and darker thats the reason for her death(Just like S.O.K.E.). The sons have a reputation for being a little much to handle and now with finding out there might be more going on behind their moms death. As they say in the hood " It's on Muther#&amp;*%$*!" I'm not saying Mark Wahlberg is like John Wayne but he kicks some ass in this just like the Duke. Now i could be wrong but these movies are very similar in the fact that nobody messes with Mom and if you do it's going to be hell to pay!</fullReview>

Questioning society, law, and love, common themes but brought to life by them all just so fantastically.

		<shortDescription>A family reunion to remember.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton, who has long ago established himself as a visionary director of groundbreaking racial and street-influenced urban dramas, offers his latest effort, "Four Brothers", a film which effectively blends subtle and exhausting psychological anguish with unrestrained physical manifestations of restless and violent revenge.The film, set in wintry Detroit, begins on the threshold of the holiday season, where Evelyn Mercer, an upstanding citizen, and the community's Good Samaritan of sorts, is gunned down during what seems like a random convenience store robbery.Much like someone who would take in an abandoned stray animal, Evelyn had made it her lifelong mission to rescue and shelter wayward youngsters who originate from a life of crime and broken homes.Bobby (Mark Wahlberg), Angel (Tyrese Gibson), Jeremiah (Andre Benjamin) and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) are brothers, not by biological ties, but because they were raised together by Evelyn after her inability to locate willing foster families for them.Bobby is a headstrong individual, whom despite his salvation, has never much been able to leave trouble behind him, and has spent some time in prison, Angel is a womanizer who loves to show off his sexy Latina girlfriend, Jeremiah is a reformed business and family man, and Jack is an aspiring musician.After having gone their separate ways, the quartet reunite, albeit, under unpleasant circumstances, for their foster mother's funeral, and thereafter, assemble at their childhood home where they are seen experiencing a few private moments of grief and sharing a subdued, reflective and nostalgic Thanksgiving dinner.Seeking answers to Evelyn's unjustified death, the brothers begin to investigate, and soon realize that her murder was not a spontaneous act, but rather, a premeditated plan.Feeling that law authorities aren't doing enough to solve the case, the foursome set out on their own to locate the people responsible and to serve their own brand of justice, during which they encounter corruption from city officials and from a menacing gang lord, Victor Sweet, who isn't at all like what his name implies, and whose method of manipulation and control is to publicly humiliate his henchmen.There is also the arising issue of life insurance fraud, which causes a shade of suspicion and blame to be cast upon one of the brothers.The movie carries over distant echoes of a John Wayne western entitled, "The Sons of Katie Elder", with the vast country expanses, replaced here, by a claustrophobic setting of imposing tenements and cold concrete.The atmosphere nicely conveys a melancholy mood with its scenes of frigid, icy conditions which almost seem to melt away under the calm, smoky strains of Motown tunes.The male-dominated cast demonstrates the competent acting talents of, what is for the most part, an assembly of hip-hop artists. One such star is Mark Whalberg, who can also add Calvin Klein modeling to his credentials. Over the years, he has proved himself as a strong lead, capable of deftly and confidently guiding and supporting ensemble pieces, as was the case in the recent remake of another crime caper, "The Italian Job".Despite all of the action and violence, the film nonetheless succeeds in its study of interracial relationships, the hardships of street life and family values, and most of all, concludes with a satisfying payoff.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is your basic revenge movie. Mark Walberg plays Bobby Mercer, one of four brothers who have come home for their mother's funeral. Being from the street, Bobby and his brothers want to find out who did this to their mother and get justice, street justice. Through their own investigating, they find out their mother's death was for more than just a simple robbery.Though this movie had some good shoot'em-up action, there was not anything special about it. Unlike 'Mystic River', none of the performances were particularly spectacular. However, Chiwetel Ejiofor (who plays Victor Sweet) does an awesome job as the villain. He develops a character that you really want to hate. In the end, you cheer for his demise. Terrence Howard (as Lt. Green), from 'Hustle and Flow', also does a great job as a cop trying to help the Mercers.Overall, this film was not too bad. But, there were a couple plot flaws and inconsistencies that ruined it for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Critics are already dogging this movie because they didn't appreciate it for what it was. "I hope this movie was meant to be funny." I'm not exactly sure what they were looking for or what they thought they were sitting down to watch. This is a movie about revenge and vigilante justice, plain and simple; it doesn't flaunt itself as anything more or less. The characters are well laid out, and each of them very well acted (Marky Mark gives the performance of his life. Even if he were the only good actor here, he could carry it. And Andre 3000 deserves a round of applause for a damn decent job himself).Are you looking for deep discussions on morality? Do you want a grave statement about poverty and the downfall of society? Why are you watching this movie? There are millions of movies that focus very well on those topics. But sitting down to "Four Brothers" with these things in mind is like sitting down to "Scarface" in search of a romantic comedy. You're missing the point. This is a very good movie about revenge, vigilante justice and Mark Wahlberg dressed like Mike Patton and kicking ass.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has ups and downs, but worth seeing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just a bit of forewarning, this review is going to include spoilers.After watching this movie, I found that the movie marketing industry is going downhill, as all of my predictions for the movie were right. For example, when a movie titled "FOUR Brothers", and you see the names and faces of actors Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, and Andre Benjamin, it becomes natural to assume one of two things: a.) Garret Hedlund (the fantastic actor who plays the fourth brother) dies, or b.) Someone in the whole movie making process to preview editing process can't count. The former of the two would be the accurate one. The movie also has a lot of open ends, such as what was so bad about these kids that they couldn't get a home elsewhere? The movie does a little development of character for each of the brothers, mostly on present development, giving very little to the past.The acting on the other hand was awesome. Mark Wahlberg always does good as a leading man and continues his reputation with this movie. Tyrese Gibson, who is an emerging actor from the past 9 years, plays the stereotypical role you'd expect to see someone of his stature playing, in other words, the guy who is pimping the girl and running around shooting things. Andre Benjamin plays the more successful of the brothers and did a fine job at creating the feel of someone who started out bad but then turned right, making character acknowledgements towards a rough past, but standing as a firm family oriented man. Garret Hedlund does, in my opinion, his best job yet, being a very new actor on the scene, showing through consistently noted childhood trauma through an emotional, almost terrified, face, as well as establishing a very human character who is used to getting picked on and just roles with it (as many people do).The plot is good, it makes sense, much more than most movies that are made these days. It follows the story of likely events. It does carry its brief surrealistic points used for cinematic purposes, but the majority of the events actually are a possible reality for some people to go through.Altogether, I'd say this was an Okay to Good movie, not something I would bother seeing twice, but one I might consider buying when it comes out on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great way to end the summer with a huge action packed vengeance movie. Unlike most other action movies, it's not laden down with total explosions in every scene. Some comic lines were thrown in, as well as one very angry off Mark Wahlberg. Wahlberg did an excellent job portraying Bobby Mercer, but the major surprise was Andre 3000. With with no huge acting experience, he took on the role and nailed it perfectly. With the help of Garrett Hedlund and Tyrese Gibson, "Four Brothers" showed how one diverse family can come together to avenge their mother. Not just a shoot and kill movie, there are sequences that show the brothers' "other" side as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spoiler -Four Brothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie was enjoyable, that was actually very surprising since the previews seemed to give the entire movie away. Nonetheless, the cast that made up the four adopted brothers was very well put together and very appropriate for each role. I was happy to see that they weren't stereotypical roles, well not too stereotypical, at least compared to the characters on Singelton's 2 Fast 2 Furious...Well onto more criticisms: First off it was pretty obnoxious how throughout the entire movie they made a big deal about Andre 3000 being part of the Union back in the day -- and how nearly everyone he bumped into was part of the Union with him, it became lame. There were also a lot of scenes that didn't add up, such as how they seemed to come to speedy conclusions as to how and who killed their foster mother, and how did Mark Walhberg get to the middle of the lake without a vehicle in what looked to be below zero temperature?! In the end the brothers prevail, but lack the power of the fantastic foursome since one of them did get shot in a crazy shootout sequence that did move me to the edge of my seat with anticipation! So if you are out for one of the last summer's blockbuster filled with roll your eyes kinda' action and loads of thoughtless entertainment that will satisfy the macho in us all, then this movie is the one for you! Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Revenge leaves plot out in the cold"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would just like to say that in the last couple years, I have not been the type of person to hang out at the local movie theater and go see every movie that comes out. Anymore..I really have to be truly interested in seeing the movie. It has to be an original story, the only time it does not matter, would be like if its a comedy..sometimes you just need a good laugh even if the movies sucks. "Four Brothers" was the first movie I have seen in the theaters since I saw the sci-fi epic re-make of "War of the Worlds"; and lets just say I was crossing my fingers for a good "ghetto murder/mystery". Now I knew going into the theater, what I was getting into..I mean you have a coming home to the old neighborhood story from "Boyz n the Hood" director; John Singleton, thrown in with leading "brother"; a former bad boy himself, Mark Wahlberg. The film started out decent enough, the story of four foster brothers who return home to Detroit to the crime-ridden and poverty-stricken streets of their youth, to bury their foster-mother who was just recently killed in a supposed liquor store robbery."Revenge" and "an eye for an eye" turned into the themes; instead of a more elaborate plot of maybe their mother having uncovered something or witnessed something she shouldn't have..instead the reason behind her murder was the fact that she had been making a public fuss about one of her sons losing his public assistance for his business..their mother had found out that because her son would not pay protection to the local crime boss..who owned the politicians and half the police, this gangster was causing her son to lose his business. Possibly a bit predictably, I think the story would have flowed better, had there been more of a mystery behind why their mother was killed, even something as cheesy as she found out that a local cop or politician was using a public building, like a community center to store guns or drugs..and local kids were being used as mules or something sinister. Something that the director did that I definitely liked was the way he had the spirit of their mother talk to them all individually at several points in the film. I think the directory did this instead of the typical flashback sequence..that you see in most films. I admit in most movies.the flashback sequences are usually too long or unclear and many times too frequent. But not to come off sounding contradictive of my own belief, I think at least one or two flashbacks could have worked. I wish we would could have at least one scene when the boys were younger?to know where they came from..or maybe what they went thru..before they found their adoptive mom. The director attempted to make the one brother "Jack" played by Garrett Hedlund(Troy, Firday Night Lights), gain the sympathy of the audience, by constantly having the other brothers; tease him for being the youngest and refer to him as a queer, and a weakling. I think the director did this in hopes that when he got killed the audience would mourn his passing. I think if we had a bit more background on "Jack", and all the other brothers for that matter than maybe the audience would have felt their pain and loss more easily.All together the movie was a decent flick, a very entertaining show. I got my monies worth I would say. Its not surprising that it was number one at the box office this weekend, I mean it did not have much competition."Four Brothers" was an all-together good show, and I recommend it, but save your money on a cinema ticket?it can wait till video.movie extras: 1-"sexy lady in cold Detroit" Keep an eye out for the hot latina super model Sofia Vergara, she has a small part as Tyrese Gibson's girlfriend. You may not recognize her at first because she is sporting dark roots to portray a Puertorican, apposed to her normal blonde locks; but her beautiful Columbian body that never stops, is recognizable instantly.2-"good guy &amp; bad guys" Actor Josh Charles who typically played quite good guys in films such as: "Dead Poets Society", "Don't Tell Mom the Babysitter's Dead", and "Threesome", has found a knack lately playing double-crossers and crooked cops; first in "S.W.A.T." and now again in "Four Brothers".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i watched this movie, because i think john singleton is one of the best directors around. his boyz n the hood was nothing short of genius, and this movie was just as wonderful. the brothers were all standouts, especially bobby and jack. it was great to see josh charles in this type of role, after dead poet's society. i remember chitwetel from love actually, and this was a departure for him as well. even though the story is basically a revenge saga, it had its best moments in the fact that the brothers were bound together by the love and appreciation for their mother. it was non stop action for fans of this type of genre, and i highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This had some of the feel of Super Fly but with a bigger budget. Unfortunately no Curtis Mayfield on the sound track. That would have been a really cool homage. I think the Jefferson Airplane piece at the beginning was out of place, but the other songs on the soundtrack all fit the bill appropriately.The film did not deliver the promise of the trailer, which had a much tighter feel and, to my view, a much higher emotional tenseness.Everyone in this was good and the writing and direction was competent. (Saying someone in the movie business is competent is not a complement I'm afraid.) If the two main antagonists in this had been creepier, scarier and more menacing I think the film would have been much more memorable.Overall I liked this film. I think it is worthwhile viewing and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film, with a massive message!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Four brothers is a film which contains a message: that it is not the color of your skin that matters, and that some things are thicker than blood. The plot of this movie makes the viewer very much a part of it, as a viewer you understand what the characters are about, and you can understand them, and the way they act. Also, the way the actors plays their parts... We already knew that Mark Whalberg is a great actor, but together with the rest of the cast, it is made so obvious yet again. And lets not forget the three other"brothers". First of all, Garrett Hedlund made quite the impression. He really managed to capture both the strength and "badness" of Jack, but still keep the vulnerable part. And when taking the fact that this is only his third movie.. Well, he rocked!! :) Both Tyson and André did a really good job as well. Anyway, this film made such an impression on me that I saw it three times in just two days. And this says a lot, if you take into consideration how many movies I've actually seen. You can't really explain what makes this movie so good, so there are only one way to find out; See it!!</fullReview>

Its an emotional film with fantastic action sequences. The four brothers are portrayed by Mark Wahlberg, Tyrese Gibson, Andre Benjamin and Garret Hedlund. They capture the essence of the characters perfectly and convince you of there love for their mother and each other.This film is an emotional must see, its breath-taking and action packed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One day Singleton will rise up...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Singleton has all the skills to make great movies, this isn't one, but he is getting closer. I don't know what's holding him back, but I wait for the day when he makes a movie that will kick my ass. There is great subtlety in this movie (for an action movie), and the performances, from actors most people don't respect, is well above average. But in the end this is a 1970's revenge movie, with a hipper black feel. John Singleton's love of 70's cinema is all over this movie, from the look and feel all the way to the music, and it makes the movie all the more endearing.This movie only strengthens my resolve that this man will one day make a masterpiece, a movie that will make Boyz in the hood, a great debut, but not a great movie (not the classic that people try and make it out to be). What is good, is that after all these years, Peebles, Lee and Singleton are still making damn fine films, what is disappointing is that there aren't more black directors stepping towards the mainstream, with the authority and flair of these talented men.But what would I know, I'm just a snow flake from Melbourne.</fullReview>

Mark Wahlberg as the tough guy, Tyrese Gibson as the sit there and look tough guy, Garrett Hedlund as the rocker (love his hair in this film!) and Andre 3000 as the good guy. A lot of humour in this and a lot of sad moments that really made the watcher empathise with the four brothers. disagreed with the ending though the way that Jack dies is just SO sad i think everyone in the cinema was in tears by the end of that whole scene! Garrett is a brilliant up and coming actor and i look forward to his next film! Very good film well worth seeing despite the very very sad ending!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very unsure about this movie, I mean the actors consist of an old rapper (Mark Wahlberg)who hasn't done any good movies, a pretty good rapper (Andre 3000), who in my mind should stick to music, a singer (Tyrese) who has been placed in good movies, and still did a horrible job, and a new actor (Garret Hedlund) who I just found out played in Friday Night Lights and Troy. It has a nice plot, and shows different personalities of brothers this day and age. The screening that I went to see was not finished all the way, the screening guy said there will be some stuff removed and things added, usually after seeing a screening I usually wait until its out on DVD, and if it was a good screening I will buy the DVD, but in this case I will probably go see the movie more than once just because I will not be able to wait for it to come on DVD. This movie is all around great it has laughs, tears, and action, this movie should be up for a big award, during the movie award season. I recommend this movie to all movie buffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has definitely been a Singleton summer. Singleton epitomizes the independent spirit and what it means to hustle a movie that he believes in. Four Brothers belongs in the gangsta archives. He brings the fire with the ill cinematography and the bang out scene is bananas! It is a modern-day urban western with the right dosage of violence and revenge. This flic stands on its own. The storyline is original and engaging. And the teaming of four exceptional actors is evident with their comedic and dramatic skills. Andre does the damn thing and makes his mark with the melodic dialogue and acting. Who says hip-hop performers can't act? The black Denalis on white ice, WOW! Singleton proves the industry wrong every time. He can't be pigeonholed. Much respect.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody brilliant.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To begin with, I'll just say that this was the best non-epic film I've ever seen. I was sceptical originally, but this film just totally blew my mind. I didn't think gangster movies could get this insanely good. But Four Brothers is. The general idea (though most people reading this will already know) is this: Four adopted brothers (the Mercers) reunite in Detroit (the ex-hometown of 3 of them) to bury their murdered mother. Bobby and Angel (Mark Wahlberg and Tyrese Gibson) are your average degenerates, and the oldest of the lot. Jerry (Andre Benjamin) is a family man trying to make something of his hopeless life, and Jack (Garrett Hedlund) is the youngest, and the most messed up. It doesn't take long for the brothers to decide the investigation by the police isn't going to be enough, and thats when the fun begins. One of the great things about this movie is that its not just some excuse to shoot a lot of people. The whole start of the film is spent establishing the strong bonds the brothers share. They aren't like actors pretending to be brothers, they're just like brothers. It sounds insulting to say that they're acting, its that good. The dialogue isn't the stuff of intellectuals. The language is bad, the jokes crude (but non-the-less often hilarious), but it doesn't seem out of place or gratuitous. It all works toward building up the atmosphere, and it works perfectly. The action scenes are great. Action isn't really my thing, but this I enjoyed. The humour helped out through most of these scenes (though toward the end of the movie, it subsided, which is just as well, the last few action scenes being too intense to allow for jokes), and it was a lot of fun to watch. But the thing that really drew me in to the film was the emotional side: There wasn't any of that 'we're so tough, we never cry' sh!t that you see so often in Hollywood movies. It was very realistic, and thats something that Hollywood usually skips out on. (Unfortunately). The characters had feelings and motives (other than plain violent revenge), and it worked. I'm not big on crying in movies, but this one got me. Some films are sad, and some are just devastating. I was devastated. Kudos go to Mark Wahlberg and Garrett Hedlund for their performances: Bobby was charismatic (most of his lines were improvised), hot-headed, and just plain brilliant to watch. Jack was damaged, and Garrett Hedlund did a beautiful, subtle job putting across the inner-workings of his characters mind. The 'bad things' that had happened to Jack before he joined the Mercer family are never really mentioned, but the impression is strong. I was really intrigued by him. Hedlund would have been just 20 at the time, and its no wonder his career is taking off so well. He was picked up for a part in Troy (thats a blockbuster movie there) within a month of moving to LA. He ain't just a pretty face: you don't get picked up that fast if you aren't talented. Bobby and Jack's relationship is a wonderful thing: Jack is notably Bobby's favourite, and he protects his little brother as best he can, though he gives him as hard a time as possible. They confide in one another, and I'm glad the film makers weren't too busy making Bobby macho to do that. Overall, I just have to say that I was completely amazed by how incredible this movie was. Its the kind of movie that might appeal to both males and females, having combined the elements stereo-typically loved by either sex. Absolutely worth the money, I recommend it above all things. Movies this good are rare, so don't miss your chance.</fullReview>

Police Lt. Green(Terrence Howard)advises against taking matters in their own hands. Crime lord Victor Sweet(Chiwetel Ejiofor)and a dirty cop(Josh Charles)figure heavily in the atrocious and needless crime. Rounding out the cast: Sofia Vergara, Taraji P.

		<fullReview>Okay, I respect Mark W. a lot. He came from nothing, tried the boy band/model thing for awhile, and grew into a pretty good actor (sometimes great). However, this particular film just didn't do it for me. I felt like it was trying to get me to feel something for the brothers love for their mother, their love for each other etc. However, I have a hard time feeling it when the movie is trying too hard. Instead, I only feel like wincing at every sappy scene and never end up caring about the characters at all. Good job by Andre 3000 though (debut?). My advice: skip this movie and rent Boyz in the Hood (same director) which is more real, raw, and intelligent than this movie ever could be... Sorry Mark!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Singleton's Four Brother is not as good as a typical 7.1 IMDb rating film, this film IS not a great revenge action flick. Actually its only bright-sides are a few cool action sequences and a good performance by Mark Wahlberg. Tyrese Gibson and Garrett Hedlund do not give good performances, so there's 2 of the brothers already disappointing. Andre Benjamin was decent in his role. The screenplay had many flaws and holes in it, including twists that were illogical and turns that were predictable. The acting saved it a bit for me, i liked Wahlberg and Benjamin, but the highlights were the two cops trying to stop these 4 brothers from doing their revenge, played by Howard and Charles, both giving good performances (howard is having a hell of a year with crash, hustle and flow and this). I want to see Singleton's hustle &amp; flow and i hope its not as bad as this. This film just didn't cut it, decent direction, some good acting, horrible script, and overall just a studio movie that was not believable at all. 6/10</fullReview>

This is to be expected by those who are familiar with Singleton's previous endeavors but to those who aren't, this should be always remembered.I won't bother with retelling the premise of the movie because if you've heard anything about it, you've heard everything there is concerning this film. Four brothers get back together to avenge their mother. That's all it is. There are no interesting side-plots; no particular character development (what the characters are in the beginning is how they wind up in the end). There is only one major action sequence that looks like it consumed most of the budget.Save this one for the dollar theater when there's nothing better to watch. It's certainly watchable; it's place on the list of movies to watch, however, is rather low.</fullReview>

The action in the movie cannot disappoint anyone, but it is offset by brilliant humor and depth of the characters. Don't pay attention to the critics who wouldn't know if a movie was good if it bit them in that "four star" rating of theirs. Mark Wahlberg does not disappoint fans, by keeping his usual "bad boy" image, however, he does give his character depth and history which makes his acting brilliant and noteworthy. The other three actors are superb as well. I believe one of them is Andre' 3000 a singer, making his debut movie performance, did a great job.

		<fullReview>12:15am... My boyfriend and I walk in a bustling theater parking lot, and we can't contain our excitement. FINALLY- a movie worth our time and money!! 'Four Brothers' silenced their biggest critics ever- movie buffs. Ironically, 'Four Brothers' was our 'last resort movie'. We just wanted to get out of the house, but really had no interest in any of the movies playing. Thankfully we were highly mistaken. After a nearly two hour action filled film, I had laughed, I had cried, I sat at the edge of my seat and even screamed a few times. During the course of the film, movie watchers spoke out at the screen (without receiving any harsh 'shhh-ing'). The movie captivated and involved every soul in the audience. Everyday emotions were touched: pain, anger, revenge, confusion, love. The actors weren't actors; they were real people- everyday people. Our brothers, our sisters, our cousins, our mothers, our family- our truths. 'Four Brothers' is action, drama, comedy; but most of all, 'Four Brothers' is inspiration. A movie making money is a hit. A movie making millions is a chart-topper. But a movie making memories- that's a success.</fullReview>

There was a lot of cursing and violence and a little sexual content (not a lot). I usually don't like a lot of violence, but the blend of funny lines with the violence took the edge off for me. Living and teaching in the city I do, I can really believe the dialog and violence portrayed in the movie. It's a movie that I'm going to pay to see when it's officially released.

His goofy, cocky walk was right out of a comic book. No, wait, that's an insult to all comic books.

I'm nineteen so this movie was aimed at my age group but it should have been aimed at twelve year olds. I enjoy outkast musically and I believe Andre Benjamin had the strongest performance and most developed character. The other three were just hotheads. Wow, never seen that before. The character Jack, the "rocker", so to speak was really cliché. The fight scene at the end where it shows Mark Whalberg walking up to the villain and the group of guys, where was he walking from. Nothing for miles in that direction.(If you've seen the movie you'll know what I'm talking about.) Maybe you can call this an easy pleaser but I don't think it qualifies as that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preview was great the release is bound to rock!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always skeptical of Mark Wahlberg's acting skills, I hesitated when offered tickets to this preview screening. I was, however, gratefully surprised that he wasn't playing his usual pretty-boy-tries-for-tough-guy role. More impressive was the fact that the plot line and dialogue were so believable. I could venture a guess that most people will not appreciate the graphic violence of this film but I can tell you that it is necessary to make the overall experience of the movie believable. There is nothing miraculous about this movie and no themes are terribly difficult to discern. If you were ever curious about the reaction children would have to the murder of a loved parent, you can pretty much see it played out in this film. Congrats to the studio, this one is a good watch!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was lucky enough to see an advance screening last week. My friends and I were very entertained. It was very humorous- had great one liners. Mark Wahlberg was my favorite. He was hysterical. Tyrese, Andre 3000 and Garret Hedlund did great jobs as well. It was all about the chemistry between the brothers. It had great music as well. They used a lot of old Motown songs. It was action packed and funny. The audience was really into it. They were cheering and clapping. We were pretty much sitting on the edge of our seats. I have to admit I'm not a huge John Singleton fan but he really shocked me. I think he did a wonderful job. I recommend it to everyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Eye was absolutely amazing. Rachel McAdams performance in this movie was outstanding and I loved it. Cillian and Rachel did so great together that I want to see it again and I am going to pay the over priced ticket to do so. Simply Amazing. I love the way Rachel McAdams is so diverse when it comes to her acting and she can play any part that she wants an she can do it beautifully. Cillian Murphy was great too. He was very convincing in the movie an I really believed that he was a crazy man. I loved loved loved Red Eye. Absolutely wonderful.I was scared for Lisa (Rachel McAdams) but at the same time I knew she would get out of it. I loved the bathroom scene, that made me jump.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best movie Eva!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was probably the best action movie that I saw in 2005. Once I saw this movie, I just had to watch all of Garrett Hedlunds movies, and I just so happen to have all of them on DVD, I didn't even know that until I figured out what other movies he was in. Anyway, all the actors played there part in the movie very well. Like Jerry, the responsible brother, but he is hiding pretty well that he has a little problem that he does hide very well. and the older brother does play is part very well also. He caring mostly about Jack since he is the youngest, but he also is hard on the all of the bros too. Angel just, he just gets he part done perfectly, I could go on, and on, about how well this movie was written and acted. I love this movie so much! P.S. Jack is so hot!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great depths, but keeping the surface at all time.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hey EverybodyThis was a movie from which I didn't expect much. I thought this was a flick you oughta watch with a banging hangover and no appetite. But, I was completely wrong. This was a stunning movie when I got into it.I did expect great action though, but Four Brothers was beyond that. It both showed great emotion, and at the same time stunning action. When it got emotional, I got the shivers and almost tears, and when they were fighting I was sitting on top of the seat with a raised fist and shouting (quite embarrassing, actually =D). Anyways, as I wrote in the headline. It has great emotional depths, and at the same time it holds your attention with the somewhat extremely violent action scenes.This is a movie which can give you great experiences, but it requires your full attention. If you give it so - Brilliant. Full scale from me.***** - Five of five possible stars.~Simon</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good revenge movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Detroit four adopted kids (played by Mark Wahlberg, Garrett Hedlund, Andre Benjamin and Tyrese Gibson) get together for their moms funeral. She was accidentally shot to death in what was just a robbery at a convenience story. But they begin to find out that her killing may have been more than just an accident and set out to find who killed her...and why.The script is nothing new but this is still a pretty good movie. The story gets a little overly convoluted but the numerous twists and turns keep you watching. Also making the brothers both black and white is a good idea--it adds more tension (racial and otherwise). The four actors also work well together and play off each other in a natural manner. There are bursts of loud and exciting action with extreme violence well directed by John Singleton.There are some problems however--the script has some TERRIBLE lines and has some unfunny comedy shoehorned in. Also Wahlberg is (surprisingly) terrible and he should never attempt comedy again--the man does not know how to be funny. The view of females here is also problematic--they're either screaming witches (Gibson's horribly stereotyped Latina girlfriend) or sex objects.Still, this is a good revenge film with a satisfying ending. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'd go see it.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie yesterday and was surprised to actually enjoy it. The posters and previews didn't really get me excited about it but I went anyway (because the screening was free.) There was a lot of chemistry between actors which made it really funny. I've never dug on Mark Wahlberg, but everything was pretty good. I expected it to get more into the cheap racial cracks and it actually didn't which was cool. I heard it was more or a flick only for the guys because of the violence and the main characters being all male, but I really didn't find that to be the case. I enjoyed it as much as anybody did. I was sitting in the critics section and they were all laughing too. Realistically, depending on your tastes and what you're in the mood for you may not love it... but you'll like it. I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A enjoyable but nonsensical fight for justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie had major potential. It could have been much better. I'm not saying don't see it, I found really fun. Look at it as total fluff. Don't expect an excellent movie, which is why I was disappointed by it. There were a bunch of things that just didn't make sense. All of the problems could have been easily fixed. I think it would have been better if they had taken it through the typewriter one more time. There was one fundamental flaw: here you have a woman who tried to fix delinquents like the four brothers (Wahlberg, Tyrese, Andre 3000 and Hedlund) but she gets killed and what do these brothers do? Use violence to find what they want. It just didn't add up. Still enjoyable;e if you watch it in the spirit of a 70's B-movie. All camp and action. I recommend it for a cold, snowy winter night. A good rental. All in all this could have been much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>warning: spoiler - enjoyed it but not paying for the DVD</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I enjoyed it but it wasn't a movie to go spend any money on and buy it when it comes out today. Unless of course you are a Mark Walberg fan and want to add it next to is other great selections(The Basketball Diaries, Traveller, and not yet released The Canada Job or something). The symbolism of him picking up piece of lumber that is a 1x4 for the siding wall on a house(which you wouldn't use)and then cut it in the middle of the yard with a miter saw is just down right ridiculous. Does he really become changed from a hard ass messed up dude to a well right decent mind using citizen because he killed the "pimp" of the town and so he's all paid up? Don't buy. Unless you like it. Then throw all your movies away because the probably are not very good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>new twist to the old rush!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is a good time pass. It intrigues the life that we now began to accept about the US.It was one of the best (almost real life) drama for the year 2005. Better than the range of fictitious life and stories that has taken over the center stage of cinema today. Lord of the rings, Star Wars etc.Good photography and action scenes combined with the Michigan backdrop ruled the story.Wonder, if the director purposely choose to show so many non-popular faces. It leaves a good impact.A movie of this kind can take place in any city of the world. How about a series with popular cities. Go GLOBAL! nobody has done it before!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Started out well and then tanked</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie showed promise in the first 15 minutes, but Singleton proceeded to lay on some heavy cheese shortly thereafter. The entire movie was predictable, poorly directed and clichéd. The only saving grace was the acting talent of the primary cast. There were some moments where the brother's camaraderie felt forced, but lighter moments reflected a real family bond. In summary, the movie felt forced. It could have been much better if Singleton focused more on a quality script, and additional character development. They made sure to squeeze in a 'brother' reference in almost every scene. John, we get it- they're brothers. Stop beating me over the head with it.What could have been a strong action drama about love, loss and revenge turned into a poorly directed violent after-school special.One area which particular shone was Andre 3000. I thought he was surprisingly talented. I would like to see him in other roles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was awful. It had no socially redeeming value. The plot was implausible and stupid. The violence was gratuitous. What happened to good guys? There were no good guys at all in this movie. Everyone in the movie had some serious moral failing. The brothers brutally murdered others and showed absolutely no remorse or met any consequences. I guess the movie is teaching that everyone can kill indiscriminately and get away with it. The director is reportedly recorded to have compared this to a Western. I don't think John Wayne, Roy Rogers or the great Ronald Reagan would consider this garbage comparable to any of the Westerns in which they starred. This movie was horrific and had taught only bad morals. Once again, liberal Hollywood has no clue as to what the heartland considers moral. Unfortunately, this movie was the number one box office movie this weekend and the theater where I viewed it was packed. I don't understand why anyone would find this tripe entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts out big, ends up small</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has some great things about it. In its story of four adopted sons of a passionate dogooder ("lost causes" loved by no one in the world but her; she's as true a saint as any of Rossellini's or Von Trier's) returning home for their mother's funeral after she is murdered as a witness to a petty robbery, it is nearly Shakespearian in its tragic scale. But when these brothers in everything but blood lose sight of everything their mother stood for and the movie dissolves into a macho (and egregiously sexist) revenge caper, all of that early power is sacrificed. The mother's "ghost" appears to each of them in turn (more Shakespeare), but only--get this--to warmly remind them of their table manners. Singleton abandons this audacious device when it could do the most good: where is she when her sons are ignoring everything she ever taught them, and executing in cold blood the men they believe to have killed her? This tragedy of failed character is not acknowledged by anyone, least of all the director John Singleton; instead it is celebrated. After the adrenaline ride Four Brothers took me on--the nighttime carchase/shootout in an urban blizzard is absolutely stunning--the movie ended leaving me feeling sad. Sad for the boys, and sad for the mother.The sacrifice of one of the brothers, and of any character and honor the mother's love might have helped these boys build, for a murderous campaign carried out in her name, is the true--but overlooked--tragedy of this story. It could have been a much larger movie if Singleton had continued to use the mother's "ghost" as a device to show that the brothers were at least aware that what they were doing was out of anger and revenge, and would have been against her wishes. There was none of that kind of dialog. What could have been grand tragedy in the tradition of John Ford, becomes instead a hollow Charles Bronson fantasy. No; THAT'S the real tragedy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Please Please don't see this Movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Whatever you do, DON'T see this movie. It starts out promising but over the next hour or so there is nothing but a bunch of worthless scenes that add nothing to the movie except length. Hardly any cool action in the film, and the "tough guy" attitude the brothers display gets extremely old. It was one of the worst movies I have recently seen and unlike other horrible movies it is NOT entertaining. I kept waiting for something cool to happen but it never did. Similar to just about every movie recently released. This movie is a sorry excuse to put four tough guys on screen and hope something good comes out of it. It is dry, tasteless, and has no plot what so ever. Please, do me a personal favor and never mention this movie out loud...it doesn't deserve it.</fullReview>
