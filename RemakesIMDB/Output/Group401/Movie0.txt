		<shortDescription>Entertaining, but not a movie to remember</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just come back from the cinema, where there was a first premiere on Midsommer.Before the movie I thought that this would be one of the bad teenage horror movies. The trailer gave me the impression that I would expect something like a Friday 13th without the splatter effects. That wasn't what I got.There was a lot of scary effects, and they worked very well. Thumbs up for the sound editing, as you could hear they had been working a lot on it. The plot was kind of straight forward from what you would expect in a teen horror. In the first scene one of the kids kills herself, and over the movie you try to figure out why.Where the movie lagged was specially in the ending. It seems that they tried to copy Scream too much in a way. Through the film there haven't been any action scenes, but in the end it all goes too much action, and the plot reveals itself too fast. Also, some of the young actors could have had more experience, but they had chosen a nice lead with Kristian Leth and also Tuva Novotny who plays the mysterious Swede are doing a great job.All in all not a movie you would remember in some years, but very much entertaining. Should be seen in the cinema, so you don't lose too much of the sound quality and loudness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet another great danish movie..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes the danes has made many great movies the last years. This one was creepy, and gave me chills several times. I don't know why, but very visual mainstream american horror movies never does that. Midsommer has a great story, excellent filming and sound and some very talented young actors.I would suggest this for everyone who likes to get scared.. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Danish scary movie disappointment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS HEREIN**It is not often I see scary movies, and if I do, I try to keep out of the scandinavian region, unless someone really convince me it is a good movie. E.g. Villmark, which was a good movie. I was not forced to see this movie, but I didn't really have anything else to do, so I watched it with an open mind.The movie was okay, I guess. But, when I see scary movies, I expect the scary stuff to have a logical answer to it, and that went all wrong in this movie. No person could have turned those lights on and off, and who believes that there are ghosts? This movie is maybe good if you are 12 or so, but for me it was really a disappointment after seeing a lots of good action comedies from Denmark lately. 4/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nordic version of the Haunted House Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carsten Myllerup uses the classical haunted house plot to create a Nordic version of the horror genre without exposing the audience to gory scenes and exaggerated sound effects. As a replacement the movie offers a more humanitarian atmosphere which bounces between joyful images of youth, nature, friendship and love in contrast with dark and depressive ones supported with claustrophobic close-ups, confusing landscapes and thematic music. Appearing symbols like the boat waiting at the bottom of the cliff, the leading deer and themes of spirituality vs. rationality, urban vs. provincial life at different layers of the movie gives it a richer and deeper understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something memorable? Not in this one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>***MILD SPOILERS*** I watched this movie cause it was announced to be like a new milestone in danish horror, but it is quite a let-down.The film is in itself ok, has a lot of nice ideas. But honestly, the quija boards are a thing of the past and by no means scary anymore. There's so many cliches in this film, a list would be going too far.There's also a couple of very annoying characters aswell, especially the smart*** "Mark" played by equally annoying Jon Lange - I've seen a couple of other flicks with this guy and he isn't acting, he is being himself - nothing more, nothing less....to see him shot in the gutt in the end actually made me cheer...I was waiting for that....kinda cruel thing to say, but nevertheless true..Anyway, a mediocre film, nothing more, nothing less.. And I kinda got my eyes opened for Laura Christensen who is becoming kind of a babe - Saw her in Von Trier's "Kingdom" years ago, but she sure developed in all good ways of the word...Yummi!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look - if not for Tuva Novotny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midsommer is one of the better danish thrillers. Its got okay acting, a nice music score and great locations. The story is actually pretty good and managed to surprise me in the ending, even though the story caused a deja vu. Its like you have seen it all before. None the less it was very well put together. Worth a look! If not for Tuva Novotny. She is one of scandinavias most beautiful women - and she can act!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A True Horror Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was extremely surprised with this movie; as I did not expect anything out of it after watching a couple of "bad" movies being hyped by everyone as really "good" movies, so this one blew me away. The story is amazing and well put that until the last part it leads your thoughts into something else while the truth is at the far opposite side of that part, the acting is almost average except for Tuva Novotny as Linn and Kristian Leth as Christian, as both mastered their characters to the benefit of the movie. The story might not be an original one, but it had a clever twist starting with the mysterious suicide of Sofie, Christian's sister during a friend's party. After-wards, the movie follows the aftermath of the sudden suicide on Christian, his parents as well as his friends who we get to know each one of them in greater details as they all set to travel to Sweden on a regular trip. We'll know of Trine in particular who was a close friend of Sofie and develops an interest in Christian as well during the trip. As their relationship progress, Christian starts to witness a set of unexplained events starting with the car (the lights open by themselves, the car stops at a certain area in the woods...) as well as a small pink toy his sister was holding when she overdosed with pills which keeps appearing in strange locations, every time Christian leaves it safe with him. Then, Christian begins to suspect of Persson, the old guy who lives nearby to the point of searching his house when he was not around, only to discover a little girl's room in the upper level, in a house which has no current children. Christian tells his friends of those occurrences, believing that his sister is trying to contact him, which all attributes to his sadness over the sudden loss of Sofie, except Linn, who encourages him to speak and explore of such events and takes the lead in "playing" a game which tends to interact with ghosts. To the surprise of all of his friends, Christian gets indeed contacted by a ghost of a little girl, named Malin whose her child's room was the one he found at Persson's house, knowing from Linn that the little girl was lost for a while and all the town helped searched for her without much luck. The movie also gets you greatly suspicious of Persson, with his odd behavior, asking about Sofie in a strange manner as well as a disturbingly odd behavior from Trine as well... and Up until that moment, you could not predict the truth, the motives of the little girl's ghost and what its link with Sofie's suicide. The movie gets you clinging to the screen as the truth begins to unfold in an unexpected way... The ending is completely refreshing that is truthfully worth watching especially after the slow middle parts of the movie and all in all, it is an excellent horror movie, that if you are looking for something with a nice plot, far from the mainstream Hollywood tasteless ones, then this movie is the right one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Positive surprise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught a screening of this movie at the Gothenburg Film Festival, and I was pleasantly surprised.I hadn't seen any trailers or anything and didn't know what to expect, except that it was a danish teen-movie. It turned out to be a rather scary little movie, avoiding the worst clichés (although it is nothing new, it twists and turns (except maybe for the ending) and never gets predictable or boring) and it's got beautiful photo and very good music (Carpark North) and sound.I think the actors did a great job all over - but I can't guarantee anything since that may have something to do with me don't speaking danish... :o)I would certainly recommend to see it in a theatre with 800 other people screamin' out loud as I did...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amazing acting by Tuva Novotny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie twice and it's good. It's not one of those movies where you leave the cinema absolutely amazed. But it was entertaining and scary, which was what I expected. The acting went from amazing to average/bad. A couple of the Danes, who had this movie as their debut movie, looked almost bad on the screen. You could easily see they almost didn't have an experience in the acting area. Lucky it wasn't any of the lead characters. The lead character which was played by Kristian Leth, was very good. He might not have been in a lot of movies, but he did the job very well. Laura Christensen wasn't too good in the beginning of the movie, but after some progress she started too become very good. The Swede, Per Oscarson, did a very good job, considering his rather small part. The one actress that really blew me away was the other Swede, Tuva Novotny, who plays Linn. She's an absolutely AMAZING actress. Which made a lot of the actors look so bad compared to her. Her character was fairly simple, but she still made her character one of the most interesting and enjoyable character. She's definitely an actress I will be looking out for. The movie itself was fairly good. It's main purpose was to be scary and that, I think, was succeded. I found myself being scared often. It's not a different scary movie, it's actually pretty much like any other scary movie, but I still think it made itself a tiny bit different in some way. I didn't become bored at all during the movie and I didn't regret spending my 2 x 7,5$ on this movie. But I most say, that Tuva Novotny's acting made the movie so much better. If she hadn't been in it, I probably wouldn't have gone in to see it for the second time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good Danish thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you expect a Hollywood-like `action &amp; effect'-packed thriller, this is not the movie for you.But it has an excellent storyline, good actors and actresses - even though most of these are debutants. Furthermore the effects are surprisingly well made, and I personally got quite a few shocks during this movie. See it. It's excellent!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kristian Leth should get an Oscar!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is Kristian Leth the greatest actor I have ever seen? Most probably - he puts people like Alan Rickman, Robert De Niro and Kevin Costner to shame!The script stinks however, but amazingly Leth holds it all together - such is his brilliance. It certainly won't be too long until someone like Tarantino or Woo snaps this guy up.Overall I'd give the film 8.9/10. Without Leth it probably would only receive 3.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just when you thought it was safe to go back to Danish cinema...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Midsummer(or Midsommer, as it is called in Danish). What an astoundingly unremarkable attempt at a horror flick. Danish films are very rarely any good at all, and our horror films are probably the biggest embarrassments. I decided to check this film out, as a friend of mine had it, and I could borrow it for free. I knew pretty much what the film was about, and was aware that it wasn't particularly good. When I sat down to see it, I immediately had the same gut feeling that I usually have when I (attempt to) watch a Danish film. This film never really got my interest, and certainly didn't keep it at any point. The plot is poor, and the way it evolved was so clichéd and predictable. In fact, the whole film was predictable and dull. The acting is bad. Nothing else to say. It is just plain bad. The characters are poorly written, even more poorly developed and paper-thin. They are stereotypical as well. The script is incredibly poor, and the shocks are cheap. The film seems overly loud, and about half of the scenes involve the characters drinking alcohol. Are we supposed to care if these people live or die? All they do is drink. Their actions didn't seem to make sense half of the time, either. I barely payed attention to the film, but I could make out that much. I'm not entirely sure how it ends, and frankly, I don't care the least bit. One to avoid. I recommend this only to big fans of Danish films(which would have to be Danish people who can't speak English, since everyone else prefer to watch films that involve actual talent in their production). 5/10</fullReview>
