		<shortDescription>Solstice (2008) has that professional quality in a mid range budget movie. But, its rated PG.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is almost like that of What Lies Beneath, but played amongst teenagers. Very well made, the acting is authentic, characters are diverse and the plot doesn't give in till the end. The camera work and editing is very smooth, and not overdone, the sound effects as well. All in all you would enjoy this movie and worth your money.The down side for those thrill seekers and horror fans, is there is zero suspense, and no jolts, not even with the sound effects. It's more on the drama side. The Sixth Sense is far more scarier than this. And for those who likes skins, well, although all of the actors and actress are very good looking there is no part in the movie that could turn you on, RATED PG!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad teen chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't really understand why this is a direct-to-video flick, as it had high production quality, familiar faces from TV, and a plot straight out of a Christopher Pike or R.L. Stein book. (Do those guys still put out books? I'm dating myself, but I used to read that junk 15 years ago.) Anyway, it was fairly predictable and certainly not very scary, but benefited from the always-fantastic atmosphere of back-woods Louisiana. Seriously, I think all horror movies should be set in the swamps of Louisiana. Much like Skeleton Key and Venom, Solstice probably gets a whole extra star for location alone.The "teens" were all easy on the eyes (most of the actors are in their late twenties, but whatever) and performances were adequate at worst.I'd give Solstice a 6 out of 10, considering it a teen chiller as opposed to a real horror movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Six months after the suicide of her twin sister Sofie (Elisabeth Harnois), Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) still grieves her death and misses her beloved sister. In the Saint John's Eve, Megan travels with her friends Christian (Shawn Ashmore), Zoe (Amanda Seyfried), Mark (Matt O'Leary) and Alicia (Hilarie Burton) to her family's house in Nowell Lake, Louisiana, to celebrate the summer solstice. While shopping supplies in a local store, Megan befriends the seller Nick (Tyler Hoechlin) and buys a magazine with an article about communication with the dead in the summer solstice, the time of year when there is the greatest length of daylight. While in her house, Megan is haunted by a spirit that she believes is Sofie trying to communicate with her. In her investigation, she suspects of the weird hick Leonard (R. Lee Ermey) and while snooping in his house, she finds the picture of the missing girl Malin (Jenna Hildebrand) and unravels a dark secret about the suicide of her sister.The low-budget "Solstice" was a great surprise with a consistent story, solid screenplay and good acting. The original story startles in many moments without gore, and the young team of gorgeous actresses and handsome actors has great performances. I was expecting to see another slasher teen horror movie and found a pleasant surprise. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whilst it's a good film, it's one of the tamest "horror" movies I have seen in a long, long time...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've just finished watching an early release of Solstice, and I have mixed feelings towards the film overall. I have been awaiting the movie for a while, and whilst I am thankful the overall movie is actually good - I can't help but feel disappointed at the same time. Perhaps I went in expecting a horror film? Because that is not what I got while watching Solstice. Solstice is one of the tamest horror films I have seen in a long, long time as a huge horror fan, and even "The Messengers" has more violence than this. That's saying something.The movie tells the story about Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) who heads away with her friends for the weekend after the suicide of her twin sister. However, Megan begins to receive disturbances which she believes to be caused by her deceased twin and sets out to uncover the truth. I like the plot, it's interesting and one of the reasons I watched the film.I'll start with the positives here, as this is a good film. The movie has a great range of actors who all deliver great performances. I was particularly impressed with Hilarie Burton, as she had a great, bitchy character to work with. R. Lee Ermey also has a cameo role, and while it could have been expanded - he is good, as expected. The movie also starts off pretty strong and the characters are likable, and the plot is interesting to watch. The only other movie released recently about female twins was "I Know Who Killed Me", so I had to see what Solstice had to offer.However, Solstice advertises itself as a horror movie, but quite frankly - it really isn't. Just because it has a plot involving a ghost doesn't mean it is a horror film, as this movie does not feel like a horror film apart from very few drops of blood and a few shots of a ghost. There is minimal violence in the film and minimal blood and gore, but I expected this because of the films rating. If you thought The Messengers, The Fog remake and many others were tame...wait until you see this! I mean, there was hardly any suspense or tension either. I hardly call a cars headlights going on and off suspenseful, do you? Maybe once - yes, but when they use these kind of things dozens of times in a row in this movie...it's like a "wtf" moment. This is probably when you'll realize that this is the most "horror" this movie has to offer...yet again, headlights turning on and off isn't exactly scary is it?!I just think Solstice ultimately suffered in the horror department. This is still supposed to be a horror movie, and it still needed the suspense, violence and more. It had literally nothing apart from a few ghostly images and a bit of violence near the end...and thats what disappointed me the most. I wouldn't classify this as a horror movie because it just doesn't feel like one. Even when the supposed "horror" comes, it takes a while and it's just really the lead female character being creeped out over and over again by cars, cuddly toys and nightmares. It more-or-less feels like a teen drama like "The OC" with some kind of "Halloween Special", or maybe even a Goosebumps episode. It's a good movie, but it needed more horror! a lot more actually!6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Out in the marshlands, where the ghosts are restless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In these recent years we've seen so many horror films with one crazy plot twist after another and presenting us convoluted story lines and deranged denouements. So how surprised I was to discover that SOLSTICE manages to tell a ghostly mystery plot that is so basic and simple, it actually turned into a solid and engaging film. The mystery develops slow but steady. There's practically no shocks or gore, but the film didn't need all that. And there's only one twist featured within the film, but it's a good one. The mood and atmosphere are tense. The cinematography looks great. The swamp and woods settings are wonderful and creepy at the same time. Veteran actor R. Lee Ermey has a small role, but his character actually has weight. Young actress Elisabeth Harnois plays a double role (Megan has a twin sister Sophie who's suicide becomes the core of the mystery) and I'd really love to see more of her. Aside from being beautiful, she's also perfectly capable of carrying this film with her lead performance. I thoroughly enjoyed SOLSTICE because it's very effective without over-doing things. I even liked the ending, which for once does not include the whole cast being slaughtered at the end of the film or a crazy twist still killing off the protagonist unexpectedly. That would have been too easy and predictable. The way things come to a conclusion now, makes it a better film, separating itself from the obvious ones. To give you an idea, I thought SOLSTICE was better than recent films like THE MARSH (2006) and BENEATH (2007).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good mystery, not a good horror film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After the death of her twin sister Sophie, Megan heads of for a few days with her friends. However, on arrival at the family cottage, Megan begins to experience visions and dreams. Is her sister trying to reach out to her from the dead, or is it something else....?Directed by Daniel Myrick, who co-directed The Blair Witch Project, Solstice has many things going for it. The cast are pretty good, with special mention to Elisabeth Harnois, as Sophie/Megan. On screen pretty much the whole film, meaning the film stands or falls on her being convincing, and she is very good indeed.The setting does give the film a nice atmosphere, and the story has enough of a mystery about it to keep you interested until the end.But as a film that is supposed to be a horror film, Solstice fails. Yes the setting is atmospheric, but none of the so-called scare scenes work at all. Myrick, who has made scarier films, doesn't pull of the scares here at all. In fact, I think the film would have been better as a mystery-type film, dropping the horror elements completely.Despite this though, I did enjoy it, and while it will never be remembered as a classic or highly regarded, I was never bored at any point and found it to be an enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty entertaining</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1999,The Blair Witch Project provoked a worldwide commotion because of its original (by that time) concept and for its minimalistic style.I liked that movie very much for being so innovative and for scaring me pretty much.After that,directors Daniel Myrick and Eduardo Sánchez seemed to have a brilliant future in the horror genre.But,it was not like that : they separated as a creative team and their following movies had a low-profile because they were made to the straight-to-DVD market and not many people know of their existence.By my point of view,their movies overcome the average of horror films made straight-to-DVD and,in spite of not being at the same level of The Blair Witch Project,I liked them pretty much.Now,we have Solstice,Myrick's most recent film and I also liked it pretty much.Solstice combines common clichés of different generations of ghosts movies pretty well,from the dark and Gothic atmosphere of Don't Look Now,to the ambiguous ghosts of the modern Asian horror cinema; fortunately,the movie uses that clichés with moderation and they are not used in an arbitrary way,but they are used as tools for telling an interesting and logic story,whose solid development and realistic characters lead to an unexpected ending which works very well.I also appreciated Myrick's restrained direction and the attractive cinematography.One of the few fails I found on this movie are the special effects because they do not produce too much impact.The cast is another good point from this movie,because everybody brings credible performances; I think the ones who mostly stand out are Elisabeth Harnois,Amanda Seyfried and the great R. Lee Ermey.Solstice is not a great movie and it's far away from it.But it brought me an interesting and very entertaining experience which concludes on a very satisfactory ending because it closes the story very well and it does not leave any plot holes or things without an explanation.In summary,Solstice is a very good horror film and I recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, but Not Perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay, so this movie went straight to DVD, which would have many people assuming that it can't be all that great, and while it wasn't the best horror movie I've ever seen it wasn't bad at all. Despite what I've read, it had really good pacing with a number of creepy scenes spread out in the movie enough to keep one interested and slightly creeped out. The acting really helps too and you can see all the inner conflicts of the two main characters as they struggle to come to terms with what they're dealing with. The only thing I didn't like was the way the climax of the movie ended. The rest of the climax is great, but the resolution...not what I would have done. All in all, this movie was worth watching and I'm glad I saw it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, those are the words that come to my mind when I think of Solstice.How many times before a story following that same sort of plot has been told ? Zillions! Why ghost stories only know how to tell one type of story: Mysterious things happen. A particular person start to see and feel odd things. Is it a message from the "other side"? Nobody believes anything this particular person says. Then in the end of the movie the whole thing becomes clear after one or two plot twists. The body of the wandering ghost is found and then she/he can rest in peace, and justice is made finally. Solstice has a nice production, but that is it. The story sucks. It is weak, deja-vu all over again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say I really enjoyed this movie,I thought the acting was really good and the story was good. But I wouldn't say that its a Horror movie you may jump a couple of times because you weren't ready for something to happen but its nothing "scary" in the sense that its a lot of gore or things that are often in horror movies I'd say its the music and the sound affects that does most of the so called "scare" but I would say its a really good thriller! I also like it because the movie didn't die of in part of the movie like it does in many movies. its really consistent all through the movie, witch is important so you don't get bored or sit and wait for something to happen. An overall good thriller well worth watching! Its a 7/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Creepy in places but nothing new</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK this is no classic but it's not suppose to be one. The storyline is a group of kids go to a cabin after one of the kid's twin sister commits suicide under mysterious circumstances. As soon as they arrive, they get haunted by a creepy ghost. It is also a remake but I haven't seen the original so I cannot compare this film to it.I think all the actors do a decent job though R. Lee Ermey definitely steals the show as a creepy resident in the woods. I think what I like about his character is the mystery that he carries with him which is what keeps me interested in finding out what his deal is. With the exception of his character, everyone else seems rather dull mostly because they have been done before with many other horror movies. You have the good girl who is the main character, the love interest who maybe holding a deadly secret and there is the joker who is a bit of a jerk. It's all too traditional to be but the performances of all the actors does make them very believable that you can see past those traditional clichés of the characters.The film doesn't deliver a great deal of scares but when it does, they really work and that is best thing about this film. The ghost is very creepy looking and the story does keep you hooked as the characters try to find out the mystery of what it is that is haunting them and why the ghost is doing it. As in most nowadays ghosts films, it is all about what has happened to them that has caused them to be dead which I have no problem with just so long as the twist is something new which I found the revelation of the main villain who caused the ghost's death to be rather obvious but the identity of the ghost was a surprise. This was because the film would tease you to believe that the ghost was the main character's twin sister but it turns out to be someone different.Overall, the film isn't very original but it does have some qualities such as believable performances, a surprising twist and some eerie scenes that should keep most ghost story fans hooked but don't expect anything new.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just another teen chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before I start, I'd like to make it clear that I didn't hate this movie, but I hated the enormous amount of annoying clichés. To be fair, this is by some means understandable, considering that we're talking about the classic horror formula for the young audiences that involves a group of young friends taking a trip to the middle of nowhere. Personally, I have nothing against these types of films, but in this case, my problem is that even though I can tolerate typical clichés, a movie should always offer something particularly good to praise. Unfortunately, this is not the case. 'Solstice' is your average teenage flick, with nothing good enough to remain in our memory. It's a plain horror flick that I'm already forgetting, even though I saw it less than 24 hours ago.The story is about a troubled young girl named Megan, whose sister Sofie committed suicide for unknown reasons. Troubled and fragile as she is, Megan still thinks it would be a great idea to take a trip to her family house to celebrate the summer solstice. Her moronic friends are invited, of course, including her sister's ex boyfriend (who by the way, has a crush on her). As soon as they arrive, Megan begins to have some horrible visions and also sees a dark figure (a spirit) lurking around the house, which she believes is Sofie. In the meantime, her friends try to convince her that she's just having a hard time dealing with the situation, but the poor girl still goes out of her way to find out if her dead sister is actually trying to tell her something. Great news for Megan!: apparently, the summer solstice is supposed to be the most convenient time of year to communicate with the dead... so guess what? Exactly. All the stupid teenagers, reluctantly set up a circle to have a nice conversation with dead Sofie. Because you know what the say: it's not a kick-ass trip until you invoke a spirit from the beyond.Basically, the story has been done many times before, but there are some variations, of course. Personally, I don't mind that. I firmly believe that you can make a great horror movie with a worn out plot, if you create the right atmosphere, with the right characters and at least ONE memorable thing. Unfortunately, this is not the case and like I said before, the problem with this film, is the amount of repetitive situations that only produce a strong desire to fast forward. Example? all right: the typical situations of "Oh my god! I packed this a while ago!, how come it's here again! spirits from the beyond are messing with the things I packed!! (yawn) And you know what's the best part? all right, in many horror movies, the main character is haunted by a specific object that belonged to someone who died. Example: In 'The Changeling' George Scott always sees a small rubber ball that belonged to his late daughter. Well, in 'Solstice', Megan is haunted by... a bear keyring! yes, ladies and gentlemen, that's right, a bear keyring! I could never really get over the image of the ridiculous little bear in what was supposed to be freaky."Solstcide" offers a vast quantity of pointless scenes full of scares and ineffective chills that lead to nothing at all. Perhaps they wouldn't be completely pointless if they helped to build an atmosphere of fear and tension, but in this case, it's mostly tedious. The only interesting parts of the movie are the ones that involve the local creepy old man and his background story. As the movie goes, we see a few things about this character, that help to build some intrigue. Then, we have some flashback and premonitory visions that are incredibly artsy and dark, which I appreciated a lot. These morbid visions are a way to tell what happened in the past and unravel little by little the intriguing parts of the story. So basically, these flashbacks are not only nice to look at, but also, pretty much one of the main reasons why this movie got my attention in any way. The ending is somehow fulfilling and a bit surprising, although not quite enough to redeem the movie entirely. But if I have to be nice and focus on the good aspect of it: the final revelations and the minutes of the film in which the big mysteries are revealed and resolved, were pretty interesting, actually. It has a twist, but not an excessive and far-fetched twist. So my humble advice is: watch the movie if you're in the mood for a teen chiller, but don't expect anything grandiose, because you won't find it in this film. And just because it was directed by one of the guys who directed 'The Blair Witch Project', don't expect anything even remotely comparable, because that will be your worst disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blair witch goes more traditional</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Daniel Myrick who brought us The Blair Witch Project is going with a more traditional horror movie. However without a gimmick, this gives few scares and little suspense.This one stars some pretty good actors, Elisabeth Harnois, Shawn Ashmore, Hilarie Burton and Amanda Seyfried. Although I liked all the actors, the characters have little chemistry. This is more due to a very bland script. The ghost story has very few scary moments. The reveal lacks any tension or satisfaction. If not for the likable actors, I wouldn't care about anything in this movie. It is simply forgettable. Nothing annoying or offensive. Just bland.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enough with PG-13 horror movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is what you get when you try to stretch a paragraphs' worth of plot and about two sentences' worth of characterization into a hour-and-a-half story. This ghostly tale is equal parts dumb and boring and the few cheap scares it musters up can't compete with a plethora of astoundingly contrived scenes and a near total lack of recognizable human behavior.6 months after her twin sister committed suicide, Megan (Elisabeth Harnois) and her 4 friends head out to a big house in the Louisiana swamps to celebrate the Summer Solstice before heading off to college in the fall. While she's there, Megan is tormented by frightening visions that revolve around a teddy bear key chain her sister always carried around. What looks like the girl from the well in The Ring movies also shows up a couple of times. After boinking her dead sister's ex-boyfriend and making goo goo eyes at a handsome local who knows a little cajun voodoo, Megan finally discovers the reason she's being haunted and how it's connected to a creepy redneck who lives across the lake.From teenagers putting on suits and ties to hold a dinner party to a huge house in the swamp that's perfectly maintained without a caretaker, from a plot twist that makes you want to throw something at the screen to one of Megan's friends looking like a preppie who escaped from a 1980s sex comedy (including wearing a polo shirt with an upturned collar), there's nothing about this film that makes sense or resembles anything like reality. These filmmakers took a very old and very clichéd ghost story that everyone's heard before and just started stapling stupid stuff onto it.There are 7 characters in the story, yet they don't even have one personality among them. The film throws a few dream sequences at the audience but never defines exactly when they begin. So when the dream sequences end, you're not sure what actually happened and what was the dream. There's a series of flashbacks to the night Megan's sister killed herself, but there's no connection between what's going on in the story and when we see the flashbacks. It's not like something happens that makes Megan or someone else remember that night. The flashbacks are just inserted into the film, like little bathroom breaks for the viewer. You certainly can take a whiz anytime a flashback happens, because none of them contribute anything to the story.If its cast of attractive young people had at least gotten naked a few times, Solstice might have been almost tolerable. If R. Lee Ermey had gone the full monty, it might have become horrifically irresistible. As it is, Solstice is just another PG-13 horror flick where the only horrifying thing about it is that I paid money to watch this piece of crap.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what the budget was for Solstice, but no one is complaining about it's technical merits. It looks and sounds as shiny as an MTV video of the year. The cast is young and attractive--I would say they looked like they were straight out of a Noxema commercial, but I don't think those are around anymore. The plot contains a secret at the end and not much leading up to it, but that won't bother the target audience. If only there was a memorable villain, like Chucky or Jason, so that the kindergärtners whose parents allow them to watch anything and everything, could remember something to talk about with their friends. At least Jeepers Creepers had that flying scarecrow. The kid who played Iceman in "X-men" and the dumb girl from "Mean Girls" take a vacation to the middle of nowhere with a group of friends. Central to this story is Megan, who needs some time away to deal with the recent death of her twin sister. Except that she is having visions and experiencing unexplained occurrences that seem to be some sort of communication from the undead. Is it her sister trying to tell her something? Or are the messages coming from the innocent girl that Iceman killed last summer and then buried without telling anyone?You will only think this movie is original, well-written, or well-acted if you haven't watched very many movies. In which case, you won't care--you and your friends will be more geeked about having scored that six-pack earlier in the evening than anything that happens in any video you might be renting tonight.</fullReview>

Haunted by the past, she has a series of visions. She is also creeped out by an old vagrant, played by R.

		<shortDescription>Another straight to DVD CGI ghost film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SOLSTICE couldn't get anymore ordinary if it tried. It's a tale which sees a group of twentysomething friends traveling into the sticks to celebrate the summer solstice. One of the group is tormented by her sister's suicide from years before, so when she begins to experience strange supernatural events at the house they're staying at, she thinks her sister's ghost is trying to communicate.Of course, it's not her sister's ghost at all, but something far more sinister as a back story is gradually revealed to viewers. Unfortunately SOLSTICE for the most part is uninteresting, because the events that play out are so darned familiar. There are taps that run mud and CGI ghosts hanging about behind people, and it's all well telegraphed so that there's nary a surprising moment. The genre is still stuck with old AMITYVILLE HORROR-type tropes even in this day and age. Even the incessant long-haired ghosts of the J-horror genre are scarier than this.The real surprise is that BLAIR WITCH director Daniel Myrick would make such an ordinary and forgettable film. There are a few familiar faces here - genre regular Shawn Ashmore (FROZEN), who's always a pleasure; the great R. Lee Ermey in a minor "hillbilly" role; a pre-stardom Amanda Seyfried - but the lamentable scare scenes and the oddly uninvolving denouement combine to make this a bore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Megan's twin sister has recently committed suicide, and it was a shock to everyone. She was popular, had a terrific boyfriend, and was on top of the world, no one knew just what happened. To celebrate her memory, her sister and a group of their friends go to their summer house for the weekend, and that's when Megan starts seeing things. Her friends think she's nuts, but Megan feels that her sister is trying to tell her something, so Megan goes on a quest to find answers. Why is it always the low budget films you hear nothing about, that turn out to be the most interesting? I honestly thought this was going to be another weird supernatural slasher film, but it wasn't at all. Solstice gives you so many angles and so many things to focus on, including intense flashbacks, a terrific mystery, a creepy neighbor, a missing child, a love story, and of course attractive people skinny dipping. The focus of the film seems quite evident early on, but it really isn't, as Solstice twists and turns in so many directions, that by the time it's over, you'll be left with your mouth open. The cast comprised of normally ancillary characters was terrific, especially Elisabeth Harnois. Her face may be familiar to film-goers, but not because of any leading roles, she has bided her time, taking small roles, learning as much as she could to use in performance like this one. Solstice was her chance to finally take the reigns and she did it with grace and intensity. The rest of the cast, featuring some well-known teen idols, also doesn't disappoint as Matthew O'Leary was hilarious, Shawn Ashmore was the level headed one, and Tyler Hoechlin was wonderfully weird. As I said early, Solstice is a thriller that has it all, from the supernatural to an earthly mystery, it is one terrific film, that doesn't stay in one place for very long. The rural setting and the way the story is told, with well timed flashbacks, just make everything that more intense. It may be a low budget, independent film, but it's better than anything you'll see on the big screen right now and I can't recommend it enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but flawed supernatural effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hoping to overcome her twins' death, a woman joining her friends on a weekend camping trip starts to believe her ghost is haunting her and her friends to unravel the mysterious events surrounding her death.This is a decent and enjoyable supernatural effort. One of the better parts to this is the set-up here for the ghostly connection, which manages to make it believable that these experiences are happening for once. Rather than simply rely on the traditional manner of loud shock- jumps or boo-scares to sell the point to her, instead here relying more on intuition generated from creepy encounters that build to a fine whole with the two encounters shown here in the scene with her alone in the house or going into the bathroom with the sludge from the faucets and the distractions coming from outside as well as the different encounters shown with her continually-shifting bloody finger-tips which makes for an unnerving tactic by making it pop up from pretty mysterious origins when it's least expected. That is based alongside the running storyline of the reappearing charm as well as incidental scenes with the clogged bathtub or the car's headlights going off-and-on for additional creepy moments that all build the ghostly presence quite well. From there, the final half to this is where all these pay-off nicely as the series of chases through the marsh, the digging in the torrential rainfall and the full revelation of the mystery surrounding it are all brought into clear play which makes for a few chilling moments and some rather enjoyable moments that come into play here. These are enough to help this one overcome the few flaws here, mostly the fact that this one keeps all these ghost encounters to such brief moments which leave this feeling more like a supernatural-themed drama of her pouting about the loss. There's never a sense of really exploiting the ghostly visions since there's so few chances to do this with them bring so brief against the drawn-out drama scenes that it really tends to crawl along quite lethargically for the most part until the finale so these scenes are disrupting that kind of pace for the most part. The other factor with this one that really sticks out here is the rather bland manner as not only is this once against the clichéd notion of being broken up to hide the storyline twist since the mystery of the ghost activities are the central point here but also that there's never a really interest way to get this one sorted out to become all the more watchable. These here hold this one down somewhat.Rated PG-13: Violence, Language and teenage drinking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically well done, but overall I felt it was kind of weak and somewhat predictable... Blu-ray: Pretty Good A:8 V:8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching this, I kind of agonized whether to come here and write a review. I really had high hopes for this one, primarily because I usually really like Supernatural tales or Ghost Stories that are done well, but sadly this one left me a little bit flat (kind of like Chaz Bono)The tricky thing about this movie is that technically it is rather good. The photography and look of the film lend well to the overall mood and atmosphere of the story. It's just that to me personally, in my lowly and wretched opinion, there was just something substantial missing that might have made this film better. Even the acting, which normally can be quite abysmal in these low-budget 'Teen' Horror films, was decent enough with what they had to work with. I don't know... I almost want to say that I got a slightly shallow 'MTV' type of vibe from it, especially with the sound design, but I'm not sure that was quite it...I will say that there were 2 VERY brief moments that I really liked in the film. Without giving anything away, I liked the part where the dog was chasing her into the woods and what happened. Also, and this was like ONE minute only... I liked the old-fashioned / religious sounding choral voices in the soundtrack when they were sitting outside and the main girl got up and left the group and approached the barn-like structure (I also liked the lighting effect that went along with that)I'm thinking that probably the reason they went back and released this older film is because now Amanda Seyfried has become much more famous. I was quite surprised that it was made in 2008! She, was not particularly outstanding in her role, but she was okay. Actually, I felt that the main girl did a much better job (granted, she had a LOT more to do) She kept reminding me of someone (I don't think I have seen her either before or since) It wasn't just her looks, but her expressions and manner. I THINK who she was reminding me of was a younger version of Lisa Kudrow, sort of... Heh, not really relevant I guess, but still it kind of nagged at me while I was watching the film... Anyway, I usually really LOVE a good Cajun / Haitian Voodoo flavoured film. As a matter of fact I just saw the recent 'JESSEBELLE' and really liked it. I think, overall, that film was a better example of creating a more creepy and suspenseful mood and ultimately being more effective than this one. In reading some of the other reviews here, it appears that many people DID indeed find the movie satisfying enough. Most of the reviews and the current ratings seem to land between '5' and '6', which sounds about right to me (I gave it a '5' because it just seemed to fall a bit short in a few areas)As far as whether to recommend this to others as a 'Good' film, that would have to be based I guess on how demanding you are with these types of movies. Definitely, if you don't really go for Supernatural or Ghost Stories that much, then for sure give this one a pass... But, if you do like those types of films and if you are not expecting TOO much, then you might enjoy this one somewhat. But honestly, I personally just found it a bit weak. And I really do think that there are similar but much better films than this out there...</fullReview>

I will keep it short, since there is very little to tell. This is not an horror movie, it is a mystery talking about a group of teenagers spending a few days in a house in the wood. There is really nothing impressive, storyline is boring and predictable, there is no gore or scaring scenes, just the acting is pretty decent.

		<fullReview>Megan's sister dies, she commits suicide and no one know why she made this gesture. Trying to forget this tragedy her along with three friends go to a house in the forest to a city with very few inhabitants. But here she starts to have some visions and thinks that her sister is trying to transmit something. How everyone else believes that she is crazy it's now up to her to find the message using the signs which she receives. At the same time she has memories of the past where she was at a party with her friends and also using these visions will have to put them together to find the truth. But what will find will lead her to something else than she could have imagined and that the ex-boyfriend of her sister and who is now her actually BF committed a crime while they were driving and in a moment inadvertently killed an innocent little girl that was on a bike.Solstice is meant to be a horror film but unfortunately sequences that had to scare us are too few and a fan of this genre, this film would not move even a hair from their head. The story is good, I personally liked the beginning but in the process gets frustrating, boring and slow advancing to the outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about the last act</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Solstice" (2008) was made by the creator of "The Blair Witch Project", Daniel Myrick, and is a more conventional horror flick. Like "Blair", "Solstice" takes the subtle route with the creep factor and the typical trappings of slasher or quasi-slasher flicks; so stay away if you need serious gore, sex and nudity with your horror.The film runs 90 minutes and the first hour plays out like myriad other monster/ghost movies -- a group of youths venture to some secluded area to party and tensions increase as the creep factor increases. What separates "Solstice" from, say, most of the Friday the 13th flicks, besides lack of gore, is the serious and realistic vibe of the proceedings. While this is welcomed by me, it also makes for a less entertaining viewing -- for the first hour, that is.The last half hour is where everything comes together and there's almost a Wow factor as you realize what's really going on and what happened, etc.While the cast are all no-names, except Amanda Seyfried (who wasn't that well-known at the time), they're effective enough. They could've done better with the women, but the main protagonist is decent, Elisabeth Harnois.The film was shot in Louisiana.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Talking to the moon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, this movie was incorrectly translated to "Talking to the dead" in my language, which is a BIG let down, considering that there is no talking to any dead people in this movie. By the first seven minutes of movie, director already tries to scare the spectator, even thought there is nothing relevant in the plot to do that. As the movies goes, I couldn't say if it was gonna be a good movie or not; when people get together in the lake to talk to the dead, I thought the movie would go somewhere interesting. However, from that scene on, everything went downhill. I sincerely hoped Mr. Vorhees just came in and killed everyone for being so annoying! However, in a point I thought I was seeing the lazy "I Know What You Did Last Summer". Not to mention the clichéd false scares the characters (tried to) provoke us all the time. Moreover, the ending is simply incomplete and answers nothing; everything you wanted to know or understand during the movie ends up just like that. Bad movie anyways. Fours stars in respect to some actors involved in this mess.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice "Ghost Story"/"Teen Slasher" sun-genre combo!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me, Solstice has been a rather positive surprise. As a devout fan of the Horror genre and almost all its sub-genres, I watch many Horror films, sometimes a few in one week, and with the genre being as "Hollywoodly" neglected as it is (at least quality-wise) I come across many mediocre films, or worse. Lowered expectations have become the finest tool for us horror fans. Unfortunate, but true. Having said that - being a Horror fan does have it's rare special moments and perks, and Solstice has been just one these.Solstice's true innovative and original genius is, in my opinion, its combining of two sub-genres: Ghost Stories and Teen Slashers. While the Ghost Story part is pretty straight forward, the Teen Slasher bit has some pretty nice features that differentiate it. For instance with no spoilers - the guy in the gas station isn't an old redneck, and the usual roles of the characters (jerk, hottie, good guy and such) get rather scrambled at some point.The story and build-up are good enough, creating interest and sympathy, and the acting is also pretty decent by all the cast. Always nice seeing Ice Man Shawn Ashmore in other roles. The plot is well thought of, and the twist has really taken me by surprise!While I can't point my finger to anything specifically wrong, I can say that while Solstice is good, it isn't great and could have been better (but how many films can you name that couldn't have?). Devout fans of the genre would really enjoy the cross-genre, and all in all the film itself has been fun to watch. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally felt that the story had some familiarity but also a bit of originality to it as well. The acting was reasonable for a teen crew, cinematography was good, and the score was eerie enough to keep it interesting. I agree with another poster who said this was more a mystery movie than a horror movie and it definitely had a "noir-ish" atmosphere to it. Also - completely irrelevant, but did anyone else think that Elisabeth Harnois looks like Taylor Swift?I watched the movie from a R1 DVD with 5.1 audio (released by Alliance) and thought the mix was quite good. The DVD itself is pretty bare-bones with no real special features other than an audio commentary; kind of disappointing as it would have been neat to see a featurette on New Orleans post-Katrina in the area the movie was filmed. I couldn't help thinking of "The Skeleton Key" - another mystery/suspense movie filmed in New Orleans as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nifty supernatural horror thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Six months after the suicide death of her twin sister Sophie, the troubled Megan (a fine and sympathetic performance by Elisabeth Harnois) travels with her friends to her family's house in Nowell Lake, Louisiana. While staying in said abode Megan uncovers a disturbing secret about her sister's untimely death. Director Daniel Myrick, who also co-wrote the compelling script with Martin Musatov and Ethal Erwin, relates the engrossing story at a steady pace, adroitly creates and sustains a spooky atmosphere, delivers a vivid and pungent evocation of the swampy rural setting, offers a few genuinely creepy visuals, and pulls out the stirring stops for the surprising and suspenseful conclusion. Moreover, Myrick deserves extra kudos for putting a welcome and refreshing emphasis on mood, plot, and characters over gore and cheap scares. The sturdy acting by the able cast rates as another major asset: Shawn Ashmore as Megan's nice guy boyfriend Christian, Amanda Seyfried as Megan's sweet and supportive best gal pal Zoe, Hilarie Burton as the brassy Alicia, Matt O'Leary as sarcastic jerk Mark, and Tyler Hoechlin as friendly and helpful local Nick. Veteran character actor R. Lee Ermey makes a strong impression in a small, but pivotal part as crusty farmer Leonard. Jane Antonio Cornish's shivery score does the ominous trick. M. David Mullen's striking cinematography comes through with a wealth of stunning images and gives the picture a pleasing glossy look. A worthwhile little chiller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solstice : A PG-13 Teenage Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first watched this movie when i bought it a couple of months back and i was excited to see that is rated PG-13, which told me that its not going to be a gore flick with a lot of horror violence, but a creepy teenage thriller. It is spooky and harrowing. Im a huge horror buff, but I occasionally like some non violent and supernatural flicks. Solstice featured a spooky story line and a great teenage cast, including Elisabeth Harnois(90210 and One Tree Hill), Shawn Ashmore(The Ruins), Hilarie Burton(One Tree Hill and The Secret Life of Bees), Amanda Seyfried(Alpha Dog, Mean Girls and the Upcoming 2009 Teenage Horror Flick Jennifer's Body), Matt O'Leary(Death Sentence and 2009's Sorority Row) and Tyler Hoechlin(Grizzly Rage and 7th Heaven). This flick has all of the horror elements, like a group of friends celebrating at a house in the wilderness and then being terrorized by a masked killer, only this one has a supernatural twist to it. A group of close friends decide to spend the weekend at a friends family's home deep in the wilderness to celebrate their graduation, only to be caught up in a series of supernatural occurrences and an ancient voodoo ceremony, that places the friends in mortal danger. They must discover the dark secret that binds them together and the recent death of their friend. This movie terrified me and I definitely recommend it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pretty Average Thriller Of No Great Note</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have here another thriller in which a bunch of young people head out into the middle of nowhere and find themselves stuck in a "scary" situation. What I will say in favour of this movie is that at least it avoided the cliché of having some type of cannibalistic mass murderer out to get them (a cliché that was actually mentioned by one of the characters when they met up with the creepy old guy from the other side of the lake.) In this case, we have young Megan, still tormented by the suicide of her twin sister six months before, heading off with a bunch of her friends on their annual trip to celebrate the summer solstice in the Bayou of Louisiana. Why they do this wasn't entirely clear to me, except that Megan's mom is some sort of anthropologist or something who specializes in culture and so apparently they celebrate every holiday known to humanity (which is a pretty nice gig if you can get it!) Once they're in the Bayou, Megan starts to have visions which she thinks are of her sister, and she discovers in a magazine (quite conveniently) that the summer solstice is the perfect time to contact the dead. She also conveniently runs into a local hunk of a grocery store clerk who happens to know how to contact the dead because his grandmother was involved in voodoo. I'm not kidding.Now, as truly silly as that all seems, I have to say that, while it's full of mostly forgettable (although not bad) performances, this movie isn't terrible. There's a pretty decent buildup of the intrigue and suspense until the final secret which finally connects both Megan's visions and the creepy old guy is revealed, but you do have to get through a lot of pretty cliché type situations to get there. As a timewaster this isn't bad, but if you want a really good thriller, this is not going to satisfy at all. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another boring, predictable teenage ghost story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I watched this movie, I was struck by how bland, boring, and predictable it was. It was never actually bad or anything, but it was arguably memorable for being so forgettable. It was only after I came to the IMDb that I discovered it was directed by one of the guys responsible for that utter borefest, The Blair Witch Project. At that moment, everything made sense to me, and I felt totally vindicated in my intense dislike for TBWP (which all my friends, at the time, seemed to think was pure genius). I also realized that this director had done The Believers, which was, unsurprisingly, a bit of a borefest, though the ending was kind of cool (even though it was stolen from a Arthur C. Clarke story). Unfortunately, this movie doesn't really have an interesting twist to save it, unless you're really, really unfamiliar with the last 50 years worth of ghost stories coming out of Hollywood.Eduardo Sanchez, the co-director of TBWP, made a pretty good movie a few years ago, called Altered, about a group of friends who have a really nasty series of run-ins with malevolent aliens. Unlike this one, I walked in to that movie thinking it was going to be crap, but I was quite surprised at how much I liked it. It was suspenseful, gory, and, while it wasn't really original, it still managed to put its own spin on a common theme (alien abduction). Really, it was more a movie about rape than anything else, couched in science fiction/horror elements. This movie? It's exactly what it looks like -- a group of stupid teenagers (played by 30 year old actors, of course), including a depressed girl, the depressed girl's best friend, an insensitive jerk, the insensitive jerk's long-suffering girlfriend, and the depressed girl's love interest (who also happens to be her dead twin sister's ex-boyfriend), spend about 70 minutes getting drunk, followed by about 15-20 minutes of plot, wherein they follow the psychic intuitions of the depressed girl, only to solve a Scooby Doo mystery. Unfortunately, this movie has all the thrills, mystery, and suspense of your average Scooby Doo episode, perhaps due to the PG rating. Amusingly, the ghosts ended up just standing around, in the background, looking as bored as I felt, while I was watching this movie.Prepare to be bored to death, rather than scared to death.</fullReview>

It's the same type of ghost story a proper horror fan has seen a gazillion times. And it's a remake! Why? Also, at 87 minutes, this felt like hours. Bo-ring. There are red herrings, scary shadows, MTV-style flashbacks from the dead, and while it's all well done, it's all been done before. Thank you, but no.Myrick had a mediocre movie (Believers, also (V)) and a good one ruined by a terribly miscast main actor and a "gotcha-sucker!" ending (The Objective). At least here, justice was served and this went straight to DVD where it belongs.Eduardo Sanchez' "Altered", although more of a sci-fi horror hybrid on a low budget, is superior to all of the above mentioned films in my opinion. Here's hoping that Myrick (who has loads of talent) will make a proper great movie in the future.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOLSTICE is a remake of a Danish film called MIDSOMMER. I didn't watch the original but it's probably better than this American remake... I mean, SOLSTICE it's not bad for a typical 90's Horror film about ghosts, but it's not beyond average either. It's just right that, an average and unoriginal flick about ghosts, but it's entertaining though.The plot is about a teenage girl who recently lost her twin sister, and when she goes to a rustic house in the woods with her friends to forgot about what happened she start seeing things... ghostly things... She thinks it's her sister, but later she finds out it's not...This thematic about ghosts and the communication with the dead was done and redone so many times that to be great a movie about this theme must be very original and different from what has been done, otherwise it will be just another clichéd horror flick about ghosts. And that's precisely what happens with this SOLSTICE. It brought nothing new or original to the genre, so it's just "another one"...However, it is suspenseful enough, some FX are well done and the soundtrack is nice too, so I score it 5/10.</fullReview>

Things get real bizarre when Megan thinks she is being contacted by her sister from beyond the grave. A local hunk(Tyler Hoechlin)comes to dinner and teaches the group a Creole spell of the summer solstice. They actually try and raise Megan's sister from the dead...not without casualties.

Solstice offered no surprises and parts of the story was really to convenient (thinking specially of one of the characters, if you see the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about).

		<shortDescription>Solstice is Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An adult would find this extremely boring, predictable and immature.If you are 15-17, you would probably enjoy this movie.I would not let anyone under 14 see this movie, because of sexual themes and some shock-value spooks. There is basically no gore, just a bleeding finger.Revenge from the grave is trite and unrealistic and it was done very poorly in this movie. The shove-it-all-down-your-throat ending was expected and not appreciated.I can't say I cared if any of the characters lived or died, they were all irritating and unintelligent.A generous 4 stars is all I can muster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A shockingly boring product, 'Solstice' is perhaps one of the earliest 'by-products' of the Writer's Strike of 2007-2008.When you rent a movie, your basest hope is to derive SOME pleasure from your money spent. 15 minutes pass, you're annoyed and nodding off at the same time, and you wonder if you should hit Fast-Forward or Eject.In this film, the characters lack anything resembling human interest. Their dialog contains zero references to 2008 society or culture. This script could have been written in 1980, or 1970 for that matter! It's a by-the-numbers dull-fest!Want to save a buck on sleeping pills? Watch "Solstice"!</fullReview>
