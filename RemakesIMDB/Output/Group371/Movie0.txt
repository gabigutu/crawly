		<shortDescription>A high camp gem.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must be one of the most under-rated of the Bette Davis films. At its heart is a brilliant screenplay and two extraordinary performances.John Van Druten and Lenore Coffee have taken Van Druten's play and created a camp masterpiece. The lines are nearly as funny as those in "All About Eve" eg "Why do I always look like a ninety-year old hag when I want to look like Shirley Temple."And Bette and Miriam, who apparently hated each other, give stunning performances. Miriam is something of a horror here, all superficial bubble and vicious back-stabbing jealousy. Bette is nicer but can be just as catty. Their scenes together are pure joy. The male characters pale next to these goddesses - it's a wonder they bother with them at all.Don't miss this one - you'll love it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A classic woman's film in the best sense of the word, "Old Acquaintance" was remade by George Cukor as "Rich and Famous" and echoed in the final scenes of Pedro Almodovar's "La Flor de Mi Secreto." Such is the enduring appeal of this tale of a friendship between two women that continues throughout their lives despite rivalries, temperament, and love affairs. Of course with Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins as the women, the film rises from melodramatic soap opera to a higher level. Davis plays Kit, a serious, sensitive writer, whose interests lie principally in her work. Hopkins plays Millie, a self-absorbed woman who envies her friend's success, but is determined to have everything: a writing career, a home, and a family. While Kit writes critically lauded books and plays, Millie produces a steady stream of best selling romantic novels. While Millie becomes wealthy beyond measure, Kit remains appreciated if not rich. However, Kit's warmth attracts the affections of not only Millie's increasingly estranged husband, but also her neglected daughter.Thus, the stage is set for emotional clashes between the two writers that provide Davis and Hopkins with some juicy material. Hopkins in particular chews the scenery, wrings her hands, and emotes outrageously. Davis, on the other hand, underplays her role more than usual, although the Davis eyes and inflections remain. Perhaps she understood that the histrionics of more than one actress would be too much for the audience to bear. However, during one classic outburst, Davis unexpectedly does steal a scene from Hopkins and provoke a startled laugh from the audience. With two strong women at its center, the men in "Old Acquaintance" understandably play support. John Loder is all bland good looks as Millie's husband, and a handsome Gig Young does little besides look handsome and play the too-young romantic interest for Davis.With the exception of Deidre, Hopkins' daughter, the other major female roles also involve working women. Although Davis's maid may be a domestic, she does work and earn her own living. The reporter who interviews Hopkins and Loder is a gender-neutral role, but perhaps to emphasize the centrality of women to the story, another strong actress, Anne Revere, was cast. In fact, besides Loder and Young, most of the men in the film play waiters, taxi drivers, night clerks, playboys, and drunks. Newcomer Dolores Moran, who plays Deidre, was out of her league with Davis and Hopkins and comes across as shallow and unconvincing. Her erotic gyrations to seduce Gig Young in a listening booth and her defiant dalliance with an older playboy are at odds with the character and image of Kit, who was supposedly Deidre's role model.Fast paced, lush, and romantic, "Old Acquaintance" is one of those movies that "they just don't make anymore." The dialog is delicious, the performances occasionally border on camp, and the direction is sure-handed. With a box of chocolates, a wad of Kleenex, and a bottle of flat champagne, Bette and Miriam are the perfect friends for a rainy afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, the stars of the classic 1939 film THE OLD MAID, reunite for this tale which spans twenty years in the love/hate relationship of two female friends who become competitive not only professionally, but in their personal lives as well. This one is a real dandy. Davis is her inimitably intense self, and she's matched all the way by the great Miriam Hopkins who was at her peak on-screen in the '30's. While this is often referred to as Davis' picture, Miriam holds her own. These ladies are truly two of the finest actresses to ever grace the Hollywood screen and deliver Oscar-caliber performances. The confrontation scene where Davis shakes the living daylights out of Hopkins is a high example of art imitating life because Davis and Hopkins weren't exactly the best of friends in real-life either. For some reason, this gem has never been released to video, but naturally the dreadful remake with Candice Bergen and Jacqueline Bissett(RICH AND FAMOUS) has.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Rivalry</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Long before "Beaches" and "The Turning Point", there was the film "Old Acquaintance" (1937?). Focusing on the familiar theme of longtime friendship that is tainted by jealousy and competition, one of the most remarkable things about it is that Davis actually plays the "nice" one this time around. "Old Acquaintance" begins with Kit (Davis), a writer who turns out books that appeal to female intellectuals, returns home to visit her old friend Millie (Hopkins). Kit and Millie basically grew up together, and despite Kit's seriousness and drive and Millie's concern for all things material, the two have forged a friendship that is pretty tight. When we first meet the two, Millie, married and pregnant with her first (and only) child, decides that she too can become an authoress, only she is going to write what she thinks the public wants; torrid potboilers (ala Danielle Steel) that are high on the sappy melodrama, and low on the substance meter. When Millie finds eventual success and becomes extremely wealthy, churning out book after book, her husband Pres (Loder), and child, Didi begin to feel neglected and eschewed, thanks to Millie's highly materialistic and "queen bee" attitude. They both turn to Kit, who has managed to stick around through all of this, Pres falling in love with her, and Didi looking to Kit as a surrogate mother. Despite Kit having reciprocal feelings for Pres, she insists that they can never come to fruition since Millie is her best friend, so he divorces Millie and leaves. Years later, still a success, Millie finds out that Kit and Pres were in love at one point, and despite the fact that neither followed through with their feelings, Millie blames Kit, now an accomplished and respected playwright, eventually turning Didi, now in her late teens, against her. The drama is further heightened when Kit finally agrees to marry Rudd (Young), her younger lover, right when he meets and falls in love with Didi, causing further conflict and heartache until Kit and Millie are left with the prospect of only being left with the other, despite their serious issues over the years.I really enjoyed "Old Acquaintance" because it had all of the elements of a great melodrama; back-stabbing, unrealized and tragic love, Bette Davis. Whether she is playing the good soul or the evil one (most likely the latter), Davis does drama the best, and "Old Acquaintance" is a fine example of her work. Hopkins, who I previously have seen playing fairly harmless and airy characters in ("The Heiress") as well as endangered and misunderstood (the wrongfully accused school teacher in "These Three") really rolls up her sleeves and digs into this part with obvious relish. She is fantastic, and while you spend most of the movie hating her, you can't help but admire how well Hopkins performs the role. The supporting cast of Loder and Young are fairly solid, and Loder in particular is great as the put-upon, romantic and downtrodden husband. Part of you wants to smirk and call him a wuss and part of you wishes you could date him.The story itself is full and solidly carries itself well from the beginning of the film until the end. Coupled with good acting and a couple of great slaps courtesy of La Davis, "Old Acquaintance" was a good, meaty film that I watched with great relish, wondering where it had been for the last 20 years I have spent watching all things classic film, and in particular, Bette Davis. There was nothing stupendous about "Old Acquaintance" that made me speak in tongues or anything, but it is a wonderful film that has fallen into relative obscurity over the years that deserves to be seen and enjoyed. 8/10 --Shelly</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far superior to the 1980s remake...Davis and Hopkins are brilliant...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood was still at the height of the "women's films" with stars like Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins sharing the screen in stories with romantic notions. This one is pure soap suds, but just try to look away when these two real-life enemies share the close-ups. The two portray authors--one a sensitive, thoughtful woman (Bette Davis), the other a shrewish housewife who writes pulp fiction (Miriam Hopkins). The two share the ups and downs of a rocky relationship when the lesser writer becomes famous for her trash and loses her ignored husband (John Loder). A very young Gig Young provides some romantic interest for Davis--until she sensibly concludes that he is too young for her. At the end, the two women are left facing middle-age together and, as they sit before a roaring fireplace, toast each other to the fadeout strains of Franz Waxman's music.All of this plays like a Cosmopolitan magazine story of the '40s but is made to seem intelligent and likeable by the sheer magnetism of Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins, never better than here. Hopkins sinks her teeth into the role of a nasty bitch--and Davis is unusually even-tempered until the scene where she shakes the living daylights out of Hopkins.Forget the 1982 remake directed by George Cukor--like most remakes, it lacked the ingredients that made the original such a treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hoppy and Davis, Together Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis must have been relieved to know that once she was done filming THE OLD MAID, chances were she didn't have to work with Miriam Hopkins again. I can only imagine her expression in having to deal with Hopkins for one more movie after suggestions to re-team with pal Mary Astor didn't fall through. She must have thought it was some kind of sick joke. Or karma. Who knows. To the end of her life she stated that while she respected Hopkins as an actress and even went to say that Hopkins didn't have to take on supporting parts so quickly, she was a congenial person, but working with her was another story.It's not hard to see why: Hopkins tries insanely hard to steal every scene she's in from the moment the camera focuses on her back and she talks to Bette Davis' character over the phone in the opening scene. It's as if she were constantly aware of being under the camera lights and she needed to make sure that the viewer would see her as well. It only adds to her insecurity that her shrill performance, while very good, is not the focus of the movie -- indeed, she's off screen for a good chunk of the movie later on -- as it is Davis' character's story.Still, it makes for great watching: at every turn there is a chance for one of them to try and out-act the other. However, you wouldn't know that they couldn't stand each other here, just like in THE OLD MAID. The opening scenes are quite funny in establishing who Kit Marlowe and Millie Drake are as friends. Kit is the more understanding, the more tolerant of the two: she knows how to deal with her flighty friend and has come to see her quirks as basically that. Millie, while a drama queen who wants to give her friend the biggest reception ever, ever so slightly suggests an envy of Kit's career, but really has no malice towards her. You could tell they're really friends that have since fallen into the rut of duty.It's an outsider that begins to see the real nature of this friendship. John Loder, playing Preston Drake, is clearly unhappy in his marriage to Millie but stays by her regardless until he meets the woman he should have married in Kit. He can't see how being so diametrically opposed women they could even be in the same room together -- Millie is just too needy, too over-the-top to the more sensible Kit. However, it's said that every person has his or her complement and the two women, more sisters than friends, seem to be just that.It's when Millie begins to succeed as a romance writer -- a Danielle Steel or Nora Roberts of her time -- that the friendship starts to show signs of fraying at the seams. Millie shows her claws in hints, and Kit moves on, serving the war and doing more relevant things with her life. But for a movie that has two such stars, it's only fitting that somehow they remain together because after all... they're "friends", and this is a soap opera about longtime "friends" after all.OLD ACQUAINTANCE is a good woman's picture. It has good pacing and despite covering over twenty-odd years between the lives of these two women, it doesn't feel slow or repetitive. Interesting is the relationship that develops between Kit and Deirdre (Dolores Moran), Millie's daughter, who at times reacts to Kit as if she were her own mother and not Millie. Of note, as well, is how Davis looks in her role -- one only has to see how she'd look ten years later to see how accurate the make-up department got it. Where the movie goes into its only dramatic moment is the confrontation scene -- dragged out with takes upon takes since Hopkins was overacting, trying to make Davis' character more vicious but only succeeding in making herself look more the vicious woman caught -- and the reconciliation scene, which is highly unlikely. But in ending the movie on this note, it's a striking irony that for the second and last time both actresses who detested each other and had major demands on set gave their best performances. The result is the movie that became OLD ACQUAINTANCE.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A finely mounted soap</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just why this unusually literate, fairly intelligent and very well-acted film isn't yet available on video is a mystery. Bette Davis does a beautiful job playing writer Kit Marlowe and Miriam Hopkins, while a little overripe at times, does a fine job as her best friend and sometime nemesis, Millie Drake. The supporting cast is first-rate: Gig Young is very appealing and handsome in one of his earliest film roles, Dolores Moran is both sensitive and cheeky as Hopkin's confused daughter, and Esther Dale is splendid as Ms Marlowe's maid. The film revolves around Davis and Hopkins, their mutual friendship, jealousies via a love triangle, and their rivalry as authors: Davis is the noble, staid serious writer of quality literature, whereas Hopkins becomes wildly successful as the writer of sensational trashy love stories. The rather bland John Loder plays Millie's husband who takes a shine to Kit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ding, Ding, Ding! Let's have a fair fight, ladies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having gone head-to-head in "The Old Maid" a few years prior, Davis and Hopkins teamed up for round two in this film. It's a credit to both actresses that, despite their intense loathing for one another, they were able to convey warm and deep friendship on screen when it was called for, even embracing fondly when the touch of one probably repulsed the other. Davis plays a somewhat dowdy, earthy authoress who comes back to her hometown amid much flurry to visit her old school chum Hopkins. Davis writes critically-acclaimed, but lackluster-selling, books yet can't seem to find a man to share her life. Hopkins, on the other hand, has an affectionate husband (Loder) and is about to have a baby, but has no outlet for her own creativity. When Hopkins writes a tacky novel and it's a runaway best-seller, the dynamic between these old friends shifts and before long they are engaged in a rivalry and an unstated game of one-upmanship. The years flow by and, though Davis is still a respected writer and playwright, Hopkins has achieved extraordinary fame and success in her field. When Loder comes between the ladies and Hopkins' daughter Moran, as well, the sparks begin to fly, though never without a certain touch of humor. Davis enjoyed portraying a fairly realistic character in this go-round and came up with the notion that she would wear men's pajama tops to bed as a revealingly quirky trait. Though, as the film wears on, she is given a rather silly grey streak in her hair and becomes more mannered, it's still a well-drawn, interesting performance. Hopkins in at full tilt throughout and gives a zesty, energetic portrayal. One hopes that she was in on the joke of her heavily neurotic and over-the-top character. She provides a lot of the comic content with her exuberant bitchery. Loder gives a friendly, solid, if unspectacular performance. Young appears late in the game as Davis' younger suitor and is very handsome and effective. Moran is also mostly appealing and attractive, though she would exit the business before too long after marrying a producer. Revere shows up in a small, but amusing, role as a reporter. The story is an intriguing one, though there are a few head-scratching elements (such as how Moran has no recollection of what her father looks like when they meet after a lengthy separation.) Also, due to U.S. involvement in WWII coming about after the source play's debut, a bit of patriotic sentiment was incorporated into Davis' role to help assuage the potential fluffiness of such a piece in a time of war. In fact, the initial choice for director turned the project down because he didn't think audiences would care about "two bitches" bickering when there's a war on! Fortunately, the film was made as it's a fascinating thing to see these enemies working their craft together with Davis underplaying and Hopkins overplaying and somehow providing a tasty piece of entertainment in the process. Davis would have other nasty rivalries and issues with female stars after this such as with Susan Hayward in "Where Love Has Gone" and, infamously, Joan Crawford in "What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fully of juicy dialog and acting...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The context for this film makes it a lot more interesting to watch. Several years before this movie was made, Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins also starred in "Old Maid". During this filming, the two volatile actresses fought like dogs. It got so bad that Davis even ended up sleeping with Hopkins' husband--and they truly hated each other. In fact, the acrimony between them was far worse than the much publicized feud between Davis and Joan Crawford. How they got these two together for another film is curious, but Davis must have enjoyed it immensely, as she played a woman who was practically a saint and Hopkins was forces to play someone who is thoroughly despicable.The film begins in the 1920s. Davis is returning to her old home town after man years' absence. In the interim, she's become a well-respected author and the town is gearing up for her return. However, of all the people anticipating, the one who has put the most energy into it is Hopkins. It seems she and Davis grew up together and Hopkins has grand plans about their reunion. However, it soon becomes obvious that Hopkins really wants to be the center of attention and when others intrude on her plans, she becomes furious and behaves like a child. Davis and Hopkins are able to patch things up--mostly because Davis (like she did throughout the film) made a lot of allowances for friend. In other words, she bit her tongue and remembered how much she cared for her.During this tempestuous reunion, the very shallow Hopkins announces that she thinks it must not be that difficult to become a famous author and she's decided to become one, too! A normal friend would have been annoyed, but Davis takes this in a good-natured way. Amazingly, after a few more years, Hopkins IS a famous author. While not as well-respected as Davis, her books are smash successes. Unfortunately, while she is now rich and famous, her immaturity and selfishness have been allowed to blossom. Though in love with herself, he daughter is more like a household object and her husband can't stand her. Eventually, the husband divulges to Davis that he loves her and asks her to marry him, but Davis is too good a person and sends him packing.Over time, Davis and Hopkins remain friends. However, as throughout the entire film you wonder why! After all, Hopkins is thoughtless and self-centered. But, Davis is always her friend--helping her raise her daughter (since the husband had long since left). Hopkins' horridly selfish life gets more and more difficult for those around her and the viewer is left to wonder how much longer this will go until Davis kills her. Well, this does lead to one of the best showdowns in film--the scene between them is a true classic. However, by the end, even after this big showdown, the two are reunited as friends--a very dissatisfying ending for an otherwise perfect film.While there is a lot more to the film than this (including a subplot involving Gig Young and the grown daughter of Hopkins), but this is really not all that important--the fireworks between Hopkins and Davis are. That is THE reason to watch this film. And, despite the DVD having a short entitled "Old Acquaintance: A Classic Woman's Picture" and having commentary by a gay man throughout the commentary track, I hate when films are seen as a 'woman's film'--"Old Acquaintance" is a wonderful film regardless who watches it! This is one straight man who had a thoroughly wonderful time watching!By the way, I have read quite a bit about both actresses and can say that both had enormous egos and many around them hated them (though there were many exceptions as well). But, at least in the case of Davis, despite being a rather nasty person, she was a heck of a terrific actress. As for Hopkins, her temperamental nature appears to have led to her once-promising career to have fizzled soon after "Old Acquaintance".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hopkins + Davis = Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis really has her hands full in Vincent Sherman's 1943 gem, in which she battles it out with an "Old Acquaintance". The woman vs. woman war, so prominent in the films of the 1930s, '40s and '50s, gets some serious ammunition with this classic film. As excellent as it is, it is unfortunately not available on VHS/DVD, nor does it get the recognition bestowed upon many of Davis' other, and dare I say, lesser movies.Davis plays writer Kit Marlowe, a woman who is unable to find true happiness as she selflessly puts the needs of her childhood friend, Milly(Miriam Hopkins), ahead of her own desires. Milly, a self-absorbed, insecure - even childlike - housewife is constantly in competition with Kit. As the two woman have successes over the years, their friendship endures strains, but never totally collapses. The battle between them even extends to Milly's teenage daughter(Dolores Moran)during the later years of their lives.Davis nails the cattiness, insecurity and self-effacing humor that embodies Kit. Hopkins also succeeds as Milly. Even though Milly's self-destructive jealousies border on tedious and Hopkins almost succumbs to over-acting, Hopkins manages to pull back the reigns just in time. As good as "Old Acquaintance" is, however, there are moments that just don't ring true. For example, why wouldn't a teenage Deirdre(Moran)recognize her own father(John Loder), even if she hadn't seen him in a decade? Surely she would have seen a photo or had a faint memory. Despite that, though, this is a great classic just waiting to be restored and released. Fine writing, classic lines, smooth direction and stellar performances are what drive this film. One of Davis' finest and a shining entry into the women's genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins reunite after being together in "The Old Maid!" It sets practical but lonely Bette against flighty but happy Miriam. Bette plays Kit Marlowe..a single, successful author coming home to the small town she grew up in. She meets up again with childhood friend, Millie Drake played by Miriam Hopkins. There's always been a bit of a rivalry between the two, even though they've been friends. Millie has a daughter, a husband and love. Kit has a successful career but no one really to love in her life. Kit's visit triggers jealously in Millie, so she decides to become a successful author like Kit. She writes a steamy, sexy book and Kit helps it along with her connections. Lo and behold, the book becomes a best seller, starting Millie on a career eclipsing her old friend's career, but she loses her husband along the way when she lets success go to her head.The subplots swirl around these two women...Millie's envy of Kit and then Kit's help turns Millie into a success but she loses her husband who becomes infatuated with Kit. Preston professes his love for Kit, but she in turn tells him no because of Millie and her daughter. Kit falls in love with a younger man, but she finds herself unwilling to commit because of his age. He in turn falls in love with Millie's daughter. When Kit finally realizes what she has and wants to be with him, he admits to her how he has fallen for another woman..the daughter Kit never had..the daughter of her best friend. The threads weave in and out of these two women keeping them bound together. When Millie finds out Preston was attracted to Kit long ago, she sets this scene up which is one of the funniest I've seen from Bette Davis. Millie admits to Kit that she told her daughter Kit and Preston were having an affair. She goes off on a self-pitying tirade at Kit. Kit tries to reason with her to no avail. Finally, Kit leaves the apartment only to come right back again. She walks over to Millie and then shakes the life out of her and throws her down on the couch.After reading interviews by Ms. Davis about some of her frustration at some roles she has endured, it was a revealing look at how she wanted to shake the life out of some producers and directors. Ms. Hopkin's hair and shoulders were just shaking with it, and you have to wonder how many takes it took for this one.The end finds them there in Kit's apartment drinking champagne and watching the fire. They've shared more than just a friendship now. They're shared the loss of love but have kept their friendship intact.This is a delightful movie, and one worth watching. It reminds us how friends alway stick no matter what. No one is perfect and each have faults and good qualities. It is true "old acquaintances" can accept both good and bad and stick to the end!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chatty, entertaining and well-acted drama with comedic trimmings has lifelong friends Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins both becoming writers: Davis, the literary authoress who charms the critics but can't score a bestseller; Hopkins, the fluttery, popular novelist of romantic fiction. Director Vincent Sherman does a good job at bringing this all to a boil, and yet there's too much breathless soap opera packed into the last act (the fault of the screenwriters, working from a play) and it eventually becomes fatiguing. Still, Hopkins does a high-wire act with her performance that is quite nimble (she's pitched very high but is never grating). Davis starts off very fresh and natural, but as her character ages and becomes glamorously middle-aged, Bette's affectations and mannerisms tread a self-parody; she's good throughout the film, yet one longs for more of that earthy quality she displays in the film's first hour. A fine "woman's picture" nevertheless, with some unusually good dialogue and well-paced sequences. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Enjoyable melodrama is even more so if you are aware of the back stage tension between the stars. Having costarred with Miriam Hopkins in The Old Maid several years previously and finding it a wearing situation Bette had no desire to do so again. She really wanted to make this with Norma Shearer but Norma turned it down and retired so Miriam was in and it became an ordeal that Bette bristled about whenever asked to the end of her life. That conflict seems to have fed into the spark between the actresses on screen and gave a lot of energy to their scenes. That energy is missing from the rest of the movie whenever either lady is not on screen because the other featured players John Loder and Dolores Moran while attractive are missing that spark that makes a star and their contributions are minor. Anne Revere, glamorized for once, has an amusing scene as a reporter who respects one of the ladies as a writer and not the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Camp Treat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Old Acquaintance started as a Broadway play by John Van Druten and ran 170 performances during the 1940-41 season. It is the quintessential star vehicle and two Broadway legends, Jane Cowl and Peggy Wood played the rival women on stage. On screen the film version stars Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins and in this instance it really helped to have two women who positively loathed each other in real life. Helped enormously with their performances.The two are childhood friends and rival authors, Bette is a writer of seriously acclaimed classics that just don't sell and Miriam is the Jacqueline Susann of the pair, a writer of potboiler trash fiction that the public eats up. For reasons never explained by the film, Miriam nurses a pent up jealousy over Bette which Davis patiently bears throughout most of the film which takes place over a twenty year period in their lives. Davis rightly can't figure it out, Miriam is the one with the husband and child both of whom she smothers with her overbearing personality. The Broadway play which took place in only one setting, the Davis character's apartment was considerably expanded for the screen and I will say that the play's stage origins are barely noticeable. The play and the film are strictly vehicles for the two stars, the other players would dare not intrude even if their parts permitted. Old Acquaintance in the hands of players less capable of Davis and Hopkins would be a disaster. But with the two of them it is one camp treat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Shaking up the sisterhood of a life-long love/hate rivalry.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As powerful as Bette Davis was in Hollywood in the early 1940's, the biggest female star of her era wasn't above giving less so another performer could have more. Her subtlety in "The Great Lie" lead to Mary Astor winning an Oscar; She graciously took second fiddle to the outrageous Monty Woolley in "The Man Who Came to Dinner", and allowed Paul Lukas front burner in "Watch on the Rhine" to lead him to his own Oscar as well. For her second pairing with Miriam Hopkins, she simply reacted while Hopkins overacted, and the result was Davis stealing away the film without really trying.Like her character in "The Old Maid" (her first pairing with Hopkins), sympathy ended up being on her side, not Hopkins. At least in "The Old Maid", Hopkins allowed subtly fake charm to dominate her performance. But here, she chews the scenery with so much venom, the meat of her performance never reaches her digestive system. She makes the character of the selfish and silly housewife and mother-to-be so resentful of Davis that it seems that she actually hates every aspect of the character that Davis plays, fictional or not. Whether or not the truth of the rivalry between these two ladies off screen was true or not, Davis acts like it is non-existent, while Hopkins seems determined to upstage her co-star every chance she gets.Even when they are having meaningful heart-to-hearts, Hopkins acts entirely too grand, as if she was the diva in an opera, and the sympathy that should be there for her character (abandoned by her husband after she achieves success as a writer of trashy romantic novels) simply vanishes. After one confrontation, it is obvious that Davis's character (and perhaps Bette herself) has just had enough, quietly shuts the door, walks back to Hopkins after changing her mind about leaving, and you can hear yourself shouting, "Knock her lights out!"Hopkins, so good in her early romantic dramas, sinks to a new low here, and thus after this, was reduced to touring mostly in stock and supporting parts in films where she often bellowed her lines. The one film of her later career that somehow lacked this was a sympathetic role in "The Heiress" where she simply played the role as written. John Loder wins sympathy as Hopkins' husband who smartly walks out after simply having had enough, leaving her with barely a word. Gig Young is handsome as the younger man who proposes to Davis, all the while unknowingly in love with Hopkins and Loder's grown-up daughter (Donna Moran). If you want to see the difference between a braying performance and one with similar selfishness played with realistic acting, watch Moran's initially spoiled brat have her tantrum then slowly return to reality with a glow as she begins to see things beyond her own ego. Esther Dale gets some good moments as Davis's housekeeper, and Anne Revere has a memorable one-scene cameo as a reporter interviewing Davis. Hopkins really does well in this one scene with her reaction to Revere's embarrassment after insulting typical romantic trash novels like herself.In spite of the film's short-comings, this soap opera is fascinating to watch, and one longs to have been an extra or crew member to have witnessed what really went on. Davis makes her acting look so easy, but at times, you begin to feel sorry for everybody in the film and on the set (even Hopkins) because it seems that everybody (including her) must have had a terrible headache because of her constant ranting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anothe Bette Davis classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Film follows the friendship of two friends from 1924 to 1943. One is "Kit" Marlowe (Bette Davis) who writes serious books that never make money. The other is Mildred Drake (Miriam Hopkins) who writes pulp novels by the dozens...and makes tons of money. Also involved is Preston Dake (John Loder) Mildred's husband, her high strung daughter Deirdre (Dolores Moran) and Rudd Kendall (a ridiculously young Gig Young) who wants to marry Kit.Next to "Now Voyager" this is my favorite Bette Davis film. It's beautifully done with a good script, direction and acting. It's never dull and the passing of years is done great. Hopkins is WAY over the top here screeching most of her lines, marching across a room, arms flying, eyes wide open...but it fits her character. Davis is much more low-key and it works beautifully. The contrasts of the two characters is right on target. It's well known that the two actresses hated each other but it actually helps the movie. At one point Davis has to calmly reach out and grab Hopkons and shake her violently. It's a GREAT scene. The supporting cast is good too except for Loder. WAY too wooden in his role. Still this is a great movie well worth catching. Updated and remade in 1981 as "Rich and Famous". That's also a good movie but not as good as this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably my favorite Bette Davis Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think the reason I like this film so much is Bette Davis doesn't play "herself" in this. Not a caricature of herself I mean. She's not wicked evil. She's not over-the-top. The over-the-top part goes to Miriam Hopkins. She's just steady as she goes throughout the whole film...and that was a rarity in her career.The basic outline of this one is that Bette Davis has a lifelong friend and one year she goes and visits her back home. From there, we start to see her friend become envious/jealous and this is a catalyst for her to become and author like Davis is...but with romance novels instead. This premise leads to fights, marriage break-up and Davis basically raising her friends child. Her friends whole life is success and she equates that to money. Money makes things better. But Davis doesn't live/see life like that.The whole film you realize that Davis is just a really good person. She's very patient and just nice to everyone and genuinely cares for her friend and there family. She's what everyone should strive to be like. Basically, she's the rock of the group. I think this film really hits the nail on the head with what real friendships are like in real life. One in the bunch who's the rock and one who's over ambitious and thinks money is the most important thing. Everyone knows though...in life...money comes and goes but your friends, if you treat em right...last a lifetime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to Miss Marlowe?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Davis admitted to enjoying very much a scene in "Old Acquaintance" in which she shakes Hopkins hard.(Wikipedia).She also wrote that her co-star (with whom she also made "the old maid") felt insecure and that there was a good dose of rivalry between her and "Millie" .As the story is thoroughly the depiction of a rivalry (as writers,as lovers and even as mothers -Kit is also Deirdre's mom in her heart ),everything works out fine.The first sequences may be deceptive :Kit appears as the superstar with a fan club in her friend's home town and people are led to believe that she's got an inflated ego and that good housewife Millicent has done the right choice.But actually the desperate housewife is eaten with envy and she too wrote a book (Harlequin romance style).Time will show the wiser although the last sequence tends to show that,all in all,friendship survives everything ..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mirror mirror on the wall, who's the fairest of them all?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...asks Millie Drake (Miriam Hopkins),but the answer she gets from the mirror, from the public, from her husband, from her own daughter seems to be "You are! But we just think Kit is a better and deeper person!" Millie and Kit Marlowe (Bette Davis) have been friends from girlhood, and Kit becomes, even in her 20's, a renowned author, a critical success but not a tremendously financial one. Millie, on the other hand, already married to a successful engineer and also pregnant, decides to compete with Kit and write too. However, she pounds out trashy romance novels that are a hit with the masses and therefore make her rich but not critically acclaimed. And that's really all that Millie has wanted since childhood - to be better at Kit at SOMETHING. And yet she keeps failing because Kit's strength is not in what she has but what she is.Now Hopkins plays Millie so over the top and childish that it is hard to dislike her. She takes her husband, Preston, for granted and loses him - he grows to love Kit but she says that is a line friends simply do not cross, even if the break up of the marriage had nothing to do with their feelings. Millie spends so much time on her career that her daughter Deirdre comes to think of Kit as a mom just as much as Millie. How will this all work out? Watch and find out. I will tell you that the surprises are in the men, not in the women. Millie takes everything the way you would expect her to - throwing temper tantrums dressed in the finest fashions while Kit is the lighthouse, the rock of stability through everything. Now back to the men. For one thing Millie's ex-husband doesn't bother to see his daughter for over ten years! He wouldn't have seen her even then had it not been for Kit bringing them together. Preston is no bum, he's had a good career, but no time or place for his daughter in his life? Then there is Kit's beau during the war years who is ten years younger than her and is constantly nagging her to marry him. Their age means nothing he promises, she's all he's ever wanted ... BUT one walk with Deirdre, who is practically Kit's daughter, and he dumps his 42 year old fiancée for a 19 year old girl? Men! How did we win a world war with these weasels in charge? I've given a great deal of the plot away, but the joy is in the execution, not the details. I will give this as a sign of how much it interested me. I was getting ready to exercise and this was on Turner Classic Movies. I usually like to listen to music when I exercise, but this film so interested me - it was not your standard 40's soap opera - that I actually watched the film during my workout and then dragged out one of my Bette Davis collections to see the entire thing.Highly recommended. Just one thing. Do you think Miriam Hopkins did such a good job because maybe Millie actually WAS the real Miriam Hopkins? Just wondering.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Star vs "the star"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no contest here.....the Star, Davis runs off with the film while "the star", Hopkins rants like a drunken fishwife and makes herself look like a contestant at amateur night. I have never been a Hopkins fan and this film validates my opinion........she is shrill and over the top.The film is another of those "women's pictures" so popular in the 30s and 40s and holds up well in that genre. I won't repeat the plot as it has been covered in other reviews. Davis is looking good as the professional woman that she portrays and although she does her typical schtick with cigarettes and hand gestures, she is a little more subdued than usual. You can almost believe her affair with the boyish Gig Young and her sorrow as it ends. You, however, can never believe that the elegant John Loder could have been married to Hopkins.......he belonged with Davis but it was not to be. My favorite scene has to be when Davis shakes the snot out of Hopkins and since it has been reported that they didn't like each other, I'm sure it was Bette's favorite scene as well.If you like soap operas and sacrifice, then this film is for you. It's not as bad as it appears initially.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though Miriam Hopkins and Bette Davis were constantly feuding off-screen, they sure made one great gem of a movie in 1942-"Old Acquaintance."It's essentially a story of a haughty woman (Hopkins) who really ruined Davis's life, her best friend, for after splitting with her husband of 9 years, Davis would not go with him (John Loder) out of respect for her dear friend.The movie starts out with comic overtones with everything going wrong when Davis visits Hopkins.I could have seen Hopkins and Davis reverse their roles and the film would have been fine.If that isn't enough, imagine years later, when Davis's fiancé, Gig Young, 10 years younger than her, changes his mind about marrying Davis since he falls for Hopkins's daughter, Deidre.The film concludes with the two women apologizing to each other and basically settling down to their work and lives alone.Hopkins is bitter and abusive whereas Davis is kind and understanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If one OLD MAID is good . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . then two OLD MAIDS will be great, Warner Bros. decided in 1943. In this thematic sequel to OLD MAID (1939), Miriam Hopkins and Bette Davis reprise their roles from the earlier film, with even a JEZEBEL reference thrown into the mix. This time the functions of biological and nurturing mother are switched, as it's Hopkins popping out the daughter but Davis becoming the De Facto mom. In another new wrinkle, screenwriters decide to double the number of Great Loves in the sterile life of the Davis character, and to engineer a series of implausible circumstances to have Hopkins' family snuff out ALL of Davis' opportunities for Love Connections. No doubt this was on the direct orders of the U.S. War Department's censors, who reigned supreme over every nuance of Hollywood flicks during the early 1940s. The prospect of Bette Davis birthing baby after baby on the Big Screen was viewed by the Top Brass as a less enticing reason for G.I.'s to fight their way home than Lana Turner and Betty Grable's bare legs. Though Ms. Davis' "Kit" makes a big point of nixing P.J. bottoms here, military censors were unmoved by her Nocturnal Bare-Leggedness</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like this movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I may be rating it a bit higher than some people, perhaps because I have read about the back story in several books. Miriam Hopkins was up to tricks the whole time, trying to upstage Bette, driving Bette to distraction, so it is fun to watch to see if she gets away with any of it. There is one scene where she kneads a handkerchief almost to shreds while Bette is talking, forcing you to look at her instead. That is the kind of thing that drove Bette nuts.Bette is very un-Davis-like here, she is not twitchy, not hysterical and her speaking cadence is actually quite normal. In fact, Miriam is the one who twitches and throws jewelry and displays histrionics. I kind of wonder why Bette didn't grab the role of Millie instead, in a way. Her role at Kit is noble and intellectual, playing the "real" writer whose serious books don't sell (though she still wears furs) while Millie is the wildly successful writer of romance novels, churning them out like "sausages" as a woman from the press makes the mistake of letting slip in front of her. And of course Millie's husband falls for Kit, as Millie evolves into a vain, material obsessive. "I should have thrown myself out the window, like I planned," she shrieks, when her husband leaves her. Seconds later, she is planning her life as a newly-single woman.Bette gets the opportunity to make one of her ever-so-righteous speeches for the Red Cross in war time, complete with somber eyeglasses. She looks like Girl Scout in her trim little uniform and tri-corner hat. And when she exchanges her uniform for yet another fur and removes the hat, she flaunts a wide skunk-like streak of white in her hair, to show the passage of years.Overall an entertaining romp, if only to watch the actors. Gig Young is good too as her younger boyfriend.The ending is code-like...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic friends story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is about two childhood "friends" who want the best of life. Both Bette Davis and Miriam Hopkins are writers, but only Bette has talent. Even with critical acclaim, Bette finds it hard to make good money. While Hopkins goes the cheap sex novel way and becomes rich. Both hate one another for having something the other would love to have, Bette the money and Hopkins the talent. With the way these two go at it, you wonder why they even call each other friends. But like real friends, the love and respect they have for one another does shine through once in awhile.This is a true classic for those who like two women going at each other like pit bulls. But seriously, both Davis and Hopkins are very good in this film. Considering how each actresses were trying to upstage the other only helps make their scenes better. Gig Young(The Gay Sisters) and Doloris Moran(To Have Or Have Not) are also good. Watch it and be prepared to be entertained.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dissenting opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bette Davis gets my vote for all-time best female actress. I have many of her films on DVD...but I'm not tempted to purchase this one. But, it's not because of Bette Davis.One reason is that, in my view, the film sort of wanders. I got to thinking that if someone asked me what the film was about in ONE sentence, I couldn't tell them. It would take a paragraph...or more.But importantly, this film finally answered a question I have long had. Was Miriam Hopkins a really good actress? After watching this film a couple of times, I have come to the conclusion that the answer is NO! NO! A thousand times NO! I think she is horrible and over-the-top in this film, and frankly I have grown tired of her frequent performances as a foolish ninny. Perhaps some others agreed, since after this film she didn't make another movie for 6 long years. If you want to watch a horrid performance, perhaps this is a good reason for you to watch this film. And the famous scene where Bette Davis violently shakes her (which even Davis claims she enjoyed doing in a realistic manner)...shaking her was not enough. She should have slapped her a few times, as well.Davis' performance her is quite good. Isn't it always? This is the "good Davis" you'd probably enjoy knowing.Gig Young has a supporting role here, and it's nice to see another of his early films where he showed a flair for drama, rather than his later films where he seemed to always show up as the lead male actor's best pal. John Loder, as Hopkin's husband, is very pleasant here, and he's in a role that is very sympathetic. And, Esther Dale is wonderful, as always, playing the maid.In terms of plot, in my view it wanders. You're unlikely to be able to get a grasp of where the story is going. At first this is refreshing when you assume Mariam Hopkins book is going to be awful and she will hate Bette Davis for telling her so. Instead, Hopkins goes on to write pop books that sell, while Davis writes deeper books that don't sell, but impress the critics. And so the film takes off in a different direction than you expect, and continues to do so throughout.I enjoyed Bette Davis here, and most of the rest of the cast, but Mariam Hopkins is so awful it's entertaining...but for all the wrong reasons. Still, it's worth watching at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Old Acquaintance" Feels Old Hat</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't much like this Bette Davis women's picture from 1943.It starts out promisingly enough, with Davis as a successful writer paying a visit to childhood friend Miriam Hopkins. Always competitive, Hopkins decides she wants to be a writer too, and finds tremendous success writing popular entertainments while Davis struggles to find an audience for her more artistic endeavors. If the film had continued to examine the relationship between these two artist friends, it might have been engaging. However, it instead goes off on a bunch of standard-issue romantic tangents, all of it the stuff of dull soap opera, none of it very interesting, that feels like a hundred other movies you've seen before from the same time period.Davis gives one of her best performances up to a point, until the material abandons her. The less said about Hopkins' hysterically unfunny performance, the better.Grade: C</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film follows the relationship between Kit (Bette Davis) and Millie (Miriam Hopkins) who are both friends and authors with different styles. We span 20 or so years of their lives and their relationships with Millie's husband Preston (John Loder), Millie's daughter Deirdre (Dolores Moran) and Kit's partner Rudd (Gig Young). The film explores the avenues of career woman vs family woman.The film starts badly with the men being portrayed as comedy/ineffectual numbskulls and Miriam Hopkins's screeching voice irritating the hell out of the viewer. The film is boring - it gets better in the 2nd half but it's all still a load of tosh. Bette Davis is good, though, apart from her awful habit of saying "Dahling". You want to shout out "Oi....Davis....the word is Darling!"This is a film for women. It's not bad, it's just boring.</fullReview>

It starts fine, humor and intrigue, and you figure a standard Davis classic. But it certainly doesn't last that way and then becomes soap opera sap! And not believable. No wonder Bette supposedly didn't like Miriam Hopkins, who is way overboard from beginning to end. I gave it a 5, simply because Davis is always worth seeing all the time.</fullReview>
