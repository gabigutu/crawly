		<shortDescription>Furious &amp; fast pace movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lot of expectations from Surya for his 25th film, well this movie has all the masala to complete silver jubilee. Storyline is good, screenplay is superb, this is one of the best movies of Surya till date. He is furious in the film &amp; is expected from the director as the title itself says singam,pace of the movie is good. Anushka dazzles. Vivek is OK. Songs are catchy at times. Prakash Raj with his starry looks is amazing. The best scene of the movie is when Prakash Raj says to Surya that he can transfer Surya within minutes &amp; that is what surya wants to happen so that Prakash Raj can accept his defeat. Overall its a good 2hrs 30 min entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ideal plot for "Dabbang" sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cop-stories seem to be order of the day. One-man army. One honest cop against the corruption and the evils in the society. It started with "Pokiri", "Dabbang" stamped it and now there are cop-stories are being churned out in plenty. Just like "Dabbang", the plot is the "Ssssh" word. Its the format, presentation and punch which rules the roost and transports you into the 70's/ 80's genre of film making where creative liberties were aptly justified when the audience taste-buds for poetic justice was satiated. The plot is wrapped with good performance from the protagonist and his nemesis, death-defying action sequences and romance with the lady thrown in as relief moments.Surya:: This is the first Surya movie I have watched and must admit that he has a great screen-presence. His novel mouth-ache adds to the cop character.Anushka:: Gets a few songs to shake her body and weave a romantic track around the plot. Prakashraj:: As usual he is himself, super-confident as ever. Ensures to hog the audience attention every time he appears on the screen.Songs are good. Background score is engrossing. Action sequences as mentioned earlier has a punch, though a few places it seems to imitate Rajinikanth style. Comedy wasn't upto the mark, but passable. I watched the dubbed Telugu version namely "Yamudu" and the make-suit has been done well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Suriya's best acting movie, must watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Suriya's acting in the movie is awesome and enjoyed the movie. Good action and nice acting by all crew. Prakash Raj acting is just brilliant. Singam is the man of right deeds and whole village will stand by him in case of any threat. He replicated the same at the new place he has been sent to and hence in the hour of need, everyone was standing by him.The way he tackles Prakash is just awesome. One cop like Singam can change a lot in society. The movie shows that there are people in the system who want to do real good but are crushed by the wrong-doers is true and well known.I vote the movie 10 out of 10. Good movie to watch. I watched even Hindi version of this movie, however it is not that good compared to Tamil.I hope right people take right inspiration from it!. The movie is an entertaining mix of reality and dramatization. The movie is not just another movie to me but based on a simple but strong theme which the movie rightly justifies.I suggest all to watch the movie once, as it is worth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie deserves a "middle-finger" from Tamil audiences</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The kollywood film industry has yet again delivered a crap masala movie in the form of Singam. The most important thing regarding this movies is that it underestimates the Tamil audiences. Are Tamil audiences fools watching the same old pathetic type of masala movies?. that too from the likes of Hari and Suriya...Tamil audiences deserve a better class of movies.Story line of the movie - What a predictable sh*t.. There is no story in this movie..There is a hell lot of punch dialogue throughout this flick..Suriya looks like a mad man shouting on top of his voice which he calls it as acting.... There is not a little bit of excitement by watching this boring piece of work.Boring music - As i recall there is not a single track worth listening, so is the visuals.. Some of the songs features Anushka in which she wears skimpy outfits.. All the songs features some lame dancing and the Suriya-Anushka pair is no treat to watch.. They look like a couple of actors who lost their senses by shaking their legs shabbily and calls it as dancing..Suriya is terribly disappointing in this movie..At first it was very exciting to hear that Suriya had done a cop role which suits him very much.. But had to change my opinion after watching this junk.. The climax is a bit lengthy which spans most of the time in second half .. This is the period which makes the audiences very restless because this is the lengthiest climax with no twist or turn and every single person knows the ending, that "In the end the hero always wins".. If that is the case then what is the point in making such a mediocre movie?.. This movie is absolute trash... please avoid it because it has the same old masala story with no element of surprise..My rating is 1/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Irritating flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Story goes like this. Villain Prakash Raj goes to a village/southern town where he runs into the hero and gets thrashed there. Then Surya the hero and villain come to the city and continue their fight. The fight sequences consists of doing humanly impossible feats like high jumping 25 feet, long jumping 50 feet, dodging bullets, beating up 10 guys in one go etc. etc. which only hardcore fans can appreciate. Then there are stupid punch dialogs exchanged between hero and the villain. Objective fans who can't digest unrealistic scenes will find such sequences unintentionally funny. There is the usual drab slapstick comedy interludes by Vivek, which has nothing to do with the main story whatsoever. Dancing and singing etc make up rest of the movie. If you like to watch realistic and believable movie stay away from this. Action movies don't have to be over the top and totally unbelievable like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racy entertainer.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Surya's 25th movie "Singam" written &amp; directed by Hari is a treat for the action lovers.The movie moves at a breakneck speed even before one realizes the movie gets over leaving very little time in between for the viewers to think about the logic or lack of it.To his credit ,Hari has tried to make it as much plausible as he possibly can while maintaining the tempo of the movie right through except for maybe the songs which are only 4 ,thankfully.The flow of the screenplay is lucid &amp; vivid that makes the viewing enjoyable &amp; less strenuous. When one enters the movie hall with a preconceived notion that it may be yet another masala potboiler nothing much to look forward to , what follows is two and half hours of engaging cinema .It is time for Sun pictures to rejoice &amp; repeat their successful association with Surya after that immensely successful "Ayan" last year.Surya is charming &amp; dashing as ever though he tries hard to portray the role of the ruffian police.He is clearly uncomfortable in the areas where high decibel dialog delivery is mandated. He has improved his dancing &amp; fighting skills . The makers' hard work in masking the massive difference in height between the lead pair is appreciable on screen. Anuskha has nothing much to do but to follow in similar vein as to her performance in her previous movies like "Vettaikaran". She however sizzles in the song numbers though.Prakashraj in yet another role of a dada which he will do with ease even in the middle of his midnight sleep.Vinek does succeeds in spewing humor in couple of instances in a role which is a takeoff from that of Vadivelu in "Marudhamalai".Devisriprasad's music has nothing to note while Priyan has done a decent work as the cinematographer.Hari's career is a mixed bag with a mixture of commercially super hit movies like "Saami" , "Vel" , "Tamil" as well as duds like "Seval" , "Aaru " , "Arul"?.. "Singam " is sure to find a place in the former list.On the whole , it is a time pass movie for the commercial film lovers.Bottomline : Racy entertainer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has director Hari ran out of story lines?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say the truth, this film doesn't deserve the spoiler button. Why? Because under the name "Singam", you're gonna watch the director's own 2003 flick "Saamy" starring Vikram and Trisha, modified to an extent, as if to avoid any resemblance. So by revealing the plot, I wouldn't have made much difference. This film is supposed to be Surya Sivakumar's 25th film, so you go into the theatre expecting at least a decent movie. But what you wouldn't have expected is, as the film proceeds you'll realize more and more that it has been influenced to an alarming level by Saamy, so that during the climax you are going to know exactly what is gonna happen. Actually, despite this, the film could've kept you quite engaged but for the unnecessary song sequences which seemed determined to break the pace of the film. The director has wasted the talents of the award winning actor Prakash Raj. Anushka Shetty has almost no role in the movie except for song sequences and other scenes probably present to remind you that she is the heroine. Surya's on-screen antics (the unforgettable roaring lion appearing every time he slaps a guy, whoa!) and gravity defying action sequences makes you wonder why a comedian was ever required in the film. And the comedian Vivek's comedies are average too. Overall, sadly a run-of-the-mill 25th film for Surya. But still, as many say, actor Vijay could learn a lot from Surya about acting in masala flicks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>SINGAM hailed as commercial entertainer is nothing but a Colosseum of joke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Who ever says this movie is great ,awesome,commercial entertainer must be a fan of lead actors or else they got to be really kidding because this movie is a utter piece of crap.MY PIECE OF ADVICE- FIRST BE A FAN OF TAMIL CINEMA .Its only movies like this make us (audience) looks like fools.We are in 2010 where we have people making movies like INCEPTION,MATRIX, THE LORD OF THE RINGS,Moon(2009 British science fiction film),KATRATHU TAMIL ...But here we have people making same trash over and over again in the name of entertainment and not even attempting to do some thing even close to innovative in story,screenplay direction.And in the end of the day they say we are in the league of world cinema.Seriously, there is no way i would recommend this crap to anyone.I really wonder whether the filmmaker himself had watched the movie...regards, fan of tamil cinema</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie does not have a new story. Fights are also not new. The same village stuff. But the director has done the filming in such a way that these flaws are rarely seen. Many ppl are forgetting Surya is possibly the only actor to do both a classy (kk) and a mass (singam) cop story. This movie provides complete entertainment. One thing people should follow is that they should stop comparing mass movies. Mass entertainers follow a formula which is basically a logic-less formula. The main trump card in mass entertainers is the villain n the punch dialogues. So in short similarities are inevitable. So comparison is basically pointless. This movie is not for people who look out for art stuff in every movie. This gives you full value for your money if you like to be entertained. No unwanted sentiments. Descent punches. Prakash n Surya meetings are good.But there r few flaws. Comedy was not all that great. IN few scenes Surya was found to be shouting too much. So this movie is like going to a normal hotel and having hot tasty biriyani! You will enjoy it if u like biriyani!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surya's 25th Film - Roaring Singam</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very gud energetic and action packed movie from Surya. The film focuses on the wisdom, intelligence of bright police officers(exemplified as Surya) against cunning criminals. A touch of anti-corruption is present in this movie like most of the present movies. This film starts from Nallur(Tuticorin) and ends in Nellore(A.P). Surya(Dorai Singam) is very much energetic, serious,and audacious police inspector. The starting song is as usual a message song. Anushka(Kavya) is a homely girl in the same village, who falls in love with the daring Hero Singam because of his friendliness, good character and his courage. When small issues are going on in nallur, there comes the villain(Mayil Vahanam) Prakash Raj who is expert in kidnapping and doing all sorts of corruption in Chennai. When Surya threatens him, challenges him, and make him feel ashamed with the support of the village people, villain gets him transferred to his area to take care of him.Then how the hero and villain faces each other is the film. The climax is different from all other films. The film has a touch of the film Saamy. May be bcos of the same director. Romantic scenes are less, but the songs are very romantic. Hats off to Music Director DSP and Baba Sehgal.Kaadhal Vandhaale song ROCKS!!! Vivek's comedy scenes are not much hilarious. Altogether a great MASALA film! Special appreciation to Director Hari!</fullReview>
