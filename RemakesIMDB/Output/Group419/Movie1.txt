		<shortDescription>Singham is better than Dabangg</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a movie, there is not one single moment the movie is dragging or the story get a bit boring. The movie is very fast paste and every single moment is enjoyable to watch.Ajay Devgan and the main Villain is Top Notch...both of them does a very good job. The new girl is cute to look at, and she does do her acting OK.The only minus in the movie is the songs, there is not one single song which touch ur heart, or U feel like listening to again.For me Singham is so far the best movie of 2011, and a big thanks for everyone involved from Directing to writing to give us a Damn Good Movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Ajay Devgn , Prakash Raj, Rohit Shetty, Aave Singham, Kajal Aggarwal, Majja Satkeli, Gotya?" These are some phrases that keep rolling onto your mind as soon as you leave the theater. While you are inside the theater, movie never gives you a chance to halt for a second; it's a helluva fun ride.Say it a Masala Movie, Family Entertainer, Paisa Vasool Movie or South Indian remake, I absolutely love this movie. I saw the portrayal of Pure India, Young India and Beautiful India in this movie unlike some movies which tend to show harsh realities and stuff.Ajay Devgn ( People say Salman is a Mass Actor, But I have never seen people in PVR Cinema cheering and clapping so much in any Salman Khan movie like they did for Singham ). He is undoubtedly a Hero. And Singham is all about his heroic portrayal done brilliantly by Rohit Shetty. Prakash Raj is one of the best (apart from remakes) that we have imported from Tollywood. He is a perfect goon, the tag which I would give to Amrish Puri or Amjad Khan or Prem Chopra.Direction by Rohit Shetty is awesome! Cinematography by Dudely is breezy and spirited (thanks to brilliantly shot action sequences.Who cares even if it is larger than life!) Screenplay by Yunus Sajawal is zippy. If these aspects would not have been better, than movie would have been high on style and low on content; which I am glad is not the case with Singham.Bunch of Marathi Actors and Kajal Aggarwal are takeaways too. The later looks as sweet as candy floss. Background Score (mostly made up from its title track) is up roaring and plays a major role behind Singham's coolness.The movie is made to make you feel good. And does it? Hell yeah!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch It for Ajay Devgn &amp; Prakash Raj's Performances...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remember those films where one Hero, had the power &amp; guts to bash up a dozen of baddies. Remember those films where the Hero was able to pull off any god damn thing to get justice? I am talking about the Cinema of the 1970's &amp; 1980's. The time When Action Films ruled, when Escapisim ruled Hindi Cinema.'Singham' is old wine, in a new bottle. Directed by popular filmmaker Rohit Shetty, this action-flick/remake offers nothing new, in terms of story. But what it packs in efficiently, are the Performances by it's Screen-Hero Ajay Devgn &amp; it's Screen-Villain Prakash Raj, who hold your attention, with their impeccable performances.'Singham' is the same old-story of how the GOOD tries his best to defeat the Evil. As said, in terms of story, there is no novelty, whatsoever! But, the Screenplay offers some really interesting moments, especially in the second hour, which is quite gripping. Plus, the confrontation scenes between the Good and the Evil, are arresting &amp; effective. And even the Dialogue are clap-worthy and act as a major trump card for the enterprise.But, I would like to point out, that, the romantic-track, between the Hero &amp; Heronie, is not up-to the mark and fails to leave an impact. The Drama works, the Romance doesn't.Rohit Shetty's Direction relies mainly on Stunts, and I must day, that, the Stunts/Action-Sequences, are well-done. Cinematography by Dudley is fine. Editing is fair. Music by Ajay-Atul, is decent.Performance-Wise: National-Award-Wininng Actors Ajay Devgn &amp; Prakash Raj, play their parts impeccably. Devgn plays the Hero, superbly &amp; looks the part to the T. Raj, on the other-hand, is nearly mesmerizing as the Villain. Plus, the chemistry between the two, is something to watch. Kajal Aggarwal is fairly nice. Ashok Saraf is first-rate. Sonali Kulkarni scores. Murli Sharma leaves a mark. Sachin Khedekar, Govind Namdeo &amp; Sudhanshu Pandey lend able support.On the whole, 'Singham' is an entertainer, that doesn't disappoint, thanks to it's arresting second hour, clap-worthy scenes &amp; above all, the performances by Devgn &amp; Raj.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Singham</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's no secret I enjoy the slew of Hindi films out in the last year or so that feature tough, no nonsense cops as their lead protagonist, from Salman Khan's Chulbul Pandey in Dabangg that started the ball rolling, then Abhishek Bachchan as ACP Vishnu Kamath in Dumb Maaro Dumb, and now Ajay Devgn too getting into the act as the titular Bajirao Singham. Devgn's star has been shining quite brightly of late, with Raajneeti, Aakrosh and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai from last year that allowed him to flex his acting muscles, and here he goes completely brawny as the cop symbolizing the themes from the lion motif of courage and raw power - even the opening song and dance credits are designed around the lion's roar and paw.Director Rohit Shetty teams with his preferred leading man Devgn to bring this remake of the Tamil film Singam which had starred Suriya, though in this version it's less of a mano a mano with the main villain Jaikant Shikre, where actor Prakash Raj reprised his villainous role as the chief gangster operating in Goa, whose links with politicians and the upper ranks of the police make him untouchable, so much so that he's responsible for the suicide of an honest officer whom he framed as he was getting too close for comfort in arresting him.It's interesting to look at the narrative as how a lion got taken out of its den and put into unfamiliar surroundings, forcing it at times into a corner. But like all wild animals, this may result in the animal biting back with increased ferocity. Similar to Chulbul Pandey, Bajirao Singham is a small village cop who represents the law in his hometown through a combination of strength, wisdom and plenty of slow-motion swagger, preferring community policing, and solving the community's problems without smacking down the penal code on offenders. This of course elevates his standing in the village, which comes in useful when he has to summon the big time gangster Jaikant to the station for a conditional bail release.In what he thought was a promotion for a job well done, Singham gets transferred to the city of Goa, before Jaikant lets loose that it's engineered through the greasing of palms, and now with Singham in Jaikant's town and reach, life becomes a living hell naturally. This toss up between hero and villain forms the bulk of the second half of the film in what would be a simple, straightforward story, made a lot enjoyable through its sheer entertainment value, with really deliberate, over the top action sequences that you'd chuckle at - you know, how one slap can leave a man flying through the air, or how there are many physics-defying moves that would make all would-be villains give up their life of crime when this long arm of the law reaches them. One of the more audacious stunts involves a car flipping through the air while our hero reaches in through the car window and yanking the driver out with one hand, before the car smashes through the ground. Take that, Hollywood!But all work and no play makes Singham a dull boy as well. In a typical Masala offering, Singham has its fair share of moments away from the pursuit of hoodlums, or goons as the subtitles would have it, for precious romance with Kavya Bhosle (Kajal Aggarwal) and family time both his and hers, and romantic song and dance interludes that are inevitable. Check out the title tune though which is quite reminiscent of Dabangg's exalting song of fearlessness.It's not all plain action oriented, as I would think some may find it controversial in Singham's unorthodox methods of fighting fire with fire when he discovers the rot in society is something quite beyond one man's ability to combat. I suppose tough cop stories will not go out of fashion from the Indian film industry anytime soon, for its tales of fighting against corruption in all strata and levels of society serving as an outlet in fantasy that can be eradicated completely with the enlistment of help from those who choose to stand up and be counted upon to do the right thing. This becomes that over-arching reminder in the film, despite Singham having to involve questionable methods (which can be easily classified as police brutality in certain countries) as well with the number of belt-whipping scenes, though in all earnestness, politicians such as the ones featured do deserve nothing more than a good smack on the buttocks.Still, his is a film after all, which allows for our fantasies at having those evil at heart receive their just desserts swiftly and painfully, without too much fuss in going through a system corrupted by the rich and powerful. Singham firmly sets itself as one of my favourites of the year, and it's wishful thinking on my part if Ajay Devgn and Salman Khan can share the screen together once again after London Dreams, to feature two tough police characters in one crossover film. Now that would be a double dose of hard hitting action and no nonsense police action adventure, and villains everywhere better beware! Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singham is an entertaining masala flick,a tribute to the 80's era of bollywood masala movies,an addition to the list of Hindi remakes of south blockbusters.I haven't seen the Tamil version,so a comparison is impossible.The film is full of energy,charisma and is sure to get mass applause from the people who love the true Indian flavored cinema,full of colors and raw fight between a honest,loved-by-all hero and the baddie.Seeing these kind of films,i wonder whether the age of pure entertainers is back,after films like Wanted,dabangg and ready have become blockbusters.No doubt,Singham is a sure shot blockbuster,at least in single screens.Director Rohit Shetty,after making some hilarious comedies have gone back to his base and have created an Action packed entertainer(Rohit shetty stared off with Action thriller,Zameen also starring Ajay) which is full of mass appeal.Performances::Ajay Devgn is full of energy and does 100 % justice to his cop uniform.A bunch of Marathi actors,especially Ashok Saraf deserves a big thumbs up for their excellent performances.kajal Agarwal doesn't get needed opportunities to showcase her talent,but makes her presence felt among the audience.Prakash raj is as always at his best .Some +ves::The bench of Marathi actors who does a brilliant job and the Ajay Charisma,Entertaining direction by Rohit shetty,Thrilling Background music,Editing work by Steven.H.Bernard,The raw,desi flavor of the movie.Some -ves::A familiar plot is again used,Very weak love base,The Marathi accent of Ajay,which seems artificial at times.Music by Ajay and Atul Gogavale,noted Marathi music director duo is hummable and melodious.It can be given a 7/10.Verdict::Singham is an action-packed masala movie,a reminder of the 80's era.It is full of unadulterated raw desi flavor and is sure to entertain the masses.Go for it,if you love masala entertainers.Ma Rating::8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you think of a bollywood action flick , you expect a fair amount of dramatic rush going down your spine. But unlike other action movies, Singham is indeed a different film because it's main focus is it's action which packs nothing in excess.After the huge success of action films like dabanng and wanted, Singham also was aimed at full-blown action fun with some decent and convincing fighting sequences. The storyline features Bajirao singham (Ajay devgan) an honest police cop, a good friend and a dark cloud for the wrong doers. when away from his village he is transferred to the city, he walks into an face to face battle with the criminal and his empire. Aprt from the story Ajay devgan is a treat to watch because he has forever been a part of action genre for the cop movies like wanted, dabanng and his very own gangaajal. Also the film did well because of it's great supporting cast and performances.But apart from the engrossing action fun the film lacks humor. Also the idea is not innovative and is kinda old-fashioned. But the plot is interesting enough to grab your attention quickly and pretty early. Ajay Devgan's girlfriend (Kajal aggarwal) did well on part of her acting but was offered little scope to leave a mark of minds of audience. To be honest the movie offers nothing original but is interestingly crisp and fresh stuff for the movie goers. Overall, an entertaining film for the action lovers and if you want a dose of it then Singham is the one for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singham is how it should have been...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mann bhanvar uthe, tan sihar uthe, jab khabar uthe ki aave... Singham!! The line from the title song aptly depicts what Singham is in the movie. The movie is not just another movie to me but based on a simple but strong theme which the movie rightly justifies.Singham is not just the name of the movie, but the idea that is replicated in depiction, dialogues, songs and action... i.e. everywhere.Singham (Ajay Devgan) lives in his own happy and non-corrupt world which is disturbed by the villain of the movie. And the story is how he deals with it. Though, it seems more about clash of egos than the clash of ideologies; however, the message is positive.One thing I liked the most in the movie is the power of unity and leadership that is shown. Singham is the man of right deeds and whole village will stand by him in case of any threat. He replicated the same at the new place he has been sent to and hence in the hour of need, everyone was standing by him.The message that there are people in the system who want to do real good but are crushed by the wrong-doers is true and well known. The movie is an entertaining mix of reality and dramatization.I hope right people take right inspiration from it! :) :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though not great but still has some timely roars of a LION and a likable climax.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With SINGHAM sons of two famous action masters of Bollywood return to their original genre in style. Veeru Devgun (Ajay's father) and Shetty (Rohit's father) were known for their own class in the Industry few decades before and now their proud sons return to the same genre, with which they had started. But sadly the attempt remains a visibly polished product only having few weak associations in the narrative which don't really give you a DABANGIAN kind of entertainment on the whole. Still it cannot be called a bad film for sure because it does have some great moments to offer and a winner climax which scores a clear six at the end, acting as its big savior. It's an Official remake of Tamil Hit Movie SINGAM and is all about an honest cop fighting against a mafia don and his empire based on strong political connections. Being a remake it has got all the ingredients of a typical south masala film which are just there to add some extra flavors into the film and nothing else. For instance, there is a love affair track going along with the Cop's fight which has no value of its own in the script, as usual there is a deliberately created comedy track around the pet name of a character which successfully generates some laughs in the start but later on becomes annoying. And as seen before, there exists the same eccentric kind of villain working against the Cop, whose dialogues become comical towards the end, played once again by the one &amp; only Prakash Raj. The film starts off well with an impressive sequence revolving around the expressive eyes of a small child. But post that for about 1 long hour, it offers nothing as per the expectations raised, until the scene where Ajay and Prakash meet for the first time. The LION actually starts roaring at this very moment and then keeps roaring post interval till the climax in gaps. Hence the first half is not that effective as compared to the second one since it keeps focusing on various other subplots in the script, which do not register at all. The romance track falls flat and so does the family comedy angle forced into the proceedings to provide some relief moments. Though SINGHAM scores high in its technical department such as Cinematography and Action, but it fails completely in its soundtrack. Ajay-Atul's music works just as a filler with nothing worth listening. And its really annoying to hear another title song inspired from the cult Vishal Bhardwaj's track "Omkara", sung by Sukhwinder. Moreover the Background Score is both effective as well as noisy at times with excess of loud arrangements in all those slow motion sequences. Apart from Ajay Devgan and Prakash Raj, only Sudhanshu Pandey and Sonali Kulkarni are able to make an impact on the viewer and rest all work under the shadow of its two main giants. The debutant Kaajal looks fresh and bubbly but in absence of anything special written for her, she is not able to prove her talent in any of her scenes. Ajay Devgan once again proves his versatility, returning to the action genre after a string of comical hits. His body language, specifically his eyes seem to be just perfect for such roles and he comes up like a winner all through the film. Prakash Raj though is splendid in his typical negative role but this time it looked like repetitive to me towards the climax. Yet he is immensely watchable with Ajay on the screen. In short the film completely belongs to Ajay and Prakash Raj who generate such kind of mighty impact in their scenes together that the single screen theaters are bound to go full of whistles, claps and thundering applause.In fact, the main reason behind the probable success of this film has to be these particular scenes (including the one with the Neta Ji) where Ajay answers his powerful enemies with fiery dialogues and strong punches along with its worth watching action sequences which have been shot with élan. However, at times the action also seems to be too unbelievable with some impossible kind of stunts. In the writing department, I particularly liked the thought of the National Emblem being given to the cops to wear it in their caps but not to the Country's top political leaders to use it in their dresses. Plus the icing on the cake, for all the viewers loving such kind of over the top, masala cinema, should be its well written climax which really needs to be applauded for its thoughtful idea and brilliant execution. So, overall SINGHAM does have its merits in the form of some worth watching confrontation sequences and superb action. But if you are looking for something fresh or novel then you are sure going to be disappointed with its routine kind of content. The film is not consistent enough in its narration as the real action starts after almost 45 minutes into the movie and it also becomes a bit repetitive towards the end. Yet, for all Ajay Devgan's fans its festival time in the theaters. However the last half an hour of the film forced me to think about its original makers of the South.To be specific, it struck me that if South Films are able to think of such great climax and other similar interesting plots in their own movies which in turn inspire Bollywood to make their remakes, then certainly the SOUTH CINEMA is miles ahead of Hindi CINEMA in film-making. May be the Hindi Film Industry is enjoying more success due to their over-popular stars and glamour but if studied in real sense then South Cinema is undoubtedly more important, experimental and bold which needs to be recognized at the earliest as an essential part of Indian CINEMA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Roaring Entertainer!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The acute problem of limited powers with law and order enforcers has been exposed several times in our films but seldom has it been really effective. Amitabh Bachchan's sincerity in 'Khakee', Sanjay Dutt's battle in 'Kurukshetra' Salman's 'Dabangg' and Abhishek's 'Dumb Maaro Dumb' are among those who defied norms and confronted all adversaries by themselves. Drawing inspiration from 2010's super-hit Tamil film starring Surya, 'Golmaal' series director Rohit Shetty embraces the high-flying, ridiculous action that defines his absurdity but renders a thrilling, gripping tale of injustice and abuse of power that ensues in the Goan town. One determined Police Officer, reminiscent of the angry young man of the 70's will turn the tables of power around while being righteous and astute. Bajirao Singham is Ajay Devgan's most powerful character yet and this lion hearted Officer's battle is among the most thrilling action films in recent times. Incredulous as it may seem, the credit goes to Rohit Shetty.A sincere Police Officer who was wrongly framed in corruption charges, relinquishes his career, family and life in frustration that is caused by the system's infallible ability to bend to power. The widow seeks justice in the midst of greed, power and indifference until a new Inspector arrives in town..... Heralding from a quaint Maratha village, the local hero enforces law and order through his unique leadership that involves participation. To his roar, the entire village will rise in uproar leaving the Goan goon Jaykant Shikre (Prakash Raj) humiliated when he tries to threaten Singham in his own backyard. As power unmasks its nefarious side, Singham gets transferred to Goa and from here on, the lion walks into the hunting grounds.....Singham's fast-paced narrative essentially grips you throughout, engaging you into the battle against the malicious gangster while some occasional relief, though in form of a mere distraction, is posed by Kaavya (Kaajal Agarwal ? Telugu super duper star). Among the supporting cast, the talented veteran actor Ashok Saraf leaves a heart warming impression as the retiring constable whose belief in the system is only rekindled with the advent of Singham. Sonali Kulkarni lends some seriousness to her tragedy that goes beyond just tears while Sachin Khedekar provides the comic relief that's quite unexpected from him.Prakash Raj gets to revisit the character he played just last year but his dialogue delivery is flawless and so is his zeal for acting that comes naturally as though he is Jaykant Shikre.... If there was any actor today who could play an angry young man and with his tone, countenance and threatening presence, make the box-office catch fire, it would be Ajay Devgan. In his portrayal as Bajirao Singham, he literally brings his strengths to the table while leaving out his weakness, that is comedy. As he adorns a tight fitting uniform that serves as his super-hero costume, he gains the ability to send cars and people flying through the air in so incredulous a manner that is now a trademark of Rohit Shetty's films. But apart from the ridiculous action sequences, Singham's roar is a powerful one. The plot is yet another good cop v/s corrupt system battle but Singham's approach, his solutions to harassment, his determined stance on principles and his composed rage are the elements that make this film, a laudable entertainer. Also, when compared with Shetty's prior ventures, this isn't such a mindless film. The banality of the plot is overcome by a screenplay that grips the viewer as it races through Singham's transfer from village to city. What is even more fun to watch is how, against all adversity, Singham's determination roars on screen and outwits, out-punches and outdoes Shikre's each move. Marathi artists Ajay-Atul have one outstanding track in a mediocre album. The title song with Sukhwinder Singh's superb rendition and the Singham chant that evokes the intensity in the film's important scenes are worth the entire album itself. Perhaps it is Singham that will partially erase the memory of Rohit Shetty's deplorable works in the past. Apart from bits of 'Golmaal 3', he had nothing on his resume but now, a blockbuster from Chennai has changed all that. Shetty is now the man behind Ajay Devgan's and 2011's biggest hit in the making. For an action film about an angry young Cop, Singham scores with his roars....8.42 on a scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay I cannot believe I ignored watching this movie for this long. I guess the name "Singham" threw me off as it sounded like a low-budgeted political kind of movie.A little did I know it was a Rohit Shetty's movie, as I always see him as comedy director. So I decided to go ahead and watch it. And I can honestly say from beginning till the end, this movie kept me on the edge of my seat. Fantastic acting my Ajay Devgan. Indian residents are complete idiots for liking "Chulbul Pandey" so much, Salman's acting was not even close to Ajay's role in this movie.Action was great, casting was great. Prakash Raj has now become my favorite villain of all time. He was damn good in Wanted and I had hoped to see him again and thankfully he was in Bbuddah Hoga Terra Baap. But I had no idea I will see him again in this movie, I absolutely loved his acting. So far my favorite villains has been: Amrish Puri, Ashutosh Rana, Rahul Dev, and now it's Prakash Raj. I really hope to see him more and more.I really hoped Rohit Shetty would've given this movie a different title to attract more audiences because this movie was 10x better than Wanted, and 20x better than Dabaang.Well Done Rohit Shetty and Team!!!!</fullReview>

Kajal Agarwal was a perfect pick for this role.For moviegoers who does not know the Indian productions this is a must see, as it will serve as a sample of what is considered a good production on India. It is a different country, a different culture, and of course, the movie industry has got different models and standards.In spite of being quite long (~2h20) is worth seeing. And I would recommend you to watch it in a group of friends. You will laugh a lot and on some scenes you will certainly have an urge to talk immediately about it with someone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singham is an enjoyable film that can best be described as a popcorn + movie. The film stars Ajay Devgan as Singham, the head of a local Police station, whose character is like a cross between Judge Dredd and a Holy priest. So one minute he'll be pistol whipping a goon-doh, and the next minute he'll be serving up coffee to some lepers in Gujarat.The story portrays the bureaucracy inherent in the Police and also the Indian Government which allows corruption to exist and proliferate. Prakash Raj plays baddie Jaykant Shikre who wants to own the whole of India. He puts in a great performance equal and opposite to Devgan's Singham.Devgan, as Singham, looks like a well tanned but middle aged Mitchell Johnson. When Mitch is not sledging, he's out with his honey (Kajal Agarwal) who looks like the typical girl next door for 14 year old boys. Therefore Devgan and Agarwal look curiously mismatched when together on screen. Agarwal's performance was good considering her part was like a little snack compared to the feast devoured by the other two, and also that she had to pretend to love her Kaka Gee. Maybe the reason for the Johnson style tache is to hide Singham's false teeth?I'm sure most people can identify with the scenarios in the film particularly when dealing with the outlaws that surface in everyday life. The premise of the story is excellent, but it is inevitably compromised in places to provide the film's obligatory happy ending. Nevertheless it's a light and enjoyable ride!Pros - Great action, story, lead and support rolesCons - Take it (or leave it) fighting and dancing scenesOverall - The ancient, long forgotten and mysterious Police Academy training bible</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For any person who loves a nice action movie, then you should watch Singham. Follow the non-stop action from the village to the city of Goa as Ajay Devgn delivers a monstrous performance against Prakash Raj. Well directed, with a good, easy to follow story line, Singham provides an all- in-one family entertainment.One striking element in this film is how good the action sequences have been filmed. Prakash Raj is a great actor. See how effortlessly he takes his lines and how easy it is to laugh at his conversations.Well, the music isn't so great but still, blends well with the story and the rest of the film. Great film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looked entertaining but lacked the proper punch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Singham is what I'd describe as a throwback to the 80's mindless action movies where the hero alone takes only gangs of thugs and beats them to a pulp without ruining his hairstyle. In this case, Singham's moustache! Singham is shot in the same style as Dabangg, except that Singham's storyline was meant to have more in terms of depth and seriousness of the storyline. Instead it becomes a caricature of itself and manages to spoil what would have been good entertaining movie.The good thing about Dabangg is that no one really takes themselves seriously in the movie. Salman, after all these years, still cannot act properly and continues to pass himself off as some Hollywood super cool action star. But at least his cheesy style worked in the movie because the storyline was tailor made for that cheesiness. But in Singham it's the opposite.Ajay Devgan takes himself too seriously in the role and thus it's frustrating to watch him take out whole groups of people and then earnestly tell off a whole police squadron for their lack of honor and duty. How can you take Singham seriously when he chases down a car on foot or rips a steel pole out of solid concrete.This should have been a much better movie, concentrating more on the police corruption than on the ridiculous action stunts.Acting wise Devgan is okay. His seriousness in the silly role spoils, for me, the movie. In fact the only person who stole the show was Prakash Raj as Jaykant Shikre. It seems that he was the one actor who realized what a pathetic story Singham was and so he might as well have fun. He provided quite a few laughs with his antics, and I even admired his guts whenever he was outnumbered by the good guys. Kajal Agarwal as Kavya was okay, and better than most new débutantes. She certainly has more screen time than Sonakshi Sinha in Dabangg.Having seen the rubbish that Rohit Shetty had directed prior to Singham I shouldn't be surprised with Singham but sooner or later Shetty will have to make a decision: Either make good sensible movies or stupid comedies that can cause brain damage. Personally, I hope he chooses my preferable choice: stop directing.This is hard to recommend. I'd say watch Dabangg instead for something more hilarious and fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>a very good film indeed one of the best films i've seen....ajay s a very fine actor who is very underrated, he's in the league such as Salman and Hrithik...there was this film called apaharan, his performance in this film is unforgettable, while watching him in this film you realised how talented he really is....when you think of Ajay, the first thing that comes in your head is that he is an intense actor, followed by that he can fight on screen well, then you seem to think that he has a brilliant comic timing....indeed he has a very good comic timing such as in all the best where he was as good as Fardeen....he is a good romantic actor as well, lie in Dil Kya Kare, Pyaar To Hona Hi Tha, Raju Chacha, Diljale,etc....there was one incident where people were saying that Shahrukh should have married Kajol instead of Kajol marrying Ajay...well i think that Ajay and Kajol make a perfect couple on screen a well in real life more than Shahrukh and Kajol, no wonder Shahrukh and Kajol don't seem to act together on screen as much now..Ajay was brilliant in this filmi think he was perfect for the role as the copthis film is a must watchrating: 8.5/10</fullReview>

N now, a little bit about the lead actress, Kajal Aggarwal, no ravishing beauty but strangely very attractive (almost reminds one of Tanushree Dutta, strictly on looks of course) reasonably good debut..but wrong choice of movie for a debut...as in SINGHAM is ALL, n i really mean ALL, about Bajirao Singham (dats the character Mr.Devgan plays)....:P BOTTOMLINE - Barring a couple of bloopers (such as killing someone with a 9mm Beretta, and planting a S&amp;W .38 at the crime scene)IF you're looking for your money's worth...then go for it...its gritty, has a kind of mass appeal, has good dialogs (spoken most enthusiastically by Mr. Devgan) but most importantly...there's never an idle moment...THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE MOVIE....(hope u don't expect expletives / scanty attires to be within scope of 'ur money's worth', cos SINGHAM is selectively devoid of both)...!</fullReview>

Many action scenes look like from global movie especially the car flying (that's seems to be repeating more then often ). Movie song you wont remember and are boring beyond the time music. The only Pisa weasel scene in the movie is the scene where Devan insist on bringing the politician to police station for attendance and ruthlessly beat his followers and whole village comes in his support ? this 10 min scene is the real Pisa weasel.kudos to director and actors</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Singham ? Bollywood masala that will taste good if you have a taste for it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though, a bit late in writing the review for Singham but it's not that bad if you do a right thing a bit late, but you do it. So here, I go? Bajirao Singham played by Ajay Devgan is a police inspector in a small village on the Goa Maharashtra border which accidentally is his own village where he has grown with people and lived his life. He is a tough cookie with large biceps, robust mustache and strong voice. But at the same time, he is nice, humble, emotional, and romantic and loves his people, country and job. All in all, Singham is an idealist cop and a perfect human being. Jaykant Shirke played by Prakash Raj is a goon cum politician who is the king of Goa and has power, police and money to influence things and even makes an honest police office to commit suicide leaving the wife of the police officer fight for justice through out the movie . The movie set in the backdrop of rural Maharashtra and Goa with many popular Marathi one liner used in the movie revolves around just these 2 main characters- Singham and Jaykant Shirke, and rest all of them are only supporting cast. Though Kajal Agarwal as the leading lady of the film looks good and acts reasonably well too. Rohit Shetty, after his series of Golmaal comes out with a cat out of bag by bringing in action movie, but that doesn't mean he is going to compromise on his dialog style and the car blowing scenes. These are copyrights for Rohit shetty and not restricted to Golmaal. The ill fate of Prakash Raj brings him in contact with Ajay Devgan and this starts the series of bull fight between the hero and the villain. What makes it exciting is that they both get chances to win over each other though the end as usual is won by the hero of the movie. The verbal volleys, fight scenes between the two makes the movie exciting and doesn't let you move away from the movie.The weak point of the movie are the songs which are not good enough to make you hear it and also extends the movie length by few meters. Also, the climax is a bit extended as the director tries to bring in some comedy into the climax scene which makes the movie spicy but it's a bit long. Overall, I liked the movie more because of excellent acting by the Villain Prakash Raj and Ajay Devgan and yes the dialogs are good though some time senseless by literary terms. So, if you love bollywood masala flavored by some really good acting then go and watch Singham and you will like it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satirical Entertainer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Packing a powerful message with electric dialogs and hard punches. Singham surely is a thought provoking movie that glorifies the protagonist who adopts and adapts to the existing system and by his sheer virtues and belief inspires the rest to stand up for what they believe but lack the courage to accept. Exaggerated action sequences that are meticulously designed and craft fully laid out will surely enthrall and amuse the masses. Its an entertainer and worth the penny.You do get to carry a message if you are looking for one. All in all a must watch for all those who are looking forward to a weekend mas ala movie. The director has sure done his groundwork well, Ajay is good as usual, Miss Agarwal has made a promising and charming start here in Bollywood. However, the real credit goes to Prakash Raj for his fabulous performance, understanding of the character and charismatic execution that simply sweeps you off. Singham surely does roar and the corrupt system is definitely more hostile than the real jungle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An assault on the senses</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only reason for the 2 rating (as opposed to a 1) is because of the money shot :) the devgan eight-pack rising from the water in majestic slow-mo. Which actually gave rise to a question that would vex me over the next 2.5 hours viz. how is that lungi remaining draped around the devgan pelvic girdle? Its a good thing that the money shot got over in the first five minutes, because the rest of the movie is devoted to a cacophony of sight and sound that relentlessly assaults the senses...the only mercy coming in the form of an intermission (too short), and the random slo-mo shots (too slow). The movie substitutes sight for sense, and sound for dialogue - and it is such a shame to see to veteran Marathi actors such as Sachin Khedekar, Ashok Saraf and a few others (my bad, I do not know their names) prance around Devgan's Singham.So let's talk about the eponymous character - Bajirao Singham. An honest, upright officer, given to destroying public property and engaging in gymnastic fisticuffs, he is played by Ajay Devgan. As a occasional break from the dishoom-dishoom, he also plays simpering lover to an even more simpering Kavya. In both roles, he is completely over the top, but at least one can say that he matches the overall tone of the movie - loud, over the top and colorful. And that is NOT a compliment...really it isn't.Its very hard to believe that this is the same Devgan of Omkara and Company and Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai, and even Bhoot. wasn't he the master of understated acting? I remember his eyes talking volumes in Omkara...here he lets his over-sized biceps and his over-tight trousers do ALL of the talking. Unfortunately, there's a limit to how much they can talk. The rest is a yawning gap where a movie should have been.If I am not talking about the rest of the characters, it is because there aren't any...they are just caricatures. Not even the villain (played by Prakash Raj) makes a mark. Its Devgan, Devgan, Devgan all the way.</fullReview>

You'll have a hearty laugh throughout.All the characters seems to be hand picked for their respective role. They have all done a fantastic job. Prakash Raj is hilarious but has his hangover from Wanted. The character Gotaya will leave you in splits.The background score is OK but adds its punch whenever required. The action is Rajnikanth style defying all logic but thats the charm of the movie.The songs in between do break the rhythm of the movie but it ends quickly. Watch it with a group who can whistle and you will enjoy yourself thoroughly.I liked Kajal Agarwal from her Telugu hit Maghdeera. Doesn't add much to the movie but its not irritating either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Movie: Singham Rating: 4.5/5Rohit Shetty is an action packed director often known to make action packed movies. Same with Singham, a remake of Tamil Super Hit Singam, which starred Suriya in the lead role. That movie was fantastic. But as its Rohit Shetty as the director and Ajay Devgn as the hero, they have made it even more entertaining. The film is not a scene by scene copy, but it sounds a different film in various scenes.Ajay Devgn, to be very honest, has come out with his best performance in this film. Although the role of Singham may have been done by other action heroes, but this role suits him the best. The action scenes are one of the best. The music is good and the rest other actors find it easy to make their presence felt. Since its a Rohit Shetty movie, it has lots of car and jeep blasts, which should not be missed at all. The story is brilliant and the movie- entertaining!On the whole, Singham is a great mass entertainer, that has lots of elements which make it work. Watch it, you won't be able to find any flaws, believe me!</fullReview>

It's weird as generally it happens vice versa with Indian movies. Again, as you pretty much guess there are corrupted politicians as always. I wonder when will Bollywood make a movie about some decent politicians anyway.If you look for entertainment, Singham is 100% a good choice as it never fails to give you fun. However, if you are looking for a reality movie pass this one as you will see, throughout the movie, flying cars, men, all in the air.</fullReview>

I'm sorry to those that enjoyed it, but for a serious action film, this over-the-top action has to stop, Dabangg did it, and it was just as bad. If this was a comedy film with a comedy plot and script that's fine with me, the action is fine, but when you have a serious action film plot, you have to ensure that the action is realistic, or you film will sink to the bottom, which is what this film did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't aware that Rohit Shetty directed 'Singham'. Otherwise I would have avoided this. The only reason why I decided to watch this was because I had scene it in a top ten best film list (where it was listed alongside gems like 'I Am', 'Stanley ka Dabba' and son) and read that it was a homage to those B-movie-type films. Anyway, after watching it I'm still wondering where the homage was? It's pretty much just another remake of those horrible 90's action flicks. The only difference is that it's a tad more 'stylized'. I mean the dishum dishum action sequences (yes, there are plenty of those) are a combination of slow-motion and fast-forward. The story has nothing new to offer. It's the typical one man versus numerous goons. Ajay Devgan has had more than a decade's practise of playing the 'good cop' so he plays it to the formula. However, the scene stealer is Prakash Raj. With his natural flair for comedy, he is hilarious as the over-the-top villain. Anyway, there isn't much else to say really. 'Singham' disappoints but Prakash Raj tickles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent but pales front of Tamil SINGHAM</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SINGHAM as people know was first made in Tamil starring the heartthrob Surya and Anushka Shetty with Prakash Raj as the villain After it's success the film was remade in Telugu and Kannada as Yamuda and Kempegowda respectivelyRohit Shetty who started off with ZAMEEN an action film and followed with all comedies except one Sunday which was a bad thriller cum comedy Now he returns with SINGHAM an action film.Ajay Devgn got a new lease with OUATIM last year followed by another action film AAKROSH which failed now he returns with SINGHAMSINGHAM follows the same plot as the original afterall a remake but Rohit Shetty doesn't leave his comedy part and rewrites several scenes, characters and adds lot of comedy and cuts off several other stuff from the originalThe original had several more twists and turns towards the end which is all re-written in the remake The film starts off with a new subplot of Sudhanshu-Shonali which wasn't in the original and the initial portions have been re-written too The introduction of Surya was in an action scene but here Ajay comes out bare body from a sea followed by a song, to give him credit he must be lauded as the water it seems was chilling and it requires guts to do it but from the script point of view, his introduction could be better without the DABAANG style song, we shouldn't compare it to DABAANG though The film moves on a nice pace and one anticipates a good build-up, thankfully in the remake they have avoided the long comedy track by Vivek in the original which wouldn't suit in Hindi The film however has the typical romantic/songs.etc which were in the original too and similarly the theatre scene and the fight is straight a rip-off from the original. One sore point in the remake is every time we have Ajay walk in slow motion and the music beats to the title song which was not like that in the original which makes it boring and repetitive.Keeping into mind, Rohit Shetty's comedy style, we have Anant Jog a politician unlike in the original where his character supported Singham here he is a bad guy and he keeps mouthing NONSANSE(nonsense) and also Prakash Raj's character is made funny and is given several funny dialogues unlike in the original Even the film is set in Maharashtra/Goa and they have used Marathi a lot, there are several well written dialogues but Ajay and Prakash Raj don't speak Marathi too well(Ajay is Punjabi and Prakash a tamilian) To give Rohit credit, several scenes are well handled like the clash between Ajay/Prakash Raj which mostly is recreated though the election subplot and scenes towards the end are re-written hereIn the original, Singham was promoted to ACP and also given to handle kidnapping racket which is all changed here To be fair the film keeps up to masala diktats and the film has several clap trap scenes and also good dialogues mostly copy paste but yet there leave a mark But towards the end after Ajay waking up the police and reminding them of their duties, the film changes track and ends as a farce, the climax is a big letdown and falls flat Direction by Rohit Shetty is good in parts but he fails in some scenes too and how one wishes could've stuck to the original at least towards the finale Music by Ajay-Atul also isn't that good, the title song with bad choreography by Ganesh Acharya is decent, the romantic songs are good but make the film boring Dialogues are clapworthy Action scenes are like South films, and like the original here too they defy gravity but some are too overdone like Ajay pulling the goon from a revolving jeepAmongst actors Ajay Devgan returns to masala fare and does a great job as usual in cop roles, He uses his eyes and body language to the fullest here too Thankfully he doesn't copy Surya and does well, he has worked hard on his physique too and it looks fab Kaajal Agarwal is good too in a less demanding role, She looks good and resembles Tanushree Dutta but lends some freshness Prakash Raj is superb, though getting typecast in such roles In the original his role was very serious here he is made to play to the gallery and every dialogue, expression leaves a mark He does a superb job in scenes pitted front to Ajay Devgan and their chemistry is to be seen to watch Amongst rest Shonali Kulkarni does well in her role which wasn't in the original, Sudhanshu in a guest role does well Marathi actors like Ashok Samarth and Ashok Saraf are superb, Samarth is excellent while Ashok will win his fans again after disappearance for some time, he excels towards the second half and leaves you in splits Anant Jog leaves a mark, Murli Sharma is adequate Govind Namdeo has less scope, Sachin Khedekar's comedy track wasn't in the original and his character was serious and it isn't that good here rest are okay</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The bad guy (Prakash Raj blurting Marathi phrases) uses his power for bad deeds. The distressed people have no one to look up to. Just when the whole situation seems totally helpless, the hero (a frowning Ajay Devgn) finishes his bath at sunrise and rises from the water. Apparently no one else could attempt such an Herculean task and so the entire village breaks into festive songs on his return.The eponymous hero happens to be a policeman-cum-judge who doesn't register cases against the villagers as they all happen to be his relatives. By this time, you realise the narration is pretty linear. The bad guy is bad, the good guy is better &amp; the heroine (Kajal Agarwal) is the best! Yes! She breaks into an impromptu song on a strange island when the hero reciprocates her proposal of love. My friend used that time to take a pee-break. Great!This is precisely the kind of movies that filled the Indian screens during the 80's and early 90's. Characters had no complex shades. Hero enters the screen with a sole motive to finish the villain's role. Pretty-faced heroines are used as eye-candy. Well, the director (Rohit Shetty) and team had promised the same. So no complaints, please.Although Singham follows the rule to the 'T', it adds a bit of garnishing to the old recipe. The movie does have many believable moments which make you go "Awww". A side character (a veteran Ashok Saraf) is used to highlight the problems of a policeman and his reasons to stray from the expected path of virtue. The heroine motivates her beau when he feels low and incompetent against the villain's might. She unfailingly stands behind him to hold his gun &amp; shirt while he flexes his biceps and lashes the bad guys with his belt. By the way, was it made of leather or rexin? The answer certainly deserves a place in a sequel.The Marathi-heavy dialogue delivery packs punches throughout the story while hero delivers the kicks (literally!) to different people. The climax is aptly handled by the over-hamming acting of National Award winning Prakash Raj (Wanted, Kanchivaram) who seems to be the perfect import from the south-side for such movies. He runs through the fake buildings in town (by cinematographer Dudley) with lots of police-vans chasing him. Typical of Rohit Shetty films. He is a true lover of cars. Please watch his movies if you are one. You may learn how to pull villains out of cars that rotate more than a helicopter over your head or give a rose to a girl when you happen to be in such a car (All the Best: Fun Begins - 2009).Masala films such as this one, often have a great music score to boast of (like the original Tamil Singam and the recent Dabangg). But the music here by the Gogavale brothers is plainly forgettable. All you remember is the title track's roar. Other songs are simply a bore.6 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Singham directed by Rohit Shetty is a long,loud and tiresome work.By the time the end credits roll,you feel exhausted.The movie does offers some clap-worthy dialogs and amazing performances by Prakash Raj and Ajay Devgn.But still it falls apart.Story:- How an honest police officer overpowers an corrupt politician.The direction is plain average.The best scenes of the movie are when Ajay Devgn kicks the butt of a politician and even the climax The music is plain.The action scenes are shot nicely.The dialogs are the high-point of the movie.Each and every dialog was cheered by everyone.Singham is a one-time watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awesome movie but need more action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no doubt that "Singhum" is a good action movie. Mark my word, its good but not best. From my point of view there are so many car crashing scenes in this movie but it would be more better if the fights are shown more than that. I think Rohit loves car crash. In most of his films he has crashed and smashed so many cars and always he shows some different style of crashing. As its Ajay's film, peoples are expecting more action. But overall its a good one. Oh i must give some thanks to Sonali Kulkarni, as we are missing her from a long time in film. I really loved her movie's. Prakash's style is as usual great. He shows his own style of doing villain act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superman without his underwear.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a very good reason for reviewing this movie slightly later than I should have - I didn't want to watch the movie. I had reached a point where I wasn't willing to go even if someone else paid for my tickets. Seeing the trailer twice had put me off. I knew what to expect - an angry, testosterone charged, righteous man with biceps the size of watermelons beating the living daylights out of a stereotypical goon. But a bunch of Afghani terrorists eventually knocked me out with excessive chloroform, covered my head with a sack that smelled of soiled underwear and before I knew what was happening, I found myself seeing the opening credits to the movie Singham. Was my sceptical self surprised with the film? No. Was my sceptical self proved wrong? Of course not.Bajirao Singham (no he isn't a Tamil-Muslim-Hindu triple cross) is an honest police officer living in the town of Shivgarh. He is a hardworking vigilante, deserving of all the respect bestowed upon him by his townsfolk. He can be termed as Superman without the underwear; yes, he is that strong. He crosses paths with evil-politician-gang leader- corrupt-man-extortionist-kidnapper Jaykant Shikre. They fight. Physics is raped. End of story.Ajay Devgn has run a full loop. After experimenting with action, romance, dramas, comedy and even a musical, he is back to where he started from. This time, he has come well prepared to stun the audience with his thoroughly ripped body, leaving not a single muscle that can't kill men if hit with. As Bajirao Singham, he is the cop that you always wanted to see in your neighbourhood. Ajay Devgn suits this image well. There are several allusions to him being a lion, and a lion he is. Anything that gets in between him and what he wants can be considered as good as annihilated; and that includes men, cars and everything else remotely movable. The only grudge I bear against him is his total disregard towards destruction of public property, but that's quickly forgiven as he relentlessly kicks ass in novel, entertaining ways.Prakash Raj as Jaykant Shikre is the perfect match for this macho-man- with-his-butt-on-fire. He is a vile, wicked and ruthless thug with an ego as big as Singham's bulges. The two form a made-in-Heaven couple, each very well justifying the existence of the other. He also has a caustic sense of humour which is much-appreciated in the tense atmosphere. However, the worst part of him is not that he kidnaps children, tortures men or drives officers to the point of suicide; it is that he is corrupt. Yes, the 'C' word. That is reason alone for all of the audience to join hands against him and cheer Singham as he repeatedly goes Rambo on Shikre's defences.Somewhere in the middle of the movie, or earlier if you are smart, you may realize that the movie could have as well be shot on the moon. The film probably made Isaac Newton toss in his grave. There is nothing that even remotely obeys the laws of physics in the movie; by that I mean no gravity, no inertia and neither any sense of force. Singham can basically do whatever the hell he wants to, and that includes jump onto people flying in mid-air, uproot light poles cemented onto a surface or kick a chair to Mars. This could have been forgiven if he had been a Superhero with superpowers dressed in a super-costume, but since that's not the case, it just alienates the movie from reality. Though the crowd loved this, with some hardly managing to hold onto their seats due to the excitement, adrenaline or booze, I was just left bewildered.There are aspects that are unremarkable about the film. The music is crass and boring. Except the lead song there isn't anything of the music that you carry with you outside the theatre, and that thing you do, the lead song that is, gets stuck in your head like a non-terminating loop. There are shots in slo-mo, as you'd expect in any action flick. It also has a retro touch to it, which is currently the new hot, chick of Hindi cinema. Viewers are going to love it. Powerful lead performances, death- defying stunts, old-school action sequences; it's going to sell like hotcakes in famine inflicted Somalia. That is if the Somalians are into bakery products and all that.But from a critical point of view, the romance is mawkish, with the obligatory girl-by-the-hero's-side, Kajal Agrawal getting onto your nerves. She is loud, boisterous and clearly excited to be in Bollywood. In all honesty, she sucks. Most of the side-cast is just a waste of screen-space. They are like unwanted flab on someone's behind. On a random note, I think I must learn to give better similes.The film has a historical baggage of its own - it is a remake of a Tamil movie titled Singam (notice the missing 'h'; that's the creativity). It is about time Indian directors learnt that remaking Tamil films isn't entirely a smart thing to do. Add to it dialogues in Marathi. The crowd gets turned on. Hoots, cheers, wolf-howls. Ringing cash counters. Disgusted critic.It only proves once again that Bollywood still hasn't grown up.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of time and money</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the worst movies of the year. Has no proper story line as one cannot understand why a village grown police would pick a fight with a state level notorious villain. Singham a village cop picks up an issue with a MLA wannabe baddie and finally defeats him. Ajay Devgan is seen with a frown all through the movie and does not have any emotions on his face. Action sequences are copied from various Bollywood and a few Hollywood movies, but have been done with utter disregard to laws of physics. All in all a waste of time a money, can watch the original Tamil version instead. At least its a entertainer if not a pain in the @$$.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Back to the 90s :)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I thought it was the serious version of Dabangg (the Salman Khan starer; which I don't understand why people love so much!). But it's not like that. It's more like those movies in the 90s where 1 hero could fight with 50 people together, where the songs were evenly distributed throughout the movie, like there'll be a song-dance sequence even towards the end.Ajay (the hero) is Singham, a brave cop in a small village where everyone adores him. He enters into an argument with the villain (corrupt and powerful) who decides to make his life hell. Ajay performs nicely but my favorite is the villain. The heroine (a new-comer) is okay. The songs are not good.The starting is okay, picks up pace till the mid but the ending was a bit stretched out (and a little boring). However, an okay movie with some decent performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Golmal 4 in Salman Khan mold</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended the first day's late-night show hoping to see the angry Ajay Devgan of the old. A little did I know that it turned out to be a laughter-fest. With the first song ? title song "Singham" ? I felt that the movie is either an intentional satire of Sallu-style movies or a blatantly bad and predictable action movie. The only reason I'm giving it five stars is because I interpreted the movie as a satire; I did laugh a lot, not on the comedy scenes, but on the unintentional, satirical work of Rohit Shetty. For those wanting to see Ajay's mojo, there's just one thing to say: please, please, please, avoid. Does it entertain? Yes ? using an extended definition of entertainment. Is it meaningful? A big no.</fullReview>
