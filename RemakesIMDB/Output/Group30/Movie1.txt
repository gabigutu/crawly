		<shortDescription>PawanKalyan streamlined in action.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PawanKalyan looks adorable in this movie. His expressions in almost all the scenes in this movie came out quite natural and near perfection. His costumes, especially in Song sequences have brought a fresh look. Sandhya, played his sister, is a gifted artist. With in her scope she did it wonderfully. VenuMadhav, played his friend, is multi-talented. I would give ten out of ten for his performance, especially his ending scene. SivaBalaji, played his brother-in-law, has very little scope in this film. He looks pretty good. TelanganaSakuntala, played his friends mother, was good, but her voice abruptly gets loud which is not comfortable. Asin, played his girlfriend, looks pretty with Telangana accent. Nagababu, his real life brother, seems deliberately underperformed, of course his role is limited too. Some of the villains, except AsishVidyarthi, are not as impressive. The conservations between PawanKalyan and Sandhya are what I liked the most. Pawan's dialog delivery is strong and convincing. Rerecording is good. Songs are adequate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very clichéd...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the DVD last night and have to say its pretty tough to decide whether I liked it or not. I am a fan of Pawan Kalyan but I felt the movie wasn't up to his expectations. the story is very clichéd and so is the acting of Pawan Kalyan. You feel like you've seen it again and again in various Indian movies. When listening to the music on CD, it sounds pretty cool but the picturizations and dances didn't go well. Comdey was very dry except for a few dialogues here and there of Ashish Vidyarthi (claiming he raped a girl at the age 14). Fights were boring and the same old, same old (goons flying away at the punch of hero). But a few things i liked about the movie was the strategies that Pawan Kalyan uses to eliminate the bad guys in the second half.Its a typical movie fans may enjoy but a regular audience wont like.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This what we want from Pawan kalyan</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film once again proves the potential of pawan kalyan, the star with exalted image statewide performed unbelievably shockingly surprised everyone.After the release the sensational film like 'Khushi', there is no notable hit for Pawan Kalyan and his fans and audiences were in a depressed mood due to the poor situation.However, the successful combination of 'Suswagatham' ? producer RB Choudary, director Bhimaneni Srinivasa Rao and Pawan Kalyan ? once again joined hands and brought out an extraordinary film Titled 'Annavaram'.This is a perfect mass film with excellent fights and songs.. Exclusively "nee valle"song was rocking and mind blowing in which Pawan performed Aikido martial arts. His dance was good in all the songs. Indeed it was a great gift to his entire fans world wide.There is much to say about Director Bheemaneni srinivasa rao.. .He did good job . Incorporating lot of nativity feelings to suit the taste of Telugu audience. All his films are encrypted with family entertainment, sentiment, emotions, and tones of comedy. He knows perfectly what to deliver his audience. Being a successful and main stream Director there was much responsibility on his shoulders to make this film success at any cost. This was completely a different genre film for director bheemaneni srinivasa rao to handle. He proved and satisfied emerging as a fruitful commercial director.If we talk about the story... Its very simple, a brother wants to see happiness in his sisters eyes forever. He kills all the major counterparts to keep his sister's place clean.Good film after a long break. And it's good news that this film has crossed its share 14 million after the release of first week.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Annoyingly mindless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mess with an upright man and see what happens?! He'll unleash a wave of gory violence sweeping up all who wronged him, all the while meticulously finding opportunities for song/dance sequences with nearly-naked gorgeous young women. This, as outrageous as it seems, is the formula for a successful Telugu Cinema. Annavaram is a spectacular failure at implementing this ridiculously sure-fire formula. Pawan Kalyan, coming hard on the heels of a highly disastrous "Bangaram", ends up leading another crime against the motion picture.The storyline is hard to understand. Frames, with no obvious inter-connections, jump at you. There is no adequate justification for the violence perpetrated by the hero. The 'sister-sentiment' that pervades the first half is so pathetically artificial that it is actually amusing. Comedy is non-existent, though a whole troupe of comedy actors make their appearance. Venu Madhav overdoes his part so much, one actually wishes he were killed much earlier in the film. In his revenge, the hero is neither an emotionally charged action machine nor a calculating, cold-blooded plotter. So what is he like? What exactly is his mission? why does he think anything he does solves what he thinks is a problem? The half-baked approach of the film raises a family of such questions. But thankfully, the average Telugu film goer is not equipped to think logically. If you, however, belong to the precious minority who do, I presume to suggest chewing pieces of broken glass as an activity much more pleasurable than watching 'Annavaram'.</fullReview>
