		<shortDescription>The Lubitsch Touch Is Felt Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The DESIRE for a fabulous string of pearls has unexpected results for the beautiful thief.Bearing the unmistakable impress of its legendary producer, Ernst Lubitsch, here is a stylish concoction of witty dialogue &amp; sophisticated romance sure to please the most discriminating palate. It is a shame that the film is so badly neglected, as it is a joy from start to finish. With impeccable production values, the film is also a study in handsome sets &amp; costumes.Gorgeous Marlene Dietrich ravishes the eye with her sheer physical presence, but her beauty should not detract from her acting ability, which is considerable. She presents us with a woman of mystery &amp; slowly, deliberately, allows us to acquaint ourselves with her character. She imbues it all with a real sense of humor, which makes her first scenes, in which she pulls off a classic jewel robbery, all that more delightful.Rawboned &amp; enthusiastic, there is very little mystery swirling about Gary Cooper, playing an American auto engineer working in Paris. Embracing all life might bring him in his first trip to Spain, he is wide open and ready for passionate romance when Dietrich blows into his life. Their screen time together is charged with sensual electricity which no Production Code could disguise.Deftly underplaying the menace of his role, John Halliday is dangerously suave as a thieving ?prince' who manages to keep one step ahead of the law. Ernest Cossart &amp; Alan Mowbray are wonderful as Parisian gentlemen who fall victim to Dietrich's schemes (one has his pearls purloined, the other gets his dignity damaged).Elderly English actress Zeffie Tilbury is given an unusually choice role, playing the matriarch of the gang of thieves. Arriving late in the proceedings, with only a few scenes she is able to make us wish we knew a lot more about her character.In much smaller roles, William Frawley as Cooper's boss &amp; Akim Tamiroff, as a Spanish police official blinded by Dietrich's beauty, do well with their few minutes on the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by Frank Borzage and produced by Ernest Lubitch, that alone is a guarantee of something very special. On top of that, Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich in a fast, furious, magical duet. He is a charming Forrest Gump on vacation, she is a born seductress, a jewel thief, a woman on the verge of being beyond redemption. The dialog could have been written today even their talk about war. The camera had a real love affair with Cooper and Dietrich. Their feelings so visible. He in love like a school boy and she discovering him and herself, bit by bit. There are moments of Dietrich staring at Cooper that are a masterpiece on their own right. She is seeing something she has never seen before - innocence at its purest state. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper show an unexpected flair for romantic comedy that goes into high gear during DESIRE. They are surrounded by some expert supporting players, including Alan Mobray as a doctor who is "taken" by Marlene's sly and crafty jewel thief.The plot is thin but pleasant and moves at a fast clip with ample chemistry between Dietrich and Cooper more than making up for the slight story. When Dietrich accidentally lets Cooper get away with the pearl necklace she has stolen, she has to follow him and lure him back with some fancy scheming. John Halliday has fun with his role as her consort in crime but it is Alan Mobray who has the plum supporting role as the doctor she so charmingly deceives.Diverting entertainment with Dietrich expert as the exotic jewel thief under Frank Borzage's direction. The whole picture has such a light touch you'd think it was directed by Ernst Lubitsch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you liked Lubitsch's Trouble in Paradise, this is a lesser but still quite enjoyable version. Directed by Borzage and produced by Lubitsch, it is difficult to find but features a marvelous Dietrich and adorable Coop. The opening scenes quickly show you why Paris by Paramount was often considered better than Paris as itself. Charming lines like 'I'm going to put my hand in your pocket' were clever ways to overcome the Hays era constraints. The elegance of the era is well presented here combined with the straight up-ness of the 'good American' culture. There are also poignant references to the oncoming WWII through lines like 'Don't underestimate America, it's a big country', quite prescient since this was still 1936. If you like American Romantic Comedy of the 30's, you will enjoy this film...a shame they don't make 'em like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Continental suspense done excellently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dietrich is a sexy jewel thief who robs (and lives) by manipulating every male in her vicinity. Cooper, as an auto engineer on a vacation in Spain, proves no different, as he unwittingly carries the stolen gems for her across the Spanish border, but she soon falls for his energetic sincerity (not to mention his tall, broad shoulders) but must continue to lie to him to avoid arrest and disgrace. Eventually, instead of turning thieves together (which would have been more interesting), they decide to go straight and return the jewels. This is the type of thing that started to pop up in these kind of films after the reforms of the early thirties. The film's second half is thus less fun than its first, but it emerges as a solid comedy/romance package.</fullReview>

Here we have Cooper and Dietrich at their best and watch them having fun together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dietrich and Cooper steal away some laughs in this breezy romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marlene Dietrich stars as a European jewel thief who comically pilfers an extremely rare and expensive pearl necklace from a renowned jewelry store in France. Making her escape through Europe, she keeps bumping into a persistent, not-so-bright, vacationing American motor engineer played delightfully by Gary Cooper. After blowing he and his advances off several times, she realized that he unknowingly has obtained her stolen prize, and now she must find him in Spain and play up to him romantically. The film is very breezy and light most of the way, and Cooper and Dietrich do a fine job together. Meanwhile, Ernest Cossart as the jeweler and Alan Mowbray as a psychiatrist who is an unwitting accomplice to Dietrich have a great comedic scene with each other early on in Mowbray's office. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

She could have done whatever she wanted with him but she can't go as far as she might have because she falls in love. What a delight! Cooper's simpleton is a perfect target for a swindler and yet nothing truly harmful comes to him because he's protected by his own decency. What a delight! Lubitch producing this time, manages to infuse his glorious magic in this remarkable equation. I enjoyed it so much that I had to see it again immediately. What a delight!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Vacation Business Trip Turned Jewelry Heist - While Driving a Bronson 8</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ernst Lubitsch was one of the co-producers of DESIRE with it's director Frank Borzage. Borzage was a good enough director to have handled the material of this delightful romantic comedy, but Lubitsch fans feel that he frequently discussed the film with Ernst, and the famous "touch" has been noted throughout it.Gary Cooper is an ace salesman for the Bronson automobile company in Paris, working under William Frawley. He is about to go on his well earned vacation, but Frawley has a slight plan of his own. He is giving Cooper a new Bronson 8 automobile to use on the trip, which will carry a large sign on it advertising the car. In the meantime, unconnected to this, Marlene Dietrich has been involved in a neat piece of jewelry theft. She goes to the jewelry firm of M. Duval (Ernst Cossart) and arranges for him to deliver his finest necklace to "her home", the address of which is the home of Dr. Pacquet (Alan Mowbray). Later she goes to Dr. Pacquet's office (he is a psychiatrist), and explains she is Madame Duval, wife of the jeweler, and that he is suffering a strange dementia. She says that he insists that purchases are being made by all sorts of people, including the good psychiatrist. She begs Pacquet to let her bring her husband that night to see him, warning him that he will claim that the psychiatrist owes him a huge sum of money for a necklace. Pacquet agrees. So Dietrich sets up a neat confrontation between the two men, leaving with the necklace while they are arguing about who owes money v. who is crazy.Dietrich and Cooper get involved when she hides her stolen jewels in a bag of his at the border, and subsequently steals and wrecks his car. He still has the jewels though, and follows her. She and her suave, if sinister cohort (the wonderful John Haliday) decide to invite him to their home in the mountains, where they plan to retrieve the jewels before Cooper leaves. And that is all of the plot I will discuss.As I once mentioned regarding a later Cooper film (LOVE IN THE AFTERNOON), while Cooper was seen as the great American hero in westerns and adventure films, he was leading an active social life in high society circles. His direct American character, so fitting in THE PLAINSMAN or in HIGH NOON also could shoot off a gentle charm at times, and it works well in DESIRE. He and Dietrich had made MOROCCO six years earlier, but that was set in the deserts of North Africa and was a straight drama. Here they both mingle his American ruggedness and charm against her European sophistication and charm, and it works nicely. They are ably abetted by Haliday, pretending to be Dietrich's uncle but jealously watching Cooper's moves. The results is a well made romantic comedy that never fails to please the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pearls before fine (people).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first part will puzzle Borzage's fans because it's not his usual style:it's a comedy and the fans of "little man what now?" "no greater glory" or "lucky star" may not get something out of it.Not that Borzage had not broached comedy before:one of his first talkies was "they had to see Paris" ,a sometimes ponderous satire of American naiveté in France,a country Borzage particularly loved (see "Seventh heaven" or "hearts divided" ."Desire" begins in France with a nice shot of "les Toits Sous Le Ciel De Paris".The scenes between the jeweler and the shrink are sheer genius and have inspired since many screenwriters.Gary Cooper as the naive (not so naive anyway) American and Marlene Dietrich as the elegant glamor false countess make an ideal pairing:he is hot,joyful,singing and she is cold ,remote,suave and there is a special chemistry between them (there are other ladies with whom Cooper was particularly brilliant:two good examples are found in "unconquered" with Paulette Godard and "cloak and dagger" with Lili Palmer,another German actress ) This is also the movie where you 'll find the longest honk in the history of cinema.The only movie where they're talking international politics without being political.Towards the end ,the movie almost turns dramatic ,notably when aunt Olga tells Dietrich about love which is more valuable when it remains impossible.This is not among my favorite Borzage (considering " three comrades" "mortal storm" and "strange cargo" were still to come) but it's really much fun to watch and it is to be recommended .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No doubt of it, in Desire Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich were definitely fated to be together from the first time they had that fender bender in Paris before Coop got a good look at Dietrich and those celebrated gams.Marlene Dietrich is a countess, but one of those members of the nobility upon whom hard times have fallen. She and a partner John Halliday support themselves through some clever jewel robbery. In fact she pulls one classic scam on jeweler Ernest Cossart and psychiatrist Alan Mowbray and winds up with a valuable pearl necklace.The getaway proves to be a bit of a problem and she hooks poor innocent Gary Cooper at the customs inspection between France and Spain. She slips the swag into his pocket and at that point she's stuck with him. But it soon proves to be a very pleasant experience.Desire was produced by Ernest Lubitsch and directed by Frank Borzage. There's definitely more Lubitsch than Borzage in this film. Borzage normally directed heavy duty romantic tragedies and his favorite leading lady was Margaret Sullavan in films like Three Comrades and The Mortal Storm. It's unusual for someone not die in one of his films. I'm not sure Lubitsch didn't direct a lot of this himself.This was Dietrich and Cooper's second teaming, the first being the far more serious Morocco in which Dietrich made her American film debut. For some reason Desire was something the American movie public wasn't all that crazy about. I'm not sure why it's light and entertaining and should have done better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Takes a Thief</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DESIRE (Paramount, 1936), directed by Frank Borzage, introduces Marlene Dietrich into the genre of comedy, not so much in a sense of screwball or slapstick, but that of sophisticated comedy in the style of director Ernst Lubitsch, who also produced. Teamed opposite Gary Cooper for the first time since MOROCCO (1930), he and Dietrich are at their best here in what proved to be their final collaboration on screen. Cooper plays Tom Bradley, an engineer from Detroit, Michigan, assigned in a Paris-based auto company, who's determined to take his long-awaited vacation in Spain, regardless of how Mr. Gibson (William Frawley), his employer, might feel about it. Gibson (William Frawley), president of Bronson 8, however, surprises Bradley by approving his vacation by loaning him the company car carrying a sign which reads, "I am happy to drive a Bronson 8" as advertisement. Marlene Dietrich is later introduced as Madeleine de Beaupre, a continental jewel thief who cleverly gains possession of a pearl necklace from Aristide Duval (Ernest Cossart), a Parisian jeweler by posing as the wife of the famed psychiatrist, Doctor Maurice Pauquet (Alan Mowbray). Her path with Tom soon meets as they head to the border and await for customs to inspect their belongings. After Madeleine places her stolen pearls in Tom's coat pocket, they each pass inspection and go on their way. Purposely disabling her car, Madeleine is soon picked up by Tom and becomes his prize passenger. Eventually she drives off with his car, leaving him stranded on the road, unaware that Tom still unwittingly has the pearl necklace on his person. Abandoning the car after realizing her error, their paths meet again at the San Sebastian Continental Palace where Madeleine, posing as a Countess accompanied by her "uncle," Prince Carlos Margoli (John Halliday), her confederate, uses their friendly persuasion to get back the pearls without arousing any suspicion. When things become more complicated, Aunt Olga (Zeffie Tilbury), a third member of the gang of thieves, enters the scene.For his profile on the film, Bob Osborne, host of Turner Classic Movies where DESIRE premiered in January 2002 as part of the station's tribute to Marlene Dietrich, spoke about its production and original title being THE PEARL NECKLACE as more suitable than DESIRE, and rightfully so. It's interesting to point out that its title may stir up some confusion with another film of similar name, DESIRABLE (Warners, 1934) that also featured DESIRE co-star, John Halliday. Halliday, as stated, filled in for former MGM lead actor, John Gilbert, following his sudden death in January 1936. What a missed opportunity for Gilbert in a supporting role as Carlos, which might have proved favorable, though quite unlikely as one posing as Madeleine's uncle. Seen in a smaller role is Akim Tamiroff playing the police official, who would achieve recognition in another Cooper film that same year, THE GENERAL DIED AT DAWN (1936). Regardless of frequent revivals on commercial television back in the 1970s and public TV during the 1980s, DESIRE is quite underrated and nearly forgotten by today's standards. For being such an enjoyable adventure heist comedy from start to finish highlighted by many witty lines and situations, it's understandable why DESIRE is often mistaken as full fledged film directed by Lubitsch comedy rather than Borzage, best known for love stories with sentimental appeal. There may be some romance going on between the characters enacted by Dietrich and Cooper, but no sentimentality involved. In her attempt in retrieving her stolen pearls, Dietrich does take time out to recite the film's theme song, "Awake in a Dream" composed by Frederick Hollander and Leo Robin. And be sure not to miss the film's conclusion. It's as priceless as the pearl necklace itself. (***1/2 pearls)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Tom (Gary Cooper) encounters Madeleine (Marlene Dietrich) on his way to holiday in Spain. Unknown to him is the fact that she has just stolen $2 worth of pearls and is trying to smuggle them into Spain. She slips the pearls into his jacket pocket without him noticing so she can avoid the customs search. However, he takes off his jacket and packs it into his suitcase forcing her to stick with him until a moment arises where she can get the pearls back. Things don't work out as planned for her as when they part company, Tom still has possession of the pearls. Her partner in crime Carlos (John Halliday) is not happy with her when Tom suddenly shows up again. However, Madeleine is romantically won over by Tom, who is still unaware that he is carrying the valuable pearls, and this changes her plans.....The film has a good cast with a special mention for Zeffie Tilbury as "Aunt Olga" who turns up late in the film - an old, frail lady on the outside but a cold, emotionless criminal at heart. She advises Madeleine to forget about love - it is much better to have the memory. There are many good scenes, eg, the end scene at dinner when Tom gradually reveals to Carlos what he knows about the theft, the beginning scene when Madeleine is carrying out her scam, the scene at customs on the border of Spain where we are unsure of who is going to get busted and how, etc. The story gets going from the outset and is played with humour. Cooper is funny as the salesman, eg, when he discusses which is the better word - "delighted" or "glad" - to his boss before he goes on holiday. The good cast keep the story going but unfortunately, the ending lets things down a bit. It's far too goody-goody.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First, I give kudos to both the camera man as well as the makeup artists. They did an exceptional job in presenting Ms. Dietrich--she's as pretty as I've ever seen her in a film. While I have never been a fan of her work and never found her particularly attractive, they make the absolute most of what she's got in this film. She did appear appropriately tantalizing and her acting was excellent. Maybe I need to see a few more of her films so I might re-appraise her work.The plot is very hard to believe--not so much as having Dietrich play a jewel thief, but that she would steal and destroy Gary Cooper's car and he wouldn't be a lot more angry about it! In fact, soon they are both head-over-heels in love!! I remember the last time some lady hit my car (she didn't even steal it)--I was much more likely to punch the lady in the nose than fall her her! Oh well, that's Hollywood of the 1930s. If you suspend disbelief about this, the rest of the film is a very entertaining romance. Plus, the end of the film will surely satisfy everyone. It's a very good effort only hampered by a few difficult to swallow story devices.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a lovely sophisticated movie romp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a delightful Ernst Lubitsch comedy romance, and the second of two films in which Dietrich and Cooper were co-starred. Frank Borzage is listed as director but producer Lubitsch has the signs of his sly romantic comedy all over this film.This was an important film in both stars' careers. It was important for Marlene because this was her first feature film released after ending her association with director Josef Von Sternberg. And this polished, light, breezy affair couldn't be more of a contrast to her previous outings with that director, with Dietrich demonstrating a droll ability with sophisticated comedy. It was an important film for Cooper, too (though Mr. Deeds Goes to Town was just around the corner for him, a film with a bigger impact upon his career). Cooper, though, showed that he, too, could play screen humor very well here, with, in my opinion, one of his most engaging and personable performances. The subtle skill of Cooper's humorous performance, in fact, may surprise those who think of him mainly as a tight lipped western star.The plot involves Coop as an innocent abroad American on vacation in France when he encounters Dietrich on the road (literally). She is beautiful and sophisticated. He is smitten, of course, but doesn't realize that the charming lady is also a jewel thief. I'll stop there, except to say that that this film is a polished delight, and the two stars have great chemistry.One aside- John Gilbert, Dietrich's current lover, had been slated for the role of Deitrich's suave cohort in crime. However, the role went to John Halliday instead. Deitrich had helped Gilbert stop drinking, but losing the role and news of Deitrich's affair with Cooper caused Gilbert to hit the sauce hard once again and he was soon dead of a heart attack. The role could have been a game changer for Gilbert. Too bad we shall never know.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately now forgotten easy-going crime comedy starring magnificent Marlene Dietrich and Gary Cooper. Two stars share electrifying chemistry on the screen (although Dietrich herself first mentioned that Cooper was too one dimensional). It's a lighthearted comedy with simple plot about jewel heist, where Dietrich is seductive and thief and Cooper is non suspecting Don Juan who is getting too mixed up. 'Desire' has it's own charm thanks to the witty dialogue and with some laugh out loud moments. It was produced (some scenes were also directed by) great Ernst Lubitsch, and his touch can be felt throughout the film. Probably not the greatest production by Frank Borzage and Ernst Lubitsch, but it's definitely amusing film and all those who love the 1930's type romantic comedies will find it entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dietrich saves this from disaster, but can't quite make it compelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>VHS rental. The second of a Borzage double bill (after A Farewell to Arms), this was something of a disappointment. Gary Cooper again, a charming somewhat countrified American engineer who gets mixed up with pearl thief disguised as petty noblewoman Marlene Dietrich in Paris and then in flight to Spain. The early scenes of Dietrich scamming both pearl merchant and psychologist into believing that the other is her husband are well-played, and the meet-cute moments on the road though a little labored are still -- cute. But around the time Dietrich's partner in crime Margoli (John Halliday) enters the scene the film slows to a deadly crawl, and knowing how it's going to finish I can't wait for it to do so. This seemed much lighter and less intense than the other Borzage films I'd seen, so I wasn't surprised to learn that Ernst Lubitsch was the producer (and rumored director of some scenes); the Lubitsch touch mixed with the Borzage romanticism doesn't really come off. Worth seeing for the two stars though, by all means, especially Dietrich who is as magnetic as ever.</fullReview>
