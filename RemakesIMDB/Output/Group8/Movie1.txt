		<shortDescription>Sex vs. love, a great movie to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know I know you look at the cast and say "Geez, another a brat pack movie from the 80's". However, this movie is really good. The scariest part is how accurate the movie is in portraying the challenge to find true love among young twenty something's in the eighties. All of which still applies today. Did David Mamet know something thirty years ago that we didn't? Even the four main characters and the different personalities they have are easy to relate too and understand because they are all people that we know or once used to know!!!!! Danny (Rob Lowe), a restaurant supply salesman, and Debbie (Demi Moore), an art director at an advertising agency, meet at a baseball game and later link up at a singles bar in Chicago. He's a handsome guy used to one-night stands; she's having an affair with her boss but is looking for something more romantic and less sleazy.After a one-night stand at Danny's apartment, Debbie tells him, "It's been a slice of heaven." She returns to her place where she lives with Joan (Elizabeth Perkins), a kindergarten teacher whose smart ass tongue discourages most men. Meanwhile at work, Danny's buddy Bernie, a Neanderthal barbaric like fellow (played beautifully by Jim Belushi) who sees himself as a lady killer, queries his friend about his date with Debbie.The affair continues, and Debbie decides to move in with Danny. Living together proves to be a difficult experience for them. They try out plenty of new positions for sex, but find that coping with each other's habits, quirks, and expectations is far more challenging. Danny's passivity and inability to open up bother Debbie. At one point, he discovers her looking through his private possessions for clues to his past life.Debbie, of course, wants them to be a couple, while Danny, hiding behind the myth of the independent male, doesn't want to tie himself down and so ends up treating Debbie as nothing more than a live-in sexual object. And if there isn't enough tension between them, Bernie and Joan are constantly trying to sabotage their relationship. Thus the beginning of the end starts when Danny and Debbie use the "L" word after a steamy night of passion. Danny's frustrations with his career spill over into his relationship with Debbie. More frustrations come about with his best friend Bernie giving him a hard time about being with Debbie, losing touch with his own free spirit partier identity and a lack of communication with Debbie. This ultimately leads to a gut wrenching break up scene followed by Danny's painful attempts to get Debbie back after he finally realizes that what he had was special and now wants back what he has lost.As I was watching this movie I found myself squirming in my seat while these characters struggle to relate to each other. It wasn't very difficult for me to remember that I had gone through the same heartbreaking downfall of a good relationship in my early twenties due to my lack of communication and inexperience regarding matters of the heart like Danny in the movie. And how difficult it can be to move on. My only peace of mind comes at the end when Danny and Debbie decide to start courting again. This time with the realization that they were both unrealistic and naive and that they will be better to each other because of the painful lessons learned. The voices inside Danny, Debbie, Bernie, and Joan speak volumes about the loneliness, anger, self-hate, and fear of men and women who remain perplexed about themselves and the opposite sex. About Last Night is a provocative portrait of young adults. A very underrated movie and a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>one of the best movies on being in love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is extremely entertaining and moving. Neither Demi Moore nor Rob Lowe has ever looked better (and you get to see plenty of them). The last scene never fails to get me, and the whole movie rings incredibly true on being in love. Hell, Demi Moore even looks and acts like a girlfriend I had when I was a little bit younger. This is a funny, smart movie that stays with you forever, and I will pay it the ultimate compliment: We are lucky it was made. Vastly underrated on this site, About Last Night is a ten.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Film gets ripped by most, but I like it. Rob Lowe &amp; Demi Moore find each other and enter on-again, off-again relationship. Demi has never looked better, and Jim Belushi is outstanding as Lowe's well-meaning but crude best friend. More realistic about relationships than most Hollywood productions.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Accurate Portrayal of a 1980s relationship - with interesting Best Friends!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1980's Chicago two attractive young people develop a very 1980's relationship. After falling into bed together on their first meeting they progress through a tentative relationship to moving in together, moving out again, and then possibly to some sort of reconciliation.The film was made contemporaneously with the period it is set in and is one of those films that evoke their particular time with well-observed accuracy. Demi Moore and Rob Lowe deliver strong performances as the articulate, successful ? and confused - central characters, with Moore in particular able to reflect on the developing crises with astute asides.The film possibly has two structural problems. First, it is too long. Boy endlessly prostrating himself in front of Girl he has sent packing gets tedious, and the tension regarding what may happen starts to dissipate.Secondly, the more-or-less mandatory Best Friend characters are almost too strong. Lowe's buddy James Belushi is a chauvinist slob, but also a bit of a charmer - and with some of the best lines. Moore's confidante Elizabeth Perkins may be something of a shrew, but a damned attractive one. These two take an intense dislike to each other from the start, and as the main romance stalls their relationship becomes by far the more interesting one with its vague possibility that such a sparky loathing just might lead to something more positive - if pretty combustible!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies about Sex, Love and Immature Relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Chicago, the salesmen of restaurant supplies Danny Martin (Rob Lowe) and Bernie Litgo (James Belushi) are best friends and womanizers. One night, the handsome Danny meets Deborah 'Debbie' Sullivan (Demi Moore) in a bar and they have one night stand. Debbie works in an advertisement agency and lives with her roommate and best friend, the kindergarten teacher Joan Gunther (Elizabeth Perkins), and falls in love with Danny.The infatuated Debbie moves to Danny's apartment and they have great sex but very few conversation. Their closest friends Joan and Bernie frequently try to sabotage their relationship. Five months later, Danny breaks with her and the brokenhearted Debbie returns to Joan's apartment. Meanwhile Danny grows up and misses Debbie, but maybe it might be too late for reconciliation. "About Last Night?" is one of the best movies about love, sex and immature relationship from the 80's and one of my favorite films ever. The charming lead characters are wonderfully performed by Demi Moore and Rob Lowe that show a magnificent chemistry. The story is realistic and shows the difficulties of a young couple to live together, with four young central characters of twenty and something years old: Debbie is a young woman that has an affair with her boss and has a crush on Danny and wants a steady relationship. Danny is an insecure man frustrated with his work that does not want to have a commitment with Debbie. Bernie is chauvinist pig that sees women as sexual objects. And Joan is a frustrated woman that is constantly dumped by her boyfriends."About Last Night?" is a cult for people from my generation that certainly will find identification with the lead characters and their relationships. Last but not the least, Demi Moore is delightful to be seen in the 80's ("No Small Affair"; "St. Elmo's Fire" and "About Last Night"). My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "Sobre Ontem a Noite?" ("About Last Night...")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About as romantic a movie as possible, but definitely deserves its R rating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Debbie (Demi Moore) is a successful, young professional in the Chicago area. She and her friends like to hit the neighborhood bar and ogle the men. These women consider themselves "modern", that is, they are not looking for a lasting relationship, just a hot night with Mr. Good Looking. One evening, after a softball game, Debbie meets Dan (Rob Lowe). They are instantly smitten with each other, both being very attractive and very hormonal, and they spend the night together. Debbie tells him thanks for the "slice of heaven" and goes on her way. Yet, a day later, they end up calling one another on the phone, at the same moment. They set up a second date, which ends in another lusty evening. Fairly soon, they move in together but set up guidelines. None of this acting like a married duo, although they take turns cooking and shopping. Yet, is it possible for them to treat each other like roommates only and never let their hearts be touched? And, how long will their relationship last? This is truly a very romantic movie with many assets. Lowe and Moore are absolutely gorgeous, gorgeous human beings and lovely to look upon. The movie also has an intelligent, humorous, truthful and very touching script. Then, too, the costumes, Chicago setting, and cinematography are very worthy, indeed. However, if you like your movies without a lot of sexual encounters, this is not the film for you. This story is an exploration of the nature of modern existence, where sex and birth control are both readily available. As such, it has many eyebrow raising scenes of romantic tete-a-tetes. Therefore, if you prefer good, clean romance movies, try Return to Me or Only You instead. But, if you are willing to look past some fast and loose scenes in exchange for a truly touching and romantic film, get this one tonight.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Relationship Based Solely On Sex Seldom Works.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Demi Moore plays Debbie, the ad exec in loveless relationship with her boss. Rob Lowe plays Danny, a restaurant supplier in a loveless relationship with....well anyone really.The two meet in a bar after a baseball game and one thing leads to another and they jump into the sack with each other that very night. A casual sex relationship develops between the two for a few weeks until they decide to move in together, but that's when their problems really start.James Belushi &amp; Elizabeth Perkins plays Bernie &amp; Joan, Danny &amp; Debbie's best friends respectively. Belushi is a sexist, misogynist pig and Elizabeth Perkins is an uptight, feminist, man hater. Both think that Danny &amp; Debbie are making a huge mistake and with such conflicting viewpoints, they despise each other but Bernie is Danny's confidant and likewise Joan is Debbie's. They both have separate agenda's to split them up but set about it from very different angles.However, their input is not really needed as it soon becomes apparent to both Danny &amp; Debbie that basing a relationship purely on great sex is no basis at all and that the resulting peer pressure is just the straw being placed atop of the proverbial camel's back.About Last Night is generally pigeonholed as a comedy, but is more correctly a romantic drama with some comic moments attached. Moore &amp; Lowe play their parts really well as the two confused twenty somethings playing house, but it's the scenes that Belushi &amp; Perkins appear in, especially together, that really make the movie a must watch.About Last Night will please the guys because Demi gets her kit off regularly and it will please the girls because not only is it the one of the best '80's chick flicks but Rob gets his kit off too. It also has a great soundtrack to boot.It's about men, women, choices, sex, ambition, moving in, no sex, risk, underwear, friendship, career moves, strategy, commitment, love, fun, breaking up, making up, bedtime, last night...Enjoy!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Difference Between Boys and Girls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At 5.8 stars this is underrated, probably dismissed due to two brat packer leads (Demi Moore, Rob Lowe) at the peak of their annoying bratpackerdom. It turns out, however, ABOUT LAST NIGHT is surprisingly witty and literate. It takes an unusually soulful look at the differences between how 20-something men and women see love and relationships, and is one of the smarter romantic comedies of the past 15 years.There are a number of crisp and quotable dialogue exchanges (particularly between irascibly sexist Belushi and irrepressibly man-castrating Perkins), some funny but some heartfelt. The entire cast performs well, too, probably thanks to the steady hand of director Ed Zwick. In particular, Demi Moore is pretty darn good in both the light stuff (her memorable "female secrets" list to Lowe) and then later as the devastated and heartbroken weeper after the split. The usually cardboard Lowe is also surprisingly good, actually emoting and garnering our sympathy after foolishly breaking up with Demi but quickly realizing he has made a terrible mistake. As "Boy Meets Girl, Boy Loses Girl" scenarios go, ABOUT LAST NIGHT's premise israther routine. However, the execution is cleverer and we care about Lowe's and Moore's characters, who are appealing and well drawn. SNL veteran Tim Kazurinsky scribed the story, which has just the right touch of angst, tears and laughter. More than comedy, however, ABOUT LAST NIGHT takes a revealing and realistic look at differences between the way men and women think. Perhaps a bit shmaltzy in the end, but still a productive use of your time, and a generally worthy relationship movie. 8.5 / 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite Mamet scripts, About Last Night is true to life and a fine piece of film. I think most adults have known someone like the Jim Belushi character, or the Elizabeth Perkins character. This is one of the films that really captures real situations and makes them interesting, something that Mamet is the king of. I'm not a Rob Lowe fan, but here he was perfectly cast, as was Moore. If you've ever been single for any period of time, this is a movie for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>21 years later and this story remains true as ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just bought a DVD with About Last Night and St. Elmo's Fire, I figured since it was 5 dollars to give it a look. I watched About Last Night first, I have to say that this movie despite it's dated look and music, is still vital to today's world of love and sex. It's amazing how we still haven't changed that much, huh? But anyways, onto the movie, over all acting and the way that About Last Night was shot, I'd say this was a decent movie. It's still somewhat of a classic to this day, it starred a couple of the famous members of the brat pack, Demi Moore and Rob Lowe who had absolutely amazing chemistry on screen and really brought the relationship to life. While I admit, that this is very dated, it's all good, most of our movies will one day be dated, it's kinda fun to see what life was like then. I was only 1 years old when this movie came out, so those shoulder pads would've weighed me down, lol. Despite the dated look, the story is as true as it ever was today.Debbie and Danny, first off, how corny are these names put together? OK, back onto the story, they meet at their favorite bar and hook up, it seems like the most common one night stand. But they can't help but think of each other, so they continue on with their sexual relationship. But they are getting more and more serious with seeing each other, so they move in together, as just room mates as first. But eventually they decide to try a relationship as boyfriend and girlfriend. But things get very difficult with their two best friends who are just rooting for their relationship to crumble to pieces. Then they must confront the difficult part, is there anything they have past than just the physical attraction? You'll have to see for yourself.About Last Night is a good movie, the acting and over all film is average, it's watchable. It has a little comedy to it as well, so it's not all drama. It's got some steamy moments between Demi and Rob, I have to say that it was beautifully shot in the scene where they first say I love you to each other. But this movie really did get to me because I could totally relate to Demi's character on every level, I think that's another plus is that it is written very realistically and doesn't just have them be all happy again after all their problems, it's very realistic to what trials a relationship goes through. I would recommend About Last Night, it's a good film and a fun time capsule.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>After 20 years, it's still watchable!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was in my mid teens when this film first came out and I watched it for the first time a couple of years later when it was released on VHS. 20 years after its release, I still watch it because this is one of those rare films where the cast selection is superb and the acting is 10/10. Although the soundtrack is very 1980's, some of the music is timeless (for those who are interested, Mica Paris' version of "Words into Action" is just as good as Jermaine Jackson's original).In my humble opinion, Rob Lowe (Danny) and Demi Moore (Debbie) have by far the best on-screen chemistry that I've seen. Their portrayal during the emotional scenes are amazing and so realistic that they leave a "lump in my throat" every time. James Belushi deserves so much credit as the comic sidekick as does Joan (Elizabeth Perkins), Debbie's cynical friend.One thing though; I've always wanted to know what happened to their characters twenty years on. So, to Edward Zwick (Glory, Blood Diamond etc.): Do you fancy making a sequel; "About Last Decade"? Seriously, About Last Night is by far the vest romantic comedy from the past two decades and for that I give the film 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This romantic drama stars Rob Lowe and Demi Moore, who meet and fall in love early in the film and then take the viewers on a roller-coaster ride of emotions. This is a love story that provides several ups and downs as it moves through the peaks and valleys of the relationship. Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins provide some humor in interacting with each other and the two stars. They discourage the relationship between their best friends at times and provide emotional support on other occasions. A romantic film that takes a serious look at both the advantages and pitfalls of two people in love moving in together. Belushi provides enough laughs to keep the story from becoming excessively dramatic. In my personal opinion, this movie has been under rated by IMDb voters and could be considered required viewing for young couples contemplating a similar situation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Life, And Wrigley Field In Chicago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Last Night casts Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as a pair of 20 somethings living and working on the north side of Chicago. Rob is a salesperson for restaurant supplies and a pretty good one. But he lacks a college education and is reluctant to go back to school. He's also deathly afraid of commitment which means marriage and all that brings.But after he and Demi after a night's kanoodling which they agree is the best they each ever had, she moves in with him. The sex is fabulous, but can they learn to both like and tolerate each other?Each has a best friend that is working for mixed motives to sabotage the relationship. Lowe's best friend is Jim Belushi who's a cheerful hedonist and just doesn't want to lose his best friend and co-worker as a partner in debauchery. Demi's best friend is Elizabeth Perkins who just thinks Lowe is too good and too good looking to be true. She's been through the mill and does break up with a man during the film. She's concerned about Moore, but I think Perkins is a little jealous as well.About Last Night is taken from an off Broadway play by David Mamet who had more of a serious examination of human relations in mind than this brat pack film. Still as a brat pack film, it's pretty good and the location shooting in Chicago certainly helps. We even get to see some of the rooftop locations where one can see a ballgame in that most famous of north side landmarks, Wrigley Field.It might not be David Mamet's vision, but About Last Night is an all right film comedy from the Eighties. And no film that has Wrigley Field can ever be bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some Good and Bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Edward Zwick's "About Last Night" is a little bit more difficult to rate than your average movie. Despite for the most part, an annoying Jim Belushi character, the movie has quite a few good moments. The writing is good in spots as is the romance. There's a great scene at a diner "joint" that hits it right. Demi Moore and Rob Lowe indeed look fabulous physically - maybe the best I've ever seen each of them in any movie. One scene in particular of both of them standing on raised platform Chicago train station in snow and winter during the latter half of the movie is simply spectacular. However, they are little over-their- heads in the talent level needed to carry the movie. Both Lowe and Moore sometimes come off either not emotional enough or too emotional. They are decent actors, but not excellent. Elizabeth Perkins in for support may not look as beautiful as Moore, but she's clearly the better actress, and Belushi is again kind of annoying for the most part as the vulgar comic relief. The movie is certainly an 80s splash, with requisite MTV soundtracks and cussing - detractably so. But The drama is there and despite not hitting the stride, or sometimes mis-acted, it carries things. Mildly worth a watch; it's nice to catch a decent 80s drama that I haven't seen and like it overall. Recommended. 6.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Last Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original title of the film was going to be 'Sexual Perversity in Chicago' from David Mamet's stage play that this is based on, and the name change is understandable. Sexual Perversity is an intriguing name but it's also a bit too harsh. My biggest guess as to why the name was changed is because the film itself is nowhere near as intelligent or perceptive as a film with that risky a title should have.About Last Night explores the meeting of 20-something's Demi Moore and Rob Lowe and their relationship that follows. Moore is an advertising executive just getting out of a relationship with her boss. Lowe is working in a warehouse that ships restaurant goods. They meet during a baseball game and then again at a bar. Lowe invited Moore back to her place and they have sex and fall for each other, blah blah blah. Lowe's best friend (James Belushi) doesn't like this 'broad' - a phrase spoken constantly throughout; and Moore's roommate (Elizabeth Perkins) - is a cold hearted, selfish, cry-baby.Yes, that whole synopsis was mundane for a reason. About Last Night is not an interesting movie. We've seen how relationships form and progress and fall apart - so what does this film have to offer that's fresh and new? Well it's certainly not perspective. What we get are four young actors who whine, shout at each other, deliver bad one liners, and plain aggravate the audience.Who cheers for these people? There is no intelligence to these characters as in a scene when Lowe starts yelling at Moore because she won't throw her tampons away which 1 minute later results in Moore storming out of the apartment. Who acts like this?! Granted, I'm sure there is an audience for this movie as it currently has a 5.8 rating. I myself found no redeeming qualities in the characters, their actions, or in the film itself.I'm sure there are people out there in the world who act this petty and childish - but it's awfully hard to put up with these people for so long. The film itself clocks in just shy of two hours. There are not one, not two, but SIX montages. Including; The 'We're falling in love!' montage.The 'We're moving in together!' montage.The 'Our relationship is becoming deep and meaningful and full of sex clips' montage.The 'I'm Robe Lowe and where did I go wrong?' montage.There are two more. But I don't want to give away too much, although I'm sure most of you will be able to pick up on every little thing that will happen plot-wise after the first twenty minutes.And for those of you who have seen About Last Night there are many scenes that had me scratching my head saying "Why is THIS scene in the movie?"...The scene with Elizabeth Perkins reading to the children in her kindergarten class and then discussing sex briefly...That scene is just plain awful. Enough to make me see what other horrific moments this film would put me through. An excruciatingly annoying film filled with repellent characters. Lowe and Moore are pretty to look at, and if that does it for you, rent it. If not, avoid at all costs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Coming to terms with a loving relationship</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I missed this one when it was first released 28 years ago and didn't expect much from a movie that I thought only involved adolescent love and sex. Well, after seeing it, I came to a different conclusion because the movie was an honest story of a young couple (played by Rob Lowe and Demi Moore) who fall in love and decide to live together but cannot make the relationship work. Maybe it was the fact that they made an effort to admit they really cared for each other and tried to get past their youthful egos after the relationship first fell apart. They also tried to work things out with their their best friends who wanted to foil them from being together, in part because the friends (James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins) did not want to lose them. Lowe and Moore also show the loneliness of life following their relationship as they go to bars making futile efforts to find someone compatible. The script and acting was generally good, particularly Belushi whose character is typical of many young men who like their buddies and pretend to know how to snare women without getting involved with them. Belushi also delivered the best humour. I liked the location of Chicago with the skyscrapers, the elevated trains and the waterfront. it is still a good movie about life in the 1980's as two young people try to make the transition from bachelor life to a successful loving relationship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>the subject is old, the story is not original. but About last night... has the virtue to be more than part of a long chain. key - the special performance of Demi Moore and Rob Lowe, the spiced roles of Elizabeth Perkins and James Belushi, the music and something else, maybe the courage of scriptwriter and director to do more than a romantic comedy. because, in this case, the evolution of a couple is realistic, charming and perfect mixture between humor and tension, the chemistry between lead actors is seductive and the potential of roles are explored step by step.short, it is a smart manner to present evolution of a couple out of ordinary clichés or moralistic lesson. and this fact is important. and can be the detail who makes this film not only nice but , in a form, original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wanted to talk to you about last night....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Last Night is directed by Edward Zwick and adapted to screenplay by Tim Kazurinsky &amp; Denise DeClue from David Mamet's play, Sexual Perversity. It stars Rob Lowe, Demi Moore, James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins.Youngsters have one night stand and tentatively start a relationship that neither of them is equipped for.....At this point we don't know.It's a funny thing, or maybe it's not? But Edward Zwick's About Last Night is a far better film now than it was when I saw it as a 20 year old. Viewing with wiser adult eyes it resonates more, proving to be more than the Brat Pack pulp it seemed to be back then. Picture is a mature observation on the young relationship of Danny (Lowe) &amp; Debbie (Moore), one that is clearly taking on too much, too soon. Film dared to show 80s audiences that you have to work at relationships, use your brain instead of what is in your underwear. A big part of the piece is the sex, and its importance to the narrative, the steamy love making scenes underpin their passion whilst making sure we remember the fact that these two have been driven by their sexual urges. They know next to nothing about one and other, which surely is a recipe for disaster?Naive Nudes! On the edges of the frame are two slightly older but cynical best friends of the couple, Bernie played by Belushi is loud, brash, aloof and lives in the local bar, and Joan played by Perkins is bitter and in danger of being left on the shelf, these two actors are the best things in the film. However, there should have been more made of the characters, for although Danny &amp; Debbie are the core of the tale, Bernie and Joan's issues needed fleshing out for some further dramatic impact. Things aren't helped by Lowe and Moore being two of the prettiest actors around at the time, a blip because the dialogue and situation has realism in abundance, but the two "pretties" make it hard to fully believe and care about them.Uneven for sure, but the mature eye cast over proceedings makes this better than many other "young adult" romance pictures of the 80s. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dating in the 80s.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had nightmares that my future dates would turn into the emotional relationship epic portrayed in this film. But, alas, it never happened (fortunately).I don't have too much to say about this film, other than it's a window at how young couples used to frolic during the cultural renaissance that was the 1980s. When PCs were just becoming household items, cell phones were still big bulky affairs the size of military walkie talkies, Star Wars was still the premier sci-fi property while Star Trek lived on in re-runs. Noriega and Santiago were the bad guys of the era instead of the now deceased bin Laden and Hussein, and the Russkies were still communists.Things weren't a whole lot easier then. In fact, in spite of the lack of technology that we have today, I would say things probably got a bit more complicated on a social and interpersonal level between societies. But man and woman will always be male and female, and the convolutions of tip-toeing or barreling straight into a relationship while trying to find a way out of any previous attachment is the soup d'jour. Rob Lowe gives us the inner city good looking guy trying to make good who is, for whatever reason, unattached. Demi Moore's character, on the other hand, has a touch of either caring-mercenary as she plays with her superiors, or a naivete and care free spirit about whom she dates. The two meet. Sparks fly. Bodies entangle. Emotions flair. But will they stay together, and how will this effect their friends? Isn't that what all chick flicks are about?On the fringe in this tumultuous relationship are the dysfunctional friends. One obsessive and possessive, the other just highly immature for a grown man. Both of whom are vicariously living through their friends. How will this spice or dilute the lovers' romance? Anyway, yeah, this is how I remember the 80s... er, somewhat at least. I was never part of that singles scene, but I did witness it from a distance and smirked.It's a fine film about a slice of life that came and went. It's very well acted for what it is. Very solid performances, but nothing in regards to high drama. Nobody's dying here, it's just a tale of everyday happenings of a young couple, and how they navigate the hurts and loves of themselves and those around them.Not my favorite film, but it's a decent watch.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A warm,summer afternoon at the softball park between two workplace rival companies becomes the make-cute meeting for Debbie(Demi Moore,who,while hardly the greatest actress in the world,can still fit roles and is a perfect fit here),an advertising design artist and Danny(Rob Lowe,as '80s air-fluffed and perfect as ever),a condiments and insundries salesman feel an attraction,first there,then at the usual watering hole haunt. This being still the height of STDs being a "non-topic"(i.e. the mid-'80s,right on top of AIDS becoming a household topic),the attraction is a no-brainer for a one-night stand. But something happens: they find out they like each other and decide to pursue this relationship,much to either the dismay and/or astonishment of their best friends:Debbie's dour,cynical pal Joan(Elizabeth Perkins,one-note here but an EFFECTIVE one note)and Danny's bombastic buddy Bernie(Jim Belushi,having a good ol' time). From there,the course of almost an entire calendar year follows the events play out.Adapted from David Mamet's "Sexual Perversity in Chicago",it's pretty easy to notice(particularly to anyone with familiarity of Mr.Mamet's work) that this script is a far more palatable treatment for the screen than what you might've(I have yet to actually see this put to stage off original script)seen on original draft and/or performance. While this movie might turn off theater snobs(and possibly people with a low tolerance for '80s kitsch),anyone with an interest in seeing pretty actors(Lowe and Moore)playing for emotional range(and not doing too badly,IMHO)and solid,not quite looker actors(Belushi and Perkins,though Ms.Perkins HAS softened up over the years,becoming almost vampish looking herself)to sharpen up their acting fangs should be able to appreciate it. Directed by TV and film vet Edward Zwick(with a reworked title AND script from Second City and SNL vet Tim Kazurinsky,who has a cameo),this movie is deceptively advertised as a sex comedy,but actually has a softer,deeper,layered sense of itself. It's a good keeper of a film,worth at least a re-watch or two.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Judging by the ratings, i must be in the minority here. Myself, I liked this movie allot. Sorta brings back memories of my early 20's when i lived with a woman and trying to balance the party scene with the friends. Belushi's character is a riot. The scenes at the local watering spot brought back memories of my old hangouts. Also the fighting sequences seem to ring true with me. Who should clean the apartment, can each others friends deal with each other, still going out and having fun but being in a serious relationship. Its one of the 80's movies i still like to watch. Unlike others that i used to like back than like Sixteen candles or Pretty in Pink which i have scene lately and I'm like, this is garbage. I didn't have sandwich night, we had invite everyone over and party night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>About Last Night... (1986) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Based on David Mamet's play, the film tells the story of Danny (Rob Lowe) and Debbie (Demi Moore) who have a one night stand and then try to build a relationship from it even though both have friends (James Belushi, Elizabeth Perkins) warning them against it. You can find hundreds of love stories from the 80s but in my opinion this one here is without question one of the best even though when viewing it today there are a few problems with it. I think the positives are so strong that you can't help but view them as a contemporary classic. For starters, I think Mamet's play is an incredibly strong one that translates to the screen without any trouble and this is due in large part to the terrific screenplay that has some wonderful dialogue. While watching the film there's no question it deserves its R-rating but the dialogue seems incredibly fresh and like something you would actually hear between friends. The raunchy talk between Lowe and Belushi as well as the "other side" of things done in more adult manner between Moore and Perkins. The screenplay gets everything down so right that you can't help but feel you're watching a real relationship over the course of a year and when you see the ups and downs you feel as if this movie is giving it to you pretty straight. Another major plus are the performances and while the actors themselves might disagree, I'd say this is the best work any of them have done. Lowe and Moore make for the perfect couple and both of them make their characters smart, funny and of course at times dramatic. They are wonderful together during the sexual scenes and they really shine once the relationship gets started and of course begins to sour. Belushi is downright hilarious here and you can't help but wish you had a friend like him. Perkins is also very good in her role. The screenplay is all about relationships both sexually and more emotionally and I think the movie does a very good job at handling both of them. You can tell from the way the film was built that it's based on a play but this never hurts the film. Director Zwick does a very good job at handling the romance and mixing it in with the raunchy comedy and more dramatic moments. I think the film does run a bit too long and there's a bit too much music in it but ABOUT LAST NIGHT... is still one of the more memorable love stories of the decade. With the strong screenplay and performances, it still remains rather fresh after all these years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I seriously wonder sometimes if the entire decade of the eighties was a conspiracy to enable the young people of that time to remain children for their entire lives!In addition to the horrible music of the time, we had an entire catalogue of movies just like this one. Strike that, many of them were even WORSE than this one. (Xanadu comes immediately to mind).Demi Moore, who actually became a pretty good actor, "starred" (for lack of a better word) in several of these, including probably the poster child for all of them "St Elmo's Fire". These movies all had one thing in common: They portrayed people living unrealistically "hollywood" type lives, which inspired and already lazy and entitled generation to become even more so. And where are these "children of the eighties" today? Most of them (except for the ones that actually became yuppies, which are almost as detrimental to society) had a kid or three and are now on welfare, still holding their spoiled entitled breaths waiting for the world to be handed to them on a platter!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Microcosim Of The Typical 80's Relationship....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a perfect example of relationships in the 1980's. Given that the morality of the Reagan era never influenced the 20-somethings of that generation, it shows rather succinctly what happens when two people meet and jump into bed on the first date, then try to build a meaningful relationship based on that. Of course what was learned by those who tried doing that it way, was that it doesn't work. Nothing long-lasting can come from something as superficial as physical attraction. This film takes a funny look at those who were foolish enough to try and take the wrong road to happily ever after. Rob Lowe and Demi Moore have great chemistry together as the typical yuppie, 20-something 80's fun couple, Dan and Debbie. They're one of those cute brother/sister looking couples with strikingly dark hair and green eyes. Seeing them together, you can't help but picture them together as a real-life couple (their kids would've been gorgeous)! Their coupling takes the inevitable route: explodes on contact, then peters out when real-life issues enter the picture. Obtaining advice from their respective best-friends (his is psychotic, hers is promiscuous but hostile toward the opposite sex) only complicates matters. Things work out for them in the end though, when they decide to grow up and toss their unrealistic expectations of one another out the window. The 80's soundtrack is a blast from the past (hell, you can't blame Demi for being tempted to jump Rob's bones on the first date when you hear that hot song by Jermaine Jackson "Words Into Action" playing in the background). The smart and snappy banter between the principal characters makes it a fun movie all the way around. Not your usual chick flick. Highly recommended to all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>David Mamet turned into "thirtysomething"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book "Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!" Get it at Amazon.)This is a pretty good movie, although the initial effect is disconcerting, like watching a sit-com that is painfully real and not just escapist fare. The players, Demi Moore and Rob Lowe as the lovers, and Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins as their jealous friends, are very good, and Director Edward Zwick is to be complemented on getting so much out of all of them. The script, loosely based on David Mamet's play "Sexual Perversions in Chicago," is filled with sharp, clever and sometimes insightful lines worth quoting.One is when Moore breaks off the relationship with her boss to be exclusively with Lowe. Taken back, he says, "But I thought we had something special." She replies, "No. It was sleazy, and now it's over."Another is when Moore's sensitive and brutally sarcastic (and jealous) friend Perkins arrives for Thanksgiving and says to Lowe about cloddish, working-class Jim Belushi, who hasn't arrived yet, "Your vulgarian friend is downstairs denting innocent people's fenders."After the two lovers move in together, and she has more than a drawer in his apartment and doesn't have to carry an extra pair of panties in her purse, they begin with "I love..." (awkward pause) "making love with you" (pure Mamet). But when he doesn't share his feelings with her, she says, "I don't want to be your roommate anymore. I had a roommate."What she wants is emotional intimacy. A woman needs emotional intimacy because then she knows where she stands and she has some control. They move closer and she (caught unaware) says, "I love you." He (on the spot, camera close) replies, "I love you too." She sheds a tear, just one, as they hug, perhaps in joy, or perhaps because she doesn't know whether he really loves her or not, and it's so very, very important. The next day Belushi asks who said it first and cavalier Lowe says he did. Belushi, who boorishly fancies himself a lady's man, lectures his friend on just how very poor studly style that is."About Last Night" is really about forming and securing the bond between a man and a woman. It's trial by fire. Their emotions are on edge and their individuality is threatened. And all around them are people and circumstances, and their very own animal natures, testing and probing the strength of the bond. When it breaks the pain is enormous.Lowe says: "I didn't fool around. Not once!" Moore rejoins: "Give the boy a medal. I didn't realize it was such a sacrifice."Then comes her awkward and sad double date with the nerdy card trick artist with the British accent. Perkins says, "Couldn't you just listen to him all night?" and we're thinking, NOT for even one minute.Meanwhile we have Lowe's casual pickups. Meaningless sex, and then not even that. But when he saves his friend's cafe, he grows up.Belushi and Perkins are wonderful as "opposites attract." They fight the magnetism to the very end-speaking of which, the best part of the movie is the ending. It is perfect.It should be noted that the movie is larger than Mamet's one-act play and covers ground not even considered in the play. The play was a somewhat crude, but insightful, comedy about sex. The movie is a popular drama about relationships.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I grew up in this era, and it was a time when "living together" was a recently accepted practice, socially speaking, in even the smaller cities across the country. I had even lived in a rooming house where members of the opposite sex weren't even allowed outside of the common areas!Demi Moore is cute as the female lead, and I think Rob Lowe plays more off of her instead of the other way around. The plot is great for it's times, but, 20 years later, it dates itself. If nothing else, it reminds me what it feels like when you just get into that first long-term relationship.The really big thing that dates this movie is the roles played by Belushi &amp; Perkins. Although played very well, friends like that don't act like that (for the most part) because of the strain they know they put on Lowe &amp; Moore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How Many Times Have I Been To Mothers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I use to live a block away from all of those meat market bars on Rush St and Division in Chicago!! I spent more time in She-Nannigans than I did at my apartment!! The bar, She-Nannigans, was used as a location in the movie "Nothing in Common". What is so funny about this movie is that the meat market scene is centered around four confused characters, and, inevitably, a relationship manifests itself between Rob Lowe and Demi Moore!! I thought Rob Lowe was excellent in this film. Steven Eckholdt was one of the pivotal characters in this film, mostly in the manner by which he was a reflection of the way Rob Lowe use to be!! Steven Eckholdt is very talented and has had a very successful television and movie career!! So many scenes take place inside a bar which was suppose to be Mothers, a bar which is located on the northwest corner of Division St that is open until 5:00 am on Saturdays!! The actual bar which they called Mother Malones, is a bar which used to be called Gingerman!! The heart in the center of the Mothers logo signifies the nefarious gang of mobsters known as Ma Barker and her boys!! This was a symbol the mother, Ma Barker, put on the box of her son's birthday cakes!! This film evokes the entire sordid aura of the Division St scene, including the part about everyone getting together at Five Faces after the evening of getting drunk until sickness comes to a conclusion!! Five Faces is a sandwich place that all of the inebriated dipsomaniacs would congregate at when the drinking and the ill fated attempts at getting lucky were over.. Why is it called Five Faces? The front of the building has five faces painted on it!! They are: Lucille Ball, Humphrey Bogart, Elvis Presley, James Cagney and Marilyn Monroe!! With all the drunks in the place, Sh-- Faces is what it should really be called!! The movie "About Last Night" captured the era of the eighties Rush and Division St scene very astutely!! Bars on Rush and Division were at their zenith in the eighties, and it was a meat market scene which captivated the interests of people nationwide!! "About Last Night" was a very well made film! Zwick's directing efforts in this movie are very impressive!! David Mammet is known for plays turned movies which are set in Chicago locations. In addition to "About Last Night", "Glengarry Glen Ross" is another Mammet play which became a successful motion picture!! I liked the movie "About Last Night"!! Division St is a mere shell of what it was in the 1980's, I was so much younger then, and I was totally into the thick of it!! Division St has lost a lot of it's socially acceptable finesse over the years!! Not that people do not drink anymore, that is not it!! Right now, I am writing this review with a really bad hangover!! If you get the chance to see this film please do so!! You will enjoy it very much!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>About Last Night is a romantic dramedy film that was directed by Edward Zwick.It features Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as Chicago yuppies who enter a committed relationship for the first time.The cast also includes Elizabeth Perkins and James Belushi as friends of the couple. The film is based on the 1974 David Mamet play Sexual Perversity in Chicago. Danny and Bernie are two single men who live in Chicago. When Danny meets Debbie at a bar in the Chicago Gold Coast, the two start a relationship from a one-night stand. The film follows the couple for the first year of their relationship: their meeting after a softball game, her moving in with him, mutual friction at Thanksgiving, their breakup on New Year's Eve, his apology and declaration of love on St. Patrick's Day, and their reconciliation at a softball game.In the end,the experience problems with commitment after their first time sleeping together. They find that the influence of their friends hinders them and eventually decide that they have nothing in common.The movie was definitely engaging as Demi Moore and Rob Lowe have great chemistry and provided great performances as the couple with the former avoiding to get used in a relationship and the latter now wanting to get serious in a relationship.Added to that,it was a film that tackles relationships in real life and with real people.There was nothing pretentious about it especially when exploring the positive and the negative aspects of romance.Overall,it remains a relevant movie about love after many years of its theatrical release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling in love isn't as easy as it seems</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a movie about love at first sight and living happily ever after. Sure, the two main characters, Danny and Debbie, fall for each other very quickly. But while they may think they're in love it becomes apparent they have very little grasp of what being in love actually means. If they want their happily ever afters they're going to have to work for them. Is it even worth the effort? Their respective best friends certainly don't seem to think so, doing everything they can to sabotage the relationship. And there are times Danny and Debbie do a fine job of sabotaging things themselves. This is an honest look at an evolving relationship, so many ups and downs. Love is great. But love can cause a lot of pain too.The movie benefits from excellent performances from Rob Lowe and Demi Moore as the two young would-be lovers. Lowe strikes the right tone as a guy who, egged on by his friend, thinks he may just be too cool to fall in love. Danny doesn't want to open himself up, make himself vulnerable. He won't admit that finding Debbie is the best thing that ever happened to him, maybe until it's too late. Don't know what you got till it's gone? Meanwhile Moore has perhaps never been better than she was here. She's absolutely charming when she needs to be and radiant throughout. But when the relationship sours, when the pain and the hurt are too much to bear, Moore captures that brilliantly as well. Your heart aches for her.With Lowe and Moore hitting all the right notes the movie was never going to fail. But there is the sense it could have been a little bit better than it was. As Danny and Debbie draw closer the movie slows down some. The possibility of their being in love was exciting but once they actually were in love, or at least thought they were, things get bogged down a bit. The supporting players don't help much. Playing Danny's friend Bernie is James Belushi. He provides most of the movie's humor, never more so than in the very opening scene which with its crackling, hilarious dialogue may be the best moment the movie has. But as Bernie tries to drive a wedge in the Danny-Debbie relationship he becomes too much of a boor for the movie's good, entirely unsympathetic. Meanwhile Elizabeth Perkins plays Debbie's friend Joan, the iciest of ice queens. It's impossible to warm up to this man-hater. Not the fault of the performance from Perkins, this character was simply written to be too obnoxious to bear. The pressure from their friends causes problems between Danny and Debbie but the relationship was built on a flimsy foundation to begin with. A one-night stand that too quickly became so much more. They weren't looking for love, found it anyway, and didn't know what to do with it. This is a movie which certainly has its flaws but it has notable charms as well. It's worth spending two hours to see if these young lovers want to spend their lives together.</fullReview>

However, Danny's best-friend "Bernie Litgo" (James Belushi) and Debbie's best-friend "Joan" (Elizabeth Perkins) don't like the new relationship because it directly impacts their personal life. So, both of them try to sabotage it on various occasions. Anyway, rather than detail the entire story and possibly spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it I will just say that this was a well-written romantic comedy which I thought was highly entertaining. In my opinion, while Rob Lowe's performance was excellent and Demi Moore was certainly cute, it was James Belushi who stole the show as the big lout who did his best to mentor Danny in the ways of the world. Quite hilarious. Having said that I should also probably mention that there is some sex, nudity and graphic language throughout and discretion is highly advised. Be that as it may, I liked this movie and I rate it as definitely above average.</fullReview>

It explores all the ups and downs of trying to make a relationship work as well as all the doubts and worries if this is the right person etc. James Belushi and Elizabeth McGovern play the role of best friend to Lowe's Danny and Moore's Debbie magnificently. They banter back and forth between each other but you can tell there is a chemistry there between them as well, perhaps even more so than with Danny and Debbie. The movie features Rob Lowe and Demi Moore at their most attractiveness too. They are both very easy on the eyes in this film but yet they still seem down to earth. It is definitely a movie for adults though. It has one of the best nude/sex scenes in my opinion with Demi Moore before her implants. Overall, About Last Night is a perfect date movie for grown ups.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About Last Night...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Relationships are complicated, aren't they? Two people meet, almost immediate attraction, passionate sex, moving in together, dealing with each other's differences, soon tiring of the little annoyances which creep up(like tampons missing the garbage can, friends who want their single friends back, the holiday dinners, not communicating their true feelings, etc.) and finding their lives especially difficult outside the love affair. Rob Lowe and Demi Moore were hot young stars on the rise and ABOUT LAST NIGHT? was a more mature movie dealing with the things I mentioned as they portray a couple who try to make a relationship work and find that doing so demands sacrifices and change. Lowe was a handsome swinger whose boozing, trash-talking slob buddy, Litko(James Belushi, stealing his scenes) wishes would return to him once he "dedicates himself" to Moore. Elizabeth Perkins(also wonderful)is Moore's moody schoolteacher gal pal Joan. Joan wishes Moore's Debbie would forget about Lowe's Danny for she believes he's no good for her. Joan also doesn't appreciate the fact that Debbie begins spending so much time with Danny. It's hard when you are a promising, rising salesman(of toilet paper and restaurant supplies)and have the kind of looks that cause women to swoon, but dedicate yourself to one woman who definitely desires commitment. Even more difficult is that Danny hates his job because his nagging, bitching boss(George DiCenzo) expects him to cut off a client..this client Danny is quite friendly with who owns a diner that isn't doing that well financially, needing customers, the place is certainly a fixer-upper in need of sprucing up. Debbie attempts to encourage Danny to quit and open his own restaurant, but fear of such an undertaking stalls such a promising venture. The film follows the strains and tension which soon surface and doom Danny and Debbie's possible happiness, but there's always hope when two people truly love each other. It takes acknowledging that love, coming to terms with the fact that you belong together, and getting over the anger and disappointment you feel about the break-up. Eventually Danny tests the waters and finds the supposed "many fishes in the sea" isn't quite working out as he'd have expected, his feelings for Debbie ever-present and lingering. Debbie, on the other hand, was 100% dedicated to Danny feeling scorned and hurt when he brought up the two splitting up. The dialogue and subject matter is provocative and graphic in regards to detailing the sexual dynamics of Lowe and Moore, pretty surprising that such a film is directed by Ed Zwick. I thought Lowe was quite good in this actually(like a lot of young adults, he doesn't quite know what he wants out of life, his place in the world, and isn't too indecent a man, although his views on women before Moore's coming into his life would probably be considered off-putting) , and Moore doesn't overact or under-act which is nice(her character wants her man to open up and respond to her, to be there for her, to participate, to communicate, etc).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About last night 2.0</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I heard that this movie was going to be remade this year (2011)... This is yet another example that Hollywood has become bereft of original thoughts. About last night really only works as a period piece of the 1980's (I know it was adapted from a play in the 1970's but the decades weren't that different). If you put to modern a spin on it, it'll lose all it meaning and wind up a parody of itself. There are simply no modern taboo's left to explore in the film industry (unless we start getting into the realm of the illegal). I can't imagine a 2011 version of this story where we put a Snookie like character in for Debbie and another young, empty headed Hollywood body in for Danny. They won't be believable, they won't be likable and the movie will fall on it's face.About last night is a great movie on many levels... It's nostalgic, it's sentimental, it's pretty funny and relatively realistic (especially in terms of the psychology of it's characters). It drags you through the mud but lets you feel clean at the end. Does it use clichéd 1980's sequences? Yes it does! You just have to wallow in them a little.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Quite an enjoyable film which plays like a teen love story, only a few years on. Rob Lowe and Demi Moore are a couple who find making love easy, but commitment very difficult indeed."About Last Night..." is a movie about making relationships last, and it is at times quite accurate. The comedy, which is for the most part supplied by sex crazed James Belushi and sour Elizabeth Perkins, is good but the pair are a little predictable.The plot is unashamedly full of sex, and the running time's a tad bit long, but otherwise this movie is good fun.

		<fullReview>Most popular films aren't about people like us; regular people and what really happens when we find love. This film is more of an art film because it shows us ourselves without the filter of fantastic characters or circumstance. Perhaps the move towards reality shows is occurring while Hollywood continues to avoid films that are too real. This film scores big on what confronts young love but relies on no fantasy element to sugar-coat it. It doesn't become the eye candy movie with only visual stimulation and people we don't see in our lives. It has dramatic elements common to our own experience. The film places ordinary people in the crucible from which we must all emerge.</fullReview>

Anyone who has ever dated a guy who you felt was always keeping his options open for something better, or if you ever had meddlesome friends try to sabotage your relationship, you need to see this movie. I could actually feel exactly what Demi Moore's character felt on New Year's Eve when Rob Lowe told her "I don't...love you." Heartbreaking! And it was so touching when they showed the montage of scenes after they broke up, with Demi crying with her head in Elizabeth Perkins' lap. Great movie, really makes you think.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my all time favourite movies. A superb adaptation of the stage play and in my opinion the most brutally honest love story ever made. The performances are exceptional by all the actors both lead and supporting and Demi Moore is an outstanding actor who is criminally underrated. It's a real slice of life drama which has you caught up in a whirlwind of emotions (including cringing with embarrassment when you realise that you've done/said many of those things!) A must see for anyone embarking on a new relationship, especially if your wearing rose tinted glasses! It's not your typical rom-com, for a start it has a very bittersweet sentiment. Does it have a happy ending???? Anyone who hasn't seen it, watch it now. You won't be disappointed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sexual Stupidity in Chicago</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, based on Mamet's _Sexual Perversity in Chicago_, fails to capture the dramatic intensity and profound character study of the original one-act play. Lowe, as usual, appears as a slimy, womanizing bachelor--can we say "typecast?" Moore's acting is placid and contrived. While the chemistry between Moore and Lowe is lukewarm, they fail to portray the complexities of their relationship, which Mamet's original drama demands. They just appear to be doing what "comes naturally" without any awareness of what exactly the story is about, an examination of sexual mores (related to the yuppie sub-culture, in particular) in the late '70s and early '80s.Belushi and Perkins turn in well-acted supporting performances, but they can't make up for Lowe's and Moore's routine schtick. They do add a zest to the film with their unabashedly self-righteous comments to their friends. Clearly, the "Battle of the Sexes" is one aspect of this film that works.I gave this film 6 out of 10 stars. While the script was flawed, it did provide some truly funny moments. Good supporting performances by Belushi and Perkins can't salvage the lackluster acting by the two main performers, Lowe and Moore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Attractive young couple in Chicago (Rob Lowe and Demi Moore) try living together, but work pressures and interference from their non-mutual friends puts a strain on their relationship. Watered down screen-adaptation of David Mamet's much racier play "Sexual Perversity in Chicago" becomes rather standard battle of the sexes, with not two but four willful characters all getting in their licks. As the secondary couple, James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins are nearly intolerable (Perkins seems to be playing a lesbian who still chases men, yet her domineering force over Demi Moore is never acknowledged or ironed out). Lowe is once again uncomfortable and self-conscious on the screen (always aware of the camera and yet fidgety in his own body, he has to force himself to act "natural"). The picture is well-made, yet the material seems to have been deprogrammed--anything truly provocative has been removed. Moore has some good scenes, and her scratchy voice and direct manner are attractive, but these characters keep going back and forth over the same old issues and the screenwriters take their sweet time bringing them (and us) to the inevitable conclusion. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Premise, Poorly Executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie considers what life is like when 2 people attempt to build a relationship with sex as its foundation. The question asked of the viewer is `What would a relationship be like if the only connection the couple makes is sexual?' The answer is quite obvious.** Possible Minor Spoilers ***Each main character is consumed by sex. One-night stand type sex or sex without meaning. This is all well and good but problems arise when 2 of the characters mistakenly try to have a real relationship based on their like appetites for sex. Demi Moore and Rob Lowe quickly learn workable relationships are much, much more than great sex. Most people, including myself, at one time or another think sex is the single most important part of a relationship. This thinking could not be further from the truth as this movie tries to illustrate.Unfortunately the movie is not real effective. Nor is it very funny. All 4 characters are complete sluts and seem to lack any type of intelligence. James Belushi is funny but Demi's friend, Elizabeth Perkins, is simply annoying until the very end of the movie. Let's face it, Rob Lowe is not a great actor and it shows. Demi, with her utter beauty and sexy voice, is extremely sensual and naked in the movie. She makes the entire film worth watching in my estimation. The ending is decent but the story is told in a choppy way. The scenes do not flow together very well. The characters, Lowe and Demi, do seem to learn something thru their experience but overall they are both shallow people.Overall this film is watchable and somewhat enjoyable but does not do a good job developing the character's thoughts and emotions. Plus, this comedy is simply not very funny other than a few stories and lines by Belushi. This film is more `eye candy' than a true portrayal of a couple's trials. 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

I had not seen the movie yet and after I did I tried to get there as often as I could to see all the great locations the movie was shot in. It seemed like this movie was my life story as well as many other's. The best friend trying hard to break you and the new girlfriend up and her best friend who is a total bitch. The soundtrack is great with John Waite from The Babys doing "If Anybody Had A Heart" at the final scene at the softball fields. The only way it could have been any better would have had it end like this...Belushi and Perkins are at the bar and he wants to buy everyone in the place a drink...it's just him and her...they look at each other like they might hook up. They see each other at the ball fields and they look at each other and he should have said, "Ya know....about last night....? That would have been a great way to end the movie. Then there could have been About Last Night II!</fullReview>

About Last Night. . . is a character study of people who want sex but are too selfish to actually have real relationships. The movie shows how the characters are conditioned by their environment to act so self-centered. The director probably did not intend for it to be a commentary on self-centeredness in relationships, but because the setting happens to be middle America in the mid-1980s it just turned out that way. There are also a few memorably hilarious lines and some nifty 1980s music if you are in to that sort of thing.</fullReview>

On stage this was a howl, a rage against the inevitable- fallingin love. On film, it's a little gooey and sweet, not much bite there,but a few interesting lines (usually all taken from Mamets play) thathit home about the difficulty of sacrificing 'self' to become a'couple'. Lowe and Moore are pretty, but it's the surroundingcharacters that actually act and are interesting, and if you look hardyou can see some good actors in small roles, such as Megan Mullaly (Willand Grace) Catherine Keener (Walking and Talking) and Ray Wohl(Arli$$). This is definitely a film of and for it's time, although notquite as painfully dated as St. Elmos Fire, you'll still laugh at someof the hair styles and fashions and music. The director went on tocreate "thirtysomething", which tells you right there that he didn'thave much in common with David Mamet. A curiosity, this film. .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>moving in together? you HAVE to see this movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 12. And I actually liked it. Being in love, having a hot girlfriend, and having someone to run around the city with looked so great. But then when I actually entered a relationship years later, this film spoke so much more to me on new levels. Viewing it as a pre-teen and then as an adult was one of the more odd cinematic experiences of my life. Movies that you grow up with generally don't change the way you look at them when you're older. But this one did. I've always called it the best relationship movie I've ever seen, but really, it's the only one. It explores the meeting, the break-up, the make-up, the official break-up, then the possible second chances of love. The euphoria of that first eye-contact, falling in love, and sex. Lots of sex. Which the film does in reverse. The two lead characters sleep together about six hours after meeting, then try to start a relationship. Even though their approach is backward, the film still tells the very accurate account of moving in, adjusting, changes, and the best friends who get forgotten in the process. This film is often times called a romantic-comedy, which is a real misnomer. It's more of a romantic-drama, with bits of comedy in it. The stars, Lowe and Moore, play all their scenes serious, while Belushi and Perkins, the scorned friends, insult and smugly comment on the happenings. Moore is very good, the sensitive girlfriend who is always trying to please Lowe. His performance is a little more uneven, at times he's on-target with some lines, other times he seems kind of stiff. Perkins is a tough analysis, because she portrays her character so perfectly, yet it's such an unlikeable character. You get sick of her fast, but can't take your ears off her. Oddly enough, I have to say the real star may be Belushi. His disgusting opinions and essays on sex and women get you rolling because sometimes he's right, and sometimes because he's out of his mind. I think he should've been nommed for an Academy Award. But all in all, this movie is so true to what love is like, I highly reccomend it to anyone venturing into getting serious with someone. You'll look at it in a totally different way, and though almost twenty years old, it hasn't aged a bit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why Would Anyone Make This Movie About These People?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie should be required viewing for all students of film making. It proves one thing beyond a shadow of a doubt. If you make a movie about two incredibly boring people, you're going to end up with an incredibly boring movie. Somehow this didn't occur to those who chose to inflict this turkey on the viewing public.The movie revolves around the ups and downs in the romantic relationship between Danny (Rob Lowe) and Debbie (Demi Moore). Demi spends a lot of her time crying and looking wounded. So does Lowe, except that he also does a fine job of looking bored while he's making this dud. (At least he's honest!) James Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins seem to have been added to the cast to provide some comedy relief. That would have been welcome, except that neither one of them was very funny. Their performances as the best friends of Danny and Debbie who get consumed by jealousy starts to grate after about 15 minutes. However, in fairness, it was them who kept me watching. Two or three times there were hints that these two polar opposite characters might have a romance of their own beginning to bud, and I really wanted to see if it happened. That was the only thing that raised this movie from a 2 to a 4. Watching Demi and Rob was about as exciting as watching ice cubes melt.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This could fall under the category of spoiler as I do explain some scenes, But there's plenty I leave open so that you can watch the movie and know that you'll be surprised by most of it. I did hint at the ending of the movie, But still you have to see it as it's rather sentimental as well.One of the best movies I've seen. Although I'm not a big Rob Lowe fan, He plays a part in this movie that seems very "him". Whereas Demi shows herself as a great actress in this movie. She plays Debbie, A girl who tries to fall in love with a guy after a one night stand. But the best scenes involve Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins. They are the quintessential "pig" and "man hater". Belushi's scenes with Lowe and Perkins are classics. Belushi telling Lowe the best thing that could happen to him would be an "industrial accident" and Belushi telling Perkins that if she didn't have a "certain part of her anatomy between her legs (Sorry, He used the very slang term, So I had to clean it up)" that there would be a bounty on her head are 2 of the funniest lines I've heard in a movie. There is nudity a plenty in the movie of Demi (Before implants) and it is actually almost a "chick flick" in that after the first few times of sex, They actually start making love and fall in love with each other. But unfortunately for Danny, He doesn't realize that he loves Debbie until it's too late, At least till the end of the movie. There is also a great chemistry between Debbie and Joan (Perkins), Especially when Debbie goes off on Joan about her "psychobabble" of hating men. And Joan is funny as a K teacher trying to explain sex to her students. I have seen this movie over 100 times and would recommend it to anyone, And I do whenever I get a chance. So go ahead an watch it.</fullReview>

Immensely quotable, snappy, sophisticated, sarcastic use of language ("So did you sleep with him? No, Dan, we were bowling partners," "The combination hair flip with a giggle...there's a 3.2 degree of difficulty here; let's see if she can pull it off," "And you are a psychopathic, schizophrenic social misfit who is clearly in the middle of a very deep homosexual panic"). The main characters are convincing in their struggles--to love and be loved, you have to risk emotional torture and this film has both. Hers is stinging and sharp when he clumsily ends their relationship, and his is wallowing and then piercing--especially the scene in the teeming rain outside the bar. The chemistry between the actors is so real and the emotions so raw that even now, more than 15 years after I first saw this film in the theater, I cry watching these scenes.</fullReview>

Rob Lowe and Demi are not without their charms, but you really felt they were acting, it did not feel real. Elizabeth Perkins was somewhat realistic, though not likable. The best was Jim Belushi and his abrasive ways, he really stood out. During the kisses you did feel something happening on screen, the kisses were romantic.

		<shortDescription>Chicago the true star of this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Caution: A spoiler or two;The first time I saw About Last Night, I was 20 years old and had just broken up with the first woman with whom I cohabitated. Many of the same things happened in that relationship as in the movie --- from the one night stand (that should have remained as one night), to the playing hard-to-get, to the sleepovers, to the offer of a "drawer" and inevitable moving in together. My friendship with my long time school buddy (and sudden ex-roommate) also became strained over the new love interest, and it contributed in part to the friction that would eventually end the failed experiment. Unlike the movie, however, I did not have regrets about ending the relationship --- sorry --- I didn't spy on her from outside a bar in the pouring rain, and the one and only time I saw her a year later, I couldn't get away fast enough.Still, many of the scenes in About Last Night felt like they were plucked right out of my own experience --- some of the feelings portrayed by Rob Lowe's Danny felt very real to me, and some of Debbie's (Demi Moore) behaviours seemed hauntingly familiar. The two very polar perspectives on what "living together" should mean are right on the money, as are some other ironic observations --- "see what happens when you say / don't say 'I love you'?"The real star of this movie, however, was the city of Chicago, and having had an opportunity to visit the city 13 years later, I visited many of the shooting locations --- from Mother's bar (which actually was shot downstairs, not on the main floor as it appears) to the very ball diamond in the SE corner of Grant Park. Unfortunately never got a chance to see Wrigley Field (the Cubs were on the road). Beautiful city.Anyway, I've seen this movie about a dozen times and never get tired of it. The dialogue between Jim Belushi and Elizabeth Perkins still kills me --- especially their encounter at Mother's at closing time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when it originally came out 15 years ago. At the time, I was barely out of high school. Rob Lowe was DEFINATELY the "Freddie Prinze Jr/Ryan Phillipe" stud of the eighties; and I was totally HOT HOT HOT for him. When you watch this film, you can see why!! It's also nice to see that he still looks this good today!! "About Last Night" attempts to be a love story and an erotic film both at the same time. It works as both, however, it works much better as an erotic film. How often do we see this kind of love story played out?! If you watch closely, it is clear that the "visual" is the most important aspect of this movie(Predominantly for women); More attention is given to Rob Lowe's body than to Demi Moore's. Rob Lowe clearly has a very beautiful body; the producers and directors utilized it quite well in a number of different scenes. The scene where Demi Moore walks by a "naked" Rob Lowe sleeping on the floor is clearly meant to show off Rob's body. Though he is supposed to be "just sleeping", you see that when he sleeps, he is clearly positioned to show off his body in the most "erotic" way possible. There are also plenty of other "Rob" nude scenes that are equally as sexy. This film is enjoyable all the way around; fine performances are given by both the actors and supporting actors. It works well as a romance and a comedy, but clearly it works best as an erotic film. I saw it again, on video tape, for about the tenth time!! I think I could watch it again and again and again. Go Rob!!!!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in the theater in 1986. I recall seeing an interview with Rob Lowe and Demi Moore in which they said they were glad to be playing characters who were their own age, after giving yeoman service to the early-eighties teen-romp genre. Perhaps after the blithering wreck that was "St. Elmo's Fire," they thought any script would be an improvement. Well, they were almost right. Not quite, though.My real problem with the characters in this movie is that all of them are unlikeable. Rob Lowe and Demi Moore do the typical Me Generation routine of Meet Cute, Sleep Together Right Away, Attempt To Cobble Meaningful Relationship Only After Ascertaining Sexual Compatibility. As an earlier reviewer noted, the majority of people who've tried this in real life have learned the hard way that you can't start in the middle if you want a happy ending.Jim Belushi has some amusing lines as Rob Lowe's blustery legend-in-his-own-mind buddy, but his "would you look at the nips on that one" attitude toward women is too offensive to redeem him otherwise. Elizabeth Perkins' adversarial attitude toward men makes it not too believable that she'd succeed in dragging a new trick home every weekend, unless we assume that she visited a veterinarian every Friday to have her fangs milked first.I haven't seen the stage play on which this movie was based, but I'd be interested to. I wonder whether the premise here is true to the playwright's original vision?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>who wouldn't want to have Belushis humor and right-on-target-lines during the day and someone like Demi Moore during the night ? Skip Rob Lowe, this film is good with him in it but could have been GREAT without.The film does stand the test of time mainly because of Belushis excellent timing and mimic. He knows what to do, when to do it AND how.The same goes for Elizabeth Perkins who delivers, ( especially in the scenes with Belushi ), a feeling that she truly IS Joan and doesn't have to act her rage against the male race.For the lovers of Belushi humor : SEE THIS ONE !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Flick Worth Watching Over and Over Again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently got this movie on DVD and it was just like watching it for the first time. I'm 31 now going on 32 so the relationship part was quite interesting (considering I've been quite UNsuccessful in that department).Demi Moore has never been prettier (and is still incredible after all these years). Gosh, Dan was an idiot to ask Debbie to leave.You can't go wrong with this flick. Buy it today!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sex is easy, it's love thats the hard part.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>All around not a totally bad movie. It could have had less nudity. Because of all the nudity, a story and character development was looked the other way. I would have called this the original Sex And The City. The story evolves around Danny(Rob Lowe) who does not want to get serious, and Debbie who wants really to find true love. The two meet at a Chicago bar, and instantly hit it off. She decides to move in with him. But they both soon discover that sex is easy, but it's love thats the hard part. A pretty good 80's movie. The movie tried to tackle the issues of sex and love. It's well acted by everyone. But the story gave up on itself before it ever got started. Elizabeth Perkins is good has Moore's escentric Joan. And Jim Belushi is pretty good has Lowe's goofy but great friend Bernie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About a bad movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is bad. One of the worst romantic comedies i have seen lately. The plot is simple - a guy and a girl fall in love, move in together, start fighting, try to save their relationship. About Last Night doesn't bring anything new to the genre. Same predictable so-called comedy - believe me, there is nothing in this movie that comes even close to the word "funny", same stupid lines, and same bad acting. There are many scenes that just don't seem real. Many moments in which Zwick wants to get somewhere with the plot and just doesn't know how to do that. So come up some really bad scenes, that just don't work at all. And then there's the acting. Rob Lowe is not a great actor at all. His role is simple and still he doesn't seem believeble at all. And Demi Moore... she's alright throughout most of the film. Except when she cries and really tries to express some feelings. In those moments she is really bad.All in all, this movie doesn't bring anything new. It's just a waste of two hours. Vote: 3 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>About this movie....stinker.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'About Last Night' is the story of a guy and girl who fall in and out of love, repeatedly mixed in with about an hour of raunchy, eye-crossing sex. I think the long-lasting appeal of this movie was soft porn and a popular 80s cast (Demi Moore and Rob Lowe in the leads).However, the love story would have been more sincere and convincing had Lowe's character not behaved like a prepubescent boy throughout the film. Demi's character actually seemed like she was looking for true love, while he just seemed to be an unsure floater.Resist the temptation to see it purely for the stars, you've been warned about what you're getting yourself into.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie should be seen just to see Rob Lowe naked. Well, at least the backside of him naked. Enjoy! Demi also has many nude shots. However, her breasts are much bigger in Striptease. Coincidence? I think not. No full-frontal shots though. Sorry guys.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Contains SpoilersIntroductionThe movie `About Last Night' opens with Bernie (Belushi) telling Dan (Lowe) about a recent sexual conquest that quickly spins off into the ridiculous. This is where the movie tries to establish these two as `regular guys.' They do regular guy things like play softball, hang out at the local bar, get drunk, boast about their sexual achievements, and hustle bar lurking sluts. These wantons include Debbie (pre-boob job Demi Moore) and Joan (Elizabeth Perkins), her roommate. With this lovely setting the movie insinuates many concepts that are described in chapters 8, 9 and 10 of the text book Looking Out Looking In. There are literally hundreds of concepts illustrated in this movie. Some aspects that will be exposed are: reciprocal attraction, initiating and intensifying relationships, personal disclosure and expressed struggle. While I will agree with Brenda that this is not perhaps the best movie in the world, it is an excellent example of relationships and communication.Reciprocal AttractionOne of the first topics I noticed from the film was reciprocal attraction. Debbie is having an affair with her boss, but Danny is just so cute that she sleeps with him on the first date. Their date consisted of, `Hi, hello' and then sex. On their second so-called `date' Debbie relented her strong moral values and screwed him again, again and again. The text Looking Out Looking In says that, `We like people who like us-usually. The power of reciprocal attraction is especially strong in the early stages of a relationship. At that time we are attracted to people who we believe are attracted to us' (332). At this point their relationship is strong because of their physical attraction for one another. Each of them lusted for the other's body and had no real interest in the others personality or character.InitiatingBefore all this copulation began, Debbie and Danny's initiating moment started the night they first met at the bar. The book explains, `the goals in the first stage [of initiating] are to show that you are interested in making contact and to show that you are the kind of person worth talking to' (345). Both Debbie and Dan were very much interested in each other when they first spoke. Their eyes were feast fully fixated on each other and both had a different agenda than just chatting. The text goes on to say that `communication during this initiating stage is usually brief and generally follows conventional formulas' (345). Sex, while highly unconventional, was Debbie's way of saying, `I'm interested in you and I want to start a relationship.'IntensifyingAfter initiating, and a few other stages, comes intensifying. This is the stage where Dan and Debbie begin to see themselves as `we.' Debbie has since left her roommate and moved in with Dan. There is a moment when tensions are high and Debbie exclaims, `Do you want me out?' Dan replies, `Yes!' Debbie then says, `Fine I'll leave.' Dan doesn't like the idea that she is essentially leaving him so he protests, `You can't leave, this is our place.' This conflict helps them realize that they are not individuals anymore, only a couple. Other intensifying actions that take place are physical caresses, Debbie striving to stay beautiful for Dan and doing favors for each other.Personal DisclosureAnother matter that the movie successfully conveyed was personal disclosure. The definition of self-disclosure is, `the process of deliberately revealing information about oneself that is significant and that would not normally be known by others' (359). Disclosure takes place when Debbie tells Dan some secrets that only women know. In return Debbie wants to know something about him. Dan tells her that he wants to open his own restaurant but its too expensive and he needs a license.Expressed StruggleIn the book this is noted as `showing displeasure with somebody without saying a word' (431). A conflict can exist only when both parties are aware of a disagreement. For instance, after they break up and Dan tries trolling the bars for women, he decides he wants Debbie back. She rebuffs him, saying, `We had nothing. We had good sex.' She's right on. Their struggle is finally out in the open and now Dan is aware of the conflict and how Debbie views it. Further along Debbie highlights the expressed struggle by her bitterness when ignoring Dan and all his attempts to re-establish a relationship. ConclusionThis movie is typical of the late 1980's, exposes many of the principles in the text. From Joan bringing home a string of guys in an attempt to out-slut her roomie to Debbie's sleazy screw scenes in the tub, one often wonders the value of such a film. This film has its finger on the pulse of Hollywood's moral code and it's pressing hard, very hard. The girls are sluts, the guys are whores, and everybody sleeps with everybody. In fact, you're not really dating unless you're screwing. But, hey, it's not totally exclusive sex! Debbie can nail her married boss and it's considered `O.K.' But when one of Joan's solicitants turns out to be married (unbeknownst to her), he's committed the unforgivable sin. Along with these facts are some great examples of personal relationships and the stages they go through.</fullReview>
