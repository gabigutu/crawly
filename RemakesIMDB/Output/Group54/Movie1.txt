		<fullReview>Why, oh, why do they try and remake Buster Keaton's movies, he was such a master of his craft that it is near impossible to make anything near as good as his original movies. Saying that, even if I hadn't seen 'Seven Chances' before seeing this I'd still have the same opinion, Chris O'Donnell had the potential to be a star, but, he has the inability to know a good script and this is a classic example. None of the characters are particularly endearing, Arte Lange is plain annoying and seeing Ed Asner and Hal Holbrooke was saddening. Rene Zellwegger is as usual very good, which is about the only positive thing in this sorry excuse of a movie. Major plothole, how come all the brides turn up at the church in full, perfectly fitting bridal regalia on only a few hours notice? Are we supposed to believe that all women have a perfect wedding outfit in their wardrobe 'just in case'? And amazingly, the wedding dress found for Anne fits like a dream, an amazing coincidence or what!! At least in Keaton's version the 'brides' are in their normal clothing with just cobbled together veils to distinguish them as brides, far more convincing.My advice, hunt down a copy of the original 'Seven Chances', there is no comparison. Note to reviewer Matt Doolittle, BusterKeaton was an amazing man, but, even he couldn't direct a film 33 years after his death.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGH: The Bachelor is a sweet, rather dull romantic comedy starring Rennee Zelweger and Chris O'Donnell. It's a movie that almost seems to promise hilarity yet strangely the movie isn't that funny. In fact it's not that interesting either though certainly not unwatchable. Yet for some reason, even though this movie contains two warm likable charismatic leads, the movie never picks up steam.I think there were a few things that I did not like here, one being the playing out of a very funny premise. But the movie, even though it's not that long, gets rather irritating. The whole thing centers on O'Donnell proposing to various women and while it was fun at first, none of the women are in their scenes long enough to make a strong comedic impression and Zelwegger herself, while coming across as charming and sweet as always, is somewhat underused. Her main point seems to be moaning about her problems with Jimmy. In the meantime, the viewer can't make up their mind whether Jimmy is a nice guy or a jerk, mainly because he keeps switching back and forth and we never get to see him one aspect of his personality for to long.The movie becomes a bit tedious as well as Jimmy races around in search of new ex girlfriends to propose to so he can get his inheritance. It should be laugh out loud funny but isn't. I was moderately interested in how it turned out but also wanted it to end. It was a given that these two would wind up together anyway.The movie didn't seem to contain enough truly hilarious material and with a premise such as this, it should have, because this is a great situation on which to build a romantic comedy. I thought there would be unforgettable one liners and I'd be falling out of my seat....did not happen at all. However with this cast, particularly Zelwegger I'd never call it bad, just strongly lacking in some areas, particularly the comedic.And then we come to the famous scene with the hundreds(or thousands?) of Brides chasing Jimmy. Now if any scene had the potential to be UTTERLY HILARIOUS it was that one. But it doesn't happen. The brides aren't funny, their annoying, and by that time one just wants them to stop chasing the groom so he can marry Renee Zelwegger and the movie can end. It's another scene that should be hysterical but just fell flat.In closing, this is watchable but a bit disappointing and not very funny though the end is very romantic and big fans of Zelwegger may want to check it out, that was my main reason for doing so. My rating is 5 of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sight of an army of brides in white chasing a man down the streets is a very unusual and funny one. It was especially funny the first time around, with Buster Keaton. In "Seven Chances" (1925) old stone face played a man who had been left an inheritance of a large sum of money ($7 million)under the condition that he get married before his next birthday...which happens to be the following day. His efforts to find a willing bride results in ridicule, a car wreck, etc. He finally puts an ad in the paper, telling the circumstances, and asking for the applying bride to meet him at the church. At least a thousand women ranging from fat, small, young, old, beautiful, downright misshapen arrive at the church. Well, the same exact thing happens in this movie "The Bachelor" (though inflation has turned $7 Million into $100 million), only I gotta say the Keaton version is still the original and unsurpassed (and unsurpassable) masterpiece. I actually couldn't believe they named it "The Bachelor", it's a very boring title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SOME MINOR SPOILERS (REGARDING THE PLOT - NOT WHAT HAPPENS)!"The Bachelor"Chris O'Donnell stars with Renee Zellweger in the 1999 remake `The Bachelor,' a film about `the true meaning of love.' Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) is your average 29-year-old bachelor: he doesn't want to let the good times come to a stop. But after he is pushed by friends to propose to his girlfriend Anne (Zellweger), he does so, and accidentally says some regrettable things in the proposal line (`You win!').After a fuming Anne refuses to respond to any of Jimmie's calls in the days to come, Jimmie comes to a realization that the relationship is over. And then it happens. His grandfather passes away, leaving 100 million dollars to Jimmie. What's the catch, you ask? He must find a wife in twenty-seven hours to get the money.And so, the game is on, as Jimmie proposes to all his old girlfriends, including Ilana (Mariah Carey), Daphne (Jennifer Esposito), Buckley (Brooke Shields), but before all them, a re-proposal to an ever-softened Anne, who realizes before saying `Yes' that Jimmie is not ready to get married.`The Bachelor' is a remake of `Personal,' `How a French Nobleman Got a Wife Through the 'New York Herald' Personal Columns,' `Meet Me at the Fountain,' and `Seven Chances,' all of which I have not seen. Therefore, I have nothing to base my review on. Also, therefore, I enjoyed this film. It may be a bit odd at times, especially the end, but overall it is just fun. It is a good escapism film where one can sit back, relax, and forget their worries.Chris O'Donnell may not be a great actor, but he pulled off Jimmie Shannon enough to not raise any eyebrows. I found Renee Zellweger to be quite good as Anne, providing a typical `woman moment,' when she, after Jimmie makes an awful proposal to her, grabs some food and hogs down.James Cromwell is best as `The Priest,' who Jimmie carries around all day to perform a marriage on the spot. I love the deadpan expressions Cromwell carries throughout the whole film, until the end, where he finally speaks to Jimmie about love.`The Bachelor' may not have the greatest character development, and the end was a bit more than odd (too much so to call it `original'); but I still enjoyed the film. At its heart lies a refreshingly fun comedy with a disclaimer: `Please detach brains before viewing.')Dumb fun. Nothing less, nothing more.3/5 stars ?John Ulmer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are looking for a non intellectually stimulating romantic comedy, and this is on TV and you aren?t really going to pay attention, and your main alternative to watching is staring at the wall, then you are in luck. The Bachelor is the sort of movie that seems about eight years old as soon as it comes out on TV. The special effects involving various men running with horses look about this old.Basically the film revolves around the idea of bachelors as stallions powerful wild and free, the idea of true love, and functions as a frame work for ?cuteÓ romantic cliches about true love and what not. Basically the best part that lasts more than thirty seconds is the proposal with Buckley. This is not worth watching the movie for.The only non paid for reference (read non advertisement) to this movie that I have seen is something about Mariah Carey: from singing to acting, but this is the sort of ?actingÓ that a fan would not want spread around. Oh well so much for long term artistic merit or historical value of any kind.What interests me most about this movie is what bystanders thought when they saw the scenes with hundreds of wedding dress clad bride hopefuls storming the streets, running up and down the same hill over and over again until they got the perfect take, and generally walking around the city. The wedding dress scenes are very impressive and alone are almost worth watching the movie previews for. It is kind of sad that some sort of candid camera clip of bystanders staring at a bunch of actresses in wedding gowns would probably be more exciting than the movie, but that?s the way it is with The Bachelor.I didn?t think that this movie was worth my time, but some people just love happy little romantic comedies. I realize that I am not in this group, and consider this to be the worst movie that I have paid to see this year. Try as I might I will never get back my 5 dollars and the 90 minutes of my life spent on this movie. If you do watch this do something else, preferably something distracting, at the same time. Given any alternative don?t watch this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Calling this movie misogynist is a hoot!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bachelor" is a pretty good light romantic comedy. Brook Shields does indeed have the best scene in the whole flick. It's well described below, and is wonderfully funny. Rene Zellweger is both very good and very charming, as is Chris O'Donnell. It's not the sort of movie that will stay with you for much, but its pretty good fun while it's going on.There's one thing I have to say though, and the main reason I'm bothering with a comment to this flick. Those that claim this movie is unrealistic and misogynist because of it's depiction of O'Donnell's former girlfriends and the huge number of women desperate for 100 million dollars, are infected with a serious case of delusional feminist PC propaganda. I can guarantee you that if an ad (turned into a front page article) with a picture guaranteeing sharing in a $100 million fortune for marrying a guy who looks like Chris O'Donnell the next day in a big American city (and clarifying that he was deadline desperate due to the date of his grandfather's death and the will provisions, so that many would feel they had a chance and he wasn't necessarily an impossible loser), there would indeed be hordes of women lining up to do it. Many wouldn't of course. But there'd be legions willing to take their chances. One of the main things limiting the numbers in fact would be self selection. The cliché that women (especially after their early 20's) tend to be attracted to money (or its prospect), fame and or success, while men tend to be attracted to beauty, has more than a little truth to it. Of course there also has to be personal chemistry in the ordinary course, but with $100 million on the table, a great many women would take their chances. So the crowd scenes are indeed plausible (if so many managing the wedding dresses on a few hours notice isn't).What's most unrealistic is the PC "balancing" rejection this centi-millionaire gets from all but one of his former girl friends. That of course is what takes up the bulk of the movie. That is what is impossible to believe in the real world. In other words, "The Bachelor" actually leans over backwards to pretend that a far higher proportion of women wouldn't be swayed by the $100 million than is realistic. But just imagine how a more accurate balance would be criticized by the American media (not to mention academic) pundits of the moment. There are endless dismissive allusions to men being unduly or primarily interested in women's looks in today's American films -- and that that is terrible. (Why -- well, because women tend to have different priorities, and women must be right not only for themselves, but for men as well, of course.). That sort of commentary (with some basis in truth, if not in how it is characterized), often clearly intended as a put down of males, is perfectly fine under the reigning Hollywood ideology. Whereas highlighting women's special attraction (often enough) to men with power of various sorts -- money, fame, politics or sometimes physical power -- is dangerous ground indeed. Gee, I wonder why that is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I got this DVD for free, with a chicken dinner, no less. The chicken dinner was not very good but it was way better than this movie. Actually, I don't think I've ever rated a movie a 1 before, but that's only because IMDb does not allow a minus or a zero. The cast, I can't believe they would even come within a mile of this horrendous bomb, but they did, many of them, all broke, I suppose. Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook (who has one of the most appalling jobs - a father offering his 15 year old daughter as a bride to the most absolutely appalling cad), James Cromwell, Renee Zelweger and on and on. There is no script, no development of character (apart from a tiny slice of the James Cromwell bit)so many clichés it should be shown as how NOT to make a movie. I did not see it all the way to the end, my gag meter had maxed out and I needed to take a breath of fresh air. Shame on all concerned. 1 out of 10 for those 1000 unfortunate bit player brides running through San Francisco.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bachelor (1999): Dir: Gary Sinyor / Cast: Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Artie Lange, Hal Holbrook, James Cromwell: Mindless geek show That gets stupider with each passing moment. Title addresses singlehood and begins with Chris O'Donnell making two lousy proposals. He learns that he must be married by his 30th birthday or the law firm he works for will be up for grabs but if he is married then he will inherit millions pending certain conditions. He proposes to every woman within reach and getting turned down. Repetitious, predictable, boring, and irritable right up to its stupid climax where O'Donnell flees from a parade of brides. Uninspiring directing by Gary Sinyor. O'Donnell renders this his worst film since Batman and Robin only this one he is unable to conceal himself behind a mask to hide the shame. Renee Zellweger labors through flat material. She is basically the romantic lead who supposedly has a heart of gold. Artie Lange mugs scenes as O'Donnell's idiotic best friend who scopes out the possibilities in brideville. Hal Holbrook has the best lines but the role is also standard fare. James Cromwell practically sleepwalks through this garbage as a priest. Terrible waste of film with a commitment theme bypassed in favor of boring romantic clichés fit to be trampled by the bride stampede and anyone else who comes along. Score: 1 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Chris O'Donnell has a certain appeal. For me, it's his facial expressions. He is the master at portraying reactions by a mild mannered "everyman" overwhelmed by immediate circumstances.Rene Zellwegger was a mildly cute Texas girl-next-door several years before this one. In this one, set in San Francisco, her Texas accent and tomboyish outrage is not appealing.But she is supposed to be a fed-up girlfriend, so I guess she does it well.I envied the main character. How great would it be to look like him, have a guaranteed easy job for life at a pool table manufacturer in San Francisco, owned by his own family, and then inherit a bunch of money? I've met guys like that, who cruise along in "auto-pilot" with their looks, casual demeanor, and money.The sidekick character played by Artie Lang was so over-the-top obnoxious! I couldn't take it. That's his real life personality, so he wasn't acting. It was also excruciating to see classic actors like Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook play old fools in a romantic comedy for young people. It seemed degrading.I loved the imagery of single men being lassoed by a cowboy rope as symbolic of being trapped by the need to marry.I also thought the famous thousand brides scene was well done. I particularly liked the initial part of it at the church, when Chris is answering their questions about his preferences. Brooke Shields looks old and hard. Don't expect much, although she played her role well.I thought there was just the right amount of character development. You don't want too much in a RomCom. If you can stand Artie Lang,give this picture a viewing on a rainy day.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmy Shannon has a big problem. What is he to do with an inheritance of a hundred millions left to him by his grandfather if he doesn't marry by a set date? Having said the wrong things to the one woman he truly loves, has resulted in sending Anne Arden away; she wants nothing to do with him. Unknown to Anne, Jimmy is now a rich man. Will she come back to him, or will Jimmy marry someone else that will assure him of the millions he inherited?When it comes to dumb situations made by Hollywood, nothing is too much. This formula film, directed by Gary Sinyor, doesn't go anywhere. It tries to be too cute for its own good. It also has a gimmick going for itself when hundreds of women dressed in wedding gowns come to claim Jimmy for themselves.The problem is with the pairing of a bland Chris O'Donnell, with another bland actress, Renee Zellwegger, who is the epitome of "cuteness" in the movies. If the viewer accepts these two can even attract one another, then there is nothing wrong in the world. Ed Asner and Hal Holbrook, two good actors are seen in the film, but they have nothing to play with.Steve Cohen's screenplay doesn't do justice to the original material created originally for Buster Keaton, a genius in his own right, who should probably he horrified by this take on "Seven Chances".</fullReview>

In the scene on the pond, it looked like the priest was being attacked by a furry bird, and you could see where the actors were going to walk next because the mike was leading the way. It was so bad it was hilarious. Which is good because there wasn't that much else that was funny in this movie. Renee Zellweger shone far above the rest of the cast, Chris O'Donnell still needs to work on his comic timing, and the entire plot was an insult to women. Oh sure, everyone has a wedding dress just sitting around, just in case some stranger wants to marry you with little notice. Overall, a horrible experience.

		<fullReview>In order to protect a $100 million inheritance, commitment-shy bachelor Chris O'Donnell (as Jimmie Shannon) learns he must marry before he reaches his impending 30th birthday. Naturally, Mr. O'Donnell proposes to the woman he loves, beautiful blonde Renée Zellweger (as Anne Arden). But, Ms. Zellweger senses O'Donnell's heart really isn't in his "(empty your intestine) or get off the pot!" proposal. Zellweger bails, with sister Marley Shelton (as Natalie). So, O'Donnell, with pal Artie Lange (as Marco) assisting, tries to locate a marriage-minded woman, who is willing to share $100 million, and produce a baby. Any takers? Ms. Shelton is a sweet sidekick, and Brooke Shields (as Buckley) stands out among the unfortunately wasted supporting cast. Gary Sinyor's "The Bachelor" is a lesser re-make of a well-remembered Buster Keaton comedy ("Seven Chances"). No cigar and not even close.**** The Bachelor (1999) Gary Sinyor ~ Chris O'Donnell, Renee Zellweger, Marley Shelton</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Never Gets Off The Ground</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anytime you come across a comedy that's well written, superbly acted and delivered, and really funny to boot, it's a treat. Unfortunately, `The Bachelor,' directed by Gary Sinyor, is not one of them. Beginning with the voice-over narration of star Chris O'Donnell, which draws an inane analogy between young, single, American males and wild mustangs, and on through the rest of the contrivances of the lame story, right to the end, this movie is a disaster. Right out of the gate, it breaks the first rule of successful comedy: Play it straight, and they will laugh. O'Donnell reads the narrative in a lilting, sing-song manner that plays down to the audience; it implies, `This is funny, you can laugh now.' Never mind that it isn't funny, that there's nothing at all in what he's saying that makes you want to laugh. The intent, I believe, with this movie, was to make a romantic comedy; what they ended up with is the most unromantic drivel you can possibly imagine. When Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) asks his girlfriend of three years, Anne (Renee Zellweger), to marry him, she turns him down because his proposal is so crass; the worst ever made. Ironically, it comes in one of the worst scenes possibly ever filmed. Watching it takes you out of the story and almost makes you embarrassed for the actors. The next day, Jimmie's grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies and leaves him over one hundred million dollars, provided he is married by 6:05 p.m. (the time he was born) on his thirtieth birthday, which happens to be in `Twenty-seven hours and change.' Since the girl he loves has given him the gate (and rightfully so, because this guy is a real jerk) he spends the rest of the movie contacting old girlfriends, trying to find one who is willing to marry him. And for the audience, it makes for nothing more than one long, make that LONG, endurance test. O'Donnell brings nothing to the character of Jimmie; he is merely boring and tiresome. Talk about a less than sympathetic character. Renee Zellweger, whose career has been on a roll since `Jerry MaGuire' goes into a tailspin here. She does her best with what she has to work with, but it's not enough. That there's no chemistry between Anne and Jimmie is not her fault; O'Donnell is just so unappealing in this role, he couldn't make sparks with a flint. The talented supporting cast, which includes Hal Holbrook (O'Dell), Ed Asner (Gluckman), James Cromwell (Priest), Artie Lange (Marco) and Marley Shelton (Natalie) is wasted here, as well. Mariah Carey makes a brief, inauspicious appearance as one of Jimmie's former girlfriends, Ilana, in a scene better for all concerned had it wound up on the cutting room floor. The single high point (if you can call it that) amid all of this dreck, is the scene in which Brooke Shields turns in a notable performance as Buckley, another of Jimmie's girlfriends. She plays her with an aloofness that actually makes her endearing; and to find that in the midst of this film is a minor triumph. To put it as succinctly as possible, this is a bad movie. There's not a laugh to be had, and even the attempted slapstick and sight gags fall short, which proves that nothing can save a project that begins with a screenplay as acerbic and obtuse as this one. Personally, I refuse to walk out on even the worst movies, or to even turn off a video without sticking it out to the bitter end; it's like a code I live by. With this film, though, I must confess, I honestly came as close as I ever have to breaking my own rule. I rate this one 2/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE BACHELOR (1999) * Starring: Chris O'Donnell, Renée Zellweger, James Cromwell, Hal Holbrook, and Brooke Shields Directors: Buster Keaton and Gary Sinyor Running time: 101 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some sex-related dialogue)By Blake French: New Line Cinema appears to be on a losing streak this year with releasing flops and encountering narrow critical success with their productions. From "Drop Dead Gorgeous" to "Detroit Rock City," to "Body Shots" and now "The Bachelor." This movie is a romantic comedy that contains such a flat feeling and predictable plot, it is arguably the worst film released by this production company all year.  "The Bachelor" accommodates a story centering on undeveloped characters and the one dimensional situations they are placed into. The male romantic lead here is played Chris O'Donnell, and his name is Jimmie Shannon, who is supposedly in love with the usually dependable Renée Zellweger, where here is Anne. Jimmie and Anne are developed within a brief three minute opening scene where one meets the other at a coffee house when they exchange about ten words with each other. Their conversation is of pointless proportions, and has no clue of preparing any romantic chemistry or witty dialogue for us. Thus there is no believable quality between Anne and Jimmie, and this is just the opening sequence. How can a romance be effective if we don't buy the couple as a couple from the first scene?  We couldn't care less about the characters so far in the film, mainly because we lack knowledge concerning them. But soon afterward, Jimmie proposes to Anne at a fancy restaurant, where for some reason, she is offended at his verbal presentation. You see, the film is so hopeless for romantic tension, it uses the Anne character as a stubborn, unhappy brat in attempt to raise it. The film requires a delay in the engagement, due to an upcoming gimmick.  Now we have Anne angry at Jimmie, hence taking a trip to some place far away in the very near future--business matters. These events are present is to increase what little dramatic tension there. It also requires Jimmie to clean up his act before Anne leaves. Then one of his old relatives die, whose will leaves Jimmie over one hundred million dollars, if his current life applies toward his requirements: basically he has to be married within a day.  The conflict is introduced in the beginning of the second act, instead of at the start the picture. Not that it really matters where the problem is brought to our attention, because we don't care about the outcome of any relationship here. The rest of the film has Jimmie running from ex-girlfriend to ex-girlfriend desperately proposing to each so he can receive the cash promised. After a brief appearance by a popular pop singer, to an almost successful wed to a bitchy character played by Brooke Shields, Jimmie only finds himself deeper in love with the girl in his heart, Anne. I will not announce if Anne and Jimmie find true love in each other. Nor will I say if Jimmie inherits the millions left to him. The only thing we know by the trailers and posters is that somehow Jimmie will be trailed by hundreds of angry bride-to-be's down the streets of his home town. This scene is highly anticipated, and energetic, but never really funny. The way it is carried out wreaks of hilarity, but lacks slapstick quality, and believe it or not, it doesn't provoke any laughs. The supporting roles are overacted and exaggerated, but the main characters are greatly underplayed. The two romantic leads are boring, shallow, witless puppets of the plot. That is most certainly the reason why I found myself enjoying the side characters. Brooke Shields contributes an effective performance with a small side character. And James Cromwell, as a kind-hearted priest, is easily the most interesting character in the movie--the only thing is, he utters but ten lines throughout the movie. The performances from Chris O'Donnell and the Renée Zellweger come off as dreadfully dual, unimaginative and withered. O'Donnell doesn't bring any charm to his otherwise likable character, and ends up performing with conventional, utterly undertaken style. And Zellweger, who was so good in "One True Thing," has nothing to do here, beyond following the commands of the plot. What a colossal disappointment.  Another thing absent in "The Bachelor" is laughs, which are no where to be found. The way the film is portrayed is not funny at all, mainly because after the gimmick is introduced we receive more and more of the same unfunny marital. This is due to the severe lack of concern for the characters. One of the viewers I screened the production with literally fell asleep during this movie. She says that this is because it is boring. I say it is because we care so little and know so little about the characters, we feel tired and slumberous. Conclusion Statement: Half way through "The Bachelor" I still did not know the character's names. And personally, I never did care enough to learn them.

		<fullReview>Released in 1999, "The Bachelor" is a romcom starring Chris O'Donnell as a commitment-phobic bachelor in San Francisco. When his grandfather dies he stands to inherit $100 million, but with the stipulation that he must be married by the next evening, amongst other conditions. Unfortunately, the woman he loves, Anne, is nowhere to be found (Renée Zellweger) so his best friend (Artie Lange) puts an ad in the paper, which attracts a thousand wannabe brides literally chasing the bachelor and his fortune. Marley Shelton plays Anne's sister while Edward Asner and Hal Holbrook have side roles.The movie has a great cast and a fun vibe. O'Donnell and Zellweger are appealing protagonists, but I was bored by most of the first 45 minutes. Thankfully, the story perks up when the bachelor seeks out several past girlfriends and unconvincingly proposes. This sequence features entertaining cameos by the likes of Jennifer Esposito, Mariah Carey, Brooke Shields, Sarah Silverman, Stacy Edwards and Katharine Towne. Unfortunately, the filmmakers failed to take advantage of this wealth of feminine resources with the exception of the striking Esposito and Shields, the latter of whom is delightful as a gold-digging biyatch. The rest are underutilized. Nevertheless, Katharine Towne shines in her small role.The most memorable sequence, of course, is the dude being chased through the streets of San Francisco by a thousand brides, but this only comprises about a dozen minutes of the movie. Those who favor romcoms might like this one better than I did. For me, it's not bad, but it's not good either, although there are some amusing moments. The plot is creative, but the script needed tweaked to flesh out its potential.The film runs 101 minutes and was shot in San Francisco; downtown L.A. and USC; and Cook Ranch, Galisteo, New Mexico.GRADE: C</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bachelor is a 1999 movie starring Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zewelleger. It showed excellent promise for a lazy New Year's day. The story revolves around Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell) who fears marriage and the end of his life as a "mustang". He adores his girlfriend's Ann (Zellweger) and eventually proposes to her, feeling that he has no choice. The proposal is disastrous but the two love each other and it appears as though they may work things out despite Jimmie's serious mental issues (my own opinion and by no means a certified medical diagnosis). However, when Jimmie's grandfather dies and necessitates that Jimmie must marry before his 30th birthday in order to inherit a 100 million dollars and more importantly save Jimmie's fledging pool table business, things become complicated and?.ridiculous. It was a cute idea and despite some excellent attempts on part of the actors, this movie fails to work and the ending is nothing short of stupid. My advice is give this movie a big miss. O'Donnell and Zellweger have done much better things in the last fourteen years that are more worthy of your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bachelor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw an advert for this film and I guessed it was going to be no more or less than two stars out of five, and not just because of the leading actor who has a rather mixed career, but I was willing to give it a chance. Basically Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) has been watching his friends get married to their girlfriends every time they have caught the bouquet, and he really hopes it doesn't happen with his long time girlfriend Anne Arden (Renée Zellweger), he wants to remain a "mustang". Of course this unwanted occurrence happens, and naturally Anne expects to be proposed to in a very romantic way, but Jimmie bottles it and botches any real meaningful proposal, because he doesn't feel up to marrying. While she leaves him to go on a work assignment, he finds out that his Grandad James Shannon (Peter Ustinov) has died, and in his recorded video last will and testament he is told that he is to inherit $100 million, provided that he is married, together for five years, and fathers a child. Jimmie's deadline is his thirtieth birthday at the time he was born, 6:05pm, and it is a race against time as this turns out to be tomorrow, so with twenty seven hours to go and his true love unavailable to propose to again he relies on his friends to find a woman willing. He ends up backtracking to past relationships he has had with various women, including loud stock market player Stacey (Rebecca Cross), clingy window dresser Zoe (Stacy Edwards), stage operatic singer Ilana (Mariah Carey), uppity Carolyn (Sarah Silverman), and a near marriage to Buckley Hale-Windsor (Brooke Shields) who wanted to money, but backed out at the idea of five years, not parting for more than one day a year, and having children. With time running out and knowing that if the money is not inherited companies will fall, accounts will be frozen and employees will be laid off, and desperate Marco (Artie Lange) places a small ad in the newspaper to find a last minute bride who will share the fortune. Of course a mistake is made and the article becomes the newspaper front page, so thousands of various women of all shapes, sizes, ages and religions dash to the church where the ceremony will apparently be held, Jimmie is trapped and running from them all. All along it turns out that Anne didn't go away because she felt too much for him, and when she realises that this situation is going on she decides to get her own white dress on and find him before the deadline comes. In the end, in front of the thousands of wannabe brides Jimmie gives a real loving proposal, ready to marry his true love, and he and Anne are married by The Priest (James Cromwell) moments before the time of 6:05pm, the fortune is safe, and the bouquet is thrown. Also starring Edward Asner as Sid Gluckman, Hal Holbrook as Roy O'Dell, Marley Shelton as Natalie Arden, Katharine Towne as Monique and Jennifer Esposito as Daphne. O'Donnell gives an alright performance if a little lacking in charisma, Zellweger is of course gorgeous and lovingly innocent, the moments between him and the ex-partners are alright with big names, especially the bitchy Shields, and the highlight is indeed all the thousands of white dressed women chasing him down the streets, I agree it is not the best, but it is not a terrible romantic comedy. Okay!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This move was entertaining -- in a shallow sort of way -- and even though I knew how it would end, it was fun seeing how the characters got there. Loved the use of music and shots of mustangs. I think the turnaround -- where women are more empowered -- is important, especially for women who are younger than I am!!! It was also wonderful to see some really seasoned actors (Peter Ustinov, Ed Asner, Hal Holbrook) having fun with the silliness of the plot and that old standby, James Cromwell, was great as the priest. Now, what I really want to call your attention to is a wicked continuity glitch toward the end -- Renee Zellwegger's flowers change back and forth from peach roses to yellow lilies -- was someone asleep at the wheel in the editing room???</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was on TV, with a crappy rating (1 star); I recorded it, based on liking Zellweger (how bad could it be?), and wound up liking the film, but being disappointed in René Zellweger. At one point, she does something that told me "This is a character that was written for Jennifer Aniston, but there was a schedule conflict, so they asked René Zellweger instead." René does her job, but she doesn't bring anything personal to the role. Meanwhile, the cadre of elders surrounding The Bachelor himself( Hal Hollbrook, Ed Asner, James Cromwell and !Peter Ustinov!) has many of the best lines in the film. Towards the end, it veers into surrealism, with an army of would-be brides demanding "Criteria! Criteria" as if at a labor rally, then becoming an army divided into three battalions that converge on a single SF intersection in pursuit of the Bachelor. It's worth seeing, if only for the script.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Bachelor is a romantic comedy what more can I say. So if you I fan of the genre its likely that you will enjoy this film. However, if you're not it not worth a look it ok and the acting is not bad. Over all the plot is a bit doggy and the story some times verges on the ridicules (the mob of wanabe brides. what?). Nevertheless, I'm still a little undecided because it did make me laugh. So it's a 4 out of 10 for The Bachelor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mediocre film about commitment, marriage and cash!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, 'The Bachelor' tries hard to be a romantic comedy but ultimately won't be a classic! Something just wasn't there in this film. The concept was okay but it's been done before in many different variations. I liked the idea of Chris O'Donnell's character being afraid of marriage, and I liked the juxtaposition with the horses and the grooms- that was pretty funny.The problem with this film was mainly the acting! Not really from Renee Zellweger, but more from Chris O'Donnell and the supporting cast. Some of the lines seemed forced on their delivery from Chris, and in scenes in was noticeable. O'Donnell's friend and side-kick was almost extremely bad, acting wise, from the start of the film. Note I said 'almost', it wasn't excruciatingly bad, it just seemed like the actor was "acting"! The other problem was parts of the script- and Peter Ustinov was wasted in his role.SOME MAJOR SPOILERS IN THE REST OF THIS REVIEW The parts I liked was the reference to 'Brewster's Millions'- that was cool. 'Brewster's Millions' was the first film I thought of during the lawyers/reading of the will scene- and they acknowledged that in that scene. I also liked Renee Zellweger in this film, although it wasn't her best role. The other aspect I will mention, is that when you read a review that states 'The Bachelor' is misogynist because of it's depiction of O'Donnell's former girlfriends and the huge number of women desperate for a slice of 100 million dollars- it actually makes you want to like 'The Bachelor' more. Because the comment is so stupid.I mean seriously, I've seen 'Who Wants to Marry a Millionaire'- we all know there would be a huge turnout of single women if it meant a chance at a stake at 100 million dollars. It's not misogyny, guys would do the same thing too! I mean, lets face it, most guys/bachelors fear commitment to a certain extent. Chris O'Donnell's character only became serious about marriage to get 100 million dollars- and was prepared to marry the person he didn't love for it. What does that say about his character? As for the former girlfriends- well lighten up, the majority of them were portrayed nobly because most of them said "no" to O'Donnell's proposal even with 100 million (that's what I didn't buy).So regardless, although I am defending 'The Bachelor' against accusations of being misogynist- it really wasn't that great a film. A lame attempt at romantic comedy, and the acting could have been better as with some aspects of the script, and the ending was pretty bad. But in general, if you want to kill an hour or so, this is not a head-strain and it is a fairly standard comedy. It may give you a chuckle but that's about it! Can't say I really liked 'The Bachelor', neither can I say I hated it. It was mediocre- **1/2 out of *****!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Offensive and Insulting.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was awful. The plot was slow, the performances uninspired, and the laughs few and far between. However, I can forgive that. What I cannot forgive is the complete and utter lack of any kind of awareness about its offensive, misogynist viewpoint. Women were portrayed in the most unflattering light I have seen on film in a very long time. Every stereotype was trotted out (the smart Jewish girl, the diva, the bitchy rich woman, etc.), and just when I thought the film was going to perhaps address the stereotype and redeem itself, the script lunged for an easy laugh (and an unfunny one at that.) The inherent premise of the film--that every women is simply dying to marry a millionaire--was unfortunate. The existence of shows such as "Who Wants To Marry a Millionaire" show that there are women who do indeed have this desire, but to suggest all women fall into that category is horribly unfair. And to deal with the subject in such an broad and slapstick way was sick. I was offended at every moment in this movie. I cannot understand why any of the principles had anything to do with this project. I can only be grateful that I did not pay any money to see The Bachelor, and counsel anybody reading this not to spend their money on it, either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Starring: Chris O'Donnell, Renée Zellweger, James Cromwell, Hal Holbrook, and Brooke ShieldsDirectors: Buster Keaton and Gary Sinyor Running time: 101 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some sex-related material) 1/2* 2 out of 10The Bachelor was a cheap imitation of a comedy that was ongoing and boring. It wasn't boring in a sense of nothing there; it was boring in a sense that you didn't know what was going on and you didnt want to waste enough energy toget to know what was going on. The characters were never introduced and the plot was very uneasy because they weren't introduced.About the plot, it was uneasy because the film had no emotion. The actors/actresses said their lines with no charisma. They basically had a script and read it. In a good movie you can't do that, if you want viewers to like it they have to feel it. I think "Buckley" (played by Brook Shields) was a very good character. It's sad when the supporting roles are played better than the main ones. As a viewer I didn't know the names of characters and I didn't care enough to know. This whole movie is supposed to take place in two days but within two days Anne goes to Athens and back then goes away again with her sister. He asks 16 people to marry him in a matter of a couple hours. Mariah Carey really messed up upon taking the role of one of the woman. She had no personality or a sense of character at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "So I Married An Axe Murderer" homage</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bachelor" is a funny, offbeat film that follows Jimmie Shannon (O'Donnell), a bachelor who loves the life and is terrified of marriage. Things take a turn on him though when his grandfather passes away and leaves him with a $100 million fortune on the condition that he get hitched before his 30th birthday which is just 24 hours away. Armed with a mysterious priest, a limo, and the help of his best friend, Jimmie finds himself getting rejected by every ex-girlfriend he had due to a screwup with his girlfriend (Zellweger) who is the perfect one. "The Bachelor" seems reminiscent of "So I Married An Axe Murderer", the Mike Myers comedy about a poet who loves the life and is terrified of marriage. Aside from the plotline, the poet has a best friend and lives in San Francisco. Definitely a worthy rental. "The Bachelor" is a great film but if you're expecting a complete romantic comedy, you'll be a little disappointed. Judging from it's marketing campaign, you might've gotten that impression but it turns out to be an offbeat comedy.</fullReview>

The scene in the Starlight room was probably my favourite, but there are quite a few rather amusing scenes.

		<fullReview>I saw "The Bachelor" tonight with my boyfriend at the dollar theater tonight, and even though I loved the classic romantic story, and even got a few laughs out of it, I noticed some subtle messages in the movie that disturb me.When it comes down to it, this movie seems to perpetuate a Hollywood stereotype: you have to be young, blonde and thin in order to marry a young, handsome millionaire.I noticed that although there was a diversity of women represented in the hundreds of bridal extras, they were portrayed in a negative light as they bickered, shouted, argued, begged, whined and accused each other to get the bachelor.Also, in a time when minority roles on TV and in films is actually shrinking, it was most disappointing to me that neither the bachelor character nor his girlfriend had anyone who was of a different race or disabled, etc., in their circle of close friends (people that stayed with them throughout the movie). Notice that none of the bachelor's former girlfriends were disabled, overweight, or of another ethnicity. I find this hard to believe as the movie is set in racially diverse San Francisco.This movie has other flaws which have been pointed out by numerous other reviewers, but this is one that is a lot more subtle that I hope will be corrected in other films in the future.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good date movie, but not one that should be seen alone.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit that I wasn't exactly thrilled to have to see "The Bachelor." However, with deadlines weighing down and other stuff to do, I knew I had to get it done, no matter what the pain. I thought this would be a chick flick. Or, at least so I thought, but it later turned out.that I was right. It was a chick flick. "The Bachelor" starts out with a scene of mustangs (horses, not the cars) running across the Western plains as Chris O'Donnell ("Batman &amp; Robin") narrates a comparison of men to mustangs, trying to run free while looking for the "sweet grasses," but still trying to avoid getting roped. The use of the metaphor throughout the whole story bears strange resemblence to another movie (out in theaters now) which uses the same technique. The actual meat of the story begins with Mr. O'Donnell, playing Jimmy Shannon, a (duh) bachelor. At the time, he is trying to break up with his girlfriend in the restaurant while sitting at a booth next to one holding Anne, played by Renee Zellweger (who has a strange name). After Jimmy's breakup, Anne flirts with him, and they for some strange reason start to date. At this point, I must point out that I went into the theater expecting O'Donnell to be a wooden emotionless actor, but I was surprised. He is decent, at least. I cannot say the same for Zellweger, who's irritating voice, irritating pouting, and irritating lack of emotion were, needless to say, irritating! Hmm.what other movie has a leading lady like this ("I'll never let go, Jack!")? Aside from her though, the acting is overall good.Anyway, the story proceeds to explain the dating of Anne and Jimmy, and the evictment of all of Jimmy's friends from bachelor hood by the most dreaded of events: the tossing of the bouquet. Eventually Anne catches it and Jimmy, being commitmentphobic, doesn't want to go through with it. He tries to get advice from a bunch of his fellow workers at the pool hall he owns. One of these workers is the folically challenged Ed Asner (I don't care if you haven't heard of him), who tries to help, but fails. When Jimmy is at a high class romantic restaurant with Anne, he makes a horribly botched attempt at proposal. The words of love: "You win." Anne is ticked off. She doesn't respond to his phone calls and doesn't take notice of the three zillion roses she sends to him. Then Jimmy's grandfather dies. Now, the grandfather's main prospect for his grandson was that he marry and procreate, as required in the old man's will. Unless Jimmy marries a girl, lives with her for ten years, hangs around with her practically all the time, and has children by her, he cannot collect the inheritance. The inheritance? Oh, not much, just One Hundred Million Dollars! So now Jimmy is desperate. He tries one last time to propose to Anne, but it also fails, as Jimmy can't keep the proper game face for proposal. Anne goes away with her sister on a retreat, and Jimmy is left asking every girl he ever dated to marry him. These escapades are at times amusing, as Jimmy goes through six or seven women, always getting "no" for an answer, or even better, a slap or an effigy of himself up in flames. The best part of these scenes is the fact that a few of the girls are big name stars. Jennifer Esposito plays Daphne, a cop. Brooke Shields plays Buckley, the girl who gets closest to marrying Jimmy. The best cameo was Ilana, played by everyone's favorite "Heartbreaker," Mariah Carey, who surprisingly plays a singer (who would've thought?). The basic plot line from then on is Jimmy's attempt to hook up with Anne, while all of the workers at his pool hall just want him hitched, for without the money, the place will shut down. It's a race against time, as the marriage must be made by 6:05pm on Jimmy's 30th birthday! What will happen? Will they make it in time? Does anybody care? Not me, frankly. This is not the sort of a movie that a guy could just sit down and watch. You need a significant other to enjoy "The Bachelor." Guys, you gotta bring your girlfriend to this, otherwise you will not enjoy it. You need support when watching this film, at least for the first half. It perks up after that, but if you don't have someone to revive you, you'll sleep through the whole thing, and the ushers in the theater will pop your limp form into a bag and you'll wake up in a trash can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My best friend and I were bored the Friday night "The Bachelor" came out. We had already had our fun making fun of "Bats" and realized this film was playing. I walked into the theater expecting to hate it and give it zero stars. My friend and I sat down and started to make fun of it. We continued to do this until... we laughed. When the gigantic black man cursed as his girlfriend caught the bouquet, we stopped mocking it and laughed. After all, you can't laugh at a film that forces you to laugh with it. I was happily surprised at this film and I'm sure most people would be. It is not the best film, but its better than "Bats"(Sorry Leon).</fullReview>

It really looked pretty stupid ........ But other than that it was a good one that had it's moments. This one might take Chris and Renee Zellweger a long way ahead in their respective careers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'The Bachelor' is a light hearted comedy about the transition that a young man experiences going from bachelorhood to married life. The only difference is that this young man's transition is rather rushed as he must become married in order to qualify for an inheritance. This movie had the potential to be a lot funnier than what resulted but it was still somewhat humorous.Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) is a young bachelor that is presented with a rather unique opportunity to become a very wealthy man. Jimmie's cantankerous old grandfather passes away and leaves a $100 million inheritance for him but there are conditions attached to it. In order for him to recieve this money, he has to get married by the time he turns 30. The only problem is that Jimmie turns 30 in less than 24 hours from the time he hears about the inheritance. As you can probably guess, Jimmie spends the rest of the movie trying to find a woman who will marry him. Normally this probably wouldn't be a problem if the woman knew that she was marrying into a $100 million except that Jimmie finds intolerable faults with every exgirlfriend except for one girl (Renee Zellweger) that he truly loves. Only problem is that they had a fight recently and broke up before Jimmie found out about his inheritance therefore his task becomes doubly difficult.As I mentioned, the storyline had the potential to create a very humorus movie but I found myself occassionally bored and the laughs that it did produce were good enough to generate a chuckle but nothing more. Most of this movie focussed around the pseudo relationship between O'Donnell's character and Zellweger's character but the story telling was rather disjointed. On the one side the movie tried to show the humor of the situation and the dilemma that O'Donnell's character was facing as he continually had problems proposing to different women, including Zellweger's character. On the other side, the movie tried to show the woman's side of it through the eyes of Zellweger but it almost felt like two different movies. The movie didn't have the identity of a romantic comedy (which I thought it was trying to be) nor was it out right hilarious to be a true comedy.I found O'Donnell's performance a little over-the-top as he tried to generate the humor. At times he seemed on the verge of being uncontrolled in his performance and at other times he didn't seem to quite grasp the art of comedic acting. I've seen Zellweger in other movies and to date her acting range has been fairly narrow. She always seems to have the same emotions but I guess if the story doesn't demand very much in that department, you're not going to get that big a range in performance. I also found the writing rather poor as some of the lines just didn't seem to fit and ended up making the delivery of them awkward.Despite the negatives that I pointed out, there were some humorous moments but in the end they were not gut-bustingly funny. Overall, if you want to see this movie, I would suggest you go see it as a matinee but it is definitely not worth full admission.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Broadway Movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Welcome back, Chris O'Donnell !! His inspiration of his career hasn't changed a bit. Although I haven't seen any movie he played with such energy and joyful. If people are looking for sweet and joyful movie, this "Broadway" style movie will be their seasoning for the night. Joyful, not too much because Renee plays on her expert character (bitter but sincere). So the movie is well balanced. Enough music and some goose bumb scene are included in this movie. Like the scene when Rupert Everett dedicated a song to Julian (Julie Robert) at a lobster restaurant. Who would expect it to be happen in a such bright sunlight day!! Well, this handsome bachelor (Chris O'Donnell) plays as a "either shit or get off the pot" role. He doesn't want to get married because his astrological sign was "Taurus" in a wild field. The fun become heavily increase by the end of the movie. How would you liked to be chase by millions brides?</fullReview>

So we went anyway.The movie is basically about this guy who has about 24 hours to get married and save the family business. What they don't tell you is that he is already in love but can't quite come to terms with committment otherwise he wouldn't end up chasing down a bride before the deadline. The movie is basically about him chasing down a bride while coming to realize there is only one woman for him and only she will do. I don't want to spoil it but there is a happy ending. I really enjoyed this movie and Chris and Renee were very good in it. It is basically a light romantic comedy and worth full price.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the silliest and most pretentious romantic comedies. Who knows what the director was thinking? I think the writer was under time pressure and couldn't come up with a better script. There are a few funny moments and the only acting performance that stands out is Renee Zellweger, even though her role is very badly written (as is everyone else's). We do get to see a host of other beautiful women (though their screen time is limited) like Mariah Carrey, Jennifer Esposito and Brooke Shields. Chris O'Donnell is wooden while the rest of the cast are mostly annoying. Avoid this movie and Zellweger fans are better off watching her other works.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It sounds like a nightmare - you should marry in next 24 hours or lose a mighty heritage. The problem might not be that big, but the best girl you know happens to be mad at you and she's moving to other country. You did propose to her but you did that in such a manner that you have to pay now a perhaps too high a price for it.The Bachelor himself seems to think "no big deal" and he takes it all that calmly that it's no surprise if you happen to forget his grand problem. On the other hand the supposed-to-be-Bride (Zellweger) doesn't fail and she's the best part in the whole film. Even if the film hardly appears as entirely interesting you may want to see the crowd of brides chasing hapless Bachelor down the streets, but hardly anything else here produces great moments, though it doesn't irritate much either.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film was cute, but should have been edited more (i.e. about 20 minutes too long for the content). It looks as though the producer/editor did not have enough time to thoroughly develop the plot, so some aspects of the film drag on. It had a lot of potential which was only partially developed. The film is not worth 10 lines of comment, so I will fill up space with useless chatter, kinda like the film did. Rene and the girl who played her room mate were very good. The scenes about the room mate's family did not enhance the movie and seemed irrelevant to the plot. Again, the main problem stems from the film's "lack of effort" to fulfill a decent potential. It was funny, but was more like an hour TV show than a full length movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The painful aspect of watching this remake of a Buster Keaton classic is that you can actually see where it misses all that it tries so hard to hit. Chris O'Donnell and the rest of the cast somehow manage to come out relatively unscathed from this unfunny mishap of a movie. The major problem with the film? It tries to combine aspects of AMERICAN PIE and WHEN HARRY MET SALLY-type films. What it does not realize is how perfectly AMERICAN PIE walked the thin line that it laid out for itself. THE BACHELOR tries to combine both films and in weaving between the two, misses everything completely. It was simply painful to watch Chris O'Donnell and company try to stretch the film to hit the marks that it so clearly misses. Stay away from this bachelor!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bridal Marathon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One problem with romantic comedies is that we have almost seen them all. Being based on an over 80-year-old Broadway play does not make it easier to find any original ideas in them, especially if they have been already adapted for the big screen by one of the greatest comic masterminds of all times. "The Bachelor" is unfortunately a very good example for this particular kind of rather uninspired romantic flicks. It was Buster Keaton who brought Roi Cooper Megrue's classic boulevard theater play "Seven Chances" in 1925 into the American cinemas. And it was German actor Heinz Ruehmann who explored the role of Jimmy Shannon in the 30s for the famed UFA (before the Nazis took the German film industry over and turned it into a rather powerless propaganda instrument). Moreover, the play itself is only a variation on the well-known comedy "Brewster Millions" which is dealing with almost the same subject. A young man is faced with a rather ridiculous will of an eccentric family member. In "The Bachelor" it is British character actor Sir Peter Ustinov who plays a meat-loving Grandpa to Ex-Batman-Sidekick Chris O'Donnell bugging him to finally marry his girl. But Jimmy Shannon is a typical bachelor, who are defined as ...uups...wild mustangs. This animal symbol seems to be quite obvious. At least to screenwriter Steve Cohen who overcame his writer' s block by turning Jimmy into a human equivalent to the proud horses of the American praeries. This seems to be legitimate, but is also the first of many self-explanatory impressions which slow the movie already at the beginning down to a sudden standstill. Because, although many men might understand why Jimmy loves his freedom as a former womanizer, he is presented to us, in fact, as being trapped in a lasting relationship. Without him showing any signs of being tired of it. He isn' t cheating on his girl-friend Anne, he isn' t even looking or thinking of other women. Nor has he a real buddy friendship which would hinder him to get married. The only reason why he is constantly screwing up his proposals is the fact, that all his co-workers got married before him and lost...well...what exactly? We never get to know what it really is this mustang named Jimmy is missing. Instead, his grandpa' s last will forces him into a solid marriage of 10 years producing at least one or two biological offsprings in order to save his own factory from being sold to an anonymous consortium. Now, Jimmy is really stressed out, because he has to convince his girl-friend Anne within less than two days that he is her true love and ergo the only man for her to marry. When his rather half-hearted attempts of proposal fail he has to sort through his former flames to fullfill his grandpa's conditions in time, but, of course, he fails again. Finally, when we get introduced to cameo guest stars like Mariah Carey as opera singer Ilana or Brooke Shields as the vampish daughter of the priest who is about to marry Jimmy to whoever is left over, the story starts to become entertaining. Still, the old men in the background - Edward Asner, Hal Holbrook and James Cromwell - get the best scenes, until Chris O'Donnnell finally has to run for his life - being chased by around 500 brides of all ages, sizes, ethnicities and sexual preferences (including some of the famous Castro Street transvestites) up and down the hills around San Francisco' s Market Street in reminiscence of Buster Keaton' s original film ending. But even then Gary Sinyor isn' t able or willing to round the wild slapstick scene up in a real funny oneliner. Instead, Rene'e Zellweger who either whines or drinks too much throughout the whole movie delivers a rather pointless speech to the brides in vane who hoped that they would become the happy wife of a multi-millionaire. In the same way we wonder throughout the whole movie why Jimmy can' t simply confess the obvious - namely that he loves Anne and wants to marry her - we never really get to know why Anne is so totally disappointed by him. Okay, he has this 'bachelor"-look. So what? The only reason we are presented is his first proposal which ends with the unhappy remark "You win". A phrase which is repeated at least 30 times within 15 film minutes, boring the idea of a running-gag into pieces. This is a very good example for the overall bad timing of the movie which contains too much redundant dialogue and too less funny situations to make it a real good comedy. In the end there are too few memorable moments - like the chase secene - to make this movie more than a routine Hollywood flick. Recommendable on video or as TV pick of the day, but a little too boneless for a true romantic movie experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Madcap and entertaining romantic comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this to be a madcap and highly entertaining romantic comedy. This is a remake of the 1925 Buster Keaton classic, ?Seven Chances' and this story has been trotted out a number of times since in various forms so the material is far from fresh. Jimmie Shannon (Chris O'Donnell) is a confirmed bachelor who finds himself in love with Anne (Rene Zellweger). As his friends begin dropping like flies to the marriage bug, Jimmie realizes that his time too has come. So he proposes to Anne, but he botches it, making it so unromantic that despite desperately wanting to accept, she runs from the room. When his grandfather dies, he discovers that he is the sole heir to a vast fortune of $100 million, but to get it, he needs to get married by 6:05 PM on his birthday, which as it happens is the following day. With his one true love gone, he must marry someone, so he begins a litany of successive proposals to all his old girlfriends.The story is utterly predictable and overly zany. It is comedy in its simplest and most unsophisticated form. Slapstick, if done well can be very funny, and this was done well. There were numerous belly laughs in this film from the many sight gags and absurd situations that develop. The romance between Jimmie and Anne was also charming.The direction by Gary Sinyor was nothing special from a visual standpoint, but I felt he handled the setup of the sight gags well and did a good job of orchestrating the movement of the thousand or so brides in the chase scene (worthy of any Keystone Kops skit). The special effects on the Mustang scenes were pretty weak, though.Chris O'Donnell was very good in his role as Jimmie. His comedic timing was mostly effective, and he succeeded in looking totally hapless in his various scenes with erstwhile girlfriends. I thought his chemistry with Zellweger was excellent and sincere, especially at the end.Rene Zellweger was a good choice for this role. Though she is no goddess, she has a very natural, sweet and wholesome attractiveness; very real and vulnerable. She really made the romantic part of the story single-handedly with her misty eyed looks and genuine longing for Jimmie.I rated this film an 8/10. I enjoy this kind of silly romantic farce, but it is not for everyone. It requires an ability to laugh at absurd, pratfall humor. If you are in the mood for a good light date movie, this might be a good choice. But, if you don't like slapstick, you will probably want to steer clear.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cut and Paste look at marriage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Robert Altman's The Player, studio executives demonstrate how a film idea can turn from one person's artistic vision into a shallow appeal to the masses. When I watch a film like The Bachelor, I often wonder what went on when that film was pitched.Chris O'Donnell is perfectly cast as the likeable hunk who can't quite bring himself to commit to marriage. Life with girlfriend Anne is perfect because she doesn't seem to have any desire to take that extra step either. The day that she does start to think about 'the future' things take a nasty turn. O'Donnell as Jimmy struggles through a proposal, simply because his peers tell him he must. Anne turns him down, of course, because his intentions are not honorable. The plot thickens when Jimmy's ornery grandfather dies and leaves a 100 million dollar fortune to Jimmy, the only surviving relative. The catch is that our hero can only collect the money if he is married by his 30th birthday, which just happens to be in one day. A daring move, one of the lawyers utters something about this being 'Brewster's Millions.' A clever line, obviously written by someone brave enough to admit that this plot is a total rip off.With the aid of his best friend, a few lawyers and a stoic priest (played by James Cromwell), he sets about trying to win the heart of Anne. When that doesn't succeed, Jimmy goes through the list of old girlfriends, most of whom are personality challenged, and some of whom do not remember him fondly. Anyone with a weak heart might melt at the image of O'Donnell running through the streets of San Francisco with a bouquet of flowers, others would probably be wise just to pass. O'Donnell and Zellweger play well in this film, but like most cardboard comedies, there isn't much for the actors to do.One might spot an attempt a some black humor, in the same vein as better films like Heathers and Election, but it failures to even come close to those. The Bachelor presents an opening thesis using wild mustangs to describe men. As each of his friends gets hitched, we see them running along side a herd of these horses, a lasso about to snag them. This joke is mildly clever, but sadly it is also the best thing about the film. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm still not sure about the pairing of Renée Zellweger and Chris O'Donnell (somehow she looks a LOT older than him, and is way too quirky) but on the whole I enjoyed this movie. There are some very funny moments, and an outstanding (if slightly strange!) supporting cast - Ustinov, Cromwell, Shields, Carey, Asner, Holbrook - each worth watching in their own right.Slightly wacky, it doesn't take itself too seriously (how could it, with stars as diverse as Maria Carey and Peter Ustinov?!) and plays along at a nice pace. It feels good to watch, and my only criticism is there's not enough of Marley Shelton, who for me gives the best performance of all. She and Zellweger undoubtedly provide the best scenes.It's a classic comedy, it does what it says on the tin. If you need entertaining, then look no further.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't want to see this movie because it looked bad and Chris O. and Rene Z. are very overrated. When my wife brought it home from the video store, I groaned but decided to give it a fair chance. From the start, I knew I was right about this movie. The basic premise is interesting, albeit, not very realistic. I chuckled in a few places but had to grit my teeth and bite my tongue through the rest of it. The acting was forced, very stiff, and the lines were delivered with poor timing. I didn't believe either of the main characters because they seemed to be reading straight from the script. I won't even bother mentioning all the timeline impossibilities. Basically, this was a bummer of a movie. 'Nuff said. Now, where can I get a hold of the Buster Keaton version? That sounds good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this movie was OK. Chris O'Donnell and Renee Zellweger turn in OK performances. I think the language was too strong for a PG-13 film, and the film really lost steam in the last half hour or so. I liked the character of the priest, and Brooke Shields has an amusing cameo here. But the film on the whole isn't very good, and is forgettable. I think the premise was good and the execution was poor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have loved this film so much since the first time I saw it. I have actually watched this repeatedly. I find the casting great, the lines funny in a feel good sort of way. Even the different insights about marriage given by the supporting characters are funny,making the viewer understands Jimmy's hesitation and confusion in tying the knot with Anne. The brief scenes of Jimmy's past girlfriends are enough to give the audience a view of their individual personalities. Every single one of them are interesting. Quite disappointed with Mariah's appearance in the film,though, it's too short and forgettable but then over all,the film is interestingly funny,entertaining and a must watch especially for romantics and those that are and hope to be in a long time relationship.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshingly witty genre filler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Full of witty lines, comic situations and a fun, upbeat soundtrack, every scene in The Bachelor is shot to get the utmost comedy from the script, so as a comedy, this film is excellent. Where it falls down slightly is with the romance.Jimmie Shannon has to get married before his thirtieth birthday or he loses out on his inheritance, and sees all his employees at his billiard table factory out of work as the sharks move in and buy out his business (a clever device, making Jimmie have to sacrifice himself, rather than be greedy for money). So he has to get married. Only problem is, his birthday is tomorrow, and love of his life Anne just walked out on him. So now he has to ask each of his ex-girlfriends if they wouldn't mind entering into a loveless marriage, and failing that, gets his face in the paper and a church-full of angry brides-to-be. All very fun.But the crux of the plot rests on Jimmie's inability to propose to Anne. But he repeats how he loves her, and admits he wants to spend the rest of his life with her, so when towards the end of the film he has a revelation that she is the one he wants to marry, it's rather difficult for the audience to comprehend what his problem was in the first place. It is never explained why he fears marriage, since he is happy to stay in a long-term monogamous relationship with Anne. This relationship itself is not on screen much, as the first twenty or so minutes of the film whizz the audience through the relationship by Jimmie's narration, without a look in to how Anne feels, odd, since the rest of the film cuts between the two of them.But ultimately, even with a slightly unclear reason for the whole 'bachelor' thing, and a slight cheapness to the style, and forgiving the blatant continuity error of Anne's bouquet at the end, and the fact that Renée Zellweger sounds dubbed for a lot of the film (it's just the way she speaks) this is a constant laugh-out-loud comedy and definitely worth it.</fullReview>

Enjoy it for what it is. If you're looking for something more, then watch that. But, if you'd like something light that you can fall into for awhile then enjoy The Bachelor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just not very funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BACHELOR is a remake of an old Buster Keaton flick, about a guy who stands to inherit a great deal of money if he marries by a certain date. But this remake is not nearly as funny, probably because Chris O'Donnell is a poor substitute for Keaton. I am not sure who could have brought more to the role, but I am thinking almost anyone but O'Donnell would have. Rene Z. as O'Donnell's one true love is cute as a button in this, but given little to do. The start of the movie has a lot of funny one liners as O'Donnell huddles with his best buddy (Artie Lange) and grandpa (Peter Ustinov) about his condition in life even as all his pals marry off. O'Donnell's botched proposal scene with Rene Z., carried out in a restaurant surrounded by several schmoes simultaneously proposing, is also quite funny. But the funny lines quickly dissipate as O'Donnell goes on to romance several ex-gal pals and we end up with a big finale featuring several dozen gals in full wedding regalia pursuing O'Donnell. This should have been a riot but it falls flat. Save THE BACHELOR for a rainy Saturday, if at all. God knows it runs on TV often enough, so I assume someone enjoys it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad, though not completely awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was critically destroyed when it was released, but it is not that bad, it is just a harmless little romantic comedy. The worst thing about it is that its view of male-female relationships is so backward - especially in a movie set in modern-day San Francisco!. Chris O'Donnell is not a great actor, but he is good portraying this earnest, somewhat shallow man. And Renee Zellweger is fine, even though her cinematic persona has by now overstayed its welcome. I haven't seen Buster Keaton's original movie, but I don't doubt it was vastly superior to this, but this. Still, this new version might be a passable time-killer in a rainy Friday night.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A new route around an old plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be honest, I only watched this film because of the Buster Keaton connection: every mention of it I could find was dismissive to the utmost ('romantic comedy that's neither funny nor romantic'), and I had every expectation of a cringe-making experience. But to my surprise, I actually rather enjoyed it."The Bachelor" is a romantic comedy for the 1990s, which aims not so much at soliciting laughs from its audience but at winces of sympathy (the male portion) and eye-rollings (the female portion). Updated for its era, it becomes not the story of a man too shy to propose, but, as the title suggests, of one terrified of 'commitment' -- in "Seven Chances", Keaton took a contemporary stage farce and converted it into simply the preliminary set-up for a trademark chase sequence, while "The Bachelor" is built at heart around the situation of "the world's worst proposal" and how the hero can possibly convince his girl that his change of heart is for real. Considered on its own terms it is equally as good, and with its shifted emphasis on the central character's learning process it can scarcely be considered a remake at all. The potential brides in this version are all girlfriends Jimmie has previously dumped or split up with, and the self-proclaimed 'wild free mustang' comes to realise painfully that not every woman is dying to bring him down and jam the ring on his finger after all! Perhaps unsurprisingly, the elements that felt forced to me were those cloned more directly from the earlier film and thrust into the plot: Jimmie's sudden revelation as heir to the family snooker empire, and consequent attack of conscience on its workers' behalf, and the Chase of the Brides. Chris O'Donnell is no physical match for Buster Keaton, and invoking the direct comparison is unwise.The isn't a laugh-out-loud comedy caper, and to be fair I don't think it was ever intended to be. But as a modern entry in the "war of the sexes" genre it's inoffensive, undemanding and entertaining: it could easily have been toe-curlingly bad, and it's not. The plot is satisfactory, the characters' growth towards one another plausible, and the hero's predicament grotesque without descending into 'gross-out' territory. I started this film prejudiced against it; I came out in its favour. That's a pretty good endorsement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very poor flick, in every aspect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am aware that "the Bachelor" is supposed to be found in the romantic comedy pile, yet desturbingly I found it to be neither funny nor romantic.The only adequate description for it would be unispired and halfhearted attempt of a remake of a Buster Keaton classic. As far as the acting goes, I have never found Chris O´Donell worthy of the star status placed on his shoulders. He simply does not have any charisma or charm. He is not entiry untallented but is an altogether poor actor who should not play the leading role in movies even as poor as this one.Even Renee Zellwegger lacked her usual poise and childish charm. However, she was one of the less disappointing aspects of this mess. Another noteworthy element is the brief appearance of Brooke Shields which is one of her best roles. As far as the plot goes, the less I say about it the better. It is a good idea in theory, but the writers have messed up the idea completely. There are so many plot holes, and times where you are left wondering what happened. The characters are rather unrealistic and do illogical things. Very annoying. Even if you are a huge fan of the Romantic/Comedy genre, give this one a miss. Practically anything else would be better. I watched it with my girlfriend and I do not think that any of us felt we got our moneys worth. Quite simply this flick is bad. 2/10.</fullReview>

This movie would probably be called cute. It isn't really laugh out loud funny, but it is somewhat humorous. I burst out laughing at the scene in the Starlight Room. The music is not the best either...but it is good for a movie of this sort. Bob Marley....yummy. If you enjoy quirky romantic comedies, then this film is for you. I enjoyed it, but not as much as I have enjoyed other romantic comedies. I would recommend DOG PARK, YOU'VE GOT MAIL and maybe NEVER BEEN KISSED. See it and decide.

But as he proposes to her, he provokes her so much, that she leaves him. A few days later, Jimmies grandfather (Peter Ustinov) dies. His testament says: Jimmie will heir 100 million - but only if he will find a bride until his 30th birthday. And that´s tomorrow! Time is running!Sometimes everything can go wrong in a romantic- comedy. "Runaway bride" is a good example. Lousy script, no chemistry! A missed chance. But not here! I have really enjoyed "The bachelor". The film has a "rhythm" and the humor is well timed - especially the final scene, when Chris O´Donnell is chased by the brides, was wonderful! SOMETIMES, the supporting actors steal the show - e.g. Peter Ustinov or Brooke Shields, just to mention two of them. But it would be unfair to argue about that - just because Chris O´Donnell and Renée Zellweger are a really sweet couple! A refreshing and VERY charming comedy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three reasons I like this film - O'Donnell, Zellweger, and Shields!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though I'm an older male grandfather with 5 children type of movie watcher, I always enjoy light romantic comedies for almost mindless entertainment, and "The Bachelor" fits the bill nicely. I rate it "7" of 10.Cute story -- wealthy grandfather dies, wills all his wealth to grandson (O'Donnell), $100,000,000. But there is a big catch -- grandson must marry by 6:05PM on his 30th birthday, must stay married for at least 10 years, cannot spend more than one night a month apart from his wife, and must have children. Otherwise, all assets, including the billiards factory, will be sold. A nice comedic touch, the will is delivered by videotape, and Peter Ustinov does a great job. Big problem, though, his 30th birthday is tomorrow!!!Zellweger plays his 3-year girlfriend, and he proposes to her, but she can see in his eyes that he doesn't really want to marry, so she says 'no' and takes off for an assignment in Athens. So, to save the business, and not put 200+ friends and co-workers out of work by the sale of the business, he looks up all his old girlfriends one-by-one and tries to get them to marry him. All answer flatly 'no' except Shields' character. Her family needs an infusion of wealth. The lawyer has told her about the $100million, but gave her other erroneous information about the "deal." At the wedding ceremony, as she finds out each "condition" she pauses the wedding, left eye twitching, steps off to the side and lights up a cigarette to ponder. Each time she stepped back in place to resume the wedding. Until she found out about children. That she couldn't take, and drove off hurriedly.To me, Brooke Shields was the scene-stealer of the whole movie. She did such a perfect job of playing the self-centered, money-grubbing woman that the script demanded. I never knew she was so good.Meanwhile, one of the buddies put an ad in the S.F. paper and hundreds of prospective brides showed up the next afternoon at the church, Saints Peter and Paul. Meanwhile, Zellweger cancelled her trip to Athens, O'Donnell finds out the true meaning of married life by talking to the priest who was married and has a bunch of grandchildren. Zellweger and O'Donnell manage to get together right at 6PM, and exactly at 6:05 the priest, over the cop car speakers, sourrounded by hundreds of prospective brides in the street, pronounces them man and wife.Obviously constructed for a romantic comedy, it contrives several situations, adds gratuitous drama, has a fairy-tale ending, and everyone lives happily ever after. But some times that's just what we need to watch for good, light entertainment. A very lightweight film, acted well, can you tell my wife and I enjoyed it?</fullReview>

Peter Ustinoff is underused, but quite funny and makes the most of his scenes and the last segment with all the brides showing up at the church,chasing him around town then being there as witness to the wedding is a nice piece of writing. One of the best scenes is the one with Brooke Shields. Some very bad continuity problems in the early scene with Mr.Ustinoff - obviously cut down. Got this film as a "gift with purchase" with a bucket of chicken, so no extras except an add for "Elf". A few good laughs out loud here and there but as someone else said a "cute" film.</fullReview>

The movie doesn't falter even for a minute. A flawless screenplay and dialogs make the movie enjoyable. Chris is handsome and Renee is adorable. Every character in the movie has a part to play and every actor has done just to his/her role. There is an interesting cameo appearance by Brooke Shields and she is the perfect choice for that role.

		<fullReview>Chris O'Donnell plays a young handsome man who is (sigh) afraid of getting married. But he's been dating Renee Zellweger for three years and she wants to get married. He tries to propose but fails. Then his obnoxious grandfather dies and leaves him 100 million dollars...IF he gets married before his 30th birthday. But his 30th birthday is one day away, Zellweger has left town and he frantically races around town asking all the women he's dated in the past to marry him.O'Donnell doing comedy was a BAD mistake. For starters he can't act. Also this guy is handsome but he's so bland it's annoying. Doing a remake of Buster Keaton's hilarious classic "Seven Chances" was another stupid mistake. The script is unfunny and full of lines that are just groaners. Old pros Hal Holbrook, Edward Asner and James Cromwell are in this and manage to get a few chuckles despite their lines. The view of women is this film (especially at the end) is deplorable and there's a HUGE amount of swearing for a PG-13 film. Still it DOES have its good points (that's why I'm giving it a 4). O'Donnell's first proposal to Zellweger (and her reaction) is very funny. There's a good cast (save O'Donnell) and Zellweger is just great. There's also a cool soundtrack. Also Brooke Shields (almost unrecognizable) is hysterical in a segment towards the end. But, all in all, this was a REAL unwise career choice for O'Donnell. This movie bombed badly and got O'Donnell some of the worst reviews of his career. Hopefully this will steer him clear of ever trying comedy again. I give this a 4.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jimmie (Chris O'Donnell) has a girlfriend of three years named Anne (Renee Zellweger). It truly is time for him to make a decision on their future so he schedules a dinner at a posh restaurant and buys a ring. However, he bungles the proposal so badly that Anne says no way and decides to go to Greece on a work assignment. Bad timing, this is. That's because Jimmie's grandfather suddenly expires and his will requires Jimmie to be married by his next birthday in order for him to inherit an absolute boat load of money. Got that? The birthday is only a few days away. If Anne is not willing, Jimmie must find another bride or his company and all of its workers will have dismal futures, too. Out comes the old black book. Jimmie pursues his old flames and tries to convince one of them to marry him. One (Brooke Shields) even dons a wedding dress and starts the ceremony only to bolt when she hears the groom wants children. Will no one in the city of San Fran be willing to marry a potential millionaire, and a very cute one at that?This is a charmer of a movie for anyone who delights in a mixture of laughter and love. O'Donnell and Zellweger, two very beautiful people, are wonderful as the on again, off again couple. The script is total fun as, at one point, a church full of women in wedding gowns are waiting to marry Jimmie. The setting and costumes are very worthy indeed, also. This is the movie to whip out when you need a jolt of sunshine on a cloudy day. It has that wonderful quality needed to erase the cares of the world for any viewer, anywhere, anytime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent comedy about a commitment-shy man!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE BACHELOR, in my opinion, is an excellent comedy about a commitment-shy man! If you ask me, Buckley (Brooke Shields) and Daphne (Jennifer Esposito) were absolute snobs! On the other hand, every antic of Jimmie's (Chris O'Donnell) was hilarious. Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say that everyone was ideally cast, the direction was flawless, the production design was spectacular, and the performances were top-grade. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this excellent comedy about a commitment-shy man. I guarantee you you'll enjoy it. Oh, yes, and watch for a special appearance by Mariah Carey as Jimmie's ex-girlfriend, Ilana. She is absolutely fantastic here, albeit the movie and soundtrack don't contain a recording by her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was funny as heck. Especially the part when Jimmie's grandfather makes his rude remarks. The best part of the movie is when after Jimmie's grandfather kick the bucket, his "last will and testament" is videotaped. The part where they pause the video tape right when the grandfather is about to let loose. THat was hilarious!!! ANd you can still see the grandfather on pause in the background while Jimmie and his friends are talking. Hmmm... but other than that, the movie has no "real" plot. SO, i would recommend seeing it, but only for the funny parts. The movie is kinda slow, and doesn't explain certain situations very well. But yeah, rent it and see for yourself!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly delightful romantic comedy about the horrors of marriage!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** I was remarkably uninterested in this movie when I first heard about it. I just can't say that a romantic comedy starring Chris O'Donnell held any appeal for me, and to be perfectly honest, I can't even remember why I decided to watch it. Whatever led me to watch this film, I'm glad, because it was surprisingly amusing. There are certain reasons for watching a romantic comedy, and not all of them have to do with going out on your second date with your high school boyfriend or girlfriend. A good romantic comedy will have a quality romance element that will keep the female audience adequately interested, as well as enough good comedy to keep the attention of those guys who just can't get into the romance even a little bit (oh, shut up, you know you had tears in your eyes). The Wedding Singer is a perfect example of a romantic comedy that fills these requirements in just the right proportions. In the case of The Bachelor, you don't have to be scared away just because Chris O'Donnell belongs in a romantic comedy only slightly more than someone like Jet Li or Steven Seagal does.There is an amusing plot that involves massive amounts of money that will be awarded to Jimmy Shannon (O'Donnell) if he married by his 30th birthday, which is inconveniently the next day. Now, as there are good things that a romantic comedy should strive for, such as all those described above, there are also horribly frustrating things that are unfortunately common in these films. To describe a couple of them stereotypically, there is the aggravatingly stubborn girlfriend, and the boyfriend who turns into a complete moron at just the right (or wrong) times. Jimmy's girlfriend, Anne (Renee Zellweger), knows that Jimmy doesn't want to get married, and therefore makes a big fuss when he wants to get married because of this money. For crying out loud, it's a HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS!! CONVINCE HIM LATER!!! You'd think that she would at least keep the prenuptial agreement in mind before turning him down for being shallow. If anything, she should smack him if he's still hesitant to marry after being promised all this money (in, by the way, an absolutely hilarious video will).But of course, we can't blame everything on the girl, right? Of course not. Jimmy has the unenviable skill of invariably sticking his foot so far in his mouth at just the wrong moment that he'll have to have it surgically removed. He screws up proposal after proposal in the most idiotic ways, challenging the audience to keep from screaming out how stupid it is to daydream about horses on the helipad as he's proposing to Anne (as they say, if you love your freedom, your marriage will fail), or to tell Zoe how far down on the list she is. Thankfully, however, frustrating nonsense like this, although sadly prevalent in the film, is satisfactorily countered by side-splitting comedy, a lot of which is embodied in the grumpy old grandfather with the loudspeaker (`PROCREATE!!'). Other than the bonehead proposals that Jimmy gives to his ex-girlfriends, that part of the film was actually pretty well structured. The only one of them who actually agrees to marry him is pretty good looking but is also a greedy bi*ch. And, as if that weren't bad enough, her name's BUCKley. I don't care how good looking you are, Buckley is the name of a redneck boy. On the other hand, at least she was honest that she was only interested in the marriage as a business arrangement.(spoilers) So as we near the end of the film, it becomes time for the happy ending to develop, so marriage is suddenly made to be a good thing. I think that this is true myself (both of my parents are divorced, but are also each happily re-married), but the institution of marriage is clearly manipulated in this movie in order to further the plot in just the right way. Manipulative, yes, but also not necessarily excessive or even bad. We eventually encounter a happily married priest who calls marriage the best thing that ever happened to him, and this is basically what changes Jimmy's mind about the whole thing, which only leaves the task of finding Anne and getting her to believe that he really wants to marry her and to get the ceremony done in time to get the money promised in his grandfather's hilarious video will. Her train arrives at 5:50, and he has to be married by 6:05. Trains are ALWAYS late, but we'll ignore that for now. This is, of course, the time when he wakes up in church and gets mobbed by eager brides, who all begin spouting criteria at him for some mysterious reason, and then get mad at him for his preferences. He says that he likes blondes, and is ACCUSED by brunettes left and right for it. He should have said, `No bi*ches.'There are some serious logical discrepancies in the final scene, such as the Where's Waldo-like scene of the brides mobbing the police car but parting calmly for Anne to pass through, as well as the fact that they all quiet down immediately when Anne's sister tells them to. There is a cheesy cutesy scene when Anne asks if this can please be her day, the crowd of angry brides mysteriously applauds when they are pronounced man and wife, and then the fat guy announces `Cake for everybody!' which leaves us to wonder how they are to provide cake for everyone in that crowd when the cakes cost $800 each. Obviously not perfect, but as a whole, the film is entertaining and amusing, despite a lot of cheesy garbage, and it can be enjoyed for that. It didn't start out with a lot of promise, but I think that the movie came through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Bachelor is....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is very worth watching. This is what I thought about the movie. Chris O'donnell is a good actor and he other protagonists are good as well. I also like the jokes and humors in the movie. They make me laugh...Chris O'donnell is not so famous in Japan, which always disappoints me. I guess I should recommend this movie to my Japanese friends.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a piece of my good mind about it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The plot is not exactly original, but the movie itself is great. It combines comedy with a real life problem. The thing I like the best about it is that it`s focusing on the idea men have about the great step between being single and married; going through metaphors such as "mustangs looking for grass"; or screwing his engagement with "shit or get off the pot". It`s a fun movie and I definitively recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Best Movies of Alltime!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an avid movie goer and I just saw " The Bachelor " and now I have a new inductee into my top ten movies of all time. " The Bachelor " has a great cast Chris O'Donnell (Batman &amp; Robin) is great in this character he was perfect for the role. Also there is Renee Zellwegger ( Jerry Maguire ) she is excellent this is one of her best performances of her career in my opinion. Also Brooke Shields ( Suddenly Susan ) and Mariah Carey ( Recent CD- Rainbow ) gave superb supporting roles in this movie. I would definitely recommend " The Bachelor " to everyone. In conclusion Go See It !!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is pivotal for Mariah. The plot is witty and charming and the cast is awesome. Unfortunately, she wasn't selected for the main role but it's still exciting to see her on the big screen. Thumbs up! Good luck Mariah!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost Certainly The Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I hate myself for wasting an hour and a half sitting through it. You women, how can you not be INCANDESCENT with rage about this offensive tripe?? Or is it accurate in its summation of you all as man-hungry, marriage-desperate, money-grubbing harridans?When all the brides are gathered, did you notice that none of them are "classically" attractive? Ugly, old, butch, fat...you name it, all of Womankind's flaws were represented. This smug film assumed that thousands of women would WANT to marry a bland cypher like O'Donnell, even with all his millions (Brooke Shields didn't).Even disregarding the misogynist seam running through this grotty project like an open sewer, it irritates beyond belief by cramming every cliche you can think of into it's century and a half. Do you REALLY want another story with the Fat Funny Friend? He's here - and he swears amusingly at other motorists! Oh, and what's this - when the girls are depressed they curl up in their pyjamas on the couch with huge bags of potato chips!What on earth is Ed Asner doing in this? Hal Holbrook totally undoes a lifetime's work with an UNFUNNY turn as a "quirky" old man (hey, he wears a flat cap!) Guys, stand on the street with a sign saying "Will Dance For Food" around your necks - it's more dignified!To mention this in the same breath as Buster Keaton is like calling Police Academy a remake of Electra Glide In Blue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Insight as to what American men want is represented in his perspective choices</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My favorite quote in this movie is when a hispanic woman asks The Bachelor if latinas are acceptable to him and he says "I'm sorry....you have to be able to speak English". It's fascinating how the writer of this movie managed to represent a good number of the female characteristics that an American man finds unappealing, as thru the course of the movie he approaches some of his past girlfriends to propose to them, and you see for yourself what a pain in the *ss they are! ;) The butch police woman, the stuck up and cold socialite, the feminist college student, the clinging vine, the "totally into her job, ignoring her man" stock exchange woman, the prima donna opera singer. Perhaps I liked the movie because it made me feel smug afterwards. I came out smelling like a rose!!!! LOL</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Reviewed By Matt Doolittle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Bachelor"1999Starring: Chris O'Donnell, Renée Zellweger, James Cromwell, Hal Holbrook, and Brooke ShieldsDirectors: Buster Keatonand Gary Sinyor Running time: 101 minutes Rated PG-13 (for language and some sex-related material) 1/2* 2 out of 10Reviewed By Matt DoolittleThe Bachelor was a cheap imitation of a comedy that was ongoing and boring. It wasn't boring in a sense of nothing there; it was boring in a sense that you didn't know what was going on. The characters were never introduced and the plot was very uneasy because they weren't introduced.  About the plot, it was uneasy because the film had no emotion. The actors/actresses said their lines with no charisma. They basically had a script and read it. In a good movie you can't do that, if you want viewers to like it they have to feel it. I think "Buckley" (played by Brook Shields) was a very good character. It's sad when the supporting roles are played better than the main ones. As a viewer I didn't know the names of characters and I didn't care enough to know. This whole movie is supposed to take place in two days but within two days Anne goes to Athens and back then goes away again with her sister. He asks 16 people to marry him in a matter of a couple hours. Mariah Carey really messed up upon taking the role of one of the woman. She had no personality or a sense of character at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>very cute movie, great remake of the old classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Bachelor is very cute, Chris O'Donnell is very good in it. I've seen the old silent this is a remake of, "Seven Chances" starring Buster Keaton, it is very funny, and one of Buster's best, i never thought anyone would be interested in remaking it, but I'm glad they did. Renee Zellweger is also good in it, she makes The Bachelor worth watching. She is very pretty and believable as O'Donnell's girlfriend. The movie gets a little slow sometimes, but recovers afterward. there is an all star cast, i couldn't believe there were so many stars in it. All of O'Donnell's old girlfriends are really funny (the cop, opera singer, student, cook, stock broker, Buckley and Zoey.) So overall The Bachelor was an almost perfect movie.</fullReview>
