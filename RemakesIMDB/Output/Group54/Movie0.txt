		<shortDescription>Hard To Top This For Silent Film Laughs</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton, a businessman who is about to get into some serious trouble and lose all his money, finds out his fortunes might change rapidly as a relative dies and leaves him $7 million. One hitch: he has to be married by his 27th birthday to qualify for the cash....and - surprise - today is his 27th birthday.Well, he frantically searches for anyone to marry him, starting with his girlfriend and then working down to others. He has a list of seven women - all very pretty, I might add, even with that stupid 1920s overdone makeup. Poor Buster quickly strikes out on all seven of those.Then - and here is where the real fun starts - his business partner puts a story in that day's newspaper saying his buddy is looking to marry a woman and collect $7 million. All you have to do is meet him at the church at 5 o'clock to marry him. Well, hundreds - maybe a thousand - women all storm the church! When Buster sees this - and then gets a note from his girlfriend saying she WILL marry him - he escapes from the church to meet her. Unfortunately, the chase is on as the multitude of women chase him all over town. The hordes of women pursue him the main street, through a railroad yard, past the suburbs and finally into the countryside where he loses them. He still isn't home free as giant boulders start chasing him down a hill and then chase him for miles. Keaton keeps running and running through all of it. He has more endurance than an Olympic marathon runner! It's touch-and-go whether he can make it to see his girl by the 7 p.m. deadline and get married. All of this takes place in a 56-minute film with the last 15 minutes being total insanity with that great chase scene. Silent movie comedy entertainment.does not get much better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific introduction for those new to Keaton</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Contrary to what you may have read, "Seven Chances" (1925) was made before Buster Keaton signed with MGM and relinquished artistic control over his own films. His gifts of extraordinary agility, timing, and visualizing the comic potential in the most mundane situations are everywhere in evidence.The plot of "Seven Chances" is ancient. A young bachelor stands to inherit millions if he can find a bride by a certain day and marry at a certain hour. The date is invariably the same as the day the will is read, and in the hands of Keaton, his writers and cast, the comic possibilities are brilliantly exploited. The same premise was the basis for at least three other films before Keaton's, and was remade (abysmally -- from what I've read) as "The Bachelor" with Chris O'Donnell in 1999. The chain of events that flows from news of the inheritance just builds and builds over the course of the film, the gags growing increasingly clever as time grows shorter. "Seven Chances" clocks in at less than an hour, but the final 15 minutes (which Buster Keaton reportedly reworked several times) are among the most hilarious in all of silent film, perhaps in the history of screen comedy.Initially, only Buster, his business partner (T. Ray Brown) and the lawyer (Snitz Edwards, who was so terribly homely he was cute) are aware of the dilemma. After Buster botches a proposal to his longtime girlfriend, (Ruth Dwyer), he pops the question to several more female acquaintances, with predictably embarrassing results. It is then that Brown and Edwards (unbeknownst to Buster) decide to place a newspaper announcement advertising his plight.Once the newspapers hit the streets, the chase is on. Keaton is pursued through 1920s Los Angeles by dozens, then scores, then seemingly hundreds of would-be brides. They come in all ages, shapes and sizes, makeshift veils trailing after them. No obstacle is too great in their pursuit to beat out each other for the prize of marriage to a man they don't even know, and Buster throws out plenty of roadblocks in his wake.In 1979, Walter Kerr wrote the definitive book on silent comedies, "The Silent Clowns." One of the jacket blurbs reads, "I found myself laughing out loud at routines from movies I have never seen." I don't have Kerr's gift, but I can tell you that "Seven Chances" is the most consistently funny movie Buster Keaton ever made. All of his movies include inventive sight gags, but "Seven Chances," more than most of Buster's movies, relies on character comedy as well as situational comedy for its humor. And it scores a bull's eye on both. A sheer delight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film might seem familiar, as it has been remade several times--the last time just a few years ago. Buster Keaton stands to inherit a fortune providing he marries before time expires. But, he has no prospects and time is running out--what to do, what to do? Well, he tries again and again and again with no luck. That is until the ladies find out about the fortune that awaits them as his bride. Then, EVERYONE under the sun comes out of the woodwork--all ages, races and sizes. And, because so much money is involved, it goes from being a cute comedy to complete pandemonium! These women WON'T take no for an answer and they are super-dooper aggressive--and Buster runs for his life! Well, the ladies aren't about to let their fortune get away and hundreds of maniacal brides-to-be (all in white) give chase--resulting in one of the funniest chases in film history. What happens next is for you to see for yourself. It's funny, well-made and fast paced fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's comic genius makes "Seven Chances" a wildly entertaining film. The first half of it is quite good, if imperfect, but the second half is a tour-de-force of sustained humor and creativity. Keaton plays Jimmie Shannon, a young man who learns that he stands to inherit a fortune, but only if he marries by 7 PM that very day. It's the kind of goofy premise that in lesser hands could be a complete flop, but Keaton gets all kinds of possibilities out of it.For most of the first half of the film, Jimmie is busy racing around proposing to every woman he can find. His true love, Mary, tries to find Jimmie herself, but he is already off on his frantic search for someone to accompany him to the altar. The search is always funny, at times extremely so. This first half has a handful of things that don't quite work, such as the black-faced servant (who was, though, probably intended as a sympathetic character), but if it were not for that and a couple other small details, this would be a nearly perfect film.In the second half, all of the complications set up a frantic chase sequence, with literally hundreds (at least) of angry women pursuing Jimmie through the city, while he tries to get to Mary. This might be the best comic chase sequence ever filmed. It is hilarious and incredibly inventive, with careful choreography, a great variety of backgrounds, and a huge collection of gags both obvious and subtle. No description could do it justice - it has to be seen at least once to appreciate it.If you are a fan of Keaton or of silent films in general, make sure to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Seven laughs a minute!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton catapults himself down a steep hillside, an avalanche of pebbles, rocks and boulders tumbling in his wake. If any one of these objects were to strike him down, he would certainly be killed by the impact. He is almost escaping the rocks now; just a few more seconds of frantic sprinting is required. Suddenly, Keaton looks up, only to find a massive horde of woman striding purposefully towards him. He is stuck between a rock and a hard place: an avalanche behind him, and a flock of would-be brides ahead. Quickly and delicately weighing his chances of survival either way, Keaton turns determinedly towards the barrage of boulders. It is hilarious little moments like this that make Buster Keaton's silent comedies such a joy to watch, and 'Seven Chances' is certainly one of the funniest I've seen, brimming with the talented actor's trademark deadpan humour.The premise on which the story is based is singularly ridiculous, and so this allows Keaton to have a great deal of fun, placing his character in appropriately bizarre situations. Young Jimmy Shannon (Keaton) loves his sweetheart Mary Jones (Ruth Dwyer), but can never quite muster up the courage to tell her, and most certainly could never take that plunge into marriage. However, one day he discovers that his grandfather has left him the princely sum of $7 million, but only if he gets married? by 7 PM that day! After he is rejected by Mary (due to an unfortunate misunderstanding), Jimmy seeks out another would-be bride, ultimately realising that finding a wife isn't as easy as he had hoped. The first half of the film is admittedly light on Keaton's patented stunt-work, but it remains a clever and witty situation comedy, with poor Jimmy suffering the laughter of onlookers as he moves from one girl to the next, tentatively asking for their hands in marriage.When all this fails, an advertisement in the afternoon-edition newspaper brings hundreds of women to Jimmy's side, but by now he's realised that Mary is the only girl he could ever marry. As he struggles desperately to get to her home by 7:00, he is pursued by a horde of money-crazy ladies: big and small, young and old, beautiful and ugly. This is truly where Keaton comes into his element, and a hectic scramble down a hillside ? pursued by an avalanche of rocks ? is the film's most memorable moment {the idea for this scene came by accident, when Keaton inadvertently dislodged some rocks while he was running. The preview audience responded so favourably that he decided to re-shoot an extended sequence}. The paper-mâché rocks look quite convincing, and I was pretty much fooled into thinking that Keaten was really dodging the real thing (until I noticed him get bowled over by one of the boulders, without any apparent ill-effects!) 'Seven Chances' moves by at such a frenetic pace that there isn't a moment that could be trimmed. Though it runs for just 56 minutes, I had a huge smile on my face for every single one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster's Biggest Crowd Pleaser</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Chances is one of Buster Keaton's comedic masterpieces from the mid-1920's. It has been beautifully restored by Kino for both the VHS and DVD versions, with a lovely compilation of an attractive musical score by Robert Israel; a technicolor beginning, and tints. A most enjoyable film, and worth every dime if you buy it. Look for a young, pert Jean Arthur in a bit part as the secretary, without her customary blond curls.Jimmie (Buster Keaton) is a young stockbroker who has gotten into financial difficulties with his partner Billy. When Jimmie learns a rich grandfather has died and left him 7 million dollars in his will it looks like Jimmie's troubles may be over. But there is a catch: Jimmie must marry by 7pm on the evening of his 27th birthday, which is the same day he is notified of the possible windfall. He asks his girlfriend Mary to marry him, and she says yes, but then he bungles the proposal when he tells her the reason why he must marry her "today". No girl likes to think she is being married just to obtain a fortune, and Mary spurns Jimmie.This leads to Jimmie's partner Billy convincing him he must marry "some girl", since he owes it to their friendship and partnership to obtain the money to salvage their business. The madness then ensues, where Jimmie proposes to every female in sight, including famous female impersonator Julian Eltinge. The second half of the film is Buster's brainchild entirely, and will have you laughing non-stop, as Jimmie escapes the wrath of an entire city of thwarted brides, who all wanted a shot at his 7 million and were denied. The most famous shots are the running-down-the-mountains-with-the-boulders-chasing-you scenes, invented by Buster, but there are many other deliciously funny moments as well, and a suitable, happy ending, complete with a Dalmation's kisses.See Seven Chances before you pass on. You owe it to yourself. :)One final note: a previous commentator here wrote that Buster did not care for his Seven Chances. That is not quite true. The business situation surrounding the planning of the film did not suit him, since the vehicle was chosen for him by Joseph Schenck, and he preferred to do his own material, but Buster did have creative control over the 2nd half of the film, and it shows. When the film was restored and re-shown starting in the 1960's, before his death, Buster Keaton was able to realize how much of a crowd pleaser this film was, and he changed his mind about it. If you are a student of the 1920's and love comedy, you will find lots to love in Seven Chances. It's sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exhilarating comedy jewel from silent era genius</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love Seven Chances as much if not more than any of Keaton's other features, even if it does not enjoy the same reputation as The General or Sherlock, Jr. Using the sure-fire concept of a man who must take a wife or lose a fortune, Buster builds and executes one of his greatest extended gag sequences -- the chase of the reluctant groom by the army of brides. The first sections of the film detail Buster's inability to get anyone to take his proposal of marriage seriously, and then Buster pulls out all the stops on the famine to feast prospect once scores of women of all shapes and sizes begin to hunt down our hero while dressed in their wedding gowns. Seven Chances completely capitalizes on its comic potential, and Buster offers up another unbelievable tour de force of superb movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Keaton's top three comedy features</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Keaton's absolute best comedies and a superb example of clever invention -in narrative, in gag development, and in the use of composition and editing to achieve comedic effects. Among the unforgettable moments are: The trip from the country club to his sweetheart's home and back by hopping in a car and letting the backgrounds dissolve.The marriage proposal response from the balcony of the country club.The stairway proposal - one going up and one coming down.The hatcheck girl's response to her proposal. Jean Arthur's bit part as "Miss Smith." The proposal while driving and the resultant encounter with a tree.The ethnic mistake. The barber with the dummy heads. The Julian Eltinge error. The race of expectant brides to reach the church.The clocks in a shop window of different times.The ladies' absorption of the bricks.The football field invasion.The turtle on Buster's tie.The entire twenty minute concluding chase, especially with the onslaught of the rocks.Kino's print is the best of all the Keaton films they have released-crisp, clear, sharp and flawless. This Metro-Goldwyn feature only lasts for 56 minutes but it seems to whiz by in even shorter time than that. The score is one for violin,piano and drums. Although much is made of the short opening two-strip Technicolor scenes- four of them - in this print it is a red wash- no color at all. The rest of the film is beautifully tinted.Don't miss this one - a great great comedy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had never seen a Buster Keaton movie before this one; now, I only wish I hadn't missed so much of the local Keaton film fest. This film was unlike anything I'd ever seen before -- a jaw-dropping of hilarity and acrobatic skill. You want to sit there, stunned at the stunts Buster pulls, but it's so hilarious, you absolutely can't stop laughing. It's simply a good movie for about 45 minutes; then, the last 15 are incomparable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Chances (1925) **** (out of 4) Buster Keaton's greatest comedy is also one of the greatest comedies ever made. This film has huge laughs, one of the greatest chases ever not to mention some of the greatest stunts ever captured on film. In the movie Keaton plays a shy fellow who can't build up the nerve to tell his girlfriend that he loves her. He gets a letter stating that he will inherit seven million dollars if he gets married before seven that evening but there's a mix up between him and the girlfriend but the biggest problem is that every other woman is willing to marry him for the money. I had forgotten what a wonderful gem this film is but I was laughing harder and more often than any other film that comes to my mind. I'm not sure where to start with the laughs because each scene contains one and the majority of the scenes contain multiple laughs. The film's 56-minute running time feels like the matter of seconds because everything is just happening so incredibly fast. There are three great things about this film but I'll start with the laughs. I might go as far as to say that there isn't a joke in the film that doesn't work. The wonderful moments inside the country club where Keaton tries to find a wife, the politically incorrect joke of Keaton accidentally asking a little girl to marry him, the racial joke of Keaton almost asking a black woman to marry him and of course the wonderful gag with the dummy in the barber chair. That's just to name a few because there are at least a hundred other jokes. The second brilliant thing about the film is the fact that Keaton hired hundreds (if not over a thousand) women to chase him when they discover he will inherit millions. The scene inside the church with all these women trying to pile in is just something incredible on the eyes. This stunt leads to the third masterpiece of this film and that's the final twenty minutes where these hundreds of women chase Keaton either trying to marry him or kill him. Anyone who knows anything about Keaton knows that he would put his life at risk to pull off a stunt and there are at least eight different stunts here that could have or even should have killed him. Watching him perform these stunts is truly breathtaking and him running into the barbed wire is also quite painful. Oh yeah, Snitz Edwards is brilliant as the lawyer and you've also got Jean Arthur in an early performance. Certainly one of the all time greats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster's unique talents are in evidence once more in this one-of-a-kind romantic comedy. If our hero marries by 7pm, he inherits $7 million, but in proposing to the love of his life, manages to mortally offend her. What to do? Easy: T. Roy Barnes places an advert in the newspaper, highlighting his friend's plight, which naturally leads to Buster being chased by thousands of women whilst he tries to avoid enormous boulders! The stuntwork in this film is utterly astonishing, as the director/star risks life and limb to create another comedic masterpiece.Flawlessly paced, and mixing farce and stuntwork as adeptly as ever, Buster Keaton's Seven Chances is a joy to behold.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Seven Chances" is by far Buster 'Stoneface' Keaton's greatest film in a whole bunch of very funny films he acted and directed in the silent era. The idea is funny enough in itself. By the time Buster gets to the church early, till when he falls asleep, then wakes up to discover the church overflowing with womenwanting to marry him, and the chase that follows (with all these women in their bridal dresses), is THE funniest sequence ever put to film. I laughed so hard, it hurt. Even later, at home, images from the film would come to mind, and I'd be off again. They say Chaplin is a comic genius.

		<fullReview>Desperate for money to save his failing business, junior stockbroker Buster Keaton (as James "Jimmie" Shannon) is understandably pleased to learn his recently deceased grandfather has tentatively left him $7 million. In order to inherit the money, Mr. Keaton must get married by 7 pm. After a misunderstanding with girlfriend Ruth Dwyer (as Mary Jones), Keaton gets "Seven Chances" to propose, but each woman turns him down. When a newspaper article reveals Keaton's potential, every woman in the vicinity decides to pursue him. Keaton decides marrying Ms. Dwyer is the correct way to go, if he can get away from a landslide of eager women...Lost on modern audiences is a moment when Keaton visits a theater to propose marriage to a showgirl, who we're told is Julian Eltinge; filmgoers in 1925 would have known this was a female impersonator. Another of Keaton's prospects in young Jean Arthur (as "Miss Smith"). The colorful opening gives "Seven Chances" a great start, but frequent "ethnic" humor is not funny. It's hard to believe Keaton considered this film substandard. Even before it gets going, it's a top quality production. There are enough chuckles before the famous chase scene, which really begins when Keaton falls asleep in church and the women start rushing to meet him.******** Seven Chances (3/11/25) Buster Keaton ~ Buster Keaton, Ruth Dwyer, Snitz Edwards, T.

		<fullReview>What's worse than being a girl having to fight off 1,000 other possible brides for a chance to marry a millionaire? Hearing the minister later tell all of you ladies to leave the church quietly, that this whole thing must've been a prank! *YIKES!*One of THE funniest movies I've ever seen, especially the famous climactic chase scene. While I loved how "College" showed off some of Buster's many athletic skills, I think this one actually shows them just as well if not better. Great how all those boulders chased off the rabid pack of brides, too - I'll bet even "Jimmie" the groom had to laugh to himself about that. ;-D Some reviewers felt it started off rather slow, which it did, but when Buster made a film HIS way, this was usually the case - build, build, and build then push 'em out into the aisles laughing! Oh, and throw in some great sight gags along the way: the scene in the clock shop was priceless! I was surprised to learn that this was one of Buster's least favorite films, but despite that, being forced on him by Joe Schenck, I think he took a weak pitch and knocked it 'way out of the ballpark! Keaton + sow's ear = silk purse.MY, what a rare mix of talent Buster had! He was a prize stallion that should've ran free forever, and never should have been fenced in at the Malicious Greedy Morons studio. I'm so glad in his later years, he was vindicated as a wonderful comedic genius, loved and revered by millions everywhere for all time. :-)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>anxiety (and laughs) at the altar</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A young businessman in financial trouble learns he can inherit a fortune if he marries by 7 p.m. on his 27th birthday, giving him scant hours to find a willing candidate after his fiancé rejects what she considers a purely mercenary proposal. Silent clown Buster Keaton was working from someone else's (contrived) idea, originally a failed Broadway play, and despite the exquisite timing to some of the gags the source material never measured up to Keaton's usual high standards of comedy (even his character is atypically bland: a wealthy, conventional role better suited to Harold Lloyd). Only after he wakes up in a chapel surrounded by a bloodthirsty mob of would-be wives do Keaton's unerring comic instincts kick in, and the rousing climactic chase down a hillside strewn with falling boulders would have to rank among the funniest sequences he ever devised; never has one man's instinctive, unconscious dread of matrimony been so hilariously exposed.Note: before the advent of DVD technology the film was rarely revived (surviving prints included an odd, tinted prologue subtitled in French), but even minor Keaton is in a class all its own.</fullReview>

And then when he does hear the good news, there's a catch...Directed by and starring Buster Keaton, this film portrays his particular brand of physical comedy, though perhaps not with as much danger as "The General" or as many tricks as "Sherlock Jr." The music of Robert Israel really carries this film. Not just because it's a silent film, but because it's great music -- moving, light and comedic. And there is an implied racial tone... Jimmie passes on proposing to both a Jew and a black woman.I literally "laughed out loud" at this film! It is a shame Keaton considered it his worst film. Who knew it was so hard to get someone to marry you for $7,000,000 (in 1925 money, no less)?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Buster Keaton's films were usually a mix of misunderstandings, stunts, and convoluted plots, and 'Seven Chances' is no exception. Our hero is the partner in a failing company heading for financial ruin and disgrace, but there may be a way out if he can marry before 7pm on his 27th birthday - the trouble is, that's today ...Cue some attempts to entice a variety of ladies into matrimony (the 'seven chances' of the title), as well as a lovely sequence in a church which slowly fills with brides in various types of dresses and veils. The chase which ensues involves Buster running away from rocks rolling down a hill in a race to reach his true love's door in time - but will he make it? Played very well and extremely clever in the way the stunts are carried out and filmed (no regard for health and safety here!), 'Seven Chances' has a lot to recommend it. As usual, Buster remains impassive throughout, no matter what happens - a gimmick which works well. This is one of his best films and well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hell hath no fury like a woman scorned!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the hit Broadway show by David Belasco and foisted upon him by his longtime collaborator and producer John M. Schenck, Buster Keaton regarded Seven Chances as his least favourite of his films, so much so that he tried to prevent a restoration from the one known copy. This is all considerably surprising and perhaps indicative of the professionalism the former vaudeville daredevil regarded his film work with, that despite his personal disaffection for the project, Buster Keaton turned it into a bonafide classic so very representative of his work. The basic story of a young man who must get married by seven o'clock that afternoon in order to inherit a vast fortune left to him by his deceased grandfather, becomes a setup, as Keaton tries his luck proposing to "anything that wears a skirt, including a Scotchman", for a huge uproarious chase scene in the second half on roads, mountains, land and water. Keaton being chased by an irate throng of brides through city streets and countryside is as iconic an image as Keaton being chased by the swarm of cops in his one-reeler Cops while many of the pratfalls and visual gags recall the breathtaking daring-do and ingenuity of his earlier SHERLOCK JR.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a really sweet little Buster Keaton movie, with a greatly executed story.Its story is fun enough to make the movie consistently a fun one. It's the sort of story that has copied a lot in movies ever since but also was used in movies before this one. It's even a popular subject for modern present day comedies. It perhaps makes "Seven Chances" seem less original than it in fact truly is of course.The movie uses a lot of title cards. I mean, basically every line that gets spoken in the movie gets shown in a title card. It also makes the dialog part of the comedy of the movie. It isn't a much visual comedy, meaning that it doesn't really feature much slapstick or things like that. It's more a movie that relies on its comical situations and of course on the acting comical talent of Buster Keaton. Also the supporting cast is really more than great.The movie begins a bit standard and perhaps even a bit slow but when the movie its story starts to take form the movie turns into one great laugh fest, with the last 20 minutes or so as the ultimate highlight, when things start to get really crazy and paced and the movie gets turned into one big non-stop comical chase! It's the one great fun moment after the other, with also some great and dangerous stunt work again from Buster Keaton himself!A great Buster Keaton must-see, from the silent-era!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brides and more brides</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Buster Keaton stars in one of his best silent features as a businessman who must marry by 7 PM to inherit $7M. The trouble is he has trouble committing.The story is preface by showing his lingering engagement to a girl (Ruth Dwyer) but nothing ever happens. He races to her house to finally pop the question (and inherit the money) but he blurts out nonsense and she says no.So with partner and lawyer in tow (T. Roy Barnes and Snitz Edwards) they go to the country club where Buster sees 7 women he knows. They all say no. So Barnes takes out an ad in the paper; this attracts every woman in town.The scene is brilliantly set up with Buster falling asleep at the church while the scenes cut back to the oncoming brides, first just one here and one there, and then HORDES of brides coming from every direction. Keaton wakes up in church and spies the hundreds of rides. He runs away with hundreds upon hundreds of brides in full chase.No one could run like Keaton and he takes full advantage of his athleticism here as he races across the city to Dwyer's house with the brides in pursuit. Nothing can resist the forces of the pack of brides, all done up in makeshift veils and hats. They plow down a college football team, leaving the boys trampled. Next they disperse a squad of cops who run for their lives from the horde.Finally Buster is running down a hill in a famous sequence in which the boulders start to avalanche down after him. They get bigger and bigger as they cascade down after him. At the bottom of the hill awaits a pack of brides but they are chased off by the boulders.Buster finally makes it to Dwyer's house but the time seems to be up.....Hilarious film and one of my favorite silent comedies. The sight of the city streets teaming with bride is just too funny. They come in all ages and shapes and sizes and colors and most of them are actually men but it is just one of the great sight gags of all time.Jean Arthur plays the office operator. Louise Carver is the lead bride. And Constance Talmadge has a cameo but I didn't spot her.The copy I have starts out with a red-tinted scene and then turns to a beautiful crisp and clear sepia color. Great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seven Chances is a true testament to the genuis of Buster Keaton. It is a wonderful display of all his talents. The fact that he performed his own stunts makes some of the scenes not only funny but also extraordinary. His unique blend of comedy, timing, and innocence has never come together so well. If you have never before seen one of his films than I highly recommend this one, if you have seen this film then I recommend that you see it again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite Buster Keaton film. Here's why....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While Chaplin went for the more human side of comedy, Keaton went for the outright surreal. The image from this film that will stay with you forever is Buster Keaton being chased through the streets by a large angry mob of brides. It seems he's an heir to a $7 million dollar fortune. He can only obtain this if he is married by 7 pm that same day. His efforts to find a willing bride results in ridicule, a car wreck, etc. He finally puts an ad in the paper, telling the circumstances, and asking for the applying bride to meet him at the church. At least a thousand women ranging from fat, small, young, old, beautiful, downright mis-shapen arrive at the church. However, he learns his lost love forgives him and wishes to marry him. He abandons the mob. The mob turns hostile..... A very funny silent movie that moves at atomic pace. My favorite Buster Keaton film. Kino-International Video releases a gorgeous copy with the opening two-strip Technicolor scene intact.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gargantuan Laughs. Another Keaton Masterpiece.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Chances tells the story of a man who along with his partner is in financial trouble. Suddenly, he finds out that his grandfather has left him 7 million dollars, but there's one catch, he has to be married by 7 P.M. today.Buster Keaton was we all probably know was a master of cinema, especially when it came to comedy. What's ingenious about this, is that the idea of this movie originally came from a failed Broadway show. Basically, Keaton took the idea from a failed Broadway show and turns it into the level of a masterpiece of comedy, and that is definitely what we've got here ladies and gentlemen, a masterpiece of comedy. Seven Chances has gargantuan laughs, especially in the last 15 minutes of the movie where the laughs fall left and right like dominoes, one right after another. Seeing Buster Keaton get into predicaments and then try to get out of them has always been fun to watch, and this movie is definite proof of that, as throughout the course of this movie, we see Keaton getting into trouble, but and having an even harder time at trying to get out of it, which is something that would appear in many of his movies, although he somehow manages to overcome those challenges and succeed in the end.Like I said, this movie has a very large amount of laughs in this movie, and when the laughs do occur, they are absolutely gargantuan. Throughout most of the movie, Keaton spends his time being down on his luck about getting married to get the money that he has coming to him, but in the last 15 minutes, things really begin to spiral out of control. Eventually, word spreads, and a large parade of women who want the money come after him, and a climatic chase ensues, which ends with an avalanche of boulders along the hills of Los Angeles. Those scenes had me on the floor laughing, how did Keaton come up with something as ingenious and hilarious as this? And even more so, how he could take a failed Broadway show and turn it into a comedic masterpiece is even more ingenious. In short, Keaton has done it again and has perfected another comedic marvel of a film.Bottom line, if you are into comedies, as well as silent movies, and you have around an hour or so of time to kill, then watching Seven Chances will definitely be your best bet of a movie. All I can say about this is that when you watch this movie, you had better be prepared to laugh, as there are a very large amount of laughs all throughout the course of this movie. In a little under an hour, you will probably laugh more than you did at some of the modern comedies of today. If by some miracle Buster Keaton was still alive today, I would definitely go right up to him and thank him so much for making me laugh heavily with all of his ingenious works of art, this one included.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love For Sale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>True love takes a lot of work - but this is ridiculous!Jimmie Shannon (Buster Keaton) is a partner in a brokerage who can't quite bring himself to propose to Mary (Ruth Dwyer), the only woman he loves. Then, his business facing ruin, he discovers he stands to inherit a fortune if only he gets married that day. He proposes to Mary, but she's put off by his apparent insincerity. So Jimmie is left to find a woman, any woman, who will marry him. Will love prevail?The film is an odd one for Keaton, starting off with a brief color sequence (in 1925) and moving quite slowly for Buster through the first third. The story was one Keaton had handed to him, rather than one he worked on himself, and feels at times like a "ladies' picture," focusing as it does on Jimmie's frustrated feelings and Mary's unhappiness.For a while, Buster's not even the main laugh-getter in the film. For a while, he plays a kind of straight man to troll-visaged Snitz Edwards, playing the lawyer bringing the news of Jimmie's inheritance. Snitz chases after Jimmie and his partner, who think he's a process-server and dodge him, but Snitz prevails. Buster still pines for Mary, saying he can love no other woman (which she happens to hear over a telephone connection, changing her mind), but agrees to bring to bring a woman to church before the deadline out of loyalty to his partner."In case two show up, I'll marry the other," Snitz declares.There are other oddities about "Seven Chances," like racial humor (Jimmie almost proposes to a black woman; a blackface actor plays a thick-headed hired hand) and the "Saphead"-style character Buster plays. It would seem like a lesser Keaton for that, but instead emerges as a masterwork of pacing and narrative. Just as you begin to settle in to "Seven Chances" tea-cozy aesthetic, it ramps things up for one of the great double-rally endings in movie history.There's also a charming sequence where Jimmie tries to find a bride among a list of female members of his country club, the "seven chances" of the film's title. He burns through those chances in six minutes, and then gets rejected by a receptionist (Jean Arthur) and a hat-check girl (Rosalind Byrne) for good measure. The sequence plays with set design and framing to keep you always wondering as to what will happen next.One amazing thing about the film you might not notice is the clever use of panning. Camera pans were still fairly new in cinema; framing was often stationary. But Buster is always in motion, and the camera moves with him. One clever shot, of Buster finding a turtle attached to his tie, apparently employs a treadmill in order to achieve an overhead camera angle.The gags here keep coming, and give "Seven Chances" the feel of a classic Keaton short. Except there's a real story here to be told, and the humor always works to move the ideas forward. It's a classic demonstration of Keaton's ingenuity - even if he didn't have a hand in the film's conception or writing he directed it, and it shows - as well as his ability to find as many ways of making you laugh in as little time as possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film must have inspired many of the comedies that we see today. The premise is simple, the humor ingenious and the pace more hectic than Armageddon. Perhaps Spielberg or Lucas saw this in film school and that was the birth of the famous boulder which chases Indiana Jones in RotLA. Brewster's Millions is strongly reminiscent of it. In short it is a seminal comedy which deserves to be better known than it is today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Near Keaton Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Seven Chances" contains one of the best and funniest chase sequences ever filmed. Having said that, the film does have some flaws.Beginning with the prologue filmed in two strip Technicolor, which I think was put in there more as a novelty because it serves no useful purpose in respect of the story. All the scenes are filmed at seasonal intervals where Buster Keaton is shown with his leading lady Ruth Dwyer in front of her house, afraid to express his love for her. The early part of the film kind of drags as Buster learns of his inheritance and begins his search for a bride.The story has Financial broker James Shannon (Keaton) and his partner (T. Roy Barnes) whose firm is on the brink of ruin, receiving news of Shannon's inheritance of seven million dollars from the estate of Shannon's grandfather. The news is delivered by the family lawyer (Snitz Edwards). The only proviso is that Shannon must be married by 7PM that very day.First Shannon unsuccessfully proposes to his girl friend Mary Jones (Dwyer). Next the trio (Keaton, Barnes and Edwards) visit their country club where they draft a list of seven (i.e. chances) women that Shannon could ask to marry. Naturally all turn him down unaware of the potential fortune awaiting them.The partner and the lawyer hit upon the idea of advertising for a wife for Shannon in the afternoon newspaper. Then the fun begins. Hordes of prospective brides show up at the church, Shannon flees and................................................The chase sequences at the climax of the film have become legendary. First the brides (where did Keaton get all those extras?) pursue him through the streets of 1925 Los Angeles then Buster accidentally starts a rock slide forcing him to try to outrun the falling rocks. I don't know how fast Buster could run but these scenes are expertly choreographed and are a highlight of Keaton's career. He also manages to throw in an array of patented Keaton sight gags and pratfalls, particularly in the climatic scenes.Highly recommended, particularly for the final third of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Probably his best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how I always managed to be impressed by Buster Keaton's movies. This is a wonderfully hilarious movie because everything escalates in the craziest ways imaginable. A lot of it doesn't make sense, but it's way too entertaining to even care. The best part is easily the massive chase scene at the end. It's simply great to see how much this goes on and how far they're willing to take it. This is another movie I love because I am seriously eager to see how it ends. The ending did not disappoint and it's quite unexpected.Even better is how Keaton comes off as so realistic in this. Apart from having great gags and slapstick, I really do associate with this character a lot! I guess it might only be because I'm nearing my twenty-seventh birthday and have yet to find a wife myself! Thankfully, I'm not in this scenario myself! It takes awhile for the really good parts to happen, but they're so amazing you're not going to care! Don't get me wrong, there are many great scenes before, especially another zany car chase.Whenever I hear the name "Keaton" in terms of actors, I always think of Michael Keaton. It's sad that his career ended with sound movies. I think there's a heard sound effect in this movie with one of the guns fired. Perfect ****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>IT HAS BEEN reported that Buster Keaton was less than happy that the rights to this play had been bought and ticked for delivery as a future project for his company. The reason given that by 1925 this was old. Keaton thought it to have been a real "turkey", even when it was new.WELL IT TURNED out much, much better than anyone could have imagined while in Keaton's charge. His instincts and skills for what to do with it transformed it into a really great representative piece of work by "the Great Stone Face" and one that is often chosen as representative of his over all output; even though he never dons overalls during its running time.AND WHILE WE are on the subject of length, it fits into a category which would later be dubbed "Streamliner: by the competitor Hal Roach Studios. That is, its running time around an hour (in this case 56 minutes); which allows it to be comfortably featured as a part of a Double Feature. (the vest thing since sliced bread in its day) THE STORY HAS been told that Buster &amp; company weren't quite sure how to wrap things up; until a preview audience gave them a clue. They seemed to expect more from the paper-mache boulders; so the scenes featuring the veritable avalanche of giant rocks was amplified.THE GAG WORKED even better that expected and probably even changed Mr. Keaton's attitude about the play which became a most successful cog in his output. (It was remade as a 3 STOOGES' short featuring Shemp Howard as the luckless would be Groom)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blissful delirium</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The genius on show in this film is like watching farce and slapstick executed by a Mozart of comedy. It is so comically hyperventilating that you go beyond mere laughs into a realm of blissful delirium as absurdity is piled upon sublime absurdity, until solid reality simply gives up and collapses into a dancing avalanche of drollery. Buster Keaton shakes us on a Richter scale of laughter, leaving our world delightfully re-arranged into the dizzying dream of somewhere better - a place we can be completely carried away, like the sort of wild party where true love is always waiting, so long as you are ready to abandon all reason and make a complete fool of yourself. Such is the magical and hilarious trajectory of our bouncing hero through a world of epic obstacles, each of which he circumvents by executing miracles with the grace of a sad-faced clown. Here is a circus of the human soul, where grace transforms our doltish misadventures into soaring flights of fancy that must surely make even the angels smile at such happy accidents! They welcome the jeu d'esprit that can rise above disaster, vaulting over it with the soaring energy of LIFE, the pure and utterly undismayed force that encourages us to pick ourselves up and carry on. In many ways the spectacle of Keaton prevailing against absurdly proliferating setbacks represents the only authentic survival of the increasingly battered American Dream. Buster just never gives up - bad luck will give in before he stops trying! He's the little man apotheosized by a ridiculous and powerful idealism. He's the enemy of bitterness and cynicism. With his manifold rolling rocks he escapes like some kind of crazy incarnation of Hope. He bowls us over like the boundless love of a soppy dog. He shakes us out of our stuffy places for long, erratic runs through the heart-warming sunshine that stretches unbroken from that day to this, and for as long as such brilliance can lighten our lives.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was a real joy to watch this at the local Cinematheque with lots of people laughing and enjoying this classic comedy. It is a premise that has been repeated many times since. Buster Keaton is Jimmie Shannon. A prologue was included in the showing. This prologue was shot with color tinting, but did not screen with most theatrical releases here in the states. In it Jimmie's longtime courting of Mary (Dwyer) is consistently met with cold feet and her dog coming between them. In the main film Jimmie and his buddy Billy (Barnes) are having difficulty keeping their financial firm in the black. An attorney (Snitz Edwards) must track down Jimmie to read his grandfather's will. Jimmie will receive an inheritance of 7 million dollars, IF he is married before 7 p.m. on his 27th birthday! Oh, look at that, today is his 27th birthday. He blunders through proposing to Mary and so Billy and the attorney tag along to the nearby country club to find a bride. They count 7 women lounging in the club, hence the Seven Chances. However, before it is all over Jimmie will have a large church full of women, including women spilling out all over the street outside, chasing him when they find out he will be a millionaire. There is a long, complex chase scene with lots of great visual gags and Keaton hurling himself from one attempt at escape to another. It's a riot. Will he make the deadline? Does he have the stamina? I am growing to really love Buster Keaton's craft as a comedian.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Build-Up and the Payoff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SEVEN CHANCES (1925) is a Buster Keaton vehicle, wherein a young man receives an inheritance from his grandfather ? with the condition that he marry on his 27th birthday. His quest to find a wife in time to make the deadline is the driving force behind this comedy. Directed by Buster Keaton.This film takes some time to really develop its comic potential to the full. At first it proceeds rather slowly, but then the laughs slowly start to build up?and the payoff in the final act is spectacular. The various rejections he encounters in his quest for a wife are quite amusing. Unfortunately, some of the comedy relies on stereotype-driven blackface humor, which was considered funny at the time but is cringe- inducing now. In the last act, Keaton again shows his mastery of outrageous sight gags and athleticism, all done in his trademark deadpan persona. An ad in the paper brings many prospective brides to a church, and then the pastor convinces them that it was a prank, resulting in one of the most hilariously inventive chase sequences ever, treating us viewers to a raging torrent of hysterical sight gags and daring athleticism by Keaton. You'll have to see it to believe it. And the ending is just what you wished for, all done in a nice compact 56 minute runtime. SCORE: 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always heard Buster Keaton was a genius. He may be but in my Silent movie revival I have not really enjoyed any of his movies before this one.So honestly I was not so exited when I saw it was a Buster Keaton movie I was going to see. But my doubt was proved very wrong.I was laughing through most of the movie and especially the last half part was amazing. It was not like they reused the comical situations. All the time new and wonderful things happened, and it was not really hard to see this movie have inspired a lot of other movies over time.If you love a great comedy you definitely need to see this movie. By far the best Buster Keaton movie I have seen. I would also place it in my top 3 with Silent movie comedies. Even fun for people not used to Silent movies.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Our Hospitality was good comedy fun, The General was a great comedy adventure, and Sherlock Junior is a superb silent comedy film, and this was the fourth Buster Keaton I would see featured in the 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die book. The film opens with young James 'Jimmie' Shannon (Keaton, also directing) trying for all the seasons of a year to tell Mary Jones (Ruth Dwyer) that he loves her, but he keeps failing miserably. He and his partner Billy Meekin (T. Roy Barnes) know that their company is due to face bankruptcy unless they can get a big wad of cash, and then in comes Jimmie's Attorney/Lawyer (Snitz Edwards) telling him that he is to inherit a seven million dollar fortune from his grandfather. But there is a catch, he has to marry before seven o'clock on the day of his twenty-seventh birthday, which happens to be today, and Jimmie can only think of one girl to ask and may agree to it. So he goes to see Mary, and she does agree initially, until he blows it by saying that he needs to marry "some girl", and she goes off in a huff and now refusing. So Jimmie's Lawyer and Billy are determined to help him find a wife quickly before time runs out and he loses the chance to inherit the money. They try very quickly and Jimmie recognises seven women in the country club to try asking, so he gets his seven chances (as the title implies), three of the women laugh, one looks at the wrong man to marry, and the other three are just rude. While Mary is considering changing her mind, and Jimmie is asking almost every girls he happens to pass, including a foreign girl, a manikin head, a black woman and many more, the Lawyer and Billy have placed an advert in the paper in the help of attracting interested women. The only problem is, there are hundreds of women dressed in white dresses that turn up at the church where the ceremony is meant to take place, and Jimmie is forced to run for it seeing all the potential suitors. The hundreds of brides chase Jimmie all over the place, including through building sites, on a train line and finally down a hill that starts a rock slide, one of the films most iconic scenes. Eventually Jimmie returns home to find the The Clergyman (Erwin Connelly) ready to marry him to someone, and Mary does turn up ready for it, and after a near miss failure, they are married, the fortune is safe, and Jimmie kisses everyone else, including the dog, before the bride. Also starring Frances 'Frankie' Raymond as Mrs. Jones and Jean Arthur as receptionist at country club. Filled with some of the funniest comedy moments, I completely agree with it featuring in the must see book, and the critics only give it three stars, so it is a slightly underrated silent masterpiece from the great Keaton that should be cherished. Buster Keaton was number 21 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good fun, some great laughs and a touching dash of romance on top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seven Chances is a lovely reminder of just how larger than life the silent film era's productions could be, and while this particular example of star Buster Keaton is not without it's limitations as direct from the technology at the time, the film still holds up well eighty years on. As a comedy, it is slapstick in nature, and more funny than not, delivering many great visual gags as well as a few instances of wit either derived from the sporadic text, or from Keaton's actions himself. Furthermore, the romantic subplot which plays a large role in the overall arc of the feature is just as effective, if not more-so working to give the film a timeless appeal through it's heart-felt but not overly serious explorations of love. First and foremost however, Seven Chances is simple, light-hearted comedic fun meant to distract and entertain, and that's exactly what it does for the most part. To be sure, the pace can get a little too erratic for its own good at times, and often the wackiness of this generation of cinema can be a little hard to adjust to, but if you can overlook these minor bumps then there is indeed much fun to be had from sitting back and enjoying something a little different from modern cinema.The story which keeps things relatively simple in a neat premise is one that serves the nature of the film well enough to deliver both the subtle romance and the overt slapstick. Keaton here plays 'Jimmie', a stock broker in legal trouble with his partner, who on his birthday learns that he has inherited money from a dead relative, which in turn would solve all his problems. The catch however is that Jimmie has to be married by 7PM that day, or else the fortune would not be passed over to him. What follows on from this rather ridiculous exposition is a fast-paced and well constructed tale that is just as ridiculous, if not even more. It's a staple of the time in that comedy was comedy, and drama was drama, and while there is still plenty of grounding rules present in The Seven Chances, it's one of those films that doesn't feel realistic, but draws much of its laughs from this very feature. Characters are flat and largely uninteresting as people, but as placeholders for ideas of both themes of romance and comedy, they work very well and fulfil their roles as intended.As was the case with many films of the time, the silent film was one that relied heavily on its visuals to do the storytelling, the action and everything in between. Seven Chances is no exception here, as, with very little in the way of text to support the plot, much is put on Keaton and crew's shoulders to deliver the punches when required. As a pure visual treat, the film is vintage ice cream. Presented in unassuming sepia, and with action usually much too fast than reality would warrant, the film posses a distinct charm which, in combination with its superb direction is always entertaining to watch. The action, which takes place upon many different sets and locations, is frantic and manic, showcasing choreography that thrills even more than modern blockbuster epics do nowadays.To be fair, all the running around (particularly the final fifteen minute chase) can be a bit of a mixed bag, delivering some great excitement, but also some other much more unsuccessful scenes which are more superfluous than necessary. With the help of Keaton though, much of these moments remain a joy to watch regardless of how long they seem to drag on for, and for the sheer spectacle of the thing, which when taking into account the fact that Keaton did all his own stunts, and coming from a time when CGI was science-fiction, is pure cinematic magic. Buster himself is top-notch throughout, filling the lead role as performer and director superbly, bringing with him his unique charm, charisma and stage presence that helps meld the whole production together into an ambitious, but simple-on-page piece of entertainment; good fun, some great laughs and a touching dash of romance on top.For more of my reviews, please visit here: http://www.invocus.net</fullReview>

The most hair-raising is the famous rockslide hill chase, which I read came about somewhat by accident; during a preview screening, the tumbling rocks got the biggest laughs, so Keaton re-shot the scene with lots of paper-maiche boulders. I also thought the love story was quite effective, and there were a couple of moments where I wished I could hear his voice saying those lines. ("Who bats next?")DOUG: As we take in our third consecutive Buster Keaton film, I'm starting to wonder if we didn't overload on Keaton and leave Chaplin by the wayside. Regardless, I did enjoy this installment, though not as much as Navigator or Sherlock Jr. This one starts off slow, picking up steam in the third act as Buster is pursued by hundreds of potential brides hoping to collect on his inheritance. How many single women can this town possibly have?! Of course it's a comedy, so it works. The best stuff is in the rock slide; caught between a barrage of oncoming rocks above and a swarm of oncoming brides below, Buster turns into the rockslide, apparently deciding that it's safer that way. Keaton's deadpan face comes in handy as he goes searching for a bride. To me, he seemed to be thinking "this is ridiculous. I'm making a fool of myself. All that money isn't worth this." He gets off what could be called a memorable quote in these scenes, as he turns to his guys and asks, "Who bats next?" Last film: The Navigator (1924). Next film: Strike (1925).The Movie Odyssey is an exhaustive, chronological project where we watch as many milestone films as possible, starting with D.W. Griffith's Intolerance in 1916 and working our way through, year by year, one film at a time. We also write a short review for each film before we watch the next, never reading the other's review before we finish our own. In this project, we hope to gain a deeper understanding of the time period, the films of the era, and each film in context, while at the same time just watching a lot of great movies, most of which we never would have watched otherwise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming silent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a charming comedy directed by and starring Buster Keaton. T. Roy Barnes, Snitz Edwards, and Ruth Dwyer have starring roles as well, but Buster is the main attraction.Buster and his partner are brokers who have been duped into a scheme and need money fast. It doesn't matter. Suddenly a lawyer turns up and says Buster will inherit $7,000,000 if he's married by 7:00 PM that day. Fortunately, he's in love, but there's many a slip twixt cup and lip as my grandmother used to say, and we have about an hour and a half of pratfalls, slapstick, and tricks before Buster finally gets the dough. And the girl. And the dog.It's a 1925 movie, so some of the bits are racist, and in one scene he rejects a woman because she's Jewish. The movie is a product of its time, which is a dual-edged sword, I'm sorry to say.The opening scene was shot in Technicolor, and that version is available on Netflix streaming. I understand Jean Arthur, one of my favorite actresses, is the telephone operator, but I did not recognize her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A silent comedy that gets better as it ages!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the silent comedies, this is easily my favourite. Move over, Charlie Chaplin fans, and acknowledge that Buster Keaton is the real master of physical comedy! The finale, where Buster is running down a mountain side as he's being bombarded by big boulders from a rock slide, is jaw-dropping hilarious. A must-see. P.S. Avoid the 1999 remake. An insult to the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gets better with repeated viewings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even into his old age, Buster Keaton was not fond of Seven Chances (1925). His producer Joe Schneck forced the material on him; it was based off of a flop stage farce, and the farce genre was one Keaton disliked immensely.It is true that this is not the best of Keaton's work. And the unfortunate addition of a blackface character and a few instances of non-PC humor can make it an uncomfortable experience for a modern audience.However, this film has grown on me over time. The story slow builds, becoming funnier and funnier until we get to that explosive climax where Buster is chased down by hundreds of murderous brides and then nature itself in the form of a rock avalanche.It's not the ideal or most timeless of Keaton's films, but it has more merit than its creator ever realized.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This must rank as one of Keaton's best. Can you think of any other comic who created such a great legacy in such a short period of time? I mean, consecutive hits like OUR HOSPITALITY, SHERLOCK JR., THE NAVIGATOR, SEVEN CHANCES, THE GENERAL, STEAMBOAT BILL JR., THE CAMERAMAN, not to mention all those great short films. Keaton did in about eight years what it took Chaplin to do in fifty. Chaplin revolutionized comedy when he worked at Essanay and Mutual, but then became stagnated in his old ways. While he was doing unfunny 2-reelers during the early 20s, Keaton was quickly becoming the big name in screen comedy. Lloyd enjoyed a similar success, if based more on entertainment value than artistic value. W.C. Fields was the last big comic to have control over his films, ending in 1940. It wasn't until 1960 that Jerry Lewis became the first comic auteur since the silent days, paving the way for Woody Allen and Mel Brooks today. But Keaton remains perhaps the master auteur of the genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sorry, but this doesn't work</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You can see why MGM ruined Buster Keaton. In "Seven Chances," they stick him in a Broadway romantic comedy, for which he's totally unsuited. He even is well dressed, with slicked-up hair. The last third is a familiar chase sequence, totally out of character with the rest of the movie and below Keaton's standards.However, what's worth seeing is one of two shorts tacked on the end of the DVD, "Neighbors." A character-based comedy (Buster's in love with the girl across the city fence; their parents try to keep them apart), it's sidesplitting and brilliant. Note: There are racial gags, some at white people's expense, others (sadly) at black's expense. At least Keaton used blacks in "Neighbors," not the whites in blackface in "Seven Chances."The DVD is worth renting just for "Neighbors." Good music score, too.</fullReview>
