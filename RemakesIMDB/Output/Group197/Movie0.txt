		<fullReview>I tried to watch this film once before and made it up to the second rape scene before leaving the room, believing I was seriously about to throw up. I finally forced myself to watch it all the way through recently, and I'm glad I did. Jennifer Hill is a young, hip, free-spirited woman of the 70s, who leaves her home in New York City for a long vacation in Connecticut, where she plans to write her first novel. Jennifer soon attracts the attention of four lowlife scumbags as she sunbathes in her bikini. The semi-evolved thugs kidnap Jennifer, drag her into the woods, rape her, beat her, sodomize her, beat her some more, follow her home, rape her again, kick her when she's down, make fun of her manuscript, rip it to shreds, rape her with a bottle, beat her up one last time and leave her, bleeding and unconscious on the floor of her vacation home. Damn. They send the retarded Matthew back into the house with a knife and instructions to kill her, but Matthew can't bring himself to do it. He tells the guys that he has killed her, and they stupidly believe him and leave. But Jennifer is alive, and as she heals from her hideous wounds and recovers her strength, she plots revenge against her rapists. Roger Ebert called this the worst film ever made and feminists damned it to hell for all eternity, but you know what? I'm a woman and I liked it. Jennifer is no weak, whimpering, helpless little victim. She tries her best to fight back. When threats and violence fail to work in her favor, she uses the only other weapon she has: sex. The men are all stereotypical slobs, disgusting pigs who are clearly already emasculated and use Jennifer as an outlet for their frustration and rage. The rapes have nothing to do with sex and are portrayed most realistically - they are ugly, brutal, violent, nasty and completely devoid of eroticism. The sodomy scene was the one scene that horrified me the most, as Jennifer emits the most bloodcurdling scream of pain ever heard. It is very difficult not to flinch from that sound. Jennifer's revenge is every bit as bloody and painful, and nowhere is it more sadistic than in the infamous "bloodbath" scene. These guys all get what's coming to them, and Jennifer makes sure that the punishment fits the crime, turning the men into the helpless, pleading victims and feeding their own sadism right back to them.Okay, so not all of the plot points make sense, and not everyone is going to agree with Jennifer's decision to kill the men, but it's still a powerful film. It's told primarily from Jennifer's point of view but it never takes sides. It simply tells the story and lets you decide - is Jennifer an insane psycho-killer who ought to go to jail for her crimes, or is she an angel of vengeance delivering poetic justice?Scaredy cats like me might prefer to watch this film with the audio commentary by Joe Bob Briggs turned on. Joe Bob provides a lot of interesting information about the making of this film, and also supplies some much needed comic relief throughout.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (1978) is one of the most notorious pictures ever released during the seventies. Along with LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and Thriller: A cruel picture, it's one of the greatest revenge flicks of that era. A feminist writer goes out to the country so she could have some peace and quiet whilst working on her first novel. Instead she runs into a group of male locals who decide to have some fun with her. Unlike many other movies of this ilk, I.S.O.Y.G. is not like other"exploitation films". There is nothing sexual or provocative in this picture. The director wanted to show what it's like to be raped and the after effects of such a traumatizing event. He went through great lengths in research and from his own personnel experience. I found it to be a very different film than all of the others that deal with the same subject matter. The film-making (for a first time director) was very well done and for the most part the acting was up to par. I am proud to admit that I have this film as part of my collection. Don't believe the hype. This is a good movie. Highly recommended.P.S. The subject matter is real graphic, but rape is not enjoyable. The director did an excellent job of portraying the true horror of it instead of hollywoodizing this dirty, degrading act.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the piece of trash that it's reputation suggests it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit on Your Grave is a film that will never be accepted as a serious piece of film-making. This is thanks in part to the gratuitous rape and murder scenes, which don't exactly hold back the shocks; and it's also due to the time in which it was made. These days, as proved by the likes of 'Irreversible', films tackling rape in a shocking and disgusting way are more readily accepted, and even gain a strong reaction from many critics. This film was unfortunately (albeit for good reason) caught up in the 'video nasty debate' in the early eighties, and as such it's reputation has been diminished to such an extent that the likes of Roger Ebert have labelled it 'the worst film ever made' (even though The Blair Witch Project is the worst film ever made) and it's reaction in general tends to be of the bad variety. For some reason, we have found ourselves in a world where it's more than acceptable to give praise to 'A class' rape themed dramas such as Irreversible, but woe betide thee who labels this as a good film. Well, woe betides me then.For a 'video nasty', I Spit on Your Grave has surprisingly good production values. While the acting often lets it down, the cinematography and even the script are more than decent and this helps the film in it's bid to get the praise it deserves. The story, which follows a New York writer who moves to a backwater part of the USA to work on her new novel, shortly before being horribly raped and beaten, is just a plot device for the more important elements of the plot. The main theme on display seems to be a comment on the male sexual ego and the way that women can have power over them. The film plays out like a revenge thriller, with the protagonist getting her own back on the men who raped her. This disrupts the main argument against this film; namely, that it's misogynistic, as much of the violence in the movie is actually directed against men. Of course, the rape scenes are the main crux of the film; but most of the gore comes later. Don't get me wrong, this is hardly an uplifting feminist drama; but it's not the worst film ever made either. Content caution though; it gets a bit extreme. A certain scene in a bathroom takes the prize for being one of the sickest sequences ever to grace the silver screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A pearl in this maligned genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a straightforward rape/revenge drama with the tone of a documentary.The coverage is plain, there is no music, there are no "stars", there are no concessions to a mainstream audience.The exploitation film audience may be served, although the rape sequences are neither dynamic nor stylish.Camille Keaton (Buster's granddaughter), a writer, drives to the country to stay at her house on the river. Local losers stalk her and rape her and rape her again.The rest of the film details the victim's bloody revenge.Labeled rubbish by the ignorant, this is very restrained exploitation that is often perversely effective and confronting.The rape sequences are nasty and ugly, not enhanced by camera moves, rich sound effects or lurid angles.On the other hand, the revenge sequences are more cinematically manipulative and poorly executed.An intriguing document of merit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Widely misunderstood.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all the films that were implicated in the absurd and sickening tabloid-fueled "video nasties" witch-hunt in the UK, some were demonised more than others. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE joins a select few as being one of THE films cited for causing the most problems at the time. Certainly, the title and advertising campaign (in classic exploitation fashion) was garish and contentious, but unlike some other films that suffered the same fate (such as SS EXPERIMENT CAMP), Zarchi's film is extremely powerful and disturbing... not to mention widely misinterpreted.I've read a large number of reviews of this film. A worryingly high percentage of them accuse this movie of somehow advocating rape, and being sexist and demeaning. That is the last thought that crosses my mind whilst watching this. The whole "rape/revenge" genre is one that is fraught with moral contradictions. In essence, films of this type ARE exploiting the subject of rape (and sadly, often presenting it in a sexually ambiguous way) but does this mean that they are not able to condemn the subject matter, or offer a powerful criticism of the behaviour of many men towards women? The same school of argument is used against critical film-making like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST- can a film truly condemn what it exploits? I believe so, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a triumphant example of this, putting forward more powerful a message about violence of rape and the attitudes of some men towards it than any other movie I care to mention. However, it goes even deeper than this in this particular case. Zarchi doesn't praise the rapists- nor does he condemn them. Similarly he offers no moral judgment on the revenge that is carried out by the female protagonist. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE offers a truly subjective message in that it presents gritty reality and leaves the viewer to make up their mind on the matter.Much is made of the fact that the rape scenes last for around forty minutes. It seems that a lot of critics think that by proxy, long scenes of violence equal pure exploitation. In this case, this is far from the truth. The scenes are horrific, grueling and ugly. There is no kind of glorification of rape here. The scenes are shot practically real-time which brings home the gritty and sickening nature of what is being displayed. Furthermore, a lot of the scenes are shot from the victim's perspective. The revolting sight of sweating, grunting men is absolutely anti-sexual and anti-erotic, which is of course EXACTLY what it should be in this context! Rape has little to do with sex, and a great deal more to do with violence and power. This is expressed superbly in the sequences in this film. Sanitising the scenes that are supposedly "exploitative" would trivialise the very serious issues at hand. The men presented in I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE are nothing to emulate. Nothing is even said about the backgrounds of their characters- they are totally faceless within the context of the film (other than one long shot later on which shows one of the men with his family- merely proving him to be a liar and cheat as well as a rapist). The point here is that they don't even NEED character building- they represent the threat and actuality of sexual violence that women face every day. The final and most telling twist is that these men are then so gullible and arrogant that they could be seduced and murdered by the person they had attacked. If Ebert and all his sniveling comrades are really right about this film "promoting sexual violence", they must see something appealing in the behaviour of these men.Despite what you might read elsewhere, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a tightly constructed and well crafted piece of film-making containing some powerfully symbolic imagery. Scenes such as Keaton sitting broken and alone in her house after her attacks or her swimming costume limply floating in the river are extremely effective. There is also practically no music in the entire film. The viewer can almost feel the sense of isolation at every stage of the story- initially it is liberating but it quickly becomes frightening as events unfold. The simple cinematography reflects the isolated feel of the locations that frame this film. Many horror films can be fairly accused of being misogynistic. I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE takes these concepts of misogyny and totally turns them around. This film is EMPOWERING, and whilst it does have the cynical production of an exploitation feature, Zarchi took this and created a powerful, bitter and dynamic story with many issues being explored therein. It's great. Check it out if you haven't already, and if you've watched it before with the wrong approach to it, I demand you have another look. This is one of the pinnacles of the genre but sadly it is (in)famous for all the wrong reasons.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The horror of rape is graphically depicted.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not a fun film. This is not an easy film to watch. But this is certainly not a film without merit. The first half of this film takes the audience through a terrible descent into a hell most of us can only imagine. The horror of rape. And this film treats this subject with a frightening realism. No fancy lighting. No mood music hanging in the background. Simply, the horror of rape. The horror of having one's life violated in the most unspeakably vile manner imaginable. That is the purpose of this film. This film does not want to entertain. It wants to repulse. And it succeeds! This film is as sickening as the rape it depicts. Why make a film like this? One might jump to the conclusion that the film was aimed at the prurient interests of perverts who enjoy viewing the degradation and violation of women. But that is an unfair conclusion. This is a film with a purpose. A message. And this film seems to be carefully designed to send that message loud and clear to every viewer: RAPE IS A TRULY HORRIBLE CRIME! Horrible beyond what most of us could ever imagine.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Spit On Your Grave has the worst title in history next to Attack of the Clones! This is not the campy, horror, gore fest you expect, it's an angrier, nastier take on deliverance.A you writer goes to a secluded cabin for the summer to write her first novel.Three local twenty-something's and the town idiot snatch her in the woods, take turns rapping and tormenting her, and in an obviously moronic move, put the dumb guy in charge of killing her. Well, he just can't do it and when she recovers she gets even.What's working here is that there's a true emotional bond between the character and the audience. She's harassed a bit at first, then when a couple of the guys try for her attention and she turns her back they decided she's a tease and just needs to be getting some to come around. One by one they take her, let her go, then surround her again. The rapes are brutal, but honest, clumsy, messy, bloody affairs, her situation is tragic and hopeless and her revenge more than justified.She has a gun, she could waste her time and ours being Chuck Bronson and just shooting them, but instead she plays them. She draws them back, seduces them, then Hangs, Castrates, Axes and out-board motor's them. The tag line says there's five men, they can't count, there's only four.There's a genuine film under all the gore and fact that our protagonist spends nearly 80% of the film completely naked. However her emotions are as exposed as her body, her transformation from normality, to victim, through recovery and finally as executioner.</fullReview>

Three rednecks and a delivery boy (a retarded) rape her and humiliate her in very horrible ways (about 40 minutes of . Then, she takes revenge in unexpected ways too. The atmosphere, the silence, and the loneliness of the character and the absolutely explicit scenes of the rape, and a great amount of blood are the elements for creating the tension and the sensation of anguish that makes this movie special.

		<fullReview>I first got wind of this film when I was about 16 years old and I bought a book about horror films. It told you about what they considered were some of the best films out there, some of the sickest and some of the worst. I Spit..... made the list of one of the sickest and one of the worst. But this film was nowhere to be found in suburban Ontario. As it was in most places, it was banned. It's funny, Last House On The Left was still available in London Ontario at the neighbourhood Blockbuster and I Spit.... was banned. To me, Last House is a much more disturbing film but it was still there. It doesn't make any sense. But that's how things are these days. So it has taken me almost twelve years to track this film down but I did. I had to order it off of the Internet, but I finally found some guy in Northern California that would sell it to me for almost $30.00 Canadian. Quite a hefty price for a film like this one, but when curiosity gets the best of you, nothing can stop the wheels of determination from running their course.So, was all the fuss warranted? I don't think so. Not only is this film really not all that sleazy, it really isn't much of a horror film and it is not as horrific as people will have you believe. Where all the controversy comes from is that the woman gets raped six ways till Sunday in the film by some local idiots, one of them who happens to be somewhat retarded. So people get up in arms about it and say how bad it is and how determental towards woman's rights and the woman's movement and so on. When really what should have happened is, if people really wanted this film to be ostracized from the annals of film history, they should have just left it alone. I can guarantee you that if there wasn't such a push to ban this film, then no one would really give a damn about it. After all, it really is a poorly made film. In all seriousness, anyone with a video camera could have made this. It's really just soft core porn and then it transgresses into a sloppy revenge piece. There is no suspense, no drama, no shocks. What we have here is a woman that gets raped for a half an hour and then recovers enough so that she can extract revenge on her rapists. There is one scene that everyone talks about as being hard to stomach and that is the castration scene. But there is nothing to it. Just like there is nothing to any of the other killings. You don't see anything, all you get is a prosaic take on what is happening to the rapists. By the time this happens in the film, you are at least cogitating her revenge for her. You are thinking of all the things that she could do to the perverts and then she actually does some of them but you get no satisfaction in the action. You have to think and imagine what is happening. Now I can enjoy a film like Blair Witch and Texas Chainsaw Massacre and even Halloween where you have to use your imagination to some extent. But those films were at least scary, this one isn't.I Spit On Your Grave is an over-hyped film given it's reputation by stuffy, repressed, squalid people that are just looking for a reason to hate something like this. I don't think this film is good but that does not mean that I think it should be banned. People should be able to make up their own minds and decide whether or not they want to watch it. After all, it is only a movie. Deal with it.6 out of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In summertime, the aspirant New Yorker writer Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) rents a lakeside cottage in the woods of the peaceful Park Hell Lane, Connecticut, to write her first novel during the vacation. A couple of days later, she is successively and brutally gang raped by three local bigoted rednecks and one retarded delivery boy from the supermarket. The humiliated and abused Jennifer does not report the sexual assault to the police and a couple of weeks later, she is physically recovered and has just plotted revenge against the rapists."Day of the Woman" is extremely realistic and violent; therefore the simple and scary story is absolutely credible. The unknown Camille Keaton has an amazing performance, especially in the impressive long sequence when she is repeatedly beaten and raped. However, this gore movie is only recommended for very specific audiences and prohibited to sensitive persons due to the savagery of most of the scenes. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "A Vingança de Jennifer" ("The Revenge of Jennifer")</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the most controversial and notorious exploitation films ever made and it's certainly not hard to see why either!Vacationing woman is savagely raped by four country boys and left for dead. Unfortunately for them, she isn't dead and she's not happy! While uncut versions of this film may make it seem like some sort of snuff film, Day of the Woman a.k.a. I Spit on Your Grave is much better than mere trash. Meir Zarchi gives us a shocking, violent, yet captivating tale of human evil and just revenge. Even in the face of its nastiest scenes, Zarchi gives this film splendid yet simple direction. He wonderfully exposes the lush, raw setting of the woodsy filming locations, adding all the more to the realistic feel of the film. Zarchi also chooses to add no music to the film, only natural sound.Camille Keaton is a silent force as the rape victim. She is beautiful and does a terrific turn in character. Eron Tabor is excellent as the leader of the dead-beat gang. Tabor has got to be one of the sleaziest villains anywhere. Richard Pace is great in his performance as a retarded young man. Gunter Kleemann is also memorable as another assailant.Day of the Woman is a film only for the exploitation fans. It's stark power is disturbing in a way few films (even of this extreme genre) ever are! Not for the faint.*** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ultimate rape and revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>*SPOILER ALERT* *SPOILER ALERT* "I Spit on your Grave" is the greatest rape and revenge flick ever made. It is brutal, powerful, sleazy and exploitative. It is also quite effective and will probably leave scars on you. Obviously, it's a must see.A female writer goes out into the woods to get some work done. Four locals start checking her out and decide they want more. Now, at this point you are expecting a rape scene. You know its coming. So the locals take her in the grass and have their way with her. It's not a very graphic rape. I was expecting to be shocked but I wasn't. It was at this point that the movie really began. As the writer walks away, she is pounced on and raped a second time. This scene was brutal. There is no music or editing done on the rape scene. It is shot as if you are really there watching it happen. She is pinned down on a rock and screams for her life. Does the movie want you to enjoy what you're seeing or would it rather have you be disgusted at the sexual violence? I don't know. I would imagine it wants it both ways. Horror fans will probably love the thrill of being shocked while others will be repulsed.What really takes "I Spit on your Grave" over the top is the next rape scene. Yes, she's raped a third time. She crawls back to her house and is violated again. Now we know that these men are cretins and deserve everything they've got coming to them. The rest of the movie has the writer dishing out bloody death to the lecherous men. She knows the power her body has over them and decides to use it so that she can spit on their graves.I found this movie to be a brutal gut punch. The rape scenes were tough to watch. "I Spit on your Grave" is not just some cheap horror flick. It is undeniably shocking and well made. For horror fans looking for something to really hurt them, "I Spit on your Grave" will do it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An extreme exploitation flick that works out surprising well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lets just forget the title "Day of the Woman", the alternate title for which this movie is much better known for; "I Spit on Your Grave" is a far better one and part of the reason why this has become a sort of a cult-classic over the years. It's a pretty repulsive and extreme movie in which a young woman gets gang-raped. The second part of the movie focuses on the woman, taking revenge on her rapists, Charlie Bronson style, that on its own right is also pretty extreme as well.This movie features the longest rape scene out of movie history? I don't know but the entire first halve of the movie is basically about the woman getting raped by 4 different guys, multiple times, in various violent ways. It just never stops and just when you think its over it starts all over again for her. That is what mostly makes the rape within this movie shocking and disturbing. It's something pretty extreme for a movie to feature, even for an '70's exploitation flick.Also the way the woman takes revenge upon her rapists is pretty extreme and mostly original as well. The movie its story basically features too extremes; rape and killing. It's combination might not be unique but the way it is being handled within this movie is. On top of it all, it works out well within the movie, much to my own surprise. I mean, the main story for this movie sounds pretty ludicrous but because of the two extremes within the movie, the movie balances out well. I especially liked the way the second halve of the movie worked out, in which the woman starts her revenge. I can't of course with a straight face claim that this is a brilliant movie or anything like that, it's far too amateur like made for that but it basically is great as an '70's exploitation flick, that is worthy of its cult status.For yes, it's an obvious very cheap made movie, with poor production values. The sound sounds pretty messed up at times and the acting is just plain poor for 80% of the time. Especially Camille Keaton is no great natural acting talent and is the reason why she isn't active in the business anymore and has never broken through. She was married to the movie its director/writer/producer/editor Meir Zarchi at the time, which probably was the only reason why she got cast in the movie. Appearantly she also is the grand-niece of the brilliant Buster Keaton and I must say that she looks a bit like him.A great movie for what it is.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A terrible film on many levels *SPOILERS*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit On Your Grave was one of those movies in the ilk of 'Cannibal Holocaust' and 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre' which was banned in the UK by the BBFC for many years. Like these films, it has now received a commercial release, albeit after several cuts were made to cut down on the extreme violence portrayed within. And if this is what the film was like after cuts, I shudder to think what it was like before.The film is about a female writer who decides to take a trip to the countryside to get away from bustling New York and work peacefully on her new novel. This is shattered however, when a bunch of local hicks ritually abuse and rape her. Instead of calling the police, she decides to take matters into her own hands, and uses her body to lure the men to their deaths.Whilst this may seem like a fair enough plot for a film, the director did not get his priorities straight. The rape scene in this (the cut version) was over 30 minutes long and still featured the repeated beating and abuse of the writer. Whilst he may have wanted to establish how shocking the attack was, it did not have to been drawn out for nearly half of the film. Because of this, several other key elements are lost.None of the characters have any depth to them, as all the men are just random Hicksville inhabitants who have as much depth as a petri dish and as much intelligence as a sponge. The one exception to this however, is Jonny, the ringleader of the rapists. With Jonny we find out more about him and his family, as he is quickly established as an evil peice of work. He shows no remorse for the rape, he feels that she was asking for it by 'flaunting' her body in a bikini.And thus we move onto the murders. It seems the director wanted to see Camille Keaton naked for as much of the film as possible as even after the rape she uses her body to murder the rapists. Jonny, the ringleader recieves the goriest, most horrible death when his penis is sliced off with a knife while he is in a bath. This was by far the high point of the film, as it shows him getting his just desserts. The other deaths merely pale in comparison, especially the last two which seem like throwaways because the director was running out of time. Also because of this the film ends abruptly with no real feeling of closure. It would have been nice to see the results of what happened after the deaths.The film was long and drawn out at times since there was no music apart from within the film (Church organ, generic hick #324 playing harmonica). This makes scenes with such boring things as walking along a railway track REALLY boring as there was nothing to see other than Camille slowly walk closer to the camera. You never realise quite how much music adds to the mood of a movie until you actually view a film with a distinct lack of it.The acting for the most part was mediocre at best, but usually dredged down arounf the terrible level. As mentioned earlier, the rapists, with the exception of Jonny were generic hicks and as such anyone could have played the role, acting experience or not. The standout performance by far was Camille Keaton who portayed greatly the role of an abused woman with inner anguish to release. As previously stated however, we get no real information as to what she does after the murders.The film focuses far too much on the lead actress' body throughout the movie and not enough on establishing characters/proper conclusion. This film is not really suitable for anyone to watch in my opinion, as the rape scene is simply too long by far and makes the whole film worthless. Best to avoid. 2/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A calm, rational writer from the city comes to a little summer spot in a rural setting off the beaten path to relax and write her novel. What Jennifer(Camille Keaton, in a powerful performance that is both daring and courageous;few would be able to submit to such a difficult role)doesn't suspect is that a gas station owner she meets on her way to the summer place plans, along with two other country bumpkin pals, to provide their simple-minded, impressionable grocery biker, Matthew(Richard Pace)a good time at her expense. Over the course of 40 minutes, Jennifer will be subjected to the most vile cruelties man can dish out on a rape victim. She is so brutally victimized, Jennifer has become almost a hollow shell who can only find her way back to humanity and feeling by exacting revenge to each member who tormented her sexually and physically.A full blooded rape/revenge film if there ever was one, this film asks a lot from any discernible viewer and will repulse most because it depicts man at his most audacious, purely evil level. The main three culprits who hold her down, gang raping her do so with glee not even thinking about what the victim is going through. It can make for a numbing experience that will push many to the brink of turning it off. It depicts her rape, though, not as something to have fun with..right the opposite. Director Meir Zarchi cares for Jennifer and shows this rape as sick and repellent..and, begs to question if this woman is exactly justified in seeking retribution for being dehumanized and abused. Through Keaton's performance we see the stripping away of what made her such a beautiful person. Being robbed of humanity in word is one thing , but seeing a dirt-caked, bloody, naked woman just wishing for the agony of primal man to end so that she can clean up &amp; find something to bring closure to what has just happened through the heartbreaking portrayal of Keaton is another. Keaton gives everything over to this film, and as in other exploitationers, will be given her due at robbing them of what she has lost. It's "turning-the-tables" at it's most vicious level. The castration scene itself packs as much a wallop as her rapes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jenny (Camille Keaton) needs some R&amp;R and some inspiration for her latest novel. So she decides to pack up, rent a nice little wilderness cabin and kill two birds with one stone. Things are going all too peacefully until the day those rowdy locals start harassing her. While sunbathing on a hammock outside and enjoying the silence, two of the local guys start cruising by her on their boat -- a hoot'n and a holler'n! Jenny could have waived hello, maybe even invited the gents in for a cup of coffee or somethin?? Instead, she decides to stick her nose up, and walk back inside. Big MISTAKE! Especially when your a woman, all by your lonesome and very far out of your comfort zone! A day or so later, while bikini clad once more and laying in her canoe, minding her own business- the fellows happen to cruise by once more. This time they decide to rope up Jenny's canoe and drag the poor girl to shore. Immediately, Jenny starts frieken, scream'n the whole cruise back and acting scared out of her wits once they hit the shore. By this time the guys (joined by two of there dimwitted friends) are all fired up. Ya see...they have a "slow" one in the group (Mathew), who also happens to be a virgin that they desperately want to get laid. After some serious peer pressure and taunting of poor Mathew (Richard Pace) Jenny is raped by one of the guys. After the assault Jenny is allowed to walk home, albeit completely butt naked, beaten, and traumatized. After a long stroll through the forest, poor Jenny is attacked again. Jenny finally makes it home, where her attackers follow and decide to have one last "go around". This time Mathew cant resist the pressure and takes a ride himself. The other guys chant and laugh, and one goes so far as to assault Jinny with a glass bottle before slapping her around a few more times. OUCH!After the guys have all but drained themselves they leave. Stopping at the shoreline, it is decided that hey can't just let Jenny live. No, she must be killed. And who better to do it than Mathew, the village idiot. Mathew (against his will--if you can call it that) goes back to the house to finish the job. But he just can't do it, because deep down he's just another good hearted, lovable handicapped person. He leaves Jenny as is, and runs back to tell his homies that he took care of her. Fast forward: Two weeks have gone by and no news of Jenny or her murder has surfaced. This starts to worry the guys, who are just waiting around for the story to break! Mathew continues to state he did kill her, but the boys decide eventually to hop back in the boat and cruise by Jenny's cabin again. During this time, Jenny has recovered, and has been using the last two weeks to get herself back together, and come up with a plan of action. Action of course means DEATH!The boys realize Jenny is still alive after cruising by her cabin (she's on that damn hammock again) and are quite PO'd at Mathew for lying. They are not sure what to do. But Jenny knows what she is going to do.....and sets her plan in motion. One by one she cajoles, tricks, and seduces them before making them pay the ultimate price for her violation. All kidding aside, this reviewer enjoyed "I Spit On Your Grave". I can certainly see how it ruffled some feathers back in it's day. The rape scenes are pretty graphic (especially for it's time), and the brutality of the film is unquestionable. I like the fact that there is no music in the movie either, as it adds to the realism of the film. This is unarguably the ultimate "rape/ revenge" story... and although the revenge portion of it is somewhat "unbelievable" to say the least-- it is a nice ending to this little tale of victimization. Those hicks definitely get what's coming to them. Props to Camille Keaton, a very lovely woman who had some serious cajones' to take on such a role. While it's far from perfect, "I Spit On Your Grave" is a time honored classic in the tradition of revenge stories that has held up pretty darn good over the years. Recommended!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a hard flick to watch. When it was shown in theaters, people walked out after seeing certain scenes. Rape and castration are not everyone's cup of tea.Revenge flicks are hot right now with The Brave One and Death Sentence. Of course, there is the Death Wish series that defined the genre. I originally saw this film after it came out on VHS. I've seen it many times, but that is a long story. I decided to revisit it after not seeing it for 17 years.The rape scenes are brutal, especially the one on the rock. The revenge scenes are also harsh, but satisfying in a vengeance sort of way.Arkansas native Camille Keaton, who is a grand-niece of Buster Keaton, gives a stirring performance as the victim. She even won a Best Actress award at the Catalonian International Film Festival. The rest of the cast only have this one film in their resume.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Repugnant exploitative misogynist trash that has long been a favorite among weirdos and creepers. The "story" is about a young woman from New York (Camille Keaton, granddaughter of Buster Keaton) who goes to the country to write. She's then savagely and repeatedly raped by four men, one of them mentally retarded (charming). Afterwards she gets her revenge. There comes a point where you subject a character to so much brutality and degradation that no amount of revenge will make the experience enjoyable. This movie passed that point with the first protracted rape scene. Yes, first, as the woman is raped three times over the span of forty minutes! It's a disgusting soulless movie with ZERO redeeming qualities. This didn't need to be made and, if you found it entertaining, please seek help. A strong contender for the worst movie ever made, on moral grounds if nothing else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The alternative title is "I Spit on Your Grave" -- great title, along the lines of "I Dismember Mamma." Much better than "Day of the Woman." Camille Keaton is a novelist who rents a summer cabin in the woods in upstate New York, is assaulted by four maniacal rapists, and kills them all, one by one, in revenge.I don't know where to begin with this thing. It's a pleasant location, around Kent, Connecticut. That's one admirable feature. Let me think. Nope. That's about it.It's unimaginable that this film is controversial because it is supposed to endorse rape. It doesn't, anymore than "Hamlet" endorses fratricide. After all, of the four rapists, one is strung up by the neck until dead, and his body heaved into the river. (The heroine yanks his struggling body up off the ground with a line she's flung over a tree limb. He weighs twice as much as she does.) The next rapist has his member surgically removed in a bath tub and bleeds to death screaming. The third gets an ax in the back. The fourth has his genitals mutilated by a speedboat screw. That's not an endorsement of rape. But I doubt that the director, Meir Zarchi, is genuinely offended by that interpretation. As they say, a knock is as good as a boost. And now we have the Millennium edition of the DVD with two audio commentaries.Camille Keaton is young, fair, slender, attractive, and can't act. But I don't want to pick on her. Nobody in the movie can act. I suppose saying that people "can't act" is kind of categorical, so let me say that you'd see equally good performances if you happened to stumble into a high school play in, say, Kearny, New Jersey.I thrilled at the structure of the assault though. The four roughnecks haul Keaton into the woods and one of them rapes her violently. They leave. She struggles to her feet and makes her way painfully through the woods towards the cabin. She's hardly glamorous by now, naked but covered with blood and smeared with mud. She's half way home when she finds them waiting for her. This time they fling her face down over a boulder and sodomize her after beating her some more. They leave. Thoroughly debased, crawling through the brush on her belly, she manages to make it home, painfully picks up the phone -- and has it knocked from her hands. They're waiting for her. They rape her again and force her to commit oral copulation. Then they try to kill her but fail.Let me summarize. The beatings, the rapes, the sodomy, the forced fellatio, are spread out over three incidents rather than one. Why? Because we get three thrilling scenes of sex and violence instead of one. And it pads the movie out to feature length. That's why Hamlet doesn't kill Claudius until the end of the play.No sense sticking with high-falutin' references though. The rape is structurally necessary for the violence that follows. It's just an excuse. First the violent assault, then the violent revenge. It's a familiar structure. Clint Eastwood's "Sudden Impact" -- you know the one, "Make my day?" -- has an almost identical plot, though the structure is varied. Now, if you want to see an artfully done, and thoroughly gripping rape, try Bergman's "The Virgin Spring." For a scene of sodomy that will give you nightmares, see "Deliverance." The photography here is humdrum, but in context that's saying a lot. The director shows us the gargoyle faces of the psychopaths from the victim's point of view. They look like they're doing push ups over the lens. The sound is tinny, even in the Dolby Digital provided for the Millennium Edition. When an actor turns his face from the camera, his voice fades too. In a church, asking for a dispensation from God, Keaton makes the sign of the cross and gets it wrong, unless she is Greek or Russian Orthodox. And it's a Protestant church, with no images and no holy water. When she's holding an automatic pistol on a rapist and threatening him, she gets to cock it twice.Why -- you, the experienced movie goer ask -- why doesn't she go to the police? They would certainly believe her story and collar the evildoers. After all, she's not a black man in Alabama in 1930. She's a young white woman in New York who has been beaten half to death and is dripping with sperm. Well, again, why doesn't Hamlet knock off his uncle? Or why don't the Indians shoot the horses of the stagecoach they're chasing instead of trying to pick off the passengers one by one? She doesn't call the police because if she did we'd be deprived of the scene in which she pulls a Lorena Bobbit on the cretin in the bath tub.It's an execrable film, one which couldn't make up its mind which kind of movie it wanted to be, a fashionable feminist allegory ("The Day of the Woman") or a simple slice-and-dice gore fest ("I Spit on Your Grave"). I wonder who started the rumor that this was some kind of message picture. I'd guess the director did. And it IS a message movie. The message is, "It's exciting to see nudity, sex, and violence on the screen."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Back in high school one of my fellow movie nut friends randomly came in one day with this movie with the cover of a woman's half exposed booty with blood and a knife with the title "I spit on your grave", never saw it, never heard of it, but he told me that I had to see it. So I went home to watch it and man, I don't think I wanted a drink so badly in all my teenage years. This is one of the exploitation films that came out in the 1970's that was porn with a story. Wasn't well acted, not the best made movie, but is always gritty enough to make you squirm. Believe me, I Spit on Your Grave is no joke when it comes to making you cringe, squirm and all those other disgusted feelings.New York magazine writer Jennifer Hills is writing her first novel, and decides to spend the summer in a cottage on a lake in the countryside, where she can write it undisturbed. Three local men, are disturbed by Jennifer's independence, and periodically harass her by driving by her cottage in their speedboat, or making sounds at night. One day, while Hills is relaxing in her canoe, two of the men surprise her in their speedboat, grab her boat's towrope and tow her to shore. As she tries to escape, she's met by the other two men in their group and she realizes that they had planned this abduction. It appears they have plans in store for their mildly-retarded friend Matthew to lose his virginity. Jennifer fights but is chased by the men through the forest. They capture her and brutally rape her; but what these boys don't realize is that they just messed with the wrong chick, she's up for some good bloody revenge.Is it bloody? Yes. Is it vivid? Yes. Frankly, this was one of the first films that really disgusted me, it's poorly acted, poorly edited and one of the worst excuses to put on film? yet somehow in some sick way this is a good cult classic. I think because during the time where The Hills Have Eyes was released, we thirsted for revenge on those who did us wrong. The castrating scene is one of the most freaky scenes I have ever seen in my life, I think I still need a drink.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misunderstood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meir Zarchi's "Day Of The Woman" aka. "I Spit On Your Grave" of 1978 is a shocking and disturbing, highly controversial classic that is vastly underrated and unfairly condemned by many. Many people seem to hate this movie because it is unpleasant to watch. And it is, of course. More than that, it is hard to watch at times, and deeply shocking and disturbing. But how could a film about a brutal rape and bloody revenge not be? It is understandable that some people are disgusted by the gruesome scenes of rape and violence in this movie - these scenes are MEANT to disgust. But the fact that the movie may be too disturbing for many people doesn't mean it's awful.As far as I am concerned, this is a movie that shows despicable acts of violence as disturbing as they are, in a shocking and realistic manner.Warning! SPOILERS ahead!Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton), young New York writer who mainly writes short stories for magazines, has rented a house by a lake in order to write her first novel in the quietude of the countryside. Shortly after her arrival, however, the beautiful, free-spirited young woman falls victim to a bunch of men who abduct and brutally rape her in some of the most disturbing scenes of sexual violence ever brought to screen. After a time of recovery, and only alive by lucky circumstances, Jennifer longs for only one thing: revenge. Bloody Revenge...Camille Keaton delivers an impressive performance as the rape victim who turns into a merciless avenger. The other performances are not too good, Eron Tabor is quite believable as the sadistic and despicable pervert he plays."I Spit On Your Grave" has been accused of promoting violence, which it does not. It has even been accused of promoting rape - people who say that must be out of their minds. In no way does this movie glorify violence. The rape scenes are so disturbing that they're hard to watch at times and the rapes are shown as the despicable, vile thing they are. And even though Jennifer's revenge is utterly understandable, and anybody will of course sympathize with her, the acts of revenge are also very disturbing, and certainly not meant to show violence in a glorifying manner. This movie was in many ways inspired by Wes Craven's underrated and disturbing debut "Last House On The Left" of 1972, and both movies have often been criticized because they were misunderstood. I guess the main reason why this movie is accused of promoting violence must be that some people could misinterpret it. Many critics (including film famed critic Roger Ebert, who hated this film) have condemned this movie because it has been misinterpreted by some people. But is it the movie's fault that it might be misinterpreted (by morons)? If anyone finds anything 'erotic' or 'cool' about the rape scenes in this movie he should go see a psychiatrist. These scenes are not meant to be cool, they're meant to be shocking and disturbing, and that's what they are. They are utterly disturbing, saddening and gruesome and it is beyond me why anyone would see anything glorifying about them.All said, this movie is certainly not pleasant to watch, but it is definitely memorable and original, and accusing this film of promoting rape makes about as much sense as accusing "Bowling For Columbine" of being pro-NRA propaganda, or accusing "Full Metal Jacket" of promoting War. I can understand that some people do not like this film, and those who are sensitive when it comes to violence in films probably shouldn't watch it, but it certainly is an amazing film in its own way."I Spit On Your Grave" may have its flaws, but over all it is an original, shocking and memorable film that deserves to be respected. The mere fact that some people can't handle the violence doesn't make the movie bad. Recommended to everybody who can cope with disturbing films!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Years ahead of its time, perhaps?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after witnessing the result of a gang rape, director Meir Zarchi set out to make a film depicting the ungilded brutality of such an act, and succeeded too well. In his "Day of the Woman," a young woman is savagely and repeatedly raped and beaten by a quartet of yokels who consequently get their comeuppance at her hands. It is so realistic in its rape scenes that it was banned in several jurisdictions. It's often referred to as a grind house film of the female rape/revenge genre, but I feel this is an unfair depiction of Zarchi's intent. Unfortunately, the distributors chose to market is as such, changing the title to "I Spit on Your Grave" and using a trailer that emphasized the sensational aspects of the film -- it doesn't even get the number of perpetrators right. Film critic Roger Ebert famously referred to it as "a vile bag of garbage," "a film without a shred of artistic distinction," "a movie so sick, reprehensible and contemptible that I can hardly believe it's playing in respectable theaters," and that "attending it was one of the most depressing experiences of my life." To be fair, much of Ebert's shock was elicited by the responses of some audience members rather than the film itself, but there it is. This is the movie everyone loves to hate.Now fast forward a quarter of a century and compare the above with Ebert's comments on another film involving the horrific rape and beating of a young woman and an equally graphic act of revenge -- I'm referring to Gaspar Noe's "Irreversible" (2002): "it is therefore moral", "it is unflinchingly honest about the crime of rape. It does not exploit. It does not pander. ... 'Irreversible' is not pornography." Could an additional 24 years of professional film-viewing have made Ebert more reflective and less reactionary? Not a chance. In his review of "Enough" (2002), Ebert wrote in an otherwise thoroughly negative commentary that it is "a step or two above 'I Spit On Your Grave'". So why is "Day of the Woman" a "vile bag of garbage" and "Irreversible" "unflinchingly honest" and "moral"? Because, according to Ebert, the acts in the latter film are shown in, get this, reverse chronological order! That's it; that's the sole significant difference. The moral to be drawn by all aspiring film makers: make an honestly violent film on a shoestring budget with no-name actors and no musical score and you will be reviled in perpetuity as an exploitive, depraved pervert. But make the same film with A-list European stars, include lots of tumbling camera movement, and (very important!) use a nonlinear story form and you too can be hailed as a cinematic genius whose work is nominated for the top prize at the Cannes Film Festival. What utter nonsense! The point of this commentary is not to beat up on Roger Ebert. He is simply a convenient foil who has written reviews of both films that are easily accessible from this web site. The point is to show what I consider the deep hypocrisy of those who denigrate Zarchi's work while lauding the films of Noe, Michael Haneke, and similarly misanthropic directors of the shock school of film, most of whom, notably, are European. I doubt that "Day of the Woman" will ever be added to the National Film Registry, but it certainly doesn't deserve the drubbing it has received. The purpose of the film is to depict the act of rape as the crime that it is, stripped of any rationalization or euphemistic metaphor. In fact, the second half of the film, involving the victim's revenge, has the appearance of being added as an afterthought, one that is necessary to make the film marketable. Moreover, comparisons with Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" (1972) are inappropriate because Craven's film was a direct ripoff of (or, if one prefers, 'homage' to) Ingmar Bergman's "The Virgin Spring" (1960). While "Day Of The Woman" has numerous flaws, it's biggest seems to be that it was made long before such films became hailed as artistic. Rating: 4/10 (by way of comparison, I give "Irreversible" (2002) 3/10).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>honestly, this movie is just silly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I suppose this review contains *minor spoilers*, I say minor because I'm assuming anyone attempting to watch this movie already knows it's about a really long rape scene and then the revenge of the victim. They're probably watching it (like I did) because they heard it was banned in many many civilized countries, and were curious to see what all the hubbub was about. Well, the hubbub's expired - the movie's almost 30 years old, it's badly shot, badly acted, and virtually devoid of a script. I Spit On Your Grave is not even shocking anymore - yes, the rape scene, like any rape scene, is unpleasant, but I'm sure we have seen more intense and more believable performances in, say, Boys Don't Cry, or Irreversible. Plus it drags - it drags for forty unnecessary minutes only to establish the weight of the revenge that comes afterwards. If the rape scene is forty minutes long, then the violence must be appropriately explicit/lethal, in any case more so than if the rape scene were only twenty minutes long - or so goes the argument. The point of this jumbled sentence is that the director stretches the rape scene only for shock value, and then continues to do the same thing with the violence (especially the meandering final scene). I Spit On Your Grave has no purpose, though many read into it complex morality, feminist theory and fancy themes they identified. The movie begs for this kind of reading. It purposely sets an innocent, intellectual woman against a bunch of sexist hicks. You can blab about the animal nature of human beings revealing itself after they've experienced trauma, and nature of justice and so on and on, but the movie is intended for shock. It doesn't explore any of these themes and presents us only with stereotypes. It means to shock and it might have many many years ago. You wanna see a good feminist movie, see "Thelma and Louise." You wanna see a good revenge movie, see "Kill Bill." But I Spit On Your Grave is pointless and dumb, and I don't like any of it (except for the title, which would have been great for a gutsier movie).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" is a really good,powerful film that most horror fans seem to hate.Obviously not a movie for everyone,because it features some extremely brutal scenes of rape and violence.New York writer Jenny(Camille Keaton)rents a country house for some peace and quiet while she writes her first novel.The local retarded boy takes a fancy to her when he delivers some groceries to her cabin.He tells his friends about this and the four of them end up brutally raping Jenny several times before leaving her for dead.She is beaten,kicked,sodomized over a rock,violated with a liquor bottle and forced to perform oral sex while being viciously slapped about the head and face.After recovering from trauma Keaton lures each of them to their deaths,pretending that she wants to have sex with a couple of them.The film has no musical score and director Meir Zarchi uses the silence and natural sounds very well.The infamous castration scene is really sick,but very memorable.The rape scenes are very graphic and realistic."I Spit on Your Grave" is a horror in a truest sense:it does a little but shock and horrify,but it does those things better than many horror flicks out there.It is also a cult classic and should be treated as such.Highly recommended,but if you want to see something even more nasty try to find "Forced Entry"(1972)by Shaun Costello-possibly the most brutal and sadistic hard-core rape/horror ever made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The people who seem to like this movie try and tell us that it is alright to show the degradation this woman goes through because she gets revenge. They want to say that it empowers women because she kills them for what they did to her. While some very basic revenge movies do have the pay off that we are looking for when the victim kills the people who violated them, this movie does not empower anyone. This is sadistic violence followed by more sadistic violence. Any rape survivor will tell you that the way they feel empowered is not by killing their attackers, but by surviving and taking back their life. Even for a rape revenge movie, where we expect a violent revenge, this had our heroine going beyond revenge and acting as disgustingly as her attackers. So she is empowered because she has sex with the one guy that couldn't "finish" during the rape and hanging him right after he "finishes"? The rape goes out of it way to show her naked as much as possible, and to rape and sodomize her in as many ways possible. When we get to the revenge, she degrades herself by putting herself into sexual situations that wouldn't even be possible with THESE idiots. Rape is about power. No rapist is going to put himself in any of those situations, situations that are only presented here to try and titillate the audience. Some say that she has basically lost her mind at the end. How is losing your mind considered empowering. For her to do what she did, or if she has indeed lost her mind or morals, shows that the rapists have won. I just want to make it clear that I like a good revenge movie. I don't mind violence in movies, even sexual violence. But there needs to be a reason for the violence. Irreversible showed how bad violence was whether it was the rape or the revenge. This is simply the worst kind of exploitation film that tries to justify itself by trying to attach some sort of statement.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In reading the reviews, I think it best to dispense with the plot summation. I feel compelled to comment due to how, time and time again, those driven to comment on this lurid, artless film keep missing a huge, glaring point- this film, when it gets down to it, is really more soft-core fetish porn than a film about righteous revenge. 'Day of the Woman' has got to be the cheapest, most cruelly hypocritical tagline ever.The cover art on the video ought to be the first tip off- a woman, scantily clad in something torn and tight-fitting, scratched up and filthy, clutching a machete in her grubby, ravaged hand. But this woman has no face, not even a head, nor is there any man, her presumed rapist who's about to get it, present. The focal point in the picture is her mostly bare back, perky buns and taught thighs, not the woman herself, nor her experience, but her physical, sexual image. How now is that not extreme objectification, when the ravaged body, free from any personality, any human face, is blatantly eroticized- when THIS is the film's visual selling point? This is the absolute farthest thing from empowerment I can think of.In the ensuing- and flimsy- story that follows- precious little time is spent on character development. All we are allowed to know about Jenny is that she is a New York writer who enjoys the great outdoors. Right away we get treated to a full-frontal and fully gratuitous nude scene, and it isn't very long afterward that the gang rape actually occurs. The rape itself is grueling, graphic, and painfully, unnecessarily long- it is this scene, not the killings, that are the climax of the film, indeed almost the whole point. After Jenny, left to die, manages to get it together, recuperate, and exact her revenge upon the scum that did this to her, it's all pretty dull from there on, actually. There is no effort on the director's part to build up any suspense, and the killings themselves are far less graphic and gory than the rapes, less detailed, and surprisingly occupy much less screen time than you expect. Revenge may be a dish best served cold, but Jenny delivers death with no relish, no triumph, no hesitation, or anguish- not one tenth of the emotional energy present during her violent gang-rapes, not even buy the guys getting whacked. Jenny could be knitting a sweater, for all the emotional expression in either her face or voice. Really, these were some of the most boring slayings I've ever seen in a horror film.In the end, it's all about the rape, and you find yourself left with the feeling that this film is actually geared toward men who secretly find the visual image of rape kind of hot, and eases the guilt by letting the lady have her revenge, so they can pretend that's actually what they came for. It was what I, for one, came for, and was sorely disappointed. I can't think of one redeeming thing to say about this poorly acted, visually unappealing, lurid piece of celluloid. In fact, that probably IS the nicest thing I could have said about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Let's grant the Feminists' indisputable point: the men are loathsome swine, the rapes are devoid of eroticism, it clearly shows these cowards' weakness and doubts about their own masculinity. I concur, rape is all about power not sex, I am with you completely. Now, my few feminist readers, could you tell Garth why they felt the need to have her walk about with full frontal nudity for like a half an hour? What would you think if I did a documentary against Nazism whilst wearing an SS uniform the whole time? Would that bother you, say a tad? The movie's cruelty both to the helpless woman writer and her retribution on the slime is why Ebert called this the worst movie ever made. Sometimes, being a philosopher here in pagan land is such a task. Cruelty never justifies cruelty, she could have called the police. We are treated to one shot of her attempting to do the morally correct thing, the phone is kicked out of her hands by one of the pigs. There are no other phones at this location? None at the grocery store where she stalks them? Could we even go through the motions of trying to do the civilized thing, as Kesey does in Death Wish, before we go Jason on their asses? Look, it is one ugly, depraved festival of bathing in blood, enjoying her suffering (carefully concealed but visible), disguised as a C Movie Feminist version of Death Wish (which I also did not care for). Beyond this the acting is below the worst television shows you have ever watched. I cannot tell you how many times I said to my brother,"You know, I would love to see a pretty woman gang raped while she is screaming in horrific pain?" Yes, this is what I like to watch; I would if I was the Marquis De Sade which is who could have made this offensive piece of vile crap. No, she strolls about for a half of an hour with full frontal nudity because the male director was conveying deeply feministic messages, please, stop. Yes, in logic we call that A and ~A= Non Sequitur. The hilarious irony is that her hot body is being exploited by the sexist director who is objectifying her as an 'object of commerce.' I cannot tell you how gross the movie is, it is beyond words. It revels in her torturous series of rapes, one where she is screaming at the top of her lungs. Later, her revenge killings are equally gruesome. My reaction to the movie was to check the Alarm batteries in my home alarm and the deadbolts. Here is a tip from psychology: if you enjoy watching people being tortured, if that is the whole point of the movie, ergo, you have some serious 'issues'. What is disturbing is that this movie was remade a few years back, this is the tame version. Suffice to say, I shan't be watching the 'new and improved' version. Feminists, the few who read my reviews, need to understand that she is naked for a reason and that reason really isn't feminism. It is hard to put the word down on this site: how about male stimulation? The actual word starts with a big E. I understand the genre, I really do, in my youth I watched the Friday The 13th movies. Even those never descended down to this abyss. If you enjoy other human beings screaming in blood-curdling agony for long periods of time, you will just adore this movie. Remind me not to put the cat out. Please, stop with the 'women's empowerment,' a little reflection on the photography, please.

		<fullReview>Meir Zarchi directs this brutal tale of rape and revenge starring Camille Keaton as a woman who is stalked, raped and tortured by four seemingly normal, sadistic freaks. Keaton plays Jennifer, a writer who travels alone to stay at a secluded house. While settling in, she is soon befriended by Matthew, a slow witted delivery boy who gets pressured into joining the sick escapades of his three twisted playmates. While relaxing in a canoe in the lake, the innocent Jennifer is soon approached by two of the sleaze balls on a speed boat and is dragged and then chased and held captive in the bushes. No matter where she goes, the four sickos catch up to her as she tries to escape and continue to rape, beat and torture her before leaving her for dead. Pretty soon, the four louts vanish giving Jennifer plenty of time to pull herself and regain her strength. After talking poor, old Matthew into killing her, two of the jerks pop back on the scene in their little speed boat only to find out that she's not dead. Furious,the three sorry clowns beat the crap out of Matthew forcing him to leave and never come back. Before carrying out her quest for revenge, Jennifer visits a local church where she seeks forgiveness in advance. And now the icing on the cake: The four stupid retards3 get what's coming to them as Jennifer offs them one by one. In the end, she sails off on their speed boat into the unknown. Overall, pretty decent movie. The setting is perfect for the theme of the movie. In addition, the characters including the lead gave good, solid performances.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is critical for the basic human rights in which should belong to the integrity of women. This film is not in reference to militant feminism; it is about a person's right to live upon this planet without risk that s/he will be attacked. Most men will believe that this is a film for feminists (hasten to add there is a difference between militant and feminist) their opinion would be inaccurate. So imagine yourself to be gang raped, buggered up the bottom, raped by implements, left to die whilst your attackers live normal lives. Therefore men this is a film in respect of one's human decency towards others on this planet. Camille Keaton is a brave young lady to act in such a depraved role. I would love to see rape and the consequences of this action be taken seriously in the court of law. Regardless of gender I do not believe people believe this is a serious crime and her impacts on the person. I hope one day we will understand that a rapist will not change and will continue to vent his or her anger until s/he is caught. I do not justify vigilantes however if the courts will not prosecute these perpetrators on lack of evidence, intellectual wording then as a society of increasing moral failings I ask thee this: ''Your child/wife/husband or even yourself is raped what will you do?''</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very controversial in its day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A female writer (Camille Keaton) rents a cabin in the middle of the woods to relax and work on her new book. Four horrendous men (one mentally retarded) attack her, rape her repeatedly then leave her for dead. She recovers and extracts a very violent and bloody revenge on all four.Some people think this is the most disgusting picture ever. The rapes are horrendous and go on forever (25 minutes!)...but it never really bothered me. I was always aware that I was watching a movie and the rapes were very obviously being staged. To make it worse the four guys can't act! It was impossible to take it seriously. Also the movie has a lousy script, HUGE gaps in logic (she never goes to the police???) and the director (who also wrote it) seems WAY too fond of badly focused shots from far away. On the plus side Keaton was great--she gives this picture a much better performance than it deserved. Also it was GREAT to see the guys get what's coming to them. They'll all sick psychotic monsters and deserve everything that happens to them.This picture gained a lot of publicity when it was rereleased in 1980 and Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert tore in it. For its time it was pretty strong stuff but, compared to what we get today, it's easier to handle. It was attacked for being anti-female in some quarters--other people called it a misunderstood masterpiece. It's definitely not a masterpiece but I don't think it's anti-woman either. Actress Keaton and writer/director Meir Zarchi defended the picture saying the rape was vicious and brutal because that's what rape is! Also I always felt the movie was on the side of Keaton. The men are vicious, sadistic jerks and deserve to die. Their killings are just as vicious as the rapes they did--a castration in the tub is almost impossible to watch. Not a very good movie but it's gained a following and there was a remake in 2010 (which I never saw). If Siskel and Ebert had just shut their mouths about this it would have been forgotten.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing Exploitation Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>******Six Out Of Ten Stars******A young woman from New York City rents a rural summer home with the intention of writing her first novel. Four local hicks, including a mentally handicapped man, brutally rape the young woman and leave her for dead. Rather than reporting the rape to the police, the woman decides to exact revenge upon her assailants personally. This film doesn't fit into traditional genre classifications, namely, it's not a horror film or a drama film.This film is raw and honest; and that's why I admire it. It's a low budget exploitation film, that as far as I'm concerned, is fairly well produced considering the size of the budget. Admittedly, the rape scene does come to soon, leaving the later revenge portion of the film to be somewhat cumbersome and even boring at times. "I Spit" undoubtedly would have won over more critics had the filmmakers chosen to capitalize more on the tensions building up to the rape.The reason I took four stars off this film, is because of the aforementioned failure to draw out the most suspenseful part of the film, the time prior to the rape scene. Because once the rape scene hits, and ends, the suspense is just completely lost; unable to even be recovered by the young woman's revenge sequences. The other major error is the producer's decision not to use any non-diagetic music, and is almost as big of a flaw as rushing into the rape scene.I really feel sorry for the reviewers on this web site that claim that they weren't really affected by the brutal rape scenes. I had a hard time watching the rape scenes the first time I viewed this film; there very well done. In fact, I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that "I Spit" was well filmed, directed, and acted! The rape scenes are incredible, in that they are shocking and disgusting. For those of you that don't think these rape scenes are shocking, you have issues.This is a movie about real life horrors. And unfortunately, life is full of horrible occurrences. And it seems to me that movies like "I Spit" draw so much undue criticism because this type of film contends with the terrifying occurrences in the everyday life of human beings. It's not movies about zombies and werewolves that truly scare us; it's movies about people hurting other people in wholly feasible situations that truly scare us and truly offend the MPAA.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words Rape and Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline, a young woman named Jennifer leaves New York and moves to the countryside to write her new novel but her work is interrupted when she gets brutally raped by four men, instead of calling the police she plots her revenge by killing them off one by one."I Spit On Your Grave" is infamous for being banned practically everywhere and earned the Video Nasty title and it's easy to see why.This is by no means a pleasant or easy film to watch, Jennifer (Keaton) is a classy, beautiful, intelligent, sensitive woman and seeing her get raped for 40 minutes (I'm not kidding) was very taxing on me. The men in the movie are mainly caricatures, except for one: Johnny (Tabor). He's given more time to flesh out and drives the message home: Men can do ugly things and feel no remorse afterwards. This guy is unbelievable, he seems so normal but yet he's a monster.The film lightly touches the whole " when a woman shows off her body does it mean she's asking for it" thing but cuts it short when in one of the murder scenes she cuts of one of the rapist's penis in one of the most unsettling scenes ever to grace the screen even the most hardened men will squirm at this scene.Having Jennifer use her sexuality to lure the men into her deadly traps took me by surprise and was an interesting way to approach the revenge theory it worked, all the murders are effective and you really root for her as she gives the rapists they're just desserts.Camille Keaton (Jennifer Hill) is astounding with her breath taking beauty and her moments of terror and fear really hit a nerve with me, Eron Tabor (Johnny) plays his charismatic part well A 70's revenge flick is not complete without the half-wit, Richard Pace (Matthew) convinced me he was a dumb arse. Anthony Nichols (Stanley) and Gunter Kleemann (Andy) have "disposable" written on they're dicks and they do it well.All in all not to everyones taste and I wouldn't recommend it because it is really sick and disturbing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This flick, also known as I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE, garnered a cult following very quickly. Most of the stuff talked about was implied, but you do get to see a naked young woman(Camille Keaton)at various times. Keaton plays Jennifer Hill, an inspiring novelist, on vacation in the woods of Connecticut. A local gas station attendant along with a couple of redneck friends and a mentally challenged delivery boy decide to raise a little hell with the stranger. The young writer is raped, sodomized, beaten and humiliated by the quartet. She manages to gather enough strength to seek and carry out her revenge. Her choices: hanging, shooting, axing and castration. The violence is very brutal and graphic. This film is not for everyone, so be warned. When this was released in 1978, the shock value was in deed higher. Also in the cast: Eron Tabor, Anthony Nichols, Gunter Kleemann and Richard Pace.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ I Spit on Your Grave (aka Day of the Woman) is another film where it's legend precedes it. In fact, the legend may be bigger than the film. Yes, it's deeply disturbing and sometimes hard to watch. But is it a good movie? Again, you must be the judge. It's definitely a simple movie. The first half of the film features the main character being raped over and over again. The second half shows her seeking her revenge. It is a bit similar to Wes Craven's Last House on the Left but there is one big difference. Whereas Craven threw in some bizarre comic moments to try and lighten the mood, there is nothing funny going on here (and I'm not sure it works in Last House anyway). The rape scenes seem to last an eternity. And they are brutal. She is raped by three men and a fourth beats her because he can't force himself on her (if you're paying attention he's a homosexual). I found myself wanting to fast forward but could not. A friend of mine made a valid point in asking if these scenes should be candy-coated and look like fun to an audience, or should they be realistic, hard hitting, and disgusting? Director Meir Zarchi is going for realism. And I think it worked, maybe too well because none of the four men ever worked again. By the time our heroine goes into vengeance mode, you will be more than ready and the men get exactly what's coming to them.</fullReview>

What I noticed in this movie was that the river flows both ways - how comical. This whole movie has godawful dialogue, from top to bottom in every character. What I liked about this movie is that it portrayed a woman as a killer (no, "Psycho" doesn't count). Don't take a woman to see this movie.The other movie "White Trash, Part II" was more enjoyable for its really bad script, the actors, the premise of the movie, the excrement-filled dialogue, the location, etc. Me and my friends who saw this movie still quote lines from "White Trash, Part II" to this day. No, there was not a "White Trash, Part I." I'm still trying to get a videotape of this movie for over 15 years - no luck so far.</fullReview>

Camille Keaton stars in the lead role as the poor victim who following the assault, goes on a quest for revenge and hangs, castrates and chops the 4 attackers to death in retribution. This is another one of the films that started off the "Video Nasties" furore by the media, owing to the extremely lengthy gang rapes which are depicted with gritty realism and are almost unwatchable.

		<fullReview>I watched the VIPCO release of this movie which is supposed to be uncut. It is a pretty well made "rape-revenge" movie, about an attractive young female writer who is going to spend some time alone in an old house in the countryside. Obviously the local boys think she's a tad too attractive and they bring her out in the forest where they engage in raping and beating the woman up. She manages to get back to her house but the boys pay her another visit and treat her no different than the first time. Anyway, she rejuvenate and returns, to kill each one of the bastards who engaged in abusing her. Their "leader" even get his wee-wee cut off and bleeds to dead. Anyway, the movie is pretty well made. I found the rape-scenes to be rather disturbing and you definitely want the rapists to die slowly. So when the revenge comes it's quite a relief. It's an above average genre movie, well worth a look for fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deserves More Positive Attention</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit on Your Grave surprised me; it is far more intelligent and restrained than the hype suggests, and much less exploitative than many mainstream movies today.Camille Keaton's character is somewhat unique, in that she neither a ditsy sexpot nor a humorless ball-buster. Instead she is friendly, feminine and intelligent. The opening scenes give no hint of what's to come. We are treated to lush views of the countryside, see Jennifer settle into the cottage, get down to writing, and make small talk with the locals.All this unfolds comfortably and if you didn't already know exactly what was going to happen, you'd never guess these same men would attack her later on down the road.One interesting thing is the progression that occurs during the attacks themselves. The first time she is raped it is almost like a stupid prank gone too far. Afterwards, stumbling around lost in the woods (which have changed from idyllic to menacing), the men find her again and they too have changed. They are no longer intimidated by her; the power has shifted in their favor, and the more they abuse her the more their contempt for her grows.The violence escalates with the second rape, and by the time she stumbles home and is attacked for the third time, these guys are drunk on power. The awkward, child-like man who couldn't bring himself to participate in the earlier rapes suddenly behaves like a frat boy, doing a hammy strip tease over the still, battered body of the woman he had once shyly admired. They hit her for not being submissive. They hit her for "lying there like a mannequin." They read out the draft of her novel and mock it, laughing.None of this is titillating or glamorized. These rapes are clearly unerotic and humiliating, for the victim, the perpetrators, and the viewer.We then follow Jennifer recovering in the aftermath, and the men getting nervous about the consequences of what they did. I liked the scene of her scotch-taping the torn pages of her draft novel back together, and that we get to see her writing again. I like the quite way she strikes back at her attackers, the way she lulls them into a false sense of security, uses their own arrogance against them, and the way she remains so serene and pretty while making them suffer and beg.The best part of the castration scene is when she goes downstairs and listens to Puccini to drown out the sound of the man's dying screams.This movie does not deserve all the bad press it received. Although made in 1978, the way it tackles the theme of rape is still, apparently, ahead of our time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Raw, Gritty &amp; Disturbing - The Ultimate Revenge Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" (also known as "Day of the Woman, among other titles) is one of those infamous cult-classic exploitation films that has been hailed and hated, and is a very controversial piece of cinema - and deservedly so. The film centers around Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton), a soft-spoken New York writer who rents out a summerhouse on the edge of a beautiful lake to relax and work on her first major novel. While on her way there, she stops by an out-of-town gas station where she meets a few back-woods men working at the place, has a small conversation, and is on her way. One day, while relaxing in a boat on the lake, she is dragged away by a speedboat by the group of men she met earlier, taken on shore, chased into the woods, attacked, and gang-raped and violated repeatedly. She manages to escape and return to the house, where she meets them again, and is again beaten and raped savagely. After recovering from the horrible incident, she decides to seek revenge on the men who hurt and violated her so relentlessly, one by one seducing them, and taking bloody revenge.Probably one of the most infamous exploitation films of all time, "I Spit On Your Grave" is a grueling and disturbing movie. After viewing the first thirty minutes or so, I felt so sick and disgusted that I wanted to take a shower. I had a similar feeling after seeing Wes Craven's "The Last House on the Left", but the violence (particularly the rape) is depicted much more graphically in this film, so I felt even more disgusted. The group of degenerate men in this film are depicted as slummy pigs, and they prove their stereotype by so savagely raping and beating a young woman like they do. The rape scenes in this film are rather lengthy, and are almost too realistic, which is in essence why they are so disturbing. They look unbelievably real, and I was beyond uncomfortable watching them. This film does a good job and showing how horribly human beings treat each other.After the horrible mauling and violation, Jennifer takes a little revenge of her own, and cleverly (and brutally) murders each of the men involved. The revenge scenes are bloody, but not as brutal as the rape. Honestly, I couldn't blame Jennifer for doing what she did. Adding to the disturbing factor, is a scene where Jennifer goes to a church and asks God to forgive her for the murders she is about to commit. The storyline in this film is thin and simple, but is nonetheless interesting and engaging. Camille Keaton plays the heroine well - she's vulnerable enough, but also determined enough, and plays it perfectly. The villains are all good at playing the degenerate men, and the audience is never sympathizing with them (even when Jennifer is enacting bloody revenge on them all). The main reason I find this film so amazing is because of how simple but effective that it is. The cinematography in the film is beautiful. Filmed in Connecticut, the rural country backdrop is a perfect place for the film to take place. The conclusion to the film is abrupt, and takes place on the lake where the initial terrifying situation began, and is satisfying in the end. Also to note, this is one of the few films I've seen without a musical score, but I'm glad that there isn't one. This film doesn't need music to help carry it, and it makes it feel even more gritty.Overall, "I Spit On Your Grave" is a nasty, raw, and brutal revenge-themed horror movie. It is simple but disturbing, and includes some of the most unsettling scenes I've ever viewed in a film of this type. The movie itself is very controversial, and it's quite apparent why that is so. I understand that some people have considered this film misogynistic in nature, but in the end our determined female lead takes the revenge that she deserves, which has me questioning why people think this. Yes, it displays violence towards a woman. But the woman doesn't just sit there and forget that it ever happened - she fights back. This film has a reputation as a "video nasty", and that it is. Recommended for fans of '70s exploitation horror, but definitely not for the weak-stomached. Some scenes are really hard to watch. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wow.....this film pushed boundaries, yes it showed things in a brutal way we might be scared of and realities we don't like to think of, but the important factor of the film is, how horrible rape and violence is and how it can overcome anyone, how people can get carried away, how spur of the moment decision's that you may forget after a day or two can effect the cause of your life.The director does a brilliant job of making the characters as normal as possible, not giving the 'bad guys' a real bad guy edge or 'the heroine' a real heroine feel. He makes everyone appear normal to make the whole damn thing that bit scarier. This works to great effect.The scariest part of the film for me is the eerie sound of the harmonica as a rape approaches, it keeps you on tenterhooks for sure. Matthew is a gullible guy who just wants friends and in a way wants the best for everyone without saying no to anyone which inervertivly leads him to trouble and rightfully so, it displays that you cant get away doing what others want you to do, it doesn't work for anyone. The rape obviously changes Jenny and instead of shooting them all like she could do, she leads them all to a false sense of security then killing when they are at their most vulnerable....perfect revenge perhaps? The sort she could not have achieved for ringing the cops or shooting them all quick. When looking to see what other films the actors/actresses have been in i was surprised to see none of them have done anything, acting as well as direction was perfect in this film as the budget was enough to display real life events not wasting $12 million on a 'jeepers creepers' monster that doesn't delivery half the scare.Overall I would say a worth see movie due to the fact you can see how horrible it is to be caught up in such situation and spare a thought for victims who didn't survive unlike Jenny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very violent image of female empowerment</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit on Your Grave (1978) is a relatively simple story that revolves around a woman and four men. It begins with a woman moving into a summer home. Four random men discover her whereabouts, sneak up on her when she least expects it, and rape and beat her multiple times. Two weeks later, the woman goes back and kills the four men one by one, and the movie ends. Fans of the film have long disagreed with Ebert's harsh review of the movie's moral fiber. Ebert writes, "This is a film without a shred of artistic distinction. It lacks even simple craftsmanship. There is no possible motive for exhibiting it, other than the totally cynical hope that it might make money" (Ebert). Ebert has observably made it known that the violence in this movie, at least in his eyes, serves no purpose and lacks any sort of redemption, but perhaps he has missed some crucial elements of the film.First of all, I Spit on Your Grave is not the original name of Meir Zarchi's film; the movie's original title was Day of the Woman. This tells one that Zarchi obviously had the theme of 'the strength of a woman' on his mind when coming up with the plot and events that occur in the film. While the title I Spit on Your Grave seems to imply that the film has a pessimistic and unwarrantable agenda, the title Day of the Woman inspires feelings of female empowerment. Looking at aspects aside from the wording of the title, the female lead is a woman who travels to a cabin in order to write a feminist novel. If this woman were solely 'going on a vacation,' the film would lose some of its feministic command. So how does the violence in I Spit on Your Grave redeem itself? The film's use of plentiful violence adds extra emphasis to the strong feminist message against the common but inappropriate sexual gazes and motivations of men. Again, this is a movie that is almost completely comprised of relentlessly violent scenes, so if the violence did not exist within the film, the film would not exist, and the attempts to make the audience believe that women can be as capable as men, both mentally and physically, would be lost. Although the feminist message of the film may be slightly skewed because of its popular title, Ebert should have looked into the deeper connotations of the film before reacting so harshly towards it due to its necessary violence.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively deals with a harsh subject, thus those who cannot deal with it claim it "trash", while it in fact is genious</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is one of the most effective films I have ever seen. The horror of rape shown in this film is strong enough to make a great deal of people sick and to inspire self righteous critics (Siskel and Ebert) crusade against the film. Director Meir Zarchi shows the viewer the story of Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton), a strong woman from New York who entered the wilderness to write her first novel. Her experience in the country begins pleasantly with a little small talk with the locals and sun bathing by the river. However Jennifer's peaceful sabbatical is not to last. She is brutally raped by four local men, almost killed. She however recovers and takes her revenge, which includes the most satisfying castration scene imaginable.The reason Zarchi succeeds with his film is primarily the raw manner in which it is presented. There is no external music; all sound comes from the action of the film. Also Zarchi chooses to show the rape scene (over twenty minutes) in real time. The viewer is forced to watch as Jennifer is violated and humiliated. It must however be noted that this is not some sort of twisted voyeuristic film, but instead has the purpose of showing how truly terrible rape is from the perspective of a victim. Zarchi felt it was important to make the viewer look at the ugliness of rape after he and a friend aided a young woman who had been raped in a New York City park.Camille Keaton performs the role of Jennifer at a very high level. She is amazingly convincing in her humiliation, pain, and terror, and later her raging vengeance. During the second rape Keaton unleashes the most ghastly scream in motion picture history, even slaughtering the screams of Marilyn Burns in Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Also, the image of Jennifer walking back to her house from the woods should haunt any viewer, she is in shock and the person she was is gone. The performances of the local men who rape Jennifer (in fact the only men in the film) also are notable. Eron Tabor as the ringleader Johnny effects the viewer to feel vehement disgust towards him. He is a believable angry, misogynistic hick. Richard Pace, playing the retarded man Matthew, manages to be realistic and not offensive or cartoonish in his portrayal of a disabled man. It is also of interest to note that during Matthew's strangulation of Jennifer there was a near tragic accident on the set. Matthew is so credible when he dies of strangulation, because there was a malfunction and he almost was strangulated during the filming.The film peaks as Jennifer castrates Johnny and sits in the basement listening to opera music while he is locked in the bathroom bleeding to death. After this the deaths of Stanley (Anthony Nichols) and Andy (Gunter Kleeman) only serve to drag the film down. One is stabbed in the back, and the special effect is so poor that the back looks more like orange peel. The other rests himself on the outboard motor of Jennifer's boat. She of course turns on the engine. However the film is quickly revived right before its end. Jennifer has a true look of dominance and triumph as she pilots the boat on the river away from the scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pointless trash *spoilers*</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious rape-revenge film that so offended critics and moviegoers at the time of its release that Siskel &amp; Ebert actually devoted an entire show to condemning the movie and the people who were involved in making it. It's about a woman who moves into a country house, only to be first tormented then brutally raped by a foursome of thugs, one mentally retarded. Later, after recovering from her ordeal, she seduces the men one by one and butchers them in various gruesome ways. While it never glorifies rape as many critics claim, it does use rape as a purely exploitive plot device. The sole reason for these horrific scenes of this woman being beaten and sodomized is to give her an excuse to strike back, so we can get to the scenes of her then castrating, hanging, axing and outboard motoring her assailants. Unlike Wes Craven's unfairly maligned THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE has no moral standpoint, no point to make, nor anything to say about its subject matter. It exists simply to revolt and horrify. There's nothing wrong with that. The filmmakers wanted to make a sickening, repugnant movie, and they succeeded. So why do I dislike this movie so much? Simple: it sucks. The acting is bad, the screenplay is moronic, the photography and editing are sloppy, and the sound is muffled and often inaudible (even on Anchor Bay's THX-remastered DVD release).The notion that this movie is misogynistic is a flawed gut-reaction at best. Our sympathy lies 100% with the female protagonist, and the scenes of her being raped are not meant to titillate, but to horrify. At no point is it hinted that she somehow deserves what happens to her. Simply showing a woman being raped on screen does not make a movie misogynistic. The best that can be said for I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is that it dishes out its brutality pretty equally. It has a low opinion of its characters in general, and treats all of them as pawns in a bloodbath with no point outside of making us sick to our stomachs.As I said, I don't have a problem with that, and I think there's something to be said for the simplistic and almost documentary-style approach. But it's obvious to me that the filmmakers knew that the subject matter and extreme nature of their movie would be more than enough to get asses in the seats, so therefore why bother to do a good job? That, to me, is the real reason to take offense at this garbage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Real Representation of Violence and Rape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film is one of few that really bothers to shoot from the perspective of a victim. Most films will use the camera to manipulate rape into seemingly erotic and sexy. Here, you see the pain, you see brutality and you see how dehumanizing it is. The performances are good and the story is non conservative; essentially two acts- action and reaction. A woman who has been raped will often recreate a sexual scenario with the assailant afterwards to feel empowered. It does happen and it makes sense when you have spoken with and experienced such acts against you and your body. Those scenes are not sexy, are not clean and are disturbing. For those who are critical- it is more for the social conscious intellectuals who appreciate Clockwork Orange and Natural Born Killers This film is for those who are willing to accept that violence is not entertaining.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Time to reconsider</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I fist saw this film in 1978, I was astonished and amused at the sheer audacity, the total disregard for conviction, involved in its story and presentation. Since that time, the film has been hated like very few films, primarily by those who assert that it somehow "glorifies rape."Well, not really. Rape and its aftermath, as presented here, are about as "inglorious" and anaphrodesiac as a colonoscopy. The rapes (40 minutes' worth) are, I assume, horribly realistic; the victim's revenge is not. The very delicate and appealing victim, played by Camille Keaton, stands in sharp contrast to the quasi-human thugs that attack her (and attack her, and attack her). Unfortunately, her "delicate" demeanor begins to ring false when she returns to the scene of the crimes and dispatches her former tormentors by such means as hanging, castration, and pureéing with an outboard motor.This was an exploitation film, but it was done in so graphic a fashion that it would, if a true story, qualify as a documentary. (For example, the soundtrack uses no music.) It should not be banned or surpressed, but neither should it be mass-distributed. It will not damage viewers who are not unduly sensitive, although it will disgust them; but it could easily provoke thoughts in a troubled mind that are best left alone. By the way, it is not a hard-core porno film: no insertions pictured, etc. But the average filmgoer is likely to feel sullied after seeing it, and no one under 21 should see it at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just rented and watched this movie just to see what's all the fuss about. So here's what my reactions to it are. It's easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors. The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists. This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film. However, the movie doesn't shock or disturb me at all. It just bored me. This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes. All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time, like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described below.************Contains spoiler************ I find the rape scenes quite tame. I don't know if I have watched the cut or uncut version, if there is actually such a version. I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot. Here's a list on top of my mind.Why don't the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are. That would be an excellent time.Why don't they just gang rape her, instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifer's ordeal by such a long time. It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that way.I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house. Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbeciles.These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right, they shouldn't send a coward imbecile to do the job.Why didn't Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left? Which should be the first thing that pops up in most people's mind, especially for someone who is a writer. Why didn't these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alive?I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him. ************************Ends spoiler************But hey, this movie is not without its merits, Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer, `Why me? Why Me, I didn't even c^m!!!'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever the intention, it's still nothing but rape as entertainment.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's one of the most infamous horror movies of all time and was condemned as an affront to public decency by both Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert. Having finally watched I Spit On Your Grave, I can say that they and other critics were somewhat unfair to this film. It's not the malignant, nihilistic piece of filth they described. What it is?.is boring.Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) is a New York City writer who's rented a summer house in the country to work on her novel. Once there, she's attacked and repeatedly raped by four local men. She recovers and takes bloody revenge on them. That's a succinct description of the plot, needing only the addition that I Spit On Your Grave takes about a half hour to cover each sentence. Yep. The movie spends about a half an hour on Jennifer getting raped 4 times in three different locations and, short of full on penetration, there's really not much that gets skipped in any of the assaults. They are brutally graphic by modern standards and back in the late 70s, they must have been beyond what anyone every thought they'd see on screen.The middle 30 minutes is the only reason I Spit On Your Grave is remembered more than any other cheap, exploitative piece of crap from that decade. The first 30 minutes is literally nothing but waiting around for something to happen and the last 30 minutes is laughably plotted and not any more graphic or memorable than dozens of other violent flicks. Which leads to the question of?why? Wouldn't a 5 minute scene of Jennifer being raped, beaten and left for dead have been sufficient? What's the reason for the character being repeatedly violated over such an extended period of time?The truth is that there is no reason for it. Oh, you can probably come up with one yourself and project it onto the movie but within the confines of the film itself, there is no reason for a nearly 30 minute long gang rape. There's not enough story here for there to be any context or meaning to any of it. Now, I don't think writer/director Meir Zarchi was trying to present rape as entertainment. But he surrounds it with such a skimpy narrative that you can hardly blame people for taking it that way. Imagine a 90 minute movie that had a 30 minute long car chase in it, or a 30 minute long sword fight, or a 30 minute long dance number. Unless the other 60 minutes were quite amazing, you'd naturally think of the film as being about the car chase, the sword fight or the dancing. Well, the other 60 minutes of I Spit On Your Grave is either mundane or ridiculous, making it normal to see it as being about nothing but rape.The reason I don't think that's what Zarchi was going for is how hard he works at sucking any possible eroticism out of the sexual assaults. He films them in a detached, distant, almost clinical way. Those scenes are about violence, domination and degradation and most definitely NOT about sex. Then again, the whole movie is like that, with everything kept at a distance both visually and emotionally. It's a bit similar to the documentary-like style Tobe Hooper used for The Texas Chain Saw Massacre. But whereas Hooper used distance and the bright light of day to showcase bizarre and over-the-top material, the subject matter of this film is depressingly ordinary and it's presented in an even more abstract way, which does not produce anything like the same effect. I sort of look at it as the rapists' favorite rape-revenge flick. They get to enjoy Jennifer's violations in vicious detail, there's not enough story here to make them examine or question that enjoyment, then they can congratulate themselves for not being as stupid as the 4 guys who get killed in the last half hour.My reaction to I Spit On Your Grave was boredom. As horrific as the rapes were, they never made me uncomfortable like the way I squirmed in my seat watching the brutality in the original The Last House on the Left. If I didn't know anything about this movie and were too young to know any better, it probably would have had a serious effect on me. However, I am old enough to recognize this film doesn't have the substance to justify the sensation it's trying to achieve.This isn't a good movie with its excesses. It wouldn't be a good movie without them. The savage criticism it's received isn't entirely accurate, but it is still well deserved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Well Made Revenge Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Finally after many years I got to see the infamous revenge movie "I Spit on your Grave". At first I was apprehensive at watching this, as the numerous stories I had heard about this production and it's graphic rape scenes, caused a subconscious resistance to the material.This did not last long as I soon found myself absorbed in the story. In fact the film is very well made. The cinematography is very good and so is the pacing of the film. There are quiet, pensive moments in the Movie, which is a rare thing compared with the frenetic and frenzied cutting of todays pictures. Also there is a logic to the actions of the characters how ever horrible they might be. The acting is a little wooden in parts but generally passable. Eron Tabor's performance is excellent.There are some gratuitous moments but they are not part of the initial rapes which are intentionally graphic, shocking and numbing. They come once the revenge theme starts to evolve. What most impressed me was the bathtub scene. The male actors reaction is late. That late reaction is very real as shock and pain only begin with the apprehension or visualization of the wound. In a modern Motion Picture that subtlety would be removed and the actor would react instantly thus lessening the impact of this extraordinary scene.This is a good movie. Maybe the subject matter is too intense for some people, but over all, this is a very well Directed Motion Picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Terrific Revenge Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Banned in New Zealand until recently, and very hard to find despite it's release on DVD, "I Spit on Your Grave" is quite frankly a terrific revenge film - nothing more. Sure, there is some rather violent, offensive and terrifying material in the film, but as a whole, the film serves up a great revenge story.I think it is some of that violent, offensive and terrifying material that has made "I Spit on Your Grave" such an infamous film, and one of the 1980's 'Video Nasties'. Also the title "I Spit on Your Grave" is rather offensive in itself. The alternative title, "Day of the Woman" is so much more empowering though, but both fit in well with the nature of the film."I Spit on Your Grave" tells the story of Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton) a writer from New York who goes on vacation to an isolate town, where she resides in an even more isolated holiday home. There, four men attack and rape her at different times during the day (but in each time as a group). The men believe they kill her after the final assault, but the man who was supposed to kill her could not. Jennifer spends a short time recovering from the highly traumatic ordeal, before hunting the men down one by one and brutally slaughtering them without remorse - and why should she have remorse? They showed her none.There's no denying that the death scenes aren't brutal, because they are. As is the rape. Nothing graphic is shown, except for the terror on Jennifer's face, which Keaton portrays well. What is strange however is how quickly it takes her to get over her ordeal and hunt down the men. I'm no expert in rape, and I'm sure everyone deals with rape in their own way, but she seems to recover rather quickly, though there is a comment from one of the men about time lapse, however it is not very clear.The actors who play the men - Eron Tabor (Johnny), Richard Pace (Matthew), Anthony Nichols (Stanley) and Gunter Kleemann (Andy) all do great jobs. Each of them has a distinct personality from the other, though they pretty much all have the same attitude towards women and possibly life in general. What seems strange is how none of the four men have done any other films, and Camille Keaton's movie career never really amounted to much either - is there some sort of Hollywood rule that people associated with this film cannot appear in others or something? If that is so, then it's quite sad, as "I Spit on Your Grave" is in the confines of itself and its genre, quite a decent film. Personal opinion can really only dictate that though, and to have an opinion of the film one really needs to watch it for themselves.</fullReview>

The main character is so beautiful and intelligent to contrast the ugly middle aged rednecks who degrade her sexuality by tantalizing her and ultimately violently raping her. The graphic nature of the rape scenes causes a blood-thirst to arise in the audience as Jenny avenges herself. Each man "gets what he deserves" according to how he violated her. The lack of a film score forces the viewer to be suspended by the tension of the long shots after each rape scene and of the river, and it ends just when it should. Overall, this movie simply employs the horror tactic to represent a social problem within our patriarchal culture, that of the violent exploitation by the Man.</fullReview>

She is set upon by four scumbags and subjected to the most disgusting and protracted rape which takes up almost HALF the film's running time if you can believe it! That alone earns it a place in moviedom's "Hall of Shame." Beaten and left for dead, she recovers absurdly well and plots her revenge. After a make-over and coming back to town looking like Miss USA 1978, she makes-out with the ringleader who fails to recognize her, until that is, she slices off his penis in the bath. It's the high point of the movie as it were! The other three are despatched so quickly and tamely, (presumably her make-over cost so much, they had no budget left to complete the film beyond that afternoon!) one is left wondering simply, "Why did I rent this crap?"Do not watch this with a girlfriend or in fact with ANYONE!

I find that inaccurate considering that only a third of the film deals with revenge. The first two-thirds is the exploitation of a woman being "realistically" raped, sodomized, penetrated with a bottle, brutalized, dehumanized, and left for dead. Now, if that description intrigues you or tantalizes your interest, have no fear, because that is why this film was made. Any claim that this film was about anything more than the exploitation of sexual violence against women to make a buck is both delusional and laughable. Its perversity intentionally caused controversy, which lured the morbidly curious in.

		<fullReview>"I Spit On You Grave" does exude a feeling of authenticity...only because it's made with a complete lack of artistry. It seems hardly "directed" at all; it's as if someone with a portable video camera just happened to be there when some horrific things were happening and, somehow passing unnoticed, managed to get it all on film. The same can be said for the performances; they're so bad they're "natural". Those people certainly don't look like actors, they look like guys randomly picked from the street. But apart from this "realism", the film has nothing else going for it. The bare-bones plot is ridiculously padded out to 100 minutes. The first half is just plain ugly; the second half, a repellent celebration of vigilante justice and cold-blooded murder, is equally (if not more) offensive. Keaton doesn't seem to become a murderess out of rage (which would be somewhat justifiable), but out of outright viciousness and sadism. As a result, we don't root for her, and there's certainly no satisfaction for the viewer at the end. Just a sick and ugly film. (*)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this movie sucks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>dreadful movie. really boring and most importantly - not scary at all. i hate these types of movies - some sociopath (probably psychopath) decided to make a movie that is something that turns him on - watching a woman get brutalized. i have seen some effed up movies where this can work to some extent but the problem with this film is that its just boring and you cant help but think that this is just something that the director/writer made simply to get his own rocks off. i had always seen this video in stores as a kid and finally decided to watch the other night (i love horror - all types - Italian 70s, slasher, 80s,...all types). this movie sucks!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a nasty, nasty movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love horror films, and I'm not squeamish. But this movie I can't imagine anyone enjoying unless they get some slight thrill from watching a woman being raped, whether or not they want to admit it. It's like a very violent porno. And the revenge sequences didn't make me feel any better about it...at that point it seemed more like what I might imagine a snuff film is like...and I don't want to see one of those either! Its violence is too...voyeuristic.It just left a very bad taste in my mouth. And for some reason it's in the drama section at the local video store, it should be in the horror one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a real shocker, no special FX</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a real shocker, extremely violent and realistic at the same time. Although the actors are not pure hollywood, they sound rather genuine. It is ridicolous how people that affirm they can handle any amount of gore or violence get so upset when they face movies like this or Men Behind the Sun. This movie is not only a great rape and revenge, but it's way better than the recent Irreversible, which while a good movie, it has been unreasonably praised by the so called intellectual public, not to mention they added the raper's penis through computer graphics. This movie is excellent and definitely realistic, and I believe there is much to think about it, besides what the same old PC, witch burning, well thinking public says.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly Camp</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had heard that this was a controversial film, brutal, terrible, the worst film ever made, etc. Usually I stay away from slasher, violence for violence sake films and figured this was in that category, so I had no interest in it. Then I got a copy for free and thought, okay, let's see what this is all about. It was so laughable, reminding me of many of the pornos made back during that period (the 1970's). A simple, linear story with the details and dialog probably being "written" as they were shooting with their one (maybe two!) unsophisticated cameras. Not one talented individual in the bunch, direction, camera work, and the acting so badly over the top and ludicrous that you can't possibly take this movie even remotely seriously. It's a silly, campy film but you can tell that they were trying to sincerely do a real horror/revenge film, so I give them high marks for effort. It's the kind of shallow, vapid entertainment that the shallow, vapid high school boys used to enjoy over a few beers and bong hits in the drive-ins back when it was made. I could see how someone might list it as a guilty pleasure: it's rather mindless, primitive, and ridiculously clichéd enough to have the same guilty pleasure one would get from an off color joke. I found the movie so ho-hum that I realized the "controversy" was more absurd than the film itself. Were feminists really outraged by this moronic offering? Did Roger Ebert really call this "the worst film ever made"? (Wouldn't surprise me actually, he's recommended enough real dogs that I think he's become, or always has been, an out of touch ivory tower cinephile who overvalues his own opinions and the general b.s. of the movie world.) It's not realistic in the least bit, so how can you be offended? It's a little like watching "South Park" and thinking that the characters are evil children. They're cartoons, people, a parody, satire, even farce if you will, but hardly reality. I place this silly film in that same category. If what people are offended by are the IDEAS behind the film: brutal rape, wanton revenge then I think what they're really talking about is a desire to enforce their own brand of censorship. True, violence and rape are unpleasant and nothing I care to indulge as entertainment, nor do I watch so-called "normal" television shows that preach a much subtler form of barbaric brutality, often touted and socially accepted as wholesome entertainment, even comedy. But I do not believe they should be censored. Censoring does not stop people from thinking, believing and acting in any specific way. I don't enjoy watching these movies and shows, I don't particularly like them, I think they're a sad indicator of what brutes most people really are despite our facades of civilizations, but if I don't like them I TURN THEM OFF. Very simple. If you want to get angry, get angry at the real brutality that goes on a constant basis virtually everywhere in this hard world. But getting upset over this nonsense? Come on, get real.</fullReview>

Serves no purpose other than clearly influencing a series of the American drama Dexter in recent years. Abhorrent. I question how anyone can attempt to argue this is anything more than an attempt to glorify the abuse of women, even with the ridiculous ultimate tag line of revenge. The fact that this film still appears on TV now makes me more concerned. It turns my stomach to think that this is described by some as outstanding. Nutshell. Sad perverts who fantasise or even have abused women will love this. The rest of us will feel sick to the stomach that for some unknown reason this monstrosity still seems to keep being remade. But then again, we live in a world where people think Hostel is a great movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Spit on Your Grave:The Complete Uncut Edition.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After having read about the film years ago,I have been interested in taking a look at the title,but have stayed away due to how heavily cut all UK editions of the movie have been.Catching me by surprise,a family friend revealed that he had tracked down the complete uncut version of the film,which led to me getting ready to see I Spit on your Grave for the first time.The plot:Wanting to relax whilst writing her first novel, Jennifer Hills rents out a cottage in the countryside.Catching the attention of gas station manager Johnny and his two pals Stanley and Andy,Hills befriends grocery worker Matthew.Unknown to Hills,Matthew is a friend of Johnny,Andy &amp; Stanley.Meeting up with the gang,Matthew lies to them and says that he saw Hills naked.Spying on Hills,the gang spot her relaxing in a canoe. Latching onto the canoe with their speedboat,the gang tow Hills back to shore.Reaching land,the group beat Hills into the ground by hitting her and each of them brutally raping Hills. Believing Hills to be dead,the gang get back in their boat and leave Hills corpse behind.Unknown to the gang,Hills has actually survived their ruthless attack.With the group having destroyed her innocence,Hills decides to get her revenge.View on the film:For the opening 30 minutes,editor/writer/director Meir Zarchi &amp; cinematographer Nouri Haviv (whose cottage was used for Hills location) give the title a relaxed,Country music atmosphere,with stilted wide shots matching the relaxed,care-free nature of Hills.For the harrowing 25 minute rape sequence, Zarchi takes a delicate approach to make sure that every shot in the sequence does not feature any hint of an exploitative nature.Focusing on the torture that Hills is experiencing, Meir Zarchi keeps the rape sequence entirely at Hills point of view.Zarchi expertly uses extreme close-ups and the lack of any music soundtrack to create a horrific atmosphere,as Zarchi's tight shots reveal each of the gang to be disgusting monsters.Pulling Hills (played by an incredibly brave Camille Keaton)out of the decaying pit,Zarchi gives Hills revenge attacks an unexpected elegance,as Zarchi displays a real precession in the editing of the style,thanks to offering brief glimpses of the attacks that Hills kills the rapists with,which allow the viewer to make their own full image of each act of revenge,as Jennifer Hills spits on their graves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Spit On Your Grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This over the top and now quite infamous film can be read on many levels. An attractive young single woman from New York retreats to the country to write a novel where she is subjected to multiple rapes by a group of locals. Wisely they decide she must not live to tell the tale, but leave the murder to the simpleton of the group; he chickens out, telling them he has killed her, and then after taking some time to clean herself up and gather her senses, she sets about exacting a terrible revenge."I Spit On Your Grave" was reviled by the feminist movement ? then in its second wave ? on release. But is this a film that degrades women, or men, or us as a species? Is it an attempt to justify revenge; a warning to men that if you commit rape, this could happen to you; or perhaps a warning that if you do commit heinous crimes it is best not to leave any witnesses?The country hicks in this film were not particularly bright, but neither is whatever message it carries. Yes, mass murder is not the answer to rape, even if revenge is a dish that is best served cold. Better a world in which there is no revenge because there is nothing to avenge. Would that be a much duller world? Hardly. Alas, today's film-makers clearly remain unconvinced.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well done but not exactly a pleasant experience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A budding writer moves away to move to a remote cabin somewhere in New York in the woods, with nothing but peace and quiet. Along the way, she encounters some mysterious men at a gas station. Not too long after, she is harassed and raped by the same men. She goes through an ugly transformation and turns into a female vigilante to get revenge on the rapists. This is one of the video nasties that people have talked about for years. It's up there with Last House on The Left, Virgin Spring, and Deliverance. Ostensibly, it was so bad that Roger Ebert walked out on the movie incensed. He gave it zero stars. With all due respect to Ebert, this movie wasn't made for the public. It's supposed to revolt you and be repulsive. This was never meant to be along the lines of "It's a Wonderful Life" This is a brutal revenge film and that's all there is to it. As far as revenge films are concerned, it succeeds in that aspect. In some ways I can see why it was banned. It's unrelentingly brutal in some scenes and the rape scenes are very hard to endure. I'm talking lengthy rape scenes that can make even the strongest of stomachs churn. The dialog is very simple, perhaps a bit lewd at times, but it fits the movie. I'm a guy and this movie reminded me of how disgusting other guys can be at times. It is a harsh reality of how guys view women at times. I can only imagine how difficult it was to film this movie for some of the cast members. The acting is decent for this sort of thing. Camille Keaton is gorgeous but a solid actress as well. Considering what she had to go through, I wouldn't be shocked if some of the emotion was real. It was a good job on her part. My only carp with her character is that I would have liked more character development. The people who portray the rapists are very good at playing perverted creeps, that's all I'll say. I'll be sure to word this as carefully as possible, but I was highly satisfied with the ending. Those that like violent revenge will be pleased. There isn't much gore, but many unforgettable images. I'll just say a castration is a highlight. This movie won't be for everybody. If you found Last House on The Left engrossing, this will be right up your alley. It's not a movie I make a habit of watching often, but it's above average for what it is. If you have the stomach for it, check it out6.6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Infamous but potent and worthwhile (for some)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Originally released in 1978 as "Day of the Woman" and re-released in 1980 with the more popular title (which writer/director Meir Zarchi hates), "I Spit on Your Grave" is a low-budget film telling a simple story of rape-and-revenge.The film is notorious. Ebert and Siskel railed against it and most theaters refused to show it back in '78-'80. But it was a hit on video and there's still quite a buzz about it over 3 decades later. The film can't be stopped, as Zarchi points out.Since I knew going in that this was a rape-revenge film with overt depictions I was fully braced for the material and therefore didn't find it shocking. I suppose it would be quite shocking otherwise.I should add that the film's not pornographic. In other words, it's not a film to view for porn thrills. The rape/revenge scenes are a turn-off rather than a turn-on.After viewing the film I saw it again with the director's commentary. He has a heavy accent but I was able to adjust. Zarchi is brilliant and offers loads of important details. For instance, he shares what inspired him to make the movie: In 1974 he came across a naked young woman stumbling out of the woods; she had a broken jaw and had been raped by two scumbags. She said they would have killed her but she convinced them she couldn't see without her glasses and therefore couldn't identify them. They then broke her jaw to knock her unconscious so they could make a getaway. She regained consciousness fairly quickly and wisely decided to get out of the area in case they changed their minds. She crawled through the woods to the nearest road, which is where Zarchi discovered her.The film shows that the four rapists are misogynists who feel powerless in their daily lives and are threatened by an intelligent woman from the city. Listen to their moronic dialogue during the fishing sequence. These guys talk about women like they're 13 years old (but worse). Unfortunately, there are adult men like this. It's pathetic.The picture reveals how actions can be misinterpreted by people with sick minds. For instance, the leader of the rapists comments that when Jennifer first came to town and stopped at his gas station she got out of the car and flaunted her beauty. The truth is she just got out of the car to stretch her legs (in a modest dress, by the way) and make some friendly small talk.The film also reveals what's in the hearts of people, including the viewer. For instance, when Roger Ebert saw the film at a theater he overheard a middle-aged man make troubling comments during the rape sequences like, "That'll teach her" and "The others were good (the rapes) but this one's the best." As for me, I was on the side of Jennier Hill. This was obviously a difficult role and Camille Keaton did an incredible job; she even won an award. Camille has a beautiful face and stunning locks of auburn hair. But, at the time, she was way too thin. She definitely needed to gain at least 20 pounds. Shortly after the film was released she married director Zarchi. Although the marriage didn't last, they remain good friends.In any event, in the story Jennifer does absolutely nothing to provoke the abuse of the dirtbags.There's a church scene right before she enacts her revenge where she asks God for forgiveness. The real-life minister of the church caught wind of the nature of the film and contacted Zarchi, insisting that the parts depicting his church be taken out. Zarchi drove out to the church in Kent, Connecticut, where the film was made, and explained his reasons for making the picture. When the minister understood Zarchi's intentions he gave him his blessing.Speaking of the locations of the lush Kent area in Western Connecticut, this is one of the films highlights (I get sick of Southern California locations). In fact, believe it or not, it's one of the main items that prompted me to see the picture as I have personal interest in Western Connecticut.You'll see that the beauty of nature -- the sights and sounds of the forest -- are contrasted by the hideousness of human nature. This is effective.There's no score, even though Zarchi tried to fit music to it. He said it just didn't work; adding music diminished the impact.The film runs 100 minutes and it's all completely realistic until the 73-minute mark where Jennifer allows the mildly retarded rapist get close enough to her with a knife to easily kill her. She later allows the lead rapist the opportunity to get the upper hand (when she gives him the gun). I found this unbelievable. In both cases she could have easily killed the scumbags but instead momentarily makes herself vulnerable to enact a more stylized revenge. I don't believe she would have done this in real life. But some would explain her actions on the grounds that she now no longer feared death (since she had been so close to it) and was willing to gamble with her life in order to punish the criminals in a way more fitting than a gunshot.Some may object to the idea of Jennifer having the strength to pull off the hanging, but Zarchi defends it by pointing out "hell hath no fury like a woman scorned." There are a couple other weak moments. In one close-up it's clear that the retarded guy's glasses are fake. Also, during the infamous bloodbath scene, wouldn't the guy realize that he's been castrated right away (regardless of whether or not he's having an orgasm)? Dumb.Still, this is a necessary film. It counterbalances beauty with the hideousness of rape and supports the only just punishment for such extreme sins -- death.GRADE: C+ or B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Absolute Worst Film Ever Made or Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of the review says is tall. Words cannot even describe the moronic acting and plot of this movie. If it were made with some believable acting and realistic revenge methods, then perhaps the message would have been sent to the audience. Instead we has some of the worst low life actors ever that no real person could identify with. Spoiler Alert starts here (if you care)Let's see where do we start? 1. Jennifer in getting revenge on the delivery boy lets him have intercourse first with her before she hangs him. Having sex with someone that has raped you, I do believe would be the last thing on your mind. 2. She gets rapist #2 to go for a drive in the country, pulls out a gun on him and has him get undressed. Instead of shooting him, she puts the gun down and takes him to her house for a bath. Like, he could have strangled her then and there, but no he goes back with her and she does then take her revenge in the bathtub. Absolutely comical. 3. Then rapists #3 and #4 head up river in the boat to nab her. Rapist #3 gets out of boat and leaves rapist #4 in boat. She swims underwater and jumps in boat. He stands there and lets her push him off. Like a normal rapist who wanted to kill her, would punch her senseless, and then drown her. Not rapist #4. So then she gets in boat and drives the boat around him. Rapist #3 comes out from hiding with the ax. She drives the boat toward him and he gets bumped and drops the ax in the boat. Right! Then she goes back out. As she does brilliant rapist #3 swims to rapist #4 to save him. Naturally, she drives the boat toward them and buries the ax in rapist #3's back. Then to rapist #4. Couple more loops around him in the boat, then she stops the motor. He climbs, of course, not on the side of the boat where all normal people would, but directly on the prop. Jennifer disposes of him with a pull on the starter cord. (Spoiler alert ends here)Moronic acting with a moronic plot earns this movie the worst ever. Don't waste your time even thinking about seeing it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not The Abomination You Might Be Expecting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the most notorious and controversial pictures ever released, and sporting a reputation of the very worst kind, "I Spit On Your Grave" is a film that I had long put off watching. Originally released in 1978 under the tamer title "Day of the Woman" and rereleased in 1980 with its more infamous, expectorated appellation, the film has since angered critics, incensed feminists, appalled viewers and been banned in at least a half dozen countries. But I suppose that morbid curiosity, an interest in cinema history and an admiration for the picture's lead actress, Camille Keaton (grandniece of Buster, and whose previous performances in a pair of earlier Italian horror films, "What Have You Done to Solange?" and "Tragic Ceremony," had greatly impressed me), all got the best of me, with the result that I found myself plopping the current Anchor Bay DVD in the other night. And you know what? To my great surprise, I find the film a lot less objectionable than I'd anticipated, and more artfully put together, too!As most exploitation fans already know, the film gives us the story of Jennifer Hills, an attractive writer based in NYC, who rents a summer home in the country (the film was shot in Kent, CT, on the Housatonic River) in order to write her first novel. The rest of the film is easily synopsized: Jennifer is brutally raped four times by a quartet of goons over the course of three discrete back-to-back-to-back interludes. (Joe Bob Briggs, in his Anchor Bay DVD commentary, tells us that this extended rape sequence goes on for a staggering 25 minutes, 14 seconds!) After slowly convalescing from her trauma, Jennifer drives to the local church, asks for forgiveness, and proceeds to slaughter all four men by hanging, castration, axing and disembowelment. The end.Anyway, unpleasant as the proceedings in this film are, I do not find "I Spit" to be morally reprehensible in the least bit. Jennifer's rape is as UNerotic as can be, and is assuredly not intended by Israeli screenwriter/director Meir Zarchi to titillate or arouse the male viewer; indeed, Zarchi supposedly came up with the idea for this film after helping a real-life rape victim who was crawling out of a NYC park. If his intention here was to show how emotionally and physically devastating such an experience can be, he has fully succeeded. And Keaton does a simply terrific job at portraying Jennifer's trauma. Just look at her stagger and crawl through the woods after her second rape; naked, dirty and covered with blood, a look of abject shock on her face. I would like to see Meryl Streep do a better job in a scene like this, or even to demonstrate the courage to attempt it! And another thing: Jennifer is no helpless shrinking violet in this film, even before the rapes, and afterward, when she turns full-blown avenger, she is as fearless and righteous in her wrath as any feminist could hope for. As Joe Bob shows us over and over, the film is most emphatically shot from her point of view; we are meant to sympathize with her and root for her. The quadruple vengeance that she dishes out is a horrible one, and we the audience had to be set up for it by the sight of a quadruple atrocity on the part of the men in order to forgive her. As the film's famous poster once proclaimed, "This woman has just cut, chopped, broken and burned five men beyond recognition...but no jury in America would ever convict her!" And other than the fact that Jennifer only kills four men and burns none of them, that statement is essentially true."I Spit On Your Grave" also surprised this newcomer by being a lot more professionally produced than I had expected. The picture looks just fine, Zarchi (who would go on to marry Keaton) evinces a sure hand in generating suspense, and the four young men playing the goons (Eron Tabor, Richard Pace, Anthony Nichols and Gunter Kleemann) all do fine jobs at making us detest them. Interestingly, the film features no music whatsoever--nada--and those viewers who have seen the similarly tuneless Alfred Hitchcock classic "The Birds" may recall how effective the use of sustained silence can be. So just how does "I Spit" stack up against other cinematic visions of rape and revenge? Well, it's not nearly as artful as Ingmar Bergman's "The Virgin Spring" (1960), of course; somehow, not even close to the repugnance level of Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left" (1972); not nearly as disturbing as Aldo Lado's "Night Train Murders" (1975); and not quite as sophisticated as Abel Ferrara's remarkable "Ms. 45" (1981). Still, I insist that the film is not the abomination that you might be expecting; it is certainly not a pleasant thing to watch, but I sure am glad that I finally screwed up the courage to catch this unjustly maligned film.And one more thing: I really do think that Joe Bob Briggs is a national treasure. His commentaries are always insightful, droll and amusing, and his defense of the film in question is a compelling one. I think I enjoyed watching "I Spit" even more the second time around, with Joe Bob's witty comments helping to take the edge off. He calls "I Spit" "one of the most underrated movies of all time," and darn it, the man might just be right....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What to say about this film that hasn't been said already? Obviously we're not in 1978 and the impact of the the infamous rape same has been muted by todays standards of shock and tolerance. Look no further than 'A Serbian Film' with it's baby porn. However the scene is still jarring and the performances are all good across the board. The story is basic but effective and even as basic as it is it has been used over and over and over again since then. Most notably in 'They All Must Die!' you just simply take out the rednecks and swap in street thugs, you take out the back woods and you put in the ghetto. Point being this film has clearly influenced another generation of filmmakers and is still talked about today in circles of film buffs for a reason.

		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" is one of the classic horror movies and this has to do with a woman who has been raped, humiliated and hurt by a gang. Then they left her for dead but she has survived and she will take her revenge about all of that.It's a very nasty film that shows us the real face of some things such as rape. I also think that because in this movie there was not many visual effects because of the evolution of technology those years, all of that film seems more real than other horror movies of these days.Finally I believe that this movie in comparison with the new version of it is really different and that was something that makes it unique.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you can make it through the first hour, it becomes a different film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just watched this film and it really stuck with me. What could have been a standard 1970s b-movie film is somehow elevated above its terrible acting, poor sound quality, and sensationalistic violence to make empirical observations about sexuality, revenge, personal identity, transformation, friendship, gender roles, and morality. This isn't your standard horror film.Let's get this out of the way: the rape scenes are horrible to watch, but without them, we can't buy Jennifer's subsequent transformation from quiet writer to cold-blooded killer. In any other film, after such an incident, she would have endured years of counseling and eventually come to terms with what happened; instead, after the ordeal, she meets the men on their own ground by becoming as bad as they are, and worse. The bathtub scene isn't just horrible to watch, it's her victim's slow realization of what she did to him that makes your blood run cold. She's every bit as ruthless as Judith beheading Holofernes. It's easy to see why this film should have made such an impact in the 1970s with its overtly feminist themes: women were tired of being marginalized by men, an explicit metaphor of which can be found in the first hour of this film. After some soul-searching, Jennifer becomes her own woman, and regains her world using her sexuality and newly minted cruelty. Camille Keaton's face is marvelous in the scene where she's in the hammock by the lake as Andy and Stanley go by; her expression looks like it's chiseled in marble, and she looks like a spider waiting for her prey. I don't know how she does that with her eyes, but you can feel her rage and power.One of the most extraordinary bits of dialogue is when Johnny begs for his life in the woods, claiming that it's Jennifer's fault that she was raped because she is beautiful, and men by their nature desire beautiful women; this is the crux of the film's feminist statement, and is the kind of deterministic thinking that allows Jennifer to carry out her revenge without any guilt, especially when it comes to hanging one of her rapists , a man with diminished mental capacity. But on top of all that, it's somehow satisfying to watch her put Stanley and Andy through the same torment she endured, a satisfaction that is lacking in the crop of Saw films with their complicated, hackneyed moralism.Despite the ultimate empowerment of Jennifer, you'll never see this film on Lifetime, but its universal themes certainly place it several tiers above your standard horror film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I Spit On Your Grave' is among the most controversial films of it's era and genre and has probably been more discussed than it had any right to. It's an example of a film that has been scrutinized as an example of the degradation of society's values. It's the kind of movie that has been used to promote the idea that horror film goers are nothing but slack jawed dinosaurs who go to films to be aroused by sex and violence. In short people are far more interested in what 'I Spit On Your Grave' represents rather than what it is. I'll tell you what it is, a pretty poorly acted thriller with no momentum or real story. It has horrific acts of sexual violence but they don't propel any deep catharsis...One thing that can be given to 'I Spit On Your Graves' credit is that our sympathies are always with our heroine Jennifer. In my opinion it would be pretty hard to argue that the film is designed for the viewer to subconsciously live through the eyes of the rapists because great care is made to shown that the rapists are villains. Jennifer is put through absolute hell. The infamous rape sequences which take up a large portion of the film are really difficult to sit through. They are played for nothing more than disgust. So I can't really call 'I Spit on Your Grave' a traditional exploitation film because rape is portrayed as it really is, an ugly horrendous crime. There is no sugar coating or theatrics here. And so kudos to the film. The problem is though is that because the acts of violence are so powerful and brutal that the catharsis has to be as powerful. It isn't. 'I Spit On Your Grave' is a pretty poor exercise in storytelling and character building. All the characters here including our lead Jennifer are pretty stock. You cannot have stock characters in a story like this. It is completely irresponsible to do as a storyteller because the subject matter is so charged.It would be one thing if the rape sequences were exploitive but they are played dead seriously. Seeing these horrors enacted by walking talking set pieces is jarring. It's a matter of seeing the strings being pulled by an inept storyteller. The film has the great luck of having casted a brilliant actress in Camille Keaton who gives one of the bravest performances I have seen in a film like this. I have no doubt that she must have struggled to find motivation in the midsts of such a script that is completely on autopilot and yet she is able to find a sense of pathos with the character. It was a challenge because the dialogue and character development are completely stock. The fact is the story of rape-revenge is not a new concept, it goes back to Greek-Roman drama. My personal favorite Shakespeare play, 'Titus Andronicus', delves into the cruelties of the crime and how it scars the psyche. 'I Spit on Your Grave' does nothing new with it and really just tells the classic formula for all it's base value. I agree with people who say that this can become the basis of a strong feminist story. It isn't here despite what some of the film's defenders say. The horrors of the crime are very real here but there isn't any build up or aftermath and thus there is no catharsis. That is what makes this story so endearing. The gaining back of power through blood. Jennifer never really had much power to begin with because she was a cliché. Although the rape scene is horrific, her rapists have no power because they are stock characters. The rape sequence is unforgettable and Camille Keaton gives a pretty salvageable performance but ultimately the movie is useless as a narrative and sociological piece because it's a bad 70's movie dealing with ideas it doesn't really have the intelligence to comprehend. I'd recommend Julie Taymor's 'Titus' or 'Salo' as examples of when this subject matter has been translated right to film. Sexual violence has great weight and you have to acknowledge that weight when making a movie about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie as a child in the early 80's and being a little freaked out by the subject matter at the time. The bathtub scene stuck with me for at least a couple of days. When I saw the title pop up on Netflix streaming, I decided to give it another go.Times have changed. It was so boring I ended up fast forwarding to the few "action" sequences. Compared to the real life gore and brutality available to anyone who wants to search enough on the interwebz, this might as well have been a children's cartoon. Gore and torture porn movies are going to end up being a thing of the past. Whenever I feel like losing a little more faith in humanity, I can always watch clips that don't last more than a few minutes and don't include a crappy story or bad acting. Skip this one, and the remake, and the sequel to the remake. Zzzzzz.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even speaking as an aficionado of the sleazier side of cinema, this viewer can well understand how the notorious "I Spit On Your Grave", a.k.a. "Day of the Woman", will repel some people (including, famously, Gene Siskel and Roger Ebert). It's rough, gritty stuff, and quite slowly paced to boot. It's also obvious, and repetitive. Still, its crude and direct power is impossible to deny. Whether you like, loathe, or respect it, you don't forget it. However, the idea that it's anti-women is false; if anything, it's a pretty scathing indictment of fragile male egos and faulty male thinking.The lovely Camille Keaton (granddaughter of Buster K.) is a real trouper in the role of Jennifer Hills, an author retiring to the country to start work on her first full length novel. There she makes the acquaintance of some bored locals, led by Eron Tabor as the domineering Johnny. They start harassing her, and soon graduate to full-out raping her...more than once. When they assume her to be dead, she uses her time alone to recuperate and plan a nasty revenge.The rape scenes in this film *are* admittedly repugnant, but writer / director Meir Zarchi isn't out to romanticize or eroticize rape, but rather portray it as the truly ugly act that it is. Jennifer goes through so much hell, and ends up looking so rough, that it would be just about impossible not to feel for her. So when she goes after the depraved quartet of men, you *really* want to see her mess these guys up. Not even simpleton Matthew (Richard Pace), who has more of a conscience than the others, is going to get off easy.Zarchi does achieve an unfortunate level of realism by having all of this play out without a principal music score, and gets utterly convincing performances out of his actors. Tabor may well remind the viewer of the similarly sick character of Krug, played by David Hess in "The Last House on the Left".Effective without necessarily being "enjoyable", this landmark film is one of those things that trash fans should see at least once. It's not well rated by everybody, but people may want to check it out for themselves in order to make up their own mind.Seven out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A notorious and brutal revenge horror that lives up to its reputation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having only recently seen the original 1978 film and then the 2010 remake for the first time, the review and comparison here is untainted by having an unrealistically nostalgic view of the original.As a long term horror film fan, I have always found sexual violence especially difficult to watch. It is arguably an odd point of view for a horror buff, but if there is going to be sexual violence, it should be central to the story or point of the film, and is probably why it took me so long to see this or the remake. In this film of course, the point is crystal clear: Revenge. It has long been debated as to whether this is simply a disgusting and brutal exploitation revenge horror, or whether it contains some sort of feminist empowerment message. My view is definitely the former, as the horror is too sustained and harrowing to claim any moral high ground. However, what elevates this as a visceral film experience is that the 'victim' uses her own power of seduction and emotional manipulation to exact her revenge, just as her attackers use their power of overwhelming physical strength to violate her in the first place. While extremely hard to watch, it gives the film an incredible potency as the events unfold, right up to the closing credits. The original 'Day of the Woman' title in this context is arguably more appropriate, however, 'I Spit on Your Grave' clearly packs the punch that was intended to promote the film at the time. The no-budget, no-score and primitive special effects actually add to the unflinching brutality of what unfolds, giving the film a cut-with-a-knife tension and almost documentary like realism. If you are able to sit through the film to the end, you cannot help but feel sympathy for the victim and empathy for her subsequent actions. Something that is sadly lost in the recent remake.This was never going to be fun to watch, but as a classic and notorious revenge horror, that has divided viewers and critics for decades, it is an essential watch for any discerning horror film fan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gang rape is always a scary experience for someone. The horror, the pain, and humiliation one can endure. Especially for the writer from New York name Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) who goes to this cottage in Conneticut to write a novel. Her appearance catches the attention of the local gas station attendant, two other men who don't work, and a grocery delivery man who has mental issues. When the word is out on her, the three men watch her every move. The two slackers get on a motor boat, and tow her canoe to the forest where the the gas attendant lays in waiting. They tore off her bikini, and rape her. The simple one gets the chance to do the evil deed, but can't because the other three were watching him. Then they offer him a chance to have her killed. But rather than killing her, he just smeared her blood on the knife. He was later beaten up for lying. While she was re-cooperating from the trauma, Jen decided to fight back. She would later find out that the attendant is a family man. He would learn the hard way about hanging around slackers could cause him to be amoral. Jen would trap the attendant, force him to strip, and lure him to a bath in the house. She grabs the knife, and emasculates him. That became famous 15 years later in Virginia. Earlier, she drew out the simpleton, and hanged him after sex. She got even with the rest, the best way she can. I Spit on Your Grave is a movie to be reckoned with. 4 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood thirsty revenge lover's tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit On Your Grave is a 70's cult film, of an aspiring novelist who exacts the sort of revenge most of us feel, appropriate in this case, an equivalent form of justice. That's if you watch this movie. We so much woo our sexy victim on in her revenge exploits here. These four hillbilly guys, one retarded, who gets the lighter punishment here, do her over three times, that watching these prolonged rape scenes, parts of them, an uncomfortable view, leaves us drained, as well as a tad annoyed. We really want these men to pay, so when we get to the point of their demises, it becomes all worth it. The movie moves at it's own pace through it's 101 minutes, the acting, low key, dialogue, short, sufficient (remember, less is more) the sound very bad, or I should say the absence of it, fits the film's mood and its, surrounds, bringing a great deal of suspense with it. One scene I won't mention, I couldn't re watch after a second viewing but I'm alright now. Check out it's sequel that's actually an improvement on this one, but I'm more partial to watching the original, it's last line unforgettable. But really a shoddy movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bloody Revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cult classic, I Spit on your Grave features Camille Keaton as Jennifer, a writer seeking solitude in order to write a novel. She finds a cottage in an isolated area near a lake. She stops at a gas station, and the rocket scientist, Johnny, fills her up and leers at the sexy young woman. His trailer trash buddies, Stanley and Andy, have no jobs and hang out at the station. Jenny orders groceries and they are delivered by a simple minded guy named Matthew. He is tricked into raping Jenny , as part of a vicious assault. They give him a knife and tell him to kill her, but he can't do it. He wipes the knife in blood and says that he killed her. After a few days, the victim plots her revenge. Number one is Forrest Gump, the delivery boy who is easily seduced to a location near a tree, where Jenny slips a rope around his neck and hangs him. Johnny is number two. With a gun pointed at him he is led to a bath tub, where, at the height of ecstasy, a knife is used in an extremely painful manner. The last two prove to be a challenge for our young vigilante; but be brave, all ends well. The lead actress is the granddaughter of Buster Keaton. He might be spinning in his grave. A remake was done in 2010, which is fairly similar.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what all the fuss was about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So this is it, the infamous Day of the Woman a.k.a. I spit on your grave, banned in several countries and considered the worst movie ever made by Roger Ebert. The last fact was enough for me to want to see it, since I often noticed that my taste in movies is largely the opposite of Ebert's. Meaning a lot of movies I like were absolutely pulled to pieces by him, and most I hate he loves - especially with horror movies.So needless to say, I went in with relatively high expectations, but I should have known it wouldn't hold up to them. First off let me say, all this fuss is completely unjustified. Same as with a lot of banned movies from that era, you will find yourself wondering why. Sure, the rape scenes are fairly gruesome since it's rape, but as for the violence, you can see a lot worse in newer movies, among those some that are hyped by Ebert. On another side note, Ebert's hypocrisy becomes very apparent in the accolades he gives for Irreversible, another rape-revenge flick with a painfully extensive rape scene, but this one loved and revered by critics. But I digress.The plot is easy enough, as should be expected with the rape revenge genre. A woman moves to a vacation home somewhere on the country to finish her first novel. She encounters several of the cracker inhabitants of that town, who seem immediately sleazy and unlikable. They hit on her in increasingly menacing and threatening ways until they - relatively early in the movie - abduct and gang rape her. IMDb tells me this is the longest rape scene in movie history, and indeed it seems a little too drawn out, but I guess it's supposed to highlight the brutality of the experience - very successfully. Afterwards, she takes revenge on them, and that's basically it.On the plus side, the Camille Keaton's performance is really very good. It's a shame that she apparently became known as the woman in that rape flick, and didn't seem to get a lot of acting gigs afterwards. The rest of the cast is largely unremarkable, but not particularly bad either. The setting is beautiful and forms a stark contrast to the gruesome events. The cinematography is decent considering the low budget. The revenge scenes are largely gratifyingly violent but not particularly gory by today's standards. On the negative side, she gets naked a few times more during her revenge, which seems unnecessary - but then again, it is kind of an exploitation flick. The audio was really bad, again, to be expected given the low budget.Overall, the movie is not nearly as bad as people would have you believe, but it's not all that memorable either. To be sure, I strongly disagree with people who claim it glorifies rape and violence against women. The rape scenes aren't in any way erotic, and the rapists aren't people anyone can identify with - they are sleazy, ugly, and altogether unlikable.Mainly, this movie made me wonder why everybody hates this, while Irreversible was highly acclaimed. One reason might be that the fact that the wrong guy is killed in Irreversible plays on European and liberal's sensibilities regarding the death penalty and violence in general which always works well. Also it is artsy made by artsy people, what with the reverse chronological order and Cannes regular Vincent Cassel. But more importantly, I think the key difference is that in Irreversible, it's the boyfriend who takes revenge, while in Day of the Woman, the heroine is an independent woman who takes matters into her own hands. This is just something that doesn't sit well with the general public, but neither with most self-styled feminists, who like to see raped women as helpless victims who need others to care for them. In my opinion it is that, more than anything else, which makes people like the one movie and hate the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a lot of fun, not slick entertainment, but very effective.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to admit, there are parts of IPOYG that are so draining and demoralizing that I was compelled to turn on Joe Bob Briggs' audio commentary to get the nasty taste out of my mouth. JBB adds a lot to the experience of watching the movie, and I would definitely recommend getting the DVD edition where he is part of the "extras".As for the movie itself...it's painfully amateurish in some spots, painfully effective in others. The rape sequence itself is brutal, ugly, and not at all sexy or erotic - no snazzy camera angles or orchestral stings or lighting filters to muffle the ugliness of what's going on for the camera. It goes on and on for something like 20 minutes as the victim staggers home from the initial assault only to be attacked twice more (one of those inside her cabin - easily the most heart stopping moment in the film).The 3 revenge scenes, while lurid, are IMO sequenced less effectively than maybe they could have been. While the knife-in-the-bathtub scene is startling and nasty in its coldblooded heartlessness, it came too early in the film and probably should have been the last act of revenge instead of the 2nd. The showdown by the river doesn't make a lot of sense and is pretty weak; apparently Camilla's character was counting on the 1st guy not being able to swim and the 2nd guy being a fumble fingered oaf who helpfully drops his axe into her boat when he gets bumped. Rather than being drawn into the scene, I kept thinking "Swim to shore, you idiot!"...probably not what the director was hoping for.Some of the acting is actually pretty impressive. Camilla Keaton is consistently watchable and believable from scene to scene, and the gas station guy is interesting.Worth watching if you have a strong stomach for violence and ugliness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever you do, don't "Spit" on this movie... yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a 26-year-old male."I Spit on Your Grave" (a.k.a., "Day of the Woman") is a film that people either love, or really, really (really) love to hate. The film packs a visceral punch to the senses, considering its extremely low budget, performances from no-name stars, and awkward script-plotting. But "I Spit on Your Grave" appears to be most famous for the rightful controversy it's generated, rather than for any strides, however marginal, it may have made in progressing low-budget horror films in the 1970s.I've sat through most of David Cronenberg's films.I've sat through all of George A. Romero's zombie movies.I've sat through Eli Roth's "Cabin Fever" (2002) - which has the ghastly imagery of a girl shaving scabbed flesh off her legs etched permanently into my mind.I've sat through all seven of the "Saw" movies.I've sat through "Martyrs" (2008), which writer-director Pascal Laugier says he loathes himself for making yet appreciates the high level of creative freedom he was allowed to have on its production.I've sat through the ending sequences of Takashi Miike's "Audition" (1999).I've sat through what is arguably the grand-daddy of all modern-day gore movies, Peter Jackson's "Dead Alive" (1992).And I've sat through this film, which film critic Roger Ebert has called his "most hated movie" and has been behind efforts to get the movie blacklisted, banned, or both (whichever comes first, I guess).I think getting the movie blacklisted/banned would be a disservice to anyone who's even *curious* about what it's about, like me. It's a movie that deserves to be seen by the curious and those who also like exploitive low-budget horror films. Writer-director Meir Zarchi has fashioned himself a low-budget exploitation horror film that you'll either love, hate yourself for loving, or end up really hating it and hating yourself for even watching it.I don't feel bad after watching this feature, but the one thing that bothers me the most about "I Spit on Your Grave" is its disappointing third act. To understand why the third act is disappointing, you have to remind yourself about the events that lead up to it. Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton, grand-daughter of Hollywood acting legend Buster Keaton) is a New York City writer who retreats to a backwoods cabin to write her first novel. (Let me say this: Camille Keaton has to be one of the bravest actresses to ever appear in a movie - period, especially after this film.)Zarchi (who was later married to Keaton for three years between 1979 and 1982) is good in building up the tension of these early scenes with no musical score or anything to really signify or suggest the horror he is about to unleash upon Jennifer and the audience. He also has a good eye for the country and the outdoors: the outdoor cinematography is utterly beautiful and he uses this scenery to great effect in later scenes; it's just a shame that the magnificent splendor of this outdoor scenery hides such a terrible inner ugliness that ultimately comes to claim Jennifer's innocence, purity, sanity and to its greatest extent, her soul.A la the oh-so-familiar "Deliverance"-/"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"-inspired set-up, Jennifer is repeatedly beaten, raped and otherwise humiliated quite brutally by a quartet of backwoods locals in this film's most talked-about, 25-minute rape sequence (which is as raw and unflinching as anything you'll ever seen in a horror film). Afterward, she systematically seeks revenge against them one by one by taking each of them out in some spectacularly gruesome and creative fashions.There is something to be said about "I Spit on Your Grave" being released the same year as John Carpenter's "Halloween" (1978), the most talked-about horror film of that year. This film doesn't reach that level of artistic integrity or creativity, yet some film critics, analysts, and historians agree that "Halloween" (and pretty much every slasher film released afterward) has some sort of sexist slant in its subtext regarding young people - largely beautiful women - being slaughtered mercilessly for being pretty, promiscuous, and readily rejecting and/or humiliating the young men chasing after them. And yet all too often at the end of most horror films, the only survivor (if there are any survivors to be had at all) is, in fact, a woman.Even though "I Spit on Your Grave" was apparently released theatrically one month after "Halloween" in 1978 (and it's highly unlikely that Marchi could have seen the film to steal some of its ideas), it does something else uncommon in horror by giving us a female protagonist who is victimized BECAUSE she's a woman, and her attackers figure her for an easy score because she was "giving them signals" for the fact that she was: A) showing off her legs in a short skirt when she first arrived in town, B) she wasn't wearing a bra either, C) she was seen skinny-dipping in the river early on in the film and, D) she was laying out in her yard sunbathing in a bikini. In other words, she deserved what she got - simply because she was "asking" for it.Up until this point, the movie appears to be something you've probably seen on Lifetime, but then the third act comes around and suddenly Jennifer's a one-woman army taking out the bad guys one by one. Some people say that as a result of her actions here, she's some kind of feminist avenger. I have no problem with Jennifer being seen as a feminist icon; my point is, her transformation from victim to vigilante is too swift, too convenient, and is sort of a let-down in the end. That's my only real gripe with this picture.But I will say that after everything that happens to her earlier in the film, I couldn't wait for these redneck punks to be dealt their just-desserts just the same.8/10</fullReview>

I would recommend watching the remake before viewing the original, you will appreciate the original better. The grittier coloring from the 70's makes the whole film seem more surreal and kind of "romantic". Camille's petite frame makes it all more exciting seeing a petite female exacting revenge on four men makes the tough chick in me to be saying "hell yes"! Go get them guys they deserve that kind of punishment.

		<shortDescription>Artless trash or gritty morality piece? You decide.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many viewers have found the movie's in-your-face nastiness to be courageously raw, while many others saw the whole thing as merely crudely made and relentlessly trashy. ISOYG has been condemned by many prominent critics, notably Roger Ebert, and it is difficult to argue that this picture is NOT simply tasteless exploitation, yet it has its defenders as well, and they are surprisingly staunch. One problem is that the movie lacks the technical polish necessary to pass as anything other than bargain brand exploitation fare. Lighting, composition and camera-work are crudely functional but artless, and the script largely ignores the issues it raises, such as whether sufficient provocation fully justifies vigilante revenge. It just goes ahead and plays out its nasty morality tale of crime and punishment in unflinching near-documentary fashion. The centerpiece of the film - the extended gang rape of a city woman by a group of backwoods lowlifes - is one of the most painful things any audience has ever been asked to sit through, and many did not. In its original theatrical run, many viewers just walked out at that point. But the rape sequence, shocking as it is, is never presented in a titillating fashion; the movie at least is NOT violent pornography as was once alleged. It's a crime thriller and we are meant to cringe when its big crime is shown in all of its horror. The second half of the movie shows the victim-heroine of the piece stalk her captors and symbolically vent centuries of feminist anger at male victimization in a bloody revenge spree. Or is this just more exploitation movie-making, with no genuine social relevance or resonance? Several issues need to be addressed by any defender of this picture. There is no character drama here for the viewer to enter into or sympathize with, but was that by design, perhaps as a way to distance or disassociate the audience from the events depicted or just the result of incompetent scripting and unskilled performances? The rapists are so dim that had they committed no crime one might instead simply feel sorry for them. Their conversations are beyond banal, and their crime is motivated by boredom as much as anything. Perhaps herein lies the true horror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is not a horror movie, beyond the borderline of horror, though I watched it to trace Camille Keatons drift away from and out of horror. She was in What have you Done to Solange and Fredas Tragic Ceremony of 1972, and a few others, but this is six years later and something has changed. From being the very icon of fragile awkward vulnerable teenage beauty she now gives off that aloof sense of self-possession bordering on smugness that of course irritates most humanity like hell. The effect is completely different, and changes ones feelings about her. The movie is mainly a painfully prolonged almost documentary back and forth of rape and revenge. The rape scene is actually three scenes in which Keaton is reduced to a pulp. This involves some very graphic stuff which startles one because it is the very opposite of pornography as her bruised nakedness becomes a sign of abject victimhood that should make you sick (if it doesn't, you might have a problem, and the fact that her husband directed the movie has to be considered very strange). That is, there is no nudity per se in the movie, its all violated nakedness which goes beyond horror into straight crime. And then rather implausibly she stays put in her cottage, pulls herself together, and then enacts a four stage revenge sequence in which she uses sex and seduction as a lure (no posttraumatic stress disorder here) then hangs and castrates (as part of a handjob) two rapists, axing and drowning two others. By the way, all the men are laughable Italian stereotypes of backwoods Americans (I mean would you take a bath with a woman who half an hour before had pointed a gun at your privates). Keaton gives a little smirk of satisfaction at the end of the movie, but you wont be smiling. In this movie, she has lost a sense of the limitations placed upon her as an actress by her peculiar body, resulting in something, but its hardly a movie.</fullReview>

No, not at all (but for those who read his review, you gotta admit he had one of the funniest experiences ever in that loud theater). I've seen worst and with bigger budgets which must be considered since most people think that lack of money equals trashy films. But, this was one of the scariest or nastiest things I've seen? Never! It's so bad that it's almost good to some but if you're brain is alive there's no chance to like something like "I Spit on Your Grave" (aka "Day of the Women"). I believe that the merit of really enjoying something is to make you feel something, or to make you learn something or even think about things in a different perspective. Movies might change or not your life but at least it must leave something with you, otherwise why like it? My problem with "I Spit On Your Grave" is that it didn't gave me anything I was hoping for, in fact it didn't gave me anything except some depressive thoughts and a strange desire to sleep during its slow parts. Don't think I'm insensitive, it's quite the opposite. But I've seen the theme better developed and less exploitative and it worked. Has anyone heard of "Sudden Impact" where Sondra Locke gets revenge of her rapists and at the same time is hunted by Dirty Harry? Way better than this! This 1978 silly movie goes for the absurd in its story of a woman who kills four guys who raped during her staying in a small town where she went to peacefully write a book. Here's the contradictions: the director does not use soundtrack except for one music here and there, and his intention is to shock the viewer giving the sense of realism (it worked in "The Exorcist" but not here). OK, but on the other hand he directed some of the most inefficiently rape scenes ever filmed with the actress seemed turned on with one of the actors (notice her body in the first abuse scene, it simply happened); the way those abuses happened (first comes one guy from the group, then they walk away and comes another guy and they keep walking and doing this again and again. In real life, the whole gang would do that at the same time and at the same place without letting her walk home). It's just bad.For those who saw impact in those scenes, I say this: I haven't seen much in here but perhaps my level of psychopathy is on higher range or something. Just kidding, but the only films who impress me on the subject are "Irreversible" (nothing is more shocking than the 12 minute rape scene filmed in one long take), "Accused" and "The Virgin Spring" (even being made in the 1960's there's something that makes me paralyzed). In "I Spit on your Grave" the actors weren't convincing enough, they were ridiculous in those fake moments. The coolest thing about this flick is the revenge and the way she kills those guys, the part everybody awaits just to see how horrific she can go. Again, the realism escaped with making of Jennifer coming back to those guys, totally hot seducing them and killing them. What kind of stupid thing was that? You can leave those bad scenes in the project, add something here and there and even so this movie would flop. It lacks of purpose, meaning, intelligence, things that can make a good film being good. I mean, girl gets brutally raped, than she goes on a rampage against the ones who did it, and that's it. If you want to take almost two hours of someone's life at least have the decency of giving something in return except just some weak gore and lousy violence.In its transitions between one scene to another the movie is dreadfully slow that it puts you to sleep in minutes. As a horror it's half scary; as a comedy it gives some laughable moments with the virgin guy; as a drama it's somewhat depressive but completely irrelevant. Passable. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing, But Still Not Completely Awful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie after watching the remake and I liked the remake better. This is unusual for me. I usually find the originals of films to be better in the sense that they were made with more care and creativity, considering most horror classics were made with little or no budget.Unfortunately for "Day of the Woman" as the director Meir Zarchi prefers, I did not enjoy it. It was a little dull, unsettling, and shocking to see that she was not only raped by four people, but also that the rape scenes are very, very long and detailed. I found this to be overkill. I was also very displeased with the writing and the plot in general. I found that I didn't care for the characters or their deaths because there really wasn't a back story. They all seemed like generic, sociopathic rednecks with little to no personality. Even the heroine is dull-witted and completely unobservant apparently, as she attempts to run away from her attackers only to be "surprised" when she finds the others watching her with little attention. This movie isn't good. It isn't very spectacular with it's special effects and it wasn't very well acted. Although, without films like this to push the boundaries of what is socially accepted in America and what isn't, we wouldn't have the graphic films we have today! (Such as Hostel, or even this films remake.) This film plays a role in shaping cinema, but it is a very small role indeed.) THREE OUT OF TEN.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This notorious exploitation flick from the late 70's is a rip roaring feminist revenge film with extra girl power to spare. Directed by Meir Zarchi and starring Camille Keaton (granddaughter of Buster) this movie delights in mercilessly brutalizing its characters and the viewers.It tells the story of Jennifer Hills, an independent New York City woman who rents a vacation home out in the country to write her first novel. Upon arriving in "Hicksville", USA she is greeted by three lowlife locals and a retarded man who delivers her groceries. The men decide to play with their new friend, and it would be safe to say that they don't play very nice. Over about a 20-25 minute period Jennifer is harassed, repeatedly raped, and left for dead. That would be putting it mildly as the brutality has a documentary like feel with nothing held back. Keaton gives a courageous performance that required a lot from her. The physical and mental strain of this role is enormous. After her ordeal she limps and crawls back to her cabin only to find the men waiting for her and is subjected to one final desecration. After she heals her physical injuries she starts to plot her revenge. It's like she is reborn as a woman on a mission and possibly a little crazy. She calmly and coolly plots and carries out her revenge on the four men who attacked her.The four perpetrators are your stereotypical country folk just about on par with those of "Deliverance". They seem to have no moral center or conscious for that matter. While the only one that holds back is Michael, the retarded guy, but he finally gives in and takes a turn. Jennifer uses her body and sexuality to get her revenge on the guys who actually go along with it. The men in this movie are dumber than the trees in the forest and are portrayed as savage beasts only interested in fulfilling their basic human desires. Jennifer might have had a sort of mental break from reality as she kills the four guys in such an icy cold manner it's quite disturbing. This movie has been serving up controversy for over 30 years and is still shocking today. A remake was released in 2010, but this is a film that could never regain its original brilliance. Just like every other remade and "rebooted" horror movie, it just can't compare to the original and it is only around to cash in on the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things I like about "I Spit on Your Grave" ...........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, the film delivers exactly what is promises, a rape-revenge movie of extraordinary frankness. The movie does not need a ton of night scenes, with someone jumping out of the dark to create tension. In fact, "I Spit on Your Grave" is almost entirely filmed in broad daylight. The acting is somewhat rough, yet seems totally appropriate, and the photography is excellent for an exploitation film. In the end however, I believe the movie's greatest strength is it's raw treatment of both victim and the rapists. There have been many imitators, none of which have captured the savage brutality of "I Spit on Your Grave". - MERK</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A serious movie, despite its grindhouse trappings...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With its deliciously nasty title and salacious video sleeve, Meir Zarchi's (arguably) misunderstood drama I Spit on Your Grave was bound to get caught up in the moral panic over horror videos in the early 80s. There is no doubt about it, though: Zarchi's film is at times incredibly unpleasant to watch ? I'm referring, of course, to the lengthy series of graphic rape scenes that make up around 20 minutes of the movie's first act. However, if one can overlook the length of this section (to which I will return shortly) then hopefully one can see I Spit for what it actually is: a well-shot, well-paced and intensely dramatic movie. Perhaps if the film hadn't been given such a sensationalistic alternate title it may have developed a more serious reputation; saying that, its undeniably exploitative plot and the overall effect was always going to work against it.The plot of I Spit is both rudimentary and highly familiar: a beautiful writer, Jennifer Hills (Keaton), arrives at an idyllic country retreat to write her next novel. There, she is harassed and ultimately attacked by a group of moronic louts, who think they've left her for dead at the house. However, Jennifer recovers and, without even bothering with the police, plots her violent revenge...There was a time when defending this film would cause intense suspicion, but thanks to the passage of time and a glossy Hollywood remake, the original can now be defended without being branded a sick individual. First, let's consider the film's few flaws. A suitable starting point would be the duration of the rape section, which is for many viewers unnecessarily long. I'm going to gloss over the issue of eroticism, which is neither the point nor the effect of this section (granted, this is true of the video sleeve), an argument which has already been convincingly won by academics such as Carol Clover. What is open to debate, though, is whether this sequence needs to be so long. Jennifer is raped not once but on four separate occasions, each sequence more traumatic and horrific than the last. On the one hand, one can argue that the length of this section is a crucial misjudgement on the director's part, a misjudgement that opens him up to the charge of morbid fascination with the act of rape. This sequence would probably be just as harrowing if it was cut down to ten or even five minutes, but in its uncut form it does seem unnecessarily long. On the other hand, one can argue that a rape scene should not let the viewer off the hook; surely the point is to emphasise the ugliness, the gruelling nature of the act? Indeed, it is only the audience's alignment with Jennifer (rather than the rapists) that stops this sequence from being gratuitously long and leering. However, the one major flaw in the movie is the character of Matthew, the halfwit 'village idiot' character goaded by his friends into raping Jennifer. While there is nothing inherently wrong with this from a thematic point-of-view (Straw Dogs uses this motif to add complexity to a debate about human nature, for example), here the character comes straight out of a Farrelli Brothers movie: with his buttoned-up shirt and sailor hat, Matthew is a teenager's caricature of a 'retard' rather than a convincing character. This is not to say that the other gang members are brilliant portraits of rural cretinism (here the film certainly suffers in comparison to Deliverance); they're not, but they are sufficiently realised to explore male 'pack' types: the alpha male, the sadistic right hand man and the sheep who mindlessly joins in, all of whom (in this movie) see rape as both sport and as a means of suppressing (or taking out their resentment on) intelligent, independent and successful women.Did this film deserve a place on the DPP list? Obviously this was (and still is) strong stuff, but it is certainly not obscene. More to the point, neither does it merit censorship in today's more liberal climate; the BBFC's decision to trim the rape sequence is unlikely to reduce its impact on actual or potential rapists, who would presumably find it stimulating regardless. One thing is for sure, if you are avoiding this film under the misapprehension that it is sleazy, rape-condoning trash, you may be surprised to discover a movie of considerable intelligence and skill inside the lurid packaging.Film: **** Nastiness: ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My second favorite Rape/Revenge movie originally titled "Day of the woman" which is probably the most notorious one of them all. It certainly is the one that set the standard for this type of flick and it perfectly fits the criteria of rape and revenge in every way since its the woman who does the revenge and she is actually raped instead of being tortured or something like that. The movie starts with author Jennifer Hill leaving her New York place to go to a cabin in the woods to finish her first novel. Well it doesn't turn out that well and she gets gang raped by a bunch of retarded red- necks with to much time on their hands and as you all know there will be a revenge(oh what an awesome revenge that is).I'd rather not spoil anything but there's one scene that I have to mention and that is the infamous dick slicing scene. Before seeing this I had just watched Hostel: Part II and that also has a castration scene(in high-definition all gory details 100% visible) but that didn't really have much of an effect on me(aside from a comic effect) cause it happened so suddenly and there wasn't really any build up. But with I Spit on Your Grave the scene is just so tense and a perfect example of less is more because you don't actually see any wounds being inflicted you only see blood which makes it just so much more horrible. The movie also holds the unofficial record of the longest on-screen rape with 25 minutes which is probably the main reason its so hated among certain people (they actually had to cut 17 minutes of footage for an R- rating). Acting in this film is a lot better than you'd expect and its also very well made especially for an exploitation flick and its actually kind of artsy. The film also has a strong feminist undertone and is mostly shot in the rape victim's perspective.I Spit on Your Grave has gotten way too much censorship compared to other similar films like "Ms .45", "The Last House on the Left" or "Thriller - en grym film (Thriller: A Cruel Picture)" not to mention "Jungfrukällan (The Virgin Spring)". Highly recommended for fans of exploitation,horror and rape/revenge. Watch it if you dare!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not for everyone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A brutal film that remains the most notorious of the incredibly controversial "rape/revenge" horror sub-genre, I Spit on Your Grave makes The Last House on the Left look like The Benny Hill Show. The plot is simple ? a woman is raped... she then carries out her revenge on said rapists.The violence depicted, rather than being gratuitous entertainment, is disturbingly effective, particularly during the first act as the unfortunate protagonist undergoes several brutal attacks. But worry not, her assailants soon get their just desserts, and if any women feel outraged by the acts performed in the previous scenes and want the male audience to squirm just as much, your wish is granted.While this film is far from enjoyable, it is not your average exploitation movie and the uneasy feeling you might have while watching it is exactly what is intended in a film displaying the horrific experience of a rape, and it is not surprising that writer/director Meir Zarchi never broke into the mainstream. Sadly I find this hard to recommend to anyone for any reason other than curiosity for such an infamous film, and it is definitely not suitable to watch on a date.5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Buster Keaton granddaughter spits on your grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meir Zarchi's Day of the Woman, better known as I Spit on your Grave was a longtime banned VHS in the UK. Later passed by BBFC like Evil Dead (laugh) and The Last House on the Left to name a few 'video nasties'.It's a basic tale also written by Meir Zarchi, a New Yorker Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) rents a lakeside cottage in the woods of Connecticut, however, later is she gang raped and thought dead. However, alive and recovered she takes her revenge against the rapists.Those who say it's a feminism film are off the mark. It's nasty, needless and arguably gratuitous exploitation. The rape scenes are graphic and I feel unfairly more intense than the revenge scenes later. A product of its time and made to shock, it certainly does that. It's not a film I would want to watch again or have in my collection. However, I'm sure there is a strange audience out there who would.The film is well constructed and directed. The locations are for the most part picturesque and ooze the 70's vibe of that time gone by, in contrast,the lack of a music score sinisterly adds to the realism of the barbaric violence. The cast are below average, however, the unknown lead Keaton gives an amazing performance, and it's a shame she's only known for this film. As a side-note I was surprised to find out that she is the granddaughter of actor Buster Keaton.Only watch for curiosity, Keaton's performance or possibly the revenge kills. That said, it's not recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Day of The Woman", or its lovely alternative title "I Spit On Your Grave", is truly the epitome of incredibly sleazy exploitation movies, but really there's nothing wrong with that. And I can even say there's actually some talent involved here. The rape scenes are incredibly uncomfortable and nasty, which I suppose is a thumbs up to the director. And I was in fact quite amused by the eccentric gang rapists and the completely off the wall conversations they keep having throughout. I could even laugh at the nerd if it wasn't for all the rape in this movie. I thought the whole rape thing would be handled pretty discretely, but these scenes go on like forever. The movie has an incredibly raw, mean feel to it, and it did manage to keep my attention that way. Well that and the pretty creative gore scenes it had in the last half hour, including the infamous bathtub scene. Perhaps a bit poorly executed, but shocking nonetheless. I just really love this movie for some reason.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has become one of the most controversial films ever released in North America. It features a very prolonged gang rape where the victim, intended to suffer the ultimate penalty of death to protect her attackers, finally escapes only because the retarded individual detailed to kill her did not understand why, and failed to carry out his mission. After she recovers physically the mental scars are such that she can only think of revenge, and eventually she goes to a church to ask for absolution for taking the law in her own hands before killing all four of her attackers. These brutal and degrading events provide a synopsis of the complete film which has nothing in it that could conventionally be called entertainment. Many viewers called it misogamist, some felt it encouraged extreme male superiority views, others that the latter part showed it favouring feminine empowerment. In practice the story is presented essentially in a documentary style, not from the point of view of either assailants or victim. Its author and director has related how he was once instrumental in providing assistance to a girl he found in some bushes who had been gang raped, and left with a broken jaw. His horror both at what had happened to her, and at the way the authorities responded when she reported the rape, led him to appreciate how such a victim could be traumatised to the point of becoming mentally unbalanced. Gradually these thoughts coalesced into a script for a story designed simply to depict the reality of the utterly mindless violence experienced by the victim and of its effect on her psyche. Clearly this is a valid subject for either a book or a film, equally clearly reading or viewing such a work would not be enjoyable; and if the characters were real enough could prove very distressing, severely limiting its audience. Ultimately perhaps this audience could even be limited to those perverted enough to identify with the assailants, so enabling them to gain some sort of pleasure from watching the ongoing suffering. This seems to be the assumption made by Roger Ebert who described it as the sickest film ever made and attempted to have its screening halted. His review reported that when he saw it some men in the audience were applauding and cheering the attackers on. If such perverts were the only people likely to view the film it would be better for it not to be screened.It is a valid point of view even if only a small proportion of the audience falls into this category. After Kubrick's "Clockwork Orange", which also featured graphic scenes of rape and violence, was released these were a significant number of violent crimes in England, which exactly copied the scenario of the film. This was reported to Kubrick who in response withdrew the film from distribution there for a number of years. But logically if such films cannot be shown because of fears about their impact on the sanity of unbalanced characters in the audience, the same would apply to news stories about violent events such as accounts of torture, massacres, suicide bombers and all too often genocide. We must keep what man can do to man firmly in our attention if its total unacceptability to all normal people is to have any effect in restraining those not blessed with even a modicum of normal humanity, and there is no other method of restraint which can be effective before rather than after these individuals go off the rails. A different reason for putting a ban on this and similar films is an assumption that there are basic universal standards of taste which would justify it. But this does not follow even when there is nobody who enjoys watching them. Who enjoys watching newsreel shots of a major earthquake with the survivors attempting to dig into the ruins by hand to rescue their loved ones? Distaste does not universally lead to rejection; the wish to remain well informed forces us to watch, and sometimes even to join, or at least support, the work of rehabilitation.I watched this film largely to find out why Roger Ebert wanted to prevent it from being shown, and now feel sure his reaction was due to the behaviour of the fellow members of his audience, not to the nature of the film. Most people would not want to watch it, but they are free not to. It is no more unpleasant to watch that many other scenes depicted on television and even though watching it was unpleasant I am now glad I did so. I am probably more aware that if I see a girl alone who looks spaced out, it just might be because she is not on a drug trip but needing help and support. Ultimately this is not a bad thing. Another good reason to see it is the tremendous performance by Camille Keaton - her grandfather 'Buster' was noted for the discomfort and pain he accepted whilst making many of his films, Camille was certainly a chip off the old block and could only have endured what she did because of a conviction that in the long run it would make a small contribution to the evolution of a more caring society. As to the film itself, I felt the rape sequences, which were almost documentary in character, did not comfortably integrate with the revenge sequences which were made less realistic and more stylistic by attempts to bring out the almost unbelievable egos behind the behaviour of the rapists. Otherwise it was very well made.I do not feel it would be appropriate to give this film an IMDb rating. but I do recommend it without reservation to those who feel, despite the comments above, that they still want to see it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nothing better on a Saturday afternoon than a good exploitation film. Today's pick came from the heap of DVD's sitting on the shelf that I had never gotten around to throwing in the player while curling up with a warm blanked and a case of 12 of my favorite friends. The lucky entry was 1978's, I Spit on Your Grave. When released in 1978, the film was banned in many counties (it is still banned in countries such as Australia to this day) and it has never been shown on television. I Spit on Your Grave stars Camille Keaton as Jennifer Hill, a NYC writer that rents a cabin to finish her novel. But when four locals look for excitement, Jennifer will be the victim of heinous rapes and beatings which will leave her on the brink of death.We get introduced to the four villains early in the film. They all hang out at the local gas station where Jennifer stops for gas. The town idiot (Matthew) quickly takes to the beautiful Jennifer and when he reveals his infatuation to the three other hoodlums, they devise a plan to trap the young writer so that they all could take turns raping and beating the helpless woman. The initial rape scene lasts over 20 minutes and is brutal and graphic in its depiction. Keaton will spend most of the film completely naked and running or struggling to escape her captors and calling her 'brave' for her performance of over 30 years ago might be an understatement.With barely a moment to catch your breath, Jennifer makes it back to her cabin where she is raped and penetrated repeatedly ? once with a bottle. When the four men have completed their day of terror, they retreat back to their boat and convince Matthew to go back and kill Jennifer. Matthew is unable to bring himself to stab the defenseless Jennifer and his reservation will eventually lead to his death.Once Jennifer recovers from her wounds, she is quick to go all Death Wish on their asses. She stalks and plans to kill each of her assailants in brutal and gruesome fashion. Matthew is the first to go. He is the lucky one as his death is a simple hanging. Her second victim could only wish to be hung. As Jennifer uses her sex appeal to lure one of them back to the cabin, they both enter the bathtub where Jennifer pulls a knife and cuts off his penis. The ensuing blood loss will lead to the second of the four deaths need to fully avenge herself.The last two deaths occur in the water with one being one of the more memorable scenes in exploitation history. Jennifer drives a small motorboat while holding an axe over her head. When she catches up with the near drowned prey, she drives the axe deep into his back. The waters turn red. Jennifer has her revenge. In 1978 when reviewing the film, Roger Ebert said, "There is no reason to see this movie except to be entertained by the sight of sadism and suffering". Hell yeah! And it was great. All 100 minutes of it.www.killerreviews.com www.robertsreviews.com</fullReview>

She hires a riverside apartment in upstate New York to finish her book. She begins to attract the attention of a number of rowdy local men. They Manageg to catch Jenifer one day and strip her naked for the village idiot (Matthew) and rape her. Jennifer is later attacked and raped a further two times by the four men. But Jennifer slowly recovers and in her twisted, psychotic mind, she then begins to seek revenge on the four men who raped her. This film featured a lot of strong sexual violence and strong nudity, it was one of the video nasties that were banned in the 1980's. I found most of the sences in the film to be quite shocking to watch at times. but i enjoyed the revenge senses that Jennifer did by getting her own back on her attackers.

		<fullReview>The title should be I Spit On Your Grave as the title Day Of The Woman masks this blood fest as a feminist piece. Make no mistake, neither gender comes out of this movie with any respect intact. If you feel that a rape makes it OK for someone to viciously murder four men and have her be anything other than a monster, you are fooling yourself. This movie does glorify her "victory". The final shot is of the woman lifting her ax into the air. She is woman, see her kill. Of course, the writer only lets this woman have any kind of strength after four men give it to her. So, women are weak until vicious men give them strength? This is what you people call "a good movie"? When I told a girl about this movie, she cheered. Why? Because those demon men were shown a lesson by an angelic woman. This movie plays into rigid gender clichés worse than any I have ever seen. Make no mistake, people like this movie because of how vicious it. Don't be afraid of that, don't label it as something that it is not. You think that it would be nice to see this happen to certain people. If you really want to see a movie that explores this subject, I suggest the similar Ms. 45. That movie pulls you down with it, but it never pretends to be anything that it is not, a bloody revenge movie. This is an immaturely shot, badly acted(Camille Keaton stares blankly for an hour and a half), and exploitive movie. But I have never forgotten that castration scene, if it makes you feel any better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective Horror Film... Not Sure I Want To See It Again, But...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE (3 outta 5 stars) Probably the sickest, most brutal, sadistic movie about rape ever made. Taken on its own terms, I suppose that the filmmakers' claims to it being a story of "female empowerment" can't be totally dismissed. The movie certainly doesn't try to "glorify" rape... it is portrayed so graphically and in such horrifying detail that only the sickest mind could take any pleasure in it. And yet... at times the movie does tend to linger on some scenes a little too long. The movie has a kind of documentary feel about it... like you are actually watching this happen. (The effect is only broken when the actors speak... they don't do dialogue well.) There really isn't much of a plot to this movie. A young city girl goes alone to a cabin in the woods... four men chase after her and rape her... then she kills them all. The acting is all pretty poor... with the exception of the actress who played the girl (Camille Keaton)... in one scene she lets out probably the most blood-curdling scream in movie history... this couldn't have been an easy part to play. There are some very well-directed scenes (a classic horror movie moment-that-makes-you-jump-out-of-your-chair, the heroine in a motorboat waving an ax over her head, the bathtub scene) but ultimately the movie doesn't quite overcome its low budget. The finale in particular is kind of a letdown... some of the guys seem to be let off a little too easy. The often-censored bathtub sequence would have made a much more effective ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i have the uncut version of this on video and have seen it numerous times...the shortcomings of the film are many but i don't think it ever intended on being a 'gone with the wind'..hyperbole aside, there are a few redeeming considerations...first off, some of the acting is decent and gives the impression of being very real...eron tabor (johnny) and camille keaton (jennifer) give credible performances...neither are refined but rather crudely real - as the situation would demandsecondly, camille keaton comes off as being both girlish and hauntingly beautiful...her hair in the bathroom scene is magnificent, speaking from a hairdresser's perspective...finally, the technicals of this movie were certainly passable..the sound and cinematography were as good as most 'b' movies...people want to jump all over this movie, calling it the worst of all time, because the editing and direction, as well as a good deal of the acting and dialog, are garbage...but there are redeeming qualities about this movie that keep it off the bottom of the barrel..i'd give it a 'd' or a 4 on a scale of 1-10 (which is better than i would give the ridiculous and laughable 'beyond the valley of the dolls')</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i rented " i spit on your grave" from netflex. i had herd of it and even seen parts so i thought id give the whole move a shot. i love horror movies,their about all i watch. this movie was very refreshing in that it was totally realalistic. everything that happened in this movie could really and I'm sure has happened to people.i think people hate it because they don't want to think humans can be so savage (either sex) i watched the whole thing cause i thought the young lady did a kick ass job of getting those guys back. i let my boss watch it and he said it was a great movie,even though he crossed his legs at the mention of the bathtub scene.any movie that can make people feel strong emotions from watching it is a good movie in my opinion,good or bad emotions.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" is a terrible movie. I had heard terrible things about it, as have many others. I wanted to see it for those reason. It's just one of those things...you have information leading to the fact that it will be bad, but you have to see just HOW bad. I cannot believe I wasted my time and money on it. "The most controversial film of all time" turned out to be a bunch of bumpkins taking turns raping a girl. She, in return, gets revenge. Revenge has been grounds for a a lot of movies. However, most of those movies to it in a more tasteful and watchable fashion. I felt nothing from this movie except depression, disgust and regret for the better things I could have put my money towards. The shock value of this movie is not enough to watch it. It is pure garbage. In a nutshell, I am an embarrassed owner of one of the worst movies I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There is some good acting in this film. The lead actress Camille Keaton gives a great performance, especially physically. The head bad guy also does a good job. The one thing I didn't like about it was the fact that they had to have a retarded guy. It seems like most gang rape movies have one retarded guy who is not sure he can do it. During the second rape scene, Keaton is incredible. The scene is repulsive, scary, and just makes your skin crawl. This movie is brutal, but the setting and acting make it worth watching. The way she gets revenge on the leader of the group made me wince in pain. 5/10 Average</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As it's a film from the late 70's, and it had a premise similar to LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT I decided to give it a chance. It was a big mistake...A woman travels in order to write a novel. Her trip turns ugly when four demented men rape her and try to kill her. These men (including a retarded moronic) rape her, not once, but four times! This woman survives the attacks and decides to take revenge on these demented men. She accomplishes her revenge as she murders them.It has some very disturbing scenes (of course, can't be compared to LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT) but it works for those who like rape and physical abuse scenes. I don't know but the heroine of this movie is very skinny to beat the killers... Anyways, this movie came out in the pre-slasher era so what we have is trash.Not recommended even for fans of the slasher genre, this is for fans of bad movies overall.1/10 -Burn it!

		<fullReview>The movie is coarse and stark, which marks it as a product of the 70s. It also contains scenes of not just extreme but also disturbing violence, which is OK if you're a film scholar. But don't watch this one if you're simply looking for a thriller; it's not right.The acting is OK, considering the material they had to work with. I watched it mainly to see what Roger Ebert was fussing about so much -- he loathes the movie because it depicts rape as an act of lust (which it is not) instead of an act of violence and domination (which it is). I agree that this IS a loathsome portrayal but I didn't feel as deeply offended. I read once it was based on an actual story but how close the movie followed I don't know.BTW, a woman's clothing is not an invitation to rape her, period.jm (a man)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Notorious and capable of shocking</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hailed as one of the prime instigators (alongside The Driller Killer,Cannibal Holocaust and The Last House on the Left) responsible for the VideoNasties debate in the UK, I Spit on Your Grave is a shocking film, but doesn't deserve the notoriety it baths within. The film also defies the sexist accusations surrounding it. Its alter title; ?Day of the Woman' may be preferable as the male rapists gain no merit from the brutality, they are not presented as ?good men', and the film becomes reminiscent of Death Wish when their rape victim turns to revenge. Sailing across the lake at the end suggests she is the true victor/survivor. Gorehounds maybe a little disappointed as the film works more on its ferocious low budget power to be nasty than prosthetics and graphic gore.SPOILERS AHEAD ... A familiar exploitation plot: Jennifer is brutally gang-raped by four hoodlums when she rents a country house near a lake to complete her first novel. Believing that all New York women are promiscuous, they chose to have some fun with her. The men kidnap her and take her into the woods where each one takes turn to viciously molest her. These are the hard parts of the film to sit through. After each rape they allow her to escape only to catch up and with her and attack once more. The film also contains one of the most memorably painful killings in the history of horror film. There isn't much graphic violence, but the infamous line - `I can't stop the bleeding?' will remain in male spectators' minds long after the end credits roll.At one point there were rumours about a sequel being made. As it stands today, it seems that we might never see ?I Still Spit on Your Grave'. The film was banned outright and remained so until recently. But be warned the recent region2, UK VHS release is cut by the BBFC.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neither good nor enjoyable but important</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't make the mistake of viewing this film in the context of a piece of entertainment. This film exists for one purpose only, to show the act of rape in its most horrifying and disgusting form. All other elements of story only exist to allow the filmmaker to package this film into a form that allows it to be released to audiences.Of course you should be disgusted after viewing this, perhaps you should even switch it off, that's the whole point. For people to complain at the presentation of seemingly ordinary people as the perpertrators of horrendous crime displays the kind of naive worldview that this film exists to challenge. Not every criminal is an instantly recognisable socially maladjusted psycopath as most Hollywood films would lead us to believe. Our neighbours and our relatives perform hideous acts of violence and then carry on with their lives, when and if they are discovered the usual reaction is shock because we assume that 'normal' people wouldn't do such things.This is a brave film, there are no cutaways to let us off the hook, no leaving it to our imagination, we see everything in all its filthy detail and hopefully it turns our stomachs.As for the hype about the revenge scenes, as I've mentioned they are not an important part of this film, they are poorly staged and less than believable, unlike the all too real rape scenes that make up the first half of the film.This film isn't a horror or drama, it isn't an art film, it exists outside of these concepts of genre, however much it pretends not to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sociology or exploitation? You decide . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like everybody else, the first time I watched _I Spit on Your Grave_ (11 years ago) was because of its notoriety, and on that first viewing, I noticed only its most obvious feminist and revenge themes. However, when I watched it for the second time (on DVD), I noticed several themes and meanings I had missed the first time around. Horror films often carry many subtle psychological and sociological messages, and while the ones in _I Spit_ do not make it a classic, I feel they are worth considering when reviewing the film.(SPOILERS AHEAD)Many of these subtle issues deal with the woman, Jennifer, and with her femininity. Jennifer writes cliche-ridden romance stories about submissive women, suggesting that she herself is a model of the traditional woman who is vulnerable to danger and, particularly, to misogyny. We see this when one of the attackers mockingly reads aloud from her manuscript and then tears it up before raping her. However, in accordance with Rudyard Kipling's statement that "The female is the most dangerous of the species," Jennifer's femininity also enables her to lure two of the men to their deaths after she has recovered. So the director is saying that the same feminine qualities that can cause women to be victimized can also cause them to become empowered, which is, after all, a goal of feminism.As for the men, the director shows them as not only overconfident, but also self-deluded and easily manipulated by society. For example, the retarded man, Matthew, only rapes Jennifer when the others goad him on, suggesting that sexism is not natural, but learned from others. Also, Matthew goes along with the other three men because they are his friends and he wants to please them: sexism, the director is saying, is something men display to impress each other. Since Matthew has limited intellectual capabilities, his actions and attitudes are more natural, showing how the other men's are unnatural: for example, he cannot climax when raping Jennifer, but can later in the film, when she pretends that she desires him.Finally, the film shows how everybody has both good and bad in him, and how the two often conflict with each other. Jennifer takes revenge on the four men, of course, but goes into a church and asks forgiveness before doing so, suggesting that she has not become completely bad. Also, she witnesses the ringleader spending time with his wife and children; this scene humanizes this character and shows how sexism, as bad as it is, is a part of society. One last example comes when the man has gone missing: his wife curses the other two men and calls them bums, but then walks over to one of her children and hugs them. Love and hate do coexist.I could go on and on, but you see my point. If I can write a term paper on _I Spit on Your Grave_, it shows that the film is more complex than most people realize. It does have excruciating scenes of rape and murder, but the viewer who can look beyond those things will find many subtle themes and meanings.(END OF SPOILERS)I have to disagree with those who call _I Spit on Your Grave_ an "art film" based on the cinematography. If the cinematography in this movie is different from the typical Hollywood film, it's because this is a low budget independent film. Being different from the mainstream does not an art film make. I would call this an "independent film" or even an "alternative film," but it doesn't fall into the "art film" category. Even though the film is well made, the production values are too low. Plus, I'd have to say that _I Spit_ is more a 70s exploitation film with some redeeming qualities than an art film with some sleazy qualities. The rapes and murders are effectively brutal and unglamorized, and they contribute to the film's sociological meanings, but no one is about to believe that the director didn't have the drive-in crowd in mind.So I'd say that _I Spit on Your Grave_ is both exploitation AND sociological commentary. Of course, this film definitely isn't for everybody, and it may not even be for most people. Many have difficulty focusing on anything in the movie but the violence, but violence is a part of life, and this movie makes that point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ugly, Ugly Movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching "I Spit On Your Grave", I just kind of sat staring at the TV, trying to figure out what I had just seen. On one hand, my brain tells me it WAS a movie, because it clocks in at about an hour and a half. On the other hand, my brain tells me it was just a snuff film. So, for the most part, we have an hour and a half long snuff film. Difference is, this one has a story. More or less.By now, you've probably read about the plot: woman goes to reclusive cabin in the woods, gets "attacked" by 4 guys she meets along the way... Sounds simple enough, but the way it was shown was just excruciating. It would be one thing to show the "attack" happen and begin the next scene with the woman recovering in her house - but instead we're shown four - count 'em, FOUR - "attack" scenes, which get progressively more and more disturbing. After each one, it shows her stumbling, then crawling through the wilderness, muddier and even more bruised and battered after each encounter with the country boys. The hardest part of this movie to watch are the scenes where there is almost no sound, just the image of the main character trudging through the forest with a vacant expression on her face, covered in mud and cuts. These parts actually go on upwards of 2 to 4 minutes at a time.The thing is, even though our male villains are amoral for the most part, the one I did feel sympathy for was Matthew, the "mentally challenged" of the group. The only reason he did anything wrong in the first place was because the other 3 teased, harassed, and bullied him into it. *POTENTIAL SPOILER* For example, when Camille Keaton's character has fully recovered, she calls the grocery store in which Matthew does deliveries. He comes to her cabin, where she seduces - and subsequently kills him. This is the scene in which a more conflicted side of Matthew is shown. He says "I don't have any friends except for those guys! Sure, I could've been YOUR friend... But you're only here for the summer! What am I supposed to do the rest of the year?" This was the instance in which it made me actually feel sorry for one of the guys who got dispatched. Other than that, the other three got exactly what came to them, especially the ringleader during the bathtub scene (which actually made me feel nauseous). *SPOILER OVER*"I Spit On Your Grave" is exactly what people say it is - an ugly, dirty exploitation film. Of course, maybe the director had that in mind. Regardless, I did not enjoy watching it too much, and it's hard to explain to guests exactly WHY it's part of my DVD collection. To be honest, I really don't know. Perhaps because I heard it's a cult classic - and I'm always up for those. This time though, it was different. It didn't make me laugh or say "This is an awful movie." In fact, this is one of the only movies EVER that has managed to not get a clear reaction from me... simply because I didn't know what to make of it. Watch if you must, but watch responsibly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to admit I came across 'I Spit on your Grave' by accident in the video store. I still cannot tell whether I regret buying it or not. The basis of the film has been well documented through the years but I find the context a little hard to believe. It is almost as if the director was desperate to make a nasty little film about rape and retribution and thought 'I know. Lets have these 4 yokels who are bored attack a woman for no reason except to get some cheap thrills and aid some perverted person to lose his virginity'. What follows is pretty horrible. The acting is as close to awful as you can get with the most realism achieved in the sickest parts of the film. The film can be seen to be feminist in its conclusion and the tagline of 'no jury would ever convict her' could spark a debate on the seriousness of rape as opposed to murder, or as it could be argued man-slaughter. The film left me with a nasty taste in my mouth having been horrified by the rape scene and the acts of retribution that followed. Also strange were her actions after the rape scene which make very little sense at all. This being her progression from New York author having been raped to cold, calculating murderer. But in my eyes the whole experience of watching this film made little sense anyway. A video nasty if ever I saw one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After viewing this film in the early 80's, I agreed 150% with the Siskel and Ebert review of it, which was that it was the poorest excuse for a film ever made. In retrospect, I have to think that it may have been the most subversive. This film shows a brutal, horribly protracted rape. Everything else is secondary: the setting, the perpetrators, the revenge...everything. The rape scene is the only realistic thing about this film. And that's just the point. This is a film made for people who view rape as an abstract concept. After seeing it, you will never do so again. If you feel like you need to take a shower after watching it, it's because you were paying attention.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was just kicking around in this site, and I decided to click on this movie just for laughs, and I was surprised how many people felt the same way about this movie as I did. I saw this movie one time, on video back in 1981, or '82, I can't remember exactly. A buddy of mine said "Hey man, you have to see this one!" So I saw it, and I was shocked! I found nothing erotic about this movie, in fact I really had to force myself to watch it to the end.Some people said of this movie that it was nothing but a soft-core porn flick. Others said that it was a low-budget revenge movie. Some said why would anyone make a movie like this? I really don't know why the movie was made, but I would like to take a guess. At the time when the movie was made, adult movies were on the big screen, and there was a mind-set back then if a woman got raped, she brought it on to herself, because her jeans were too tight, and she was 'struttin'-her-stuff'. So it's reasonable to assume that the film was made to show (in detail) that rape is not erotic, rape hurts!Honestly, I have never seen the movie since, and I don't plan to see it again. If you think about it, the concept was used in 'Death Wish' when Charles Bronson's daughter was raped (in detail, no less), and his wife killed.Critics, and most movie goers hated this one, and I can't say I liked it either. BUT, I respect it. It makes a good point. Though the acting, and the script was terrible, I felt sorry for the woman, and when she got her revenge, I did feel the got what they deserved, and I'm not a violent person. So it did make quite an impression on me that stays with me after twenty years. </fullReview>

So guys, don't say you don't like this film just to impress the ladies. I'm a guy and I think it's great. Nothing wrong with a little revenge now and then. Think of it as Death Wish meets Accused.

		<shortDescription>Enough With The Unjust Criticism!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wrote a review a while back, but Roger Ebert's review of "Enough" ... in which he brings up this film (which he despised) made me want to write a bit more. I don't think it is but *SPOILER ALERT*[possible spoiler below, ok?]a spoiler to say so, but "Enough" is a revenge flick, but to some is much more acceptable than "I Spit On Your Grave" because a major actress (Jennifer Lopez), director (Michael Apted) and screenwriter (look it up, but he did other mainstream stuff) are involved. And the violence is not as explicit. I commend Ebert for comparing the two movies, though his review of "Enough" is not as disgusted as his "I Spit" review. Thus, even Ebert feels "I Spit" is uniquely worthy of our disgust.Others explain below (and I can supply a url of an extended discussion of mine, but apparently urls are against imdb policy; so email me if you care), the disgust is not warranted. I still hold my belief that this film is quite worthy of viewing. Any number of movies use our hatred of criminals, drugs, or foreigners to in disgusting fashion glorify violence for our action enjoyment. But horrible simply horrible for when a woman who was gang raped does this ... and in no way is happy about it. And the film, distractors aside, has scenes that in dramatic fashion does more than quite a few films to show her thinking and how this effects her very soul [look at that final shot again ... compare it to a shot of her in the cabin in the beginning of the movie]And even the guys have some background [some cuts don't have a key diner scene, that is well worth seeing]. The leader is a family man ... doesn't make him less evil. The retarded guy is nice, but falls under the spell of "friends," and that is what counts after he takes part in the rape. The other two are run of the mill losers, that society has tons of, and doesn't warrant much comment in this film. The discussion while they fish is an interesting look into the mindset of these rapists. The scene at the gas station is well done as well ... esp given the leader's commentary on it later in the film. The film puts a lot into its non-rape/revenge scenes, and does it better than many would give it credit for.yes, it's in part exploitation ... but honestly, the average person enjoys trash or at least less than high brow stuff. Nonetheless, such material often expresses important themes we all care about. It is part of the reason we watch -- watching VIP or Baywatch is nice on the eyes, but it is not just eye candy. That would get boring -- it's what is mixed in with the eye candy (or exploitation) that counts. And if people come to see ISPOYG for violence and nudity and in the process it makes them think (many watch the film and end up w an uncomfortable feeling, unlike the run of the mill slasher flick... why? this film is not the run of the mill slasher flick, which often treats women lousy and includes disgusting violence but w/o the point of this film)Finally, I did not see "Enough," but from what I hear, this film is better in way of characters and plot. This film is logical and (at least for a movie) believable ... woman goes into the woods and is raped. This leads to and explains/justifies (?) woman getting revenge. Guys too dumb to realize they are in danger or no match to a smart woman who actually thinks things through. All the violence is disgusting,and none is really glorified. Finally, unlike "Enough," the heroine isn't seen as so pure that she can't do something truly inhumane. And no easy way out is provided ... including papering over the horror of it all.-J</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** ***SPOILERS*** I love my mom. She's a fan of horror and kungfu movies and whatever movie I brought home she generally enjoyed. It's been over close to 20 years since we saw this and we still occasionally watch kungfu movies together. What a mom! BTW, she loved this movie.Basically, a woman is brutally raped, twice, by I think escaped convicts. Then, pretending to like it, she goes to each man (4 in all if i remember right) and kills them in horrid ways. The End.Of course my mom's favorite parts were the revenge factors. Honestly the film was disturbing then, and personally after working with rape survivors for 10 years I find it appalling. The film is brutal and straight forward in its depiction of rape, which due to the film's amateurish quality, looks shockingly real. I'm not gonna say it's without any entertainment value at all, since my mom liked it for when she gets revenge, but I wouldn't recommend it at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't believe the hype...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Living in the UK this film has always been classed as a 'video nasty' and the only way for me to see this was to 'obtain' a bootleg version of it to see it completely uncut. I wasn't tempted to buy the UK R2 DVD that has just been passed as an 18 cert by the bbfc, with might I add still has 7 mins cut! Still, viewing the cut 7 minutes doesn't make this film better in any possible way. I've only been bothered to watch this film once and that was with a friend which made is slightly uncomfortable to sit through and watch nearly 40 mins of watching a woman getting raped and beaten. But it's expected anyway if you're gonna watch this film. Still, this load of trash has only ever been made famous because of it's 'video nasty status', which is just a poor plot for a film anyway. The acting was completely awful, and there was really no atmosphere or any attempt to make one. Except maybe besides the 'penis chop' scene when the guy is bleeding to death in the bath and she's sitting in the other room rocking back and forth listening to classical music. But that's all I can think of. At a push thats probably the only good scene in the film. Don't believe the hype...this isn't an amazing film as it's sometimes perceived. If you're looking for a true good horror video nasty then go watch something like 'The Beyond' by Lucio Fulci.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is absoluteley AWFUL. The acting is trite. The directing is so amateur that it makes Sesame St. look like a Hollywood Oscar winner!! The editing? don't even go there! All in all, this film is soo bad that it's painful to watch. But it should be painful to watch because of the events that take place.....and out of them all, only one will stick in my mind for ever!!!!!!Jennifer goes to a secluded house in the country and she gets raped on FOUR seperate occasions culminating in, what could have been, a disturbing sequence of events. Alas, this is not the case. The rape scene, to me, is mild. We don't really get to see much, and the editing and camera work in the initial rape is awful, and is unwatchable. But the scene SHOULD be unwatchable because of what is happening, not because the film is awful!!If you want to make your audience's think, or be disturbed, then you should find a way to choreograph the scene (both acting and camera work) so it can achieve the desired reaction it deserves. The rape scenes in "A Clockwork Orange" and "Deliverance" are the most shocking I have ever seen, and this scene comes nowhere near as close as what they achieve.The men are all stereotypical, and basically we WANT them to die. At least the director made us hate them, which is the desired effect!The one scene which will forever live in my male memory is the castration scene. Now this IS effective. Why? basically, cos we don't see anything. All we see is the knife going into the bath and Jennifer biding her time as she slowly massages the man's genitals. I was screaming at the screen here, I couldn't wait another second, the tension was unbearable for me, and when the action is done......!!!!!!!!!!!! AAAAAAAAAAAGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!! And the BLOOD!!! OH MY GOD THE BLOOD!!!! What a way to die!! I wouldn't wish that on any of my enemies!!!!! Anyway, you need to see the film if only for this part alone, this is why I ultimately gave the film a 4/10It's up to you if you Enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Shocking, But Not Really Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this may be good for pure shock value, it really was not a very well-made film. The characterization and acting were both very poor and took away from the film's atmosphere. The rape sequence was grueling and relentlessly cruel, which is not necessarily a bad thing considering that seemed to be what the director was going for.Also, there's something fairly important about the plot that is never explained: after Matthew spared her life, why didn't Jennifer call the police and have the men arrested? That was obviously her original plan, as she went straight for the phone when she first arrived back at the cabin. What changed her mind?"I Spit on Your Grave" is worth watching if you want to be shocked or revolted, and also just so you can tell people you've seen it. If you're in the market for a truly disturbing or psychologically bothersome film, however, you won't find it here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Successful on a Exploitative level</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Notorious film which with it's rampant nudity, sado-masochistic sex, and gory violence brought new meaning to the term European sleeze. Has a beautiful young women (Keaton) gang raped by a bunch of brutes only to later turn the tables and kill them one by one. Keaton is gorgeous (especially naked) and she is probably the films only real virtue. Although fans of sleeze who like their exploitation uncompromised will not be disappointed. (Especially with the full length, unrated version.) Universally condemned by the critics, it is important to note that the filmmakers do take the time to show the victims emotional devastation. Also, although the argument has merits, it's hard to say it victimizes females when it's the males who become the final victims. Let's face it this was conceived as nothing more than a exploitation film and on that level it does quite well. Besides when one is in the mood for a 'bad' underground movie they really aren't looking for socially redeeming qualities. One of the few films in history to have no music whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw the uncut X-rated version (originally titled Day of the Woman) of I Spit on Your Grave. Shortly thereafter, I watched it again to make sure that my eyes and mind weren't deceiving me. They weren't. I'm in no hurry to watch it again.Everything you've heard is true. This is one of the most extreme, repulsive movies you'll find anywhere. It goes further than Last House on the Left, The House by the Lake, etc. Four brutal rapes are carried out over a forty-minute sequence, and the camera never cuts away. There is no emergency safety release to give you a break from the brutality (as with Last House's inept cops), and all you can do is watch as the tortured woman cries and suffers for what seems like forever. Then she picks herself up and seeks an equally sadistic revenge, complete with a blood-gushing bathtub scene that'll make your teeth grind.Whether or not this film is socially important, I can't say. While I can see what may be feminist elements, I can also see why many simply deem it a soft-porn domination roughie. It's impossible to enjoy, really, but it DOES get under your skin. I guess that was the point. It's incredibly well-made and has top-notch performances--very professional all around, without a single subplot or trace of humor to lighten the proceedings. But it's a horror movie, and it certainly IS horrifying. See it if you like, but be forewarned, because you may not want to be traumatized in such a manner. Even the most desperately curious may want to keep their distance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grindhouse movie, plain and simple. . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is from the "golden age" of the Times Square grindhouse flick, movies that came out in the mid to late 70s (just before the advent of VCRs) and played to specific theatres, usually with extremely long runs. Other movies like this were "Bloodsucking Freaks" and "Snuff". The recurring themes in these films were bloody violence and misogynism, with little to redeem them socially. Always over the edge and almost pornographically violent, these movies spread by word of mouth and only with VCRs could most of middle America (and the world..) see them. The movie concerns a woman off in a quiet town, where she is raped, repeatedly, and the film is careful to linger long on scenes of incredible violence. The rest of the movie is caught up in the woman's revenge. Typically misogynistic, even a scene of a castrating woman is included. This movie was never meant to be seen in the comfort of home, where we can sit back and sneer. It was made to be a public spectacle, it was made to make you feel as filthy as the theatres who showed these films were. It was made for you to tell your friends what a "sick" movie you saw last Friday night and then take your friends to see it the following Friday. It speaks to many levels of male fear of women and sexuality and perhaps, when we get behind the gasps of shock, this is why this movie is still avidly watched today. Recommended only if trying to recreate the on-screen ambiance of 1978 Times Square Sleaze-pits.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad good movie or a good bad movie?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I still haven´t decided, if I shall like "I spit on your grave" or not, because the good points and the bad points balance each other: the plot itself is very empty, the film exists mainly of an exceptional long rape sequence, followed by a loud and psychological implausible act of vengeance. But I think this is not the principal request writer and director Meir Zarchi wanted to tell, more important is the semi-documentary character of his film and the resulting question in how far the behavior of Jennifer Hill is really justified..? Is self-justice really the right solution and in how far she had provoked the calamity by herself (by swimming naked in the lake or wearing provocative clothes, what caused misunderstandings at the rural population about those "horny" urban people)? On the other side: what should you, if you certainly wouldn´t reach any success with the national justice? An explosive theme! Many people complain that this movie runs totally without any score: it´s quite strange at the beginning, but you will get used to this fact and besides it conveys this film a more authentic feeling. Camille Keaton is giving a tour de force by being raped, tortured, beaten and abused; her way of suffering is absolutely touching and pitiful. Nobody will be left cold about her agony! In view of this fact the alternative title "Day of the Woman" is much more matching than the original one "I spit on your grave", what sounds quite like sensationalism. Otherwise this title is suited, because this film only offers surface showmanship at the end, instead of a plausible solution. The watcher stays left alone with all the open questions... If you want to see better movies about the same theme I recommend to watch Jodie Foster´s Oscar awarded rape drama, Wes Craven´s "Last House on the Left" or even Troma´s comedy flick "Mother´s Day"...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just like "Lipstick", this movie centers around a woman raped and gets revenge. Only in this film, it seems like the attackers really deserved it! Except for a bikini, the lead female did virtually nothing to entice her attackers. She was merely chosen at random to be the one to "deflower" a mental feeb virgin and it got out of control to the point were their perverse desire to see a retard have sex turned to anger against their victim. Its not clear exactly why she turned to revenge, instead of going to the law, as in "Lipstick", but the way she convinced her attackers that she really enjoyed it, was a delicious turn of events that sets this film apart.I think this is an excellent example of how gang rape usually doesn't start out as such, but how a "feeding frenzy" develops and it just turns into one.Camille Keaton does a very good job of going through this film much of the time naked, with little dialogue and still turning in a credible performance.Do like I did and edit out the slow parts and watch it again, and this film is really quite good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Powerful Unjustly Maligned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well. I saw this film five to ten years ago and it still sticks in my mind; this apparently is not surprising given how many people felt compelled to comment on it. The film is no classic (though in a way it is), but I feel it is in its own way a powerful film and unjustly maligned. I do not claim that it was made with the best of motives, it surely was at least partly motivated by exploitation value, but it is not crud in any regard. If it was a worthless horribly made film, I doubt if it would be so infamous. There surely is a large amount of cruddy films out there, films probably much worse than this one.Various criticisms of the film supplied here seem misguided. The lack of music (there is a bit actually) and low production values actually make the film more powerful in a way, as a few said the almost documentary feel gives it strength. The acting is not uniquely bad; actually for the story it tells, it is pretty decent -- we are dealing with morons here after all and a victim that is more a plot force than a unique character. The rape/revenge storyline is hard to take but (1) that's better than other revenge flicks that are easy to take, thus glorifying or cheapening (if not justifying) violence (2) the basic simplicity actually leads us to know a bit about these characters instead of other films that are just excuses to see people get killed. I agree with another writer who notes that the horrifying acts forces the viewer to see the horror involved, unlike more unreal acts in other films.The film also has various other merits. (1) Not only do we see the harm suffered by this woman (not saying it is portrayed that well, the film is not some great piece of art or anything), but she gets her own revenge. Death Wish type movies often have harm come to basically faceless people and some Bronson type emotionlessly gets revenge. Furthermore, how she does it may not be believable, but it is surely the fantasy of many rape victims to make their rapists pay; also a few women are willing to demean themselves to some degree to get such revenge (if only in their fantasies). We even see the woman go to church to ask for forgiveness -- like she knows she is doing something wrong, but does so anyway. (2) As a few said, we get a view of her attackers, their social situation, their powerlessness (they do not even have the guts to kill her, sending a retarded man, who turns out to be more appealing then them in the end, to do it) and even the wife and kids of one of them -- certain depth there (3) The raw force of the whole movie leaves a mark -- this is in part exploitation plain and simple, but also is an accomplishment worth noting. We are forced to see the pain of rape (in a few cases it is as drawn out like this, and the victim is killed), we are forced to see the pain of the victim and her loss of some of herself that allows her to get revenge, and we are forced to see how she basically demeans herself to their level to get it. The simplicity of the movie only adds force to it, leaves a mark. (4) The basic city vs country, rich vs poor, 'flirt' that might just know she is flirting (or so goes the male argument) vs rube dichotomy (big word for reviewing trash :)) was pretty interesting. Again the film actually did have themes, not just excuses for mindless violence.The movie is not a great piece of art, but is on its own level, a decent work of low budget film making (one gets the idea that the budget was so low that fifth guy talked about in the adds were left out of the film). Other movies are as tasteless and vulgar, more so even for the fact they trivialize the actions in the movies in ways this movie does not. I saw Last House On The Left, which Roger Ebert and others, see as some great work of film making, while this is trash. I wasn't that impressed by that film, while 'I Spit On Your Grave' still sticks in my head and not just for its exploitation elements. The producers may not be famous for anything else, but that is kind of sad, since I think like people like Katt Shea, they probably could have made some other stuff worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fascinating Depiction of Human Brutality</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is very odd---despite its being extremely violent and repulsive at times, it's mesmerizing in its simple, direct style which for the purposes of the movie is very effective. The strange, distanced style it was created in creates an almost "you are there" quality which made viewing it quite disturbing; for example , the lack of musical cues which in conventional horror films signals when to get "scared" actually makes this film more frightening. It bears to mind that violence in the real world is often mixed with the mundane and the ordinary and in the real world, we don't get scary music to warn us when something awful will happen. It brings up very interesting notions of spectatorship and identification; the viewer is not, as in a conventional horror or thriller film, asked to closely identify with either the victim or her tormentors. In this sense, it's a much more honest film than Wes Craven's moralistic tract "Last House on the Left" which spends much of its time leading its viewer on what to think and how to judge the events. "I Spit..." leaves a disconcerting "openness" to these questions of moral judgement which is ultimately more thought- and discussion-provoking than your typical slasher-film experience. In this sense, it's a lot closer to real life violence---often senseless, brutal and leaves the participants with no comforting moral platitudes after the fact.An interesting film experience, but not one I'd like to revisit too often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Misogynist, or just plain misunderstood?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Is this a serious anti-rape movie or a sickening piece of misogynist sleaze? 'I Spit On Your Grave' must rank as one of the most controversial, and hotly debated films of all time. However, with the clarifying perception afforded by the past elapsed 15 years since the video nasties furore kicked off, and in the context of the sort of films we've been seeing released this year ('In The Company Of Men' and 'Funny Games' spring to mind), the case seems far less cut and dry now than it did then. That this film could be taken as pro-rape is quite ridiculous. The male characters are just too unappealing for their audience counterparts to identify with. Likewise, the documentary style of the film, comprising almost exclusively of long shots unraveling in real time with a minimum of edits and no incidental music leads the viewer into a more objective interpretation of what unfolds on the screen. Of course, it could be argued that this is due to lack of budget or lack of technical expertise, but I've seen enough low-budget films of this period to believe this not to be true. 'I Spit On Your Grave' is actually quite cleverly made. In the early scenes we are made to identify more with Camille Keaton (in probably one of the least flattering roles in movie history). That said, the rape and revenge scenario is a fairly standard dramatic staple and the 'anti-rape' message rather platitudinous. Whilst it hardly panders to sicko sensation seekers as accused, the film itself could be accused of being gratuitous. Like 'In The Company Of Men' this detached portrayal of humanity at its basest and most evil is disturbing because of its lack of cinematic devices and sympathetic characters, and not just due to the explicitly graphic violence of the rape. The final sensation is more of confusion than anything else, as we are clearly not being forced to think in a certain way (cf the Hollywood didactic treatment of 'The Accused'). As a coda, I'd like to mention that as opposed to Roger Ebert's experience of watching this surrounded by screaming hoodlums, my fellow audience members at the ICA sat in stunned silence throughout, only emitting a sympathetic groan during the castration scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes, the production values are low and it's graphic, graphic, GRAPHIC, but in many ways "I Spit on Your Grave" is incredibly effective. As a whole, it's an awful idea: woman raped in every possible way takes mildly ironic vengeance. The concept is emotionally immature and demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of the experience of rape. But on a smaller scale, the movie definitely has its moments.A lot of people have mentioned the impromptu lop-it-offa-me in the tub, which contrasts a sleepy, sexy atmosphere quite disturbingly with the violent events taking place. This scene is good (it had me squirming), but the most effective anti-dramatic scene has to be the rape itself. I haven't seen a lot of rape in movies, but this is the only remotely realistic depiction I have seen. Again, on the story level it doesn't hold together: after rape #1 they anticipate her route and set up a little ho-down, go to her house to wait for her, etc. But the actual depiction was, if anything, TOO real. There was absolutely no chance of a viewer mistaking rape for sex in this movie: it was violence, it was power, it was kids torturing cats because they can, but no way was it sex. I can't imagine anyone identifying with the rapists in these scenes. It was grueling and painful to watch it go on for forty minutes (I don't think anyone was snacking for the first half of this movie), but that's probably the only way rape should be depicted. The three main rapists were also well done throughout the movie, representing the kind of dumb, chuckling evil we see all the time in real life.So yes, overall it's no classic, but "I Spit on Your Grave" has some downright artful scenes, and I wouldn't be surprised to see this movie survive for a long time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hmmm, what can you possibly say about this most infamous of exploitation flicks? I find rape scenes in movies disturbing, so the half hour take-it-in-turns rape sequence inflicted on Camille Keaton's character was a pretty gruelling experience.This film IS graphic, exploitative, unpleasant and cheaply made, but that's all pretty well known. What it isn't is just as interesting, if not quite as headline grabbing. The rape scene may be hard to watch. but at least the film cannot possibly be accused of eroticizing, trivializing or glamourizing rape, something many mainstream movies are guilty of. I've also read that the woman's whole character is pretty 2D - she gets raped, exacts her revenge, the film ends. This is true, but at last it's not one of those cookie cutter revenge movies where the leading guy's girlfriend/wife/sister/mother is raped, giving him a vested proprietary interest in avenging his wronged one, kicking bad guy ass and providing us with mental floss and a good reason to eat popcorn in the dark. At least this film depressed the hell out of me.Definitely one to avoid if you don't like strong stuff - but we all knew that already. The one good thing you can say about this film is that it wears its exploitation on its sleeve, rather than slipping it into your overpriced, mega-sized cinema soda while you're not looking.Finally, a big hand to Ed King's Horrortron, which finally gave some people in Dublin the chance to see the film and judge it for themselves.PS The castration scene rules!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You know, I started thinking about this movie against my better judgment and I wondered how a movie like this ever got made. I wondered how the director Mier Zarchi (let's mention all the names, no one gets away from this mess) pushed this story.How do you convince a crew of people: "Okay, we're going to make a movie about a woman who gets raped and beaten five or six times, then cuts the men up one by one". How do you tell your lead actress Camille Keaton that the scene requires her to walk through the woods naked and then get sodomized by three men? What does anyone hope to gain from a project like this? I'm not a prude but I do have my limits on what I will tolerate on screen and this isn't it. This is a movie that supposedly gets revenge on rapists but all it does is show the depths of what some people are willing to put on screen. Think of the thousands of ideas and stories that can be told and ponder why on earth someone settled on this.I choose "I Spit On Your Grave" as the worst movie that I have ever seen and I guess the director would deem this as a compliment, but in my estimation he should be ashamed of himself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pales in comparison to the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to say, right up front, that I watched the 2010 remake before I viewed the original. I'm just saying. I don't think this colored my reaction to this movie. I could, however, see how the remake took the original and made it so much better. The rape scenes were realistic and hard to watch. I could feel the woman's stark fear as the men terrorized her. The lead female in this was the best at acting in this movie. The men weren't so great. Still, the story was moving along. What I couldn't get past was the fact that, after being beaten, raped and tortured by four men, she stays at the house. Not only does she not get the hell outta Dodge, she walk around outside, walks in the woods and sits by the river...even though the rapists might return. How could she stay there? The second thing that gave me trouble was that she used sexuality to lure the men into the death set ups. Especially bothersome....she actually has sex with Matthew. She's been horribly raped 2 weeks earlier..and she's using sex to get at the men. I realize some would say that she's using the very thing that they forced on her to exact revenge, but I just couldn't accept it. The killings were okay, but not all that spectacular. I just wasn't satisfied at the end of this film. I would say..if you want to see this movie...go with the remake. Or...like I did...watch both and make your own comparisons.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A young woman (Camille Keaton) is spotted by a group of men while writing near a river. Not much later, things go from tranquil to nightmarish for her... where do you go after you reach the lowest possible point in your life? The director's commentary with Mier Zarchi begins by revisiting the history and controversy over the film -- is it a story that is sick and makes woman out to be nothing more than a sexual object, or is it a feminist film where the "day of the woman" allows the victim to strike back? Zarchi finally reveals the film's inspiration: in the early 1970s, he and his friend Alex Pfau (a protégé of Roman Polanski) witnessed a rape victim after the fact, her body naked, bloody and broken. They brought the young woman to the police, but allegedly the officer on duty was not very concerned. At this point the director realized that being questioned by the police is not the solution to the rape -- at least not yet -- but the continuation of it.The film is certainly the most explicit up to the time it was made, and some might even say up until today. Those who do not know what to expect may be very shocked by this film if they see it uncut. Then again, even cut, it is a shocking film -- what would be a two minute scene in some films goes on over an hour here.Mike Mayo praises the film to a point, but considers it "crude and single-minded" and suggests viewers check out Abel Ferrara's "Ms. 45". Indeed, the film has a pretty thin plot, but its point is clear, and even the attackers get fleshed out a bit in the second half.What should we make of the church scene? Can you reconcile Christian beliefs with murder or revenge? That is not a question I choose to answer, but certainly a question raised by this film, whether intentionally or otherwise.The film is a natural step from "Last House on the Left", actually upping the ante. And Camille Keaton has to be honored for such dark subject matter and tackling it head-on. This could have been a career killer, and perhaps it was, though it has sealed her place in cult film history.There is also a 29-minute special feature called "The Values of Vengeance" which is insightful, though does not cover much the commentary does not. Of course, if you want to actually see Meir Zarchi's face, here is your chance. And you will hear a nice story about Wizard Video's shrewd business dealings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think the original movie is a good one to have. Even I think Sissy Spacek could make a great Jennifer Hill and not Camile Keaton because Spacek is more of a famous woman actor. Spacek can be great for more horror movies like her famous Brian DePalma movie Carrie. It would be terrific if the original was re-release back into theatres and shown throughout worldwide for this movie to make a bigger profit. Why not have the original edited into an R-rated to play throughout the world. Many more nations would love to watch the R-rated version I Spit On Your Grave. I think the director should have this edited R-rated movie shown in all of the world except Africa.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too flawed to take seriously</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This straightforward rape/retribution movie, more notoriously known as I Spit On Your Grave, tends to polarise opinion. Personally, I take a middle view.The rape scenes are unpleasant and disturbing - that is in their favour. Conversely, they are dwelt upon with what sometimes seems to be unnecessary enthusiasm. Yes, she is brutalised - but then she is brutalised and brutalised and brutalised. Then the revenge sequences show the same approach - distressingly (though understandably) savage, they are again displayed with what appears to be glee. In both cases - the rape and the revenge - the points could have been made more quickly and with less gloating enthusiasm over the detail.While production is satisfactory - the film doesn't look cheap - the acting, with the exception of Camille Keaton's victim, is dreadful. Apart from a willingness to display their privates, the male cast members are uniformly bad. They give the impression that the casting director approached the local amateur dramatic society, and couldn't get anyone from them so had to drop the standard required.In short, with the single exception of Miss Keaton, this film is not very good and leaves a nasty taste in the mouth.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not much to redeem it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty, thirty years ago, along with the rising popularity of video recorders came the attendant controversy - spearheaded by the hysterically reactionary Daily Mail - over the explicit content of some of the movies available to rent. I Spit on Your Grave was selected as one of the movies to face the wrath of our moral guardians, and earned itself a ban as a result. As a result of all this publicity, the movie earned a fame (or infamy) and reputation of which it was completely undeserving. A few weeks ago, I caught it on The Horror Channel in the UK.Obviously, this being an unencrypted TV station, the film was heavily cut. In fact, no sex scenes were shown at all which, ironically, means the film has had a savage act of mutilation performed upon it which is identical to the one we see carried out on one of the characters as he enjoys a soak in the tub. I almost didn't bother commenting on it, but felt that, as I can't see myself ever shelling out the money necessary to see the uncensored version, for the aid of my own memory at least, I should put a few words down.The story is as simple as it is well-known: a young female writer (Camille Keaton) who has rented a cabin in the woods in which she intends to write her new novel, is violently gang-raped by four local men and left for dead. Once recovered, she exacts a violent and bloody revenge? Oddly enough, it was the censored moments of the film that were probably the most impressive. The rape scenes last perhaps a total of seven or eight minutes, and instead of seeing anything explicit, the film is slowed down as the four men close in on their victim and the sounds of her screams and the men's grunts is played on the soundtrack. It's certainly not as stomach churning as the graphic scenes of the unexpurgated film must be, but it is still strong enough to make plausible the extremes to which the victim goes to take her revenge.Other than that, the film doesn't really have that much going for it. It's badly directed and edited by Meir Zarchi. He doesn't seem to have a clue about when he should be closing in on a scene, moving out or panning away. The acting is what you'd expect for a low-budget exploitation flick, and the writing is perhaps a notch above similar movies. It could be argued that the film is undeserving of its' misogynist tag simply because the rapists each receive the punishment any victim would believe they deserve but, not having seen the uncut version I don't really want to get into that.Curiosity is really the only reason any normal person would want to see this film - and once your curiosity is satisfied you'll probably feel it wasn't worth the effort?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sure the basic plot of the film, gave away the whole film. From standpoint of twists , it was expected. Did not get the title either, but thats small potatoes. This film , even though horror, truly had a more progressive art house feel to it. I might be in the minority, but I thought this film was ahead of the times , and not for the reasons that critics wanted this banned. I thought this was an intelligent film, based on an abused woman wanting revenge. The film was a social statement and explored our characters very well. The most minor details were covered in this film and Camille Keaton was uncovered for a lot of this film as well. The actors were wonderful, particularly Richard Pace , who played Matthew, a mentally slow delivery boy. Through the magic of this IMDb website , I checked the filmographies for many of the actors in this film . To my chagrin... This film was the extent of most of these actors. I can only imagine they were blacklisted. This film was probably more thriller, similar to 'Deliverance' and less horror and not violently graphic. I would suggest anyone to view this film. Whatever one thinks of this film, one thing is for sure; The writers,directors and actors gave their heart to this film. You can not ask for more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three Cheers to I Spit on Your Grave! This movie proves that Hollywood has become conscious of it's viewer's tastes and is finally taking steps to please it's vast audience! I Spit on Your Grave! is a rape flick with a heart of gold. Meir Zarchi's grade 7 friends and Camille Keaton have done a great job. Overall...a fabulous movie! A must watch! Take a Bow Zarchis...you've done a terrific job! General feeling, when I walked out of theatre, among crowd was that it is one time watch-able. It may appeal to strictly adults, who like watching likes of science fiction serials on TV and certainly has much hype to draw crowd initially. An instant classic that we'll be talking about for years to come. Congrats to all involved! OVERALL, a good, and very different type of entertainment altogether. The film is UNIQUE! It's not that GREAT! But could have been a lot better, had the climax been done with perfection. That's where the film is unimpressive! Also, the basket ball match is boring. I didn't like it that much.But then again, nothing is, and nobody's perfect in this world. And that's how, we should take KMG in the end... expecting it to be a good quality entertainment and not larger than life thing! I'm satisfiedhere! Rating : 8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is certainly a misunderstood film. It got all the violence and sex for the hungry gorehounds, but this is certainly not an exploitation flick for 42nd street crowd. It certainly tells a simple story: An attempted beautiful writer (Camille Keaton) goes to a house by the river and is gang raped very violently by four men. She want to revenge and believe me, she got it. That's it. I can't denied that this is a perfect topic for an exploitation flick, but can't say it is because of Meir Zarchi's direction. He treats the issue as a real problem of life. He understand the pain of it's heroine. This movie HATES men, but not even in a feminist way. The violence is sincere, the images are not exploitative. Where a pubic female hair in a Grindhouse flick tries to be exploited and trying to be erotic without understanding here it is alone in it's pity; we don't want to see her suffering anymore and her revenge cannot be overlooked. She got it's reasons and we, finally, understand her. There are problems, of course and it could be a better film. But certainly this is not a bad one.

		<shortDescription>What's the big deal? It's not like it includes a 30 minute rape scene</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK, fine! I Spit On Your Grave does include, by far, the longest rape scene in cinema history, and it is more disturbing than it has any right to be, but this is actually some pretty good horror. I Spit On Your Grave, being mostly about a woman's revenge, is raw, mean-spirited, I call it real horror. Not much of a budget, mostly shot out doors, there's not even any music in this one, just pure horror, and nothing else. Jennifer Hill, a new york, feminist writer, is traveling to the Connecticut country for some peace and quiet, and hopefully some inspiration. Jennifer is starting her first novel, and with the right inspiration, it should be a good one. things seem really peaceful, here in the country, but all that's about to change. Poor Matthew is still a virgin, and that doesn't seem to be changing any time soon, so, some local hicks, who are pretending to be his friend have basically offered him the new woman in town as his first. You've got to wonder how far these guys would go for Matthew if they really considered him a friend. Anyway, the foursome find Jennifer, and basically makes the next 30 minutes of her life a living hell. To say they get carried away would be an understatement. Unfortunately, after they're done with her, the hell remains. Now beaten to a bloody pulp, and driven half-insane, Jennifer realizes that getting even just won't do, she's got to get ahead.Not bad at all, especially if you're not a huge fan of dialog. I especially recommend the Millennium Edition DVD, from Elite Entertainment, with audio commentary by Joe Bob Briggs. Our pal, Joe Bob always provides plenty of dialogue. I would say that the most extreme thing about this one is it's reputation. Like I said, its quality horror, but it's no gore-fest, and things (mostly) don't get all that graphic, compared to what else is out there. But, for those who can't get enough of the underground horror, check it out at least once. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>good little revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Yes, this is the film Siskel and Ebert bashed, battered, and buried. Of course, once that happened, everyone wanted to see it. Here's the gist of the story. Jennifer, a young, attractive writer, arrives at a nice cabin in the woods to get away from the craziness of the big city. Soon after, she is raped and beaten, not once, but twice, from a small gang of bored country folk looking for a good time. The group is led by Johnny who the others are clearly intimidated by. Among the twisted group is Matthew, a retarded child-like man, who will do anything Johnny says so he can feel like one of the gang. In predictable fashion, Jennifer takes revenge on the gang, killing them off one by one. This movie may be predictable but is well done. It's raw feel and lack of any real musical score are effective in a film like this. The rape scenes are famous for their realism but I wasn't as impressed with them as others. The only one with acting experience was Camille Keaton who did a nice job as Jennifer. As far as the gang goes, I thought Eron Tabor, who played Johnny should have pursued more acting roles after this but didn't. This is a decent little revenge flick if you're into that sort of thing and even if you're not, check it out just for the Joe Bob Briggs commentary track. He has some interesting and amusing input as usual.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie Ever Made??? I don't think so!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this film, even though Roger Ebert still to this day refers to it as the worst movie ever made. Granted this is NOT a pleasant film to watch but anyone who would actually take the time out to watch a film titled "I Spit on your grave" would most likely already be aware of what they were getting themselves into. This is the ultimate rape/revenge film. In fact, 3/4 of the film consists of footage of the lead actress (Camille Keaton, a perfectly charming person whom I had the privilege of meeting on one occasion) being raped over and over again. It is an extremely brutal and realistic film. The acting is above average for an exploitation film of this type. I do not consider this film to be degrading to women in any way, shape or form as many people claim. In fact, I find quite the opposite to be true. The main character in the film is portrayed as a strong, independent woman whose will to survive out shines the vile act of her violators. She rises above and extracts brutal and vicious revenge on the perpetrators and therefore is, by far, the strongest character in the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of this film. I thought it would be strictly an exploitation flick, I will the central ideas are somewhat in that vein, it is done in a manner that demands respect. The director takes his time building up to the eventual unpleasant scenes which take place in the first half and then also builds some suspense in depicting the inevitable revenge which is promised in the title. The direction has a pseudo documentary style with lots of wide shots and scenes where the camera assumes a voyeuristic position as if looking across the lake or the road with binoculars. The contrast of the ordinariness of the town and its simple folk to the savagery some of its residents are capable of adds an extra bit of power to what transpires. Kudos to all the lead actors for investing themselves into scenes that must have been extremely difficult to be filmed in. Notfor all tastes but a better than average entry of its type.</fullReview>

This film also works through its lack of musical scores throughout the film as it seems more like a documentary especially during the rape scenes and the director does not attempt to hollywoodnize by presenting rape in an offbeat, hip kinda way but merely presents to us all for what it really is sick' degrading, putrid, vile and nasty. This film is not for the weakened heart but it deserves a lot more credit than it gets. this is a very powerful film about despair, loneliness, recovery and revenge.</fullReview>

I saw this on video out of morbid curiosity, because I had read a couple of really abysmal reviews. There is a fascination with bad movies. Especially disturbing ones. After I watched "Day of the Woman" I would never forget it. It is truly a disturbing piece of work. It is without a doubt devoid any style and has minimal production values. The dialog is quite threadbare as well. It has that grainy and B-Movie quality, or lack thereof, but this works to its advantage. The worst scenes are of course the rape scenes and the notorious bathtub scene, which really freaked me out and scared the living snot out of me. The way the woman handles all of this is sadistically cool and nonchalant as if she knows what she's doing. At first the men seem to be the menacing and dominant figures, but she strikes back with a conniving and shocking vengeance. This is pure trash that lives up to its purpose; To shock, to frighten, to repel and to commiserate one of the most hideous human crimes, rape. Don't expect to enjoy this film on any level unless you are a vicarious sex criminal. The purpose of this film is to only shock.</fullReview>

But don't let that put you off watching it.I didn't actually find any gore or repulsive scenes as such, apart from when the girl relieved one of her attackers of his genitals in a bath tub. The rape scenes were long but not gratuitous, mainly because they didn't really show anything more than a mainstream movie would. Yes, their is a lot of nudity male and female, but no graphic sex scenes.The harrowing bit is more watching the woman in her traumatised state after the rapes. which are carried out with an alarmingly casual attitude by the 4 men. She is bruised, battered and can barely walk, but each time she thinks its over there is more.Whereas some films leave the victim desperate and shocked, this movie does the opposite and shows her planning her revenges against each of the perps. Each goes in a different way. I watched this to see if it was as nasty as others have made out over the years, no it is noway near as nasty as I was thinking. But still worth a watch as it is a unique movie.</fullReview>

Castrations, axings, and hangings galore ensue for the rapists, and as always, normal people will cringe and (rightfully) say it is an unnecessary piece of garbage, while us horror fans will have the supreme honor of saying that we sat through such garbage. Despicable? Yes. Moronic? Yes. Gratuitous? You bet! So why would anybody sit through it? Just to say that we did! It might be trash, but since it has angered and offended so many people, it's trash worth watching (at least for horror buffs).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film deserves more credit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this film twice. First, I watched the movie. Second, I watched it while listening to the director's commentary. Meir Zarchi explained where the story originated from. In real life, he encountered a ghost-like rape victim, who was brutally gang-raped by two men in a park near his home. He and a friend sought help from the police for the woman but he was dissatisfied by the cops' condescending attitude towards the woman. He tells her story in graphic detail and the results closely resemble what happens in the film.I believe Zarchi was making more a of a fantasy with this film. Yes, in real life, terrible rapes occur on both women and men. Usually, survivors will fight their rapists in courts.This movie takes a vigilant turn. The survivor gets revenge by acting out exactly what she would like to see happen to these monsters.Maybe that was uncomfortable for some to see. But I don't see the killings as more harmful than our "classic" Freddy and Jason movies. Those films were far more damaging than this film.Perphaps if the cover of the film were cosmetically different, there was a soundtrack, better audio, a bit more script, ONE short, visually obstructed rape scene and "softer" killing sequences after a not-guilty trial verdict, more people would adore this film. It's not pretty and the revenge murders are not as plausible as they should be. But it's a movie, let's not forget that. Zarchi takes the horror of rape and matches against the slasher quality of the 70-80s horror films.This was a very real depiction of how rapists injure their victims during their attacks. Zarchi captures the body movements, disregard for the victim's body, anger, and disgust of a rapist. Jennifer's second sequence against the rock said more than any script could. This point transitions Jennifer into an emotional zombie. This scene to me, captured all the pain and internal shredding that occurs in rape. The violent finale, where the last rapist rams a bottle into her vagina shows the competitive, sadistic nature of a gang rape. I believe this is why the revenge killings did not bother me later in the film.Overall, the movie is pretty good. In my opinion, Zarchi could have done better. But he admits during the filming he was inexperienced. I am not so cruel here. I do appreciate Zarchi's work. He does not glorify rape by any means. If the film bothers you, ask yourself if this rape could really happen to someone? Then ask, if the revenge killings could happen. You can separate the reality from fantasy. See "Soul Plane" for the worst movie ever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was in for a shock when I saw this. The rather simple story of 3 guys helping their nerdy friend "get a broad" turns into one of the nastiest rape scenes since Clockwork Orange. In it's simplest form, the story shows the oppression of women. It's portrayal of men as animals (the wild hooting from the boys as they're about to rape her) shows how men have always seemed to dominate for a long period of time over women. Her revenge shows the uprising of women in society, although this is shown as a dehumanization process, rather than anything glorious, that she has sunk to as low a level as the boys. Even at the end when she has the chance to let it go and forgive, she still attacks with ferocity. The film shows no one as a 'good person' but rather as dark people twisted by human urges.the film is definitely not for the light-hearted, so if you think you've seen it all - brace yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The greatest classic horror film ever (and it has a serious message)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I 1st encountered this film about 4 years ago on a pirate video (I now have a NTSC uncut Video) and was amazed. There are many films out there that claim to have a message but none are so powerful as this one. The message is to any potential rapists "sometimes they fight back!" and boy does this woman do so. I have no inclination towards raping someone but if I did I would be put off by the events in this film. Its a clever film in that just when you think it shows the rapists as the stronger characters it turns it around and shows you not only the victim as the stronger person but how the victim feels towards her attackers afterwards (in no uncertain terms).This being a movie the heroine gets to do what every raped woman would love to do, extract her revenge on her attackers and this is the films strength as it shows how raping a woman can be easily done but just as easily revenged. It really is a classic film that should be in every revenge flick fans collection (DONT BUY THE U.K VERSION THOUGH AS ITS CUT BY 7 MINS 2 SECONDS! THIS IS THE BEST ADVERT FOR A MULTIREGION DVD PLAYER EVER AS THE U.S VERSION IS UNCUT!).Perverts will be disappointed as the scenes are clearly not there for titillation but to bring home the horrors of this most horrible crime. The second rape is particularly terrifiying as it takes place with her being held over a rock. Its scenes like this that are the film's strength in that not once do you see any close up's (which would imply that the rape was there for sheer titilation) the filming of these scenes is done entirely from a distance so instead of glorifying it, it shows the full look of terror on the woman's face.The film then takes on a different meaning as after she is raped again at home it becomes a story of the aforementioned revenge. This is where some of the best scenes in the film occur. It certainly is a film that you will never forget. A bona-fide horror classic but one with a message that needs to be listened to.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Spit...(pause for dramatic emphasis)...On Your Grave. SPOILERS INCLUDED.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There has been so much written about this film, both pro and anti, that it has become very hard to simply view it objectively. Combine that with the decades of controversy, multiple bans, court cases and alleged cases of imitative sexual violence that have dogged I SPIT almost from the start, and you have enough mental baggage to floor any sane person before the film even begins. Is it a simple exploitation piece? Is there a feminist agenda at work? Does it glorify rape or simply present it as the vile, degrading crime it surely is? All these questions and more raced through my brain before, during and after the film, and having watched it twice in succession in preparation for the writing of this piece, I have come to the following conclusions.Firstly, I SPIT would appear to be too slow and deliberately paced for the majority of today's more demanding horror audiences, who demand wild effects work and CGI insanity, and (thanks to the machinations of Hollywood, always trying to go one up on the last blood-drenched slice of popcorn gore) invariably get it. For the first twenty minutes, very little happens. This, I believe, was an intentional decision on the part of director-screenwriter Zarchi - he's trying to show us both sides of this quiet backwater town, both from the point of view of an outsider (in this case Jennifer, the victim, to whom it provides all the solitude, tranquility and natural beauty she demands from an ideal working environment) and those who've spent all their lives there, to whom the resolutely uneventful burg represents a constricting and suffocating trap, where nothing ever happens or changes, everyone knows everyone else, and where there really is nothing better to do than a spot of late-night fishing because the movie house is running a film you've already seen. Their decision to taunt, annoy and finally rape the newcomer seems to spring out of their collective stultifying boredom as much as it does any predeliction toward rape and degradation.Secondly, I SPIT contains a lengthy twenty-five minute sequence in which Jennifer is gang-raped, sodomized, beaten and violated with a bottle. None of this is presented as 'cool', none of it is sensationalized or even stylized, and not once are we allowed to sympathize with the attackers, who are unfailingly portrayed as a bunch of sneering, braindead losers. (Why anyone would want to commit rape and GBH in order to imitate the greasy borderline psycho Stanley, let alone the jabbering, slow-witted Matthew, is beyond me, and places all the charges of imitative violence that have been brought against I SPIT in serious doubt.) Zarchi uses locked camera angles - a tactic familiar from hardcore porn, but alien to mainstream (and most exploitation) cinema - to further alienate the audience. This gruelling sequence seems to be the point of contention for most critics, simply because Zarchi has made things TOO difficult for them - his objective, documentarian viewpoint neither condones or condemns the crime, but to some small minds - and I expected better from Siskel and Ebert, as well as the usually insightful Kim Newman - a lack of condemnation amounts to a message of unwavering support, an idea that falls flat on its face given Zarchi's unflattering portrayal of the brutal rednecks who sneeringly destroy Jennifer's world.Finally, the revenge sequences, one of which presents a rightfully infamous moment in horror history (you know what I'm talking about, and if you don't, you must have had your head in the sand since 1978), are not "perfunctory", as some writers would have you believe - they are executed (no pun intended) with the same level of unfeeling sadism and shattering callousness as anything presented in the horrific middle segment. Yet Zarchi doesn't shift gears into high-octane exploitation, he simply shows the revenge process in the same flat and dispassionate manner as he showed us the succession of violations, never once painting Jennifer as some kind of heroine (this is by no means a gender-switched remake of, say, DEATH WISH, where vigilantism is presented as a quick-fix solution rather than as another problem entirely) or even as much of a human being - in fact, Jennifer seems to become an unfeeling, emotionless cypher, completely detached from reality and focused on nothing but vicious revenge. The final shot of Jennifer, sailing serenely out of the hick town (and, indeed, out of the film) with a small, wry smile on her lips is one of the most haunting in the long history of extreme cinema.The final point is, I SPIT is extreme, it does take risks, it does push back the boundaries, but never once at the expense of its deceptively simple approach. Zarchi shies away from any sense of commercial gloss or audience manipulation, instead presenting his virulently anti-rape parable as that rarest of beasts (at least in the exploitation field) - a film that relentlessly wrong-foots the audience. If you were expecting a bit of juicy fun from a film with such a lurid title and ad campaign, tough beans, pal; Zarchi means business and he's going to grind your face into the sleaze as hard as he can. Similar (in more ways than one) to Wes Craven's equally gut-wrenching LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT and every bit as troubling, I SPIT is a brave and important film that deserves to be seen at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I amend my earlier review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a follow-up to an an earlier review, which I would like to amend after recently seeing GRAVE again and listening to the commentaries on the Millennium edition DVD.In that review, I sided with the folks who defend GRAVE for portraying the true ugliness of rape, and thus refuting some offensive and downright dangerous myths that have caused women so much grief over the years. I haven't changed my mind, but I have come to realize that in the process of refuting some of those myths, GRAVE has unintentionally supported several others.On the one hand, GRAVE tells you men who commit rape are NOT simply decent guys who got carried away by their impulses. Johnny, Andy, and Stanley are sadistic bullies and Matthew is a mentally challenged misfit who's willing to deny his conscience in order to keep his friends. On the other hand, these guys are all members of a lower social class -- a class with manual laborers at the top and unemployed deadbeats at the bottom. Johnny runs a service station, Matthew is a grocery boy, and Andy and Stanley do nothing but loiter around Johnny's service station all day. The tacit message seems to be that members of this class are more likely to be rapists than are college graduates, white collar professionals, university professors, and men from similar classes.Of course, you can argue that one shouldn't make such a general inference from only four characters in only one movie. I concede that I don't have proof, but I do have evidence over and above the movie itself. First, there's Meir Zarchi's commentary. Zarchi comes across as intelligent, articulate, even compassionate, but also as a bit of an intellectual elitist -- the kind of person who would feel that the white collar/academic community couldn't possibly contain any rapists. My suspicion is fueled by Zarchi's description of the four actors who played the rapists. He claims they're all nice, decent guys, and supports the claim by saying they're college educated.And regardless of what Zarchi's intended message might have been, research has shown -- I'm thinking in particular of the work of Dr. George Gerbner -- that what people see in the media affects their opinion of the real world. Gerbner's work concerns mainly television, but I think it can be applied to movies viewed through the medium of video.To counteract this bias, I'd suggest reading YOU MUST BE DREAMING by Barbara Noel, with Kathryn Watterson. This is a true story of a woman who was allegedly raped by a respected member of the academic community. (To be fair, I should point out that it took me a long time to see this bias and identify it as a problem with GRAVE -- probably because I have two masters degrees and a white collar job.)Now, lets move from people to circumstances. On the one hand, GRAVE shows us that rape is an experience women DO NOT invite and DO NOT enjoy. As film critic Joe Bob Briggs points out in his feature-length commentary, Jennifer continues to try and fight these guys off, even when she's been injured to the point where she can hardly walk. On the other hand, GRAVE suggests that rape is always the culmination of an unsolicited and unwanted encounter with a total or comparative stranger. In fact it can often be the case that rapist and victim are not strangers, and that the rape was an unexpected consequence of an encounter the victim entered into willingly. This is in fact where the term `date rape' came from. Getting back to YOU MUST BE DREAMING, the alleged rapist was the victim's therapist.Again, there's that argument about making a general inference from one example, and again I cite the media's power to influence the viewer's perception of the world. And, according the Meir Zarchi's commentary, the experience that inspired the movie involved a woman raped by a gang of strangers.Moving on to other matters, I originally complained that GRAVE degenerates into a simplistic slasher movie because Jennifer becomes a one-dimensional killing machine. I am now inclined to agree with Leonard Wolf that the point is to show how rape injures the soul as well as the body.But I'm afraid I have two new complaints about the revenge portion of GRAVE. The first one occurred to me as I was listening to various statements in both commentaries about this being a pro-feminist film. I find myself wondering if the murderous Jennifer Hill is really what women want people to think of when they hear the word `feminist.' Yes, feminism's want women to be considered equal to men, and some of the more extreme ones do advocate female superiority and a matriarchal society. But do they really want women to be perceived as sadistic, ruthless monsters who achieve their goal through torture and murder? If they want any kind of constructive, positive relationship with men, they're not going to get it that way -- Which leads to my second new complaint, which occurred to me when it was pointed out the Jennifer uses sex as a tool to exact her revenge. This actually undermines the anti-rape message by associating consensual sex with danger. When Matthew and Johnny enter into sexual contact that was initiated by Jennifer, in which she's allowed to have control, they get themselves killed. This could possibly make some male viewers wary of entering into any sexual relationship where the woman is given any control whatsoever. Again, you may say I'm making an unjustified inference, but again, I cite the power of the media.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truly degrading. WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a tale of a woman writer raped in the country woods by rednecks, who then retaliates by luring them back to her retreat and murdering them in various ways.Meir Zarchi doesn't pull any punches with this film, which I saw in an uncut version as part of an ICA Censorship season back in 1999. For the most part, as with films of this nature, there is a reasonable structure to the piece which is overshadowed by some questionable elements, which I suppose would not make the film as effective if they weren't in the film.As with STRAW DOGS, the woman is not given a process of escape. Like the men in DELIVERANCE, the concept of judge, jury and executioner where there is now law is a preferred option when they kill one redneck and then chase another away after the rape of Ned Beatty, Camille Keaton's character, clearly traumatised, is not going to sit still and allow herself to be victimised again, so murder becomes a solution. The open ended climax makes the idea more disturbing than less and doesn't solve the predicament of what should happen when a woman is attacked.At a time when domestic violence is under the spotlight again, I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE provides a degrading insight in human nature.</fullReview>

How would anything like this even be possible? There is not the slightest explination to why these people victimize the women or why she chooses violent revenge instead of police. And why should we care? Rather this movie is a representation of the internal confusion of victimization in feminism than a representation of something which makes sense beyond victimisation.

		<fullReview>I've seen the Gator Bait films, and this is almost exactly the same thing as those. A woman is sexually assaulted by a group of degenerate men and systematically exacts her vicious revenge on each of them. The thing that sets this movie apart from those ones (although not very far) is that the sexual content is not glorified. There is full frontal nudity many times throughout the film, but not for a second is it ever sexy. Some of the rape scenes might seem a little extensive, but that's only because the movie is trying to strengthen the audience's need to see this woman seek revenge.This is a weak film, it has no other way to maintain interest other than manipulating our natural desire to see this woman get revenge on her attackers. I Spit On Your Grave is not the kind of movie that you expect to deliver a serious moral, but I was glad to see that, since it contained a significant amount of violence inflicted upon the female lead, it was not meant to pass off as a T&amp;A film.B-movies are notorious for being driven by nudity and out of control adolescent sexuality, and while I Spit On You Grave is unmistakably a B-movie and contains more than its share of nudity, the nudity does not drive the plot. On the other hand, the only thing that drives the plot is an empty necessity for revenge against a group of rapists. These men are evolutionary drop-outs just like they were in the Gator Bait films, and the biggest challenge for the writers seems to have been to come up with new and exciting ways to kill them, but the reason the film can never be anything more than a meaningless B-movie is because it does not deliver a message of any kind, but instead it simply satisfies the audience's desire to see a bunch of rapists get exactly what they deserve. The one problem that this leaves is that we have to sit through the sexual attacks. Oddly, the first half of the film is the part that contains the most nudity (although not by much), but it is by far the most painful to watch. We are even let down a little as we watch the woman obtain revenge since a couple of the deaths were so elaborate that they were obviously impossible (it seems like pure luck that the guy in the lake at the end felt such an overwhelming desire to hug the motor on the boat and press his genitalia against the propeller, staying that way while the woman yells some final words at him and pulls the cord), but again, this movie satisfies only the desire for revenge that the first half filled us with.(spoilers) You know that this is all the movie means to do, since it literally ends the minute the last guy is killed. The woman does not live happily ever after, she doesn't write her book, she doesn't leave and never return to that nightmare place, she just gets in the boat and motors around the lake while the movie simply stops in its tracks. But hey, what more did you expect?Oh, and did you read the tagline? If you decide to waste your time watching this, try and find any man getting broken or burned. I was really looking forward to those?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Renaissance Revenge Drama? NO!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Meir Zarchi's _Day of the Woman_, released in America as _I Spit On Your Grave_, has been lauded as "a classic in the revenge genre." Certainly, there is some merit to categorizing the film as a "revenge" piece. However, those critics who acknowledge this film as a "revenge drama" do grave injustice against the tradition itself, which originated in the Renaissance under the direction of such famous playwrights at Thomas Kyd (_The Spanish Tragedy_), John Webster (_The Duchess of Malfi_), and even William Shakespeare (_Titus Andronicus_). _Day of the Woman_ is more of an attempt at cultural commentary than it is a work of art in the revenge drama vein.Zarchi, an Italian director of low-budget horror pictures, creates horror films that are very similar to some of his other Italian contemporaries, namely Lucio Fulci (_Zombie_ and _The House by the Cemetery_) and Dario Argenti (_Suspiria_). Zarchi also is influenced by American auteurs of the horror genre in the '70s; no doubt, Wes Craven's _Last House on the Left_, another work of exploitive revenge within the horror genre, is influential to Zarchi's _Day of the Woman_. Understanding the influences from which Zarchi's film arises, it becomes much more easy to recognize how this film is not original, nor worthy of recognition alongside other works of art within the revenge drama genre.The 1970s was an enigmatic decade, marked by both apathy (brought on by the Vietnam conflict and later Watergate) as well as activism (feminism, multiculturalism, and gay rights strengthened their political and social standing in the United States). For both of these reasons (and others not discussed), American society demanded answers and punishments for any "crimes" directed against a "common good." Even the popular literature originating out of the time, like _Ms._ magazine and _The Advocate_, is a clear indication of this assertion._Day of the Woman_ serves a purpose, then, for Zarchi: the woman gets revenge on those men who humiliate and degrade her. The problem with this motivating principle is simple: the men are reduced to caricatures of the typical "backwoods redneck," the woman is the prototypical high class, professional "bitch," and the setting is influenced directly by _Deliverance_. Virtually every aspect of the film, therefore, is borrowed, contrived, and inconsequential.Moreover, the film itself lacks the depth of a well-written revenge drama. The political intrigue, filial sense of duty, and social ostracization of the condemned protagonist are missing from Zarchi's film. Some critics may refute, saying the film is very political in its portrayal of the woman getting revenge on the abusive man. They may even counter by stating that the woman is ostracized socially by her action. My objections to these comments are brief: 1) if this film is attempting to be political, it does so outside of the dictates of what true politicism is . . . and that is anything but revenge-oriented. 2) if the woman is supposedly ostracized by her acts of revenge, the audience never sees this as the film ends with her wielding an axe above her head, careening her boat down the river. (No doubt, another weak political and social statement which Zarchi attempts to make.)When comparisons are made between Camille Keaton's character in _Day of the Woman_, to Hieronimo in Kyd's _Spanish Tragedy_ or even Titus Andronicus in Shakespeare's play of the same name, this wronged protagonist lacks the intensely psychological and moral dilemmas which afflict her Renaissance prototypes.I give this film 3 out of 10 stars. While my review has been mostly negative, I cannot deny that this film has been influential to up-and-coming horror directors. It also is a comment, albeit a weak one, on the social environment that fostered it. It is a film that should be watched once and viewed in the context of which it originates. If this viewing experience is achieved, then perhaps the audience can even have a laugh . .. or be so completely offended that they never watch another film in their entire life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disturbing film and difficult to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film reminded me of the movie "Last House on the Left" only nobody, I mean nobody can try and act like the great David Hess, king of villans and a perfect actor rapist. This film was about a writer that comes to visit a remote, quiet little town to be secluded in her own little world to sit by herself in her cottage and write her next novel. She then stops by a nearby gas station who later on finds that the workers later become her worst nightmare. She is later bothered by these obnoxious perverts and a retarded friend who rides on a bike delivering groceries to nearby houses. I can't tell you the details of what these men do to her but I can say that I can't emagine any female going through what she went through. She was raped repeadedly by the gang as they kept forcing the retarded guy to have sex with her for the first time. After that got old, they just dicided to have her for themselves. they have no compassion, mercy or pitty on the poor woman who is left there to suffer. They rape her in the woods where she's left to walk around naked, dirty, bloody and left to walk home alone. As she finally gets home, she tries to call the police but low and behold, the rapist beat her to the house first and finish her off there. Is there any end? Anyway...... after all this brutality she does not deserve, she makes her mind and seeks revenge on them one by one. The rest is to be seen but keep in mind, "vengence is sweet." A good movie, but I can only bare to see it once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Slow-moving, unpleasant and disgusting horror film about a writer (Camille Keaton) who leaves the city on holiday into a quiet town so she can concentrate on writing her current novel. It isn't before long that she is stalked by four hicks (one of them retarded) who rape and beat her repeatedly and leave her for dead. Afterwards, she seeks revenge on her attackers in the most unpleasant and disgusting ways. This trash is about as sick as Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left." To be avoided.

		<shortDescription>A surprisingly good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you approach this film as a low-budget genre film and don't expect the production values of a James Cameron blockbuster or the acting of Hollywoods finest you'll get a lot out of this.The acting is better than most low-budget movies I've seen (Camille Keaton and Eron Tabor are especially good) and the story is logical enough to get the directors ideas over. The rape scenes do last for a long time but by the time they're over you can almost feel what Jennifer Hill feels and this sets the film up nicely for the finale.My only major criticism is that the BBFC's cuts to the new UK DVD version have watered down the rape scenes and removed some of the impact of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tough, important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To the narrow-minded, this could easily be dismissed as an exercise in cheap, exploitative mysogyny.What we get instead is a disturbing portrayal of rape at it's most brutal and unforgiving. Yes, it's graphic and takes up a 3rd of the film - but shouldn't a rape scene make it's viewer uneasy?! Far more honest and harrowing (which is a good thing) than the stylised view of rape that mainstream Hollywood took in THE ACCUSED, Zarchi's film pulls no punches yet ultimately ends up being a feminist statement ... Each male character is written as a stupid, sexist redneck with no understanding of basic social values. The only character we can possibly relate to, then (even as a largely male audience), is the woman. Her convalescence is brief - her revenge is swift but satisfying. We root for her.Also, we must take into account the fact that although there is a lot of nudity in the rape scenes, Zarchi has obscured breast and pubic hair for the most part - and even when they are exposed, everything is filmed in such a manner so as to eliminate any prospect of eroticism. This isn't turn-on sex - it's ugly, just like rape is in 'real-life'!!Sure, there are genre trappings along the way - and, yes, it does bear low-budget limitations - but ultimately the reputation is warranted completely. A hard-hitting, well-meaning partner piece to Craven's like-minded LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low budget, but a ball busting look at women in the 70`s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Spit On Your Grave (the better title, I think) is a lot more then a low budget film and to sign it off as a wanna-be horror flick is superficial. The lack of music certainly draws attention to the one scene where there is music. The graphic nature of the rape and the resulting revenge grabs you by the balls (even if you`re a girl). The effects are not great but we`re talking low budget here. It`s visually a harrowingly realistic film. Also, take the film into context: it was made during a revival of women`s lib and makes a severe comment towards the movement and the position of women in society at that time. The evolution of Jennifer demonstrates three stereotypical views of women but the transitions between each are smooth and believable. The male characters are intentionally caricatures but they are not completely one dimensional. In fact, if you analyze the script, bare as it is, every line has something to say about the character saying it.This film came after movies like Russ Meyer`s crazy depictions of ultra violent, sex crazed vixens and before films like Cronenberg`s The Brood. It is a low budget and obviously the director`s first film but it demonstrates some interesting points about what was going on during its creation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" is one of the most controversial films of all time.It's explicitness and brutal portrayals of disrespect for women are shown before our very eyes.Although "I Spit on Your Grave" is one of the worst films I have ever seen and is offensive,I was not offended by this film.I do believe that the fourteen dollars I spent on this garbage was fourteen dollars that I wasted."I Spit on Your Grave" is probably the second worst film I have ever seen."Salo,or the 120 Days of Sodom" takes top honors as the worst film of all time so in the case of "I Spit on Your Grave",this was a film that I just did not care for while "Salo,or the 120 Days of Sodom was a film that I had no respect for.Released in the late 1970s,the film concerns the story of an attractive female(Camille Keaton) who travels from New York to Connecticut to write her first novel.Four men she becomes acquainted with brutally rape her three times leaving her for dead not knowing she had survived their attack.This attack sets her on a murderous revenge spree that showcases the main character's own sense of justice."I Spit on Your Grave" may have been a film that I would have enjoyed when I was a lot younger.But I am old enough now to realize my judgment in certain films.And I also have respect for women.I have seen movies involving rape scenes and those films were good because they had characters and a story that I could be attached to."I Spit on Your Grave" simply had no story.It's a huge headache that fails to go away even after you turn off the television."I Spit on Your Grave" is a waste of my time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a revenge film with no deep insights</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Spit on Your Grave" is writer-director Meir Zarchi's notorious entry in the revenge subgenre, a film that shamelessly riffs on "Last House on the Left" but doesn't retain the level of story (as minimal as it was) and characterization that film did. The plot is very basic, and unlike other films (Abel Ferrara's "Ms. 45," for example), it's just flat-out rape &amp; revenge: beautiful young writer Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) rents a summer house in upstate New York, only to have her vacation shattered by four local hoods (including a retarded delivery boy) who drag her into the woods and brutally rape her. Leaving her for dead, she slowly recuperates and takes revenge against her attackers, in ways that are, well, pretty unoriginal.Part of me can believe that the sketchily-drawn characters (both the rapists and the female protagonist) and the lack of music were intended to bring about a feeling of documentary reality to the film, and that only succeeds part of the time. I cannot believe for a second that the rapists could predict exactly where the bruised and beaten female would head next in the woods, nor do I believe that they would fall for her seductive come-ons once the act of revenge comes about. On top of this, the rapes seem badly overacted and Zarchi's camera is always peeking in, like he's as much a voyeur as the audience.ISoYG is the type of movie that gets trashed by the people who made "Forrest Gump" and "Titanic" box-office hits. Genre fans who appreciate low-budget films of the 70's and 80's might get something more out of this--it certainly isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's also not the best--but the film comes across as a 5-page script with no character development, conventional gore scenes, and a lot of improvised misogyny. Even something as low-brow as a genre film needs a little more than what ISoYG offers. As a disquieting distraction, you can do worse.</fullReview>

Even though some do enjoy this as a pure horror film, the films message is the power of woman. Not having any dramatic music during the rape scenes only make the film more real with a message. Alfred Hitchcock did the same thing in several of his movies to draw suspense. Example, Sabotage...at the close of the film, no music is heard during the entire scene at the Statue of Liberty. Why? It made the moment more real to the audience. Zarchi knew what he was doing.....good work</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bleak and brutal, this is a hard film to defend</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people see this film as unredeemable and vicious exploitation. Yes it is an exploitation film but it's also an extremely effective anti-rape film. The lack of cinematic artifice (no music score) gives the film a certain hyperrealism that makes the grueling rape of Keaton all the more hard to stomach. The lingering nude shots of Keaton firmly place this film within the realm of grindhouse trash but Keaton gives a courageous performance in a role that could have easily been overplayed. The film also paints a dire portrait of the male race as retarded and/or repugnant with little compassion for the pain of others. But keeping the characters of the rapists one-dimensional makes the revenge by Keaton a little too easy to swallow. The movie definitely makes the viewer feel Keaton is justified in her actions, even though it is revealed one of the rapists has a wife and two children while another has the mental capacity of a 10 year old. Like CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST this film condemns the very images that it openly sells for profit.</fullReview>

Basically, a woman rents a summer home on a river to write a book and is raped by some locals, and then she gets her revenge on them. 45 minutes of it is very brutal and graphic. It's not a bad movie. They did a good job with what seemed to be no budget and the acting was better that a lot of low budget films I've seen. It's just tough to sit through. I didn't watch it with the glee of watching something like "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" or "Deranged". For a good revenge movie, I would wholeheartedly recommend Abel Ferara's "Ms. 45".</fullReview>

Four guys continually raping a screaming, mud-soaked woman? What kind of person would this film appeal too? Who would want to watch a long, graphic rape scene? How can anyone admit to liking this piece of trash? Her eventual murdering of her tormenters was no justification for the atrocious events of the first half of the movie.If anyone needs to be shown the difference between "good" bad taste and "bad" bad taste, look no further- this is the worst of tastes, and nobody really needs to watch it ever again. </fullReview>

It IS sickening, especially the graphic rape sequence and the nasty penis-chopping bath scene. The lead actress walks through the whole thing as if zombified - either she can't act or this is a remarkable portrayal of trauma! Avoid this if you want a film that gives any insight into either crime or revenge but worth seeing if you're prurient or fascinated by the depths of the human spirit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A powerful and shocking film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After reading the many comments concerning this infamous title I felt I needed to jump in and defend it. I expected trash, but I was surprised at how powerful and moving this film is. The beautiful cinematography (which greatly contrasts the brutal nature of the film)is well done. I thought the story did much to humanize the female lead by showing a spiritual side. She visits a church before going on a justified murder spree. I feel that this film is challenging in that it is confrontational. I found myself wanting to see these men die, even after realizing that one had a wife and kids. I was surprised by the amount of animosity that I had developed during the first half of the film where the lead female is raped. But this is how these "revenge" films are made. Not unlike Craven's Last House On The Left (a far superior film), the first half the viewer is confronted with transgressive violence, the last half is where the viewer vicariously releases this anger and frustration through the lead character (much like the parents in Last House). I thought the characterization in I Spit was slightly weak. But, this didn't hold the film back at all. In the end I was drained, disturbed and moved. I don't feel misogynous. I am not psychotic. I do allow myself to get completely lost in cinema and let films take me where they go. If this is with films like I Spit On Your Grave or Fellini's 8 1/2, it does not matter. Give I Spit a chance if you haven't and decide for yourself.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film has been marketed as some sort of feminist vengeance movie. It isn't. It is true that the victim murders her attackers after being raped, but only after becoming a brutalised madwoman (hardly a feminist role model). The rape scenes are so long and the revenge so short (and silly) that it is impossible to see this as the film's message.Possibly the most offensive aspect of this film is that the victim willingly has sex with two of her attackers (after being raped and sexually tortured) and even pretends to enjoy it, as part of her retribution. This is psychologically bizarre, and made me (and every other woman I know who has seen this) actually feel ill.It is difficult to know what the purpose of this film is. It would not be easy to find the rape scene titillating, unless perhaps you are a member of a particularly pathetic group of lads on a boys' night out. Even real losers would leave the cinema squirming rather than aroused - the penis-severing scene would make sure of that (see other comments).My conclusion is that the most appreciative viewers of this film are probably real and potential sex criminals, who presumably watch the rape scenes (the majority of the film), and then press the stop button before the slaughter begins - unless of course they are also interested in torture and violent death (inflicted on either sex) which I suppose is unfortunately quite possible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was really freaked when I watched this movie, I even felt bad for poor Camille Keaton when she was being abused in the film.. Its true this movie contains very strong scenes of rape and violence, but that does not mean it's a bad movie. I cannot say that I enjoyed "I Spit on Your Grave", on the contrary, it bothered me very much. I think this is a good movie for it is totally realistic, and that's what I liked about it. That it shows an act of abuse as it most explicit and believable form. Some characteristics that add the realism are: that there is no background music through the whole movie. Second, nor Camille Keaton, nor the other actors in this film seem to be acting, it all looks very real. It doesn't even look alike a movie, it looks more like a documentary. The rape scenes are very cruel and intense, but towards the end when she recovers from all the damage, sweet revenge arrives to punish them all. The first act of revenge is good, but the second one is very well elaborated and it looks extremely grotesque and painful, very painful. The other two acts of revenge are not that elaborate. Anyway, "I Spit On Your Grave" is a movie that will make you sweat, it will make you nervous, and make you tense. It is very explicit and it is definitely not suitable for any minor. It is rated R, but in reality the movie should have been rated NC-17. It's a good movie, very strong, not very enjoyable, but well directed.</fullReview>

I have just watched it again on NTSC USA video where it is amazingly unrated, because I believe every film has a right to be seen no matter how deplorable the material it contains. And this one is certainly that, it is a vulgar, vile exploitation movie and just portrays the prolonged rape of a woman (played by Camille Keaton the granddaughter of Buster Keaton no less, he must have turned in his grave seeing this) by four men who then survives this and seeks revenge. It is flawed in many areas and the frugality of the film is so apparent. It looks like a cheap Italian film, the actors seem dubbed and the location looks like an outback of Southern Europe. Not surprisingly, all the people involved didn't appear in hardly any films after this one, and the director made only one more. This is the epitome of a pure exploitation picture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The question of censorship?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There have been two occasions in my life that I have beared witness to this film. The first being in 1983 when the home video phenomina swept the world and ordinary folks were able to create their own special video memories, while also for the first time (apart from television) were able to rent films and watch them in the privacy of their own homes. The term 'Video nasties' comes from this period of time and under that heading comes this film. It's original title makes this film sound as if it is a celebration of womanhood. A pro-feminist film? Written by men? The distributers had a brain wave by re-naming it 'I spit on your grave' Why not, they had to make money and all the video's that were coming out at the time were of the horror genre. 'Evil dead'- banned in alot of countries, 'Blood sucking freaks' - controversially mysogonist, 'Driller killer' - notoriously gory. Thinking back to 1983 when I was 10 years old sitting in front of the television watching these naughty rated R films with the local neighbourhood kids made us feel grown up that we were watching these unobtainable HORROR films against our parents consent and the governments demands to have these films banned. Interested, I rented 'I spit on your grave' a second time in 1996. After the closing credits I turned to my friend and told him that this was not the film I remember from 1983. Because at the time I remember us kids cheering and yelling and basically enjoying the film. Today I look at the film as one that has no redeeming values. How did the main actress submit herself to such a role? Are these film-makers really clever or just plain stupid? It is terribly entertaining to witness a woman being sodomized for what seems to be the whole basis of the film. It wasn't enough to have her raped by three rednecks once, it happens twice! And how do you think our main protagonist becomes this woman of the day? She gets hers back by killing them all off one by one. How does she achieve this? She leads them into a trap by letting them rape her a third time! If there was ever an art form that could demonstrate, not only the sufferings, the happiness but also how people really think about our world, is film. These film-makers know nothing about creativity. They certainly made money from it's notoriety (Trivia: name another known film by these same film-makers, without searching out their filmographies) This film is a put down on human life and how degrading it is knowing that there are more talented people out there who could have turned this material into something more thought provoking and questioning the topic of rape. This film conjures up a word that I am totally against into my mind. The word being censorship.</fullReview>

The production values must have been low, but that's not a significant reason to call I Spit On Your Grave (I've never seen or heard it be called Day of the Woman before) a bad movie.The cinematography is strange. I must admit the camera angles can be a little, hm, unnerving, and sometimes appear to be shot from a hand held camcorder. That's the reason why I only gave the movie a 9. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie.The plot is thick, or at least compared to several other movies that I have viewed. And the plot is very enthralling. This movie shows the horror of rape, and I feel that it does an excellent job at that. The post-rape revenge section is great. All of the death scenes look realistic, and are simply exciting.Another user commented negatively about the absence of music. I have never before seen a movie without any music, and it is ingenious. The no-music atmosphere puts a very realistic edge on this movie. For instance: In a real-life murder, one does not hear eerie music or the classic "Ree-Ree" sounds. The absence of music is original and highly effective.I Spit On Your Grave is one of the most original movies that I have ever seen, and it will probably stay that way for the rest of my life. The movie is mesmerizing, and the performances are top-notch. This film is like no other, and I highly reccomend it. If you don't like this film, you must only be looking at the surface. Dig deep down into the plot and performances, and you will find a fantastic movie that will never be topped.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was a kid, my parents would take me to Fry's (AKA Kroger) and bored with grocery shopping, I would hang out in the video rental section ? we had recently got our first VCR. I would spend a good 45 minutes to an hour there, mostly in the horror section, reading most, if not all the back of the box descriptions. I wasn't allowed to rent any of them, as they were deemed Satanic and inappropriate for any age. One I wanted to see was 'I Spit on Your Grave (AKA The Day of the Woman)' and ironically, I have to agree with my parents on this one, finally seeing it twenty or so years later. And not because of the subject matter, which in itself was bad. It was just the horrible sound ? character's voices obviously filmed in some studio VS the actual scene. It was the fact it was one hour, forty minutes, but seemed like they literally had 30 minutes of substance stretched far too thin. It was the bad acting, the shock for shock value only and the unbelievable scenes/actions of the female lead. As simple as the movie was, the plot's simple to describe: woman writer leaves New York for the safety of the small lakeside town only to be brutally gang raped by four men and after recovery she all but stumbles upon seeking revenge in very sadistic methods. It falls under the same genre of sick/twisted/revenge horror flicks of the 70s, such as 'Last House on the Left.' So if you're a fan, watch away. And make sure you watch the special features. I was laughing at some of the foreign-released VHS covers that showed pictures of Jason Voorhees (Why?) and the trailers that state she tortured and burned (no she didn't) five men (it was four.) And even more funny was the trailer narrator seemed bored while reading the trailer 7+ times and all but yawned when he got to the final word: "Grave." Hilarious.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strong rape revenge movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There be SPOILERS here.OK lets get some facts out. * Yes, it has the longest rape scene in any movie (at about 30minutes) during which time she is raped 4 times) * The director made this movie after he helped a rape victim in real life * Although the rape scenes are very long, they aren't overly exploitive, they are mostly shot on the rapists or Jennifer's faces.On with the review. I first rented this film when I was like 15/16 cause it was "Banned in Australia" (I'm an Aussie) and figured it's gotta be good. It was in the horror section. I've since then seen it on DVD, and watched it with commentary on as well.Pigeon-holing ISOYG into a category is difficult and somewhat impossible. The movie's plot, that is Jennifer gets raped than murders the rapists, is the entire movie. There isn't a sub plot or virtually anything else going on. It's simply rape and murder. It's for this reason, and the very long brutal rape scene, that many critics have panned it. Ebert in particular wrote a scathing review saying how appalling it was.I disagree. ISOYG has a exploitive subject matter, and there is nudity, but it doesn't ever show the rape as a titillation. The nature of the film was 2 fold. Firstly to show the brutality of rape, than to have a 'happy' ending with the revenge of Jennifer. But it's not a softcore porn. So what purpose does it hold? I think the answer is, very few movies show the truly horrific nature of rape, especially when ISOYG came out. Since then, we've had Irreversible, War Zone, even Pulp Fiction to a lesser extent, all show some brutal scenes, but I think ISOYG was probably the first.It's not a good movie, it's not a bad movie. It's not an in depth plot and it's not very titillating. So what is it.ISOYG is probably best considered a benchmark. It's a movie that the director said 'I want to make a movie showing the brutality of rape'. ISOYG did what nothing had done before it.Now, 30odd years after it came out. I'd say see it for the sake of seeing it. It's an important movie to see so you can say you've seen it, even if you loathe it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent first rate cult flick! **** out of 5</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not sure what's with the low rating here but this is really a cult classic. Having just watched this for the first time last night I was somewhat expecting a shoddily made terribly written trash epic, that would have been cool too cause being a fan of cult film, I like that stuff. But imagine my surprise when this turned out to be a well directed film that featured good acting and fantastic suspense sequences.There is nothing about this film that glorifies rape. It is filmed in such a way that we detest what is happening on screen. It baffles me how Roger Ebert (my favorite movie critic by the way) can call this the worst film ever made and praise Wes Craven's "Last House On The Left" (He gave it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars!). I always had a problem with that film because it tried to incorporate scenes of a bumbling sheriff and his deputy in between the rape scenes, which to me, just felt wrong and out of place and anything but funny.Basically in the first hour of I.S.O.Y.G. it is about a young woman who comes decides to vacation at a lake for the summer and as soon as she arrives, she's raped by four men. The second hour is about revenge. The film features many memorable death sequences but the castration scene is by far the most harrowing and suspenseful scene that I have ever seen in a film. I have never cringed so much in my life.Admittedly the film isn't flawless. There are times where things work out a little too conveniently for Jennifer. But we might not have the film we have here if they didn't.It is a must see for any horror fan. But be warned... it can be very hard to watch. It is a true cult classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst films ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Personally I'm a big fan of low budget exploitation films. Particularly ones from the 70's. However they still have to be decent, I can't like something because it fits in to one of my favourite genres.I Spit On Your Grave is a pretty poor example of film making. I had the misfortune of renting this on DVD after looking quite forward to watching it, since it was previously banned and there's something exciting about watching a movie that was banned. Unfortunately at that time back in the 80's they seemed to ban anything and thus many rubbish films that otherwise may have disappeared in to obscurity gained a reputation they perhaps did not deserve. This is one of those films.It was so intensely boring and badly made that I ended up fast forwarding to the 'good bits', i.e. trying to cut out all the padding and get to some good stuff. Turns out there actually isn't any good stuff. Very poorly made film. Atrocious script, acting, directing, everything! There is not even a hint of music to add some atmosphere. I can only assume they did not have the budget to pay a composer so decided to leave the music out. Needless to say the effects are laughable.This film really is unbelievably slow and uninteresting. It should be banned again so people wouldn't have to endure it! :o) Even the death scenes were pathetic - which is really the whole point in this film isn't it? To watch the woman wreak revenge? I couldn't care enough about the woman though, to care whether she got her revenge or not.Superior exploitation films that are actually pretty good despite their occasional cheesiness are 'Children Shouldn't Play With Dead Things', 'Deranged', 'Dead of Night', 'The Exterminator', 'Vigilante', 'Maniac' &amp; 'Motel Hell'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've heard about this one for 20 years and never had an opportunity to see it, so when I came across it in Hastings' used DVD section, I just had to pick it up, if only to see if it's as awful as people say.Yep. It sure is.I think a lot of people who praise this film mischaracterize the opinions of those of us who despise it (even Joe Bob Briggs, in his amusing DVD commentary, makes this error). So let's establish right off that this film is not pro-rape, that it does not take the position that gang-rape is an acceptable hobby, and that the rapists are clearly the bad guys here. Right?That's not the point. The point is to show a beautiful naked chick in scenes of extreme, bloody sexual violence. Whether she is passive victim or castrating bitch goddess hardly matters as long as she is naked and covered with gore.I guess what I'm saying is, this one is for men with serious mother issues.</fullReview>

Lord knows, we already had Last House on the Left (which is just as bad), Death Wish (comme ci, comme ca--after all, the movie perverted the message of the book), and Straw Dogs, not to mention revered movies like Rashomon and Virgin Spring. Why make a revenge movie without any artistic merit at all? The whole thing (no spoilers--this is all given away on the package) is a girl gets brutally raped multiple times by a pack of no-good hooligans, recovers, then kills them all (including the mentally handicapped one) in brutal fashion. Oh, and she's a writer, and that's why she had moved to a cabin in the woods.Anyway, that's the entire movie, including the extent of social commentary therein (the irony of the brutality, however, is my invention, not the movies).

		<fullReview>This movie definitely ranks high among the worst films I've ever seen. The only disturbing thing about it is how badly made it is. The characters are wooden, the acting is terrible, the plot is unbelievable, the pace is mind-numbingly slow and I've seen better direction from high school students. For me the rape scenes were more laugh-out-loud funny than shocking. After the incredibly ridiculous, unnatural ways in which the male rapists are thrashing around in this overly drawn-out scene it's a surprise that when we next see them they're not wearing neck braces; and some truly terrible camera angles are used. There is nothing remotely feminist about "I Spit on Your Grave". Sure, the plot is about a woman getting revenge against male oppressors, but it's clear that the intention of the film is to depict a lot of gratuitous nudity and sadistic sex, not to make social commentary. The female protagonist is at times infuriatingly stupid and ineffectual, and the revenge scenes almost seem like an afterthought. For a supposedly notorious banned film, this seemed pretty tame to me. It''s not scary, it's not dramatic or suspenseful, it's not particularly shocking, and its only point seems to be mindless titillation. Nevertheless, I don't believe in censorship, and I believe that if for whatever reason people want to make or watch films like this, they should have every right to. (As an afterthought I'd also like to add that I was very surprised that a film that has been banned in this country for several years now is so easy to find on the shelves of suburban major-chain video stores...) 1/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember watching this film when I was younger around 17 and such and anticipating one heck of a brutal exploitation film . Popped in the tape sat thru a horrible hillbilly opening theme song and was prepared to be scared or grossed out or repulsed never expecting to actually be bored out my mind.Note to aspiring film makers. A score is a very important tool to have in your film.It sets the mood. I don't mean songs...i mean incidental music that for which this film had none. Nothing to set the tone except horrible blue grass music during the opening credits.Not even an additional piece of music..on a radio, a car radio or anything. Silence. Silence to me, sets the tone of induced boredom. This film is like watching a home movie...Ya know Last house on the left was the same kind of movie but the main difference was that film has songs and a score..Crap. Although the bath tub scene really stood out for me as I am sure it would for most males viewers...ehhh...otherwise don't waste your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I keep going over the movie in my head and trying to find a redeeming quality to no avail.My boyfriend and I purchased this movie because he had heard from multiple people that this was such a great movie. If I ever find out who these people are they have it coming to them!After entirely-too-long-rape number 2 we resolved to watch anymmore rape scenes in fast forward wich I would highly suggest to anyone who still has some sadistic drive to watch this movie.If this were a splatter exploitation flick it was poorly done. The nudity was not at all sexy and the action blood and violence in act 2 of the movie where our leading lady is getting revenge needed to be much more. I can safely say that if there were only the first rape scene and the rest of the movie was Ms. Hill stalking and brutally murdering the gang of rednecks, it would have been just as justified. The reason I think this could have been a flick of this genre is due to the lack of resolution for Ms. Hill and the Waky nerdy rapist character whos only purpose seemed to be to provide some sort of comic relief (although, this character just seemed entirely inappropriate when set against the brutal rapes that take up a good third of the movie. There really is no possible way to provide adequate comic relief after you see five brutal rapes).If this were suppose to be a powerful and dramatic commentary it still would have ranked low with me. The dialogue was awkward at best and the lack of artistry gave way to a feeling that you might be watching a snuff film. Does our heroine get any resolution? No. Has anyone, including the audience, learned anything or walked away thinking? No. My stomach was churning and even though she killed every last rapist (in the most illogical order, might I add, as it relates to the relavence of the rapist characters) I was still not satisfied. There truly was no good story here. Women gets raped a bunch; Women kills the perpetrators; The end. Women does not start a rape counseling center, women does not give us any clear sign that she feels avenged, women does not clearly lose any kind of innocence--nothing! And I don't know if any of those scenarios would have helped the flick.In conclusion I feel this is a clear example of bad filmaking in every aspect. To say it is "Powerful" or "Important" means you may just be seriously over thinking it or desperately trying to justify your wasted hour and a half or so. The SOUTH PARK MOVIE was in comparisson far more "Powerful" and "Important" than that piece of garbage someone tried to pass of as a movie ever will be.So what did my boyfriend and I do with this little gem, you may ask? We wrapped it up and gave it to some unfortunate soul at a dirty santa party. I deeply apologize to whoever got stuck with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Horrifying. This movie was just that, and not because of any spine-tingling action or suspense. It is THE most dreadful production .... EVER. It's more than the utter violence and blood, it's the fact that it isn't even packaged worth a damn. Before we even get to the marathon rape scenes, you have shots of characters from about 50 yards away, yet the sound gives you the impression you are standing right next to them! Qualities similar to this plague this movie from start to finish.But for me to nitpick that kind of stuff when dissecting this piece of trash is ridiculous. Don't fall into the trap of the box in the video store (admittedly, I saw this box in my hometown video store back in the mid-80s and wanted to see it; over a decade later, I finally went through with it), this movie should have been banned by anyone with taste because it sucks. To think I read the summary on the back of the video box and still rented it! When I read "a retarded fellow and his backwoods buddies rape a woman," did I think they were kidding? There's a good 40 minutes to back up the claim! And to single Matthew out as the "retarded" one is a bit demeaning to the ol' grocery boy.The castration scene actually got a reaction out of me (that's the one thing I'll give this movie, that part was somewhat engaging) but overall this was the worst. Stay away, unless you absolutely have to see this crap to believe how bad it is! In that case, don't blame me!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brave take on the rape-revenge tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fact that Roger Ebert labelled this movie as the worst ever made was actually a great deal more shocking to me than the feature itself. I studied "I Spit on Your Grave' as part of a film violence course at university and was subjected to Ebert's disturbing views on rape revenge and movie violence in general. Ebert feels disgusted by this feature, he feels dirty as he leaves the theatre and is depressed by the immense feelings of guilt the images have left him with. Is this not how one should feel having witnessed a rape (fictional or not)? Would he have felt cleaner if Zarchi had fragmented Jennifer's naked body, had used atmospheric music to eroticise the rape scenes and depicted the female character as enjoying herself even just a little bit? In my opinion one should be disgusted and shocked senseless when viewing such material, and in this sense I feel Zarchi has achieved what many others could not. I think it was brave of the director to put such footage out there, even if he lets himself down with the more generic revenge sequences towards the end. Ebert talks about how he thinks that as a viewer we are subjected to the rapists' p.o.v. and goes on to say that this is a major reason he was so offended by the film. However, if Ebert knew anything about p.o.v. he would know that the audience is put into the place of Jennifer, given extreme close ups of the mens' distorted faces as they rape and mutilate her. We follow Jennifer in her journey from New York and most notably we stay with her during her recovery. The perpetrators are depicted as stereotypical and one dimensional, not to mention uneducated and unattractive. Therefore, if Ebert finds that he is relating to the rapists, rather than the intended Jennifer, I think the problem lies in the critic's psyche, not the feature.To top it off, Ebert reminiscences about the loss of the art of feature films, as displayed by the likes of slasher extrodinaire John Carpenter. The opening scene of Halloween then, shot literally through the eyes of faceless killer Michael Myers as he plunges a kitchen knife into the naked breasts of his older sister, is obviously good clean fun in the distorted mind of Roger Ebert.Don't be be put off by the hype surrounding this movie. Yes, watching these rape scenes is an ordeal that will never leave you, but a film about rape shouldn't be inoffensive. To date I have yet to see such a violent, brutal and disturbing depiction of a such a violent, brutal and disturbing crime. In my opinion, sexualized and eroticised versions of violence as seen in Halloween, Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street are far more harmful and offensive.</fullReview>

Also, the revenge the woman exacts on her rapists isn't really that impressive...pretty much exactly what you would expect from a standard slasher flick, complete with the obligatory cut-off-the-bad-guy's-penis scene you just knew would be in a movie as tasteless as this one. If you want to see a movie that has earned its cult status, then watch "A Clockwork Orange."

		<fullReview>I am not one for hyperbole, or lists or such for films, but I agree with Ebert (for once) that this is the worst film I've ever seen. The film is awful; there is not one aspect of the film that even justifies its existence. The story is forced, the direction heavy-handed, the plot is ridiculous, and it feels like the makers decided to change it from a porno to a horror film in the second act. The film doesn't have any sort of meaning, yet because it tries for meaning doesn't even make good theatre of cruelty, or something of a naturalist piece. The worst thing is that the film isn't bad enough to be campy, so it is utterly joyless. There is nothing enjoyable or worthwhile in this film. Outside of the lead, the acting is utterly horrid, even for a low-budget horror film. I watched this expecting something disturbing and shocking, but really the most shocking thing was that I wasted my time on this. It's not really that disturbing by today's standards. Even by the standards when it was made, when compared to The Last House on the Left, or Dilverance, which are both superior films, and more disturbing, it isn't effective. If you want to see a notorious video nasty see something like Cannibal Holocuast, that at least says something and has some value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to know how not to make a film, watch this. A fundamental problem with the film is that there is no music at all (apart from some classical music playing in the background in one scene). Music is ESSENTIAL for creating atmosphere of any kind. As a result, the only atmosphere in this film is that you're watching some amateur footage of a real event, though even that idea is destroyed by appalling acting and ludicrous characterisation.According to the video cover, the film is about one woman's trail of revenge on the men who raped her. In actual fact, there is a disturbingly excessive rape scene (stretched out over 40 minutes or so), followed by the four, quick deaths of the rapists. The ONLY effective scene is one in which the lead rapist's penis is cut off in the bath and he is left to bleed to death. The other three deaths are so mundane that there is no real sense of justice in them at all.The only reason for seeing this film is merely because it is so notorious and like so many REALLY bad films, it has to be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

The revenge murders are predictable and not graphic (ie, not gory in the tradition of slasher or giallo horror films).Clearly the sole reason this film was made was to make money from mentally ill individuals who enjoying watching a woman being raped, beaten, degraded.Is this film the cause of sexism? No, of course not. Is it in bad taste? Obviously. But WHY watch something which is highly unpleasant AND lacks any artistic or technical merit? Likely banning or crusading against these type of film only makes them more appealing to those who oppose censorship and seek out things which are transgressive. I also oppose censorship and enjoy transgressive cinema. But if you read other comments you will see that people who have sought this movie out for those reasons did not enjoy the experience and felt they had wasted their time and money. I would suggest you not make the same mistake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A flawed milestone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stickered, censored, and sectioned upon its release, this notorious piece of sexploitation is the quintessential rape-and-revenge flick, what with its running time being near-monopolised by both aspects of that equation. Attempts to craft a compelling narrative prove tenuous, mere threads to sew the polemically-driven action and reaction sequences together. Somewhat reminiscent of both Deliverance and The Last House on the Left, this combines the city-fish-out-of-water element of the first with the lust for vengeance animating the latter.For better and worse, this film ticks many a "feminist" box, living up to its Day of the Woman subtitle: on the positive side, we see vengeance exacted by the victim of violation herself (? la Inez Garcia), thus affirming a message of radical personal autonomy (as opposed to the family values vibe I got from the vengeful parents in TLHotL); on the negative side, the ONLY male characters seen in the film are snap-reactive, id-enslaved predators, set off by the first slip of skirt that crosses their path (a trait which our heroine exploits with her feminine wiles, come her revenge). All I'll say is that Valerie Solanas' knickers would be soaked if she watched this one! As for the notoriously prolonged gang rape, it's amazing how the passage of time makes the once-shocking look rather ridiculous. Scenes of the sobbing, soiled lead staggering from one stage of her ordeal to the next are undermined in gravity by the cartoonishly overacted writhing of her rapists. Perhaps copious viewing of extreme cinema has "desensitized" me, but I find it laughable this film caused all the commotion it did on account of those scenes. I expect it's a case of me having to be around in '78 to take in the full impact.All in all, despite its time-blunted edges, I'm glad I watched this rapesploitation milestone. What it lacks in certain key areas, it makes up for with a satisfying denouement featuring what's probably the most memorable closing line in cinema. Maybe one of these days I'll check out the recent remake to see whether or not it addresses its precursor's shortcomings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not what I expected...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As quite the fan of exploitive and idiotic and unintentionally hilarious horror films from the 70s and 80s, I actually watched this because I was expecting some tawdry thrills.What I got instead was something truly horrific...and that is precisely what it should be. It was actually this movie that taught me that truly capturing the essence of violence on screen means it is NOT entertaining to watch. This film has a decidedly unfair reputation as trashy exploitation. As a viewer of many films of that type, I can very safely say this film is NOT even close to that.To put it bluntly, the trash makes rape easy and even fun to watch. This film makes it exactly how it should be for any serious film maker: Bloody hard to watch. Sickening, in fact. And NOT entertaining. Watching this movie was probably the most painful, uncomfortable and unpleasant 101 minutes of viewing I've had since I first saw Cannibal Holocaust. In many senses, this film was ahead of its time - in fact, it still is given that we still see movies that will play on the idiotic concept that a woman looking provocative is somehow an incentive to rape. Or that the perpetrators must be completely 'evil' in all aspects of their lives to keep them one-dimensional and thus keep us from feeling any sympathy or understanding for them.The woman in this film is liberated and very human. The 'villains' act despicably and yet are also very human. While the acts themselves are revolting, the sick and twisted human element behind them is ultimately the most frightening and horrific side of it all.As to the acting, Camille Keaton is astounding. You feel every bit of her pain.Others who actually understand this film have certainly described its merits infinitely better than I ever could.All I can say is that this film is immensely powerful and despite being over 30 years old, it's a damn sight more feminist than most modern rape-themed films.I was sorry to hear about the remake. Especially because it appears to have missed the mark entirely - lovingly lingering on the revenge and making it as trashy and gruesome as possible.Ultimately, I think the title provides the most fitting mantle in the case of the original and what it's all about and also how the remake missed the mark:The original was intended as "Day of the Woman".The remake stuck with "I Spit On Your Grave".If a trashy and critical reputation is deserved, I'd save it for the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent entry, if not overtly spectacular</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I Spit On Your Grave" is a decent if flawed Exploitation entry.**SPOILERS**Driving to a summer house, writer Jennifer Hills, (Camille Keaton) leaves New York for the countryside air and a relaxing vacation. Attempting to write her new novel, she meets up with Matthew Lucas, (Richard Pace) and his friends Johnny, (Eron Taylor) Stanley, (Anthony Nichols) and Andy, (Gunter Kleemann) and proceed to torment and terrorize her. Starting to crack under the pressure, she finally reaches a breaking point when she is viciously raped and beaten three times in one day by the gang, leaving her a broken mess. Thinking that she has been dealt with, they leave her to die, only to find out that she has staved off death and is still alive, looking for revenge. When she comes back looking for revenge, she takes them out one-by-one until she has rid the gang and exacted revenge.The News: As far 70s exploitation goes, this one has a real claim to being one of the better ones. The main centerpiece of the film is the rape scenes, and these are among the most uncomfortable and destructive scenes in the genre. Each one is pretty graphic, and each have their own special place to be recognized. The initial one comes with a fun chase through the woods before the encounter that has something to get excited about. The second one is perhaps the most visual uncomfortable, what with the position of the body during the event and the general disgusting location to hold it. The last one, which is inside, holds the most out-right exploitative, due to the circumstances surrounding the event and the repeated cries of the onlookers. That violence is actually used for the first time besides restraining, as well as the fighting back before and during the scene make it highly exploitative and uncomfortable as well. That the torment leading up to them is actually provoking certainly worthy of retribution on their own makes these even harder to sit through, and are certainly Exploitation material of the first order. These are also the biggest problem facing the film, as the need to show such material in graphic close-up is definitely something that a lot will avoid. It's a subject matter that will automatically be condemned for the very mention of it in a film, which is something that this one has only in a few moments, but will nonetheless be judged solely on that nature alone. Beyond that issue, the other big problem with the film is it's way too lax pacing. This is one of the best examples around where the over-long length really hurts it. This really could've done with about ten minutes plus of extraneous scenes cut, including one of the more obvious ones where the four pals are out hunting at night, discussing the situation before deciding to do anything about it. It's way too long to mean anything, and it really ruins the pacing by just taking up valuable time in the film and really should've been cut. Some later scenes, like the gang in the diner talking about it afterward or the adventures of them in town trying to seem normal while flashing around to her stalking them for revenge, as well should've been trimmed or removed due to the fact that they're only there to pad out the running time. Otherwise, there's no place for them in the film, as they're not conducive to the plot, have no bearing on how it will turn out and are just useless scenes that do nothing for the film. There's also the problem with the initial activity that seems a little off. It takes only a little amount of time to get over the issue, and even less to resort to violence against the perpetrators, and in the case of such an extreme act, it would've been a little more realistic to have it flash ahead for several months saying that the recovery time has filled in the gaps with the same situations playing out, making it feel like it was a traumatic event that really fueled up the fires to seek revenge, rather than being just the spark that caused a relative frenzy of violence to follow. There's also a relatively fun part in the revenge, which are certainly creative means to follow-through on and make for some interesting scenes later one. Otherwise, as an Exploitation film it's certainly not that bad.The Final Verdict: A prime slice of real exploitation, this one is a real take-it-or-leave-it affair, since the main source matter is too extreme for some to get over. If the subject matter appeals to you, it's one of the better examples available, though those that can't get over it should be well-advised to leave it alone.Rated UR/NC-17: Several intense Rapes, Full Nudity, Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and a sex scene</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's an exploitation flick, no doubt about that, but to instinctively say it offers nothing just because it's classified in those terms is rather narrow-minded, I feel. If the censors see fit to pass a film, then I think as far as possible we should leave our own personal moral judgements out of the critique and just try to see how well the director handles the story he's going to be working with.So, leaving the subject-matter aside, how well is the actual story told? Not exceptionally, but well enough to pass muster for those interested in the methods our female character uses to take her revenge. Somehow it was quite predictable that there would be a guy with mental difficulties as part of the group of attackers, but at least this explains neatly how he was drawn to his demise.Unfortunately not all of those who wind up dead can count upon 'diminished responsibility' as an excuse for their gullibility. The victim takes the time for her physical wounds to heal before essentially stalking without explanation those responsible for her violation. Do they stop for a moment when she returns to question if recrimination may not be on the agenda? No, they do not. They need little persuasion to leave themselves entirely vulnerable to someone they had degraded weeks earlier. This may be suggesting that they are entirely ruled by their anatomy, but it's still all too convenient and easy a process by which the script arranges for scores to be settled. Surely it's common sense not to accept an unclothed body massage from someone you've treated like dirt in the not-too-distant past?If you enjoy seeing very nasty villains getting their comeuppance in graphic ways, then my advice is to ignore the objections of the morality police and see this anyway to discover what you think.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher Film With A message</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great film. It is basically a slasher film about a really ugly rape fantasy that plays out on the screen. That already makes it unique in a category of film in which violence is bloody but not really disturbing. Relative to most slasher film violence, it is pretty explicit and disturbing stuff. But then the film morphs into a feminist version of The Wild Bunch. All of the bad guys get offed in bloody, ugly ways. And they are trapped by the original victim "seducing" them to get them close enough for the kill. Great irony in this all. Production values are good for a small, low budget indie film like this. Acting is, of course, uneven but the heroine does a credible job. Well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this movie very hard to watch but it's effectiveness is difficult to deny.The rape scene is brutal and it goes on and on and on. It's rather disturbing but it goes on so long that you start to feel numb. Some of the murder scenes are well done. One in particular is probably the main reason this movie is famous. If you can find a male that will watch this particular scene without turning his head away and cringing, give him a medal for courage. That particular scene is so well executed that it almost justifies the existence of this movie all by itself.The pacing of the film can be a bit too slow and the order that she uses when taking her vengeance leads to an anticlimactic ending. The movie has a very serious vibe most of the time, but if you look closely it becomes apparent that you're watching a simple exploitation movie and it's best not to let it offend you.I recommend this to people with strong stomachs who aren't easily offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One hell of an important film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a shocking film, dealing with a gang rape in explicit detail. It's constructed totally from the victim's point of view, and therefore is a powerful groundbreaking and influential film. Most films of this type, especially Hollywood versions, still dis empower the female character by having someone else, usually a male, take responsibility for the revenge; or actually make light of violence against women. This film unquestionably takes itself seriously. At first I had doubts about this, believing the retarded character of Matthew was intended as comic relief, but its actually just poor acting and the director's failed attempt to draw a meaningful performance from him. All the other actors do a good job, especially Camille Keaton's brave performance. This film shows such a clearly defined transformation from broken victim to vengeful murderer, in such simplistic terms, it takes on a strong allegorical and almost fairy tale quality. Almost 30 years old, it's influence can still be seen in films today, such as the more talkative "Hard Candy". I am amazed other critics and reviewers have claimed this film sympathises with the rapists, who are drawn so negatively they rightfully deserve the punishments given later in the film. You want these guys to die violently, and this interestingly raises the question: what is this film really about? Hats off to Meir Zarchi for making a bold, straight forward, uncompromising film. I just watched it on DVD, and in comparison to the VHS version I saw about 10 years ago, it is actually well photographed and not as cheap as it was previously and sleazily promoted. A very hard to watch, confronting, intense and grueling film.</fullReview>

I was routing her on.My only gripe was, WHY would a guy hang onto a boat, chatting with a woman that just nixed his accomplices, with the motor blades right in front of him? Come on!!!

		<shortDescription>Overrated by genre fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the more controversial exploitation films of the seventies, reviled by mainstream critics and adored by its fans. What is it? "A vile bag of garbage", so-called by Roger Ebert, or an emotionally powerful revenge film with a refreshing feminist slant? In reality, it's neither.Jennifer (played by Buster Keaton's grand-niece) is a sophisticated urbanite who decides to get away from it all, moving from Manhattan to a bucolic upstate town to work on her new novel. She finds the desired peace and quiet... until she gains the unwanted attention of four horny yokels: married gas station owner Johnny and his lackeys, including the mildly retarded Matthew.After she spurns their sleazy advances (these consist primarily of 'impressing' her with their motorboat), the men take her to the woods, rape her, and beat her. After letting her go, they intercept her and repeat the process twice. These scenes are easily the most powerful in the film, and form the basis for its unwarranted reputation. Keaton gives a convincing performance as she's relentlessly tormented by the rapists, and her anguished screams are disturbingly realistic.The men vandalize her house and leave her for dead, entrusting the bumbling Matthew to administer the coup de grâce. Needless to say, he fails to follow through. After Jennifer recovers from her ordeal, she sets out to avenge herself. She seduces the men, then dispatches them in various ways: one by hanging, one by castration (one of the most effective scenes in the film, likely because most of the gore is left to the imagination), one by axe, and one using the outboard engine of their beloved motorboat.The question is- does this film deserve the attention, negative and positive, that has been lavished on it over the years? The short answer is no. To be honest, it's simply not good enough. The low-budget origins of the film are painfully apparent in the stilted acting (Keaton is an exception), poor dialogue, and subpar camera-work. It's amusing that this rather unexceptional picture has acquired such a reputation... which means, of course, that Zarchi accomplished his goal.This isn't a terrible film, by any means. As stated above, Keaton is strong, the rape scenes are fairly disturbing and the castration is suitably repulsive. Every self-respecting exploitation fan should see this at least once, if only because of the film's notoriety. Watch it with low expectations, and you may even find yourself liking it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disturbing and repulsive rape and revenge horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rarely do you find movies that make you feel completely ugly, awful, disturbed, and in a plain nasty mood after you see it. Even rarer is finding a film that has absolutely no morals, ethics, limits, or explanations set inside it. So, from that standpoint, Meir Zarchi's I Spit on Your Grave is actually rather unique. It is truly the only film that I've seen that doesn't try to justify any of the disgusting or repugnant displays shown throughout. It exists as nothing more than a film meant to be as mean and filthy as it can be. It's also the only film that made me feel absolutely p*ssed off at the world after viewing it. While watching, however, I felt numb and weak. I felt like I couldn't move from the position that I was fixed into by a hopelessly disturbing and depressing movie. As soon as the ending credits flashed onto the screen, I was furious. It wasn't that I was mad at what atrociously sleazy trash the director decided to make, or how he decided to implement it. I guess it's just because it opened my eyes to how much the world really sucks. It truly exists only as a display of the most evil and disgusting acts known to man. Surprisingly, it ain't half bad.The plot is almost as simplistic as you can get. Jennifer Hill is a short story writer who heads to a cabin in the woods to have some alone time to write her new novel. She gets her groceries delivered by slightly retarded Matthew, who gets a bit of a crush on her. He goes back and tells his tougher, all-balls-no-brains buddies, and they get a kick out of it. So, the next day, they stalk Jennifer on a motor boat while she's canoeing. They chase her onto land, and they rape her. They let her go and she runs lost, dirty, beat up, and naked into the woods, where they're waiting on a large rock. They rape her again. She literally crawls back to her house, near death, and while trying to dial 911 on her phone, they kick it away from her and rape her again. This time Matthew finally has his turn at it, when he had all the opportunity to save her before. He's supposed to then kill her as the other three leave, but he decides to just pretend to kill her. So, she recovers, tricks Matthew and hangs him, castrates Johnny in her bathtub, hits Andy in the back with an ax, and guts Stanley with the motor boat's engine. The end.If you ever want to be grossly disturbed out of your mind, pick up a copy of I Spit on Your Grave. Simply saying the events like I did in the synopsis isn't enough. You have to see them to believe how incredibly atrocious they truly are. The rapes are unbelievably barbaric. They mostly include the men kicking and taunting a completely helpless Jennifer, shouting mysogynist interjections while one of the rapes her until she screams in pain, and then another one has a turn. It's so raw and incredibly painful to watch that several times I questioned myself as to what the hell I was doing watching this. I might have been able to answer myself and have turned it off had I not been so completely horrified into one position and distracted by more incredibly evil displays being shown. It doesn't rely on special effects to make it so disturbing. Most of the violence is graphic thrusting and sexual violence, but it even goes beyond that in the most disturbing moment I have ever seen in a movie. Jennifer has tricked Johnny into some sex while bathing, and while he is enjoying her gentle stroking, she sneaks in a kitchen knife and cuts his manhood away. What makes that moment in particular so disturbing is that he doesn't notice what has happened at first ("So sweet it's painful!"). Then he looks down, and a shot of blood squirts out. That position I was frozen in?! Well, I wasn't frozen for long, as I shot out of my chair screaming, running to the back of my room! It's an incredibly disturbing and horrifying moment, and it sums up the general nastiness and horror of the whole movie in one scene.But really, the only things keeping you to the screen are these disgusting displays, because it has nothing else going for it. All characters, including Jennifer, are scummy, evil people with no emotional connection at all (though supposedly Jennifer was shaped that way by her rape and torture), and Matthew, the classic comic relief, is possibly the most annoying character in movie history. His presence doesn't lighten the mood of the movie, and makes it only seem that female degradation and rape is fun, celebratory, cheery, and completely not serious. So, obviously, any acting is simply horrible, except during scenes of characters screaming in pain and agony. They seem to be very good at that, like they specifically practiced for those scenes only. The only redeeming qualities are accurate testaments of real evil that roams the planet, and it makes I Spit on Your Grave a hopelessly depressing experience, not only from the hate that spews out of the celluloid, but for the film-making incompetence that's present. This is only a good movie if exploitation is your cup of tea. (Un)Fortunately, it's mine. You've been warned. I Spit on Your Grave is one of the trashiest, most mysogynist experiences you will ever endure.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film about a woman who is brutally raped and seeks revenge has a notoriously bad reputation. Roger Ebert describes it as "a vile bag of garbage...lacking even simple craftsmanship." Actually, the director (Zarchi) shows himself to be a fine craftsman, with his camera work assured but not flashy. He creates a terrific atmosphere during the early scenes, slowly building up the tension. There is no score, adding a sense of realism as there are long stretches without any dialog. The rape scenes are long and show the brutality of the crime but they are not really graphic or exploitative. The revenge scenes are overdone and a lot of blood is spilled but it's rather restrained compared to many slasher movies. The script and acting are uneven, but this is a far better film than its reputation would suggest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Being a horror movie fan, I knew all about the past of I Spit On Your Grave and had read countless articles on the situation. However, although I wanted to see the movie, it was to see what all the fuss was about. I never actually expected it to be a quality, classic piece of film. Which it isn't. But its not that badly made. There is not much plot and the characters aren't given any depth, but basically, it does what its meant to: it shocks. I felt that this was one of the sickest movies I've ever seen, but the point is that the rapes and the violence show it how it is: cruel and unenjoyable. The movie at times is difficult to watch, I think the castration scene was the worst however. I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you are a fan of violent, cult horror/thrillers, but it is interesting, if disturbing viewing and, of all the video nasties, it probably is one of the most deserving of that title. Personally, I think I preferred Last House on the Left, which has similar themes or rape-revenge murder. Both need to be seen to be believed and I think they have stood the test of time well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, let me start out by saying I am a HUGE horror movie fan. It has been said this has "the most graphic and brutal gang rape scene ever". I was watching this movie, anticipating that the rape scene would really bother me, being a woman. I think there have been other rape scenes, which did not include multiple men raping one woman, that were way more brutal and got a gut-wrenching feeling from me. This was NOT graphic and it was done, for lack of a better word, in a tasteful way. I felt bad that she was raped, but the actors/actress did not make me hate them or feel for them. I really didn't care one way or another. I agree with another post that the kills were really the only interesting part of the movie - but it fizzled there too. The first two were good, but the last 2 were lame and it just seemed like someone on the production team said "Ok we need to finish up this movie now - and fast!" I'd recommend to see it if you are a big horror film fan, just to say you've at least seen it. But if not, and you are only looking for those good, scary films - there are so many other movies out there you could watch. And by the way, responding to another post - this doesn't even come close to Blair Witch. The first time I saw Blair Witch, I was scared out of mind. I felt nothing with this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exploitative trash... so bad it is disgusting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Camille Keaton's biography on the IMDb reveals that she was at some point married to director Meir Zarchi. That she divorced him at some point should surprise no-one who has seen this film. Her resume consists of little more than exploitation films, and that this, of all things, is a highlight can only be a sad come-down for a grand-niece of the legendary Buster Keaton. From start to finish, the film is torture for the viewer, as much as it tries to depict hell for the titular character. Day Of The Woman shows not a smidge of understanding of what it depicts, or those involved in its real-life equivalents. Meir Zarchi clearly fails to understand that sexual assault leaves a black mark not only on the victim, but upon the victim's family, the perpetrator's family, and to some extent the perpetrator, too. Instead, we have nothing but a woman being savaged from go to woah, without pause for thought or character development. We know little of the titular woman when the film starts, and only slightly more when it ends.One also has to factor in that the titular woman of the film does some seriously idiotic things in the lead-up to the vicious assault. Well, maybe I am being judgemental, but moving thousands of miles (seemingly) from civilisation to write a book, where apparently nobody but leering strangers know where you are, is not the brightest of ideas. Come to think of it, neither is filming a string of rape scenes that just seem to go on and on and on beyond all Human endurance. By the time the boys (one cannot call them men in any sense of the word) decide they have had their fun, one is half-hoping someone will just put her out of her misery (and the audience's). This is where Keaton really earns points with the proverbial jury - her portrayal of terror and pain is so believable that one almost wants the film to hurry up and get to the part where she gets her own back, so to speak.Unfortunately, films like The Accused do a far better job in this respect by showing how the police, doctors, and finally the legal system, basically make the victim go through the whole ordeal again, many times over. Instead, Day Of The Woman drags us through a revenge fantasy, one of the kind many of us who have been spat upon entertain, that is neither particularly satisfying nor original. We get no lead up into what makes our heroine decide to commit these brutal acts. She just gets up and does them, which is a rip-off when you consider that from the time these rapists get started to the time they finish, a full forty minutes of screen time go by. Any point that the film has is effectively neutered by the one-dimensional performances and story. If the point was to show this film to convicted rapists in order to make them see how ugly and dishonourable the act makes them, that is probably the only area where this film can claim to have succeeded. But that would make about half of this crap redundant.Roger Ebert described Day Of The Woman as the worst film ever made, or the most disgusting, depending on your source. Calling it the worst film of all time is glorifying it too much, especially since people use this description for films that entertain through sheer ineptness such as Plan 9 From Outer Space. Disgusting is a far more fitting term. While I would not go so far as to claim the rape sequences were just an excuse to show Camilla Keaton naked as much as possible (anyone who is turned on, so to speak, by this should get help). The redneck rapists must also be the dumbest men on the planet, if they are fooled into thinking their nerdy friend actually killed a woman when he presents them with a knife that is half-covered in blood. Stab anyone in the heart, you will be up to your elbow in it by the time you've made sure they are dead. Yes, it is inept, but if Ebert describes it as disgusting (his site appears to contain a different review to that exhibited on the Siskel and Ebert show), then I am right behind him. Roger says it best when he says "To hold his opinions at his age, he must already have suffered a fundamental loss of decent human feelings". This is a film that can be used to test people's humanity. While I did not feel as dirty after a viewing as Ebert says he did after his, the catharsis I normally would feel when the abused guts the abuser was just absent.It is for that reason I am giving Day Of The Woman a two out of ten. If it were bad enough to be good, I would give it a one, but this film is so far in no man's land that it literally stands alone. It is an excellent example of why no film should ever be banned - left to stand on its own merits, it falls apart.</fullReview>

So...if u want to spare yourself from a headache...please avoid this third hand cinematic Highly unrecommended 1 out of 10 ( and that only because i have no option for a zero...)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>quirky rape revenge brutality of the 70's kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most people whom have seen "I Spit On Your Grave" seem to feel this movie achieves a real emotional depth and power; as if it exemplifies rape violence to further our education. I think it comes down to Meir Zarchi directing a personal fantasy where in the beginning one is both disgusted and intrigued by the epitomized version of raping a woman brutally. At the end you sense that in this particular story the writer is truly reaping his own revenge simply by having made this movie. Physically the film is drenched in uncomfortably long scenes/transitions and bad attempts at suspense. The situational violence is all completely unrealistic with the exception of the bathtub murder which is where this movie really shines. Having experienced this scene makes sitting through all the badly written parts well worth it, you're going to feel the pain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's not much story to this movie so what I am going to say is going to give it away. Day of the Woman (I Spit On Your Grave) has the most horrid acts against a woman I have yet to see filmed. What these four men do to her is evil, poor acting, but horrible. Leaving it up to one to finish her off, the others seem satisfied upon his return and they leave her for dead, but she isn't and she prepares to get revenge... And what they get is what they deserve. The deaths are realistic, the end falls flat but how she did it was realistic to me because of how the characters are. If you are into vengeance movies, this is one to be seen. It honestly made me angry: I felt for her, I wanted her to kill them and no jury in the world could find her guilty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Can we say worthless! If this movie were any more exploitive it could have been a snuff film, this seriously one crappy movie, now I must say the movie indeed is seriously disturbing, but for the wrong reasons, where as Last House On The Left labored to tell a story about what would you do if the guests in your house killed and raped your daughter, I Spit is just a low budget crapper that is so poorly made and poorly recorded that the dialog can barely be heard. As far as acting goes it's serviceable, but overall this isn't as powerful as one would have you believe this is simpily garbage thrown together quickly to rip off Last House On The Left.Some have also claimed this to be a feminist movie, believe it or not. In anycase I Spit On Your Grave is an unpleasant, worthless and overall tedious movie that should be avoided.If this genre appeals to you, watch Last House On The Left and Deliverance instead.1/2* (Out Of Four)</fullReview>

Nice, huh? The only problem is that the film sucks. I find it very improbable that a lady as petite as Ms. Keaton would seriously inflict the damage done to the rapists. The film is amateurishly made. There is no music score, and not one (even the heroine) character is appealing.

		<fullReview>If that kind of thing (plus the incoherent story, the comical attacks, and the nonsensical denouement) doesn't faze you too much, the performance of Camille Keaton as the embattled heroine is worth watching. She manages to balance between hysterical Sally Field-esque overacting ("Eye for an Eye") and Little Wooden Girl Bridget Fonda (in "Break Up"). I kept getting this weird Heather Donahue burn in some of her close-ups and reaction shots. This movie isn't about empowerment or even how a sensitive, quiet woman can turn into a hard pipe-hittin' b*tch when messed with. There's nothing much of entertainment value or interest, except Camille Keaton's performance and that's not worth sitting through the whole movie for.

		<fullReview>Having read the various comments about this movie, I feel the need to add my two cents' worth.Let's get one thing straight. This is NOT a good movie. The direction is pathetic, the editing is almost non-existent, the script must have been made up on the spot (the dialogue is atrocious), the characters are stereotyped, the acting is worse than lousy and the sound unlistenable. Have I missed anything?For a horror movie there is no horror. For a suspense movie there is no suspense. For a titillation movie there is no titillation. For a character study there are no characters.I felt no anger for the perpetrators, no sympathy for the victim; nothing, for anyone.Some have mentioned interesting ironies or dichotomies. If such things exist (rich/poor, city/country, etc) then they are accidental. Some have mentioned the revenge theme and the transfer of power - merely excuses in my book.This is also not a 'classic' bad movie in the Ed Wood vein. At least Ed had the best of intentions. I see no intention here but an excuse on the part of the director to spend a large amount of time with a reasonably attractive naked woman - who, unfortunately, seems to have little or no acting ability (a definite minus, given that the movie hinges on her performance).I did not see the X-rated version, but the rape scenes that I saw were laughable. Seems to me the gents concerned had no concept of how to perform during sex, flinging about in all odd directions - in ways that would have reduced the opportunity for any physical satisfaction at all!! The revenge murders were also laughable. I don't know what the commotion is about the castration scene - certainly didn't make me twinge.I found myself fast forwarding through much of this. It could easily have been cut down considerably without losing anything, but then the total lack of anything approaching an acting performance would have made that effort a waste of time.Final comment? Don't bother.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great art or worthless garbage? Maybe a little of both.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Reviews of this movie, tend toward two extremes. Some folks feel it's a great work of art that's been going unrecognized, while others feel it's a repulsive piece of garbage with no redeeming qualities whatsoever. Well, I think this movie has both strong virtues and serious liabilities.The main point of disagreement among this movies critics seems to be the three brutal, ugly rape sequences presented one after the other. These sequences are graphic enough that the complete, unedited version of GRAVE has an X rating. Granted, these scenes *are* brutal and ugly, but that's the whole point -- to show the viewer what rape is really like. These rapists are anything but good old boys having fun. These are the sadistic bullies that make school and Summer camp a living hell for kids unfortunate enough to get branded as victims -- TOMMY's Cousin Kevin, magnified by a power of ten, using sex as their instrument of torture. In a scene I found especially effective, the rapists, having broken into the woman's house, find a piece of her writing and proceed to make fun of it, then rip the pages to shreds. Later, we see her taping the pieces together and retyping the pages, after having slowly, painfully, put herself back together. There's no way you can watch this movie and still think rape is a harmless, good-humored prank or a misunderstanding.As for the cheesy production values ? in particular, the lack of background music ? I think this was done deliberately to create the illusion that you're looking at documentary footage, a la THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Alas, everything this movie shows you about the ugliness of rape and the intensity of the pain it causes, ends up being merely a setup for an extremely simplistic, formulaic revenge story. The woman turns from an intelligent, creative artist into a female version of HALLOWEEN's Michael or FRIDAY THE 13th's Jason. Okay, there is a scene in which she goes to a church and prays for forgiveness before the fact, but it was a token gesture with no sincerity. I was especially bothered by the movie's deliberately ignoring a potentially interesting detail. One of the rapists, Matthew, is mentally deficient, and is pushed into the act by the other guys. No, that doesn't excuse his behavior. In fact, his participation has an added element of betrayal because he originally asked the woman if he could be her friend, but all these issues are simply passed over, since Mathew is the first one she polishes off.This was a movie that could have had a lot more depth and a lot more substance. Pity it ended up being no more than a slasher movie with the genders reversed.</fullReview>

The film could have paid more attention to the revenge (which is the main attraction to the male audience), showing how the woman elaborately sets her trap for her male victims. But all that gets over in double quick time. I would rate it as only 2/10 for erotic effect and 3/10 for story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay this movie is pretty bad. The first 40 minutes is rape scene after rape scene. They rape her once, the five minutes later they rape her again and then why not third time lucky. Then in the last 30 minutes we get revenge the killing of the four guys. Now of you've seen it what was that guy in the bath doing. "It so good it hurts" he opens his eyes, "Oh my god it's bleeding, you ut it" The film follows Jennifer, a writer who is working on a new novel and needs to get out of the city to finish it. She hires a river side apartment to finish her novel, attracting the attention of a number of male locals. They catch Jenifer one day and strip her naked for the Village Idiot(Matthew), to rape her, he can't or won't and so one of the others does it for him. Jennifer is raped a further two times, her novel is destroyed also, she then begins to seek revenge on the men who raped her. Now if you like rape scenes then another sex scene and a lead character walking around naked the whole film, then four deaths at the end then you might enjoy this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wish people would stop comparing this movie to "Last House on the Left." Why? Because "Last House" is a good movie. (Poorly made, to be sure, but an effective film nonetheless.) Meir Zarchi (writer/director of "I Spit on Your Grave") must have seen "Last House" and decided to try to cash in on the controversy it caused. Unfortunately, I think he succeeded.PROBLEM #1: THE TAGLINE -- Nothing like giving away the whole movie in the tagline. Oh, and "five men"? I may not be a math whiz, but I only counted four.PROBLEM #2: THE MOVIE ITSELF -- The first forty minutes or so were nothing but hooting and raping. (I mean, I've heard fewer annoying war cries in old "Cowboys &amp; Indians" movies.) And the rest of the movie (with the exception of the noose, which was stupid) was utterly predictable.Is there anything in this movie that makes it worth watching? Well, Camille Keaton is smokin' hot, and she's naked most of the time in this film, but other than that: No. Don't bother with this one. If you want to see what Meir Zarchi wanted this movie to be, watch "Last House on the Left". But try to avoid Vestron Video's chopped-up version.I spit on this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the sickening exploitation movie many think it is.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's easy to see why this film is so controversial. This story of a city girl who is victimized, then turns the tables on, four local country boys shocked a lot of people when first released some twenty-odd years ago, and it's just as disturbing today. The reasons why are as follows: first, the rapes and murders are depicted graphically, especially the now-famous bathtub scene (I'm surprised this movie got an R rating). Second, the film's shoestring production values only add to the realism. As many people point out, the film has no particular artistic merit, but this is exactly why it is so effective--at times it almost feels like a documentary or even a snuff film because there are no show-off camera moves or fancy editing styles. Also, there is no music score--the only music we hear come from a harmonica that one of the rapists plays, an opera record that the heroine listens to in her home, and some Muzak in the grocery store. The actors in the film don't really seem to be acting--it's almost as if they are playing themselves. The film is inspired by other movies like "Deliverance", "Straw Dogs" and "Last House on the Left". Although this film can't be compared to the first two, it is definitely better than "Last House", even though it was made by a much more famous director. Why Roger Ebert thinks that film is a work of art and this film is a piece of garbage is something he will have to explain someday. The film clearly establishes the differences between the city girl and the country boys. The girl is intelligent, educated, self-sufficient, independent, and beautiful. The men, on the other hand, are uneducated, immature, unattractive, and, in one case, mentally retarded. Interestingly, the retarded man is no more dumber than his cohorts, and he is as horrified as the girl when she is being attacked. Not that it saves him, however, because he becomes a participant before long. The girl is a successful free-lance writer living in New York City who comes to the country for the summer to write a book. The four men, in contrast, lead dead-end lives: two are unemployed and the other two work at minimum wage as a gas station attendant and a delivery boy. They dream of going to New York or California, but only to get laid. They seem to attack and rape the girl just to relieve their boredom. The only hobbies they have are fishing and driving their motorboat. When the girl takes revenge on them, it's as almost if she is doing them a favor, because they never had a life in the first place.</fullReview>

I must admit that it is not for everyone and should certaintly not be viewed by young children; but it should not be banned. The horrors of rape are depicted very explicitly in this film. I have not seen a rape scene so graphically displayed in any other film. The film is interesting and disturbing because it shows the complete disintegration of a young woman's mind in the aftermath of a repeated and intensely brutal violation of her body. Alot of the film is painful to watch but I do not think the director was going for shock value alone. How can anyone consider this a pro-rape film? It does not glamorize rape as I have seen in other films and the realistic images of the brutality of the action are ingrained in the mind long after the film is over.

		<shortDescription>I spit on your movie: It's not that good.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no need for this movie, when there are plenty of news of similar cases in real life. It's a just unpleasant film. Why would a movie about rape be entertaining? Who goes to see a movie about rape if not a little sadistic? I saw this movie, not knowing anything about the film only wishing to watch it because it was controversial. Now, I kinda wish I didn't see 'I spit on your grave' or 'Day of the Woman'. Most people might have criticism for the film due to its being too sadistic, graphic, and exploitative to ever work as entertainment; however, some people argue that this helps it succeed instead as a feminist film. The idea is that the first half where the male characters do a terrible, dumbass imitation of sexist predators and spend 40 minutes showing us the mechanics of rape "exposes" sexism and how bad rape is. Still, the rape scenes really went too long and too realism, and I understand why they did it so you can sympathize with her pain. Still, it was very unsettling. Then you got the woman killing all of them and it's supposed to help support women everywhere who went through those things. I do think it wanted to be a feminist film, but unlike supporters, I think the attempt is a pathetic, offensive failure. Isn't murder, worse than rape? If they swapped the genders, would the movie be empowering men against killing women if the women rape men? Even if a guy is rape by another guy, does it make it right to kill them? I just found it to be a bit mediocre on the revenge plot. As a rape-revenge film, it did little to make me sympathize with the obligatory female protagonist Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton). Frankly, we never see the transition of her character, recovering slightly, but then maybe going a little crazy and then finally in her brokenness coming to the resolve to kill all the men who raped her. She just gets raped and then turns into a serial killer. Instead of empowering herself, she came out as petty and psychotic. I'm not saying she wouldn't have the right to feel that way, but we don't really see her transition from point A to point B, so it becomes much more gruesome and disconcerting. The only character development I saw was that of the short church scene in the film with her praying to God knowing that she is about to commit murder. I would have love to see more of her questioning her actions or at less trying to seek the police help, and seeing that the police wasn't going to do anything it, that cause her to go into the low steps she went into. It doesn't help that she is nearly naked in shots before the rape and then continue to sleep with the rapists later the rape. The movie makes her seem like a whore, rather than a virgin. About the killings scenes, I don't know why the movie had the two nearly unknown guys Andy and Stanley die last rather than Johnny, the Ring leader or Matthew Lucas, the nerd. It would have better to save those deaths for last. Johnny is clearly the lead villain. People were kinda mad when she killed Matthew. He clearly has a learning disability, was coerced by the others and is not fully responsible for his actions. I was very surprised the film makers considered it acceptable for Jennifer to kill him without no regrets. I don't mind that she killed him, just wanted her to question her actions after doing it with a line mention or something. He wasn't an evil character, just don't understand limits. Still, he rape her, so he had to have some kind of punishment. The line she does use in the end is so cheesy. I just hate hearing it. The ending was pretty awful. It should have end with the Lorena Bobbit bathroom scene that makes people cringe. The sound was pretty bad, as it's hard to hear what is going on in some scenes, and in other scenes its background noise is louder than the voices. Overall: Violence against women is a more widespread and serious problem in society, and violence against men is not being taken serious. Movie like these created androphobia and misandry in women thinking of men. Movies like that also make it seem that men are Misogyny or oversexed. Honestly, in real life, a man are mostly likely to be killed by other men, than a woman being killed by a man. Not all men, are like these violent creeps in the film. There are men that respect women and can't harm anybody. This movie may of have just laid the formula for hundreds of pseudo-feminist thrillers and Lifetime movies, but altogether, you've got a disgusting, exploitative first half and an insulting second half that thinks it makes the first half worth your time. It's so bad, it's not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before I start, see the 2010 remake. Its a masterpiece compared to this crap. I started watched this title about a month ago. The whole things just got me frustrated. Bad acting, unrealistic completely. First shes like a hopeless puppy and then turns into Wonder-Woman! I mean come on for real? If you think about it, its like a bunch of teenagers made this. You can barley hear what they're saying, and a lot of the shots don't make sense. Plus there are a lot of goofs. Like one minute the guy is on a boat, then Hes not! For like 2 seconds! Normally I do not bash on older films. But after I saw the remake, (Which by the way was Pretty good I'd give it a 7.7 out of 10) and it was like comparing Einstein to Paris Hilton. Please do NOT watch this film. On the other hand, you should! So you can watch the remake and laugh at the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hypocritical and poorly made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not going to bother with a plot synopsis since you know what the movie is about and there's almost no plot, anyway. I've seen several reviewers call ISOYG an 'anti-rape' film or even a feminist statement, and I just have to chime in on the galling hypocrisy of these claims.First of all, what do we see on the cover of this movie? That's right: a shapely woman's behind. Whether it was Zarchi's attempt to make an anti-rape statement - and I absolutely don't believe it was - is entirely beside the point. The film is marketing sex and the titillation of sexual assault and the material is so graphic (everything but actual penetration is shown) that NO ONE but the hard core exploitation crowd will enjoy it.The rape(s) in the film is uncomfortable, brutal and hard to watch. There's something to be said for presenting a horrible crime in such a brutal light, but there was no reason for this scene to go on for seemingly 30 minutes, none. There was also little character development of the victim and only one of the rapists is slightly developed (mere moments before he's murdered) so the scene isn't at all engaging on an emotional level. Really, it's just presented for the sake of showing extreme sexual violence and you can tell by the movies ISOYG is associated with on IMDb (Caligula, Cannibal Ferox, etc.) that it attracts only the exploitation crowd.Finally, a few reviewers have commended Zarchi's so-called documentary style and lack of a soundtrack. But considering how inept everything else in the film is (acting, script, etc.) I suspect these were financial decisions and the film looks like a documentary because he literally stationed a camera and let his porn-caliber actors do their thing.I'm not going to get all up on my high horse talking about the content of ISOYG. I'm all for exploitation / horror and love video nasties. In fact, I'm giving this movie three stars only because it truly does push the envelope so much further than some other films. However, it's also poorly made and after the rape occurs, just downright boring for the rest of the film as we watch a bunch of ho-hum, mostly gore-less murders and wait for the credits to roll.This is probably worth watching once if you're a hardcore 70s exploitation fan but I'm telling you, the movie is overall pretty bad and not really worth its notorious reputation.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Theo Robertson is an idiot. This film is currently being remade staring Gillian Anderson....did anyone see the burning bed?? This film was made at the end of the 70's and the feminist movement was dead in the water. The sheer brutality of this film and the shaky camera work make it very real and very scary. I love the fact that she goes to the church and asks God for forgiveness for what she is about to do. This was a Tarantino movie before there were Tarantino movies. This film has merit in a Tarantino sort of way....wish he was directing it. The remake should be decent and anyone who rented this in the early 80's will probably enjoy it.

		<fullReview>An exploitation film with this caliber of appeal should have been awesome. It's a movie that's been banned in more than one country; that's already reason enough to expect something sensational. Revenge story? Awesome! But...Somewhere along the lines of absurd, this film was quite possibly the most boring exploitation picture of its time. For starters: The girl gets naked for no reason. Then the rape happens for no reason. And rape to me is a very gross, disturbing, and vile thing; but I Spit On Your Grave didn't even make me squirm, i found myself snacking on Cheerios during those scenes. The violence was equally idiotic as they didn't even save the best murder scene for last. If you think seeing a guy's feet getting chopped up is more disturbing than a guy's manhood being sliced off, then maybe you'll enjoy the revenge sequence: me, i didn't.basically, I Spit On Your Grave was over-hyped and stupid. it gets a 3 just for the fact that it inspired good movies to be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Day Of The Woman (Zero Stars)Consider Day Of The Woman the Chaos of it's time. Day Of The Woman was one of the first exploitation movies to exploit sexual abuse towards women and I have to say that this movie holds no punches. The rape scene is graphic and disturbing and yet I can't help it feel that the actors were enjoying it. The movie is on the revenge basis, the woman takes revenge on the men who raped her and she kills them in grueling ways which makes you wonder, is she the victim or are they the victims. A question that should be never asked in an exploitation film and if they do ask it, make sure the answer is answered in the right way and don't exploit it. I think it's rather an insult to define this movie as a horror film. To me it's a movie to watch if you want a reason to kill yourself and trust me, this movie gives a reason. This movie has found an audience but I'm not one of them and I don't want to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of critics dissed this film and that is very understandable if you are a movie chump. MOVIES ARE NOT REAL. So if a movie appalls you , isn't that a good thing. The rape scenes are raw with no score in the background and it feels like you are experiencing the mayhem. The main character goes from going on a peaceful getaway to a cold revenge mission. This movie shows rape in a disgusting way so it therefor makes rape look vile. It's an awesome revenge movie with a hot main character who slaughters these male pigs that many men in the world resemble. This is one of the best horror movies ever and is the blueprint for how to make an exploitation film!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Spit On Your Grave</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, I spit on your grave is a 1970's film that grabbed my attention simply because it hadn't been authorized for viewing in Australia until 2003 and now I can see why. I was interesting in viewing it to see why it couldn't be viewed, was it because of its violent and shocking storyline or the actual movie itself? This is actually one of the first films I have turned off half way through, it wasn't even memorable enough for me to remember the characters names. P.S., women will enjoy parts of this film but will also feel dirty by watching others. The story is of Jennifer(Camille Keaton)who lives in a small town as a writer and one day she is victim to a very long and violent rape and then left for dead, or is she? The rape scenes in this film are violent and disturbing (as they should be!) Men who watch this film note: if this turns you on you are sick and could use professional help. I would probably think different of this if it was based on a true story e.g. (Ted Bundy and Scum) then I could understand, a director wanting to study and direct a film like this to show realism of what it would be like if put in that situation but otherwise, no. Keaton does an exceptional job as "Jennifer" but the four men are just ugly, slack jawed yokel country guys who are looking for some fun, they portray characters who are not believable at all, there are several scenes where you think to yourself "that would never happen". As the film wore on a began to believe that it wasn't authorized to be viewed in Australia because we have better standards then that. If you have a sick and twisted mind and enjoy constant violence with no purpose or point, this is the film for you, otherwise chuck it into "another one of those 70's flicks bundles" under the ones not worth seeingPros Camille Keaton's ActingCons Everything about it</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me tell you that I'm a sucker for these types of movies. I love revenge-movies, I like when a movie pushing the limits, when I'm on the edge of my seat and when the director is brave enough to direct those "hard-to-watch"-scenes.The story of this flick is simple. The girl who just wants to be alone and write her own novel in a beautiful weekend-house, gets f*cked up pretty bad by some guy. 4 guys actually. Then, when she wakes up, starts plan her revenge. Pure and simple...The rape-scene in the beginning is pretty tough to watch I can say that. But that's what I like about the exploitation-movies. There is NO music in this film, not a damn soundtrack, and it makes the movie more intense and more frightening I think. The girl who played Jennifer Hill is done a great job, congratulations! After she gets raped and walking totally nude in the forest, dirty and bloody...Man...You can't see like that in today's Hollywood-movies. Jesus...Let's talk about the revenge. It's damn satisfying! Of course it's disturbing and brutal as hell, but satisfying when those prick gets what they deserves! I can highly recommend that movie for anyone who loves exploitation-films and revenge-flicks. It's truly an underrated classic bit of a genre. Diamond in a rough!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, it's not THAT raw, violent, or shocking. It hasn't decent production values or memorable scenes. It's bad fame or reputation is mostly made up because of it's title. The truth is that this is a regular almost mediocre rape-revenge flick. It's just among the bunch of 70's exploitation movies with the same temathic and formula. Sure, it's a very popular low budgeter but that doesn't means that it is worth watching. The plot is well known and it truly makes you wonder that it can happen to anyone in the same situation as the female lead character. She goes to the woods, in a specific cabin in order to complete her novel and have some rest. She wants internal peace. Suddenly, the worst of the nightmares begins for her. She is raped and humiliated by a trio of loonies. If this premise makes you feel uncomfortable, you should take a look at local police departments. Worst things happen. So our female heroine is devastated and probably traumatized. But she's a brave woman and decides to take revenge on her aggressors. Even against the retarded rapist. Well you can guess the outcome. This is the typical revenge flick where a woman is the arm of justice. Don't believe the hype for this movie. It isn't nasty, raw, or as violent as many people say. Even worse, this movie is advertised as the most shocking and violent movie ever made. Bull****. Also, I can't understand why with all the misogynistic campaign against it. Deal with it, it's only a movie. "I Stip On Your Grave" is a controversial movie just because it has an aggressive title and it features uncomfortable scenes. I would recommend it for people who enjoy the glory of the 70's exploitation. Other than that, it should be overlooked.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie when I was stationed in Germany in 1984. Well, to be perfectly frank, I walked in on a screening in the rec room. VHS was relatively new and my buddies were building their barracks-rat tape collections, so I didn't know who put it in the machine. I was weaned on horror and science fiction, so I should have picked up on the genre pretty quickly... If you ever want to screw with someone's head, rent this movie and fast-forward to the bathtub scene before you start showing it to friends (er, victims). It starts off by looking a bit like soft porn and ends with what may be the most disturbing and well-delivered off-shot dialog by a murder victim of all time (IMHO). Murder, even when committed as revenge, is still murder. Scary. Timeless. Twenty-plus years have passed and I still shudder when I recall this scene. Because the death is not shown (door gets closed and locked) we are treated to a radio-style theater of the mind. Wonderful device. Perfect application. Had I seen the flick from the beginning, I suspect I'd have known something was up and it wouldn't have had the same impact.

		<fullReview>**COMMENT CONTAINS SPOILERS AND A COMMENT OF AN ADULT NATURE**....Put's it out to be. I Spit on Your Grave is the story of Jennifer Hills, A New York magazine writer who goes to the countryside to complete her novel. On route there we get to see the first glance at the 4, depraved, retarded sick men, at the gas station. These are, Johnny, (Gangleader) Andy, (Goof) Stanley and Matthew...who just happens to be the local's retard of the countryside were she wen't to. The film start is very peaceful and quiet, actually I quite enjoyed the way the film started, it is just so natural and ambient. There is only seems to be Jennifer and her novel, but things do change. These 4 guys start to make it obvious as to there ambitions is. As we find out in the "Night Fishing" scene, what scum they really are. The whole goal of the movie is, supposedly, to get the retard, Matthew "lead". But I think Matthew isn't the worst out of the gang, you have to remember he is a retard, and the other guys did sort of bully him around. So when the guys have had enough of stalking, and fooling around at Jennifers house, they attack her when she is sun bathing in the boat.Johnny the "redneck" gangleader, tries to get Matthew to rape her first, but since Matthew can't and won't do it, as he seems to have some feelings for Jennifer, Johnny rips of her clothes as if she was a fox trapped in between a bear and a lion. And this is the start of the whole 20 some odd minute gang rape of this poor woman, I really felt sorry for her. After the first rape is finished, Jennifer is up through the woods only to find the guys had already planned the second attack, although we don't see it on screen. Andy then sodomizes her over a rock, this scene in particular is THE nastiest rape scene I have ever seen on a DVD, it is brutal. But don't get me wrong, I don't count this as exploitation, it doesn't show the rape scenes in a erotic fashion or sleazy close up camera angles. All of the sexual violence is brutal and not at all erotic....so much for Rodger Ebert's rubbish..."a film....for sex criminals". But soon after the gang rape is over, our hero Jenni recovers!. And Matthew, the goof, is the first to go, but why? I don't really know, cuz if this guy hadn't have been with the other guys he would have never have raped her.But he did, so I guess he deserved to die like them. And for our gang leader Johnny, well you know what happens to him (If you don't watch..), he gets what he fully needed!. All in all, I liked I Spit on Your Grave there I said it, and not for the so-called "exploitive bits" but for it's true horror of what a rape would be like, and the victim afterwords. So, if you think you can stomach the first 30 minutes, then buy it! But be warned the rape scenes are hard and brutal. I also love the Joe Bob Briggs commentary on the DVD, it is worth buying just to hear that alone, and of course the film.This comment applies to the uncut version.Unrated: Strong sexualised violence and sexualised assault, also contains strong language and Strong nudity. For over 18's only.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... as I Spit On Your Grave is the 100th movie I'm commenting on. And what a celebratory movie it is...Jennifer Hill takes a vacation from the big city and gets to the country to relax. But once there she meets up with 4 hillbillies Deliverance style who rape her and leave her for death. But somehow she survives and decides to kill her attackers one by one.Rape scenes are hard to take, in particular the final one. As Jennifer, already raped and beaten is finally back in her house, covered in mud, we see her reaching for the phone. While she dials the first number the phone is suddenly kicked away by the attackers, who apparently followed her home, and she gets raped again. This is so brutal... don't watch this movie if you're not up for it!Jennifer takes revenge on quite a disturbing way, luring the men with her sexuality and then killing them of, as this movie is highly offensive on some points.On the other hand, if you really want to see a 'sick' movie that was previously banned you probably should go for I Spit On Your Grave, as it really is a horror to watch it. But wasn't that exactly what the movie intended to do?6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, this movie is not and has never been a pro rape film. It is a story of a young woman who rents out a house in a secluded area of a small town, in order to write a novel. She is a woman who tends to herself and minds her own business. One day however, four men see her clad in a bikini and lying in her boat alone, and decide to drag her boat to land and rape her. They let her walk away and she proceeds to make her way home, walking completely nude through an unknown wood. The four men catch up to her and brutally rape her again while repeatedly slamming her head against a gigantic rock whenever she screams in pain. The men let her go again, watching her crawl on all fours covered in blood and dirt, back to her house. She attempts to call for help when they break into her house and persuade one of the four men who is a virgin and on the slow side, to rape her as well. After ridiculing and tearing up the pages of her unfinished novel, one of the men beat her by kicking and hitting her as if he was in a fight with another man. After all of these incidents is when the best part of the movie begins! The young writer goes on to plan and carry out the vicious murders of all four of these criminals, only in ways that they fully have asked for and deserve. For those of you who say "why should we root for her when she's no better?"....i say because it's JUSTICE! I say hail Jennifer Hill! I would do the same thing that she does, and for those of you who don't understand why, it's clearly obvious that you have no self respect for yourselves and are only a weakling that expects the government to take care of you, or you don't even accuse your attackers and become a victim afraid of men and life. This film is a lot more complex than what everyone makes it out to be, and unless you're a true woman or anyone who believes solely in justice, without letting your emotions and beliefs in religion get in the way, you will never be capable of understanding the message that this film translates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>this film is very much so, not for everyone, many will be grossed by the very graphic scenes of rape, and if you are, then this is most definitely not for you, push stop and watch another movie, probably one that isnt the only movie Roger Ebert actually said he hates. But, if your one of the sick freaks who can stand it, and may even be entertained by it, then come, join me in the freak pit where we will eat doritos and watch this along with other greats like Meet The Feebles, Dead Alive, and other such fare. :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Complete Masterpiece for its genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's amazing how ignorant some people can be. I Spit On Your Gave is a classic! This masterpiece is the ultimate story of revenge from a helpless (and ravaged) woman. The music is superb and not over-used like many Hollywood offerings. The rape scenes are extreme even to today's standards and only run about 15 minutes. There is a complete sense of justice when she completes her duties and anybody who couldn't feel this, I'd venture to say that they have a very sick spirit indeed. This innocent woman had nowhere to turn in this small town and took matters in her own hands, I say: good going! It's also amazing to see that most IMDB users who give this film a bad rating are also male (myself excluded), I wonder why? This is the message of the film, things never change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is the worst movie ever made. I hate when people say that about any movie, but I feel the term applies in this case.I don't object to the content of the movie, no matter how sick and sadistic it is. What's disturbing is the complete lack of artistry that went into the making of it; the rock-bottom production values and the total absence of a point or reason for being leave this sleazy movie on the same perverted level of a snuff film, and I don't see how anybody can defend any repugnant moment of it. The only reason to watch this grotesque exercise in depravity is to get off on watching a woman repeatedly raped, and whoever falls in this demographic is not somebody I want to know.The vilest thing about this movie is that the woman, by asking forgiveness from God, clearly premeditates the multiple murders she plans to carry out, making her no better than her assailants. We're supposed to root for her? What does this say about the morals of this character, and of the filmmakers for that matter?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possibly the worst film I've ever seen, or at least the most irredeemably ludicrous</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For quite a while, Manos: The Hands of Fate has been my pick for the worst filmever made. It's a total work of shoddy hack dubbed over by three voices and directed by a fertilizer salesman. Somehow though, I Spit on Your Grave, aka Day of the Woman, with its budget maybe a few thousand more, is still just as god-awful, and in its own way is worse because it's not really memorable aside from its faults. I may be able to quote Torgo for years to come, but there's nothing of value even for tongue-in-cheek references in Meir Zarchi's film- or rather, cinematic Eraserhead baby- and is such a colossal waste that one feels brain cells rapidly drop as it hurdles into its "third act", if there is one. And what's even more offensive is that Zarchi and his actors, if one could call them that, don't even accomplish the wretched exploitation goals they set out to do.People may seek out I Spit on Your Grave for more wicked though personal reasons (eg, this is for the most part half rape porn and half woman revenge massacre flick), but even on these ends its so stupidly put together; a scene of rape in the woods, for example, should be easy enough to put together, yet it's all for not, with the intended realism coming off like, well, I can't even describe it (is it the locomotion or an ass-f***, pick one and stick with it). And the killings are, even for a no-budget exploitation flick of the 70s way too illogical on a bad movie level. Yeah, yeah, it's supposed to be sensationalism, not exactly entertainment. But where the hell is the sensationalizing? Scenes involving a castration - the lead up to this, by the way, may be one of the dumbest in all movie history - it's not fun this time to yell at the screen, but rather the feeling kicks in to smash your own head into a mirror over the idiocy presented, two lake killings, and the aforementioned forty-five minute long rape, go on an on, soon fizzling out and then lacking out on the delivery. And the one guy playing the retarded man even has a scene where he goes "method" with a bag of groceries!I seem to have neglected mentioning the plot. There isn't any. As with a porn- come to think of it, some pornos go for more than this, as cheesy as they can get- story isn't the case so much as situation, and whatever half-assed attempts there are to make characterizations in scenes of dialog are obfuscated by the sound being so horribly recorded. Particularly with Camille Keaton the sound level on a perfectly capable stereo is almost non-existent a lot of the time (maybe most hilarious is seeing her read out as she's writing her 'novel', reminiscent of Woody Allen writing out TS Eliot in Love and Death). It's actually abhorrent to realize then that the recent DVD release of the film was remastered in THX! Is Lucasfilm running out of titles to remaster? As the movie goes along through the motions, and becomes more and more and more illogical and just plain stupid, it becomes an endurance trial, less enjoying in a guilty-pleasure way the results, of how far Zarchi can go in trying to hide how contemptible, vacuous and plain sloppy whatever script they had while shooting this.So could I recommend the movie even to the most hard-pressed connoisseurs of B to Z grade movie-making of the 70s? Maybe as a cruel joke, perhaps, but not in any serious capacity. My inclination would actually be to use the DVD as skeet shooting practice, only it is from Netflix and feel some responsibility for going into such an act like putting it on my queue in the first place. As a filmmaker myself, the only service it serves is to make very clear what to never, ever, ever do under any circumstances. And above all else, what I Spit on Your Grave is, aside from being obnoxious in its "hey, this is like Last House on the Left reality" style and ultra crude in its bad horror movie way, it's often quite boring. Manos was as well, but at least it was a laughable form of boredom. Much of this massively over-hyped experiment in schlock is too dull to reach to its own lurid ambitions. Indeed, if it weren't for my own ironic reaction during the end credits- singing the song "Chick Habit" from Death Proof to myself- this would be the worst movie-viewing experience in quite a number of years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I spit on this movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Due to the controversy of a motion picture of violence at it's highest, I Spit On Your Grave is the most, harshest, trashy and unbelievable movie that I ever saw. The movie's tone is not good and the actors have some very bad lines that some don't act good when their line are spoken. About where the movie does gets bloody, I thought that the movie is turning into a feminist film. With this raging woman, hell-bent on violence and killing men remorseless, I find this movie very offensive and brutal. The movie story of I Spit on Your Grave tells the story of an female writer, who goes out to the country to find peace. Instead, she finds out that five men are harassing such as, raping her and viciously mauling her. Then, the woman writer turns to her victims of destruction. She becomes a killer, make that, a really vicious killer. Her vengeance in the movie is one of the most shocking things I've seen. There is one scene where the woman killer kills a man in the bathtub and the woman said a inappropriate piece of dialogue. She said, "Relax. Wait till you feel this." After that, she murdered him by stabbing him in the genitals. I find this movie very cruel and brutal to watch. It is a glorification of violence toward women. I Spit on Your Grave is a disgrace to cinema. Zero Stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rape and simple yet sloppy revenge flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically a rape and revenge flick. Now I can tell why some people would despise this flick and some people would find it kinda engrossing. Anyways there really isn't much to say about the plot, a girl gets raped and the rape victim is Jennifer Hills played by Camille Keaton who did a excellent job playing the victim. She really did put in a lot of effort and put on a believable performance. Anyways she gets raped and tries to get her revenge in a calm manner. Now this is one of those movies that tries to shock you and it's does accomplish what it tries to do, but besides that this is basically a exploitation film that has nothing really artsy about it. Now some women that watch this may get a picked off, but I found it to be kinda pro-woman. This ain't really a horror film, but has to do with horrific people, if it had some suspense or tense moments it would have made the film somewhat, but that isn't the case. It just comes down to a rape and sloppy revenge flick nothing more and yet it's somewhat engrossing. I know many people will look for many reasons to hate on a film like this, but after all it's only a movie and nothing more. If your in the mood to see something cruel and a bit brutal or disturbing, than this movie won't be so bad. The scenes where the victim acts like she enjoyed the rape in order to lure the culprits, was a bit satisfying.4.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton from "What Have you done to Solange?) is a write who travels to the countryside to finish her novel in peace and quiet. But some local boys have quite different plans for Miz Hill. Who terrorize, then rape her repeatedly. Trying to take solace in her rented house, she's attacked again causing her mind to snap, sending her on a killing frenzy.Pure exploitation plain and simple. These people who say this film is about "female empowerment" are just talking out of their asses. Others who complain that this is ultra-repulsive and vile are simply prude, as "Deliverance" is VASTLY much more upsetting. "Ms. 45" now THAT film is vile. This is far from the worst movie ever made and is a bit better than "Last House on the Left" actually. You have to give props to any low budget independent film that's still talked about and debated on nearly 30 years after it was made. And as far as rape/revenge films go, this is in the top echelon of them.My Grade: B- DVD Extras: Uncut; Commentary by Joe Bob Briggs (the main reason I bought this), second commentary by director Meir Zarchi; Poster gallery; Reviews &amp; articles; Cast &amp; crew Bios; 3 Radio Spots; 3 TV spots; and 4 Theatrical Trailers (including the Red-band one, &amp; one in Spanish) Easter Egg: Highlight the word 'Grave' in the main menu for 4 behind the scenes stills</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At last its nothing, but a rape and revenge flick.So what makes me watch this movie or why any critic or intelligent persona will waste his/her time on this title when there are so much quality flicks still there?Well,I may have the answer for that!!First thing that may attract you towards this movie is its title"I spit on your grave",(though it is also known as"Day of women"),at least in mine case it was the title of the movie,which appears to me quite strange rather 'offensive',I would say.Once started with the movie,you should enjoy it as Camilla Keaton looked quite sexy in skimpy clothes.Jennifer is a writer who took break from the city life to write her first novel,in quite an isolated place where she could avoid being disturbed or inter fared.But what happens is she got brutally raped by four local muggers.Well rape scene was quite long and disturbing.And then follows her sadistic 'revenge'.In a scene,a guy told Jennifer that she was like a bait and certainly I don't disagree with him.Don't hate me for that,but any one can take a chance if one can find lonely half-naked,sexy girl around....Well,whatever but this movie should be given a try.I remembered,at that time I also watched Abel Ferrara's Ms.45 which is based on same subject but it fails to impress me.So if you have to watch a movie on such topic,then go for Day of woman.At the same time I would say there is nothing new in it,its being another sexploitive movie......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't bother with it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, I'd like to say that movies are one of the biggest passions in my life. I enjoy watching movies of every genre, from any era and don't really prefer any genre over the other, just as long as a movie has something to offer. I never tend to read too much into exaggerated bashing or the hypes surrounding some movies. So given that I guess it's needles to say that I approach every movie with an open mind. Which is why I like to give movies with a bad reputation, such as I.S.O.Y.G., the benefit of a doubt and find out for myself rather than just simply taking someone's word for it. (There's no point in being a puppet people :D). So that's what I did with this movie in an orderly fashion.However if you are a person that make up your mind wither or not to watch a movie, by reading reviews I will help you out by saying this: Watching this movie is as close to a waste of time that I personally have ever gotten! And there is a big chance you will feel the same way if you decide to watch it."Waste of time" Now there's an expression I don't really like to use, but watching it basically was. The only thing I gained from watching this travesty of a movie, was the privilege of sharing my opinion on it afterward. That's it. While watching I mostly just wanted it to be over, since I was bored out of my mind, and now I have to get this off my chest. In my opinion 'I Spit On Your Grave' lacks in EVERY single aspect of film-making. It's by far the worst movie I've ever seen, and here are the main reasons why:1. The direction was awful! Nearly all the scenes dragged without any real point to them, the movie was about 100 minutes when all of it could have been over in about 40 minutes 2. The plot sucked! (Just because rape is an awful and degrading thing, doesn't make this a great movie). 3. The characters were simple minded and plain out boring. Very badly written, without any dimensions at all. (None of them evoked anything that even resembles an emotion) 4. The actors pretty much sucked too, especially Camille Keaton who didn't contribute anything with her poor acting. (But then again not even a talented actress could have saved this train wreck of a movie) And finally as for the ones that say it's disturbing, I honestly didn't find it disturbing at all, simply because it was too badly made on all accounts to actually evoke emotions or make one feel anything other than bored. Already after about 15-20 minutes it was obvious to me that this movie never really would take off. I'm not against a movie being slow paced, or made with simple means (with a low budget), in fact I welcome it, since I like movies that keep you thinking and sometimes require you to be patient. Movies that for example focus and rely much on dialog, face expressions or images in order to make you think or feel something, but again there has to be a point to it, and everything about this particular movie was just amateurish all over. Don't be fooled by people trying to make this movie out to be a masterpiece. It isn't. You could most likely do better yourself given a camera. And I really mean that.In conclusion, this movie is pointless!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jennifer (Camille Keaton), a beautiful magazine author from New York, leaves the hustle and bustle of the big city to spend her summer in the country, where she intends to write her first novel. Unfortunately, she soon attracts the attention of a group of four local louts, who abduct the poor woman and proceed to gang-rape her, eventually leaving her for dead.Of course, Jennifer is still alive and kicking, and after spending a couple of weeks in hiding, recovering from her ordeal, she sets out to even the score with her attackers.One of the most notorious titles on the official BBFC 'Nasties' list, I Spit On Your Grave (AKA Day of the Woman) is a relentlessly harsh movie that refuses to shy away from showing the absolute horror of rape AND revenge. Director Meir Zarchi unflinchingly shows his audience every nasty detail of Jennifer's attack, and then calmly and dispassionately depicts every lurid moment of her calculated and methodical acts of violence.The matter-of-fact manner in which all four rapists are dispatched go to make the film extremely shocking stuff?much more so than if Zarchi had sensationalised Jennifers's revenge. Keaton doesn't go all Rambo on her attackers, by making traps and hunting her prey; she doesn't don a leather catsuit and equip herself with crossbows and flamethrowers. She just watches (even as one of the men spends time with his wife and children), waits, and then makes her move when ready.I don't think the audience is supposed to condone her decision to kill, try to understand her train of thought, or even enjoy her acts of retribution. All we can do is watch as she systematically kills each man, and then decide for ourselves whether she is justified in her actions.Technically, the film could be a lot better?in particular, some scenes meander rather aimlessly for far too long?but as a piece of ugly, gritty, and powerful exploitation movie-making, I Spit On Your Grave is extremely effective stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A vicious attack on male character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I find it interesting that this movie was decried on the basis that it was promoting violence against women. The depiction of every single major male character in this film presented them as violent, menacing, morally bankrupt, impotent, aggressive, and even murderous. This movie did not glorify violence against women. Rather, it leveraged the depiction of female victimization in order to glorify revenge against men. Feminist righteous indignation against men, combined with a latent disgust for masculinity, were all the justification needed in order to depict the men in this film in such base terms.You want a reason to dislike this film? Dislike it for its demonization of men, and its exploitation of the very real pain of rape simply to achieve a political goal. The purpose of the film was to shame and marginalize the male gender, pure and simple.More about how rape has been leveraged by radical gender feminists for political and societal gain: http://www.leaderu.com/real/ri9502/sommers.htmlJohn Dias Founder, DontMakeHerMad.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a really good movie on the whole.I can't understand why anyone who actually saw this would think it glorifies rape. Instead it shows in the starkest detail that rape is about violence and humiliation and not about sex. The rape scenes are harrowing and hard to watch but I've heard cops say that if film and TV showed violence realistically instead of sugarcoating it they would encourage less real violence. Well, no one can accuse this movie of sparing any brutal details but it does feel realistic and not gratuitous; I can imagine a real rape might be something like this. Keaton does a fairly good job of acting here. The male rapists are a bit over the top and stereotyped but that just helps you hate them more. At the end I was cheering the woman on and hoping the male "victims" would die as painfully as possible. That is an interesting switch from normal movie plots.In summary, this isn't for the squeamish and is a very harrowing movie to watch but it makes a very important and powerful point and is on the whole well done. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Classic Rape/Revenge Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is definitely one of the quintessential rape/revenge films of all time - and definitely one of the best. Short version: woman goes to a secluded cabin in the woods to get some writing and vacationing done. She is accosted and raped several times by some local rednecks, then exacts bloody revenge on them. This is pretty much the same basic storyline as many rape/revenge films, and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is one of the best of the genre. The movie is shot and acted well, and there is no music score which adds to the realism. The rape sequences are appropriately brutal, as are the revenge scenes - one in particular that will have every male in attendance squirming... I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE is a classic film, very well done and still powerful even compared to more contemporary films. The subject matter and brutality of the film overall will keep some viewers away - those who are more daring should definitely check this one out. If you like this, see also the legendary LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT, the semi-pornographic "shocker" BAISE MOI, the European classic THRILLER: A CRUEL PICTURE, and for the truly brave - the Hong Kong masterpiece RED TO KILL. 9/10 for I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE - Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrific and poorly made yet strangely intriguing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warning: ?I Spit on Your Grave' contains extremely violent and offensive subject matter including sexual assault. This review contains occasional explicit references to such acts. Meir Zarchi's controversial shocker ?I Spit on Your Grave' is possibly one of the foulest horror films ever to be made. The movie follows the story of Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton), a pretty young writer who travels out to a remote country cabin to work on her novel. Unfortunately for Jennifer she is subjected to a horrific rape by three rednecks and a retarded delivery boy. After being raped and sodomised over a rock she manages to crawl her way home only to suffer another horrendous attack by the same gang. Miraculously recovering from her ordeal Jennifer sets out to gain a bloody and sickening revenge.This was the first of only two horror movies to be directed by Meir Zarchi and it isn't hard to understand why there were no more. ?I Spit on Your Grave' holds no artistic merit at all with its inadequate direction and poor production so it is understandably often labelled as utter trash. I am yet to come across a movie with a more horrific and prolonged rape scene. Surprisingly the rape scene was somewhat of an accomplishment for Zarchi. Rather than have a ten minute scene Zarchi drops the viewer straight into hell with a vile and degrading thirty minute sequence. Never before has the total brutality of rape been so well portrayed on film and the sequence succeeds in making the viewer loathe those that have wronged Jennifer. This attack is so painful to watch that the grisly revenge that Jennifer takes on her attackers pales in comparison. ?I Spit on Your Grave' is little short of an endurance test for the viewer.Unfortunately Zarchi's screenplay for ?I Spit on Your Grave' is borderline garbage. Featuring some of the most pointless dialogue and character interaction the film strains the lines of credibility and becomes very hard to stay focused on when there are no `action' sequences. The acting is just as atrocious; even from Camille Keaton who is pretty much the only performer from ?I Spit on Your Grave' to ever appear in another movie. Nevertheless, despite all the flaws there is something strangely intriguing about ?I Spit on Your Grave' and while I would not say it is a film I enjoy watching I will say that I don't hate it. There are some inventive (and horrifying) kills and the final scene has a disturbing tranquillity about it.Due to the virtually non-existant production values it is easy to label ?I Spit on Your Grave' as sick rubbish or an awful film but there is more to this movie than rape and revenge. Although the screenplay severely lacks in good dialogue and interesting parts there are a couple of interesting scenes that can make the viewer question certain aspects of the story and characters in a positive way. However, I think the majority of people will see few redeemable features in this movie and should probably avoid watching it. Fans of 70's exploitation flicks like ?Last House on the Left' (1972) and ?Cannibal Holocaust' (1979) may enjoy this but I'm almost certain the average viewer (inclusive of horror fans) will not. My rating for ?I Spit on Your Grave' ? 5.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Problem, this films makes out that Rape is worse than Murder . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem with this junkie movie is that it tries to make the statement that a rape is worse than a murder. I do not care what little, feminist group out there wants to irrationally scream that it is - No, it is not! It absolutely is not and never will be. It may be because statistics show that more men are murdered than women or die violent deaths, so, of course, women of this mentality completely don't care or understand. Sexism much??? The vast majority of this movie is so freaking boring!!! It almost seems as though they separated the rape scenes out and kept the camera rolling, while she did nothing but walk, just to give this weak story a feature length. Bad acting, horrible lighting, unbelievable portrayal of men . . . This movie just plain stinks all over the place. The only reason it made money was because of the controversy and bad mouthing of this, which the director proudly admits. I somehow really question how this piece of crap is some kind of empowerment for women . . . Yes, rape is bad, but call the police! It is also severely unrealistic how after the rapes, she goes back around to them and they don't wonder what's up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Spit on Your Grave (1978) *** (out of 4) Vile and notorious shocker about a female writer (Camille Keaton) from NY who goes to the country for a vacation only to be gang raped by four men. After recovering from her injuries the woman goes out to seek revenge against the men. This is probably the most controversial movie ever made and the 23-minute rape scene has a large part to do with that but in my opinion this film has been mistreated for many years now. The controversy really hit full speed when Siskel and Ebert got this pulled from Chicago theaters as well as getting it pulled from cities across the country. Ebert would go on to call this the worst film ever made but I guess the two didn't realize that because of them this would become one of the biggest cult films ever made. There's no doubt the film is vile and disgusting but the director wanted to show the effects of rape. The violence in the second half is over the top and brutal but again, I personally feel the director wanted the men to feel as much pain as the woman did and this included a graphically violent scene where one of the men gets his penis cut off. You certainly won't forget this scene. The film is extremely well made and the director made a nice choice by not adding a music score. The performances are also very good, especially Keaton who is the granddaughter of Buster. A hard film to watch but one that gets better with each viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How can a 'film' such as this get made? Total crap from beginning to end.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Day of the Woman, or it's much more common alternate title of I Spit on your Grave, starts in New York as a writer named Jennifer Hill (Camille Keaton, who is apparently the Grand-niece of Buster Keaton &amp; one time wife of this film's director Mier Zarchi ) sets off by car for the peace &amp; tranquillity of the Connecticut countryside, it's not actually mentioned during the film but that's where Day of the Woman was shot in reality. Jennifer has rented a summerhouse next to a river so she can concentrate on writing her first full novel. As Jennifer stops for Gas &amp; to ask directions she meets Johnny (Eron Tabor) &amp; two of his friends Andy (Gunter Kleemann) &amp; Stanley (Anthony Nichols) who are both playing a game involving a knife called Mumbleypeg, apparently anyway. Once Jennifer finds her summerhouse she has a visit from a slightly retarded delivery boy named Matthew Lucas (Richard Pace) who drops off some groceries &amp; introduces himself. While out fishing one night Johnny, Stanley &amp; Andy discover that Matthew is a virgin &amp; that he fancies Jennifer. They decide to give Jennifer to Matthew so they corner Jennifer in the woods where they force her to the ground, rip her clothes off &amp; tell Matthew to get on with it. Matthew refuses so Johnny not wanting to waste an opportunity has his way with Jennifer, what happens next is that Andy, Stanley &amp; eventually Matthew all mercilessly rape &amp; beat Jennifer. Johnny tells Matthew to go back &amp; kill Jennifer but he can't do it &amp; lets her live which may turn out to be the last mistake they ever make...Co-produced, written &amp; directed by Meir Zarchi Day of the Woman is a real travesty of cinema. I simply cannot understand how anyone can obtain any kind of viewing pleasure or entertainment from such an ugly, boring, exploitative &amp; cheap film. The script has no characterisation whatsoever, no one is developed beyond their names apart from Johnny who is given a wife (Alexis MMagnotti) &amp; two young children (Tammy &amp; Terry Zarchi, the director's children perhaps?) &amp; that's it. Jennifer never interacts with anyone other than the rapists &amp; they never interact with anyone other than Jennifer. Day of the Woman is incredibly dull &amp; boring with bags of 'dead' running time &amp; padding, constant shots of people walking or driving around &amp; scenes which go on forever because Zarchi likes to keep the shot going even if nothing significant is happening. There are no other plot threads either to help alleviate the tedium, Day of the Woman is definitely a one note film. The rape sequences are about as fun to watch as you can imagine, again I simply don't understand how someone can gain entertainment from seeing a woman beaten &amp; gang raped for about thirty minutes straight, I just don't. The revenge part of the film is mediocre at best, apart from the castration scene the methods of disposal are as bland &amp; forgettable as the rest of this sorry excuse for a film &amp; I felt Keaton's performance during this final part of the film was somewhat unconvincing &amp; a little up &amp; down, one moment she's having sex or masturbating one of the guy's that brutally raped &amp; beat her the next she's coolly &amp; calmly killing them. There's next to no gore, just some blood when Jennifer castrates the guy &amp; he bleeds to death. There is however, obviously, plenty of female nudity. Day of the Woman contains no music at all which seems quite strange while watching it, the photography credited to Yuri Haviv is extremely basic &amp; stodgy, the film overall fails to generate any really memorable atmosphere or tension &amp; definitely isn't scary or thought provoking as some would try &amp; have you believe. Day of the Woman appears to have been shot entirely on location &amp; together with the basic production values &amp; photography it has a certain realism that I found lessened the viewing experience even more. The acting is OK everything considered but I didn't like or have any sympathy for anyone, not even Keaton. Overall I have no liking for Day of the Woman whatsoever, it's dull, boring, cheap &amp; nasty all in one unappealing overlong 100 odd minute package. I think maybe people want to like it because of it's notoriety &amp; feel they have to, almost as if they feel they've watched something 'special' somehow. I personally found nothing enjoyable about Day of the Woman but I will concede that it has a certain exploitative feel to it plus the acting &amp; locations are OK, not much of a recommendation really &amp; it wasn't meant to be. There are far too many better films out there to be wasting your time with this film which belongs in the gutter from where it came, maybe one to avoid.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gross, even for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vile and reprehensible. Completely lacking artistic value. Multiple rape scenes each more violent and graphic from the one before. And just when you think it's going to get good it fails to deliver but instead tries to expand the lead characters psychosis and develop her into a psychotic killer; The hunted has become the hunter! And even though my reviews are known primarily on the reviews of how much T&amp;A and nudity a movie brings I refuse to acknowledge any sexuality of this movie. I sat watching this movie with vomit in the back of my throat waiting to erupt the whole time. This movies plot had lots of potential but destroyed it with graphic scenes of brutality and lack of vengeance I wanted to see at the end of the movie. Watch only if Rotten.com is unavailable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A disturbing look at rape, the mindset of men who commit it and the justification of brutal revenge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The rape is horrific, each time you think they're are letting her go, only to return. The anal rape is chilling, with unbearably realistic agonised screams.The eventual revenge is not portrayed as entirely justified. One man turns out to have a family. The mentally challenged guy is confirmed as being pretty child-minded. And the revenge dealer chooses methods of killing that are vindictive ? rather than just shooting them.The lack of music in the film gives everything a more realistic edge and also serves to accentuate the parts that do have music. After a truly amazing castration scene the lead calmly collects her bathrobe, locks her victim in the bathroom and waits for his pleading to end while listening to opera in her armchair. As well as my (male) horror at the dialogue from the guy who just lost his dong, all I could think was, is this really justified? Do I still approve of the main character's coolly calculated revenge?I love a bit of moral dilemma.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite in the rape/revenge category</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you have never seen a rape/revenge film before, then let me tell you how it works. The plot is really easy. It's simply just about an innocent woman that loses her innocence by a group of rapists. Her life gets ruined and crushed. So she can never live with herself again, unless she kills the perpetrators. After her revenge, she can start her new life. The theme and subject around the genre is about how egoistic, cruel and assholes men can be. It's also about woman's being independent and taking care of business for them selves. Another title for this movie is actually "Day of the Woman". I think that speaks for itself.This has to be the best of the rape/revenge films. Probably one of the most controversial movies out in the 70's. And there's a good reason for it too. The rape scenes are really brutal and strong to watch. There's hardly any music in it, and all of the cruel scenes are all really long so it all seem really realistic. There's nothing left to your own imaginations. They show everything in the rape-scenes. It's really graphic and disturbing. Call me sick, but I loved it! There's also some gore scenes as well. But there aren't buckets of blood, splattering body parts or anything. It's not that kind of a movie. Be sure not to get the UK version of this epic. The English version is so heavily cut that you won't even understand what's going on.If you enjoyed the Swedish "Triller en grym film" then you will certainly find this very interesting as well. They're very similar, but I like the way "I spit on your grave" build up the plot better. You get to know the characters allot better. You even get a little sympathy for some of those who raped her. So it defiantly has a more realistic view. It's not like most exploitation or trash cinema. It is very professional and it sure doesn't fool around. All scenes are beautifully filmed and cinematography is great. I loved the locations and sets. I can't understand why this has gotten such a trash exploitation status. This is great stuff.But there is some stuff about this film that seems a bit unreliable. But you shouldn't really pay attention to those minor details. There's not much bad to tell you about this film really. It's almost perfect. But there is this one thing that drives me nuts about the plot. Not all of the characters really deserved to die. There's this handicapped person that gets killed. And the guy didn't deserve that at all. It really upsets me. I won't spoil how and why, but watch the movie for yourself. You will probably understand what I mean.If you're a very impatient person that's only out for the gore and blood in this film then don't watch it. A lot of the scenes are slow, and everything happens in just a few shots. Rape/revenge is not a particularly gory genre, but still...I really recommend it to anyone else. You shouldn't miss this one out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Cool rape revenge movie. Here is a lesson for those who thinks its OK to rape women and think that they will get away with it. A group of young men decide to attack and rape and young and attractive new women in town. They gang rape her and leave her for dead. (The movie is slightly slow up to there). When the women recovers from the ordeal is seeks the men out to take her hideous revenge on them. In this movie you see loads of violence and sexual scenes, which for the 70s you could understand why the censors banned the movie in some parts of the world. I am a huge horror fan and am hard to please in movies but this movie almost makes it to one of my favorites. You see several scenes of the women walking around stark naked ( seeing everything mind you) . All the murders are savage but the best murder of all is a the half wit in the movie ( who really didn't seem to want to rape her in the first place). If you haven't seen this flick I suggest you need to hire it especially if you are after heaps of gore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film makers left nothing to your imagination in "I Spit On Your Grave" or "Day of the Woman". All women who have been raped and violated do not need to see a film which dwells completely with sick animals(not human beings) who pick on and try to distroy a human being. The entire film needed to find itself on the cutting room floor. Poor excuse for a film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>According to self-acclaimed genius Roger Ebert, this is ? and I quote ? `The worst movie ever made'?Yeah well, what the hell does he know? Perhaps it was a little rough for him, but yours truly really thinks it's an essential and important motion picture. NOT exclusively made for bizarre and perverted horror fans, but a thought-provoking and shocking portrayal of the darkest side of society and the most morbid aspects of human behavior in particular. The story of a young woman that seeks deadly revenge for the men who brutally raped her like animals is a lot more than just a series of nasty horror sequences! It's drama, sentiment and a deep psychological portrait. Even though ?I spit on your Grave' owes a lot ? probably even its whole existence ? to Last House on the Left, it surpasses Craven's film when it comes to the most important aspects like raw footage, connection with the main character and shocking realism. Several scenes in this film are really hard to digest, but so are some of the headlines in the daily news and we're confronted with that as well. The message in ?I spit on your Grave' will hopefully leave behind a bigger impression on you that the average SciFi flick in which stupid looking aliens fight each other with light-sables.I was astonished about the production values of this low-budget shocker. I would have expected it to be really amateurish and uninspired, but the film is shot surprisingly professional and creative. It even contains suspenseful scenes and the depressing atmosphere is terrifically build up. All this makes it even harder to accept that so many people loath this film and bash it into the ground. Why? I really don't see what's so abominable about it! In my book, it's a classic and it should be respected and treated like one. End of discussion?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The term most commonly used for a film such as this would be "video nasty", as it got little cinema release recognition, and got a much bigger audience when released to video, I had to see if it was as nasty as it sounded. Basically attractive New York short story writer Jennifer Hills (Camille Keaton) has rented an isolated riverside cabin outside of the city to start work on her new novel. Soon after she arrives she has attracted the attention of many male locals, including gas station manager Johnny (Eron Tabor), unemployed youths Stanley (Anthony Nichols) and Andy (Gunter Kleemann) and shy and slightly mentally retarded grocery delivery man Matthew Lucas (Richard Pace). One day the four men seize their opportunity to help Matthew lose his virginity by grabbing Jennifer, stripping her clothes off, and the village idiot Matthew refuses to have his way with her. So Johnny rapes her, then Andy has his turn anally, and then Matthew finally gives in, but can't orgasm, so Stanley ends it with a quick sexual assault. They were originally going to leave her in her faint bloody state, but Johnny knows they could be caught so he tells Matthew to stab her to death, but he can't, so he covers the knife in some of her blood and claims he did it. After recovering, and finding out her novel has been ruined as well, she goes to church to ask for forgiveness, as she plans a deadly revenge for the four degenerates. Knowing he will deliver groceries to her door, Jennifer orders some for Matthew to drop off, and she seduces him to have sex with her under a tree next to the river, where she he puts neck in a noose, hangs him, and drops his body in the water. Next to face her wrath is Johnny, who she tempts into her car, stopping on the way to the cottage with a gun and ordering him to remove his clothes, but he tempts to lower the gun. She invites Johnny back to the house for a hot bath, with her of course, and when he mentions Matthew is missing, he thinks she is joking when she says she killed him, and then he has his genitals mauled in the bath. After Johhny dies from blood loss, Jennifer dumps his body in the basement, and she burns his clothes, we see Stanley and Andy know that Johnny has gone missing. They take their motorboat to the cabin house, taking an axe with them, and after some failed attacks with it, Jennifer takes the boat, plunges the axe into Andy's back in the water, and mashes Stanley with the boat propeller. This film has the alternative title Day of the Woman, but the more catchy title gets all the attention, and there are some gory moments, so while the acting is cheesy, and the blood amount is small, it isn't such a bad horror thriller. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly The Worst Film I`ve Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can remember everyone talking about this from the early 80s when just about every home in Britain had either rented or bought the new home entertainment essential called a video recorder and my teenage peers and myself would discuss what videos we`d seen and I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE was the one everybody was talking about . If you hadn`t seen it you`d heard about it due to its reputation of ultra graphic violence but the film was banned before I managed to see it .It was only last year I saw it for the first time when it was released on DVD with several minutes of rape scenes cut . But even then this film churned my stomach , it`s just about the most pitiful excuse of a film it`s been my displeasure to watch . Absolutely everything is awful , the acting , the directing , the cinematography , the sound , but most of all there is no intelligent story here . I know there is a school of thought that this film has intellectual content on its themes of rape and revenge - yeah right . If that`s the case then why does I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE spend so much time on the rape and murder scenes ? And why does it have a " comedy " character in the shape of the dim witted rapist ? Yup nothing like a little comic relief in amongst the gang rapes and mutilations . It`s a bit like saying EXTERMINATOR 2 is a masterpiece of urban angst .I don`t normally award a film on this site with a 1 but I did with this film. It`s a pity we can`t give films a minus mark</fullReview>
