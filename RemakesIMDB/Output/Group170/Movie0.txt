		<shortDescription>Hypnotic, violent classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Was wondering why they don't make films like this anymore. Then it dawned on me. It has ambiguous morals and doesn't particularly ask for or seek redemption. The hero is a killer and bank robber, he says little and therefore you should have to work hard to empathize with him. But it comes easy because everyone else around Doc McCoy is ten times worse than he is. And Doc is played by Steve McQueen. A magnificent brooding presence who's character doesn't stop to question his actions, because if he did he'd die or get arrested. And this is where it is so much better than a contemporary film of the same vein. It's not made with actors who are scared that their image might be tarnished or misunderstood, it is not made by film-makers who are scared they might upset someone, it is not made by people who particularly need to be loved. So what you get is a story that rings true, a piece of fiction that at no time stops to apologize for itself. It grabs you, says this is what I am, and if you're hooked then great. If not go and watch Bambi or something.A bona fide classic piece of storytelling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who needs Baldwin/Basinger when you've got McQueen/McGraw??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve McQueen was one of the most naturally talented actors to come along, and this movie, along with 'The Sand Pebbles', is one of my favorite McQueen movies. Ali McGraw is excellent (much better here, as compared to that sappy role she had in 'Love Story') as his on-screen wife, a team which is used to rob a bank but is double crossed by the insiders who stand to profit from the robbery. Sally Struthers even turns in a credible performance as someone exhibiting what will later be coined as the "Stockholm Syndrome", and the late Al Lettieri is great as one of their pursuers.A far better movie than the 1994 remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a true masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I consider "The getaway" a true masterpiece, on the same level of Sam Peckinpah's major achievements (save "The wild bunch", of course). I learn from IMDb comments that the final cut of the movie was made by other people (McQueen ?!) than the director. Moreover the plot is much unfaithful to the original novel... Well... anyway the result is excellent.Doc (Steve McQueen) is a tough, laconic guy, Carol (Ali McGraw) a tough, laconic woman. In some sense, they mostly speak just for technical reasons: "Take the money-bag", "Don't scratch your wound"... If they've nothing to say, they keep quiet. They seem shy to express their reciprocal feelings, even unable to say "I love you". Doc cannot accept what Carol has done, although just to help him out of jail. They both silently suffer for this, with some explosions of violence by Doc, and a ready gritty reply by Carol. But the audience well understand from their body-language how much they love each other. I think that McQueen and McGraw made a superb job in their difficult roles. Strangely enough, their performances, as well as their lines, received much criticism. I fear that people didn't like their job since they are too used to the current way of acting: hysterical, screaming, awfully clown-like. With lines that are just floods of stupid, pointless, annoying chats. A not welcome legacy of the style created by Tarantino, Oliver Stone and imitators. Nothing could be more far-away from Peckinpah's artistic taste.The story of the movie is linear, but not trivial. The cinematography and montage are outstanding. The pace is somewhat slow, partially due to the great care paid to details. But when it's the time of action, nobody can compete with Peckinpah's grand style.In every movie of his, Peckinpah shows his genius with some astonishing, stark new cinematic ideas. In "The getaway" we find the paramount representation of the "power of the shot-gun". Doc's shot-gun bullets destroy police-cars, devastate a whole hotel, demolish an elevator, knock down a door slaughtering the thug hidden behind... the recoil of the weapon lifts Doc's shoulder... Who remembers that this stuff, nowadays almost a cliche in action-movies, was introduced in "The getaway"? It's worth noting that an early imitator of Peckinpah's "shot-gun scenes" was Steven Spielberg in "Sugarland express".Some words on the sub-plot concerned with the hateful Rudy (Al Lettieri) and the cretinous Fran (Sally Struthers). This part of the film is deliberately disagreeable, up to an almost unbearable point. As usual, Peckinpah doesn't miss his chance to be hated by the feminists, with his design of Fran. A damned idiot, nymphomaniac just for stupidity. At the end, when Doc hits her (a punch straight on her prating, whimpering mouth!) the director nearly provokes a standing ovation by the audience (men and women, as well). If that's not cinematic genius, what else is it? And, speaking of imitators, how much Tarantino's characters owe to Rudy and Fran?Perhaps "The getaway" could have been even better without extraneous interference. Nonetheless, it is a fantastic film, a must-see. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Getaway has the very important "Three S's" which are so crucial to any film: Style, Substance, and Steve McQueen. This film, right behind PAPILLON, is definitely my favorite McQueen vehicle -- it's a big, BIG film (which makes sense, it takes place in Texas), has an epic feel, yet at the same time is very gritty and very honest in its approach to storytelling. The simplistic yet larger-than-life style of THE GETAWAY makes this flick a great watch on a Saturday Night.Oh, and you can't go wrong with Steve McQueen. At his side is *THE* girl-next-door type, the ultra-likable Ali MacGraw. Their chemistry is very obvious (which would make a lot of sense, the two had an on-set affair which was followed by a five year marriage), and it carries the film. The score, composed by Quincy Jones, hits all the right notes in all the right spots, and is definitely pivotal in giving THE GETAWAY its "feel." The supporting cast couldn't be better-suited to their roles. The bad guys are really bad, and quite despicable. Despite the sinister villains, this early 70s gem has a sense of humor. At times the more "innocent" characters are mocked by the situations they find themselves in, much to your amusement or disgust (I, for one, found laugh-out-loud moments all the way through). By the very nature of a McQueen film, the characters are all "approachable," and down to earth in their own strange way. In a nutshell, a simplistically epic film that finds the time to not take itself so seriously. While THE GETAWAY may not be the best to bring out at a movie get-together due to its slightly slow pacing and early 70s narrative (which, unfortunately, due to the breakneck music-video pacing of most "modern" films, tends to turn off anyone with a less-than-sufficient attention span), it is definitely worth a purchase, and something that you will be proud to say that you've seen.Long Live McQueen, and Have a RIB, Harold!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well-Crafted Heist Flick!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not one of S. Peckinpah's masterworks but one hell of a crime thriller. Steve McQueen is perfect as the cool, professional Doc and although Ali MacGraw (Steve's next wife) is breezily gorgeous she doesn't have the chops to make her character (Carol) too believable. Al Lettieri is creepier than he was in THE GODFATHER and Richard Bright (THE GODFATHER as well) has a nice bit as a small-timer. Ben Johnson has credibility as does Dub Taylor later. Throw in authentic Western icon Slim Pickens and you have a nice Southwest crime drama.A 7 out of 10. Best performance = Steve McQueen. He's very good with weapons and cars as he earlier proved. THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS are Peckinpah's masterpieces, but this is well worth a trip to the movies! Junior Bonner (a totally different type of sensibility) is also a fine film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen, the number one bad ass of his time (aside from Clint Eastwood of course). So what's wrong with rooting for the bad guy? This movie seems almost flawless with its excellently executed car chases, it's suspenseful and exciting shoot-outs, and its riveting emotional sequences. Both McGraw and McQueen make this movie well worth the experience. While it is a violent movie (especially for the year it was released!) its moments of comic relief and even serenity make this movie worthy of any moral person's eyes.Without spoiling the movie, just imagine Bonnie and Clyde with the greatest action/adventure experience ever. And to think it was over a measley $500,000... Of course, they were being chased for $750,000.9/10 for an adventure close to perfection.</fullReview>

Yes sir, "The Getaway" is a fantastic action movie. And it's got the best film star of them all -- Steve McQueen. Don't get me wrong. This film isn't just a lot of shooting and killing. It's got a story. And it's got characters. (Two things you don't get much of these days.)

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah's Best Violence Ballet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve McQueen and Sam Peckinpah teamed to do two straight films, probably some of the best work in both of their careers. But the difference in a nice character study like Junior Bonner and a tough crime drama like The Getaway shows the versatility of both these remarkable men. The Getaway seems to take its inspiration from John Huston's classic, The Asphalt Jungle.McQueen is a career criminal whose parole has once again been denied in the ten year stretch he's doing. Wife Ali McGraw submits to parole board chief Ben Johnson's sexual advances to spring McQueen. But the corrupt Johnson isn't just about sexual harassment. He wants McQueen to rob a bank that his brother is a director, to cover a nice case of embezzlement. He even recruits another pair of criminals, Bo Hopkins and Al Lettieri as part of the gang. Of course the plan goes wrong as a bank guard is killed and then Hopkins is killed in a double-cross by Lettieri who then fails to do the same to McQueen and McGraw. After that it's a three way race to the border between Johnson's men, Lettieri, and McQueen. Al Lettieri is a talent that was lost to us way too soon. He played some of the best villains in the early seventies and this one is one of them. He kidnaps veterinarian Jack Dodson and his slut of a wife Sally Struthers. Soon she's more than willing to go and be his girl. Struthers has a great part, so far from being Gloria Bunker Stivic on All in the Family.My favorite Sam Peckinpah moment in all of his films is that climax at Dub Taylor's flea bag hotel where all the forces meet and shoot up the place. It's Peckinpah's best violence ballet in all of his films, I never tire of seeing it.The whole film was shot in Texas and I'm not sure how residents of Texas might like this picture of their state. It seems to be one very violent place and a very corrupt one as well.But I like The Getaway very much, it's my favorite Sam Peckinpah film next to Ride the High Country.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Butler Did It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I`ve never been a fan of the heist genre since they always play out in an entirely formulaic way of having a plan , carrying out the plan and having a double cross at the end . THE GETAWAY is not all that different structure wise but what sets it apart from most movies in the genre is that it`s superbly directed by Sam Peckinpah . From the opening of Doc McCoy suffering hard prison time and having erotic musings about his wife ( Can`t say I blame him either ) you just know this is going to be a great film .Once again Peckinpah uses his unique cross cutting in slo mo between scenes but that`s not the only reason this is a great thriller , it`s also down to the cast . Okay maybe McQueen and McGraw don`t make an entirely convincing on screen couple but compare this to the husband and wife of STRAW DOGS . The one problem Peckinpah seems to have had in his movies is casting convincing on screen couples , is it any coincidence that his best movies like THE WILD BUNCH and CROSS OF IRON have been mainly female free ? Peckinpah also casts Ben Johnson and Bo Hopkins on a regular basis and they both appear here , Johnson plays an oily creep while Hopkins appears very briefly . Without doubt the best casting choice is the late Al Lettieri as Rudy Butler . Lettieri is the sort of actor who exudes menace just by breathing , he doesn`t have to say anything to make you tremble in your boots , he just has to look at you and you know it`s not going to be your day . Who`d be a vet after seeing this movie .If you`ve seen this classic thriller please don`t watch the 1990s remake because it`s utter crap . If you want to see Al Lettieri at his very best check out MR MAJESTYCK where he slaughters hundreds of defenceless watermelons</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting McQueen/MacGraw action movie with violent Peckinpah direction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1972 action crime movie begins with Steve McQueen (Carter `Doc' McCoy) passing time in prison. The fact that the time is slowly destroying him is creatively directed by Sam Peckinpah with lots of repetitive machine images and stop-action photography. McQueen's inner turmoil is exacerbated by losing a chess match with a fellow inmate and by his destruction of an intricate bridge model he spent a great deal of time building. The plot thickens when McCoy tells his wife to contact the local political boss and tell him that he is for sale and will do anything to get paroled.McQueen gets out and the action is on from this point forward. The bank robbery is screwed up and the leads to the long crazy getaway. McCoy's force partner Rudy, played by Al Lettieri (`Mr. Magestyk,' `The Godfather') has always played the consummate bad guy, and he does not disappoint here. In `The Getaway' Rudy kills the third partner, tries to kill McCoy at the meeting spot and then kidnaps a veterinarian and his wife (Sally Struthers and eventually makes her his girlfriend and her husband, who cannot takes it hangs himself.Like in most Peckinpah films it is the style and the violence that sticks out. There are memorable fisticuff scenes as well has the required explosions and gunshot scenes. Ones that stand out include the all too realistic slaps to the face to Ali MacGraw after Doc learns that he had been set up by her and the incredible beating of a thief played by Richard Bright (`The Panic in Needle Park' and `The Godfather' who unknowingly steals the bank robbery money in a con game in a train station and is eventually caught by McCoy. Also of note are a series of diversionary explosions that are set off right after the bank robbery and an incredible shotgun destruction of a police car. The grand finale in an El Paso hotel is not to be missed. As rough and violent as all of this is it is important to note a quieter more sympathetic side of McCoy that is played my Steve McQueen. On a few occasions he makes it clear to people in his path that if they do what he says, when he says it they will be left alone and therefore survive. Much like in Peckinpah's earlier film, `The Wild Bunch' there is an honor among thieves, or a code of ethics that is important for the protagonist(s) to uphold. Another aspect of this morality is played off in a sarcastic and ironic manner in the last seen. A trash collector played by Slim Pickens (`Dr. Strangelove,' `Blazing Saddles') is willingly kidnapped to assist McQueen and MacGraw cross the border into Mexico. Even though he has a good idea of the kinds of life the criminals are leading Pickens is very happy to hear that the couple is married and he feels that society is falling apart due to a lack of morals. In light of the excessive violence that occurs in this film it is funny that Peckinpah's film comments that all would be morally OK if young people just stick to the traditions of marriage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tough, Solid Crime Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I saw the 1994 re-make before I ever checked this movie out. The re- make being so sexual and violent I expected less of that stuff in here because it was made 20-some years earlier. Well, there was less sex but I think the violence might even have been heavier in this movie. This was a pretty rough film and it's interesting to note the "PG." Today, this would be rated at minimum PG-13.Also, a contrast between the two films, language-wise: back then you'd hear a lot more usage of the Lord's name in vain; nowadays, the f-word is more popular. Good guy Steve McQueen in here never utters a bad word and is still a tough, no- nonsense kind of guy. The rest of the characters are the same. There are no "talk before I shoot" hokey scenes or people missing from point-blank range.McQueen is great, as he usually was, and the rest of the cast is pretty interesting, too, from sleazy Sally Struthers (pre-"All In The Family") to Love Story's Ali McGraw to old-timers Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens. Al Letterei was also good in here. His name isn't familiar to me, but his face was.With either this or the re-make, you get a solid crime-action story with "The Getaway."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Under-rated crime thriller, considered unexceptional when made but now hailed as a semi-classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first released, Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway was generally dismissed as a routine action movie, quite unworthy of its star and director. But that opinion of the film is totally wrong: this is far from routine fare. It's a forceful, amoral, tightly editted, violent and nail-bitingly exciting thriller with coolness and style to burn. If anything, Peckinpah was crafting an action movie way ahead of its time; the critics - unsure of what to make of it - took the safe option and castigated it as an average potboiler. McQueen oozes an unnerving, charming aggression as Doc McCoy, a stolid ex-con who is no sooner out of jail than he is back to his criminal ways, robbing a bank with the help of his wife (Ali MacGraw). It would be a spoiler to reveal too many details of the robbery, but it's enough to add that things go wrong and Mr and Mrs McCoy end up fleeing for Mexico, with a stash of cash and a whole bunch of gun-toting bad guys (as well as the cops) in hot pursuit. The film is loosely structured, with the gun-toting couple stumbling from one blood-soaked adventure to the next, picaresque-style, as they attempt to reach the Mexican border. MacGraw looks a bit lost amid all this heavy-weight acting talent, but she gets away with it because she shares a lot of screen time with McQueen.... and when he's on screen, you tend not to notice her (so mesmerising is he that you just can't take your eyes off him). Some of the gunfights are explosive and entertaining affairs, and the characters are brilliantly realised. Peckinpah has a good eye for graphic detail, but he also captures the barren wastelands of Texas with the kind of loving grace that you would usually expect from a landscape painter. The Getaway is a cracking '70s thriller, well worth re-visiting and unquestionably a lot better than the depressingly "pretty" '90s remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Peckinpah Home Run</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sick and tired of new releases I couldn't get through 45 minutes of, I went back to a classic: Sam Peckinpah's The Getaway. What a breath of fresh air this 1972 heist/chase movie turned out to be. In addition to hyper realistic characterizations of the McCoys (played by Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw), everything else about this movie rings true. 35 years later, Peckinpah's signature slo-motion shoot outs stand up against anything in the theaters today. There's little to dislike about this movie and I can't help but wonder why movies aren't made like this anymore: no special FX, no over-the-top stunt sequences, no melodramatic dialogue, not fat, no filler. This is a movie made by real people, for real people. Plain and simple.Technically, the stand-out aspect within The Getaway is the editing. Influenced by the French New Wave, Peckinpah defies convention by playing with time and space as he uses disjointed cuts to jump ahead in time before allowing the events within the movie to catch up to the present. The most interesting example of this occurs when Doc and Carol are at a busy park alongside a river. Doc has just been released from prison and he's soaking in the sights and sounds of freedom. Peckinpah cuts to a shot of Doc jumping into the river with his clothes on, followed by Carol. At first this feels like a fantasy in Doc's head since we abruptly cut back to the present where Doc is still standing and looking at the river. But soon he actually does run to and jump into the river. From there we cut directly to Carol's apartment where the two enter soaking wet and smiling. It is atypical and unexpected to see unconventional editing like this in mainstream American movies, but when it's done (and done right) there' something incredibly rewarding about having your brain (and expectations) teased in such a randomly disjointed (yet fluid) way. Another example of unconventional yet incredibly effective montage happens in the opening thirty minutes. In this sequence Doc McCoy (McQueen) is locked up in prison and slowly losing his wits. Peckinpah portrays Doc's inner head space through a dizzying montage of shots of Doc in and around the prison, where synced sound cuts smash into one another in a relentlessly pounding and oppressive manner. You get the sense something has to break and before long you realize it's Doc's resolve.Peckinpah proves with The Getaway that you don't need astounding source material to make a great movie. On the written page I'm sure this film seemed like a very standard heist/chase film. But by allowing the actors to bring realistic, idiosyncratic performances to the table and by utilizing unorthodox techniques, such as French New Wave inspired editing, Peckinpah elevates pulp into high art. I know I'm sounding like a broken record by saying this but: where are the artists in Hollywood today?http://eattheblinds.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Top action/thriller flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better than the 1994 remake starring Baldwin and Basinger. As always, McQueen is fantastic here as thief "Doc McCoy" who's wife has just helped him out of prison. His screen presence is incredibly strong, and as usual he plays the the King of Cool to a tee. MacGraw, as his wife "Carol", turns in a solid performance (and looks ravishingly gorgeous as well), and the chemistry between her and McQueen is palpable (it's no surprise that they married after shooting this film), even though they barely touch each other (save for one or two kissing scenes). But there's noticeable angst and frustration between Doc and Carol; not only because he's been in jail for a few years, but also because Doc learns that Carol prostituted herself to get him out of jail. Ultimately, of course, this husband and wife team of thieves just can't live without each other. The action moves along at a good pace, and the car chases and shooting scenes are top notch - not fake like other action movies during the time. From the bank robbery to the various problems the couple face trying to escape to Mexico, the film is exciting and thrilling. It's also a bonus hoot to see McQueen and MacGraw (two of the biggest stars of the time) dumped at a garbage tip and covered in garbage. Very good action film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Getaway: The last days of the pure Action-film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before Action became routine and Bruce Willis there was the 1970´s Action-film, which often had a lot of mood. "The Getaway" is one of those films, showing what range the Action-film could have - there is more than violence and wannabe-cool dialog here. This was before the Action-films became exaggerated, instead of having just explosions and being over-explicit there is booth plot and suspense in "The Getaway". It let Peckinpah use his well known style, in the way of Boorman´s "Point Blank". The result is pure. Ali McGraw is said to be limited and stiff, but Peckinpah made her solid here. I guess that Steve McQueen never was better than here, even if some wouldn't agree. Some of Peckinpah´s regular starred (such as Ben Johnson, Slim Pickens, Bo Hopkins and Dub Taylor) which makes it even better today - the impact of Peckinpah is powerful.Rating: 8 of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Paying A Price For Freedom</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Getaway" is an action packed crime thriller which cleaned up at the box office and provided director Sam Peckinpah with the biggest hit of his career. Beyond that, it's also a movie which contains some tense passages, an intriguing series of plot twists and an insight into the strains which affect the relationship of a married couple.With Peckinpah at the helm, it's no surprise that there's plenty of blood and violence in evidence but what's most impressive is the exciting action sequences (car chases, shoot-outs etc) and the proficient style of editing which makes them so spectacular and compelling to watch.Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen), a career thief, finds the constraints of prison life unbearable and is frustrated that despite his good behaviour, he's been refused parole. In desperation he sends his wife Carol (Ali McGraw) to local corrupt politician Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to tell him that McCoy is for sale. Beynon (who serves on the parole board) uses his influence and Doc is given his freedom, but it comes at a price.Beynon employs Doc to rob a small town bank for a half share in the proceeds and insists that he uses Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) and Frank Jackson (Bo Hopkins) to help carry out the heist. Jackson is an unstable character who unnecessarily kills a bank guard and is then killed by Butler when they're making their escape. When Doc and Carol (who'd been travelling in another vehicle) reunite with Butler, he tries to shoot them but Doc shoots first and Butler is left for dead.Doc meets with Beynon and discovers that the bank heist had been organised to cover up the loss of $250,000 which Beynon's brother (a member of the bank's board) had misappropriated. Furthermore, he learns that Carol had slept with Beynon in order to ensure his freedom. Unexpectedly, Carol arrives at the meeting, opens fire and kills Beynon and then the couple go on the run and head for Mexico. Their journey proves to be very hazardous as they are forced to evade the attentions of the police and also get followed by Beynon's brother and his gang. What's more, Rudy Butler had only been injured in his confrontation with Doc and had since kidnapped a veterinarian and his wife and was also following in hot pursuit.The McCoys' pursuers finally catch up with them at an El Paso hotel which is regularly used as a safe house by criminals and a brilliantly staged massive shoot-out follows.Steve McQueen is typically intense and charismatic in one of his most successful roles as a skilled criminal who's furious about what Carol did with Beynon but decides not to leave her. Ali McGraw shows her character's habitual uneasiness and uncertainty and Al Lettieri provides the best supporting performance as an insane killer with no redeeming qualities whatsoever."The Getaway" was based on one of Jim Thompson's novels and is predictably hardboiled in style. It also has a rather grim quality which runs through its entire story and has an ending which would certainly not have been sanctioned during the Production Code era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crime Pays, a little</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If one is looking for a tough, gutsy, action oriented story about a professional criminal who takes on the law and gives it a run for its money, "The Get-Away" is for you. This film is one of the most stirring and awesome films created to-date. It begin within a maximum Texas prison where one, Carter 'Doc' McCoy, (Steve McQueen) is waiting out his sentence for bank robbery and expects to be released soon. As with most prison systems, it's subject to manipulations from the rich and powerful. In this case we have Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson, with superb acting) who is both. It is he who uses his influence to "spring" our hero, with the caveat that he commit a personal bank robbery for him. Each man has much to gain and just as much to lose as there is obvious tension and distrust from the arrangement. What follows is one of the best double-crossing, shoot-'em ups, high speed chases ever created by director Sam Peckenpaw. Along the way, we have a notable college of film stars as could be gather to make a truly memorable saga. For instance, we have Ali MacGraw as Carol McCoy, Al Lettieri as dangerous, vengeful and homicidal Rudy Butler. Slim Pickens as a truck-driving Cowboy. Famous Dub Taylor is ex-drunk Laughlin, Bo Hopkins as Frank Jackson and Roy Jenson as Cully. If one is looking for a superior motion picture which sets the standard for Action-Drama, this is it. A Classic, if ever there was one. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and exciting ride if you haven't read Jim Thompson's original hard boiled classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Getaway' is Sam Peckinpah in gun for hire mode making a commercial heist-gone-wrong/lovers-on-the-run movie. He tried to do something similar later in the Seventies with 'Convoy', but that one strayed too far into studio compromise and was nowhere near as successful on an artistic level. Even though one gets the feeling that the movie's star Steve McQueen was calling the shots, Peckinpah still manages to add some of his trademark flamboyant violence and moral ambiguity to what is, let's face it, essentially an action movie. And I must say it is a very good action movie at that, and one many directors today working in this often tired and lazy genre could learn a thing or two from concerning suspense, drama and genuine excitement. The less you know about Jim Thompson's original novel the more you will enjoy this movie. Walter Hill (future director of 'The Warriors' and 'Southern Comfort') takes most of the basic plot, but leaves out the brilliant final chapter set in the hellish criminal haven El Ray. Apparently this was at the insistence of Steve McQueen who thought it too depressing. I also would guess that McQueen influenced Hill to alter the character of Doc McCoy from the book's charming sociopath to a more traditional tough-but-still-fairly decent career criminal. Maybe McQueen felt more comfortable pulling that style off, which is odd because he showed a lot more depth in Peckinpah's low key 'Junior Bonner'. In this one respect 'The Getaway's inferior 1990s remake was closer to Thompson's original spirit by casting Alec Baldwin in the same role. Anyway, if you forget about the book, and accept this movie for what it is, and not what it might have been it is a taut and impressive thriller. McQueen and the beautiful Ali McGraw (then husband and wife) show some real chemistry and are consistently watchable. Peckinpah uses many of his regular dependable character actors (Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor) to support them, including a first rate Ben Johnson ('The Wild Bunch') in an uncharacteristically nasty role. Al Letteri ('The Godfather') also impresses as McQueen's conniving colleague, Slim Pickens ('Dr Strangelove') as a helpful old geezer, Sally Struthers ('All In The Family') as a blonde bimbo, and the underrated Richard Bright ('Vigilante', 'Crimewave', 'The Godfather') has a scene stealing bit as a con-man who bites off more than he can chew. 'The Getaway' is by no means Peckinpah's most interesting or impressive movie but it is solid entertainment that is hard to beat, and should be watched by any self-respecting Seventies movie fan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film was written for Steve McQueen, not the other way around</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before "Oceans Eleven", before "The Bank Job", before "Carlito's Way", there was this film. I am a sucker for 1970s movies because I love the imagery of that decade and this film does not disappoint.The plot is nothing new; McQueen gets out of jail and needs to another Bank heist as payment for his freedom. As you might expect not all goes to plan. Soon our heroes are cris-crossing Texas, trying to avoid several corrupt Texans, the police and a psychotic criminal.The casting, naturally, is spot on. A great pack of villains, attractive and racy leads, and several realistic side characters that compliment McQueen and McCraw perfectly.This is my first Peckinpah venture. He really was a directorial talent who fit the zeitgeist of the 60s and 70s very well with his penchant for sexual interplay and violence. His grasp of colour and capturing the right image is amongst the best of any era. The pacing of the film is varied, but always keeps us surprised with numerous twists and turns along the way.Its an essential gangster film. It doesn't try to be anything more, but its great entertainment and it retains a gritty realism that rises it above its competitors.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Getting away with it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the many things that gives 1972's The Getaway the edge over its now almost-forgotten remake is that, unlike Alec Baldwin, Steve McQueen doesn't act like a movie star ? he is a movie star. From the days when cool was what you were, not what you wore or owned, the plot itself is nothing special: Steve McQueen's bank robber is sprung from jail to pull a job with wife Ali MacGraw and has to hightail it to Mexico with both the relentless double-crossing Al Lettieri and numerous Texas mobsters in hot pursuit. Like most chase thrillers, you've seen it before: it's what Peckinpah does with it that counts, and Peckinpah does plenty. Most of Peckinpah's usual trademarks can be found in the margins, from children's fascination with violence to the Hellfire and brimstone preacher whose radio sermon goes unheard, and the action scenes are superbly staged ? especially the hotel shootout and the lovingly filmed shooting up of a police car ? but just as importantly he keeps a clear focus on his characters. The film's emotional terrain is as harsh as the barren landscape the ensuing chase is set against, with the odds on McQueen and MacGraw's marriage making it just as touch-and-go as whether they will make it across the border in one piece, their road to possible marital redemption through ordeal mirrored with the fast-track to Hell that hostage couple Sally Struthers and Jack Dodson take chauffeuring Lettieri's perverse wounded animal on their trail.It's probably Sam Peckinpah's last truly successful film before self-indulgence, laziness and too much booze and drugs took their toll on his work. True, it's a purely commercial piece that has none of the personal passion that drove The Wild Bunch or The Ballad of Cable Hogue, but it's put together with a level of genuine artistry that's way above the norm for the genre: the editing of the first twenty minutes alone, with its freeze-frames and non-linear structure, is remarkably adventurous and successful. Both perfectly representing the state of mind and frustration and disorientation of McQueen's character in a way that is both complex and yet entirely accessible and transforming what could have been bog-standard exposition into something much more memorable, it's strikingly effective. Far more entertaining than it has any right to be.(On an incidental note, although Walter Hill claimed that little of his screenplay made it to the screen (the bleak ending of Jim Thompson's novel is replaced by a much sweeter and more optimistic one), it's interesting to note how much of the film he would rework in his own The Driver, from the destruction of a car in a key setpiece to the train sequence with a very (un)lucky bagman.)

		<shortDescription>a Peckinpah crime picture through and through; efficient in storytelling, violent as all hell</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway won't bring up too many doctoral theses like the Wild Bunch (at least on its own, maybe as part of a Sam Peckinpah grouping of films dissected), but it's one of the director's best non-Western films. It's got a cracker-jack story that seems like it's been pulled right off the paperback rack at the candy store: an ex-con, Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is yanked out of a lengthy jail-term thanks to a Texas mob guy/bank-connection (Ben Johnson), and not in small part due to his wife Carol (Ali McGraw), but it's all in due to a planned bank robbery, which goes off well except that the aftermath gets screwy. McCoy and his girl go off on the run to El Paso, while a creepy lecherous crook, Rudy (Al Lettieri) tries to beat them to the punch after getting shot by McCoy. From there on in Peckinpah via writers Jim Thompson and Walter Hill supplant a bunch of very suspenseful scenes, with the half a million put into peril; McCoy gets his face put on all the papers, making him all too easy. There's mishaps with a garbage truck (a fantastically subversive scene, with the subtext being 'the things I'll do to get money'), and a group attached to Johnson's character who always look like they're waiting for something by the phones. And Rudy, of course, as one of the more nasty villains in Peckinpah's work.All in all the film is mostly made spectacular because Peckinpah doesn't short-change the audience on the goods. This is a work of classy film-making immersed in sleazy circumstances, a Texas heist picture where knowing your guns is a pre-requisite and it's more about knowing how to evade capture and not hedge your bets than real ingenuity. Peckinpah also infuses with this typically pulpy material (Thompson was one of the co-writers on The Killing script) with his trademark visual panache: it's not glamorous violence in any way, but you can't look away from how he makes it brilliant in the pacing (the editing is top-notch and some of the best I've seen in any thriller of the 70s), in everything leading up to a violent moment or contact, and the brutality which can only come from a filmmaker who trusts his audience like this. And it's very wise to have McQueen as McCoy, a true take-no-prisoners anti-hero who may not be the most in-depth criminal mastermind/fugitive, but boy can he be the one to bet on as getting away with it all. McGraw, meanwhile, isn't quite as effective, but then again she's not given a really developed character to work with. How and why she's so attached to McCoy to not leave him is a little faux Bonnie and Clyde, but for the most part I didn't mind.Meanwhile, Peckinpah puts in his supporting ranks some high-caliber talent, with Lettieri doing a lot with so little; his sub-plot involves taking hostage a doctor and his woman, and there's a lot to be read into what happens in this as he starts to over-take the woman, as it were, with real brutish force that puts the doctor into his own end. But the irony isn't lost on Peckipah in his subversive state, and there's a laugh-out-loud moment when there's a cute black kitty sitting on his chest while resting from gun-shot wounds. Then of course there's Johnson, a usual Peckinpah alumni, and a great bit from Slim Pickens towards the end. Featuring a sweet Quincy Jones soundtrack, and a storyline that unfolds where unpredictability is paramount, The Getawat is a better-than-expected thriller where the criminals are hard-edged and dangerous, and where money almost becomes a MacGuffin to bring out the worst in men.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film centers about a robber named "Doc" McCoy (Steve McQueen) is paroled from a Texas state prison , somewhat to his surprise . His spouse , Carol (Ali McGraw) , has arranged for his freedom by sleeping with the corrupt but politically well connected Jack Benyon (Ben Johnson) . Ben Johnson assigns him a heist helped by Al Lettieri and Bo Hopkins but he's betrayed and the events burst .In the motion picture there is suspense , drama , thriller, car pursuits and amount of violence reflected in slow-moving shots typical of Peckinpah . From the beginning to the end the action-packed is interminable . The final confrontation at hotel between the starring , Steve McQueen , Ali McGraw and the enemies is breathtaking and overwhelming . The picture has been classified ¨R¨ for crude murders and isn't apt for little boys , neither squeamish . However , it was rated PG by the MPAA in the United States. A few years later, in retrospect, this was considered a mistake and the board believed that the film should have been rated one step higher, an R . Steve McQeen and Ali McGraw's (marriage in real life) interpretation is top-notch . Sam Peckinpah direction is excellent though is better in Western films (Wild bunch , Pat Garret and Billy the Kid , Bring me the head Alfredo Garcia and Major Dundee).The movie obtained success and originated a remake featured by Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger (marriage in real life, too) although failed at box office . The yarn will appeal to action buffs and Peckinpah fans . Rating : 7/10 .Well catching</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He didn't make it. Neither did you.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The most commercially successful of all of Sam Peckinpah's movies, THE GETAWAY may be a bit short of the masterpiece status that has been given to THE WILD BUNCH and STRAW DOGS, but it's nevertheless a great deal better than the hyperviolent action films we've been exposed to in Hollywood since his untimely demise in 1984. Put him and star Steve McQueen in with a screenplay by future action director Walter Hill (48 HRS.) from a classic Jim Thompson book, and you've got the makings of a very well-made piece.McQueen stars as Carter "Doc" McCoy, a career criminal who has served four years of a ten-year prison sentence in Texas for armed robbery. He is given early parole by the parole board chairman (Ben Johnson)...but on one condition: He and two associates (Bo Hopkins, Al Lettieri) must rob a bank without killing anybody! Initially, the operation seems to be working; but when Hopkins kills a guard he had disabled, everything goes haywire. Lettieri kills Hopkins almost immediately after they leave the bank. And when McQueen wounds Lettieri after learning what happened to Hopkins ("He didn't make it. Neither did you" is Lettieri's response), the stage is set for a motor-and-blood-driven chase across the Lone Star State. And yet there is still one thing McQueen hadn't counted upon: his wife (Ali MacGraw) getting it on with Johnson to facilitate McQueen's early release. The Peckinpah theme of betrayal rears its head here.Many bursts of violence, car chases, and a hair-raising scene in a garbage truck later, McQueen and MacGraw reconcile, and then face off with Lettieri and Johnson's minions in a gut-grabbing, suspenseful shootout in El Paso.McQueen's low-key style of acting, displayed many times before, notably in his 1968 smash BULLITT, comes to the fore once again in THE GETAWAY, under Peckinpah's hard-hitting direction. MacGraw's performance has been heavily slammed, but I don't think it is nearly as bad as many have made it out to be. Excellent cinematography from Lucien Ballard and a taut, R&amp;B-style music score by Quincy Jones (substituted for a Jerry Fielding score at McQueen's insistence) help immeasurably, as does the on-location shooting in Texas. Peckinpah has also loaded the film with cohorts like Johnson, Slim Pickens, John Bryson, Jack Dodson, and Dub Taylor doing typically fine cameo roles. Although it may be long at 123 minutes, THE GETAWAY is nevertheless a superior action/suspense film from Peckinpah, THE modern master of the form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely great heist-gone-wrong classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>King of cool Steve McQueen teams with "Bloody Sam" Peckinpah for this thoroughly engaging story of a couple on the lam following a botched robbery.Walter Hill adapts the novel by Jim Thompson in this story of Carter "Doc" McCoy (McQueen), a criminal currently doing time. His wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) manages to secure his release by playing up to crooked parole board chief Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson); Doc and Carol are then made to participate in a bank robbery which goes as wrong as movie lovers everywhere could expect it to. Doc and Carol have to make their way across Texas to Mexico and safety while being trailed by Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri), a vengeance minded member of the gang.The cast simply couldn't be better in this sexy, slick, violent production; even MacGraw isn't bad as the wife with a loyalty to her man through thick and thin. McQueen once again has an undeniable presence on screen and the viewer can believe that he's going to keep going despite the odds. Johnson is enjoyably slimy, Lettieri scores as a truly rotten creep, and Richard Bright, Jack Dodson, Dub Taylor, Bo Hopkins, and Roy Jenson all do well in assorted memorable bits. The ever affable Slim Pickens doesn't appear until near the end of the picture, but he helps to close it on a very ingratiating final note.Peckinpah is in very fine form here, creating a milieu where moral considerations often go out the window. Doc isn't necessarily a "good guy", yet we still can't help but root for him, especially when characters like Beynon and Butler are even worse. Just to give people an idea of how sleazy Butler is, he thinks nothing of dallying with vapid, sexpot blonde Fran (Sally Struthers) in front of her weakling husband Harold (Dodson). The many vignettes along the way keep you eagerly watching - Doc is forced to pursue another thief (Bright) to get his own ill gotten money back, for one - but the highlight is undeniably the incredibly tense sequence aboard the garbage truck. Peckinpah once again demonstrates a real flair for the kind of stylized violence he perfected in "The Wild Bunch", with blood spurting and many squibs exploding.People can hardly fail to notice that again the director is not about to go the politically correct route, as a resentful Doc, still not happy about what Carol did with Beynon, slaps her around. Yet, when Doc punches Frans' lights out later, it actually provokes a reaction of relief from the audience because it puts an end to her shrill whining.Overall the film makes for fine entertainment. Even at two hours and three minutes, it's remarkably well paced and tension filled, and it never falters, kicking into gear for a rousing final act. Highly recommended.10 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Important and Influential Actions films of All Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Heist is a landmark action film. It is surprising that it is so overlooked. It looms large over the film action genre over the past two decades. Almost every action film owes something to this remarkable masterpiece by Peckinpah at the the height of his directorial powers. For starters, the garbage compactor scene was directly lifted by George Lucas in Star Wars. The dialogue, pacing, and editing are stamped all over Tarantino's films. The action sequences are the starting point for John Woo's Triad masterpieces. A few movies that bear out the direct influence include Point Break (which the story and action sequences are similar); as well as Ben Affleck's The Town.The script by a then up and coming Walter Hill, based upon a Jim Thompson novel, is perfection in itself. In fact, all of Hill's movies can be tied in one way or another to his screenplay in The Getaway. In fact I don't think it's a stretch to say the brash direction and machismo was a defining influence on Takeshi Kitano's directorial career.By all means, if you are a film lover and have not seen this one, you are indeed lucky to be able to see it for the first time. Usually, Peckinpah is defined by critics with his film The Wild Bunch and by general consensus - consider it his best. After seeing this film, it is no longer true for me - this is Peckinpah's finest hour. McQueen shows why he is still regarded as a legend - a simply unforgettable performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Sam Peckinpah's Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Peckinpah struck pay dirt with this adaptation of author Jim Thompson's novel about an inside bank job in contemporary Texas. Not only did "The Getaway" prove to be a hit for Peckinpah but it also bolstered Steve McQueen's career. Previously, Peckinpah and McQueen had collaborated on "Junior Bonner," but "Bonner" did nothing for them at the box office. The film is an amazingly mellow movie for a Peckinpah film and is comparable to "The Ballad of Cable Hogue." Conversely, "The Getaway" contained virtually everything that a Peckinpah movie needed, primarily action, intrigue, and violence. Mind you, "The Getaway" wasn't as intense as "The Wild Bunch" and not as heavy-handed philosophically as "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid." Despite its somewhat kinky subplot, "The Getaway" is the kind of Peckinpah movie where things go right for the hero and the heroine with an amenable ending.Texas millionaire Jack Benyon (Ben Johnson of "The Wild Bunch") needs a top gun to rob one of his banks, and Carter 'Doc' McCoy (Steve McQueen of "Bullitt") is going to pieces slowly in Huntsville Prison. Every time that he applies for parole, he gets shot down. Doc gets his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw of "Love Story") to get to Johnson. Doc wins his parole, but he thinks that Carol sold him out. Nevertheless, he meets once with Benyon in San Antonio and greets his team of men for the bank heist. They have their conference aboard the little party barges on the Riverwalk tourist attraction. During the planning stages of the robbery, tempers flare between Doc and Rudy Butler (Al Letteri of "McQ") about the use of bullet-proof vests. Anyway, Doc cases the bank and they check out its alarm system. Meanwhile, Doc has Rudy and Frank Jackson (Bo Hopkins of "The Killer Elite") to plant explosive charges at different ends of town to distract the authorities when the robbery goes down. During the robbery, Frank loses his cool. Our heroes get away with the loot, but Rudy murders Frank and tries to double-cross Doc. Doc is just a little too fast for him. Ironically, despite his boasts of not wearing a bullet-proof vest, Rudy is wearing a vest when Doc nails him and leaves him for dead. Rudy takes an animal doctor (Jack Dodson) and his wife (Sally Struthers of TV's "All in the Family") hostage and has the husband dress his wounds. Rudy and company follow Doc and Carol. At Jack Benyon's house, Carol guns Jack down, but Doc doesn't trust her. They head for El Paso with Rudy hot on their trail. "The Getaway" represented a personal high for Peckinpah and the film made a killing at the box office. The opening scenes that depict Doc's mental breakdown behind bars are masterful. Lettieri makes a nefarious villain and Ben Johnson is simply dastardly. The final shoot-out in a motel in El Paso is great. When our heroes get to the border, they have to deal with an old cowboy (Slim Pickins) and sells them his truck. A memorable Peckinpah epic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violence, depth and the king of cool.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Sam Peckinpah was known in the '70's for making violent action movies. Violence that we are used to know but was still all something new and provoking at its time. You could say that he helped to define the genre, since you also have to remember that action wasn't really considered to be much of a genre at the early '70's. There were movies with action sequences in it of course but these often would be put under a more different label, such as thriller, war, adventure or even drama. The action was never what the movies were fully truly were about, while Sam Peckinpah movies were.Still Peckinpah movies also have an amazing depth to it, due to the way they are being build up and the story is being told. "The Getaway is a movie with criminals and action in it but at the same time the story also manages to be a love drama, when the relationship of the two main characters of the movie is being put under pressure. The two of them float away from each other and at times they are clinging on to each other again, since after all they seemed to be made for each other and form a perfect couple.Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw form this love duo and even though MacGraw wasn't much of a great actress, the two still form one of the best and strangely also sweetest screen couples. In real life McQueen and MacGraw would also marry one year later but like most Hollywood marriages it ended in divorce, only a few years later.McQueen is of course perfectly cast, as he is undoubtedly being the king of cool and all. McQueen was one of the only actors who could do dull and lame stuff and still making it like extremely cool. But he is not the only great actor in the movie. Even though Slim Pickens plays a very small part, it still is a very memorable one, which is for most part due to his great performance of it. Al Lettieri was one of the greatest '70's movie villains, which villainous roles in movies such as "The Godfather" and "Mr. Majestyk" as well, before his early death in 1975. It was not just his acting that often made him a memorable villain but also certainly his menacing look helped a lot. Other fine actors that appear in this movie are Richard Bright and Ben Johnson, among others.It's a real '70's movie, meaning that it has some renewing editing and camera-work. It's a fast cut movie, with an average shot length of 3.5 seconds. This of course helps making this a real action movie, for the movie itself isn't even really action filled with shoot outs or car chases. It above all things remains a movie that relies on its well written script, that is given real depth by the directing approach of Sam Peckinpah and the acting performances of the lead cast.A superior constructed and told action-flick from the early '70's.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah and McQueen fuse together for tough outlaw road movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on Jim Thompson's novel, The Getaway finds director Sam Peckinpah, and king of cool actor Steve McQueen, turning to hard grit drama after the sedate splendour of Junior Bonner earlier in the year.Doc McCoy is released early from prison due to some string pulling from influential gangster Jack Benyon, however it comes under condition that McCoy pulls off a bank robbery for the gruff smarmy Benyon. Thus the seed is sown for double crosses, murder, cross country pursuits, adultery, and carnage Peckinpah style.Steve McQueen is excellent as McCoy, few actors can claim to look so good when popping off a pump action shotgun, or shooting a pistol complete with arm recoil, and here he has Peckinpah to maximise the damage whilst poetically portraying the slow-mo death sequences. Al Lettieri is vile thug Rudy Butler who is in hot pursuit of McCoy &amp; his wife Carol, a wonderful weasel turn full of cold abusive charm that reeks of menace. Sadly the film is let down a touch by the performance of Ali MacGraw as Carol, it's a terribly wooden performance that threatens to undo all the good things in the film, but luckily McQueen manages to ease her thru the production to minimise the damage.This of course is the film where both of them fell madly in love and ended up getting married to each other, the chemistry is good, but it's just that MacGraw's delivery of her lines lacks emotion or fortitude. Peckinpah disagreed with the critics of the time, even sending a letter to MacGraw praising her efforts. However when she turned up for the shoot unable to drive a car, he was less than pleased since her character was the getaway driver! Full of fine sequences and bloody scenarios, it stands up as a real good Sam Peckinpah picture, it's a kind of city set western where the outlaws are actually coming across as heroes. We get pulled into this couple's world and we want so much for them to achieve their goals, so add that feeling to the gritty structure of the story and you get a real enjoyable piece benefiting from great work from director and charismatic leading man alike. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Peckinpah's finest, a real pulp fiction classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure, this is pretty much Sam Peckinpah in for hire mode. This doesn't include the pessimism present in his more personal works, such as "Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia" or "Straw Dogs". Still, even when Peckinpah is simply trying to pay the bills, he still is able to turn out a highly exciting and entertaining flick. "The Getaway" is a much better film than most auteur works. Its one of the 70s finest crime thrillers, and that decade is known for turning out many hardboiled classics. I know fans of Jim Thompson's original novel have detracted this film for not being faithful and changing the original ending. I have yet to read the book (I've checked out other stuff by the legendary crime writer though), so I probably get the most out of this tight and taut little flick.As usual, Peckinpah's direction is superb. He keeps everything moving at a lightning quick pace. No one was finer at staging action sequences than he was. The performances aren't ones filled with depth or subtlety, but for this kind of flick, they really don't need to be. Steve McQueen is his usual self, a too cool for words tough guy. Watching him here, its no wonder he became a major movie star still remains the king of cool. Ali MacGraw, an actress I've never been a huge fan of, is very good as well, creating a more sympathetic character to balance out McQueen. The rest of the supporting cast is peppered with familiar faces, who are all very good as well, but this is McQueen and MacGraw's show all the way. Thirty-five years later, this is still a classic of pulp cinema - highly recommended. (9/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a few years, between "The Wild Bunch" in 1969 and this exciting action film in 1972, Peckinpah was at his creative peak, making a series of terrific films. McQueen has one of his best roles as a cool bank robber who must deal with double-crossing cohorts. MacGraw can't act but she looks hot as McQueen's wife (a role she played off-screen as well after this film). Lettieri makes a nasty villain while Struthers plays a character far removed from Gloria Stivic. There is an amusing score by Jones. Peckinpah directs with a lot of energy and keeps the action moving at a fast clip, with fine vignettes, such as the scene at the railway station.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love, Peckinpah Style</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For Ali MacGraw, love means never having to say you're sorry, even when you rob a bank, shoot bad guys, and sleep with a parole board member to spring your husband from jail.That's some of what Carol McCoy (Ali) does for hubby Doc (Steve McQueen) in "The Getaway", Sam Peckinpah's version of the relationship drama complete with car chases, shoot-em-ups, and tearful reconciliations in junkyards. It's a surprisingly effective film that contrasts the McCoys' troubled union with a seedy, sordid world where life and love are to be had cheap, Texas is one big institutionalized prison, and the only freedom is to be found across the border in Mexico.For people who don't know Peckinpah films, this is a good one to see either just before or after "The Wild Bunch", with which "Getaway" shares many qualities. Both start with a similar freeze-frame credit sequences, both feature bank jobs gone wrong (and preceded by town parades), both shift back and forth between pursuer and prey, and both have Mexico as a final destination. The difference is that "The Getaway," for all its gritty moments to assure us Sam hasn't gone soft, allows for a sense of hope and future missing from "The Wild Bunch".Good things about this film include McQueen (along with "Bullitt" his most iconic part), Al Littieri as the psycho Rudy, Sally Struthers as Rudy's all-too-willing hostage Fran, real location shooting by "Wild Bunch" collaborator Lucien Ballard that sets up the film's desperate tone, and a score by Quincy Jones that isn't memorable in itself but effective in the way it sets up the picture. The harmonica work by Toots Theilemans feels in-between two of Q's better scores: "In The Heat Of The Night" and "Sanford And Son".On the debit side is a script that feels cobbled together, Ben Johnson's too-short supporting work as the menacing shadow-figure Beynon, a plug-ugly supporting cast that makes Dub Taylor look like Rod Taylor, and some oddly flat action sequences. Others also knock MacGraw, but I won't. She adds oodles of sex appeal and plays well off McQueen in the central relationship, compensating for some lame line readings with the way her eyes light up when he punches the gas in their car.What makes the film work best for me is that it is a Peckinpah movie that doesn't do what you expect from a Peckinpah movie. There's violence and boys-will-be-boys brutality, but the director also plays cagily against your expectations by allowing room for warmth and gentleness. McQueen's cool, but he cares. The real-life romance between McQueen and MacGraw attracted lots of filmgoers in 1972, but the film plays against the actors' hotitude by making them shy and awkward around one another, more worried about what's going on in each other's head than between the sheets.Peckinpah even has some romantic dialogue, though not exactly Rick and Ilsa:Him: "You don't like the way things are, I don't like the way things are. Maybe we should split up."Her: "Well I don't want to."Later...Her: "I think if we ever get out of this dump, I'll just split."Him: "We've made it together so far."Not Hallmark Channel material, but it displays a deeper emotional investment from Peckinpah in the inner lives of his characters, one recognizable to anyone who has been through a relationship. Beyond the bullets and bloodshed, that's what "The Getaway" is about, and why it works. Love doesn't excuse you from apologizing, but it's nice to know it rewards you for trying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen, MacGraw, Peckinpah...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is how action movies should be made these days - tense all throughout, bursts of violence, and of course the slo-motion favoured by Peckinpah. Modern Western idiom works well, some great character actors appear - Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri, Slim Pickens - the two leads are superb. McQueen was not the most eloquent actor but that is of no importance here - he asks MacGraw for "whiskey, whiskey, whiskey..." Films try hard to be cool but this does it - from the taut opening sequence of McQueen doing bird to his lady's choice of victims. Shane MacGowan, leader of the Pogues, once commented that this was well worth watching - any film where a 12-Gauge pump-action is the star of the film. Remade in the 90's badly, even if it does have Michael Madsen.</fullReview>

This kind of film (with a real grainy sense of impending menace) couldn't be made to this standard in today's sanitised Hollywood. Solid support from Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens, and a great soundtrack from Quincy Jones make this one of the reasons why the 70's is viewed as the golden age of modern cinema. With Ali MacGraw's performance, you do wonder if with a better choice of material, her career might have been much more fruitful. Seek this film out, watch and enjoy (and try your very hardest to avoid the pointless Basinger/Baldwin remake).</fullReview>

My uncle, Weston (Wes) Webb was the main carpenter and built the sets for this movie and my aunt Jean got to be "on the set" friends with Sally. Once she asked my aunt to help her pick out a piece of jewelry for her mother. Outside the jewelry store Sally turned to my aunt and gave her the piece of jewelry. She had planned it to be for her all along. How nice! Someone has a photo of my aunt and Sally on the set.

		<shortDescription>A Peckinpah classic with substantial flaws</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of all things, Getaway is a very uneven effort by Sam Peckinpah that doesn't live up to its famous predecessors, The Wild Bunch (1969) and Straw Dogs (1971). With both, it shares the director's known liking for graphic violence (preferably using slow-motion gun shots) and queasy moral standards (that affect women and men alike), but too many flaws get in its way to make it a truly great thriller. The film opens with a very promising atmospheric prelude showing Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) grappling with the hardship of prison life. When his request for parole is rejected by the Prison Board, he summons his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) to barter an agreement with corrupt sheriff Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson) to get him released. The price to pay, or so it seems, is a bank robbery McCoy must carry out for Beynon's benefit. When McCoy learns that he will have to "work" with two of Beynon's men, his natural instinct tells him that he and his partner are in for trouble. Sure enough, things turn sour and McCoy is a man on the run. The main plot line is about deceit and suspicion. McCoy's near pathological mistrust in anyone crossing his way repeatedly saves his life but almost ruins it too, as it threatens to terminate his relationship with Carol as well. The film is served well by Peckinpah's utter lack of moralising impetus; the only things that make people tick in this movie are money and distrust (and, occasionally, sex; though that is more of an occupational gadget), and life is fundamentally a struggle against your next neighbour. Tellingly, redemption (a safe and proper life) lies beyond the border, in a fantasmagoric other territory, in this case Mexico, which in itself reeks of sarcasm. Though the main story has great moments in store, and the filming is spotless, the entire venture is at times obstructed by the overly caricatural subplot relating Rudy Butler's (Al Lettieri) chase of his one-day accomplice Doc. Aside from Quincy Jones' partly obnoxious soundtrack (and notwithstanding the eternal Toots Thieleman's harmonica spleen), another major defection in conjuring up the main protagonists' inner turmoil ? the only "ethical" point, if you will ? and give this film substance is MacGraw's sub-zero acting performance throughout. If she isn't a miscast, who is? And though McQueen turns in a standard no-kidding act, and most side acts certainly deserve a mention, nothing will do to bring life into the love plot. This in turn prevents the film from becoming a true 1970s Bonnie and Clyde journey, which would certainly have given it the edge it lacks. It is therefore no wonder that Getaway, unlike your classic crime romance, ends with a happy end ? be it a rather cold one, fitting in with the overall sentiment that pervades the film. But since it's a Peckinpah after all, you won't regret spending your money on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sam Peckinpah directs skillfully and gets the best out of his cast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is what's caper film is all about: tense, violent, sharp and smart. The action sequences is perfectly executed as one can expect from an action caliber like Peckinpah. I got to say those sequences (especially the shootout at the hotel) are pretty shocking considering this film was done back in 1972 where there still wasn't CGI technology. The acting is very good: Mcqueen really has a magnetizing screen presence and plays his king of cool perfectly. special credits have to go to Ben Johnson as a sleazy corrupt politician and maybe the most memorable is the late Al Lettieri as the double crossing Rudy Butler. Also watch for the truly cute Sally Struthers (Archie Bunker's daughter in the TV show). Those of you who looks for some rough and smart action film will not be disappointed of this classic.Recommended 10/10.</fullReview>

Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen are very good as a husband/wife team. The plot, with a nice twist or two, is fantastic...and even reasonably believable. Sam Peckinpah does a fine job in directing this thriller. And the excitement of the bank robbery, chases, and shootouts keeps you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end. The ending is really great. Slim Pickins and Sally Struthers play nice minor roles too. What's not to like? Don't let the 1972 release date scare you. It's so much better than the 1994 remake.

		<shortDescription>Gritty, realistic and gripping</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this film numerous times, including it's initial theatrical release in 1972. It remains a potent, gritty and realistic portrait of the lives of criminals, in the film-noir tradition (minus the requisite stylized photography of that genre). The heat and dust of the desert southwest is an almost palpable presence in unrelenting sun-scorched scenes. It is a simple, straightforward story with believable characters (some are slightly overplayed for emphasis). Others may disagree, but I believe that this was one of the outstanding films of the early 1970's, and it has never received the recognition it deserves. The 1994 remake copies it almost scene-for-scene, and this is a fitting homage to a great and largely under appreciated work. If the reader has seen neither of these, please view the original 1972 version first.</fullReview>

First: its a gritty movie and Ali McGraw in it is a gritty woman. Bony, all leggy angles and doe eyes and hard - like fashion models can be hard. And in love? Maybe..but more like desperately sexy and realizes that she has Doc and the chase (the dream) or a dentist, a Volvo and three kids with braces. Second: its a man's movie and Steve McQueen's the man. Third: Al Letteri plays a thug that is Steve McQueen's (Doc McCoy's) alter ego. He is Steve without Steve's style. Got it! Third: Sally Strothers goes completely over the top. Is there a better scene in movies that where she is screaming in the hotel and Doc decks her? Forth: Is there a better throw-away scene in a movie than the one with Al Letteri in the bathroom with Sally Strother's hanged husband.Fifth: Slim Pickins!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My first Peckinpah movie, and it's easy to understand how he became such a name filmmaker. Dude's a hard-nosed bastard. "The Getaway" has a sinister undercurrent from top to bottom. McQueen's a bank robber of the mean son-of-a-bitch variety, often berating and slapping around wife Ali McGraw (whose dubious acting ability is hard to miss). and then there's Sally Struthers, and if you've only known her from those '90s correspondence school commercials (as I do), you're in for a shock. Here, she's a chesty nympho. See what I mean? Stuff was crazy in the '70s. And then Slim Pickens shows up in a getaway ride (with an unexpectedly nice ending).It's not the greatest heist movie out there, but there's plenty of McQueen cool to keep one interested. And both the train chase and the ballsy shootout ending are quite memorable.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not among Peckinpah's finest, but entertaining nonetheless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Steve McQueen and director Sam Peckinpah re-team after their rodeo drama JUNIOR BONNER for this film adaptation of the Jim Thompson novel from a screenplay by Walter Hill (THE WARRIORS, 48 HRS.). McQueen plays master thief Doc McCoy who along with real-life wife Ali MacGraw find themselves double-crossed and chased to the Mexican border after pulling off a successful bank robbery.This 1972 hit revitalized the careers of McQueen and Peckinpah back to the forefront of bank-ability. What makes the film great are the locations filmed around Texas (BEST STATE EVER!!!) with locations ranging from the opening inside Huntsville State Prison to the climax at the El Paso border. There is nothing bad to say about this movie so far.The action is executed, the editing and cinematography is stylish and the eccentric performance by main baddie Al Lettieri is amazing. However, there are a few cons mostly due to Quincy Jones' above-average soundtrack. And it deserves a far better composer along the lines of Peckinpah collaborator Jerry Fielding or possibly Ennio Morricone. However, it is an entertaining heist/chase movie directed in a conventional, but true honest way that only Peckinpah can do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Immensely enjoyable self-conscious chase thriller, which seemingly deviates from its director's usual forté, but does in no way lag as a result.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With hindsight, it's interesting to note how people describe The Getaway as "minor" Peckinpah or through some sort of other word carrying with it a somewhat derogatory tinge; indeed, the makeup of the film, or its 'language', is indebted to a diverting away from an early aesthetic of rabid editing, a distorted use of sound over imagery plus a generality of the avant-garde, and into a more accessible, dare we we say more normalised, aesthetic of causality and other content generally not difficult to absorb. Such a shift in internal dynamic, quite literally within the body of the film, neatly echoes the overall switch from what people label Peckinpah's usual "oeuvre" and into something a little different, albeit more familiar, inclined to provide audiences with a piece adhering to generic convention or demand. Self reflexivity greets us upon dealing with The Getaway in this sense; a film with a reputation of being little more than a studio cash-in for Peckinpah and if such an item is true, then you might say is visually indicated in the above sense.The film follows two people, the lesser of several evils, and does a studious job in documenting their tribulations born out of the fallout of a money exchange which went wrong. Our peek into the life and times of these two leads, Steven McQueen's Carter McCoy and true to life as well as on-screen wife Carol, played by Ali MacGraw, echoes that of a female supporting act and her exposure to this existence of crime and chase when she and her husband are forced into tagging along across the depths of Texas. One might very well classify Peckinpah's film, indeed overall politic in regards to what plays out in The Getaway, as amoral - but his subplot of a hapless woman beginning life as a decent person (a veterinarian helping save lives very much earning money morally, no less) before coming around to be rather attuned to a sadistic gangster and his ways, acts as a devilish aside alluding to our own relationship-come-desire to 'will on' McQueen and MacGraw through this fallout of banditry and spilt blood. Mirroring the audience in regards to the two leads, this said supporting female, named Fran (Struthers), first observes her icons of gangsterdom and crime when they are in a state of near complete undress - a glimpsing of them at their barest and most vulnerable having just been put through a mill of hardship and strife on account of the sharp-mindedness of others in their field.The Getaway begins with a montage of rural wildlife; deer grazing, glancing up at the camera and then freezing as they look at us whilst the opening titles pause ? as if eerily in headlights. Then, we hear the unmistakable bark of a dog ? the idea of perhaps this, a hunting trip unfolding, dawning on us. No, it is a simple field beside a large prison and degrees of cold blooded hunting will transpire later. Carter is in prison; his credentials impressive, the outlining of who he is at a parole hearing reiterating precisely where his skills lie. The consequent rejection of parole places him in an unenviable position of having to work for a corrupt insider named Benyon (Johnson) or face an ongoing Hell of surplus routine and sexual frustration out of being away from his wife. It is precisely her sexuality that gets him out of prison, something which unfolds when she meets with Benyon to sort out his release ? her sporting of a dress designed to accentuate certain parts of her body whilst a jukebox plays music firmly instilling the scene with that of romance; her being leered at by Benyon's goons in the reception area an initial establishment of her scopophilic qualities.Where McCoy hears from Benyon on the job at hand is on a small barge floating down river as he lays everything out, its drifting beneath a bridge now and again briefly plunging proceedings into a shrouded, gloomy sort and away from the bright Texan light thus highlighting Benyon's corrupt, depraved, darkened characteristics which periodically rear up away from the surface 'light' as a prison official. He organises McCoy and two others, Rudi (Lettieri) and Frank (Hopkins), to rob a local bank for him; Rudy of whom recently worked with an old acquaintance of McCoy's who in his estimation was a good man at what he did, but who was killed only recently whilst operating with Rudy alluding to characteristics of the man that'll later become more apparent. McCoy's duelling with Rudi begins with an argument on real-life gangster John Dillenger, the third male member of their troupé falling away from the generality of hard-edged and hard-bodied proceedings when McCoy catches him out and berates him as if a school-child for not paying enough attention during an important meeting over how the robbery will be executed.Peckinpah's film doesn't so much glamorise crime as much detail a chapter in the lives of numerous bodies more broadly linked to it; all of this, before offering a quintessential resolution within which the outcome is only as nihilistic as it is when lined up against other realistic outcomes. Is the spectator pleased with the conclusion to the similarly structured 2008 film No Country for Old Men because a set-behavioural pattern is quintessentially demonised? Or ought the labelling of it as a 'happy' ending fall to deaf ears when we realise only one of a handful of evil parties were ever going to make it out of such a scenario with the prize anyway ? most of them scummier than certain others, but each of them essentially scummy in their own right. Regardless, The Getaway is a taut and exciting self-reflective thriller; a pleasant excursion from "normal" Peckinpah - a dogged film about two dogged characters sticking out a series of grimy misadventures in what is ultimately a grotty, unglamourous portrait of chase and law-evading on top of an exciting film-watching experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Peckinpah and Walter Hill combine to create gritty, memorable crime thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really, really love Walter Hill. Sure, he's not the most consistent writer (or director, for that matter) on the planet, but his best work has a wonderful sort of gritty charm. Sam Peckinpah is probably the best choice to direct a typical 70's Walter Hill script other than, well, Walter Hill himself. "The Getaway" is a massively entertaining crime thriller, a blisteringly fast-paced showcase for Peckinpah's distinctive style and for the sort of morally ambiguous script that Hill writes so well. "The Getaway" is tremendously entertaining, sure, but it is also really gritty and far, far removed from the standard glitzy fluff that makes up the majority of heist films.Something like "The Getaway" has to feature performances that leave an impression for it to work. The characters, which Hill's script focuses on enough but doesn't obsess over, need to be believable for one to care about what is happening to them. How many times have you watched a mildly entertaining heist flick and ultimately come away from it not caring even remotely about what just happened? "The Getaway" doesn't just have the right amount of depth and grit script-wise, it also features a confident and mature performance from Steve McQueen, who plays a morally ambiguous anti-hero in this film. It's one of his better performances, I think, and one of the better characters he played. The rest of the cast are all good as well.The action is great, as one can expect from Peckinpah. The final shootout is especially memorable and McQueen just looks great with that rifle. This is the sort of screen presence most 'movie stars' could only hope to have. Peckinpah's handling of the quieter scenes is equally strong, and the film moves at a blinding pace. I could barely believe it was two hours long. "The Getaway" is a tremendous crime thriller. On my first viewing I didn't take to it, but six viewings later and it's one of my favorite crime films from the 70's. Really well-acted, well-directed, and well-written film, and one which is simultaneously one of the decade's most involving and entertaining features and one of its grittiest heist films. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen-MacGraw great pair in this 70's chase movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only knew of Sam Peckinpah for his violent movie themes. I saw "Straw Dogs" many years ago and found it a satisfying movie but was unimpressed by its violent ending. This movie, on the other hand, shows another side to Peckinpah. The prison life is depicted as a hell of regimentation. The watchtower is shown as the camera moves upward toward the armed guard above watching over the inmates. Inside the institution, Doc McCoy's request for parole is handled as another rubber stamp decision that leaves him angry and humiliated. At this point, Carol McCoy springs into action and at Doc's urging arranges his release by selling herself to one of the prison authorities, the corrupt Ben Johnson. The relationship between McQueen and MacGraw (Carol and Doc McCoy)is skilfully handled. McCoy's first taste of freedom is blended into a scene where the two stop at a riverbank and find children swimming and couples kissing and lunching. There is an illusion of the two of them jumping into the water and hugging one another, as the scene switches back to the two looking on from the riverbank. Soon,the two are together in the water and embrace one another for the first time in four years. The relationship is rekindled as the movie progresses. It is a true love match. There is a setback at one low point in the movie where McCoy,out of anger,becomes physical with his wife but they manage to get their act together again.Because of the deal to get McCoy out of prison, the two become part of a robbery which leads to the chase scene and much killing along the way. The action is totally escapist as they take possession of $3/4 million and avoid their pursuers and the police from one scene to another in rapid succession. Even though they are forced to kill almost everyone in their path, we root for them at every step of the way. Sally Struthers, of All in the Family TV fame, is pressed into action on the side of the villains. She plays her role to the hilt and is funny and ridiculous at the same time. Slim Pickens provides great comic touch near the end of the movie. Interestingly, the many gunshots that are peppered into numerous bodies do not show the blood and gore you would find in today's cinema. It is a thrilling chase and this movie did not disappoint.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Doc McCoy is released from jail through connections who cross and get crossed as McCoy and his wife Carol look to make it to safety with a suitcase of cash.Sam Peckinpahs 1972 crime drama is in his second tier of quality along with films like Cross of Iron and Ballard of Cable Hogue that is to say not Wild Bunch but still very damned good. The lean, mean environment and amoral characters are well matched, in truth you'd do well to avoid both. That includes our two "heroes" who, while they are given a touch more humanity at appropriate moments are also ready to kill at the drop of a stetson.Peckinpahs regular lensman veteran Lucien Ballard gives The Getaway a feel that is both vivid and washed-out as his cameras survey the flat grey Texan vistas, stucco walls and (often) splintered wood paneling. The trademark cross-cut/slow-mo editing still pleases in concert with Quincy Jones fragmented score which, like that for Dollars (1971) makes interesting use of voices as instrument sounds.I have not seen the remake but I can only imagine that any comparison would only make this version look all the better, Alec Baldwin v Steve McQueen? Nah I didn't think so!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of my favorite films of all time. And I don't typically love violent movies. Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw define glamor in this movie. Yes, the violence is a little hard to watch, and the bad guy is ugly enough to make viewers uncomfortable, but the relationship between the two leads, the inventiveness of the plot, and the way the tension is kept up through the whole movie kept me spellbound. Best moment comes at the beginning of the movie...McQueen is let out of jail and his wife is late picking him up. She says something like "where do you want to go" and he responds, "anywhere, just out". You can feel the jail time McQueen has been through, and the bond he and his wife share. Also, McGraw's clothes are fabulous throughout and she is beautiful to watch. I didn't mind her acting at all in this. I was simply riveted by the two of them. Take my word for it, the remake is simply embarrassing to watch after this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve McQueen, THE MAN!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After "Wild Bunch" and before "Bring me the head of Alfredo Garcia" the outlaw Peckinpah filmed another one of his border stories, full of sweat, violence and desert dust. This time we got this couple (Steve McQueen and Alice McGraw) that are trying to escape from the police and from a group of gangsters after a hold-up in a bank. It's a kind of Texan version of "Bonnie &amp; Clyde"."The getaway" has the advantage of the amazing presence of Mr. MacQueen, and all those amoral and misogynist characters that look like they come from the most stinking sewer of deep America. The weak points are Ali McGraw (I never liked her, neither as an actress nor as a woman), the lack of rhythm (for a movie like this) and an ending that's not as explosive as "Wild Bunch" one.It's not the best Sam Peckinpah's movie, but it's still a good film.*My rate: 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always enjoy watching "The Getaway" with Steve McQueen &amp; Ali McGraw. They're both superb actors and the chemistry between them needs no explanation. McQueen is one of the few actors who can do a real Texas accent and I sure miss him to this day. Sometimes I see Ali McGraw in the grocery store and she only looks a year or two older than she did in 1972. Sally Struthers' character is fun to watch as she is a the antithesis of her 'Gloria' character on "All in the Family." If you look closely when McQueen is buying the radio you'll see John Ratzenburger as the news announcer on the TVs in the sporting good store.Watch "The Getaway" to see a piece of 1970s Americana, to see the two lead actors work so naturally together, to see lots of extras who later become famous, to see a fun bandit flick or to see Ali McGraw &amp; Steve McQueen frolicking out of the city dump. For whatever reason, just watch "The Getaway."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Steve McQueen is Carter 'Doc' McCoy a prison inmate. After he's paroled after his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) sleeps with the warden, the warden makes another stipend on Doc's parole. He must help rob a bank. But when that goes sour, he finds himself on the run from both the police as well as a co-robber. All the actors in this film are pitch perfect. The action is great and the film is VERY enjoyable. I hesitate to call it my favorite McQueen film, because he made some amazing movies (such as "The Magnificent Seven", "Bullitt", and "The Thomas Crown Affair), but this film is definitely up there. Furthermore for some reason I always hate whatever characters Sally Struthers plays in the various roles she got. Don't know what's up with that.My Grade: A- DVD Extras: Commentary by Peckinpah biographers/documentarians Paul Seydor, Garner Simmons and David Weddle; Second commentary with cobbled recordings of Sam Peckinpah, Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw; and Theatrical trailer</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are two Peckinpah Movies almost everybody knows and seems to like. The Wild Bunch and The Getaway. The first one is truly one of the greatest movies in history, whilst the latter is... good. Some of the sequences are really excellent, the camera works well, the story is not new but fairly interesting. The biggest problem of the film is it´s cast. McQueen is o.k., but no Eastwood or Coburn and McGraw was truly not the best actress around. Al Lettieri is terrible as the main villain of the movie. Peckinpahs stock actors Ben Johnson and Slim Pickens are good as always, but Johnson dies too early and Pickens just shows up for a short dialouge. Apart from that there aren´t any other flaws, except that Peckinpah made some better movies. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Getaway is a great film. Generally the pace is fairly easy going, but when violence ensues it changes dramatically and Peckinpah lets us have it with very tense and bloody set pieces. It is also very amusing, some of the scenes with Rudy and Fran are ridiculously funny. Cracking performances by the enigmatic McQueen and MacGraw, both make a very believable pair of strong willed criminals. Both are broody people of few words, yet are intelligent and controlled, and ruthless. Also MacGraw is absolutely gorgeous in this. Don't watch wannabe Tarantino imitations, and don't listen to people who say rip offs like True Romance are better, The Getaway was there first and is superior in every way. A tense, gritty, understated classic. If you are fed up with the majority of dirge that Hollywood churns out these days, go and get a copy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. I've seen some good films but I didn't enjoy many of them as much as this. That includes Convoy, Bullitt, Good the Bad and the Ugly, and most other retro classics - modern films don't count here cause it's not relative. Anyway, McQueen gives a fantastic performance as Doc McCoy and really was very cool and watchable. Ali McGraw was perfect for his wife cause she's cool too and her performance was gritty and intelligent. Peckinpah is super cool and makes this film into a masterpiece. Love the whole feel of the movie, from start to end. Al Lettieri as Rudy was just great as the bad guy and helped to make this into a classic. A great heist movie that is truly fascinating. Great music as well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve &amp; Ali</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How can it get any better than Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw in an anti-establishment fable directed by Sam Peckinpah? What makes the film so excellent, in addition to its well-crafted, well-directed and mostly well-acted story, is the use of location filming, tense chase scenes that give us action-action- action...and a smattering of supporting players (many having found greater fame on television by the time they were cast in these roles) that give the story flavor, energy and colorful characterization. Among these folks, I want to mention Jack Dodson as a hostage forced to drive; Dub Taylor as a seedy motel manager; Slim Pickens as a cowboy; and of course, Sally Struthers as Fran, a wannabe Bonnie Parker whose heart inevitably gets broken on the run. Struthers should have had a supporting actress nomination, because she is that good. Do not miss the rib-throwing scene about two-thirds of the way through the movie. It's classic.As for the leads, I understand they fell in love during the making of this picture and divorced their respective spouses to marry each other. To say they share a special chemistry is underestimating the laws of physical attraction. I expected MacGraw to be a bit of a pushover, but she is given some powerful moments where her character explodes and gets exploded at. She is deceptively calm and then when she faces a crisis, we are wondering how she will react, and if she will ever fully self-destruct. McQueen is perfectly cool, and there is a great scene where the runaway couple emerges from a pile of trash that has been dumped along a gulch in a remote waste site. In this scene, we see him stand up, grab the bag of money and his rifle, then move off with MacGraw as only he can. Nothing rumples him. In fact, nothing rumples this movie. It's as crisp as a new twenty-dollar bill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that this is 'Steve' being 'Steve!' I don't believe that there was even any discussion as to who would star in this movie...anymore than there was the chance that Steve McQueen had to test for the role.As in most of Steve McQueen's 'anti-hero' roles ("Soldier In The Rain;" "Baby, The Rain Must Fall;" "The Cincinnati Kid;" "The Sand Pebbles;" "Bullit;" etc.), this role fit him like a glove...and, even better than the others, as with this movie, the sky was the limit! Steve could be as bad as he wanted to be - and, the badder the better! This has to be the best bank robbery, shoot-em-up film ever made (this, and, "The Wild Bunch"), both directed by Sam Peckinpah.Teaming Steve McQueen with director Sam Peckinpah was as monumental as teaming Lennon and McCartney; Stewart and Fonda; Tracy and Hepburn; or, Bogie and Bacall! It was magic!I saw this at the theater in 1972 with my Dad, and, it hasn't lost anything over all of those years.It's simply a great, dramatic, and, realistic movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A minor classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway is the 1972 box office smash that featured legendary director Sam Peckinpah at his stylish best and capitalized on the off- the-charts chemistry between Steve McQueen and his new bride at the time, Ali MacGraw.McQueen plays Doc McCoy, a recently released-from-jail career criminal who is coerced into a bank robbery by the crooked warden (Ben Johnson), aided by his wife, Carol (Ali MacGraw) and his old crew. When things go wrong at the robbery, including the death of one of Doc's men (Bo Hopkins) and when another crew member (Al Lettieri) turns on the McCoys, it forces the couple on the run.Peckinpah's nearly flawless eye for cinematic violence is one of the things that makes this film so completely watchable. Watch the scene where McQueen levels a police car with a shot gun...Peckinpah once again makes the art of cinematic violence look almost musical...like a slow- motion ballet. Very few directors have accomplished as much over the years with the art of slow motion as Sam Peckinpah. Mention should also be made of a hair-raising scene that takes place on a garbage truck that the McCoys are forced to hide in.Despite MacGraw's limited acting skills, there is no denying the white hot chemistry she had with the late McQueen. Ben Johnson is appropriately slimy as the warden and Al Lettieri is bone-chilling and works well with Sally Struthers, who plays the innocent housewife who becomes his hostage.The film was remade in 1994 with Alex Baldwin and Kim Basinger, but as I usually say in reviews like this one, stick with the original. An instant classic that has great re-watch appeal, even almost fifty years after its original release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better than Bullet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is something about The Getaway that makes me like it more than more famous Steve Mcqueen films such as Bullet and The Great Escape ' which is strange because this film is far from perfect.The story is an age old one, A robbery goes wrong and the instigators go on the run from the police and other criminals who are after a cut.This film was not spliced together very well , it jumps all over the place and the dialogue is not too good .There are plenty of moments where nothing is said and to be honest they are the best scenes. Sam Peckinpah does not seem to be the most accomplished director but really , when you have Mcqueen and MacGraw on show , most people wont notice. Their on screen chemistry is superb which is not surprising as they fell in love on set and later married. There does seem to be a constant air of sexism bordering on Masogonism in this film , something you don't see to often in older films. Another thing that you realise when watching the car chases is how difficult the American cars were to handle. Nevertheless , Steve Mcqueen looks like he's in his element.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pulp Fiction at its most authentic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not so familiar with Sam Peckinpah's career as I have only seen this and The Osterman Weekend (which I hated) but you can tell from his style that he has certainly influenced a lot of modern day directors. The perfect widescreen photography, quick editing (but not a blur, I should add) and dramatic use of slow-motion give the action in The Getaway an authentic edge. And all done on a low-budget too.Adapted from a Jim Thompson novel by Walter Hill (his macho characteristics are all in there), the story has newly-freed jailbird Carter McCoy forced into a bank robbery by crime boss Jack Benyon. He's also forced to work with rank amateur Frank and psychotic renegade Rudy. You can tell that this dost not bode well.Rudy goes haywire, killing everyone in sight but is soon put out of action by McCoy, who then legs it across country with his cheating wife (the lovely Ali McGraw) and a bag full of simoleons. Down, but not out, Rudy follows him, as well as several associates of the recently deceased Jack Benyon, not to mention loads of cops.The film is basically one action scene after the other but it doesn't pretend to be anything other than tough-guy entertainment. I find it bizarre that this film is rated PG in America and the exact same version is rated 18 in the UK. But the blood effects in the film are pretty damn fake so it does take it out of reality a little bit. Plus there are no (audible) F-words and the nudity is minimum and quick.I saw the 1994 remake first and while it's passable it's not really as rustic and straight-forward as this. It was quite a pointless film and virtually identical, shot-for-shot. Everything that The Getaway has to offer is done best in this one. Unpretenious fun indeed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My advice to readers for The Getaway, it's great, go buy it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched The Getaway again this evening, and spent considerable time reading the reviews here, good and bad. My advice to the reader is, if you do not have this DVD movie in your collection of action movies, and you see it in a store, buy it regardless of the price. If it's a rental you will definitely not want to take it back. I have most of Peckinpah's films and this is my #2 favourite after The Wild Bunch. McQueen is the thinking man he was in Bullitt, and ex model Ali McGraw looks beautiful even when she is hurled out of the back of a garbage truck, the romance and chemistry between the pair is very sensitive and believable, with Quincy Jones music featuring legendary harmonica player Toots Thielemans. Perhaps he played at their wedding, they were married 5 yrs immediately after this movie. I do not think it was a shotgun wedding. The movie is a lot about shotguns. The cast is outstanding along with Brando's protégé Al Lettieri, Slim Pickens, Ben Johnson. It is after all a story of violence amongst bank robbers and corrupt cops, exciting car chases of course, with famed stuntman McQueen teaching Ali McGraw how to drive and shoot. I nevertheless love this Peckinpah film. I liked seeing them together Steve Mc Queen and Ali McGraw, and I really wish we could see something like it today in our movie theaters.

		<fullReview>"The Getaway" became a part of a Hollywood legend.First of all, thanks to its stars - Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. As an on-screen couple they had together such a warm feeling that they got married off-stage. Second of all, it is because a great romance has been written in a specific for the director's poetic of violence. San Peckinpah awaken the ghost of traditional Hollywood in a movie closer to "the new American cinema" than to the black cinema of the 40's and 50's. That is where are the origins of "The Getaway". Third aspect is that Sam Peckinpah was approximately the first director of the new direction of Hollywood. He openly tried to use the abolition of Hays' code. His movies were filled with a load of violence unparalleled before. "The Getaway" refers to that rule as well. It supposed to be a kind of a crook tale, where interactions with violence were treated as an element of fun.An experienced thief is released from prison. He must pay for his freedom by getting involved into another heist. Despite the many complications, the bank gets robbed and the main character has nothing left to do, but taking care of disloyal partners and the police. And his must forgive his wife an affair. However, it was her submission that set him free. Then he can drive away giving satisfaction to himself and the audience who are getting to like the characters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll be honest this is the second Pickentah movie I've seen . The first one being "The Wild Bunch" (naturaly) . While I found that one a bit too over the top in terms of action scenes , here Peckintah succeeds in giving us a stellar performance without the need of a high body count.The movie stars Steve Mcqueen as Carter "Doc" McCoy . Recently released from prison thanks to his wife Carol McCoy played by Ali MacGraw and hired to rob a bank . Needless to say something goes wrong and Doc finds himself in a series of double crossings causing him to be chased by the police and his former employers."The Getaway" perfectly blends the action and thriller genre, creating a very intense always on the edge and never knowing what to expect next atmosphere. The chemistry between Mcqueen and MacGraw works, with both characters sympathetic and memorable in their own way. Mcqueen delivers one of his best performances with his down to earth charismatic look, he doesn't need to say anything, the viewer can understand him just by the way he reacts or looks during a certain situation. That strong presence makes the movie all the more enjoyable as the audience is able to believe that McQueen is a professional thief. Director Sam Peckintah's use of slow-motion and destructible environments unlike most modern movies isn't over used keeping the movie's tone to a much more realistic and also enjoyable level. Also noticeable is the presence of a sub-plot involving one of the main antagonists, giving us a greater and much more in-depth knowledge of the people trying to kill McCoy.With at an all out great performance by it's cast and crew "The Getaway" is sure to deliver a memorable two hour watch to any fan of the genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Master thief Doc McCoy ( Steve McQueen) knows his wife, Carol ( Ali MacGraw) has been in bed with the local political boss in order to spring him from jail. But, what he can't know is the sinister succession of double-crosses that will soon sour the deal once he's on the ouside-and executing the perfect robbery.Directed by Sam Peckinpah, The Getaway simply like it's star, redefined what it meant to be 'cool.' With breathless intensity, and oozing sex appeal, the film was filmed on location across Texas and in sequence-from the opening inside Hunstville State Prison to the explosive El Paso border climax. I think my favorite scene from the film is the whole sequence that takes place in the Amtrack station, in which the one guy tricks Carol by switching keys at the locker. I also loved the scene where the same guy is all proud of himself for what he has done, and he's all sitting on the train, proud of himself, and then McCoy beats the crap out of him. Sally Struthers character. What an annoying character! And damn that guy who played Rudy was creepy as hell.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great - Unless You Have Read the Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a highly entertaining film, but its conclusion has no connection with either the plot or the themes of the original novel. Happy, or even nearly happy, endings are almost nonexistent in Jim Thompson's novels, but someone, presumably Steve McQueen, the producers and financiers, felt competent to impose a traditional "triumph (sort of) of young (sort of) love." Doing this is comparable to letting Hester Prynn tell the busybodies off in "The Scarlet Letter" or imposing an improbably heroic ending on "The Natural" - yes, it can be done, but it undercuts what the author was trying to say. In the case of those other adaptations of novels to the screen, the originals were well enough known that such dissonances were obvious, and such was reported in reviews (moreso for "The Scarlet Letter," which was a bad film on any terms, than for "The Natural," which was, like "The Getaway," good unless you knew what had been done to the original material.)Well, the primary requirement of a film is that it entertain on its own terms: I give it an 8, with the understanding that the novel's bleak end would have been not only depressing to the audience, but probably a bear to film. As is often the case, Jim Thompson's ending signifies more the deranged and deteriorated mind of the protagonist than any easily depicted "reality." Perhaps I would have found a faithful rendition of Thompson's original work less satisfying than this. McQueen is great, as are Ben Johnson, Al Lettieri and most of the supporting cast. Ali McGraw is a very limited actress, but I thought more of her performance here than a lot of viewers: She got the job done and made Ben Johnson's double dealing completely understandable.</fullReview>

There are some exciting chase sequences and, eventually, the obligatory shootout, but there's a slick quality to most of the movie that put me off. Worst of all, the central relationship between Doc (Steve McQueen) and his wife (Ali MacGraw) is completely unconvincing, and much of the dialogue is laughable. The subplot involving Doc's double-crossing partner forcing the Sally Struthers character and her milquetoast husband to drive him across Texas in pursuit of Doc and Carol is the best (funniest, most disturbing) part of the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Existential horrors in gritnik action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame that an actor like Steve McQueen, obsessed with maintaining an image, is allowed final cut here. Whenever the camera settles on him I feel like I'm called to admire the impenetrable cool exterior of the silent action hero. In a Leone film this works, here sometimes it doesn't. This is of course McQueen's fault but Peckinpah must still share the brunt of the commercial action film McQueen thinks he's making. Stephen King said about the Peckinpah film that "if you have seen only the film version of The Getaway, you have no idea of the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where Sam Peckinpah ended the story". I'm incredibly intrigued about that final chapter left out by the movie, something about the couple on the run arriving at a den of iniquity in Mexico no doubt to enact their parts in a tragedy, just the same though I can still recognize existential horrors in Peckinpah's film that make me fear for the characters' souls.I love it when we get the cracks in the mask. When for example, in the opening prison sequence, Peckinpah freezes McQueen clutching his face with both hands in a portrait of anguish and despair. Without any more words needed, I can see why this man will step out to meet his wife in the following scene telling her to go to the sheriff and ask him his price, not even knowing yet that the price is not only his own price to be fixed and gambled upon in a game of chance but also a price which can never be paid back in full. This is the existential horror for me, a life changed in the chance toss of the coin or the flip of the card. When McQueen becomes frustrated with the game of chess he's playing with an old prison inmate and strikes at the pawns, the old man tells him that "it's just a game". Ali McGaw later reminds him, among mounds of garbage, that it's all a game. But a game can only be as real as the stakes. In this sense I'm very glad Sam Fuller never got to make the picture instead of Peckinpah. Peckinpah knows fatalism in the bottle of his whiskey, and in this movie he tells us that some things can never be made right again.I hear a lot of people have a problem with Ali McGraw. She's a good reason why I can love this film and Convoy. Here, unlike McQueen, we see the cracks in the mask. I don't like Meryl Streeps. I like my actresses to be like my favourite actors, at their most profound to be mute faces that say all there is to be said. I love the expressive eyes here, she gives a terrific performance even as (or perhaps precisely because) she doesn't quite know how to give one. I feel that a lesser actress who hasn't yte mastered the art of pretending to be other persons can't help but reveal glimmers of personal truth. How terrifying then to know that McQueen did beat up Ali McGraw in real life and then turn to look at the pain in her eyes, this almost an act of prophecy, of how much she would be hurt if the man she loves did actually strike at her.The fascinating thing in this on screen relationship which after a hiatus four years long must be resumed on the run, inside beatup cars, fleabag motels and driveins, even inside garbage trucks, is that it's as likely to last forever as it is for them to break up the next moment and go their separate ways. In an almost unthinkable manner for a Peckinpah film, The Getaway is not just about an end to a world, it's also about new beginnings. This is not Peckinpah's natural environment though, so we don't get what it takes for that new beginning to be made possible. Surely it's more than a matter of gunning down deputies and giving out $30k for a beatup truck, but we don't quite arrive at the meaningful point of departure. This is not the gritnik poetry that is Alfredo Garcia, but as gritnik cinema it's near the top looking down.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Bonnie &amp; Clyde" for the 70's...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Latter-day "Bonnie &amp; Clyde" fable with Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw taking the leads in Sam Peckinpah's typically brutal, uncompromising heist / road movie.A meandering but nonetheless action-packed story of moral redemption, the conclusion here differs from Arthur Penn's earlier classic by granting the McQueen/McGraw characters survival at the end, their personal differences apparently resolved, as they head on into Mexico to start presumably a new life on the proceeds of the botched "thieves-fall-out" bank job they pulled at the start of the movie. If that upbeat conclusion jars a little, that's probably because Penn got the better ending first in his movie, but also because, by the end of their tortuous journey, both physical and spiritual, you still don't feel that either of them, for all their star-playing, are admirable or likable people. Some villains you actually don't want to get away and I'd have been quite happy, based on the preceding evidence in the movie, if the two of them had got some sort of come-uppance at the end.For a heist film to work requires a premium of cool which of course is second nature to McQueen who is fine in his usual laconic way, even if his "method" delivery highlights the one-dimensionality of his character. I actually quite liked McGraw's performance as the doe-eyed beauty who doesn't shirk from sleeping with Mr Big, (Kenyon) to ensure McQueen gets his early parole release and then shooting him in cold blood, just as McQueen learns this, to prefigure the killing spree which later follows. Her part must have been very physically demanding and she holds up well, even if she does seem a little young for the part (but then of course life imitated art, as the screen couple became real-life lovers, so what do I know about compatibility?!).There are many effective sequences, the opening, almost silent scene-setting at the prison as McQueen's frustrated "Doc" concludes he'll pay any price to get out (thus setting up McGraw for her fall), the episode where McQueen's retrieves the case with the money on board the train, after McGraw's been conned by a shyster, (very crisply done, with hardly any graphic violence), the scene in the compactor where the on-the-run couple are literally up to their necks in it and finally their fortunate encounter with a frankly wacky Slim Pickens who drives them across the border like a Duke of Hazzard five years too soon.Less savoury are the scenes where the treacherous gang-member Rudy, hot on Doc &amp; his missus' trail, kidnaps a young doctor and his slatternly wife and then proceeds to tie up the poor guy and make him watch their love-making. Perhaps this is the old "Straw Dog" Peckinpah returning to its own vomit, but I found it completely distasteful and gratuitous, never mind demeaning to women, even in context. A fine performance by the way, perhaps the best on show, delivered almost mute in fact, by Jack Dodson as the hapless husband.The much-parodied "slow-motion ballet" which characteristically accompanies the extreme violence in most of Peckinpah's films is either effective or played out depending on your perception of Peckinpah's art (I think I tend to the former on this occasion, it's pretty well rendered here) and there's no arguing with his depiction of little-town America, including for example, its corrupt police force and also shopkeepers who'll unblinkingly sell you a shotgun for spot cash.In conclusion then, a tough, very adult movie with no soft underbelly, not easy to watch, but not easy to stop watching either...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good McQueen vehicle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't a big McQueen fan, but if I were to pick my favorite of his, it would be Bullitt and The Getaway. The Getaway relies more on action and a little hard core violence. Pretty tame by today's standards , but still packs a punch. I also like 70's films and this has that old 70's charm that we never see anymore. I also thought the minimal use of dialog between McQueen and MacGraw was correct, because it allowed the intensity of the relationship to build in that subtle and non-verbal way with good uses of dramatic pauses. People often berated MacGraw for her weak acting, and it's true she was never a great actress. But here, Peckinpah utilizes her wooden performance to its advantage and somehow makes it look believable. A great director can turn any performance from a woman into something good. Favorite scenes were when Rudy gets shot and is wearing a bullet proof vest. Also, when McQueen purchases a 12-Gauge shot gun over the counter, is a classic scene for gun aficionados. Sally Struthers getting slapped and the chase scenes. This is good entertainment, regardless of what ever became of McQueen or MacGraw in real life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There was a 1994 remake of this which wasn't too bad, but the original is the best. The Getaway is a brilliant crime film, full of shotgun action and a few exciting car chases. There are also a couple of slow-mo shootout scenes which really capture the moment and add a great deal to the film. The script is sharp and the acting on song. McQueen plays the part with his usual subtlety and cool, whilst MacGraw doesn't follow the route of so many leading ladies in being very annoying, but is actually a character you like. The start is a tad slow, but the rest of the film is nicely paced and whilst a little dated nowadays its still one of the best crime movies available. One to buy in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Getaway(1972) was the second film Sam Peckinpah did with Steve Mcqueen after Junior Bonner(1972) and perhaps not the best. There are some good moments in the picture that make it a good film. One, the opening credits with some terrific montage. Two, the botched bank robbery. Three, the garbage truck sequence. Four, the gun fight in slow motion near the end.Based on a novel by pulp fiction arthor Jim Thompson, The Getaway(1972) lacks any of the interesting parts of his novel. Not as good as other films based on Jim Thompson's work like The Grifters(1991). In the manner of They Live by Night, You Only Live Once, Gun Crazy, and Bonnie &amp; Clyde. The acting varies from actor to actor. Sam Peckinpah did the best he could with an average script. I have a feeling that if Peckinpah wrote some of the screenplay then the movie might have been beter than it turned out to be. The director's next film would be the magificent if slightly flawed Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid(1973).The story is adequetely written by Walter Hill. He would reuse portions of the gun battle scene at the hotel during the first few moments of 48 Hours(1982). In fact the scene where Doc Mccoy tells his wife to stall the person that's outside his door is too similar to the one in 48 Hours(1982). The chemistry of Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw is average and inconsistent. Al Lettieri is the best actor in the film with his sadistic and slimy performance as the double crossing Rudy Butler. He almosts carrys the entire film on his back with his impressive performance.Ben Johnson is very good in the role of Jack Beynon. The cinematography of Lucien Ballard is one of the film's few bright spots. Ali MacGraw is just below average and not good at all in giving a convincing performance. The action scenes with the slow mo shoot ouys are the few things that are pure Peckinpah. The director did not have final cut because the main actor decided to have the film edit himself thus making the film good if not average. The Getaway(1972) is a film that's in need of the director'c cut treatment which restores the film to the original vision of Sam Peckinpah.</fullReview>

It also has (for those of you just like me) one of the greatest shootouts in movie history. If you like Steve McQueen as much as I do, don't miss this one.

		<fullReview>If you have to choose between two excellent Steve McQueen movies, Peter Yates' "Bullitt" and Sam Peckinpah's "The Getaway" I recommend you should definitely go for this one. Not that I think there's something awfully wrong with good old "Bullitt". It's a terrific classic and I like it very much. But I love "The Getaway". I just happen to think that this is a damn great piece of entertainment with McQueen having the time of his life in a leading role. Very cool acting, very gripping story and extremely well-done action scenes that shows Peckinpah at his best. I understand that Roger "Dante's Peak" Donaldson directed a remake of "The Getaway" over 20 years later. I haven't seen it but it's hard to figure it could ever been even as half as good as this one. Watch this thriller masterpiece now.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You'll be back, Doc."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Action-filled crime-drama, expertly assembled by director Sam Peckinpah and screenwriter Walter Hill, adapting Jim Thompson's novel, has Steve McQueen's incarcerated "Doc" McCoy asking his pretty wife to use her feminine wiles with a corrupt Texas parole board member in getting him released; it works, on the condition that Doc partner with two of the businessman's henchman in robbing a neighborhood bank--but things don't go as planned. After a brilliantly designed and edited prologue with McQueen doing time behind bars, this heist flick becomes more routine, with noisy gunfire and police sirens and cars smashing and crashing into everything. McQueen holds the screen with his charismatic, laconic presence, but Ali MacGraw is little more than window dressing (and when she is required to emote, she's open-mouthed and vacuous); taken together, they're not an overly exciting or interesting pair. Subplot with hostage Sally Struthers is mean and nasty, and Peckinpah's florid handling is undeniably potent and gripping. Quincy Jones' score (added at the 11th hour) and Lucien Ballard's cinematography are also first-rate. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Wild Bunch (1969), Straws Dogs (1971), and The Getaway (1972), One Could Say Director Sam Peckinpah was On a Roll. With a Tumultuous Career of Ups and Downs, Peckinpah had Made His Mark in TV Westerns in the Fifties and Directed One of the Best Westerns Ever, Ride the High Country (1962). Then Sam Got a Reputation for Over-Indulgence, Over-Budget Movies and was Virtually Black-Listed After He Lost Millions and Control of the Final Cut on Major Dundee (1964).He Didn't Work for Years and Then was Given a Chance to Do "The Wild Bunch" and the Rest is History. Not the Most Prolific of Directors and Not Very Consistent, His Films Waiver in Quality From Great to OK, but None of His Films are Objectively Bad. "The Getaway" was His Biggest Commercial Film, No Doubt Helped by the Box Office Appeal of Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. But the Film is So Much More than the Egomaniac McQueen and the No-Talent McGraw. It is a Violent, Funny, Romantic Road Picture with Criminal Lovers on the Lam.There are Numerous Set-Pieces that are Highly-Entertaining Between the Squibs and the Slow-Motion Violence. The Opening Prison Sequence, the Bank Robbery, the Hotel Shootout, the Hostages, the Train Sequence, the Garbage Truck Escape, the Town Confrontation with Police, and a Viewer Friendly Ending.This is Top-Tier Peckinpah and Top-Tier McQueen, Helped by a Walter Hill Script from a Jim Thompson Novel, with a Fine Supporting Cast of Bo Hopkins, Al Literati, Sally Struthers, Ben Johnson, Jack Dodson, Dub Taylor, Slim Pickins and Others. The Score from Quincy Jones has its Supporters and Detractors but is Fits Finely in the Proceedings.Note...The 1994 Remake is a mediocre Movie. It is best left unseen until after this one, because it is done virtually scene for scene and is an unremarkable copy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great looking fast-paced thriller,above the average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway is one of the greatest looking thrillers ever.It is very well paced,and its fast pace makes it suspenseful and interesting.It is extremely compact?and McQueen also is very compact.And it does not insult the intelligence, although the plot simply does not exist, it is reduced to a minimum of things.An interesting no-nonsense movie with plenty of straightforward action is not this good by chance;it is so good because someone knew how to make it. Peckinpah was this man,and McQueen was again the right lead.Although I have seen this movie before,and several times its Basinger remake,when I saw it this time it was a moment when,not remembering the end,I was wondering whether they will finally make it or not. So I guess the story is somehow unpredictable,though minimal as concerns the originality.Then there is this stench of imbecility and illiterate base brutes and this odor of violent churlishness,of uncouthness, undomesticated by the fancy nuances that some noir movies used?all the SP movies that I know have it?this ungenerous conception?but then it rightly belongs to the world shown?one of the most unattractive film worlds ?--this unclean world of blunt negations ?.The filthiness, the sleazy dingy vulgar life this characters have is certainly more shocking than the violence denounced by the philistines. You see,"Doc" is undaunted and undismayed?but he is not legendary,he is not larger-than-life.His life is part of this prosaic fresco of ugliness.This is the most violent thing in SP's movies?the ugliness of the lives,the emptiness,the void?completely assumed and fairly represented.In "Getaway",there is the band of boors and cads that hunt Doc.The plot could not have been more rudimentary. In a few words, Peckinpah was a competent director of thrillers,westerns (and the related sub-genres?e.g., The Ballad of Cable Hogue and Junior Bonner ) and WW2 movies.He did not know how to make another kinds of film,and when he nonetheless tried,he should not have.But 13 out of 14 times he made the right choice of the genre. Convoy was a wrathful pointless working class epic that did not belong to Peckinpah's genres.SP's main quality,for me,is that he was sharply criticized by philistines and by respectable inept critics.Moreover,his movies are brutal,indeed,but not in the way the philistines claim that they are. Peckinpah's naturalism is not in his action scenes that have scandalized the imbeciles.McQueen was a handsome and cool middle class, ordinary guy,but not an Adonis;and Peckinpah needed this kind of workman identities for his films.More of SP's movies,than those that he did with, are for McQueen;e.g., Convoy would surely have been better with McQueen as a truckers' messiah,instead of the uninteresting guy he used there. The Ballad of Cable Hogue would not of been better with McQueen,I agree,because an ugly churl,as the one in the movie,was needed for that role.Yet I would of liked "Hogue" with McQueen even better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to spend a day on the set of this film when it was being shot near Huntsville, Texas. My dad was cast as the parole board chairman who denies Doc McCoy (McQueen) his parole in the opening minutes of the film. I got to be on the set during the shooting of that scene, and in the process got to meet McQueen (frankly, I wasn't all that impressed when I met him, but others told me he wasn't feeling well that day), Ben Johnson (a very cool guy, exactly the same off-screen as he is on camera) and Sam Peckinpah (also a very cool and engaging guy - he autographed my dad's copy of the script upside down and backwards so that, as he is standing facing you, you can read his signature). Having that background, and even having been pretty young at the time, it was still a memorable film when I finally got to see it. I've seen it several times since and I think it has stood the test of time as a truly great action film...but, of course I could be somewhat biased.McQueen absolutely dominates the film, as he nearly always did. As for McGraw, I have to say that I think she was fairly wooden and flat in practically every scene she made, but then she was really just there to be eye candy and to give McQueen's character someone to play against...in addition to the fact that she was a co=producer of the movie. The action sequences are superb and set the stylistic direction for many films made since. Peckinpah was a master, there is no doubt. There are so many excellent scenes in this film that it would be hard to catalog them all.If you are a lover of the action film, this is definitely top o' the heap and worth adding to your collection. Even though it was made 35 years ago (and man, does that make me feel old!) it has aged very well and still shines as a classic of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly lyrical crime caper.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Pekinpah is generally considered a director of violent movies and it's easy to see why. Some of the action is in slow motion, which I've come to loathe, but the gimmick is judiciously used here and adds to the Gulp! quotient of the scenes.Steve McQueen has spent five years in prison, doomed to dream of his wife, Ali McGraw, while in submission to a life of rigorous discipline among a horde of hairy, angular strangers. This is all shown to us in one of the best credit sequences I've seen. (Editing by Robert Wolfe and the British Roger Spottiswoode, pronounced "Spots-wood", whom Pekinpah invariably addressed as "Spottis-woodie.")McQueen sends McGraw to visit Ben Johnson to make a deal. Johnson will see to it that McQueen is paroled if he agrees to lead a bank robbery. McQueen will be assisted by two hoods hired by Johnson. The Hood-in-Chief is Al Lettieri, a wolfish brute, evil to the core. McQueen doesn't trust the two hoods, and for good reason. After the robbery, Lettieri kills the other hood, then double crosses Steve McQueen and tries to shoot him. It is usually a big mistake to try to shoot Steve McQueen. McQueen wounds Lettieri, who later crawls into his car and drives to a veterinarian's for treatment. He kidnaps the vet and his shamelessly lustful wife, Sally Struthers, and they take off in pursuit of McQueen and McGraw.Meantime, the couple have gone to Ben Johnson's office to split the half million dollars. McQueen learns that the deal made by McGraw and Johnson involved more than just a robbery. McGraw had to sweeten the pot with her sinewy body. Perhaps out of guilt, she shoot Johnson.McQueen and McGraw take off for a seedy hotel on the outskirts of El Paso, with Lettieri hot on their trail. Johnson's criminal family also knows where the pair are headed and they take off after them too. And by this time, it has been revealed that McQueen was the guy who robbed the bank, so the police are looking for him too. I don't want to run out of space, so let's say our Romantic Couple are involved with one or two shoot outs with the cops and finally reach their destination in El Paso, where everybody runs into everybody else and a monstrous shoot out follows, involving automatic weapons, pistols, a big shotgun, a falling elevator, a pussy cat, and a terrified man hiding under a desk with a pamphlet sticking out of his back pocket -- "Sex Over Fifty." The two lovers cross into Mexico with half a million dollars.The violence hardly comes as a big shocker. What DOES surprise a viewer is how long before we get to a violent scene. I can't imagine this movie being made today without opening with the bank robbery -- followed by a flashback to the prison. The film is positively languorous. There are several scenes between McQueen and McGraw that just linger, without any loss of interest. And there are other scenes that seem picked up out of everyday life, that are like short stories in themselves. McGraw sits at a bar in a railway station, waiting for McQueen to return. The plain-faced soldier sitting next to her clumsily tries to start a conversation. Not to pick her up, necessarily, but just because he's lonely and wants to talk to a good-looking woman. "There aren't more than a handful of non-Mormons in Utah but I'm one of them," he offers. It's as if Candid Camera had captured the episode through a hidden lens. Even the smallest bit parts ring with authenticity -- a Mexican woman on a bench, the clerk in the TV repair place or the gun shop. Furthermore -- get this! -- the cathartic shoot out is NOT THE END OF THE MOVIE. There follow another ten or fifteen minutes of driving around with Slim Pickens in his dilapidated dump truck. No -- they wouldn't make it today.Clichés are assiduously avoided. When McQueen gets out of prison, he and McGraw go to her apartment. He takes off his shirt. She sits on the bed and takes off her shirt. Maybe we expect the usual razzle-dazzle of passion, the ecstatic moans, the lap dissolves from the faces of the panting lovers to the anonymous fingertips caressing the unidentifiable fleshy fossa -- but no. It's been five years for McQueen and (except for that dalliance with Ben Johnson) for McGraw too, and McQueen simply sits there, holding her hand and unable to move. "Don't worry, Doc," she tells him. "I'm nervous too." They kiss. End of scene.McGraw doesn't have that many lines, which is just as well. Her appearance is suitable enough -- the generic beautiful woman -- but she sounds less like the wife of an armed robber in Texas than like a Wellesly graduate who became a model before morphing into an actress. She certainly is outfitted better than McQueen who, throughout, wears an ill-fitting black suit and a prison haircut that seems to have been done by some barber more intent on executing the hair than grooming it.Pekinpah is said to have been a misogynist but this film doesn't make it easy to see. After McQueen learns that McGraw slept with Johnson in order to get him sprung, he slaps her around until she sobs. Conduct unbecoming a gentleman, sure, but not unbecoming a career criminal. On top of that, any sensible viewer will see, as the script itself makes clear, that she did it for HIM. The problem is not hers but the obssessive McQueen's. She's by far the more honest and savvy of the two.Anyhow, see it. And if you disapprove of it, you'd better think again, because some day, sooner or later, Sam Pekinpah will meet you in heaven and break your spine in three different places.</fullReview>

Add to that Mr Cool, or Doc (Steve McQueen) as he was called here, and Ali McGraw as his wife, and you really have a winner of a heist and getaway film.The heist was minimal, with the help of Al Lettieri (Mr. Majestyk, The Godfather) and cowboy star Bo Hopkins (From Dusk to Dawn 2); it was the getaway that was the focus of the film. The action was no stop and you never knew whether they would make it and, if they did, whether their marriage could survive all that happened.Other notables were Sally Struthers of "All in the Family" fame. I never realized just how well endowed she was. She just kept wanting to bust out of those tiny shirts she wore.

There's porn star moustaches, girls getting slapped, waves of tomato blood and McQueen getting nearly killed in the dumpster.

		<shortDescription>The Doctor is In!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is such a raw power to Sam Peckinpah's work that even his ugliest blood baths (The Wild Bunch, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid) are watchable at least once. Then there's his most commercially palatable and mainstream-pleasing The Getaway, a gutty and masculine heist drama with Steve McQueen, Ali McGraw, and Al Lettieri.I love this movie for three reasons. The first is that Peckinpah's stylish tricks and gimmicks don't get in the way of the raw, visceral power of McQueen, but accentuate it. He's found a great balance between visually exciting camera shots and editing and his characters' humanity. When McQueen is confronted by the police and realizes he that he can't run, that he has to use violence to intimidate the cops into backing off, Peckinpah fires up his editing magic by having Doc McCoy unleash a frightening display of controlled rage using a shotgun, a cop car, and a lot of back-and-forth flash cuts and slow motion. The movie slides, bashes through, and lurches forward at the right times, not in spite of itself.Secondly, his central characters, Doc and Carol McCoy (McQueen and Ali McGraw) and their antagonist, Rudy (Lettieri) are fun to watch. McQueen's charisma is undeniable and his brief spurts of savagery toward his adversaries--and McGraw--make him a believable ex-con with an above-average IQ and self-discipline. McGraw is much better than most critics think because her awkward, bitchy Carol really is emotionally stranded in a wasteland where the man bankrolling the heist (Ben Johnson) extorts sex from her and her husband not only doesn't trust her, but blames her for being unfaithful to him.What's a girl to do? McGraw pulls off Carol McCoy not because of a limited acting ability, but because her icy, model looks fit the character with a painful precision. She's a bitch, but she wants her husband back, both physically and emotionally, so badly so that she's willing to be raped for him.In his short career as a bad guy in American films, the late, great Al Lettieri left his mark as a truly hideous gargoyle of a villain. Lettieri could be suave and soft-spoken in The Godfather, smoothly dangerous in McQ, and a sickening and repulsive sociopath here in The Getaway. He's so comfortable as the murderous Rudy that, while you may be struggling with Ali McGraw, you know exactly where you stand and what you get with Rudy. As he coldly guns down Bo Hopkins, turns violent with barbecued ribs, and lets Sally Struthers stroke the barrel of his Colt Python, Lettieri counterpoints McQueen by showing the criminal we expect, a deadly predator who cannot defer gratification. In many ways, it's Lettieri's film.The third and last reason I so enjoyed The Getaway is that its power is so great that even the edited version, shown thirty years ago on CBS and much later on American Movie Classics, is astonishingly violent, but more than that, intense. The work CBS did on The Getaway for its network premiere in 1976 still stands as one of the better editing jobs I think I've ever seen. I always like to see movies uncut and uninterrupted, but if the movie is on TV and I've got nothing better to do, I'll watch it.My only complaint with The Getaway is really with the MPAA. How can anyone have seen this as a PG movie? The language is not that harsh, but the intensity of emotion (see if you can sit still as McQueen pummels McGraw with slaps and backhands) and the sick relationship between Lettieri and his captive/lover Struthers should have earned an R.Oh, well. It's 35 years of water under the bridge. I strongly recommend The Getaway for its artistry and characterizations, not to mention the quality of the chase across Texas, leaving bodies and cars bleeding, smoking ruins.Watch McQueen's eyes as he tries to train Lettieri and Hopkins in the fine art of bank robbery and you'll know your time is being used well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The films of Sam Peckinpah: Director for hire.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway (1972) was a starring vehicle for Steve McQueen and his lady friend Ali McGraw. In need of a paying job, Sam Peckinpah agreed to work on the movie. He tried to make as many changes he could with the script and production personal. As hard as he tried, Steve McQueen had the final say and that included a P.G. rated film and a lot of screen time. Despite all of these flaws, it's still an entertaining movie.Steve McQueen stars as Doc. A man who's been doing a stretch in the joint. When he get's out, he's offered to do a bank job by a shady lawman (Ben Johnson, a Peckinpah regular) who'll provide an early release if he does a simple "job" for him. He even assigns him his own crew (Al Lettieri and Bo Hopkins). What seems like a easy job turns into a s.n.a.f.u. What screwed up this cake walk of a scheme? Who's responsible? Why is everyone after Doc and his old lady (Ali McGraw)? To find out you'll have to watch the action/thriller classic THE GETAWAY.A hired gun project for Sam Peckinpah. At this point in his career, he was taking whatever project that was offered to him. It would be awhile before he received complete control over a film. Take it for what it's worth.Recommended for Sam Peckinpah and Steve McQueen fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grit and realism but tedium and yawns too</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah knew how to make a car chase look real. He knew how to convey the taste and smell of a gunfight through mere sound and vision and he could stamp his own style on typically grim, early 70's, neo-realistic movie making . In short the guy could direct - and how! But in THE GETAWAY, this isn't enough to overcome a drab script and the sullen uninvolving presence of Ali McGraw. The result is a film with many good points, some occasionally poetic images and a dose of down to earth grit, but nothing that the viewer can really grab hold of. The Steve McQueen character, Doc, is just "Frank Bullet" on the wrong side of the law. It's stock McQueen, turn-of-the-70's fare. But whereas "Bullett" had that famous car chase, the complex dark edged plot and McQueen as a good guy doing his best, here, he's a 'bad guy' on the run from even worse bad guys and the whole thing leaves you not caring very much who shoots who in the end. You can take your pick on whether McQueen was just wooden or an absolute master on minimalist acting. He doesn't express very much , there's no wild hysterics, no mugging, no screaming and crying, but what there is, leaves you believeing a great deal more is going on beneath the slightly strained expression that meets the eye. As a smouldering, quiet, anti-hero he had few equals. He's not acting, he's being. McQueen is not the problem with this movie. Ali McGraw, on the other hand, looks as if she arrived on set only to be told she'd signed up to work for free! She's dull, sullen, lethargic and lacking in sex-appeal.It's just going through the motions. She looks as if she rates the whole deal of robbing a bank equal with doing the week's shopping and there's no chemistry whatsoever between her and McQueen.They frankly don't seem to care for each other at all! The sub-plot of her infidelity is simply a bunch of throw away lines. In a better script, and with better casting, it would have turned the entire movie round. Given it the edge it is missing. Visually it all looks great. There is no denying the directors eye for a strong image and the set pieces all work superbly. But frankly it's hard to give a damn at the end. The characters simply do not hold the viewers interest.You just KNOW what will happen and you just don't care.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>McQueen at his coolest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the remake wasn't all bad, there was no way that the original could be improved upon. Although primarily about a heist and an escape with the money, the film is also romantic, but not in a corny "Titanic" way. Sam Peckinpah does a great job with the directing and this is a vast improvement on the pretty depressing Straw Dogs.However Steve McQueen is the main reason to watch this movie;in my opinion it's his best movie and even cooler than "Bullitt", with the minimum of dialogue he really brings the character of "Doc" McCoy to life, and there is real chemistry between him and his co star Ali McGraw (who I think were having an affair in real life).I've heard people compare this movie with "True Romance", but this is by far the superior film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the "depressing" movie that "Baby the Rain Must Fall" wanted to be, but couldn't.McQueen is a believable ex-con, with the haircut to prove it. He's just bad enough to make you root for the cops, except the other bad guy is so much meaner that you are happy when McQueen and McGraw beat the odds and make off to Mexico with the loot.There's not much meaningful dialog in this flick but there's lots of Sam Packinpah brutal, fast as well as slow-mo, action. Ben Johnson is his usual very believable self. Except for his Best Supporting Actor award for The Last Picture Show, he went through his movie career almost unnoticed, probably because he played his aw shucks country boy roles so easily and unaffectedly that he just sort of blended into the scene.It's a decently directed and entertaining, if predictable, film. But all in all a good couple of hours in front of the screen. Plus any movie with Ali McGraw in it gets my vote.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steve and Ali as They Got Hot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If any of you have read Neile McQueen's memoir of life among the flying fists of Steve McQueen, you'll understand why his scene beating up Ali didn't need much practice. Funny, how little sympathy or respect we have today for such a coward, but this movie is making him a sympathetic character. Sure, his wife slept with the Ben Johnson creep in order to spring him from prison. Wouldn't you?There are exciting car chases of the bad guys chasing the bad guys. But Steve and Ali always left anywhere with squealing tires, which doesn't make a lot of sense if you're trying to be unobstrusive. The only good guy is Slim Pickens, and of course, Steve does a Robin Hood and sets this guy up for life. Only fair, since Pickens pulls his chestnuts from the fire.The subplot of the really bad guy who kidnaps the vetaranarian and his wife, Sally Struthers (not begging for money for her starving kids, for a change) is fascinating. She plays a neurotic tramp, who throws her boring husband over for the psychopathic crook. His action with her bra is hilarious, but you feel for the husband as he is bound up and forced to watch the two go at it.The blood flows, and you actually see McQueen recoil from the force of the gun shot, which is realism like you seldom see in a movie. Ali and Steve were just beginning to boil over into what became his 2nd marriage at this time. She was about to leave Robert Evans, which is all nice to know while you're watching the movie.  Steve plays a great robber/convict, and the scenes in the Huntsville, Texas prison which show the tremendous stress that in-jail humiliation does to someone were very well done. It makes his capitulation to the really bad guy on the parole board all that more believable. Oh, yes, and never let anyone put your valuables in a locker for you. What a con!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Getaway is better than it really has any right to be, considering the clash between star and director over the film resulted in the mediocre actor getting his way and the excessively talented director hating the final cut. The opening montage relates the set-up in quick-cuts and sound collisions (compare with Boorman's Point Blank) and in no time we're right down to the action, all double-crossing, triple-crossing, and slow motion shoot-outs. Sure the acting is a bit stilted throughout, with the exceptions of Al Lettieri as the indestructable Rudy and noteworthy walk-ons by a young and buxom &gt;Sally Struthers and an old and toothless Slim Pickens. But McQueen and MacGraw plod through this awkwardly, perhaps distracted by their off-screen romance, leaving this viewer waiting for the next action scene. Luckily not much of a wait, as things flow pretty fast and furious, and the whole affair winds up reasonably satisfying, eclipsing the shortcomings of the wooden leads. The scene on the train is a real nail-biter, and it's that type of scene (as in most of his vastly superior 'Straw Dogs') which shows Peckinpah's biggest asset as a director... after Hitchcock, who else could milk suspense like this? The remake was redundant and ultimately unrewarding. This version still seems well fresher than any of the contrived Hollywood product today.</fullReview>

Slim Pickins, and all the rest of the weirdo characters coming and (mostly) dying are a hoot! I never understood what the appeal of Ali Mcgraw was supposed to be, she's the worst performer in this movie by a mile, and even with Mcqueen, she's a stiff.

		<shortDescription>Far Worse Than You Would Expect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before watching "The Getaway," I thought it would be a decent, entertaining, 70s-style action film - not a classic, but a solid, enjoyable movie. Steve McQueen was known as one of the first "cool" movie stars, and rightly so. Sam Peckinpah was known for directing movies that were violent, stylish, and fast-paced. With "The Getaway" he scored one out of three. What little violence there is isn't even entertaining, since it's not "action," per se, but rather criminals murdering other criminals.For a story about bank robbers on the run from the police and other criminals, "The Getaway" is surprisingly lifeless and anemic. The plot has no drive or momentum. There are a couple of head-scratching segments that seem completely out of place, as if the screenwriter ran out of ideas and had to stop and think for fifteen minutes before writing the next scene. On top of all that, Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw both play unsympathetic characters, and the numerous scenes with Al Lettieri and the woman who becomes his hostage/lover just hurt your eyes."The Getaway" has no redeeming qualities: it's boring, it's unpleasant, it's sleazy, it's too long, and the plot makes little sense. In fact, if this movie had been made with an unknown director and unknown cast, it's unlikely that it would be known today at all. That's how bad "The Getaway" is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It would be hard to criticize almost any of McQueen's films, because when he is on screen it is my own opinion that it is next to impossible to stop watching him, even when he is still. His presence even when silent is so palpable that you sit waiting to see what he will say or do next. Getaway is this breathless, fast chase movie that catches you in bed with McQueen and Ali McGraw as they are falling in love for real, and it does not go unnoticed. There is anger, passion, fear, intense feeling and even affection. One of my favorite parts in this movie was the Sally Struthers character who winds up with the bad guy. This character, with Sally's, continually torments her husband as they fool around in front of him. Not much of this movie is like a Hallmark card, as you can tell, but it's still filled with raw excitement and even genuine love (the omelette scene.) At one point, when the Struthers character is screaming a la Gloria from All in the Family, she gets shut up pretty quickly; a funny scene.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>marriage ala shotgun (and not thoroughly cooked)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jim Thompson, author of the novel "?The Getaway," was one of the weirdest writers of his day (late-'40s,'50s). He wrote basic crime novels - or apparently he did; the first half of every novel reads like the first half of every pulp crime novel being written in that era. I suppose this was to get the publishers to buy the project. But in the 2nd half of his novels - well....Let's take the Getaway. (Now it's been a while since I read it, but this is how I remember it:) First: half: unhappily married gangster couple rob a bank, screw around with other members of the gang, shoot it out, lose them, escape to Mexico. Second half; Escaped gangster couple winds up in a resort hotel for escaping criminals. They are charged exorbitant bucks. They cheat on each other. They try to keep themselves amused (not much to do in that hotel). They watch as other residents of the hotel seem to disappear. They discover that the cost of the hotel has drained their ill-gotten gains completely, yet they are still getting charged a bill. How will they ever pay? -simple: at this hotel, once you go broke - they eat you.I don't know how any film like that could have been made. So I suppose it shouldn't surprise me that the film of the Getaway should stop in mid-novel.Still, I really feel that a good beat got skipped. And it feels like that throughout the whole movie. Even though I find the Peckinpah version fascinating, the remake is probably a better film from the same script, because it isn't burdened with the sense of unfinished business that permeates Peckinpah's film. I think it has to do with the Thompson novel; the remake, which is a new version of the original screenplay, doesn't owe any responsibility to Thompson's novel; but Peckinpah's version does, and can't quite figure out what that responsibility might be.So I will reveal what that responsibility is, even accepting that only half the novel is used: The married couple do not really love each other, they are only in it for the money; consequently, her decision to sleep with the gang boss to get her husband out of prison is not a self-sacrifice, it's a business tactic. This marriage is utterly doomed from the get-go, for the simple reason that both participants are greedy criminal socio-paths - which appears to have been Jim Thompson's basic take on the institution of marriage in its entirety. No wonder no one's made a movie out of Thompson's novel; perhaps they shouldn't have even tried.I think Peckinpah understands this to a certain extent, and probably had a similarly jaundiced view on male-female relationships, as Straw Dogs certainly indicates. But though he was courageous enough to take on the project, he couldn't bring himself to finish it (and McQueen probably wouldn't have let him). Oh, well, the film is as it is, an entertaining crime thriller. (Still, what might have been....)- Ewnnrj</fullReview>

McQueen's role as Doc McCoy was a classic. Getting out of prison, making another robbery, then realizing his accomplice Al Letteri as Rudy Butler is greedy. My favorite scene was the thwarted double-cross between McCoy and Butler. All the shooting, the close-calls, and of course the successful getaway from the law was well planned.

		<fullReview>It's still a Masterpiece, even if it's not the Master's greatest piece.Compare it to the recent remake, and you will see why. Peckinpah didn'tneed "FX". Cars didn't explode in His films. There were no uselessexplosions. The hero had to reload his guns, and he had just as manyshells as he had bought/stolen earlier. There was a stark realism inPeckinpah's films, a realism that wasn't just technical, but personalas well. It was like Real Life. As always, no character was really"good" (except for the extras, maybe), some were "bad" and others were"evil". The hero was caught in a situation he didn't choose. but hecouldn't avoid either. Doc McCoy was intelligent enough to realize thatviolence wasn't the answer, but he was born and grown in violence, sohe couldn't really avoid it. Compared to The Wild Bunch, or Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia, orThe Wild Cross, The Getaway is more like "Peckinpah Light", but it'sstill worth seeing.</fullReview>

I also see Sally Struthers in a different light after seeing her in this movie. Her performance is very good, and adds to the film. Quincy Jones' musical score adds the magic touch.

		<fullReview>A Sam Peckinpah movie based on one Jim Thompson's best books starring Steve McQueen would seem like a surefire winner, a classic. Unfortunately the result was an abomination.The film was hijacked by McQueen who controlled the final cut and watered down a screenplay already watered down from the book. The film was disavowed by both Thompson and Peckinpah and various other involved in its making. The director upon seeing the final cut peed on the screen and shouted, "This is not my film!" Thompson could have (and did) complained, "This is not my story!"One of the great noir classics with a highly original and ironic ending was transformed into an all too typical Hollywood product with an all too typical ending. A book who's tone was dark and dismal was transformed into a cutesy love story/chase film. The end of the movie had nothing to do with the end in the book which is largely the point of the whole story (I'd like to go onhere but can't without violating the no spoiler rule)Steve McQueen who mucked things up off camera even disappoints on camera. He puts on a weak performance as does Ali MacGraw (perhaps they were distracted by there spudding love affair)Other than that Sally Struthers (who I usually don't like) put on an excellent performance the best thing I can say about this flick is that it was not as bad as the remake!Don't waste your time and money on this, read the book. If your really in the mood for a movie see something by Quentin Tarantino or the Coen Brothers or something else by Peckinpah (especially The Wild Bunch) or (if you want to see a movie adaptation of a Thompson book) The Grifters.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never read Jim Thompson's novel on which this film is based, and if Ewnnrj's synopsis is an accurate account of its plot line I can't say that it will be anywhere near the top of my list of books to read before I die. I can, however, understand why Sam Peckinpah, a director notorious for the violent content of his films, should have been attracted to such a story. Whether a film which kept the book's original ending would have passed muster with the censors of the early seventies is another matter. (It was, apparently, changed at Steve McQueen's insistence). The film that actually was made is quite violent enough.Earlier the same year Peckinpah had made another film, "Junior Bonner" (a surprisingly mild one by his standards), also with McQueen. In "The Getaway" he plays Carter "Doc" McCoy, a criminal currently serving time in jail for armed robbery and assault with a deadly weapon. Anxious to be reunited with his beautiful young wife Carol, McCoy reaches a deal with a corrupt local political boss, Jack Beynon. Beynon will use his influence to ensure that McCoy gets parole. In return, McCoy will pull off one last bank robbery and split the proceeds with Beynon.McCoy recruits a gang and organises the crime with great precision; the actual robbery scene is one of Peckinpah's great violent set-pieces, like the similar robbery which opens his earlier film "The Wild Bunch". After making their getaway, however, McCoy and Carol realise that Beynon has set them up. One of the gang, Rudy (who has already murdered another gang member) pulls a gun on them, but McCoy's reflexes are quicker and he is able to empty five shots into Rudy, leaving him apparently dead. McCoy and Carol flee, but Rudy has survived thanks to a bullet-proof vest and pursues them.The film has some other similarities with "The Wild Bunch". Although "The Getaway" has a contemporary setting and "The Wild Bunch" a historical one, both feature a team of bank robbers making a getaway through the sun-baked, dusty deserts of the American South-West and into Mexico. In both cases the fugitives have been set up and are being pursued by desperadoes even more ruthless than themselves. Both films show that Peckinpah's reputation for violence was well-deserved, with plenty of shootout sequences (generally in slow motion), although the body-count in "The Getaway" is not quite as high as in the earlier film. Both films feature a certain amount of grim humour, much of it in "The Getaway" deriving from a sub-plot in which Rudy kidnaps a married couple as hostages and finds that the wife, suffering from a terminal case of Stockholm Syndrome, falls in love with him. There is also that ironical scene near the end where the old dustman is happy to help Doc and Carol when he finds out that they are legally married. Pre-marital sex is, in his book, clearly a worse crime than robbery.Peckinpah is sometimes (with some justification) regarded as a misogynistic director. Many of his films either have a virtually all-male cast ("The Wild Bunch", "Cross of Iron") or portray women as the victims of violence or degradation ("Straw Dogs"). "The Getaway", however, is a rarity in his work in that it has a major female character at the centre of the action.Ali MacGraw was regarded as a big-name star in the seventies, although her body of work was surprisingly small. "The Getaway" was only her fourth film, and it was to be another six years before she appeared in her fifth ("Convoy", also directed by Peckinpah). After her dreadful performance in that sentimental tearjerker "Love Story" she will never be my favourite actress, but I must say that she is much better in "The Getaway". Unusually for a crime thriller, the film is also a love story of a sort, a portrait of the marriage of Doc and Carol. Their mutual love and sexual attraction come through very strongly- unsurprisingly given that McQueen and MacGraw fell in love while making the film and were married soon afterwards- although their relationship is put under strain when it is revealed that Carol slept with Beynon as part of the deal to secure her husband's freedom.McQueen plays Doc in his usual cool, laconic manner. McQueen had played another bank robber a few years earlier in "The Thomas Crown Affair", and although the two films are miles apart in terms of visual style, they have one thing in common in that he is able to make his character a sympathetic one despite his criminal tendencies. The other characters in this film, especially Beynon and Rudy, are all so vicious that the audience are hoping that Doc and Carol will get away with it. (I won't say if they do).Despite the claims that are sometimes made for Peckinpah as a "serious" director, I have never found him a particularly profound one; he generally found it easier to depict violence than to say anything serious about it or to examine its causes. The war film "Cross of Iron" may be an exception, but "The Getaway" is not. It is, however, a well-photographed fast-moving and often enjoyable action-adventure with a surprisingly sympathetic and attractive couple at its centre. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>great McQueen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best McQueen. Period. This and Bullitt were the two he absolutely owned, but here is is really doing his dance. Just look at him in scene after scene doing things that only he could, uhh, excuse the expression, get away with. There have been few, very very few actors with his physical presence: only Burt Lancaster and Jimmy Cagney come immediately to mind, one a supreme dancer the other a circus performer. And of course, McQueen the car and motorcycle rider. That is to say, all of them athletes. Yet even the great dancers, Astaire, Kelly, did not have the fluid movements of McQueen. In this he turns shooting, killing, into pure ballet. Then add those glasses, his little giggle during one of the car escapes, the sharp, knifelike jabs at the neck of the thief on the train and the same kind of jabs at McGraw when he is whacking her around, and none of it overdone, or forced looking.The rest of the movie is pretty standard. The Lettieri stuff, the whole chase, stupid. Much better without poor Harold and Maude, uhh, lamebrain, whatever her name. Sometimes Sam had himself a little too much fun on our behalf. And the Quincy Jones music is actually irritating. But it doesn't matter. Even the scene where McQueen is eating a sandwich with his coke is unique in cinema, with the possible exception of Lancaster muggingingly wolfing down the chow in Vera Cruz with his shiny choppers. Here McQueen, and Jimmy Cagney in White Heat do the kind of stuff that all the money in the world can't buy: you just have to get lucky enough to have brought them along for the ride.And to think that in not much more than six years after the film, McQueen would find all that fine élan gone on an operating table in Mexico. Thanks, Steve. You and Sam did something fabulous here. Not to forget how well they worked in Junior Bonner, a much better film than this, but there McQueen is limping and toned down some and is acting with some pretty great talent: in this one it's just he absolutely owning the screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A curiously celebrated action thriller. I was already feeling disappointed following the overwrought title sequence in the prison (I prefer the way Soderbergh tackles a similar prologue in Ocean's Eleven). However, the bulk of the film proper is much better than this would have lead us to believe, full of well-calibrated and tensely dovetailed action set-pieces.McQueen is really very good, playing a different character but with the same depth as that of the earlier Bullitt. He has a strong cast around him - competent support in Ali McGraw and a brilliant pursuing doppelganger in Al Lettieri. All this makes it even more irritating to find the film lumpy - cameos, improvised moments and a horribly scuffed ending (the intention to have an upbeat ending is something I applaud, but not like it is).It's a film of some integrity - one might say it puts the gritty in integrity in fact - but it's also beholden to its main-feature status: a blockbuster before its time, it suffers from a tacit pressure to produce 'moments', key scenes to grip the audience's attention. If you can bear this overt character to the film you'll enjoy it more than I did. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crowd puzzlement when I saw this film in Jakarta, Indonesia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In August of 1973 I was finishing up a two year stint in Indonesia as a Missionary for the Mormon Church. One day a month we could take an afternoon off and possibly see a movie. On this day we went to see "The Getaway". My district of four missionaries were the only non-Indonesians in the theater. The movie was not dubbed, but instead had sub-titles of varying degrees of accuracy. Some of the translations were real howlers. In one scene set in a bus station some solider goes up to Ali Mcgraw and asks her "are you a Mormon girl?" She says she isn't, and then the soldier says ,"I'm from Orem, Utah, which is right near there to Salt Lake City". Not only was the dialogue a fairly classic example of the Utah dialect of English, but Orem, Utah was my home town. At this bit of dialogue my entire district started cheering. Obviously, the dialoge in and of itself was not worthy of such an enthusiastic response, and a lot of the Indonesians in the audience looked at us and then inquired in whispers what the dialoge in English had been in comparison to the fairly accurate translation, as they were curious why it drew such a reaction from us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clumsy action film that picks up steam despite itself</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film pales in comparison with director Sam Peckinpah's other work from this period. While "The Wild Bunch," "Straw Dogs" and, to a degree, "Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid" are completely captivating works, blending top-notch acting, direction, and storytelling,"The Getaway" is a feeble sibling with only bits of Peckinpah's usual brilliance.The plot, which centers around the (mis)adventures a husband and wife heist team on the lam, is likely deftly served by cult crime writer Jim Thompson, it only chugs along clumsily for the first hour on celluloid. There are occasional interesting touches and a good supporting cast, but little in the way of real inspiration. Surprisingly, there are extended sequences when the film distinctly mirrors the faceless cop dramas that were playing on television at the time the film was released.Much of the blame can be put on the self-styled "Bogey and Bacall" of the 70s, stars MacGraw and McQueen. While the two attractive leads lend the film an air of a modern day "Bonnie and Clyde," and were box-office draws, they nearly sink the film entirely. It has been written that McQueen decided to edit this film on his own (!), but as he was one of the better actors of the decade, his ill-advised hubris is unmatched by the near worthlessness of MacGraw's performance.MacGraw can't even seem to draw upon her life romance with her co-star to kindle any on screen chemistry, and McQueen seems stiff and uncomfortable in his romantic scenes with his wife. Yet as one somewhat anonymous chase leads to another, the subplot involving a thug, Sally Struthers's dimwitted blonde and her pathetic veterinarian husband takes continually stranger turns, things heat up amidst a hail of bullets, garbage, and sheer momentum. (Peckinpah could obviously handle these types of chores with his eyes closed.) Despite its many faults, "The Getaway" manages to come to a fairly satisfying conclusion.Worth a look on cable, and certainly interesting to fans of the stars (if there any MacGraw fans out there) and the director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not perfect, but as far as the multitude of Jim Thompson screen adaptations go, this one is slightly above average. The casting of then popular Ali McGraw in the lead female role hasn't aged real well, and Steve McQueen is a little too young to be a convincingly world-weary Doc. Still and all, there's a great supporting cast (Slim Pickens, Bo Hopkins, Dub Taylor)and enough Peckinpah flourishes to make this a worthwhile venture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It just made me want to watch 'wild at heart' the whole time. I realize it's a different time/era, but what started off as a badass movie became dulled by Ali MacGraw's crappy overdubs, melodramatic minor characters, crayola fake blood, and extraneous shots, which kind of kill the continuity. Worst of all though is I now have 'That's What Friends are For' stuck in my head because a bulk of the soundtrack score has the same freakin melody. Quincy Jones really ran a hot streak of poo in the years between 'The Getaway' soundtrack and 'We are the World.'There were highly enjoyable parts, though. The whole Rudy/Fran/Harold thing is strangely amusing, and Slim Pickens cameo is great. It seems that booting the book's author off the screenplay job as well as firing the original scorer may have landed Steve McQueen a pretty mediocre movie, but he was probably just content with landing Ali MacGraw.i give it three stars--it would have gotten four, but 'That's What Friends are For' is a crappy song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film hits all its marks -- by aiming low</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As this film ably demonstrates, literally and symbolically, if you aim a shotgun at a big enough target, you're gonna hit something. This film takes a lot of the more controversial and distasteful aspects of "The Wild Bunch" and "Straw Dogs" and presents them devoid of all philosophical content. It's a triumph of style over substance. I get it -- in 1972, McQueen and Peckinpah were both in need of a box-office hit. So they got Ali McGraw, who can't act to save her life but manages to get halfway there in this film, and off they go on a crime spree. Author David Weddle noted in his book on Peckinpah that the director made off with about $500,000 at the end of the day -- the same amount McQueen and McGraw's characters made from the heist. Fitting.It's not a "bad" movie.... the performances are underwhelming, pretty much all around (Ben Johnson disappears too quickly to make much more than an impression), but the action scenes are compelling and the suspense is strong. The story does not make a lot of sense.... for example, Johnson's character is sitting there in the house with all that loot just waiting for McQueen, under the assumption that McQueen's wife is going to betray him. This powerful, cynical man had no back- up plan whatsoever? Time and again, Peckinpah puts pedal to the metal and blasts right through story and character logic, but we don't mind too much.It's sort of a high-class drive-in movie.... not quite as much mayhem as "Gone in 60 Seconds", but close. McQueen and McGraw are a super sexy couple, and there's an amusing (although sadistic) side story with Sally Struthers and the suitably disgusting Al Lettieri. It's the sort of film Jack Hill would make if he had a bit more money; the stuff that Tarantino fans' dreams are made of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>thin story with Peckinpah action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doc McCoy (Steve McQueen) is released on parole. His wife Carol (Ali MacGraw) is dutifully waiting for him. Sheriff Beynon (Ben Johnson) got him out in exchange for Doc to do a bank job worth at least $500k. Beynon assigns him Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) and Frank Jackson as his crew. The bank job goes wrong. Frank kills a guard. Rudy shoots Frank. Rudy tries to shoot Doc but Doc beats him to the draw. Rudy wearing a bullet-proof vest survives. Benyon also tries to doublecross Doc with Carol's help but Carol shoots Benyon instead. Carol slept with Benyon trying to get Doc out of prison. Meanwhile Rudy kidnaps a couple (Jack Dodson, Sally Struthers).Director Sam Peckinpah gets to do a lot of action with a simple thin plot. The characters aren't that deep. The couple has a good turn in the story. The tension is surprisingly not that high. It's an action road film that needs more excitement. While the action is good, the movie is very slow a lot of the times. It really only has Peckinpah's action going for it and he's using too much slow motion action. While Rudy's story is a bit different, I'm not really invested in him or his captives. Also I would have made Doc a harder man. Carol is right. He's not hard enough. However the movie has got good Peckinpah action but not much else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the outset the plot seems ordinary enough. McQueen is in jail, and he wants out. In order to get what he wants he will have to repay his powerful benefactor by committing yet another crime. Slightly ironic, but not really that interesting. However, as the movie moves forward we are presented with twists and turns in the plot, along with some really original storytelling, both of which make the journey much more interesting than originally thought.Where there is any, the dialogue is weak. It does not help matters that McGraw's delivery is stiff, she oftentimes seems to be reading from a cue card. The fact that not much thought was put into the script is obvious, fortunately none of the characters is particularly verbose, and many of the best scenes are punctuated by strong body language and the sheer magnetic presence exuded by McQueen.While McQueen's presence on screen is dynamic, as usual, his acting is, as usual, weak. The man was always something of an enigma due to his amazing ability to capture and hold your attention, while simultaneously forcing you to wonder how he continued to get work as an actor. I suppose that is what made him the quintessential movie star of the 60s: a big, bold personality that was fun to watch, without forcing the audience to think too much.Conversely, the supporting cast, Al Lettieri in particular, is strong. Lettieri had one of the most intimidating faces the screen has ever seen, which probably explains why he was usually the heavy in movies like 'The Godfather' and 'Mr. Majestyk'. He was a gifted performer whose character's storyline in this movie is both interesting and wholly original. The movie worth watching for him if for nothing else.The first half-hour of the movie was put together somewhat haphazardly, which is particularly disappointing since, as with almost all movies, most of the plot's key elements are put into place at the beginning. The result is that everything that goes on after the bank robbery that McQueen must pull off is somewhat mystifying and the viewer finds himself wondering who is supposed to meet up with who, and where the meets are supposed to go down. Eventually everything is clarified, but not before some initial confusion detracts from the overall impression of the movie.All in all, the movie is brimming with originality, taking the age old 'bank heist' story and adding one intriguing, yet plausible, twist after another. The film also features a solid ending with a pleasant cameo from the always reliable Slim Pickens. However, not insubstantial problems with the dialogue, acting, and editing prevent me from recommending it too highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Journeyman work to be sure from Sam Peckinpah. When Steve McQueen is sprung from prison by crooked politician Ben Johnson, the payback is to pull off a simple bank robbery. Along with his resourceful wife (Ali McGraw) and some dubious cohorts, including nasty Al Lettieri, McQueen knocks the bank over with ease, only to get involved in an extended chase with everyone turning on each other. Left for dead by McQueen, Lettieri kidnaps a veterinarian and his daffy wife (Sally Struthers) and plots his revenge. It's all very fast paced, at times fairly comical (particularly the Lettieri/Struthers "romance") with all the actors in top form (even McGraw is tolerable with her flaring nostrils and perpetual scowl). McQueen and McGraw have great chemistry. With the great Richard Bright as an unlucky grifter and the oddly cast Jack Dodson as the vet who helps Lettieri only to be tortured. Slim Pickens appears briefly.</fullReview>

McGraw is an awful actress, and McQueen's acting here...well, he didn't have much of a script to work with. I have so many problems with this film....OK; after stealing $750,000, they just cross into Mexico in the front seat of the truck?? Faces plastered all over TV? Like the borders wouldn't have reward info on them?? The remake has a great cast, for this type of film, James Woods shows what this character should be like? His dialog delivery makes you feel hate, the other version makes you feel nothing. Jennifer Tilly was even better in her role! Alec Baldwin is perfect for this, Kim Bassinger is 10 times the actress of McGraw...I'm sorry, the '72 version is junk. Just because Steve McQueen was cool, and is dead, doesn't make everything he did "the Best" Peckinpah made a few good film, but the more i watch them the more I realize that Straw Dogs and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia are his only solid work. Wild Bunch? How many times do I have to be forced to watch a bunch of guys laugh together to imply a sense of camaraderie? Great shoot out scenes but come on?!

He is detailed and obsessive about his work, yet cannot help the fact that so many of his plots are mired in stupidity and illogical thinking...much like Ed Wood.Both men are passionate about their work, neither have any overall talent. That Wild Bunch became successful was a fluke since it has powerful artistry and little else on Peckinpah's part. The Getaway cemented my view of "Bloody Sam" as a one-hit wonder. The plot is simple, even for Peckinpah, and the casting is as bad as it can be.Steve McQueen never has been a strong actor. He, like Sean Connery, John Travolta, and Charles Bronson, is a presence actor who never develops any character. Here McQueen is no more than an extension of his Bullitt character. What's so great about that?Overall, a pretty bad film with no effort on your part to enjoy. 1 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

Sam Peckinpah is a very good action director, and those sequences do work, as do the scenes that open the film: McQueen is prison, thinking about the things dearest to him (including MacGraw). The story, though, plods along, until the climatic shootouts.

		<fullReview>Sam Peckinpah, the director of bloody, gritty action filmsin the '70s, is at the helm in this fast-paced, if overally dull crime thriller. A criminal named Doc (Steve McQueen) is released from a Mexican slammer thanks to the efforts ofhis wife Carol (Ali McGraw), whom requested the help froma shadowy sheriff named Benyon (Ben Johnson). After another bank heist, Doc and his accomplices Frank (Bo Hopkins) and Rudy (Al Litteri) decide to split the money, but something goes horribly wrong with the exchange, and Doc and Carol are soon on the run from the police and machine gun-toting thugs.In 1994, "The Getaway" was put into a remake, which wasdirected by Roger Donaldson ("Species"), and starred Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger as the outlaw couple Doc and Carol. So Baldwin isn't as cool and conniving as how McQueen was inthe remake, but Basinger really outshines McGraw in both looks and acting performance!! Plus, although the violence in theoriginal "Getaway" is quite grim and gory, the remake has more exciting shootouts and escapes as the original. So, basically, this is one of the few cases where the original fails totop the remake!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film first time, and for some reason dozed off, so I decided to try again, and I'm glad I did, from director Sam Peckinpah (Straw Dogs). Basically bank robber 'Doc' McCoy (Steve McQueen) applies for parole from the Texas prison he is being held in, and he is granted it, much to the surprise of his wife Carol (Ali MacGraw). Not long after getting out though, Doc needs to do a small favour for mob boss Jack Beynon (Ben Johnson), robbing another bank. So he and co-robber Rudy Butler (Al Lettieri) do the job, but it is obvious they will not get away with when it backfires. So begins a long chase with Doc and Carol pursued by some police, crazed Rudy, and the heavily armed henchmen of Beynon. After all the guns firing, hiding and going from vehicle to vehicle, Doc and Carol do get away in the end with the large amount of cash in the suitcase, I guess that is a happy ending. Also starring Sally Struthers as Fran Clinton, Slim Pickens as Cowboy, Richard Bright as The Thief, Jack Dodson as Harold Clinton, Dub Taylor as Laughlin, Bo Hopkins as Frank Jackson, Roy Jenson as Cully and John Bryson as The Accountant. McQueen is charismatic, I suppose MacGraw has her moments, they do both make a good duo, and they did fall in love and marry in real life. With some pretty good action, chase sequences and a little violence, this is quite a worthwhile crime thriller. It was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score for Quincy Jones. Very good!</fullReview>
