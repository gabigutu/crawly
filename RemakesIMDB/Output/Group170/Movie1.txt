		<shortDescription>Steamy, Entertaining Re-Make</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very entertaining, if morally way below par, action movie which consistently keeps your attention with intense scenes. Kim Bassinger probably looked as good as she ever looked which is saying a lot. She has one of the steamiest scenes I've ever seen on a mainline film (my tape was the "unrated" version) but at least it was with her real-life husband (at the time) Alec Baldwin.This re-make of the 1972 film also has Michael Madsen, James Woods, Mike Morse and Jennifer Tilley - all playing sleazy characters. They are so bad they make Baldwin &amp; Bassinger look like monks. This movie is not exactly Mary Poppins. There's almost too much of a mean edge to it....almost. Perhaps I enjoy ogling Bassinger too much to can this movie for its baseness.Whatever, this entertains to the degree that it makes it a very quick two hours. There is no way you could get bored watching this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The action scenes are top notch. Maybe I'm just a sucker for colorful characters and the bank heist angle is well done. Best of all is Alec Baldwin's character, Doc. Baldwin and the rest of the cast really deliver their lines with panache.Bank jobs, car chase, cat-and-mouse in a four story hotel, steamy sex, crazy characters.... what else do you want?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a interesting remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I tend to like the original more yet the 1994 remake THE GETAWAY, was a very good film. The strength of this version is the modren pacing and action also the revamped dialouge and several additional characters. I bumped into david morse once...of note is his role in this film. THE GETAWAY works because the chemistry of sex and violence between the characters played by BALDWIN and BASINGER works. It's not cheesy or contrived. This film is a tale of moral love betrayal and the classic analogy of there being no honor among thieves. The remake follows pretty much the same plot as the STEVE MCQUEEN classic yet takes a few different turns. Fans of the original will like this version as well, one nice aspect is that it maintains a similar look to the original. During the early 1970's several films like this and GONE IN 60 SECONDS had the same visual flair. This film matches the tone of the original and succeeds as a modren film for contemporary audiences.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worthwhile remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently had the opportunity to watch this movie and the 1972 version back to back (the modern version first). I was amazed at how exactly some of the minute details in the original movie were repeated in the remake. The garbage bin, the locker gimmick, the character of the innkeeper and paint truck owner. It was interesting at how many of the touches were not unnecessarily "modernized". (I like that).I was able to enjoy both versions. Some people made comments disdaining the remake, but I thought it was a worthy movie, if just because it was a more sexy polished version. --I admit I'm biased, because I thought Kim Basinger was one of the hottest women I've seen in movies (I can't believe she was over 40 when she made the film). Her action/shooting scenes near the end were also very well done. The chemistry between her and Alex Baldwin was also superb, I guess due in some part to the fact that they were (or were going to be) a husband-wife couple in real life too. I also liked the movie to enjoy the differences between the actors (and interpretation) within the almost exact same construct. Steve McQueen's more hardboiled tightly wound character to Alec Baldwin's character who seemed to have a more innate gentleness (sort of like being a victim of circumstance). But of course both being pleasingly hard resourceful men. The old paint truck drivers at the end were also great character actors. Nice ending.Another interesting aspect of the film was how fit Alex Baldwin and David Morse looked. 11 years has passed since the film was made, but they both (esp. Morse) look a lot younger. The beauty of youth! James Wood and Mike Madsen in distinctive "enemy" roles also did what they both do best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great remake of a wonderful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I usually hate it, when they go back and look for movies to redo just to earn some cheap cash. In this case I feel differently though.It begins with the cast. A lot of (then) hot actors like Alec Baldwin, Kim Basinger, Michael Madsen, James Woods... Need I go on?Also they kept most of the basic plot and elevated it to a new level. The new version is bolder and should appeal to a new audience.It's a classic tale of deception, love, and betrayal.First our Hero, Doc (Baldwin) get's thrown in Jail. After a year his wife (his back then actual wife Kim Basinger) makes a deal with the crook turned respected businessman Jack Benyon. He's to rob a racetrack. For this Benyon already assembled a team. That includes the guy that was kind of responsible for Doc getting sent to jail for a year. The heist goes off almost without a hitch but from that moment on everything goes south. first Rudy (Madsen) kills the 4th guy involved in the thing and then tries to off Doc and his wife. Doc's of course faster with the gun and hurts Rudy badly. He survives though, because he wore a bulletproof vest, which he usually doesn't. Then doc and his wife head up to Benyons place to split up the money. Benyon (Woods) of course has other plans. Plans that involve Docs Wife (a really hot looking Basinger). But she opts to go with her husband and kills Benyon. So no they not only have Benyons Guys on their tail but also the very pi**ed off Rudy. If I were to continue telling you the plot there would be no need for you to watch the movie. Just let me tell you that it's a great remake that tops the original in several aspects. The acting is top notch by almost all the major characters. The action is fast paced and very violent. (I base this on the unrated HD-DVD).So if you have a few bucks lying around. Get this movie, I am pretty sure you can get it for under $10 in about every big store..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rare Chemistry Makes This Remake Work... Look At Michael Madson's Hair!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a married couple when they portrayed the married McCoys in this 1994 remake of the 1972. Their on-screen chemistry is incredible. Any time you get this kind of casting occurrence in a film, it is at least worth checking out. Here it really works. The thing that distinguishes this Jim Thompson story is the catch-22 Carol McCoy is faced with- and the percussive effect her necessary action has on the McCoy couple- while the tension is ratcheted up to 11- in their non-stop hour-and-a-half getaway throughout the Southwest.It is a juicy role for a married couple, and Baldwin &amp; Basinger make the most of it. They both are in prime form here and very compelling to watch together. Besides the McCoys (and Richard Farnsworth), it is a B film. Michael Madson's hair is a real challenge to deal with. At least you can cut out of the Richard Marx end credit song. You have to live with Michael Madson's hair for the whole ride. IMDb rating should be around 7.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the 90's best films in the genre!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this movie it's obvious that not all the remakes are a mess. The Getaway's 1994 version is much better than the Steve McQueen-original witch is not a bad movie at all. But the Getaway 94 is a blood-pumping intelligent hot action film with deep human characters, amazing sex scenes (rare in American movies), real action and a very good plot. Roger Donaldson's directing is the highest grade of action film making. The script is perfect the stars are phenomenal (Alec and Kim in their best form), even the supporting actors are very good: James Woods, Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly and Richard Farnsworth. Alec and Kim are the Bonnie &amp; Clyde of the nineties portraying very human criminals, their conflicts are so real in the story... after all it's one of the best films in the genre of the 90s! A must see for every action-thriller fan!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the end The Getaway is an OK action movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway is a remake of the action classic that stared Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw. Now I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two but by it self this is an OK action thriller. It goes old school with its desert/western setting, bad criminals and finale stand off. When I watched this movie I had no idea what kind of movie it is. The story is simple Doc McCoy (Alec Baldwin), his wife (Kim Basinger) and his partner (Michael Madsen) are hired to get a man out of prison. When the job goes sour, McCoy is locked up for a year in a Mexican prison. With the help of his wife and a Phoenix crime boss Jack Benyon (James Woods), he released and hired to do one more job. This job goes semi good but after it has been done many people end up dead and the McCoys are on the run from many different people all with their eyes on the large amount of cash they have. The performances are OK. Basinger is tough yet still has that soft side and she very good with guns. Madsen is a good mix with Baldwin and Basinger, he add the funny but villainous third part of the gang. The cast is bigger than normal for an action film but since this was made in the early ?90's some of the actors hadn't hit it big yet. Jennifer Tilly, Phillip Seymore Hoffman and David Morse round out the cast. They all have small parts but they do the best with what they have. The action is not really original and there are a few Woo slow-motion shots thrown in for good measure. There's only one explosion but a lot of guns. The protagonists aren't very likeable, though. In fact, no one in this film is, with the possible exception of Richard Farnsworth's character at the end. Jennifer Tilly threw herself into her role, and both Michael Madsen and James Woods, do their usual creepily evil personas with aplomb. THE GETAWAY works because the chemistry of sex and violence between the characters played by BALDWIN and BASINGER works. It's not cheesy or contrived. This film is a tale of moral love betrayal and the classic analogy of there being no honor among thieves. The remake follows pretty much the same plot as the STEVE MCQUEEN classic yet takes a few different turns. Fans of the original will like this version as well, one nice aspect is that it maintains a similar look to the original. This film matches the tone of the original and succeeds as a modren film for contemporary audiences.A major problem with The Getaway is the way the McCoys are seemingly able to sense danger when there is not even the slightest indication of it. Carter, for example, has the incredible ability enabling him to know a gunman is just outside his door as soon as he finishes another bedroom scene with his wife! This serves as an example of how unimaginative things get. the infamous sex scenes are really undeserving of the attention. They are gratuitous in the extreme as they don't serve the story whatsoever. You can't believe the characters like each other that much, having spent most of their time in bitter argument. Believe me, you won't like these characters either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining Gangsters.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a pretty decent movie as these things go. Baldwin is Doc McCoy, newly released from prison in order to commit a high-end robbery. Faced with cheating partners, he and his wife, Basinger, make off with a gym bag full of large notes and are pursued throughout the Southwest to the Mexican border, where they finally take off on their own. There is some conflict internal to the family because Basinger had to allow the head of the parole board, also the manager of the robbery, access to her succulent body, and Baldwin resents this, sometimes violently, for the first two thirds of the movie.Lots of action, more explicit sex and brutality, and competent performances, yet something is missing. The chief subtrahend is originality. It's a remake of Sam Pekinpah's film of the same name, with Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw, from the 1960s. Pekinpah's production was edgier, with unexpected incidents, and used some magnificent locations in west Texas. And the production design and set dressing were superior. Even so quotidian a setting as a garbage dump outside of El Paso reeks with atmosphere in Pekinpah's film. Here, it's just a garbage dump. The same can be said of the interior -- and the exterior, for that matter -- of the seedy hotel in which the final shoot out takes place.But it isn't so much these details that detract from one's enjoyment of the film, it's the realization that it was done -- and done better -- almost thirty years earlier by a director in whose veins the balance between booze and talent was proportionate. How much in the way of credit should accrue to writers, directors, and producers who simply imitate a successful earlier movie in an attempt to cash in on its popularity and on the loosening of moral strictures in Hollywood? The remake is not quite shot-for-shot but almost, and much of the dialog is identical.Generally speaking, the performances here aren't bad, even though Baldwin is groomed on his release from the slams like a Hollywood star and lacks McQueen's jailhouse haircut. Kim Basinger does a bit better in the role of prisoner's wife than Ali McGraw did, for that matter. McGraw, unfortunately for her, cute as she was in her darkly furry way, always sounded as if she'd just graduated from Wellesley, which at one time she had.And the direction is competent without adding much to the goings on. Slow motion is used where Pekinpah had used it. And, if you want an instructive scene, watch the trio of bad guy Michael Madsen, Jennifer Tilly, and the DVM James Stevens when Madsen and Tilly become playful and start throwing take-out food at one another -- fried chicken and french fries. Madsen, without provocation, becomes angry and orders Tilly back into the front seat. In Pekinpah's movie the take out is barbecued ribs with sticky tomato sauce and they're tossed back and forth with abandon. The bad guy remains in the back seat and, pelted about the face with a couple of hefty ribs, grows visibly more irritated until he ends the game in an outburst of pique. Both the players and the car's interior are coated with Texas barbecue sauce. There's hardly any comparison in the effectiveness of the two, almost identical, incidents. Pekinpah's is superior.None of this should stand as a condemnation of the remake itself. If it stands alone, it's suspenseful and diverting. The world is largely divided into good guys and bad. That usually makes for easily digested entertainment and this movie delivers the goods.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Let me start by saying that I have not seen the original, 1972 version of "The Getaway". As a result, this critique for the 1994 version will concentrate solely on the impressions it left me after having viewed it, without any references and comparisons with the original one."The Getaway" is a typical action film, in which the two main heroes, Doc McCoy (Baldwin), and his sexy wife, Carol (Basinger), are being double-crossed by their gang mates; although it involves several smaller sub-plots, the movie is mainly showing us the couple being on the run, as they are trying to flee from successive unpleasant situations.The idea of the storyline does not sound very novel, and indeed it is not. And yet, although the movie has a "have-seen-it-several-times-before" taste, it does work and it is quite enjoyable.Donaldson's direction keeps the story rolling fast, and yet successfully avoiding to overdo the action scenes. As far as the acting is concerned, the duo does a fair job, with Bassinger proving us that she has also some substance apart from her splendid looks; I liked also Madsen in his role as the archetypal bad guy, while Woods has a small but well-acted appearance as the rich mobster.To sum this up, "The Getaway" may not be a masterpiece, yet it offers two entertaining hours. 6/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Roger Donaldson's remake of Sam Peckinpah's 1972 gangster movie classic "The Getaway" is alright, but cannot - as many remakes - reach the power, humor and style of the original version. There are some plus points - the bloody and lengthened showdown in the hotel at the end tries to overpower the impact of the original version, and it works.There are some good supporting roles from James Woods and Michael Madsen (with dreadful hair style that belongs rather into an Ace Ventura or Wayne's World movie). The plot, even many story details, are just repetitions of the Peckinpah movie, but the tempo of the film is okay as well.Otherwise there are also too many low points: the score is boring and can't compete with Quincy Jones' original jazz funk fusion grooves. The photography is to clean despite all the Mexican dust and sometimes too MTV style and without the dirty atmosphere that was typical for many Peckinpah movies.Kim Basinger is alright in the Ali McGraw role, but Alec Baldwin is trying too hard to copy an image of Steve McQueen which isn't working at all. The dialogues aren't as witty as with McQueen and McGraw, and Donaldson would have done a far better job if he could have managed to give an individual life to this picture instead of just doing a 1994 techno grunge remix of an early seventies classic.Anyway, if you like to watch an entertaining contemporary gangster and road movie, the 1993 version of "The Getaway" is still fun to watch. But if you have the choice to take the original VHS or DVD, skip the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dethroning the King of Cool?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you remake one of Steve McQueen's best-known movies, comparisons are inevitable. Alec Baldwin is believable as the hardened criminal 'Doc' McCoy but where McQueen was able to suggest that there may be mitigating factors in the way his life turned out, Baldwin appears much harder, although he does show that there is at least honour among thieves. When all is said and done, this is a fairly straight remake, and the differences are all in the playing.Doc McCoy, facing a long prison sentence, sends his wife Carol, played by Kim Basinger, to ask for help from a corrupt businessman, Jack Benyon, played by James Woods. In return, Doc agrees to pull a robbery for Benyon. However the payment Benyon asks of Carol McCoy is beyond what Doc had in mind. She pays the price and Doc is released. Doc does the robbery but from this point on a series of double crosses sees Doc and Carol on the run ? pursued by other criminals, the law and tensions between themselves. It all comes to a head with a shootout in a hotel in Texas. It is hard to believe that the McQueen version of "The Getaway" is over 40 years old, and that the King of Cool is now long gone. Of course, anyone familiar with the earlier version will know exactly what happens next although the sex scenes featuring Baldwin and Basinger register a few points higher on the Richter scale.In the end, the success or otherwise of this version comes down to nuance and shades of meaning ? the way Shakespeare's plays are open to a new interpretation, giving them relevance for each generation. Not that the script for "The Getaway" has much to do with Shakespeare, nor likely to be required reading for high school students in the future, but it does provide a suitable vehicle for Baldwin and Basinger. Alec Baldwin will not replace the memory of Steve McQueen in this role, but Kim Basinger fares better when compared to Ali McGraw. Basinger projects a sultry presence; she is not a particularly animated actress, and the role of Carol McCoy seems tailor-made for her. It is only when she exchanges light dialogue with Richard Farnsworth's character near the end of the movie that you realise how heavy going the rest of the film is, exposing a fundamental problem ? The McCoys are not fun people and it is hard for the audience to really like them.The subplot involving McCoy's ex-partner, Rudy, and his encounter with the veterinarian and his wife is just as nasty in this version with Michael Madsen creating a truly repellent character. Where this movie shines is in its production values and solid pacing; the action is exciting and the locations are interesting. Maybe thirty years from now, another group of filmmakers will feel the time is right for another interpretation of "The Getaway", but if they do, I think the King of Cool will still rule.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Too many action-thriller conventions when it should stay grounded and gritty, but The Getaway is a fast and frenetic film that sustains meek study and interest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1994 version of Jim Thompson's novel and Sam Peckinpah's 1972 film is sporadic but good fun; not really knowing what it wants to be by the end but taking us on a bizarre journey of typically unexciting action that branches out into hard boiled, gruff talking neo-noir inspired leads in somebody's debt before becoming a chase film. It then culminates in one, long shootout and makes the ill-judged move to incorporate comedy into its text. Director Roger Donaldson shoots these gunfights near the very end with a certain guilty pleasure-infused ideation; piling on the slow motion and having one of his female leads squealing uncontrollably in a, perhaps deliberately, annoying manner. There is also a set piece involving one gangster stalking his target, who's hiding in a motel room across the courtyard, and what should be a dramatic, tension filled chain of 'looks' and 'reactions' and silhouettes just becomes a somewhat humorous series of shots that just happens to end in someone getting shot.Donaldson doesn't bring anything particularly constructive to this text bar the, perhaps obligatory, upping of both violence and profanity. But along with this, he tries to make the lead female come across as a more desirable individual than Peckinpah did as well as feeling the need to include more explosions and more set pieces ? this version of The Getaway felt more 'stagey', it felt broader but much to its dis-credit; it got confused and began to blur the lines between what makes a film a good neo-noir and what makes a film fall very much into the realm of a bad action flick.One underlying theme or consistent feeling this remake has is its periodic look at greed, or what people would actually go through for a small, or potentially small, amount of money. At spaced stages throughout this film, a con-artist at a train station will attempt to trick an attractive young woman out of her case prior to knowing what was inside of it; an owner of a motel will turn in an old friend on demand from some strangers for a little bit of money and the catalyst for the entire film to even occur sees a relatively wealthy and established man in Jack Benyon (Woods) charge four men with breaking into an establishment for the sake of some more money.The film works to a very basic level, primarily thanks to this spaced study but it also finds time to flesh out a character in Fran Carvey (Tilly), as this young and somewhat naive woman that initially just wants to aid in sick animals with her elderly veterinarian husband. This is before Michael Madsen's Rudy Travis shows up, an injured and pretty ticked off gangster-come-thief, that hijacks both the couple and the couple's car as they head out in search of the money. The kidnapping takes place amidst a room of harmless kittens, which acts as interesting of sorts juxtaposition.The money comes about after three individuals hold-up an area at a race track in which they keep their money. One betrays the other and then someone else betrays them resulting in a chase across America to the Texas-Mexico border. Initially, The Getaway carries a wavered and uneven feel. Rather than begin like the original with its male lead already in prison, it initially sees its lead characters of Carter 'Doc' McCoy (Baldwin) and Carol McCoy (Basinger) partake in an apprehension of a Mexican criminal, which is badly constructed and executed with too much ease on the characters' behalf. Following this, is the imprisonment of Doc when Rudy seemingly does the only thing possible at the time and leaves him behind for the authorities. It plants a somewhat meek seed in our minds that Rudy is of this nature.When in prison, Doc learns the 'importance of life' and that 'life is very delicate and something to be treasured' through cradling a mouse for part of his duration, in what is another scene in which the film calls on small, defenceless animals to act as a visual representation of either emotions and/or the realisation of a situation. He is called upon to do the race course job with another guy and his old chum, Rudy. Through the mouse, he decides this will be his last. The fact the leads are in debt to the mentioned Jack Benyon keeps a fair degree of suspense for a while as this figure more powerful than the leads calls the shots. But do we really care for or fear Benyon when certain betrayals occur? Not really. His acting as a threatening off screen presence doesn't really work.One instance in the original that I really liked and thought captured the crux of the situation was a certain scene at a landfill. The two leads were dirty, grimy and somewhat demoralised but realised crime is exactly this and this is their chosen way of life ? their enemies will be soldiering on in order to capture them and they must stay focused and rise to the challenge. The Getaway brushes over these sorts of scenes and studies, opting for more emphasis on the slow motion deaths and the police cars and the explosions, typified in the instance someone shoots a petrol tanker in the race course car park forcing an explosion when driving off was all that needed to have been done. But the film does enough right, overall. Tilly's, whilst un-watchably annoying towards the end, decline into a lust for danger and violence as she falls for Rudy and seems unmoved by her husband's fate is genuinely disturbing, and there is some genuine tension here and there when the two leads are on the run. As far as relatively tacky but enjoyable pulp entertainment goes, The Getaway is your ticket out of here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Getaway is a remake of the 1970s movie with the same name starring Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. This time around with some minor changes the movie comes out pretty aggressively with excellent action scenes. The chemistry between Baldwin and Basinger sizzles as does the action in the sweltering Arizona and Texas deserts.James Woods and David Morse are pretty debonair as smartly dressed villains not to mention the brute character depiction of Rudy by Michael Madsen which he repeats in Reservoir Dogs many years later. The story is pretty good but character development and dialogues are pretty weak. Though no one can replace McQueen, Baldwin's caper is not that far behind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remakes are normally worse than the first versions, but this one is the exception. I saw the first version of "Getaway" twice starred by Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw, which was OK to me, but this new one with Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger is more credible in its plot and also in acting. Basinger made more credible the reason to betray his husband, Baldwin made more credible the reason why he stayed with his wife. In general both acted well and perhaps much better than McQueen and McGraw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not sure why but this is one of my favorite action movies. I watched it multiple times and find it extremely entertaining. I guess it has certain chemistry which is generated by Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger which works perfectly for me. I like their second movie ("Marrying Man") so I guess they are the reason. I was surprised to see all those negative comments here. I think this movie is so much better than most of the big and low budget crap nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rather better than expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd had this tape around for a while before finally viewing it on a slow night. My expectations were not high. I've always felt Jim Thompson was over rated, reviews had been generally poor and I'd heard that the earlier version (which I've yet to see)was better. Perhaps because I wasn't expecting too much I found myself enjoying it. There was enough plot momentum, weird characters and spectacular action, not to mention some steamy sex (no need to be shocked, I understand Baldwin and Basinger were married at the time) that it held my interest throughout.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kim Basinger makes the difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Way back when, pulp novelist genius Jim Thompson wrote "The Getaway." It was about a man and a woman who teamed up to rob. It has been filmed twice. About 12 people argue on IMDb about which is the better version. I am one of those arguing that the second version is better.The first version in 1972 was directed by Sam Peckinpah and had a stellar (at the time) cast including Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw. It was directed by Sam Peckinpah. Among the character actors were legends Al Letteiri, Ben Johnson, Sally Struthers and Slim Pickens.There is no doubt this is an outstanding movie.Here's the big difference -- Ali McGraw Vs. Kim Basinger. Kim B. blows Ali M. out of the water. Seriously, the whole contest rides on this and Kim so totally takes charge in the second movie there is no competition.I won't talk about the sex scene between Kim and Alec Baldwin, who is her husband. Why? They deserve their privacy. Even though we saw ... lots.Bottom line: This movie requires a tough broad. Ali McGraw? Fugeddabout it! No way. Kim, you relentless female tough woman, you rule here.Kim Basinger? This is a woman who does not look ridiculous handling a nine. But she's also vulnerable in the back of a garbage truck. Alec, you are one lucky guy.And, Richard Farnsworth has the role that Slim Pickens played in the original. Tough call. I say equal props.Bottom line? The remake has more ... coolness. 'Nuff said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Folks, why your reviews are so wordy and so empty the same time? This is the best motion picture I ever seen that shows that a real couple is all about. It just sets the mark.This film is about trust, love, devotion, honesty, tenderness, kindness, humanity after all. It shows good couple and bad couple, kind and evil. It is about forgiveness. It is about sharing.Yes, I didn't see the original. What for? I 've got the idea, I praise the play of Alec and Kim and the old guy. Why to judge between one good, kind story and another? This "good" is not good enough compared to the other? BS.This story sets the mark for a couple and the people, and the play is just superb. Final titles music is just superb as well.I wish I could have this kind of trust within my couple one day. If I ever do, I would be happy for the rest of my life.So, come on, folks, turn towards your good half of yourself, open you heart and say that this is a great movie to watch, to keep in your heart and to move on. If those two finally made it, maybe and I can make it one day.So... thank you, guys. 'Cause you just saved my heart again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Alec Baldwin is about the worst possible choice for this sort of role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like The Getaway are always fascinating to me on one level. That's because they demonstrate how important the most elemental and obvious choices in storytelling are and getting just one simple thing wrong can hamstring even the most talented filmmakers and performers. This movie is well written and nicely plotted. It has plenty of action and a couple of nice sex scenes. The cast is as good as you'll get for this sort of thing and the direction is unobjectionably competent. All of that goes almost entirely to waste, however, because the two main characters here are unsympathetic criminals whom the audience has no reason whatsoever to root for or care about what happens to them.Don't get me wrong. You can make a compelling and involving film about bad people. The star of every story doesn't have to be some selfless, noble champion of truth, justice and the American way. But if you're going to make a motion picture about a cold blooded villain, you've got to treat him as such and not try to pass him off as a hero. People like looking at sharks but they won't respond to you trying to pretend a great white shark is as cute and relatively harmless as a bottlenose dolphin.Carter "Doc" McCoy (Alec Baldwin) is a smart and stylish thief who can pretty much figure out how to get in anywhere to get anything. Teamed with his beautiful and devoted wife Carol (Kim Basinger), the two pass through a series of twists and turns until they end up on the run from a treacherous partner, some vengeance-seeking gunmen and the law enforcement. And let me stress again, all of that is well executed. Maybe The Getaway isn't a great action-adventure flick, but it's got all the right parts moving in all the right ways to be a very good one.None of it matters much because the movie never gives you a reason to really care if Doc and Carol live or die, succeed or fail, get caught and sent to prison or escape and live happily ever after. I don't think Doc does a single good or admirable thing until 90 minutes into the film. He's portrayed as a remorseless criminal who has not trouble at all assaulting an innocent cab driver or committing attempted murder by firing a shotgun at pursuing cops. The only good thing Carol does involved morally compromising herself to benefit Doc, which largely negates any credit she gets for being selfless.The Getaway rises and falls on one question. Why should the viewer cheer for Doc and Carol while booing their enemies? No explanation is ever provided, other than the charisma of its two stars. Well, Kim Basinger can project a fragile vulnerability like nobody's business but Carol is bound at the hip to Doc and for all of Alec Baldwin's dramatic and comedic abilities, he's never been a performer who radiated likability. At least not until he let himself get fat for TV. Now, I haven't seen the original and don't know how it handled the question of why people should care about these two characters. Maybe Steve McQueen could pull off what Baldwin couldn't or maybe the audience of the early 70s was more inclined to support unrepentant bad guys like Doc McCoy. This remake doesn't answer the question at all, let alone answer it badly.It would not be at all fair to call The Getaway a bad movie. It's never boring, the action scenes are pretty good and Basinger gets naked on more than one occasion, at least in the unrated version I saw. But I wouldn't have cared a whit if Doc and Carol had wound up dead in the desert instead of riding off into the sunset. I suppose someone else might like it much more than I, but I think the general reaction would be a shrug and the statement "Well, that was okay". In other words, if you've got nothing better to do, there are worse ways of wasting your time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's OK...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Getaway is a remake of the action classic that stared Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw. Now I haven't seen the original so I can't compare the two but by it self this is an OK action thriller. It goes old school with its desert/western setting, bad criminals and finale stand off. The story is simple Doc McCoy (Alec Baldwin), his wife (Kim Basinger) and his partner (Michael Madsen) are hired to get a man out of prison. When the job goes sour, McCoy is locked up for a year in a Mexican prison. With the help of his wife and a Phoenix crime boss Jack Benyon (James Woods), he released and hired to do one more job. This job goes semi good but after it has been done many people end up dead and the McCoys are on the run from many different people all with their eyes on the large amount of cash they have. The performances are OK. Baldwin is the American version of Pierce Brosnan. He's much more calm, composed and edgier than Pierce. Basinger is tough yet still has that soft side and she very good with guns. Madsen is a good mix with Baldwin and Basinger, he add the funny but villainous third part of the gang. The cast is bigger than normal for an action film but since this was made in the early ?90's some of the actors hadn't hit it big yet. Jennifer Tilly, Phillip Seymore Hoffman and David Morse round out the cast. They all have small parts but they do the best with what they have. The action is not really original and there are a few Woo slow-motion shots thrown in for good measure. There's only one explosion but a lot of guns. In the end The Getaway is an OK action movie that if it's on TV it would be enjoyable to watch, if there's nothing better on.</fullReview>

Later, Doc and Rudy commit yet another thousanddollar heist in a dog-racing track, only to be double-crossed.Along with the money, Doc and Carol are once again on the lam,going by truck and train, and armed to the teeth with a 12-gage.Though slow and dull at times, "The Getaway" has plenty ofsteamy substance and rousing action.

I think Alec Baldwin did a way better job than Steve McQueen ever did the in the original. I just bought the movie in Wal Mart just 3 months ago and I couldn't stop watching it!

		<shortDescription>The plan is shut up......</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doc McCoy is put in prison because his partner flew off without him after exchanging a prisoner for a lot of money. Doc knows Jack Benyon, a rich man, is up to something big, so he tells his wife to tell him that he's for sale if Benyon can get him out of prison. Benyon pulls some strings and Doc McCoy is released again. Unfortunately he has to cooperate with the same person that got him to prison.....It's one of those films that never needed to be remade, but at the time, I'm guessing Basinger And Baldwin were the biggest couple in Hollywood, so why not do it again? The Marrying Man made a bundle, as did Love Affair. Oh hang on...But the point of the film is to entertain, and it does, as its one of the best looking action movies of 1994, and for once it treats the audience as an adult and is suitable as an action movie or couples, which is really rare.Baldwin is on the right side of tubby, but he over broods and it really gets to you after a while. Basinger does what. She normally does and smolders like a forties movie star.The rest of the cast are just there for the pay check. Woods does his bad guy who is a little prolific role, and is just there to ignite the passion between the two leads characters, and Madsen features in a really gloomy depressing subplot involving Jennifer Tilly, and its pretty bizarre.The action is good and its edited with a lot of respect, it just feels a little strange, despite the fact its enjoyable and fun, it feels too hasty and rushed.A lot more could have been done.But the one saving grace is at least they never remade it with Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A retread remake with very little original stuff. Especially the dialog and set pieces are nothing more than a carbon creation with no imagination. There is some style and the film is palatable if not preferable to the original 1972 Sam Peckinpah/Jim Thompson movie. The much talked about Peckinpah violent chops have become standard Hollywood fare and there is nothing new here or even an attempt to time-stamp the presentation. This xerox of a film does cut and paste some new sex scenes but so what. It is explicit and erotic, but, it is the grit and the guts that makes it mark on the crime thriller and the sex is best left for the more lurid of these types. Alec Baldwin is prettier than Steve McQueen and Kim Basinger is prettier than Ali MacGraw.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well shot with some nice stunt work; sadly the script didn't live up to the mechanics of the filmmaking (more on that later). As far as performances go, well everyone did a pretty good job; Alec Baldwin was rough and tough as Carter 'Doc' McCoy and Kim Basinger did pretty well as Carol. Michael Madsen (with one of the great mullets) was pretty hateful as Rudy Travis and James Woods was masterful, as ever, as the evil Jack Benyon. Also worthy of note were; David Morse as Jim Deer Jackson, Jennifer Tilly as Fran Carvey, Richard Farnsworth as Slim and finally, sadly underused, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Frank Hansen (blink &amp; you'll miss him).A film that tries to deal with some quite adult themes but in the end falls quite short of the mark. There is just too much going on, the main characters are not likable enough and there's just no charisma between them. When I find myself looking at my watch I know it's a very bad sign and my watch has seldom been looked at quite so much. On the plus side, I did like the performance of James Woods, he was particularly loathsome; the trouble is, there wasn't enough of him. A poor effort over all; an A-list cast but a bit of a B-list movie I'm afraid?

		<shortDescription>One Film, Two Different Periods In Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The comments that I've read regarding the 2 films,"The Getaway", I feel, fail to take into consideration the differences in the time periods that each film was done. "The Getaway"(1972), starring Steve McQueen and Ali McGraw was remade in 1994 by then husband and wife Alec Baldwin and Kim Baseger. In remaking "The Getaway" the filmmaker(s) chose to use the same script, making only subtle changes so to fit in today's lifestyles, economically and socially. For instance, the amount of money they steal; in the original they rob a bank which nets them only 30-40 thousand dollars, which back than was a lot of money; however, today it wouldn't even be worth taking the risk for, so the script is modified, or modernized, so that they plan and carry out this huge heist of a racetrack, where they net a couple of million dollars, at least. There are even more subtle changes like this made in the 1994 movie, but everything else about the two is almost identical; even down to the dialogue, which I thought rather odd.One of the comments I read, said that the second version was much better than the first; that they felt it more exciting and the first one had 'put them to sleep'. I can see this happening, if you're watching the two films the same way. These are two films that you just can't watch the same way. Of course something reflexing our world and lifestyles of 20+ years ago is going to bore you to sleep, because unless you were living back than, you can't relate to 'that world'. The only way you can watch these two films is with the desire to 'examine and study' them for this differences.; see how the filmmaker of one time period developed the story compared/contrasted with the other. If you're not interested in learning these differences, than don't look at both films because you're going to come up with the same conclusions everytime, I'm afraid.</fullReview>

Plus many of the scenes looked like an acting class that decided to use the scenes from the original as their scripted material. There was no tension and much of the subtext just disappeared. Still, there was good use of some character actors like Richard Farnsworth slotted into some of the smaller key roles and it was nice to pick up on some of the references to the original film. However, the overall viewing experience was far less fulfilling than the original, that kicked ass from start to finish.Also, do dog race tracks really hold huge amounts of money like that?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Picture is a good remake of the Steve McQueen classic and has plenty of good action scenes, chases and double-crosses. Master thief Alec Baldwin and comely wife Kim Basinger are the main focus of the plot as they blast their way out of trouble in one scene after another. The two desperadoes spend most of the film on the run, resulting in the usual car chases and shoot-outs and serial-style close calls. Perhaps the film's high point is an exciting shoot-out in a hotel in a border town with a vengeful ex-partner. The movie is a rugged, macho film in which distrust is the watchword among the principals. James Woods is very good in an especially sinister role as a crime boss and Michael Madsen is also good as former pal who's out to even up an old score. Baldwin and Basinger somehow don't really click together here but do well enough to make the movie worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Needless, Unenjoyable And Unnecessary Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen this movie in ages but figured I'd comment on it anyway, mostly because the memory of disliking it so intently is burned into my memory cells. The original THE GETAWAY was no prize to begin with but at least had the distinctions of being 1) A Sam Peckinpah movie, 2) Featured Steve McQueen, Ben Johnson, and Slim Pickens, 3) Was a relatively painless way to blow away an hour and a half of time.By comparison, the 1994 version comes across as little more than a vanity piece for the then red hot Alec Baldwin and his soon to be divorced wife, Kim Basinger. McQueen and his then wife Allie McBride also split up soon after their version of the film was made and one can sort of picture the Baldwins at their marriage councilor arguing over who's stupid idea it was to make this movie.Let's just get it said and out of the way -- Alec Baldwin never was and never will be anything close to the Cooler King, and one of the reasons why this remake annoyed me so much is the perceived arrogance on Baldwin's part to presume to challenge our memory of Steve McQueen in the lead role. Like someone else points out, Peckinpah's 1972 vision of the film was a satire piece meant to sort of parody the action/adventure heist genre. By contrast Baldwin, Bassinger &amp; company seem to be trying to evoke a more serious tone, with only Michael Madsen's and James Woods' slimy unprincipled villain characters coming off as real people.The movie is also decidedly mean spirited and unlikeable at a fundamental level that is difficult to put into words. One viewing was more than enough, not just because it didn't have anything new to offer but because of how artlessly it was made. Peckinpah's movie was actually a stylish little entertainment that had an upbeat mood, where this version is a slog that takes too long to amount to little or nothing. There's no artistic urgency to it's existence and some of the more uncomfortable scenes are so uncomfortable that they make the film difficult to enjoy.So I don't know, this was probably one of the films that helped to initiate the wave of pointless, artistically vapid big budget remakes propped up around a then name brand actor/actress, which in itself isn't a really good thing. I'd always rather see a filmmaker at least try to come up with a new idea for a movie &amp; fall flat with something original. This movie just made me want to pull my eyebrows out, and it's revealing that over the ensuing 15 years since it's release Mr. Baldwin has become widely renowned as one of the biggest jerks in Hollywood. Thank god for "Team America" for putting him in his place.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The 'enfant terribles' of Hollywood in forgettable remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back when Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger were a mercurial, hot-tempered, high-powered Hollywood couple they filmed this (nearly) scene-for-scene remake of the 1972 Steve McQueen-Ali MacGraw action-thriller about a fugitive twosome. It almost worked the first time because McQueen was such a vital presence on the screen--even stone silent and weary, you could sense his clock ticking, his cagey magnetism. Baldwin is not in Steve McQueen's league; although he has his charms, and is arguably a more versatile actor than McQueen, this material isn't the proper showcase for Baldwin's attributes. Basinger does well and certainly looks good, but James Woods is artificially hammy in a silly mob-magnet role. A sub-plot involving another couple taken hostage by Baldwin's ex-partner was unbearable in the '72 film and plays even worse here. As for the action scenes, they're pretty old hat, which causes one to wonder: why even remake the original? ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You can't beat the original. This is proof.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First things first: this is an action movie. Really. I don't know why YOU watch action movies, but I watch them for the action. There are several elements that help the action, the most influential being the atmosphere. The atmosphere of the original 'Getaway' was one of the most moving forces. It was dark, gritty, violent, and at times funny. Doc wasn't the clean-cut pretty boy ex-con (contradition-in-terms) that he is in this movie. He was a unforgiving killer and thief, but at least he loved his wife. This wasn't the 'stare-into-each-others-eyes' love you see in movies these days. This is the kind that real, true blue, thick-and-thin love.This movie doesn't get any of this right. The worst heresy is the ending scene in the hotel when Doc and wife run into the Sheriff and the criminal and a shootout erupts. While the original didn't have special effects, they had atmosphere and pacing. Doc held his firearm correctly, the shooting erupted instead of people sneaking around to shoot each other in the back, and still, everyone died, horrible, gruesome deaths. Not here.Instead we get two very clean-cut people 'hunting' the other criminals like Elmer Fudd in Bugs Bunny cartoons. The criminals are doing the same and (with no one holding their gun in a safe manner) when they FINALLY meet... their guns jam, lock, or get stuck in an elevator. I literally fell asleep at this point. Sorry, dude, but i have to give this a 1 out of 5. Watch the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The only thing flawless in this movie is Kim Bassenger's makeup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>SPOILERS THROUGHOUT: The Gettaway is mostly an action movie. And what action there is to!! Shootouts, chases, dumpsters and much much more. It stars Kim Bassenger and Alec Baldwin as the Mc Coy's.This is a remake and I have not seen the original but really didn't care for this one at all although Bassenger and Baldwin have some nice screen chemistry. But the movie itself didn't do it for me.The Gettaway became really tiresome really quickly. The plot is overshadowed by one fight/chase after another and as the violence keeps piling up, Bassenger and Baldwin retain their great looks no matter what perils they maybe in. In fact, by the end of the movie they almost look BETTER then in the beginning. I don't think Bassenger's eye makeup moves once during the whole picture.This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, certainly not, but it isn't very good and unless one is an action movie purist I can't see really enjoying this movie because there's just not a lot here. The Gettaway isn't terribly original either, and goes every way from unnecessarily brutal to rather dull. It really could have been better I think.Bassenger and Baldwin give OK performances but they don't have a lot to do except get chased and run for their lives. Sometimes less is more, after seeing the same thing over and over again it gets stale. Didn't enjoy this one to much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>There was no need to remake it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I cannot see why filmmakers remade this movie. The 1972 movie with McQueen and McGraw is almost a classic. Steve McQueen was an outstanding actor and Baldwin is only an inadequate actor. He has no passion in his play.Also the action in the original "Getaway" was fantastic. But the remake has no action! It is almost boring despite the fact that the film-making in 1972 was more difficult than in 1994. I don't understand the way that Baldwin imprisoned from Mexico. I think this is a mistake in the story.So i think that there was no need to remake it, or if they decided to remake a classic, they must choose an excellent actor for the first role, like Johnny Depp or Brad Pitt...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent, worth one semi-attentive viewing at best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I haven't been able to find the original Sam Peckinpah film of '72, though it's not for lack of trying. I've been trying to see a Peckinpah film for quite some time, after hearing quite a lot about his directorial talent. When this film came on TV, after missing it about five showings so far, I decided to check it out. After all, it's got James Woods and Michael Madsen in the cast, both portraying criminals... that can't be all bad, right? Not all bad, no, but certainly not very good, either. The film ranges somewhere between half-bad and almost good. It's somewhat good, but it loses momentum less than half-way through, and it's hard to watch attentively from that point on. Truth is, it just doesn't really have anything we haven't seen before. Couple of criminals get together to rob a place, some of them try to keep the loot for themselves... they all run. So what? We never really get a reason why these particular criminals should be important, why we should care about them. The film ends up just being a decent heist movie with a good cast. The plot is nothing special or even slightly original. The pacing is bad, and even the most patient people will lose interest sooner or later. The acting is pretty good. The characters are somewhat well-written, but they aren't fleshed out properly, and are in the end just dull and uninteresting. The action is OK, but there are plenty of better action-flicks out there. Basically, this isn't really worthwhile, but I guess it's decent for a single, half-attentive viewing. Bonus for those who do muster up the effort to watch: both female attractive cast members, Kim Basinger and Jennifer Tilly get naked for some scenes. I recommend this to fans of any of the principal actors, possibly the genre and possibly the director. 6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Don't even bother with this movie, it's bad when judged on it's own merits, but when compared to the 1972 original (which IS a classic) it's down right awful. And BTW, somebody commented that the 1972 movie is bad when compared to the book. This is silly, movies should never be judged against the books they are taken from. They are 2 completely different art forms (as if this needed to be pointed out but apparently it does). If you used this criteria for all movies then "2001" would suck and so would "Forest Gump" and "Silence of the Lambs".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nowhere near the original. It's quite accurate copy bringing nothing new to the story. But the directing is very poor. Basinger is weak - without good directing. Baldwin is simply just a second league compared to McQueen. I watched it just out of curiosity, being a huge fan of Peckinpah's masterpiece, and I got what I thought. Almost a B movie with second rate acting and directing. I wasn't even disappointed, I just don't know what they were trying to do. This remake doesn't try to play with the original material, it's not a tribute and indeed it lacks some really good actor of its era.It reminds me of a bad xerox copy of wonderful photograph.This is a complete waste of your time. Save yourself 2 hours or watch the original (again:)))</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why do filmmakers do remakes?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Any one who saw the original would have to go out and destroy this dreadful remake. Alex Baldwin trying to imitate the late Steve Mcqueen in a word for word remake just doesn't work. While Baldwin has done some admirable work this is a flop from start to finish. McQueen had charisma, never try to compete with a star. As for Kim in the role of Ali McGraw enough said. McQueen looked dangerous, menacing and believable as Doc, the film had excitement and suspense,Baldwin and company made this into a comedy,I laughed the one and only time I saw this miserable film. And that dreadful hairstyle for Michael Madsen who is one of today's more exciting and believable actors! Did the makeup people have it in for Michael, what were they thinking.If you wish to see movie-making the way it was under Sam Peckinpah's direction Get the original!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The original was bad enough, this is worse!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1972 original Thompson's classic book was ruinously adapted for the silverscreen. This remake manages to be even worse. If it was possible I would give this movie a negative rating. The remake's worst sin is that now the book will never be properly made into a movie.The problem of both versions is that a highly original story was transformed into a typical Hollywood schlock 'star vehicle'. Read the book or see the Grifters or the Wild Bunch</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Get Away! Get Away!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original 1972 Sam Peckinpah version of "The Getaway" might have its flaws, but this remake has nothing but flaws.To begin with, Alec Baldwin is no Steve McQueen. He's not even a Butterfly McQueen. His version of Doc is as dull as McQueen's is watchable. Kim Basinger fares a bit better, but then again Ali MacGraw was never all that great an actress to begin with either.The only strengths of this movie are James Woods and Michael Madsen as the bad guys--and its as nice to see Richard Farnsworth in this version as it was seeing Slim Pickens in the original.But screenwriter Amy Holden Jones is no Walter Hill, Baldwin is no McQueen and director Roger Donaldson is at best a journeyman, certainly no Peckinpah.When you see this in the pile of cheapo videos at Walmart, throw it back. Get away!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another example as to why Alec Baldwin is my favourite.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think remakes should only be done if the original can be improved upon. This film makes the original look like a junior high school production. Alec Baldwin did a much better job than Steve Mcqueen playing Doc McCoy. I was never bored during this film. The original Getaway put me to sleep. I can watch this film over and over again. Definitely one for my collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Movie is as Bad as Kim Basinger's Legs !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What's in here ?! Let me tell you. It's the presence of (Alec Baldwin). He's not a great actor but maybe a nice star with some good movies which this is not one of them. He did nothing here more than anything he did before or after. So not to mention (literally !) the matter of (Steve McQueen) being at the same role in the original because I don't want to make that comparison in the first place. I'm not a big fan or even a fan of (Kim Basinger), she got a lot of bad movies on her and even at her best she looks average ! And it gets on my nerve indeed whenever they talk about her seductive rare beauty !!?? Well, if being a blond would make anyone captivating then I'll dye my hair in yellow as soon as possible ! And what is it with all the craziness over miss Basinger's Legs ??!! It's surely insanity or bad tasting ? As I don't see them both as not sexy only, but UGLY too ! And if you hate that so shoot me down but you know what ?! I've just watched this movie so I'm dead already !. Yet, what would make you really suffer in unbearable way is that nothing of the credits goes to the one she deserves the most?And of course I mean (Jennifer Tilly)..Now we're talking about a true genuine seductive chick with such unforgettable body and one unique sense of allurement like a nasty brunette (Marilyn Monroe) however much more healthier !! (I can't help it, she was the only new and watchable thing in here !). (Michael Madsen) as the bad guy was much appealing as well as effective more than the good guys, (James Woods) is here to summarize the early events beside the pool (so the trailer would be by his voice later !) and he knew before all that this is a whole Hollywood's stuff so "Do your thing, take your cash, and good luck as an actor in other movies !", the editing gave the movie a serious personality along with violent atmosphere done by suitable shining cinematography, so the main goods of it (The action, The thrill, ..) are here and fairly well-made, though any echo for deep meanings about (the kinds of betrayal) as the main dramatic motif of the whole thing is not that strong so don't wait for it. OK, it's all in all another remake without anything special (Except Jennifer Tilly's spicy moments !) so I think I tried to be objective as much as I could therefore I shouldn't end my review saying that (Basinger) or anyone here did better than this movie.. It would be an insult because frankly.. Anything is better than this movie!</fullReview>
