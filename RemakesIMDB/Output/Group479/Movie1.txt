		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney gives a memorable performance in a most unusual role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I was a kid I was an avid reader of Forrest J. Ackerman's Famous Monsters of Filmland magazine, and it was there I first heard about the director Tod Browning. He and his work were prominently featured in the pages of FM, where the (still missing) London After Midnight was often lamented as the Holy Grail of lost films. There were also frequent references to The Unholy Three in both its silent and talkie incarnations. It took me decades to finally catch up with the silent version, and my response is kind of schizo; objectively, I'm aware that in a number of ways it's absurd, and yet it's great fun, and highly entertaining. And the main reason the movie works so well, I believe, is the sheer charisma of Lon Chaney.Chaney and Browning worked together many times, but this was their biggest box office success. Despite the general impression to the contrary their collaborations were not exactly horror films. In fact, as far as I can determine not one of their movies featured any supernatural elements; even the vampire of London After Midnight turns out to be a police inspector in disguise. Most of the Browning/Chaney films are crime melodramas with bizarre details stirred into the mix, often involving people from the lowest rungs of show business, such as circuses and carnivals. Chaney's characters in these stories are often afflicted with an intense, unrequited passion for a young woman (most memorably and disturbingly in The Unknown), and his behavior and actions are affected by this obsession, usually to his disadvantage, sometimes fatally so.By the time The Unholy Three was produced Browning had developed his recurring themes and motifs into a highly effective, time-tested formula. His directorial technique is stylish in an unobtrusive way: for special emphasis he'll highlight shadows thrown on a wall, forming a silhouette of the three title characters, but otherwise he generally avoids flamboyant touches. With a story like this, he doesn't need them. The synopsis has been outlined elsewhere, but briefly it involves a trio of crooks from the sideshow world: Professor Echo the ventriloquist (Chaney) who disguises himself as an old lady, a strong man (Victor MacLaglen), and a midget (Harry Earles) who masquerades as a baby. A pet store serves as a front for their activities. The trio is actually is quintet, as they are accompanied by a thief named Rosie (Mae Busch) and a bespectacled patsy named Hector (Matt Moore) who is somehow oblivious that his employers are, well, not what they seem. Hector takes everything in stride. It's perfectly normal to him that the pet shop where he works offers not only birds and rabbits but also a dangerous gorilla in a big cage. So hey, if Hector takes it for granted, why shouldn't we? The plot turns on a jewel heist that goes awry, in part because of Prof. Echo's jealousy over Rosie. However, in this film the story is secondary to the sinister atmospherics.While it's Chaney's performance that drives the film the supporting cast is solid -- more so, I feel, than in the talkie remake -- and the characters' interactions have a "rightness" that persuades us to overlook numerous credibility issues. As in the best Hitchcock films, we're willing to ignore gaping plot holes in order to savor the set pieces. One of the most effective sequences features a police inspector who interrogates the trio in the wake of the jewel heist. He's unaware that the jewels he seeks are inside a toy elephant at his feet, a toy that supposedly belongs to the "baby." The scene is suspenseful and funny, and, for me, the sight of Harry Earles disguised as a baby is almost as creepy as anything in an out-and-out horror movie.The unlikely twists increase to the point of craziness in the final scenes, yet the story follows the consistent internal logic of a deeply weird dream. It's no surprise this was such a big hit in its day. I was fortunate enough to see a newly restored print of this film at the Museum of Modern Art this summer, back to back with the talkie remake. The silent version in particular went over quite well, though admittedly there were chuckles when a title card glibly announces the outcome of Prof. Echo's trial. Afterward in the lobby viewers were enthusiastic about the film, and about Lon Chaney. Seventy-five years after his death audiences are still impressed with his magnetism. So here's a tip of the hat to Forry Ackerman, who saw the Browning/Chaney films when they were new, and was right about this one all along!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Chaney Chiller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vowing revenge on the world of ?normal' people, a sideshow ventriloquist, strong man &amp; dwarf band together as THE UNHOLY THREE.Following Lon Chaney's great film successes at Universal Studios, Irving Thalberg managed to entice the actor to come to MGM. Anxious to repeat the box office bonanzas of Chaney's recent past, Thalberg signed a one-picture deal with Chaney's favorite director, Tod Browning. The resulting film, THE UNHOLY THREE, was such a hit that Thalberg quickly signed Browning for a long-term contract.Based on a story by Tod Robbins (who would also pen the inspiration for FREAKS), Browning would give the film an appropriately menacing atmosphere, with flashes of comedic wit at just the right intervals. A crime caper rather than a horror film, the chills are saved for right near the end with the rampages of a ferocious ape (actually a chimpanzee, photographed out of proportion) which no one seems surprised to find in a bird store.While ventriloquism may seem an odd pastime to depict in a silent movie, Chaney made it all seem so sensible. A consummate artist who only now is starting to receive the proper accolades, Chaney did not need to contort limb or face to portray a little old lady. All he needed was a wig &amp; a dress. So well was he received in this role that it was chosen to be remade five years later as Chaney's talking debut.Muscular Victor McLaglen (a British Army champion athlete) and tiny Harry Earles (one of the few adult actors who could disguise himself as a baby) give very solid support as Chaney's wicked cronies; much of the favorable outcome of the film is due to them.Pensive Mae Busch scores as the waifish pickpocket allied with Chaney; this very talented actress would get to shine a few years later in a series of appearances with Laurel &amp; Hardy. In his one scene as a stern judge, Edward Connelly lends his saturnine presence to the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Unholy Three" (MGM, 1925), directed by Tod Browning, is the kind of movie only Lon Chaney could do best, playing a tough guy with a good heart, donning a disguise or two, and coming out with one of the film's famous lines, "That's all there is to life, folks, just a little laugh, just a little tear." In reality, it's a change of pace for Chaney from his previous efforts, playing a tough but sympathetic character in a crime drama.The story features three museum freaks, Hercules, the strong man (Victor McLaglen), Tweeledee, the dwarf (Harry Earles), and Professor Echo, the ventriloquist (Lon Chaney), performing in a sideshow while Echo's girl, Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch) goes through the crowd picking pockets. When Echo comes upon an idea of a get-rich-quick scheme, he, Hercules, Tweeledee and Rosie become partners in crime as THE UNHOLY THREE. They then open a store stocked with parrots that will not talk, but Echo, disguised as Granny O'Grady, the proprietress, arranges to have the parrots "talk" only in his presence. His gal Rosie acts as "Granny's grand-daughter," with Tweeledee is disguised as Rosie's infant son and Hercules as the "infant's" uncle. With the shop as a front, THE UNHOLY THREE rob the homes of their well-to-do customers, especially when they telephone to complain that the parrots they brought does not talk, thus, having Granny and the "baby" paying them a visit and casing the place for a possible late night robbery. Also working in the shop is Hector McDonald (Matt Moore), who becomes interested in Rosie but is unaware of the operation.Watching Lon Chaney disguised as a sweet little old lady is priceless, almost reminiscent to Tod Browning's latter melodrama of the sound era, "The Devil Doll" (MGM, 1936) in which Lionel Barrymore appeared as an escaped convict dressed as an elderly woman to elude the law, a role Chaney would have done, I'm sure, had he lived. Chaney would play Echo again in his one and only talkie of 1930 bearing the same title. With both films readily available for viewing on Turner Classic Movies, one can see and compare both versions, in spite of some changes in parts in the continuity. Along with Chaney, midget Harry Earles also repeats his Tweeledee performance.When "The Unholy Three" was presented on public television's 13-week series tribute to MGM, "Movies, Great Movies" in 1973, its host, Richard Schickel mentioned that this 1925 version was Lon Chaney's personal favorite of all his movies and one of MGM's biggest hits of that year. It's a grand performance worthy of the "master of disguises." Although a silent movie, one would wish to hear how the Echo character would throw his voice around to fool his customers. (Watch the 1930 talkie and find out).Also interesting is seeing a young Victor McLaglen, the future Best Actor winner of 1935's "The Informer," still rugged but a little thinner; Mae Busch (famous for her variety of roles in several Laurel and Hardy comedy shorts and features for Hal Roach in the 1930s), usually playing a tough gal, here playing against type as a co-starring love interest; and Matthew Betz as Inspector Regan. Tod Browning's direction should not go unnoticed, with one interesting scene having Chaney discussing his future plans in forming THE UNHOLY THREE to his supporters, as presented on screen in silhouettes, looking something like a "film noir" crook drama of the 1940s.The 1925 version of THE UNHOLY THREE, clocked at 86 minutes, currently includes the same orchestral scoring on Turner Classic Movies that was composed and originally chosen for the October 12, 1973, public television presentation of "Movies, Great Movies" a 13-week series tribute to MGM's 50th anniversary of its silent movies from the 1920s, as hosted by Richard Schickel. A worthy rediscovery to Lon Chaney's filmography of MGM successes (1924-1930). (***)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A great film...period. Lon Chaney heads a group of three thieves/carnival performers as they masquerade as an old woman, a man, and a baby in a pet shop where they sell birds that talk only by ventriloquism. Once the owners get home they see the birds no longer talk and the thieves are invited into their opulent homes. Tod Browning, the director of Dracula, does a marvelous job with this film. There are scenes that are just fantastic, the best of which for me is the courtroom scene. Browning gets a lot of help, however, by some real good performances. Chaney turns in a complex performance of a ventriloquist in love, yet evil, yet with some slight conscience. The scene in the courtroom where he deliberates helping Hector is acting at its best. Throw in a great job by Mae Busch and little Harry Earles as a cigar-smoking midget disguised as a baby. The silent film is a lost art only in that we no longer view it, talk about it, review it like it should. This film and the performances within should be seen not heard.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Unholy Three is a magnificent piece of filmmaking. The actors really fit into their roles. The mixture of thriller, comedy and drama is perfect. Tod Browning shows his talents. This film deserves to be shown more. I saw it at the Umea Filmfestival this September with newly written live music that made a great movie even better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unholy Three (1925) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had an afternoon free so I decided to watch the two versions of this Lon Chaney classic back to back, beginning with this one -- Tod Browning's silent original. It's the story of a crooked carnival ventriloquist (Lon Chaney) who teams up with the midget (Harry Earles) and strong man (Victor McLaglen ) for a series of robberies. Chaney dresses as an old woman and Earles plays a baby to perfect their scheme. In many ways this was a precursor to the popular Little Rascals/Our Gang short subject FREE EATS, where a couple of gangsters act as parents to a couple of little people dressed as infants, mistakenly referred to as "fidgets".Whether it's the silent version or sound remake, I thought this was a wildly entertaining story either way, though it's difficult to fairly judge one film or the other when they're viewed together so closely like this. There are pros and cons to both movies for me. The strength of Browning's silent version was that in many ways it felt much more stylish and better crafted, possibly with better production values... but I found I preferred Lila Lee as Rosie O'Grady (from the sound version) to the silent actress here, Mae Busch. The 1925 original perhaps feels a little too long, which is the only thing which kept it from being perfect for me. I wouldn't be surprised, though, if most fans prefer the silent film simply because it was directed by Tod Browning. My advice is to see them both! ***1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Browning Version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In an effort to make more money than they do as traveling carnival show attractions, velvet-voiced ventriloquist Lon Chaney (as Echo), baby-impersonating dwarf Harry Earles (as Tweedledee), and strongman Victor McLaglen (as Hercules) team up to form a gang of jewel thieves who call themselves "The Unholy Three". The crooked trio begins operating out of a bird shop run by Mr. Chaney, posing as sweet "Granny O'Grady", mother of pickpocket and gang moll Mae Busch (as Rosie). The front works like a charm, but Ms. Busch attracts the attention of straight-flying Matt Moore (as Hector), who forms a "love triangle" with Chaney. Then, an unexpected murder brings further unwelcome advances... from the police. This was re-made as Chaney's first - and only, unhappily - sound feature, in 1930. Of the many Chaney hits, "The Unholy Three" seemed like the most obvious one to improve with sound; and, Chaney's performance in both is stellar. While the later version has problems, Chaney enhanced his already incredible performance. In this one, frequent collaborator/director Tod Browning is definitely an asset. Also remarkable is Mr. Earle, who hadn't mastered English for the re-make, but seemed fine by "Freaks" (1932); his wicked, cigar-smoking baby is classic."The Unholy Three" (1925) was honored as one of its year's best pictures at "Film Daily" (#2), Motion Picture Magazine (#3), and The New York Times (#3) - after winners "The Gold Rush", "The Big Parade", and "The Last Laugh". At Motion Picture, Chaney's individual performance ranked third (after "Best Actor" Emil Jannings and runner-up John Gilbert). The film is perversely appealing - which was then, and is now, a Chaney/Browning hallmark.******** The Unholy Three (8/16/25) Tod Browning ~ Lon Chaney, Mae Busch, Harry Earles, Matt Moore</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That's all there is to life just a little laugh a little tear</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney was one of the greatest actors who ever lived. He expresses more emotion in this movie with his facial expressions than many of the actors today can do with their voices. Chaney stars as Professor Echo,a sleazy carnival ventriloquist, who plans to pull off a crime that would make him and his two counterparts rich. Echo a master of voices will pose as an old lady, the sideshow midget named Tweedledee will be the baby, and Hercules the strongman will be a bystander. Together this team of unholy individuals open up a pet store which specializes in selling talking parrots. These birds talk and sing in the store but when the buyer brings them home they stop.A rich man named Arlington buys a parrot and calls "Old Lady Mcgrady" to come have a look at it. Tweedledee notices a red ruby necklace."Don't worry Grannie will buy you a nice set of red pearls like that" Echo's girlfriend Rosie is falling in love with Hector the employee at the store. Echo is beginning to lose his concentration and his partners plot against him. Hercules murders Arlington and after Hector proposes to Rosie Echo plans to frame him for the murder.Yes the plot is a bit silly at times but Chaney and his cast tell it with the utmost sincerity. Chaney's Echo is a sad character,not necessarily evil but selfish. His love for Rosie redeems him and his evil ways at the end of the movie. Chaney is one of the greats. He creates a vivid character. Man of a Thousand Faces is the correct title for him but here he doesn't need his make-up to create a face just his perfect acting skills.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd and Engaging</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This Lon Chaney vehicle, directed by the great Tod Browning, is the story of three circus performers who begin to thieve jewels. They open a shop that sells parrots as a front. Chaney, a ventriloquist, dresses up as an old woman, one of his cohorts a man posing as the old woman's son, and the third, a midget, as his infant son (one of the major reasons to see this flick is that the same midget, here named Tweedledeedee, also plays Hans, the midget who marries the acrobat Cleopatra in Browning's later masterpiece, Freaks; in this film he actually is seen smoking a giant cigar, which, in Freaks, his fiancee suggested that he shouldn't smoke). One other circus performer, a woman, knows about their plans. Chaney loves her, but she doesn't reciprocate his feelings. The Unholy Three also hire a young dufus to help with the store. In case they get into trouble, they can always pin it on that guy. The store also sports a chimpanzee, humorously filmed so that he seems as big as a gorilla (when it is to walk through a doorway, it walks through a smaller doorway, for instance, than the actors do).The story of the film is very interesting. It can also can be quite funny, quite suspenseful, and quite pathetic, especially when Chaney is trying to court the young woman. There's at least one masterful sequence, where a policeman almost discovers the jewels the gang has stolen. They hide it in a toy elephant, which amuses the officer very much. The film also uses ventriloquism quite marvelously - I assume that a lot of the audience of this film in 1925 only knew of ventriloquism by second-hand knowledge - they just knew that ventriloquists could throw their voices, not knowing what it would actually look or sound like. In a silent movie then, you could take full advantage of the audience's ignorance. When Madame O'Grady (Chaney's aka) is trying to sell parrots that don't actually talk as talking parrots, she throws her voice to fool the customers. Browning actually shows that the parrots are supposed to be speaking by drawing speech bubbles on the film in front of the birds! The climax also uses ventriloquism wonderfully: Chaney throws his voice to a man who is on the stand, apparently testifying - he moves his lips, but Chaney supplies the voice. Of course, we know that's ridiculous, but only a few in 1925 would have scoffed. 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take into context</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Compared to many films of today, yes, the movie is a bit slow moving. But if you take it into the context of the time, I think this movie is fantastic! Think of it, this was similar to the 'Silence of the Lambs" or "Sixth Sense" of our time! I know this was one of the best movies of 1925, according to the box office counts, so if you take it in that context, WOW! This is a great movie! I personally liked all three of the main "bad guys" (especially Harry Earles as Tweedledee, the midget.), and, if you've seen the 1930 version, I think this "Rosie" is much better than the 1930 Lila Lee "Rosie" (sorry, I blanked). Anyway, a great movie that any good crime movie-lover or silent movie-lover should check out. Check out Turner Classic Movies, as they frequently run it</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Caper Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Unholy Three" is not a Lon Chaney horror film but rather an interesting crime caper drama.We meet the main characters in a seedy side show. First is Echo the ventriloquist (Chaney) his "girl friend" and pick pocket artist Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch), strongman Hercules (Victor McLaglan) and baby faced midget Tweedledee (Harry Earles). Echo, fed up with the carnival life devises a plan whereby he, Hercules and Tweedldee would become the Unholy Three and commit a series of robberies. Echo disguises himself as "Grandma" Moses and the midget as her baby grand daughter. They hire wimpish Hector McDonald (Matt Moore) who is unaware of the goings on, to run the store.The cover if you will, is a bird shop (really?) where Echo uses his ventriloquist skills to convince rich customers to buy what they think is a talking parrot. Later when the customer discovers that the bird cannot talk they call "Grandma" Moses who goes to their home to case the place for a robbery. Hector develops a crush on Rosie and she at first doesn't reciprocate. The robberies are going well for the group until one night when Rosie shows interest in Hector. The three are about to embark on another robbery when Echo showing his jealousy, stays behind to spoil Rosie's date. Hercules and the midget proceed on their own but in their haste murder the victim Mr. Arlington (Charles Wellesley). Echo is furious but goes along with the plan of pinning the crime on the hapless Hector.The trio and Rosie flee to an isolated cabin as Hector is arrested for the murder. Then it gets interesting.Lon Chaney as usual disappears into his character(s). His depiction of the aged grandmother is another of his great characterizations. He literally becomes a convincing old lady. His Echo displays a wide range of emotions through Chaney's remarkable pantomime talents: dominance, fear, hate, kindness, cruelty etc. The romance between Rosie and Hector is a little hard to believe given her background. Hector does mention at one point though, that he too has a past but does not elaborate.Given that Echo saves Hector, one has to wonder why he was not charged with the robberies but seems to get off scott free. Does Chaney get the girl in the end, what do you think?Remade as a sound feature in 1930.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>if you're like me, you're thinking "why bother?" about this film. Give it a chance !! it drew me in, was never boring, was original, interesting and truly a very good movie -- yes, even though it's silent. At times, it's even pretty funny !! I feel so strongly about it that i wish it was on again so that i could catch the whole thing (watched 2/3).The acting and the atmosphere are top notch. It's definitely not one of those cliché ridden, predictable schlock movies. The man playing the "baby" is fascinating !! So innocent and convincing one second, then chomping his cigar and acting menacing the next. I give it 3 1/2 out of 4 stars -- i really liked this picture !! I can't think of one downside to it. High praise from me !! And the "baby face Finster" character (gangster midget !!) is a scream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is quite the entertaining movie but to say the characters and events in the story defy credibility is probably an understatement. Which might lead you to wonder whether this was a crime story, a suspense story or just one with a bunch of oddball characters in it. Directed by Tod Browning in his first collaboration with MGM, the film is somewhat of a precursor to his 1932 film 'Freaks', which has more fantastic characters on display in an even more bizarre tale.Browning sets up the action with a quick view of circus performers to whet the viewer's appetite for strangeness; there's an immense fat lady, a tattooed woman, a sword swallower and Siamese twins, all to get us ready for Professor Echo (Lon Chaney), an otherwise normal looking ventriloquist, Hercules the strongman (Victor McLaglen), and midget performer Tweedledee (Harry Earles). I got a kick out of a circus patron's remark to her young son to refrain from smoking cigarettes if he ever wants to grow up to be a strong man like Hercules. Hercules responds by lighting up a cigarette as the customers walk away.Professor Echo uses his ventriloquism gimmick in more ways than one; as part of his newly established criminal enterprise, pet shop customers are enticed to buy talking parrots that seem to clam up once they're brought to their new home. Disguised as a sweet old lady with a young baby in tow, Echo cases the premises of his customers, and his partners rob whatever money or jewelry they can get their hands on. When one of their victims wind up murdered, they abandon the shop and head off to a remote cabin to wait out the authorities. Complicating this entire scenario however is a love triangle of sorts. Not only does the Professor fall for pretty Rosie O'Grady (Mae Busch), so does shop employee Hector McDonald (Matt Moore).Though there are some suspenseful scenes throughout the story, others will leave you rather perplexed and scratching your head. The courtroom scene requires major suspension of disbelief, and you'll wind up wondering how and why the chimp from the pet shop seems to transform into a vicious ape at the hideout cabin. I guess you have to take it on faith that the snarling monkey settled the score with Hercules and Little Willie because they don't make it to the end of the picture.But you know, through it all the story is an entertaining one, and I'd be remiss if I didn't mention how the individual players reminded me of more current movie actors. Depending on the way the camera presented Rosie O'Grady, Miss Busch resembled Terri Garr quite a bit, while Victor McLaglen and Lon Chaney both brought to mind first, a middle aged, and then a slightly older Tommy Lee Jones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The sort of movie only that could only have been made by Tod Browning</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be trite, but nonetheless true, to assert that this movie could not be produced today. Only the mind of filmmaker Tod Browning, who came to the world of film making from a background in carnivals and circuses, could have conceived of a story this bizarre. Only a great actor like Lon Chaney could do justice to the dual role of Echo the ventriloquist/Gramdma O'Grady. Above all, of course, today it would be considered unthinkable to utilize an actor like the inimitable Harry Earles, particularly cast in the role of a villain. But then this film was the product of the equally inimitable Tod Browning, the man who subsequently created the notorious movie "Freaks, which also featured the unique talents of Harry Earles. The story involves three side show performers; Echo the Ventriloquist (Lon Chaney), Hercules the Strong Man (future Academy Award Winner Victor Mclaglen) and Tweedledee the Midget (Harry Earles). Fed up with life on the midway, the "Unholy Three" team up to open up a pet shop which they intend to use as a front for a series of burglaries. Echo, disguised as a little old lady, poses as the proprietor, while Hercules is her shop assistant. Tweedledee passes himself off as the old lady's infant grandson (apparently nobody ever notices that the "baby" has a full set of teeth!). Also assisting them is "Sweet Rosie O'Grady" (Mae Busch), a pickpocket who had formerly been in business with Echo when they were both working in the carnival.Although Lon Chaney was known for his spectacular horror films, in his day he made a lot of crime films as well, and "The Unholy Three" falls under that heading. Apart from the scenes in which he is disguised as the "sweet Little old lady", in which he is very convincing, in this film Chaney appears as a regular person, which was a relatively rare thing in his career.Presented by a superior cast of actors, "The Unholy Three" is certainly among the most unique crime dramas ever filmed. It definitely deserves an 8 out of ten. Incidentally, it is worth mentioning that this movie made such an impression at the time of its release that it was subsequently remade as a sound movie, with Lon Chaney and Harry Earles reprising their roles. In fact, the remake of "The Unholy Three" was the only "Talkie" that the great Lon Chaney ever made before he died, much too soon, at the age of only 47.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>They say silence is golden--and in the case of "The Unholy Three," the silent version is superior to the 1930 all-talking remake. I'm not sure if I can articulate in words why I prefer the silent "Unholy" to its remake--one aspect of the film I thought was much better in 1925 is the 2 romantic leads. Mae Busch and Matt Moore make for a more likable romantic duo.The story itself is fantastic--to say the least--I'm not sure if Tod Browning had much input to the scenario for this film, but it does seem to have some of the elements of the bizarre and fantastic that Browning is known for. And--as many astute film fans can tell you-- the limits of the bizarre and fantastic would really get stretched in 1931 by the release of 2 films titled "Dracula" and "Frankenstein" respectively.Getting back to "Unholy", we have Lon Chaney as the ringleader of a crooked trio consisting of the circus strongman, Hercules and--dare I say--a "midget" played by Harry Earles. Another advantage of this silent feature is the viewer doesn't have to spend much time trying to decipher the words coming out of Harry's mouth--although I will say, there were times when I missed the dialogue from Harry; i.e., the scene where the little guy threatens to put some lilies under Rosie's chin if she squealed.Overall, of all the Browning/Chaney collaborations I have seen, "Unholy" would rank at the top of my list.8.5 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gorilla Justice</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Murderous anomalies from the circus sideshow were "old hat" by the time director Tod Browning Helmed the infamous FREAKS picture in 1932, which almost single-handedly brought on 81 years of film censorship in America (and counting). In 1925, Browning put out this silent--THE UNHOLY THREE--in which one thing leads to another, potentially posing a very sticky wicket for what an Intertitle card here labels "the grim machinery of the law." Sure, you can modify an American snuff chamber with his and her electric chairs (complete with a "cry room" for the young children, as in the Rosenberg Case). But how the dickens do you construct a triple-hanging scaffold for a strong man, a ventriloquist, and a 20-inch midget? The former's neck strength and the latter's lack of weight probably would leave both dangling and thrashing about indefinitely, while the man in the middle's dummy would be screaming bloody murder! Many spectators would die laughing--just the opposite of the desired outcome! Browning solves this conundrum by having a gorilla kill the strongman and the midget (off-screen, of course). Since the voice thrower sings for the court, he gets off with a song.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For criminal purposes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lon Chaney known as the man of a thousand faces usually reserved those faces for some grotesque character or monster to which he brought his considerable acting talents to create sympathy. The Unholy Three is an unusual film because he's quite an ordinary man here, but he effects the disguise of an old woman for criminal purposes.Due to some light fingered activity at a carnival he was employed at Chaney, strong man Victor McLaglen, and midget Harry Earles find themselves unemployed. Chaney who is a ventriloquist decides that the three with their unique physical characteristics and talents can be used to create a nice criminal gang. Chaney in fact goes incognito in the guise of an old woman and Earles plays her grand baby. Personally I think he was way too big to be a toddler, but that's a little dramatic license that director Todd Browning was taking.Chaney also buys a pet shop and Mae Busch who was a carnival waif goes and lives with them. They also employ Matt Moore as a salesman who is totally clueless about Chaney's and Earles's real identity and what they really do.Things go wrong and a murder is committed on a job Chaney could not go along on. That sets the rest of the story in motion.Of course Chaney's guise as an old woman is an astounding success as were all the other characters he created. Yet all the makeup and special effects would be for naught had he not had the acting chops to make it real.Saying that and saying that because Chaney's virtuosity dominates the film. I thought the ending was truly a cop out. It dulls the impact of Chaney's artistry and it was quite a let down in a film I was ready to rate a notch or two higher.Still his legion of fans will be well satisfied with this silent version of The Unholy Three remade by MGM for sound, Chaney's one and only sound feature.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredible yet vastly entertaining story with fine performance from Chaney...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a tribute to Tod Browning that his THE UNHOLY THREE manages to have such holding power as you watch it. The story is strange and very unique. At the same time, there are so many implausible elements thrown into the mix that you must suspend disbelief in order to sit back and enjoy the excellent performances.While LON CHANEY is undoubtedly at his best as the old Granny who runs a bird shop for talking parrots, the attention is compulsively drawn to the evil dwarf (HARRY EARLES). Later on, he served as one of the Munchkins for THE WIZARD OF OZ, but here he's a grown man able to pose convincingly as a baby--a very conniving infant who instigates the robbery and murder of a wealthy store patron.Since Echo (LON CHANEY's ventriloquist name), throws his voice whenever the parrots talk, the ventriloquism device is used for effect in the climactic courtroom scene where Chaney decides to help an innocent man wrongly accused of the murder. It's here that Chaney gets a chance to show us (in reaction shots) the great actor he was simply by using various facial expressions. Even though the device of throwing his voice at a trial is completely beyond belief, he manages to convince the viewer that such a thing was entirely possible.Chaney is very effective as the smiling Granny, Earles is scary as the psychopathic dwarf posing as a baby between puffs on a cigar, and MAE BUSCH is effective as the woman Chaney loves.Although slowly paced, it's well worth watching, drawing the viewer from the start with its strange and incredible story, an entertaining triumph for all concerned. It's been years since I saw the later sound version from 1930, but I believe this has a slight edge over the other.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lon Chaney at his Heartbroken Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Say what you will about the plot or with music or not, I enjoyed the hell outta this thing (Without music), and just Loved Lon Chaney in it. He was such a shady-lookin' character, with such an ugly, creased, fascinating face. One that had both light and darkness in it. And the man could act. It's not hard to see why he was the top box-office draw at one time. Also, I gotta give a shout out to big man Victor McLaglen, future Gypo Nolan from John Ford's "The Informer". Here he's not as drunk or beefed-out yet, but he's lean and mean and does just fine.And Super-Props to the biggest little man Harry Earles, future avenged cuckold in "Freaks" (Awesome!) and yes, one of those damned annoying munchkins from Oz. But here, he's one dastardly little fake-baby criminal. In his first scene, what he does to the kid in the crowd? So Bad. And smoking a cigar and talking' some smack from his high-chair, like he was imitating Pacino from "Scarface"? Even Better. (Special Request for the Cinema- Gods: More midget characters like this in movies, please.) But far and away the Best is still Lon Chaney, as Professor Echo, the Ventriloquist. Performing in a silent movie as somebody who "throws his voice" for a living, he carries the crazy plot, lights up the screen, and just does such an amazing job.My favorite thing in the movie is toward the very end. When the girl comes back to him at the sideshow because he's fulfilled his end of the bargain, but then he does the decent thing and lets her go back to the man she loves, and she's walked away after he's said goodbye through his dummy, and she's turned and waved and left, there's a moment where Chaney rests the dummy's head on his shoulder and "they both" sigh and watch her walk away. The look on his face... It's just so sad and beautiful. One of the greatest images in film ever.Thank You, Lon Chaney, wherever you are.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"That's all there is to life friends, a little laughter... a little tear"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was definitely a career highlight for Lon Chaney. It showed why he was a master of disguise and also why he was so beloved by the movie going public - no matter how bad the character was, he always kept a little humanity in his heart. With direction by Todd Browning and based on a novel by Tod Robbins (his story "Spurs" was turned into the film "Freaks"), "The Unholy Three" was an evocative and macabre thriller.Professor Echo (Lon Chaney) is a circus ventriloquist, who is in league with strongman Hercules (Victor McLaglen) and an evil midget Tweedledee(a sensational Harry Earles). They call themselves "The Unholy Three" and together with Rosie (Mae Busch) they work a pickpocketing sideline. But Echo has plans - in the disguise of sweet Granny O'Grady, he opens a pet shop full of talking parrots - strangely enough, once they are bought the parrots stop talking!!! This is Echo's big scheme - when Granny is called to the various homes to find out what is wrong with the birds, Tweedledee, disguised as a child, "Little Willie" cases the place and within a few days the house has been robbed and the police are baffled.John Arlington has bought a parrot and invites Granny O'Grady to his house to see if she can coax the bird to talk. At Arlington's home, Tweedledee is dazzled by some priceless jewelry and when, later that night Echo is waylaid into trimming a Christmas tree - Tweedledee, who is the real evil mastermind, convinces Hercules to do the job with him alone. They do but kill Arlington and leave a small child close to death - Echo shows by his reaction - "You....Filth", that he is not like the other two, that deep down he has feelings. The police close in - but the person they arrest is Hector (Matt Moore). He is completely innocent and has been hired to front the shop and be a "fall guy" in case the worst happens. Rosie and Hector, though, have fallen in love and she will do whatever it takes to free him - even sharing a loveless life with Echo.The plot is quite complex - there is even a giant monkey (actually a cleverly enlarged chimpanzee) that Echo keeps in a room, just in case the others "get out of line". The courtroom scene is a marvellous display of the emotions and expressions that Lon Chaney can create. He slips into court and because Hector only knows him as Granny, he doesn't recognise him. Echo then sends him a note with instructions - if Hector will go back on the stand then Echo will do the rest. There is a scene that shows Chaney's face displaying a myriad of emotions, from apprehension, fear, happiness and finally relief.Aside from Lon Chaney's acting brilliance, Harry Earles is a revelation as the depraved Tweedledee. A couple of his scenes were quite shocking. His introduction, at the beginning of the film as a carnival attraction shows his character in a few seconds. During a scene in which people taunt and make fun of him, he kicks a small child in the face and then has to be restrained. When he and Hercules come back from the robbery "gone wrong" - he is laughing as he recalls how the victims begged for mercy. Harry Earles found the role of a lifetime in "Tweedledee" the crazed and evil midget. It was quite extraordinary how he could convincingly switch from being an angry, cigar smoking crook to a little baby playing with his toys. In one nail biting scene when the police come to question them, the jewels are hastily put into a toy elephant and of course it is the toy the policeman picks up and starts to tinker with. Mae Busch is also very good as Rosie - she may not have the flapper prettiness of Lila Lee, who played Rosie in the 1930 remake, but she makes Rosie real.Apart from the "gaffe" of outdoor scenery being obviously a painted backdrop (when Echo and Rosie are talking in the woods, their shadows show) a few of the indoor scenes seem to be painted sets - it just adds to the illusion, mystery and moodiness of the film.Highly, Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Unholy Three</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Underrated Tod Browning production has Lon Chaney bringing his arsenal of facial expressions, putting his expressive talents on display yet again. When you often see the team of director Browning and actor Lon Chaney, fireworks happen on screen. Yes, the low budget for 1925 shows. There's a scene between Chaney's ventriloquist Echo and his pickpocket partner Rosie(Mae Busch, who I thought was quite good)supposedly on the outside discussing the fate of a someone set-up for which you can tell is a painted background on a sound stage, or the scenes with the supposed giant primate..but, if one gets into the dastardly story-line then this might drive them away from such trivial matters. Chaney stars as a ventriloquist working the carny scene whose "associate" Rosie picks the pockets of the wealthy supplying them with the extra refinements their true professions do not provide. He concocts a scheme, gaining the partnership of a strongman(John Ford veteran Victor McLaglen)and his pint-sized dwarf friend Tweedledee(Harry Earles, most know him from Browning's controversial film "Freaks"), to thieve the rich by pretending to be a family operating a store. They hire trustworthy, naive "boob" Hector(Matt Moore)as a fall guy if their schemes to swindle run across possible trouble. Rosie is to work Hector over, pretending to fancy him. Things get complicated as Rosie falls in love with her mark as a jealous Echo tries to nip their growing bond in the bud. Meanwhile, Hercules, the strongman, and Tweedledee decide to rob a client who recently purchased a parrot..in the film Echo is so good at voices, he can persuade possible shoppers to purchase parrots he provided the dialogue to..under the disguise of an elderly lady, Mrs. Granny O'Grady as Tweedledee pretends to be a little child..and kill the millionaire putting a damper on the future plans of The Unholy Three. The unholy union was anything but a solid foundation to begin with, but is certainly fractured when Hector is set up by the group for stealing jewels from the dead millionaire, framed for his murder, as Rosie threatens to expose them.There's just something marvelous about seeing Chaney disguised as a Granny and Earles smoking a fat cigar dressed in a child's clothes. There's a great scene where a detective is asking "Mrs. O'Grady" some questions as Tweedledee places the stolen jewels inside an elephant toy..you know exactly what the detective will eyeball when he sees it on the floor with Chaney's Echo on the verge of having a breakdown. The trial at the end is a bit far-fetched(particularly when Echo tries to put words in Hector's mouth while he's on the witness stand!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great? No, but it still held my interest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a bizarre little film and it's no wonder, as it was directed by Tod Browning and starred Lon Chaney, Sr.--a potent combination that led to many other strange and scary films. Chaney plays a ventriloquist who leads a gang of thieves. The others are a midget and a strong man (though Victor McLaglen doesn't look quite muscular enough for the role). The three leave the traveling sideshow they work for and use disguises to set up robberies. In a VERY interesting bit of casting, Chaney is dressed up as an old lady during most of the film! This is highly reminiscent of the excellent later MGM film THE DEVIL DOLL--where Lionel Barrymore does the same to avoid suspicion. Also, the midget is so small and young-looking, that he poses as Chaney's grandson--a baby! Believe it or not, they actually look pretty convincing in these roles.Later in the film, two of the three thieves stage a robbery AND kill the rich guy whose safe they robbed--and leaving his young daughter badly injured. When the police start investigating, they decide to divert suspicion by planting the stolen necklace on a poor sap! And, while Chaney was NOT one of these robbers or the murderer, he reluctantly agrees to help his girlfriend, Mae Busch, exonerate the man accused since she has fallen for the accused man. Now Chaney's plan to help the accused is really pretty hair-brained and was a low-point in the film. He uses his ventriloquism in a lame attempt to help out, but no one is particularly impressed (no surprise there). So, he finally admits what he knows and admits that he knows who committed the crime. Now, oddly and completely out of the blue, Chaney's pet gorilla(!) escapes at this same time and kills the other two crooks. Considering they deserved to die for their crimes, this seemed awfully convenient. And, despite a history of crime, the court agrees to just forgive Chaney and everyone is set for a happy, if not exactly believable, ending.While the film has many excellent scenes, some interesting plot elements and some great cross-dressing scenes, the film has a lot of hokey holes--not enough to ruin the film, but enough to lessen its impact.FYI--Originally, the film also featured a horrible scene where the murder victim's child was also murdered by the midget. It was apparently VERY disturbing, so the scene was removed and the title cards indicate she was only injured.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great with music, but without music?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this film at the same time as a previous commentator, Rikard Karlsson, did, that is at the Umea Filmfestival in September. Together with the newly composed 90's electric music that the orchestra performed The Unholy Three was a truly great once in a life time experience of moving pictures and sound! There probably aren't many more silent films better suited for musical experimentation and artistic expression. The audience at the Filmfestival was very impressed judging from their ovation.But, and here's a question. Would the film have been such a great experience without the music? Looking back at it I agree that some of the acting was indeed great, especially that by Echo and the baby-man. Without them and their sometimes incredibly funny performance this film would not have made the strong impression that it did. But the other actors didn't play in the same league. The pick pocket woman's story of tragic love is a little touching, but only a little and the giant strong man only seemed to be there as part of the freak-show gallery of characters. He didn't add anything to the story. And the film story as a whole isn't much to brag about in my opinion. It builds up to something great but then the end comes disturbingly abruptly. What was that scene with the monkey? Funny, yes - but out of line!So what was it that made the film so great? The actual film or the music? Of course both, but I believe it would have been a much less exciting film without the music. I hope there will be more performances of silent movies the way it was in Umea; that was a great way of bringing an old 20's silent movie with to new life and adding new dimensions to it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unholy Three, The (1925) ** 1/2 (out of 4)A Tod Browning film about a ventriloquist (Lon Chaney), a strongman (Victor McLaglen) and a midget (Harry Earles of Freaks fame) who join forces after leaving the sideshow to become "The Unholy Three". The ventriloquist masquerades as an elderly woman while the midget hides as a baby so the three can steal jewels from the rich. I'm somewhat cheating by including this here but it doesn't contain a few horror elements as well as one of the most suspenseful and brilliantly carried out scenes from the era. Chaney is very good in both his roles but it's Earles who steals the show as the maniac midget. Browning adds a touch of weirdness to the film and we see a brief introduction to the circus world years before Freaks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tod Browning warms up for his Freak show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How strange it was to see Tod Browning's name in the opening credits, and then to have the movie start in the freak show of a circus, where all the main characters work. And freakiest of all was to see little Harry Earles, the luckless sap from FREAKS, playing a wicked baby impersonator! I wonder whether Browning already had his creepy 1932 feature in mind in 1925, or whether working on this film started the ball rolling.It's hard to think that anyone could have thought this plot plausible, but the relationships between the characters are handled well. The friction between them, and their constant conniving, is just as real as in many more elaborate talkie crime pictures. The use of ventriloquism as a plot device is strained to the max, but it's still fun watching Lon Chaney in a dress.The music score which was dubbed onto THE UNHOLY THREE in the TCM version was a hodge-podge of various eras and instrumental combinations. It became so distracting that I ended up watching the film in complete silence. But that's just me. Some nice camera and lighting work (the use of shadows, particularly) added a touch of class. And a final question: does anybody besides me think that the judge in the courtroom scene looks like Bill Nighy?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sunday July 16, 5:00pm The Castro, San Francisco"That's all there is to life, friends ? a little laughter . . . a little tear . . . "Between 1919 to 1929, Tod Browning and Lon Chaney produced ten films. The most visceral performance of the bunch can be found in Chaney's character, Alonzo the Armless from The Unknown (1927). As a cleverly conceived, perfectly executed, well paced story, fraught with tense moments and frightening circumstances, their third film, The Unholy Three (1925) is the one that made the franchise. Three carnival sideshow performers devise an ingenious front for their burglary ring. The leader, Professor Echo, the ventriloquist (Chaney), masquerades as 'Granny O'Grady' (That is one ugly old lady!), the owner of a bird shop. The carnival dwarf, Tweedledee (Harry Earles) poses as 'Little Willie', O'Grady's infant grandson, a maniacal, cigar smoking, bloodthirsty fiend dressed in baby cloths. The strongman Hercules (Victor McLaglen), a brainless brute is their obvious muscle. In their carnival scam, Rosie (Mae Busch) picks the pockets of unsuspecting onlookers and splits the loot with Echo. She comes along as O'Grady's granddaughter to run the store with Hector (Matt Moore), their clueless clerk. Rich customers buy birds never knowing Echo is actually speaking "Good morning auntie. Pretty Polly. Pretty lady!" When they call to complain, 'Granny' with 'Willie' in a pram go to investigate and case the home of their next victim. When Hercules and Tweedledee pull a job on their own and commit murder, Echo is outraged and spends the rest of the story repairing their damage.Echo is another example of the character Chaney most often played in Browning's films, a sympathetic man who shows his evil side, only to find some degree of redemption in the end. The climactic scene of The Unholy Three is the tense and suspenseful summit of the Browning/Chaney pairing. An investigating detective questions the trio in their cozy livingroom decorated for Christmas while the evidence is hidden in the baby's toy, "Cow! Cow!" Later, Browning employs effective camera trickery to make one ordinary element terrifying. The Unholy Three was also the only film Chaney ever re-made, as his first and only 'talkie', a testament to the films enduring popularity. The delightfully evil Earles, who went on to become a singing munchkin in The Wizard of Oz (1939) also appeared in the updated version.</fullReview>

Prof. Echo, a ventriloquist, throws his voice to make the purchasers believe the parrots are great talkers. When they complain that their birds are not talking any more he visits them at their homes with a baby in a pram ("Tweedledum" the midget) and checks what they have to steal. Luckily rich people seem to spend their time openly admiring their gems with the safe open.And that's the plot in a nutshell. A very dull film indeed.
