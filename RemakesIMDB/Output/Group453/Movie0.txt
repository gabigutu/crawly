		<fullReview>Went to this movie without much expectation, but as always best things happens at the place and moment we least expect. This is one of the best movies in contemporary of tamil film industry (Kollywood) and signature movie for the director (A.R.Murugadoss). This is a best movie to study for screenplay and dialogue, casting vijayakanth in an absolutely stunning role utilising his experience and screen presence.All in all this movie reflects the current issues of contemporary India and what is the difference that young students can make in this society. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Didn't have a lot of expectations from the movie as it was captain's movie ..but boy!!this movie turned out to be one amongst the best...superb story with a very professional screenplay and not to forget captain's acting...he suited perfectly for this role... the movie can be easily ignored by anyone because of the cast but if you do so then u r missing a great show. the movie has got some of the finest actors with lots of talent and experience. the climax was heart touching and surely worth a few tears. this movie was a revelation then and still can be one for the future...very few songs but still really good ones...this goes right in my movies archive!!</fullReview>
