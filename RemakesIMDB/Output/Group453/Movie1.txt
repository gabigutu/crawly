		<shortDescription>Anti Corruption Force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the better films against Corruption, though sometimes appears like a documentary, contains some of the best scenes to hit the Indian screen in recent times.The best part is the Corrruption is shown in Hospitals, with the Indian PDS, Police force, PWD dept. Real Estate promoters etc and the climax (Court scene) is great quoting Rabindra Nath Tagore's Geethanjali. Also the scene where Chiru reels of the vital stats of AP state is very well shot - "Our AP State government (1998 - 2003) through the Central govt has taken a loan of Rs.57,000 Crs from the World bank imposing a burden Rs.7500 on every citizen of Andhra Pradesh". Kidnapping the 15 most corrupt officers and eliminating the most corrupt one and equating it to a running race where the one who comes first will be shot dead is a novel way of presenting the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie features Megastar Chiranjeevi in a never before seen way. He looked extremely glamorous and I am out of words to comment on his dances. The least word I can use to talk about his performance is "Excellent". The movie is basically a one man show by Chiranjeevi who forms a team with his students to eradicate corruption in Andhra Pradesh, India. Looks like Chiranjeevi is planning to enter politics.So watch out, dont miss this one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some Indian movies which need you to know history of the star's growth to appreciate. This is indeed not one of them, and credit should go to Chiru for making it largely refreshing without carrying his weight too much in (like Kamalahasan does these days).Having said that - it is a pity that serious movies cant stay consistently so in Telugu. Glamour, songs and street fights are still required to keep the Telugu Tempo for a movie where the hero is a rebel trying to change the society with his radical ways? Or is it that only some key industry people think so?Why can't a guy of Chiranjeevi's stature, take small risks with movies like this, and make it sound an authentic rebel movie? If he can't who else can? Why is it that such seriousness can only be possible in Kannada or Malayalam, why Telugu soul is being sold for commerical interests so much?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One man show!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>only one man could have done this role. Chiranjeevi fits in like a hand in a glove into this role. After the immensely successful Indra, the expectations were sky high. The young director V. V. Vinayak, chosen after his immensely successful Aadi and Dil, proves himself to be one of the finest talents on the block. Manisharma delivers a good score, not as good as Indra but again, the dancing megastar can elevate any tune to heights. the story is of a man fighting corruption using his students as his weapons, seen earlier in umpteen number of films. It is definitely the direction and screenplay that make this one truly different. The hospital episode is definitely the best to hit the screen in a long time. The only flaw was that the movie turned too talk heavy at times with little entertainment value, it could have done better with some comedy and a little less dialogs. Overall, a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The power of intelligentia.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not a fan of Chiru earlier. My friends who were already fans were saying that the movie was excellent, but i thought that they were saying it only out of their adoration. I went to watch the movie without any biased mind. After two days, I was adoring Chiru more than my fan friends. Though "Anti Corruption" was already dealt in Bharateeyudu and Oke Okkadu, Vinayak's treatment and Chiru's high levels of maturity in action made it feel entirely different. Also the earlier movies were dubbed versions and missed nativity. Moreover the roles of heroes in those movies were just ordinary men. But "ACF" is an intelligentia. Really, Hats Off to Tagore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Regular Chiru pot-boiler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We have seen movie with Anti-Corruption themes earlier (Bharateeyudu, Gentleman, Oke Okady etc). This movie is on similar lines however with a different weapon - youth power. For a hardcore Chiru fan, I am sure that this movie would be an emotionally satisfying experience.The movie does manage to address a few burning issues of the country. However the hospital track could have been more astute sans humour.Romantic track hampers the pace of the movie with unnecessary songs.The comedy is good - Sunil should try over-exposing himself lest he might end up like Bramhanandam, Ali, Kota &amp; Rajendra Prasad.K Vishwanath, Jyothika and Ramaprabha are wasted in a minuscule role.The "pelli chuppullu" track could have been easily done away with (c'mon guys lets face it - Chiru is not that young anymore!).Prakash Raj abstains from being loud this time around. Sayaji Shinde impresses in his role which has shades of Shool (and noteworthy to mention that he mouths his own dialogues in Telugu). The last time I watched Chiranjeevi's movie was about 10-years ago. I must prophesies confidently that 5-years down the line, we would be watching a standard Chiru flick comprising an opening solo song, an average storyline, two younger heroines with four songs equally divided amongst, Chiru wearing bright shirts and trousers in all the songs and of course one-man action sequences.It is clearly evident that Chiranjeevi is imprisoned in his aura of mega-star. Age is catching up and he should begin his transition to move into roles that suit his age. It would ideal if he could learn a lesson or two from his contemporary Kamal Hassan about experimenting with various roles - and there is no dearth of unconventional themes. He has already reached a pinnacle and his fan-following will not diminish regardless.</fullReview>
