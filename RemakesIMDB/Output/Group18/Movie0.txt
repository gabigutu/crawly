		<shortDescription>Nowehere near as good as the original, but worth a viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A remake of John Carpenter's superior film of the same title from 1976, Assault on Precinct 13 concerns a siege on a largely abandoned police station, which is related to the presence of a notorious criminal, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne). It's left up to a ragtag group of police employees and criminals to defend themselves.I should start by noting that I absolutely love Carpenter's original film. In my view it is one of his best, perfectly capturing the suburban desolation of 1970s Los Angeles, and exquisitely suspenseful and horrifying, even though it's not really a horror film. Despite that, when this remake of Assault on Precinct 13 began, I had high hopes for it. The first scene is well directed, well shot, with excellent dialogue. It turns into an intense action scene at just the right moment, and results in some realistic, gritty deaths. The opening is as good as anything in the Carpenter film.Unfortunately, Assault on Precinct 13's excellence ended right there. It's not exactly a bad film--I enjoyed it more often than not, but it does have more than its share of flaws. In the end, my rating average out to a 7 out of 10. Recommendable, but with reservations.The first problem is that director Jean-Francois Richet tries to do too much--too much backstory, too many characters, too many over-the-top characters, too many quick cuts, too much shaky hand-held camera work, too many "big action moves", too many explosions, too many settings, and it's too dark. That the film is often so quickly edited and dark makes it too often difficult to see what's going on in the action scenes. Carpenter's film succeeded by being very taut, economical, sober and logical in its directorial style. Richet tries to one-up the original by forgoing all of those qualities. By the second or third scene, I was fairly confused. Superfluous characters were popping in and out, people were mumbling dialogue, and there was a whole complex backstory being hinted at and not spelled out very well.The brutal shooting near the beginning of the original film, which sets off the whole sequence of events, was dropped--that thread was completely removed from the film. It was lamentable in that this new Assault loses much of the simple, sensible drive the thread provided, and it was surely a decision based on political correctness. Likewise, Bishop is not allowed to be a clear-cut bad guy here. That saps some of the effectiveness out of his cooperation. In this film, he might be mostly tough talk. The other criminals in the film are either left largely unexplained or guilty of only petty or consensual crimes. I find this kind of political correctness in films reprehensible, although I realize it's primarily a studio decision.On the positive side, the villains here were cleverly conceived, and their nature makes them much more menacing physically. On the negative side, however, Richet lost the Night of the Living Dead (1968) zombie-like nature of the marauders, which saps suspense from the attacks. The logistics of the defense of the police station and details of their dilemma are not very clearly scripted or staged, either, which doesn't help. Another flaw is that some intruders seem to inexplicably hesitate. Another positive, though, is that Richet's film brings back a few small details, such as the capture of the criminal at the beginning of the film, and a substance addiction in one of the heroes leading to a character transformation, found in Rio Bravo (1959), the film that in conjunction with Night of the Living Dead, was the main inspiration for Carpenter's original film.Also on the positive side, this Assault has a skilled (and much more well known) cast. Even though Richter occasionally directed them to be a bit too over-the-top, the performances hit many very interesting notes. And a few of the additions to the original film, such as a Mexican standoff and a couple later scenes outside the police station were excellent. The increased firepower here may also be to some viewer's liking.A viewer less fond of the original, or even unfamiliar with the original, may like Assault better than I did. I may have even liked it better if the original were not so fresh in my memory (I just watched it again it recently--a review is forthcoming). There are enough redeeming aspects for action fans to make it worth at least a rental or a viewing on cable, but approach the film with lowered expectations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic but Enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a snowy New Year's Eve, a police station where a bus full of convicts has been jailed comes under attack from corrupt policemen, forcing a police sergeant with a cloudy past (Ethan Hawke) to team with a ruthless mob boss (Lawrence Fishburne) to try to keep them at bay.The original was a pretty good film so I'm still confused about the need to remake it. Yes, it was a little outdated but the film still worked fine. I was expecting the remake to be really bad since the trailer looked lackluster and Ethan Hawke isn't that good of an actor. However, this update turned out to be a decent film. It doesn't approach the original in quality but at least it doesn't insult the original either. They do change some things from the original though that didn't really bother me. Actually, it's kind of better that they tried it in a different way instead of doing it exactly the same (paging Psycho) and there was more reason to remake it.The performances were okay, nothing special. Ethan Hawke was okay as Roenick. He would sometimes go over the top and he was a little weak at some points. Laurence Fishburne was better than Ethan but still only average. Ja Rule actually gives a good performance for a rapper though he doesn't get a lot of screen time. John Leguizamo was okay, kind of dull. Maria Bello gave the best performance out of everyone and she is a pretty underrated actress. Gabriel Byrne was just meh while Drea de Matteo was clearly there for eye candy and nothing more.Jean-François Richet does a decent job at directing and he manages to create some suspense. However, he does keep the film simple and most of the twists are obvious. The script is generic and weak with a lot of clichés and little in the way of originality. The action sequences are slick and enjoyable but they are also kind of sparse. The movie also becomes dull from time to time even though the film isn't really that long. There is also little character development so it's hard to feel sorry for some of these people. The remake is really just a semi-enjoyable, generic action film. It fails to surpass the original in most categories but it still stands as a decent film. In the end, Assault on Precinct 13 is a decent action film and it's worth checking out. Rating 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A good cast and one terrifically exciting action sequence keep afloat an otherwise average film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rating: ** 1/2 out of **** A lot of people will likely hate this movie by virtue of the fact that it's a remake. Being open-minded, I'm not offended by the thought of a beloved cult classic getting a Hollywood remake; it is, after all, quite interesting to see how the big-budget treatment affects the same premise. In this case, the result is not too shabby at all, certainly better than the ads would indicate, even if this is a remake that doesn't stand on its own nearly as well as Zack Snyder's Dawn of the Dead.Assault on Precinct 13 (referred to as AP13 from here on out) stars Ethan Hawke as cop Jake Roenick, a former undercover officer who's now strictly on desk duty after a horrible mishap that resulted in the deaths of two fellow officers. It's his last day (coincidentally also New Year's Eve) in Precinct 13, and he's simply overseeing the transfer along with another cop (Brian Dennehy) and a secretary (Drea de Matteo).Due to the snowy conditions, a prison bus transferring dangerous cop-killer Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is forced to take refuge in Precinct 13. But it becomes clear soon enough that there are a large number of corrupt cops surrounding the precinct, determined to kill Bishop and every possible witness inside. Faced with no other options, Roenick frees and arms the prisoners, using whatever means necessary to battle against the far more numerous and better armed enemy.John Carpenter's 1976 cult hit was a fairly effective thriller, maintaining an atmospheric claustrophobia that balanced nicely with the well-choreographed shootouts. Though there are many differences between these versions, both plot-wise and stylistically, this remake essentially opts for the same brand of edge-of-the-seat excitement, but as is par for this generation's offerings, the action sequences are pumped up with a lot more firepower and a lot less plausibility.As silly as Carpenter's film may have seemed to the discriminating viewer, it was a smartly plotted thriller with only a few minor holes. This remake, on the other hand, is riddled with all sorts of logical inconsistencies. The most obvious one? In less than a day, the head of the corrupt team of cops (played by Gabriel Byrne) is somehow able to assemble his men on very short notice and arm them with top-notch weaponry that must have been hell to sign out from the armory (he even calls in a chopper at one point). And as the body count significantly rises, one has to wonder how he plans to cover up the massive blood shed (blaming it on Bishop's men doesn't quite explain how his own men were killed or what they were doing at the precinct).The body count is almost bafflingly low considering the numbers mentioned (Byrne says he's got 33 men, hard to believe corruption could spread to every one of them); I could swear fewer characters were killed than were even involved in the entire film. Other problems include a scene where Byrne chooses to execute a survivor rather than use this person as a bargaining chip, and as the number of survivors within the station dwindles down, one character conveniently remembers an escape route just as the building's about to be invaded. The climax, a disappointingly rote cat-and-mouse chase, is set in a forest apparently right by the station, but I could have sworn an overhead shot established the precinct in an entirely urban section of Detroit. Along with the sagging pace in the second half, predictability also hampers the suspense, it's too easy to figure out who's going to die and in what order. The identity of the traitor is also another easy guess, considering the very tiny list of suspects still around by that point. For all these nagging flaws, the film is still worth mildly recommending for one lengthy, high-octane action setpiece. The first major invasion of the precinct is a thrilling sequence, every bit the equal of the similar siege in the original, though louder and faster-paced. The action even boasts a little bit of strategy and some mild thought. Other action scenes are competently handled, but lack the claustrophobic edge of the shootouts set within the precinct.The cast is mostly first-rate, even Ethan Hawke, who usually does little more than coast by on his best Tom Cruise impersonation. Laurence Fishburne, channeling a darker version of Morpheus, does well with what little material he has to work with, and it's fun to see Brian Dennehy barking up a storm again. Of the two female leads, Maria Bello is the one with more "depth," but she's almost fatally annoying as the whiny psychologist. Drea de Matteo, on the other hand, is one of those rare women who somehow still looks sexy even when she's dressed as a hooker (or is she sexy because she's dressed that way?). Gabriel Byrne makes a solid impression despite the limited screen time, and Ja Rule and John Leguizamo are apparently only on hand to provide some truly lame comic relief and take equal turns participating in one very gruesome beating.AP13 came very close to getting a two-star rating from me, but in this day and age when action films need sci-fi, fantasy or horror elements to succeed, there's no denying this film is better than the usual lot churned from Hollywood. This remake is an earnest attempt in crafting an edge-of-the-seat thriller and even if it only gets halfway there, that's still better than most pure action movies these days.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An exciting, violent action film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, before you criticize me, I have never seen the original John Carpenter version of this film. Being a huge fan, I really should see it, and after seeing this remake, I will definitely track down the original to see if it is as good as this film. I had a blast! New Years in Detroit, a cold winter's morning as Precinct 13 prepares to close it's doors and move to a new building. There are only three people in the building on New Year's Eve, and as a storm draws closer, a criminal being transported to a maximum security center is re-routed to the deserted precinct. Only, there are some other people that would like to get closer to the villain.Very exciting story and excellent acting by both Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishbourne take this action over the edge. Some people may find the film ultra violent, but violence on the big screen never bothered me, so I enjoyed it quite a lot! Definitely worth a look for action fans, and fans of the original who are curious. However, those that are disturbed by violent images, would like to steer clear of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did not think I was going to like this remake of the 1976 cult favorite. I was, however, pleasantly surprised. The movie was fun. The characters were likable. The action was well paced. The sets and backgrounds were excellent, giving the viewer a feeling of desolation and dread that the original movie had in abundance. I originally heard that Ethan Hawke's character was the same as his character in "Training Day", but I totally disagree. Oddly enough, both characters were named Jake. So, they were both young police officers named Jake who were going through a rough period, but Ethan Hawke played both differently. This is not a movie to bring your kids to; too much violence. This might be a good date movie, but not a first date movie. All in all, I give "Assault on Precinct 13" (2005) an A-. If you want to have fun, watch it. - JFLY</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why remake the original "Assault"? To my mind "Assault" was Carpenter's true masterpiece. It had all the elements good Carpenter movies contain. External threat on a small group of individuals. People taking the challenge because they are forced to do so. Isolation! Just remember, the guns in Carpenter's original made no sound, being thus a lot more threatening than conventional devices. And now this remake. Concentrating on "main character I"s psychology and on his relation to main character II (the evil but honorable). The anonymous threat in the Carpenter movie replaced by a rather conventional conspiracy/corruption background. The "remakers" just didn't understand the main plot of the original. And thus produced something pretty ordinary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of a remake and yet still packs a punch. I've seen the original "Rio Bravo" several times, including when it first came out. It was masterfully done and was one of the Duke's best movies from the 1950's. I saw John Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" when it first came out in 1976 and remember it as being one of Carpenter's best movies. Now we have another version with basically the same characters including the drunk, originally played by Dean Martin, who is tested by the struggle for survival and eventually passes with flying colors. When I first heard the Christmas music in the movie, it took me a moment to grasp the reason for the Dean Martin selection until I realized it was the producer's way of paying homage to the crooner's performance in "Rio Bravo." This would be more entertaining for those who have not seen the originals. This remake follows the originals to the point of spoiling some of the surprises intended. I won't go into detail on this since it would then spoil the surprises for those who have not seen the originals. The story is there; the action is there; and the entertainment is there, especially for those who are seeing it for the first time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sloppy, boring remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't have much hope for this when I when went to Copenhagen to see this remake of the '76 film, which isn't a masterpiece itself, but highly entertaining and one of Carpenter's best. So when I came out of the theater, I wasn't that disappointed. It was as bad as I thought it would be. Hollywoodized for the average viewer's enjoyment. Quick cuts and flashy shots. It doesn't take its time to tell the story.One of the problems is the clichés. I almost laughed when Jasper (Brian Dennehy) said "I'm retiring in two days", or something of the sort. You just know that he'll be dead before the credits roll. Also, even the biggest retard in the audience can figure out halfway through the movie that he's a bad guy.Another thing is that the situation is not believable. In the original "Assault" it was crazed gang members that was attacking the station, but now it's 33 top trained S.W.A.T. members. No way can 8 people hold them off. But I guess it's the corrupt cop's (played by a very dull Gabriel Byrne) own damn fault; First he sends three S.W.A:T.'s in to take care of business, and when they get killed off, what does he do then? He sends in three more! If he would just send in all their guys at once, Ethan Hawke and co. would be dead and buried 45 minutes into the film and I wouldn't have missed my train home. And that brings me to the likable characters. There aren't any. When Beck, a paranoid junkie who won't shut up, is the most likable of the bunch, you know it's bad. For instance, there's the annoying, playboy pin-up psychologist. Or the convict who refers to himself in the third person (how totally funny). Laurence Fishburne does what he can with this, but I'm getting tired of him.And Ja Rule does an extremely poor job. Why do people keep hiring rappers/singers in movies? They don't make good actors, with few exceptions like Meat Loaf's Bob in Fight Club and Björk's Selma in Dancer in the Dark.This remake doesn't have the charm or watch-ability as the original "Assault" has, and Lars doesn't like that.3/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a movie about Precinct 13. An assault on it ensues.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Keeping watch over a rundown Police Precinct on an icy New Year's Eve night sure sounds simple enough. What could possibly go wrong? Welp, check your Action Movie Clichés Dictionary and you'll find the answer. Problems arise when a van transporting Laurence Fishburne and other hardened criminals to the city jail finds itself unable to traverse Detroit's icy streets. What are the viable options? I'll give you a clue - there is only one ... DING DING DING ... Take up residence at the nearby Precinct 13 for the night.OK, no big deal. The night might not be as quiet as hoped for, but how hard can it be to baby-sit this group of punks? There's John Lequizamo as the drugged out Puerto Rican. Then there's Ja Rule as the "gangsta" who refers to himself in the 3rd person. And then there's some chick who is cursed to forever be recognized as "the black, manly-looking chick who guest-starred on (fill in name of cop/forensics show)." Oh, wait. Then there's Laurence Fishburne. The only intimidating guy in the bunch. He could be a big problem because he's one of the most notorious mobsters/gangsters in town.As expected, Fishburne does indeed become the key to everything. It doesn't take long for a few masked invaders to storm the Precinct. They want Fishburne. The cops originally assume that it's Fishburne's men trying to help him escape, but we all know that's not the case. Rogue cops haven't been invoked yet, and rogue cops always make an appearance in an action film like this, so who's after Fishburne? ROGUE COPS! You see, they've had some dirty dealings with Fishburne, and they fear their corruption might be exposed if he talks. They have no choice but to eliminate him. I'm sure it was a big moral dilemma for them, but a choice had to be made.This is where the fun begins. Because he and his men are badly outnumbered, Roenick decides to arm the four prisoners. That's cute and all, but what happens if the siege is diverted? Roenick tells the prisoners they'll remain under arrest, and they'll "figure it all out later," but I'm thinking a group of armed thugs will take exception to that, especially after helping cops survive an attack by other cops.Oh well, what can you do? It's at this point that the bullets and the clichés start raining down on us harder that Ike Turner's fists on an ex-wife. You're not gonna walk out of this movie soused with originality, but who cares? This is just solid, action movie fun. You'll ooh, you'll ahh, you'll grimace, and you'll make fun of the cheese. Allow me to share some of my favorite ridicule-worthy clichés from the movie: * Rogue cops magically block everybody's cell phone signals. We're not really given a reasonable explanation. I guess the director thought they needed to answer the "why can't they use their cell phones to call for help" question but neglected to realize people might wander how the signals were blocked. It's called movie magic.* Professional snipers apparently can't hit the broadside of Rosie O'Donnell's monolithic buttocks from a few feet away. Oh, they hit all around their targets; they just can't hit the actual target. My favorite example is when a couple of the prisoners are outside hiding behind a snow bank. The sniper can see the prisoners behind the snow, but he responds with, "I don't have a shot." THEY'RE BEHIND SNOW! When, in the history of the world, has soft, fluffy snow ever stopped a bullet? * Bad guys "monologue-ing" instead of shooting. Why do bad guys insist on giving long speeches before killing their adversary? The speech is always juuuuuuust long enough to allow the adversary to escape the desperate situation he faces. Do movie bad guys not watch movies? You'd think they'd learn.* A completely unsurprising plot "twist." Stevie Wonder called; he said he saw it coming a few miles away.But again, who cares? If you can buy the 5'9" 150 lb Ethan Hawke as a tough guy cop, then everything else should be easy to swallow.One thing that I appreciated, a facet that will probably be lost on the average soccer mom, is the movie's "show no mercy" attitude in regard to who gets killed and how. In movie land, the rules clearly state that all innocent people should survive, all actors who are somewhat recognizable should survive, and no animals are to be harmed. Clearly, Assault on Precinct 13 wasn't made aware of these rules. I warn you now, don't get too attached to any particular character. Everybody is fair game for a graphic bullet to the head. And if you're squeamish when it comes to violence towards animals, well, keep in mind that a dog actually gets punched in the face.I just wish there had been a better lead actor for me to cheer for. Hawke is serviceable as the head cop, but I've just never been a huge fan. The fact that Fishburne could obviously snap him over his knee, and I would have had no problem with that, doesn't help. I think the biggest thing hurting Hawke is that records confirm that the name on his birth certificate is NOT "Tom Cruise." Someone needs to alert him of this fact and tell him to drop the impersonation.THE GIST Assault on Precinct 13 is an action movie for the Grand Theft Auto video game crowd. It's loud, it's fast-paced, it's profane, and it's in your face. It doesn't pretend to aspire to be great art. The goal is to entertain, and the goal is achieved. If you're squeamish with violence, or if you're looking for intellectual enlightenment, then I recommend looking elsewhere.Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)</fullReview>

Hawke shows up in uniform with something on his face. What is it?? Five o'clock shadow? A goatee?? I spent more time trying to figure this out than paying attention to the movie. No self respecting police officer would show up in uniform like that or allow another to do so. He looks like some kid who walked in off the street.Stylishly shot and a great cast, but its failure to be anchored in something close to reality turns it into an unintentional spoof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on your brain - Beyond DUMB</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film I've seen since Charlie's Angels 2. The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with. SPOILERS ............................................................. I know they've said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch Rio Bravo? Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic, the premise of the film was that the sheriff (John Wayne) had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang. No one wants to liberate anyone in Assault on Precinct 13. They want EVERYONE dead. So, my first question would have to be, WHY NOT JUST BURN THE WHOLE PLACE DOWN FROM THE START? Why "assault" the place at all? I know the contrived plot turn was suppose to be clever and shocking but it didn't make sense and/or was presented properly. If the veteran cop was in on it from the start, why the need for this whole movie? If the veteran cop suddenly cut a deal at the back door during the siege, how did he even get the chance? As soon as he appeared at the door he would've been shot and they would've had their entry point. It's all just FUBAR. What part of any city can an all out war take place at a police precinct (complete with helicopters and massive explosions) but no one notices?? However, as soon as there's a fire they have to "leave before the fire department shows up"?????? How did they plan to cover up the chaos that was happening outside?? Police issue bullets in the walls, bullet casings, footprints, equipment usage, and the fact that there were going to be no bodies of "Bishop's men" to be found? How about those police snipers? How could they possibly miss so badly so often? I like the fact that when the two detainees tried to run, the snipers were foiled by two tiny mounds of snow. As if it's not possible to shoot a high powered riffle through a pile of snow. The set up was interesting although ridiculous but the movie just went off a cliff when they decided to kill that particular character with a bullet to the head for absolutely NO REASON at all. I know the makers of the film were going for shock but all they got was disgust at the cruelty and the anger of the audience. Don't you think that part of the reason why this thing is bombing at the box office is the fact that word of mouth has everyone telling friends and family to stay away from this one? That particular scene has to be a big part of that word of mouth (that and the fact that every plot turn is dumber then dirt). The conclusion remains steadily stupid as the villain pauses to deliver an Austin Powers-like diatribe instead of killing the helpless people who he has finally captured. I know several people have mentioned the closing scenes that take place in the woods of Detroit city (&gt;snicker&lt;) but why did Ethan's character just wander off in to the woods in the first place? He doesn't even look to see if the SUV with the secretary and his friend gets away? They just cut to him prowling slowly in the woods, pistol in hand. GACK. I could go on but won't. All I can say is that you want to avoid this stupidity at all cost.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Intense, wild, well-acted thriller - just a tad absurd</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean Richet's remake of the Carpenter thriller Assault on Precinct 13 is surprisingly entertaining. Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) loses the Carpenteresque weirdness and soundtrack, and tells the story of a remote, run-down police precinct under assault using more conventional cinematography and production. This is an achievement, but not because of the difficulty of following in the footsteps of Carpenter - because the film entertains without doing so, and because the narrative - just like all of Carpenter's films- manages to keep going without regard for the improbability of the plot. In other words, the Director kept a straight face and made the film entertaining enough to allow for a certain amount of suspended disbelief.Strong, fast, characterization - part of the legacy of Carpenter's film - makes a big difference early on. The cast is uniformly excellent and the main characters - unusual for this genre - are all unique, believable and consistent. Fishburn plays a big bad guy incarcerated by fiat in the small, run-down Precinct 13. Hawke is the Sergeant in charge of the precinct - a man with psychological and drug problems associated with a traumatic event which opens the film. These two improbable allies must pool their resources to defend the precinct against... who? The film is first and foremost an action film. The action is typical for the genre as of 2005 - i.e. - much of what takes place is only believable because of its entertainment value and internal consistently. Suspense is well constructed throughout the film, and the pace of the film reaches a frenetic level about 1/3rd of the way through, never letting up. The cinematography is surprisingly dissimilar to the original. Richet's film is more of a standard suspense thriller than anything bearing Carpenter's signature.Recommended for its entertainment value, solid cast, and well-constructed (though somewhat ridiculous) plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic, uninspired interpretation of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's 1976 original was a little cheesy and low-budget looking at times, but it was still a very well done film. It was short and to the point. Carpenter knew how to build psychological tension and his vision of a street gang attacking a police station was menacing. The original Precinct 13 also offered social commentary. It was made at a time when Americans were fleeing the inner city due to a proliferation of gang violence the police seemed powerless to control. The original Precinct 13 registered with the American public in much the same way as the Death Wish and Dirty Harry films.The trouble with the updated 2005 version is it has nothing to say. It's very much a generic Hollywood thriller/action flick. The big-name cast all turn in mediocre performances, trying their best to work with the mundane script and direction. The psychotic street gang has been replaced with crooked cops. The crooked cop aspect is supposed to be an unexpected plot "twist", but it's been done to death and elicited a bored *sigh* from me. Most of the original's psychological tension has been replaced with endless dialog that never seems to go anywhere. In the 1976 version the street gang is mostly seen as faceless shadows in the dark of night. They seem to kill purely for fun, almost like something out of a horror movie. We don't truly understand their motivations, which makes them far more frightening. The updated version gives us way too much information about the crooked cops and they become not nearly as threatening. Overall, there's a strong feeling of "seen that before" when watching the 2005 version. There's nothing special or unique going on. This isn't a terrible movie, but it doesn't offer any new ideas. It's a classic example of Hollywood playing it safe and winding up with a middle of the road film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I felt this film was very much a missed opportunity. The plot, of a small group in a building being menaced by killers, is a staple of movies, even taking into account Rio Bravo, from which the original Assault film borrowed. Done well, with enough suspense and plot twists, such a story makes a decent, credible movie.The problem is, this picture comes across as a primer of How Not To make a successful thriller. Not one of the characters, up to and including Ethan Hawke's pill-popping sergeant and Laurence Fishburne's overly literate gangster, is anything other than stereotypical. Dialogue is cliché ridden, often needless, and devoid of humour. There's little tension, just repetitious action, explosions, violence. The producers don't seem to realise that each major character needs their own mini-story to make them interesting to the viewer, and there's very little personality clash apart from the most obvious. Some of it is just not believable even on its own terms: for instance, a professional counsellor would right away put a stop to any flirting on the part of a patient, assuming it to be manipulative behaviour. In keeping with the film's somewhat prepubertal attitudes, there's no romance or sexual tension among the characters ? indeed, we're not even sure who the female love interest is.All of which makes for a rather uninvolving couple of hours, unless you are the kind of viewer who loves stories packed with grenades, guns with red-dot sights, car crashes, smashing windows, bullet stricken foreheads, unexplained helicopters, noise etc ? video game movies in fact. Others may feel that, in a good film, in order for such things to be effective they need to be kept to the barest minimum in favour of such low-tech fripperies as character development or suspense. Trouble is the former type of viewer is increasingly becoming the only type of viewer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake, but no competition for Carpenter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they first announced there was a remake of John Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" in progress, my immediate reactions were a little something like: "What?...Why?... This is blasphemy! ... This movie doesn't need to be remade!... etc etc" John Carpenter's original definitely was a revolutionary cult film. It was shocking, disturbing and politically incorrect and they simply can't make movies like that anymore nowadays, no matter how cliché that sounds. Therefore it was impossible for this remake by Jean-François Richet (never heard of him) to improve over the 1976-version. The good news, however, is that Richet never really tries to steal Carpenter's thunder and he surely delivered the best possible movie he could. Assault '05 is an A-budgeted movie that often has the charm of a B-movie and hangs together by adorable clichés, stereotypes and very explicit violence. On new years eve 2004, moments before the transfer towards a brand new police precinct, the old and abandoned precinct 13 is besieged by a gang of heavily armed and well-trained police officers. The reason? Top-gangster Marion Bishop, who was arrested earlier that night, has too much knowledge regarding the corrupt cop Marcus Duvall and his unit. In order to save their own careers, they have to eliminate Bishop before dawn, but also the innocent cops and random people who're in the precinct, because they know too much too now. The film offers quite a lot of suspense, good acting performances (by an impressive cast) and hard-boiled action. The setting (Chicago during a severe blizzard) adds to the tension. John Carpenter's original (which was, in fact, already a sort of remake of "Rio Bravo") will always remain one of the coolest, groundbreaking action movies ever (if it were only for that brutal and hugely controversial ice cream-truck sequence alone), but this film is a neat tribute.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke may never be recognized as a great young actor by the vast majority of moviegoers but in my opinion he hasn't made a serious flop in his career so far.The rest of the cast did equally well if not better at times. A special praise goes to Laurence Fishburne who gave the best performance in the movie.Overall the film has enough to offer to be considered worthy of a second view but it still lacks a few factors that could boost it further from the mass of similar movies. ...... 3/5 ......</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the worst movies I have ever seen. I have a hard time imagining that any of the major actors read the script before accepting their roles. Both Hawk &amp; Fishburne are capable of so much more, have their careers really sunk so low that they have to make this kind of garbage? The characters were such one-dimensional clichés, it's no wonder that the only attempt at character development was a gratuitous shoot out at the beginning which had nothing to do with the rest of the film The story was unbelievable. Scrambled cell phone signals? Calling in helicopter support without anyone else in the department noticing? A forest magically appearing in the middle of inner city Detroit? It's pretty insulting that the producers thought so little of their audience's intellect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's original is a fondly remembered cult classic .. It's maybe not as good as you remember it to be . You disagree ? Welll watch it again and tell me if you think it contains any superb acting because many of the performances are painfully wooden . That said for a very low budget thriller that delivers the thrills it has few equals . It also contains one of the most memorable soundtracks of cinema so you can understand why when news leaked that it was going to be remade the feedback was very lukewarm and its performance at the box office had a very poor showing On its own merits it's an okay crime thriller , nothing more nothing less . Certainly the budget is patently much more than the original and much of it has been spent on screen and we see several well known actors . The film does try to develop the characters a bit more than in the original but wisely not too much since it's an action thriller and character back stories that look like they were scripted by Dostoyevsky are not needed . . This makes the opening hook featuring Jack Roenick redundant but I guess being an action thriller action is required along with showing the audience that this isn't going to be a scene for scene remake This is the problem with Jean Francois Richet's remake however and that is when the film goes its own way it's inferior to the original and leads to a massive plot hole in the premise - a bunch of corrupt cops try to eliminate captured fugitive Marion Bishop because he knows too much . If you give it any type of intelligent thought it all collapses quickly . How do these cops manage to sign out weaponry like assault rifles and stun grenades without anyone in charge and not on the take asking awkward questions ? Perhaps most importantly of all wouldn't there be easier ways to kill Bishop such as signing the custody order to a corrupt cop who then could shoot him and claim he tried to escape . The original might have also had plot holes but it stayed true to its own logic . The remake doesn't</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing action film with an awesome cast , thrills and lots of violence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The picture deals with an assassin (Laurence Fishburne) along with a group of delinquents (J.A Rule , John Leguizamo) are led to prison by security policemen (Kim Coates and Dorian Harewood) and during a snowstorm find shelter in a sleepy police station and almost locked out due to demolition . Precinct is commanded by a sergeant (Ethan Hawke) and there are an old police (Brian Dennehy) , a secretary (Drea De Matteo) and a psychologist (Maria Bello). Police station in ghetto district 13 is suddenly under siege and itself surrounded by violent gangmen heavily super-armed with technological weapons and helicopter . The opponents attackers sworn revenge about the murderer now inside the precinct 13 . Film captures the special excitement or mood of paranoia that those under siege live for the night . Psychosis abounds when the policeman and prisoners are attacked from all sides and can see no way out making desperate tryings to flee . Film has maximum tension , noisy action , emotion and thriller from the subsequents attempts by the violent stalkers to enter in the station and the besieged to survive or getaway for prevention of the seemingly inevitable final . From the initiation of the movie to the end action-packed and suspense is unstopped . A very exciting storyline by James De Monaco though much-copied and superb casting make this one of the best thrillers made in that year . The picture is an adaptation of the semi-acclaimed John Carpenter film with the same title what also was a rendition of Howard Hawks's ¨Rio Bravo¨ and the remakes the ¨Dorado¨ and ¨Rio Lobo¨ ,that were developed in a besieged jail defended by a tough John Wayne and helped by a misfit bunch . Flick will appeal to action movies lovers . Rating : Above average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a pleasant "Assault" but still watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story has appeared many times over the decades in increasingly violent and less stylistic forms. John Wayne was in two, the more famous of which was "Rio Bravo" (1959). A seasoned veteran has to command a few loose cannons in order to fend off an invasion. John Carpenter made the stylish and violent "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) before his landmark horror "Halloween" (1978). Now we've arrived at this 2005 remake.Directed by Jean-Francois Richet, Ethan Hawke is the pill-popping alcoholic Jake Roenick who must round up his troops on the last day at Precinct 13 on New Year's Eve in Detroit. When a group of prisoners, including Bishop (Laurence Fishburne, in Morpheus mode) make a stop-over at Precinct 13 because of a highway accident, thugs in ski masks lay siege to it trying to get Bishop. Thinking fast, Roenick gathers up everyone, including cops and prisoners, to fend off a vicious attack.This doesn't quite live up to its predecessors in a lot of ways. It lacks true suspense and often treads the line between cool and cliché way too often. A number of plot-twists are made too, but do little to lend any weight to satisfaction. No Oscar-worthy performers, though John Leguizamo does a nice turn as a hot-headed junkie.6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Take your pick. All accurately describe this waste of a film. I'll never get these 2 hours of my life back. No movie should ever make you feel that way. This one does.It tries SO HARD to be cool, hip, trendy. In reality it's none of these. It's tired. It's old. It's unintentionally funny. It's moronic in every sense. It's dumbed-down to the lowest possible common denominator of the human species.Can't come up with a witty line? Throw in a few profanities to liven up the script. Can't come up with a scene that will hold an audience's attention for more than 30 seconds? Shoot another person in the head or jab another person in the face with a pointy object -- and I'm a person who uses the "F word" on a daily basis and I like some good violence in a movie. But not in this one.Laurence Fishburne shows his versatility again -- this time by playing a quiet, subtle guy who you aren't quite sure about and who likes to use looks instead of words to make his point. Oh...wait. I kept waiting for him to look at Ethan Hawke and say: "Stop trying to hit me and HIT ME!"And can anyone tell me what the point of Drea de Matteo's character "Iris Ferry" is? I can't, you can't, and neither can the director.Don't waste your money on this garbage. If I could give it 0/10 I would.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yet Another Dumb Action Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>PLOT: 6/25: Sgt. Jake Roenick (Hawke) used to be a narcotics officer, but after an incident where he lost his entire team, he has stuck to a desk job at Precinct 13, a run-down police station. It is New Year's Eve, and he is closing down with old beat cop Jasper O'Shea (Dennehy) and slutty secretary Iris Ferry (de Matteo). After a surprise visit from Roenick's psychiatrist Alex Sabian (Bello), they start to celebrate when they get word that a prison bus carrying four prisoners must spend the night due to the poor weather. The prisoners are fast-talking junkie Beck (Leguizamo), softly spoken Smiley (Ja Rule), who refers to himself in third person, innocent-claiming Anna (Hinds) and, finally, crime lord Marion Bishop (Fishburne). After a while, Sabian is forced to retreat back to Precinct 13 after her car breaks down in the weather. After a while, they find that Precinct 13 is surrounded by dirty cops, led by Marcus Duvall (Byrne), who intend to kill Bishop before he can spill the beans on their operation. Now the cops and the prisoners must work together to get out of this mess alive.Sure, it's a fine start, but this movie is just plain stupid. There is absolutely no way in hell these prisoners could ever stand a chance of surviving. These are cops equipped with 9mm pistols and whatever else they could get together against battle-trained SWAT commandos with high-tech assault rifles and flash grenades. It really makes no sense how these commandos could ever suffer any significant amount of casualties.It also makes no sense how they could get these assault rifles that look like they are still ten years from being released, but can't use something as simple as a grenade to flush the people out.There are more plot holes and stupidities, but I do not wish to spoil the movie.The whole thing about a cop station under siege and prisoners working with cops is a cool scenario, but this never rises above stupid action movie here.ACTION: 13/25: It's a B-movie, so expect B-movie action. We get a nice dose of gore and the action is pretty reminiscent of Die Hard in the style it is presented in. It never does get the old blood pumping as well as it should though.The whole stupidity factor plays in here again. It is tougher to enjoy action scenes when you constantly are thinking "These commandos are retarded." The scenes aren't terrible, but they are often repetitive, and when they aren't they are can feel fairly retarded. So they are sometimes pleasing eye candy, but are never memorable in any way, shape or form.ACTING: 14/25: The cast here looks pretty good when you see the poster. Like most movies with all-star casts, however, it doesn't click in some aspects.Ethan Hawke (Training Day) is wooden, and we never really have much depth into his character. That is partly the script's fault, as we learn everything about him in five minutes. Fishburne (The Matrix) is given the necessary role as the kingpin in prison, which he pulls off, but doesn't seem to try to do anything better than the minimum with. Leguizamo (Ice Age) is good as the comic relief drug addict, as is Maria Bello (The Cooler), even if both are somewhat annoying at times. Dennehy (Rambo) is just there to yell, and Drea de Matteo ("The Sopranos") is simply there to show us her hooker-esquire stockings.The acting is nothing special, but when you think about it, how much did you really expect? ENTERTAINMENT: 11/25: If you really have nothing to do, I probably wouldn't discourage you from seeing this. I would definitely not recommend it though. It's stupid and unmemorable. The kiss of death of modern action movies.TOTAL: 44%: Assault on Precinct 13 is just like any other stupid action movie with too many special effects, just with less special effects. It feels like a B-movie, looks like a B-movie, is acted like a B-movie. There is no real good qualities to it. I do not recommend Assault on Precinct 13 for these reasons. If you really have nothing better to do, make sure to switch your brain off before viewing this movie.</fullReview>

The writing was blasé, the acting was blasé (although Laurence Fishborne was by far the least offensive), the directing was horrid ... it just wasn't done real well. The action was fine but nothing stupendous. A solid "C" if there was one ... and I have to say Ethan Hawke and Drea de Matteo really bit it with their quasi-acting in this movie - although I will have to say that I'm not sold that it was all the actor's fault, as a great deal of the wasted effort was definitely in the writing.A solid rental.

		<shortDescription>Assault on Logic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one remake that we really didn't need. The original, as dated as it is, could be considered the movie that made John Carpenter's career. The original, made in 1976, is not a bad movie, if you surrender yourself to Carpenter's synthesizer stylings and a plot line that defies logic. A gang of bad guys leads an assault on a police precinct, turning the whole precinct into a war zone for one night. The main problem with doing a remake of this story is that it was a difficult concept to believe in 1976, and there have been quite a few technological advances in the last thirty years. Unless they were going to do this as a period piece, it's just not the kind of story that you can do in the age of high-speed internet, PDAs, cell phones and laptop computers.The filmmakers' solution to this was to have the whole thing take place on New Year's Eve and also to build into the plot the fact that the cops in the doomed precinct are getting ready to move to a new precinct. If that sounds like flimsy logic to you, raise your hand. So what we are treated to in the first 10 minutes of the movie are a lot of really painful scenes of exposition where characters say things like, "Seeing as how it's New Year's Eve, and I've shut down all the computers and the phone lines are down, we might as well get drunk!"The set-up is difficult to believe, and it's almost as if the actors all know it. It's really painful to watch actors like Gabriel Byrne, Lawrence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke and John Leguiziamo struggling through this ridiculous garbage. If you can survive this Assualt on Logic, and you can suspend your disbelief in spite of overwhelming odds, you'll get to see the bad guys attack the precinct. From there, it's one long, continuous shoot-out. It is, of course, interspersed with scenes where we find out that some of the cops in the precinct are not entirely good, and some of the criminals are not entirely bad. What's most amazing is that EVERYONE in the movie gets shot right between the eyes. I'm not even kidding. Every single character gets shot right in the forehead, whether it's by close range or by sniper rifle. Admittedly, I don't know too much about shooting people, but it seems like the odds of everyone getting shot right between the eyes are a bit of a longshot. Ah well, it gave the director plenty of opportunity to show actors staring off into space with a tiny red hole in their forehead. Maybe the director was trying to make a statement.On the whole, the production values are good and the cinematography isn't bad. It's just a completely ridiculous scenario, badly executed with dialog that would get cut from the worst soap opera. The actors, talented as most of them are, seem to know that they've signed on to be in a turkey, so they turn in performances that feel stale and uninspired. In the end, you just have to wonder if we really needed a remake of this movie, especially when it turned out to be so much worse than the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For the first five minutes or so this movie looks pretty good. A drug deal is going down, and then it goes bad when somebody makes the dealer as a cop! Ethan Hawke is totally believable as a drugged up scumbag -- it's when he has to play a heroic cop that the movie falls apart.Many moons later . . .The worst actors in history come together to play an assortment of loser cops and loser criminals holed up in a condemned precinct house being attacked by mindless bad guys. The story is dumb, the script is clumsy, and the special effects are bad. Not even the snow looks real!All this has a tragic effect on Our Heroic Actors. They seem to know that this is a career-killing movie. Their shoulders slump. Their eyes glaze over. Their acting gets worse and worse as they sink into a zombie state. And some of them used to be talented too! Let's meet the doomed cast of ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13: ETHAN HAWKE. Generic pretty boy, Frankie Avalon type, adequate in light romantic comedies. The usual leftist affectations off-screen. Wretchedly miscast as a tough cop. Keeps limping around to remind us he was once shot in the line of duty. Really wanted to see him get slapped around by Laurence Fishburne or Brian Dennehy. Or even by Drea De Matteo! LAURENCE FISHBURNE. Effortlessly authentic. Genuinely talented. Seems to know the movie is bad, but holds his own as the villain just by keeping quiet and allowing his own personal power to overcome the absurd script. It would take ten Ethan Hawkes to make one man like Mr. Fishburne. He can't save the movie, but he won't let it drag him down.JOHN LEGUIZAMO. Brilliant Latino actor. Also senses disaster. Tries desperately to rave and shriek and chew scenery, hoping for redemption. Sabotaged by moronic dialog. "Us colored people should unite! Take guns and kill the oppressor. But first I need drugs. Lots of drugs!" Offensive and insulting Latino stereotypes soon reduce him to crawling through snow, begging for a bullet in the brain.JA RULE. Moderately famous rapper. Snoop Dogg without charisma. Tries to act, forced to mumble third-person asides instead. "Smiley don't like this. Smiley don't want to be here. Why Smiley talk to hisself?" Ice Cube and Snoop Dogg are Olivier and Gielgud compared to this guy.MARIA BELLO. Lovely blonde actress. Genuinely alluring in Mel Gibson's PAYBACK. Played a bitter call girl who'd seen it all, and was utterly mesmerizing and believable. No more. Here she's a "psychiatrist" who dresses like a hooker and behaves like a nine-year old. "They're shooting! Oh my God! Guns! We'll all be killed. Help me!" DREA DE MATTEO. Christopher's girlfriend in THE SOPRANOS. Apparently it's easy to look talented when you have the best scripts, best dialogue coaches, best supporting cast, and best hair and nails money can buy. Here, as a lady cop, well, it's not fair to expect as much. Her dialog veers between "Ooh, I wish I could stop thinking about SEX" to "I want a cigarette SO BAD!" The best actress on earth couldn't have made this work. BRIAN DENNEHY. Thirty years after FIRST BLOOD, still playing Sheriff Teasle. 'Nuff said.GABRIEL BYRNE. Classy Irish actor. Doesn't want to be here. "We've got to kill them all before sunrise. It doesn't matter if they're cops like us. It's the only way. (SIGH) Why do I feel so empty inside?" If you can watch this movie as a comedy, it's really good. But if you are expecting a story with real action where things make sense, don't bother.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's original "Assault on Precinct 13" was a film that should have been left alone. This remake, directed by Jean Francois Richet, is not without its merits, but in the end, it leaves us wishing it was better.We are given the situation that four prisoners, one of them a powerful drug dealer, are being taken from a court building to a holding facility. Because of the bad weather, it's decided, at the last minute, to have these guys taken to the old Precinct 13, which is closing.What appears to be a simple job of locking up these bad guys, turn out to be one of the most violent situations seen in movies in 2005. At first, we are led to believe the black SUVs following the transport bus are people that are trying to free Marion Bishop, the powerful criminal that doesn't want to be in jail. We keep thinking it makes sense, until we realize, these people that are trying to storm the precinct, want Bishop, because he is a dangerous man who will testify in court against them. These people are higher ups in the Detroit's police department.The film is highly entertaining and will keep anyone involved following all what's being seen. The violence is too much to watch, at times. Ultimately, Roenick, the young police sergeant, emerges as the one that deals a heavy blow to the people that are trying to kill him.Ethan Hawke does good work with his take of Roenick. Equally effective, Laurence Fishburne, who plays the bad guy, Marion Bishop. Gabriel Byrne, Maria Bello, Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Drea DeMatteo, and the rest of the cast make a valuable contribution to the success of the movie.Fans of this film genre will probably compare this remake against the original one, and while this one is not as satisfying, it will not bore anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original "Assault on Precinct 13" is gritty, witty, and - perhaps most importantly - short. This remake is mercilessly padded out and talky. Worse yet, the African-American hero of the first movie is here replaced with handsome white boy Ethan Hawke, which makes this "Assault" less progressive than the 1970s one. God, how I miss John Carpenter and his improbable plot line and his weird sense of humor. I even miss his B-list actors, who are leagues better than Hawke and company.I can't say I care for the new villains in this version - they stretch what little credibility the story ever had to the limit. The female characters are useless, the criminals are all generic hoods, and Gabriel Byrne gives another of his bored performances. The music's all wrong, too - it's bland action stuff that actually detracts from the tension. Simply awful.</fullReview>

Also, Mr Director, I get that you are really clever with your bullet effects. How many times did we see a zoomed in shot of a barrel or a car getting riddled with bullets? (sarcastic wow!) And your head shots with blood coming out were good too... the first 5 times anyway! Had to laugh at some of Jaspers acting too, who cast Brian Dennehy?

Something has to be done, it smells like "movie-oligopol". Thank God for Layer Cake this year (oops i guess that was a British production so maybe the Hollywood glory days are over).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was perhaps the worst movie I've seen in a long, long time. Forget that it's clear no research was done regarding Detroit (forest in downtown Detroit! Bwahaha!!). The writing was horrible, the premise completely implausible, and quite frankly, the characters were embarrassing. I cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful. Now, I have never seen the original and don't know if this movie pays tribute to it's original form. It's my understanding that the original was not set in Detroit. Why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent. Don't waste your time on this junk, unless you're from Detroit and wish for some comic relief.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, large studios continue to produce this kind of tripe and the only way that they can be convinced of the error of their ways is if people stop paying money to see these formulated masterpieces!

		<fullReview>Is it just me, or is this an AWFUL film? I'm going with it's an AWFUL film...Knowing full well that it's a guy flick (usually defined as full of car chases, crashes, gunfights, explosions, etc.), I still expect some small degree of credibility. If I can't somehow believe in the premise, the film WILL NOT WORK. Thus, we come to the problem with "Assault on Precinct 13."Not one for spoilers, I never report details of the plot. However, I will make an exception here, because the plot is SO inane. Bad guy is jailed in Precinct 13. Bad guy's buddies want to bust him out. Surprise. The bad guys' buddies are actually corrupt cops. Brooding, troubled, but heroic young cop saves the day while romancing the girl. UGH. Yes, it really is THAT simple, and that dumb."Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in Detroit. Not a bad setting for crime and corruption (I spent 3 months there in late 2004, so I know what I'm talking about). Even so, it's outrageously violent and insulting to the police and the citizens of Detroit. I have spent a lot of time in downtown Detroit, but I cannot imagine how the final chase wound up in the downtown Detroit forest. I must have missed it...There are NO refunds for watching bad movies. Save your money. There were too many good films in 2005 to waste even $3.00 at Blockbuster on this one.FINAL RATING: 1(Only because I have seen worse films.)</fullReview>

There isn't even anything humorous in the way this movie sucks. It's just a complete high budget failure.The plot and the characters are paper thin. Characters are briefly introduced: a drunk cop (anyone seen Die Hard?), retiring cop, cop killer gangster, horny secretary (whose tits they didn't even show)... The reason for the siege of the building is given in maybe two sentences. All the events in the movie are incredible. Snipers who miss an almost sitting duck on the open, a police station in middle of nowhere in a big city, nobody noticing the firing, the flames and the smoke. What about a guy firing his pistol and hitting the target while walking? I've tried that in the army and it doesn't go like that. And the snow is not real! Did I mention the action yet? It's boring. A man killed with an icicle! Maybe the director hadn't watched Die Hard 2...I pity anyone who payed even a dime to watch this. I pity the screenwriter, the producer, the director and the cast for making this movie. I wouldn't brag about it in my CV. I wonder if the original movie was any better.</fullReview>

Then laser beams started following everyone from the windows which were supposed to represent laser aiming devices on the bad guys guns I guess, but ended up looking like a cheap aerial searchlight show at the opening of yet another Curves for women.

		<shortDescription>One of the Worst!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake is one of the worst constructed and tasteless films I have ever seen. In my mind it is a big budget, but flat, and truly "D" movie made by a director with no understanding of the poetic construction of a film. One of the attractions of John Carpenter's films is the focus on the principle characters, while the antagonists are "phantoms"; undeveloped and mysterious entities, there for the execution of the plot and action. That concept is at the heart of the action and resolution of all his films.This director chose to bring the phantoms out into the light, and make them police officers, no less. He broke the spell of a tight-knit, diverse group, at odds with each other, cooperating to survive against virtual monsters. He also made the violence wrought upon these human characters of the film, so graphic and gratuitous that it pained me to watch it. Just because police officers have become corrupt, does not make them into the mindless, and thus expendable creatures of Carpenter's excellent films. The idea that so many police officers would be so corrupt so as to deliberately murder fellow officers, is patently ridiculous.There were so many unrelated psychoses in the plot, that the characters lost their distinct personalities in this predictable muddle. I found the resolution to the film so diffuse, and the sudden scene change so abrupt and confusing, that I was still wondering how they got there when it all ended; predictably.One must wonder how someone who has surely studied film in all its facets, can create such an ugly mistake. It took me two tries to make it through this mess. This film is certainly not going to become a classic. Watching it made me appreciate that low budget but sterling Carpenter Classic that I recommend any day over this inept drivel. Do yourself a favor. Avoid this one at all cost.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK, here is the deal. I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions. However, this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous. Let me get this straight. The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer (along with a number of other prisoners) on a bus with a grand total of two guards. They then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working, one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out. Apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct got the night off for new year's eve. Right. But wait, it gets better. Gabriel Byrne shows up to take out Fishburne before he can rat him and other dirty cops out. (although we never find out anything about their relationship or dealings). Interestingly, the cops launching the assault on the precinct are in full SWAT gear with night vision goggles, assault rifles, the whole nine yards. Later on they even bring in a helicopter with MORE people in full gear. I'm not a cop, but I'm pretty sure you can't just waltz out of the station with an entire swat platoon worth of equipment without someone asking what you are doing. And the police helicopter??? In the supposedly terrible winter storm??? Also, no one near the precinct happens to hear or see this major siege going on with flash grenades and heavy rifle fire going off? I mean seriously, come on. I know this is set in Detroit, but even there it would raise suspicion on a supposedly top secret mission. I also love the fact that they find a Tommy Gun in the evidence room and somehow the gun still works and has bullets that are still intact and usable.I could live with some of these problems if there weren't other glaring issues also. For one, the opening couple minutes of the movie are shot nicely in a very frenetic and hyperactive way and I thought was going to set the tone for the rest of the movie. Unfortunately I was wrong. The remainder of the film has no sense of pacing or tension or drama. The "characters" don't relate to each other in any way which is probably largely due to the fact that they aren't particularly interesting. There isn't enough interesting action to make this a good action movie, and there isn't enough character development/storytelling to make this a passable thriller/drama. The "relationship" between Hawke/Fishburn is the only thing that the director even tries to make interesting or intense. Oh and by the way, the final scene in the wilderness? Uh, I thought this was in the middle of a run down industrial section of Detroit and suddenly we are in the woods?? The acting isn't terrible in this movie, it is just that the directing and writing are atrocious. I really enjoy some of Hawkes, Fishburne, Byrne, Dennehy's other movies but this one is terrible.</fullReview>

Think King Kong (1976), but then there's King Kong (2005). The John Carpenter Original was no King Kong so there isn't as much to lose if one does not consider JC's worshiping Fanbase.But here it is. A violent, barely intelligent, Starry Movie that delivers on the most basic level. Entertain the targeted Audience. Done. Make it look "new" even though it is from an "old" Story (including Rio Bravo, but many others). Done. Have a Cast that is recognizable and fun to watch. Done (except maybe Ja-Rule, is there a less charismatic Rapper?).So overall this is an Entertaining no-thinker that requires a lock-down of critical concern and requires the minimum of consultation concerning Story holes and jarring juxtapositions. This isn't Brain Surgery, but does contain more than a few (Symbolic?) Deaths by way of Bullet to the Brain.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13, which is the remake of John Carpenter's 1976 version of the same name is an entertaining action film with credible performances, cool action scenes, a nice story, and just gives you a fun time. It's not going to win any awards, but this is how you make a "B" film. I haven't seen the original so I can't compare, but this movie stands well on it's own.This film is about a cop named Jake and a few others who are about to shut down their station for good on New Year's, but when a gang of violent prisoners including a guy named Bishop arrive, they are attacked by an outside gang and these prisoners and cops must gang up together in order to survive the night.The acting is nothing special, but it's nothing bad either. Each actor gives a solid, credible performance. Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne are two respected actors and I liked them in these roles often squaring off against each other.Overall, this is a solid action film. For a mid-January release, this movie is quite good. I don't know if fans of the original will like this, but action junkies will totally dig it. It's a good old-fashioned shoot-em-up. I rate this film 8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another remake where you should really just watch the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie reminds me of an argument I had with a guy over the NBA. He claimed that today's NBA players and teams are better than they ever were and that the original Dream Team couldn't compare to the Redeem Team that won gold at the recent Summer Olympics. I argued that today's players are bigger and faster and may have certain individual skill levels that are higher, they aren't as good as players used to be because they don't really know how to play the game. The remake of Assault on Precinct 13 is another example of something that can seem better while actually being worse.Only the basic core of the original remains in this film. It is still about a group of people trapped in a police precinct as bad guys lay siege to the building and try to kill them all. And there is a bus of prisoners that stops at the precinct and gets stuck there, with a particularly charismatic bad guy on board. Pretty much everything else is changed and while you can imagine how the filmmakers thought they were improving the story, what they came up with was pretty much worse than the original in every way.Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) is a cop who got the rest of his team killed when a drug bust went bad and he's ended up in charge of a police precinct about to close down, hiding away from responsibility in a haze of booze, drugs and self-pity. Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is a big time drug dealer who gets caught after killing a guy in self-defense in a church. He winds up on a bus of prisoners forced to stop at Precinct 13 for the night. Then the bad guys start shooting up the place and Roenick and Bishop have to work together to get the cops and the crooks trapped inside the precinct to work together to survive.If you just casually glance at the two Assault on Precinct 13's, you might be fooled into thinking the modern version is better. It's faster moving. It has a bigger budget. The plot and the characters seem more complex on the surface. The dialog is meant to be more realistic. And there's a lot more action in the remake. But this movie is actually inferior to the original in almost every respect.Firstly, this is both a stupid movie and a movie that thinks its audience is stupid. It asks you to believe that the bad buy snipers are both good enough to shoot people right between the eyes from a hundred yards away and bad enough to repeatedly miss easy targets like near-sighted Sleestaks. It never does anything without having a character stop and explain what's happening and what it's supposed to mean. Instead of letting the heavily armed and trained bad guys stage an all-out attack that would have ended the film in a couple of minutes, the bad guys only try and break into the precinct in ones or twos, like movie ninjas standing in line for the hero to karate chop them. It has a "twist" toward the end that makes absolutely no sense at all.This remake is also strikingly phony at every point where the original tried to ground itself in some sort of reality. The original tried to base itself on the societal decay and unleashed violence of the 1970s. The remake just slaps together a crooked cops storyline and doesn't even try to be relevant. The hero of the original is a normal guy who clings to his concepts of law and order even as things fall apart around him. The remake's hero is the same, generic, wise cracking doofus haunted by past tragedy we've seen a thousand times before. In the original, the bad guy who helps save the day ends up heading to death row anyway. In the remake, the hero lets the bad guy who helps him get away because, you never know, there might be a sequel.While very dumb, the remake of Assault of Precinct 13 isn't aggressively bad. It's just lifeless and artificial and contrived.Oh, and about that NBA discussion, when I brought up the idea that if the talent and skill level and competition in the league today is sooooo much better than it's ever been, that must mean the 2007-2008 Boston Celtics that won the title are the greatest team ever in NBA history.The other guy didn't want to admit that. But if today's players are better and today's teams are better and the Celtics still managed to put together one of the most dominant performances ever against that higher level of competition, then those Celtics must be better than the great Bulls, Celtics or Lakers teams of the past, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remodelling a classic noir: Superbly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ostensibly a remake of John Carpenter's cult favourite, the new and improved Assault on Precinct 13 acknowledges its debt to Rio Bravo early on with a couple of lazy Dean Martin Christmas jingles.Martin was a deputy drunk in Howard Hawks's 1959 western classic, which is where Carpenter borrowed the plot for his 1976 cop drama. Hatchet-faced tough guy John Wayne played a bossy sheriff in the original; in that film, Dino and Duke keep a passel of bad guys from breaking into jail and grabbing their prisoner.Same story here, except this time out we're in a condemned Detroit precinct on New Year's Eve, and the prisoner is a drug lord played by the lethally cool Laurence Fishburne.The film's real departure, and gamble, is that Ethan Hawke, dweeb aesthete from Before Sunrise and Before Sunset, is now playing the Duke's and Dino's cop characters. Hawke's Sergeant Jake Roenick is both drug addict and precinct boss. That's a lot of character acting for a perpetual juvenile 25 pounds shy of either Cagney or Lacey.Screenwriters Carpenter (he'll be redoing films at 100) and James DeMonaco wisely get us used to Ethan as a tear-away action adventurer in a ferocious pre-credit drug sting. Sgt. Jake throws himself around with nervous athleticism. Nevertheless, two fellow officers go down. And Jake catches one in the pin. Then, suddenly -- quick cut -- we resume action eight months later. Our limping hero is now a wisecracking junkie (Scotch and Seconal), trying to forget about A Time When He Cared.Making matters worse, the force shrink (Maria Bello) shows up New Year's Eve, wanting to know why Jake is still hiding behind a desk in a soon-to-be abandoned precinct. Everybody else is long gone, except for a party-girl secretary (Drea De Matteo) and an aging cop, "Old School" O'Shea (Brian Dennehy).Elsewhere, a mobster with a dangerous secret (Fishburne) is on his way to jail. Someone's trailing the van. Just as the expedition nears Jake's station, snow turns to ice and the cop car skids out of control. Driving is impossible. Detroit has been shut down. The van and its captives will have to hole up at Precinct 13 for the night.One of this enlightened B-movie's many pleasures is French director Jean-François Richet's handling of atmosphere and setting. Shot almost entirely at night in a blinding snowstorm, the crime drama is an intriguing remodelling of a classic film noir. It's a black and white movie by function of climate and time of day, with vivid stabs of colour -- a spreading stain of blood in the snow, Bello's flashing gold hair and Jake's frightened blue-green eyes.Richet also knows how to shoot action scenes. And his screenwriters scatter just enough bits of business and tough-guy patter around. Fishburne does a newspaper crossword puzzle for the first half of the film. And at one point a prisoner mocks a junkie inmate who, like Jake, is going through withdrawal by snarling that he's "sweating more than Mike Tyson at a spelling bee." Another plus -- the supporting cast has been shrewdly chosen. Ja Rule and John Leguizamo score as petty criminals locked up with Fishburne. Gabriel Byrne, who decorated the crime classics Miller's Crossing and The Usual Suspects, is walking the beat. And it's good to see Drea de Matteo working her eyebrows and hips again after getting bada-binged on The Sopranos.The film is not without fault. Hawke only holds his own as an action hero. And Maria Bello overplays a badly conceived character. Most of all, the film needs another player as potent as Fishburne.Still, Assault on Precinct 13 is a smartly assembled noir package. Canadians in particular might find it perversely satisfying to watch somebody else curse and fight their way through a deadly winter storm. Benjamin Miller, Filmbay Editor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>exciting actioner with numerous plot holes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of John Carpenter's film from 1976. Since I haven't seen the original, my short review relies on present standards. Assault on Precinct 13 is an exciting actioner with escalating tension. The main virtues of this flick are convincing, powerful acting from virtually everyone in the cast as well as the gallery of colourful characters. The movie is quite uncompromising as litres of blood are implemented and even positive characters are able to shoot in the head of villains without warning. Yes, this is that kind of film with lots of dead bodies and blood certainly not meant for everyone. Nevertheless, the pic is devoid of logic and that is a huge problem which directs this flick towards negative rating. The film contains numerous plot holes which are as big as those in a Swiss cheese. Why didn't assailants attack a van with prisoners, which would be so much easier? Why didn't characters use bullet-proof vests that were worn by killed attackers? How did the main heroine handle all remaining opponents at the end? I could go on and on like this. Thus, I advise you to switch off your brain center responsible for logical thinking. Otherwise, this film will occur ludicrous to you. However, Assault on Precinct 13 is a decent B-movie despite its visible drawback.</fullReview>

The performances by Hawke, Fishburne, Leguizamo, et al are worthy (though Gabriel Byrne becomes quite dull and uninteresting). BUT, all of the plot twists in this are much too predictable, which makes true suspense evaporate very quickly. Also, some flaws in staging and set elements are unforgivable. The suspense quickly blows away, much like the all-night snow that doesn't seem to accumulate more than 1 inch or so on hard road surfaces. The end is anticlimactic, dreary and boring.

Problem is that Brendan O'Byrne wants even more and Fishburne kills one of the collectors inside a church.Fishburne is soon captured but the snowstorm is so severe that driver Dorian Harewood, in a brief appearance, is forced to bring his police van to the precinct and stay there. Trouble is that the cops follow them and a shoot 'em up besieging of the precinct follows.Naturally, the other villains are armed by Hawke. We also have a police doctor and a secretary at the precinct all about to spend New Year's Eve there. The film begins 6 months before when Hawke's bad decision, during a drug-bust, leads to two fellow officers shot dead.Veteran cop, Dennehy, announces his retirement at the eve "gala." You really don't know if he is a good or corrupt cop.The film unfortunately is diminished by too much violence. Too many of those inside the precinct wind up being shot to death. It's one by one.In the midst of all this, we have John Leguizano,as a philosophy-like hood with a grand vocabulary to match. A totally unrealistic person for John L."Assault on Precinct 13" had a good idea gone bad by a bad script with some old clichés depicted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Note to Director and Producer: If you are trying to make a decent character-redemption action flick then cut Gabriel Byrne, Laurence Fishburne and John Leguizamo and replace them with extras. In that case, the rest of the actors were well cast in this Ethan Hawke vehicle that calls to mind his role in Training Day. But if you want to make this a three-way battle of wills then focus on Ethan, Laurence and Gabriel: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly. But every actor gets equal screen time and the all-star cast lacked the balance of Heat or Copland. Gabriel, Laurence and John outshone the others so badly it seemed like they were in a different movie and it detracted from the synergy the rest of the cast, including Ethan, showed.This unevenness was symptomatic throughout. Precinct 13 should have been edited down to PG-13 because the mood was never dark enough to support such graphic violence and language, at levels which belong in much heavier fare like The Usual Suspects or Apocalypse Now. Meanwhile, the Doctor and the Secretary try to ignite some sexual tension but it never catches fire because nobody quite gets the chance to develop chemistry. The Alamo-styled mismatch never makes sense because what would convince us this group of misfits could hold off the larger better-equipped force. This isn't Arnold in Commando or Bruce in Die Hard. Finally, the time factor never makes sense. They are trapped all night waiting for dawn but we never feel that crushing anxiety or claustrophobia like Night of the Living Dead or Aliens.Precinct 13 disappoints so often it is better not to bother. There are too many good movies-many listed above-dealing with the same themes better. The studio and director could never decide which themes to develop and ended up with an unrelated series of random clichés and wasted opportunities.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another pointless remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pointless remakes seem to be the order of the day. Right now it's mostly old and worn-out horror movies that turn into remakes, but there are also other "classics" that are being tainted by this fad. "Attack on precinct 13" is one of those, and as most other remakes it's completely pointless.It seems the creativity has completely disappeared from Hollywood. How else could i interpret these remakes and their complete lack of new ideas. Sure the concept here is not exactly the same as in the original movie, in fact the original movie's concept was better, but that aside this is the same crap we've seen already. "Attack on precinct 13" from 1976 was not a very good movie in my opinion, like most Carpenter-movies i think it lacked style and proper directing, but what it did have was a fresh idea. This movie also lacks style, proper directing and (also) decent action scenes - but most of all a fresh idea! If i would disregard that the fact that this movie is a remake it would still be poor. Ethan Hawke is a decent actor at his best, but the whole "jaded hard-ass cop" just doesn't work for him. He simply looks and acts too much like a sissy. Fishburne is usually not bad either but here he's degraded into some sort of lame Morpheus-ripoff. Gabriel Byrne on the other hand is completely wasted in a small and insignificant part. Everyone else is awful. But what bothered me more than the acting was the complete lack of suspense and decent action-scenes. Everybody fires guns constantly as though THAT would create good action scenes. The guns sound muffled and they seem to be loaded with blanks since despite hundreds of bullets fired nobody hits anything at all.Crappy story (worse than the original!), lame action-scenes, bad casting, poor directing... The reasons why this movie is a failure are many. This is just wrong on so many levels. It's time to stop with the remakes and start with the fresh thinking. Or, for gods sake: if you're going to do a remake then try to improve on the original! This is just weak. 3/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Copy of "Hard Rain"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't see the old version, but when i watched this one, it some how reminded me of a movie called "Hard Rain", to those who didn't watch it yet, i recommend Hard Rain more, although the story is different somehow, but you can see the similarity in the 2 main characters, Morgan Freeman as Laurence, Christian Slater as Ethan. also there was a similarity in the weather, tough rainy weather in Hard Rain,, hard snow storm. Now the ending is exactly the same, the gangster and the cop goes in their different ways, not to mention they don't end up shooting each other in the movie, because they had a truce, the same exactly you see in Hard Rain, they unite to fight the bad people, at the end, Morgan Freeman walks away and the Guard "Christian Slater" goes with his girlfriend who helped to fight with them.so technically, It's just another way of making Hard Rain.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Generic Assault on Generic characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 starts like a commercial, plays like a formula action flick, and ends in the key of clichés. The, ahem, commercial advertises the problems of our hero so his archetype character can complete his arc, but other than that serves no purpose plot-wise. Unfortunately, I really didn't care for the rhythm set up by the editing, nor the shaky hand-held camera-work throughout the ensuing chase sequence. So, I got off to a bad start with the film. The idea was nifty and worth experimenting with, I'll give it that, but I think it should ultimately have been left on the cutting room floor, finding an alternate, more provocative, means of communicating Jake's source of psychological distress.Fans of Carpenter know the premise comes not only from the original Assault, but that Carpenter himself ripped the premise from Howard Hawks. The fort (precinct) is under siege. The new film accounts for the updates in technology in an obligatory scene where all is rendered useless, taking us back to square one. Don't ya just love how advancements in technology get us nowhere in these films? The means of storming the Precinct has been updated for modern audiences, but everything else feels like carbon copies of the classical story/character templates. This is what bothers me.It's the age-old song and dance for characters, a loudmouth wanna-be juxtaposed to a cool and calm badass, paranoid disobedient subordinate juxtaposed to a reluctant hero, damsel in distress, and so on, and so forth. All this seems to yield the same tried-and-true internal confrontations, for example the irritatingly drawn out standoff sequence midway through the film which follows the standoff screenplay rules step by step (side note: once, just once, I'd like to see everyone die right then and there).The same tried-and-true suspicious moment comes precisely on schedule, leading all the characters on a hunt for the unnamed traitor that the audience naturally figures out on their own. Followed by the obligatory capture scene, followed by the obligatory escape scene, followed by the obligatory hunt for the main villain, followed by the obligatory tried and true final confrontation.To my relief, however, I found Gabriel Byrne rise above the material and breath life into one of the archetypes (despite how hard the film tried to treat him like another template). I found myself yearning for the film to return to his point of view, and not pigeon hole Byrne's performance into a mostly-off screen mastermind villain. Guess what happened? Oh well, I have to admit that as a stand-alone work, Assault is an above average run through the action movie motions despite how negative this review may appear. The film is not Die Hard, but neither is it Ballistic: Ecks vs Sever. And read carefully to observe that it's not that Assault does a bad job doing what it sets out to do (thank you John Leguizamo and Lawrence Fishburne for keeping things tolerable). The movie does a pretty good job delivering the goods. My problem (and this is -my- problem and not the film's) is that I find myself wishing against everything I know to be true in Hollywood for films with potential like Assault on Precinct 13 to set out with more ambition.And I'll close with an obligatory comparison to Carpenter's Assault: the Richet version is more polished with production values that leave Carpenter's little film in the dust; the script is more fleshed out with more information, motivation, development taking place; the pacing is overall faster and definitely tighter in the action sequences; and one could argue that the premise is a little more believable. However, the thing that attracts me to Carpenter's original is the low budget feel, slow quirky pacing, and naivety of a young screenwriter that shows through in the script.In the end, I don't feel like this big-budget brother to the original really gained anything; however, the new Assault did lose the classic John Carpenter vibe. And that, friends, is the difference between a rental and a purchase in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Very Very Average</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really wanted to like this film - I wasn't expecting an epic classic but I certainly expected more than I got! Overall I would say its a very average action flick. The characters, with the possible exception of Laurence Fishburns, were lacking and I truly didn't care about there fates.Towards the end I was just hoping it would hurry up and be over. I've not seen the original but I wont be put off after seeing this - I understand they are pretty different and generally I quite like Carpenters films.I'm not one of these people who automatically dislikes remakes, The Ring, Grudge etc were very good remakes but this seemed like a waste of time.It reminded me of some of the poor quality action flicks from the 80s, but in this day and age it just doesn't deliver the goods.One redeeming feature on the DVD was that the DTS sound was quite good. That can make a good film even better but it cant make a bad film good.I wouldn't say I hated this film, just didn't like a while lot about it either. Overall I've given it 4 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If i say to remind all the original version since '76,i'd lie in a huge way,i saw such flick a long time ago in a version made for TV,and perhaps there were censored parts owing to a more bounds to an explicit displaying of violence in an open signal.The plot puts cops vs. cops,when a natural born cop-slayer called Bishop(an awesome as cold-blooded Fishburne)is jailed in some accidental as brief stopping before to arrive towards his final doom along with another thugs (Leguizamo in his own as usual)in an almost locking out police prescient,the remaining cops on duty that night,eve of a new year,rather thinking to get a funny ball with relax instead,including two pretty females:a pretty doctor called Alex(Maria Bello nice&amp;talented)and a hot secretary called Iris(Drea de Matteo as sexy as talented)an obsessed chick for the sex,in the final transition between a year gone and a new to live,a surprising siege takes over the frozen outside around the precinct,a bad squad of corrupted cops commanded by a greedy officer called Marcus Duvall(the usual superb villain Gabriel Byrne!)an illegal fellow with Bishop,goes to sweep away all the clues capable to cage him in a deserved cell,no matter whoever pays the consequences,being Bishop the target to aim,the resistance into the prescient is helped by the four thieves with Bishop heading the dreadful bunch.Bullits down and up,falling the resistance step by step,a final escape is made in an underground tunnel,the main good-doer Jake Roenick(a miscast ed Ethan Hawke,good actor but i've seen him in best movies, never to compare with the original Kurt Russell),is trapped by the snipers on service to Duvall,the veteran chief Jasper O'Shea(so good Bryan Dennehy)betrays his badge and never minding about his next final on his long-time assignment and puts the survivors to the will of the wicked Duvall,but Bishop puts out his ace under his sleeve when throws a grenade over the betrayer,the typical getaway with blood and fire present of course,permits to spread the field of violence,Iris stabs a sniper,Duvall is killed by Roenick saving Bishop,this one lets a wounded Roenick exposed to his own device,but Iris gets the good and saviors cops to rescue Roenick,though Bishop fades away.This film is conventional because another police films show a similar violence and even more effective,there were holes in the plot:a bad beginning so confused,never deeply treated,unwarned cops before the undesirables and possible plains to set them free(Bishop),Didn't they think about the underground way out in a first moment?,Why to trust in such thugs?,Why to kill Alex and better not to tie her up as hostage to deal about?,the snipers were shot so easily when Bishop bursts Jaspers, Where did the rest of the snipers go when everything was over?Why to get loose Bishop in the end?,TOO MANY HOLES never to fix,the french director Richet was not the ideal one,in best hands(James Cameron,John McTiernan,Robert Rodriguez or another recognized director)the final result should be superior. Truly,i only liked those attractive and so cute mini skirted females called Drea de Matteo and Maria Bello,they are the only reason to rate this film to 5,the rest is more of "the same old thing as yesterday" like an old song said a long time ago.Thanks "The Police" for so wise phrase.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you're reading this, then maybe it's not too late. Don't watch this movie. It's a waste of precious time. Stereotypical characters (the black guy who "didn't do nuthin'", the old-timer, etc), poor plot development, pure character stupidity (it takes a rocket scientist for them to understand that the back door is a vulnerability), etc.All of this congregates in one bad remake. The original movie was credible. We really thought that it could happen. This one is just ridiculous. Even with some degree of suspension of disbelief, it is still pretty ridiculous the lengths that a bunch of veteran police officers armed to the teeth have to go to uproot a bunch of people. I got bored half-way trough the movie because it simply wasn't "doing" anything. Combine that with this being an action movie and you've got a problem. Don't waste your time.

		<shortDescription>F***ing Unimaginative But Watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The wounded undercover cop, just trying to live out his days at a desk job and overcome the guilt of his partner's death. The tough girl who is a bit more sensitive than we thought, but still tough enough to fight it out with the bad guys. The fragile (and so hot she they make her wear a sequined halter dress the whole movie) police psychiatrist. The aging (seriously, how long does the union make them work?) conservative cop who barks like a dog and trusts no one. The bad guy who might (or might not) be on our side. How many movies have these characters been in? I was thinking Mel Gibson wrote the book on the tormented cop bit, so I really wasn't too interested in Ethan Hawke, who looks extra scruffy in a bad way to me, trying for that dusty old trophy. But once everyone got trapped in the precinct and the inmate/cop dynamic flared up, things got a bit interesting. What with all the action, I was forced to pay a bit of attention. The conflicts amongst the inmates, amongst the cops, between the two groups, and the additional issues that developed as more people were brought into the mix kept me watching. Things just kept happening, too, so there wasn't a lot of time to get bored. The underground hatch scene was a little confusing - that "clean piece" thing wasn't really clear to me - but the movie was never dull.What was boring was the dialog. Was there a script, or just a plot line? Did everyone just ad-lib when it came to adverbs and adjectives of the cursing sort? It must have made for easy memorizing on the set. In a large crowd, you just don't see that...uniformity. Now that I've heard how monotonous it sounds, I'll certainly try for a little more variety as I discuss the proficiency of other drivers during the commute to work.But the premise was interesting (maybe not believable, but I was willing to go with it, anyway), and the action just kept coming. The bad guys had all their guns set on MISS, and the good guys had all their guns set on "KILL" to the point it was a bit funny, but at least things moved along fast enough that you didn't have a chance to laugh out loud. Not a bad action flick.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Major, gaping, glaring, sucking plot holes. The only thing I hate worse than a bad movie, is a bad movie that could have easily been good. This is a shining example. The basic premise is good, the setup is well-done, the characters are interesting, the acting is competent. And the thing is as full of plot holes as the precinct building was by the end of the movie. I won't re-hash them here; see the thread "Why this movie didn't work... let me count the ways..." in the message board for this film. http://us.imdb.com/title/tt0398712/board/nest/38130592The real shame is, those holes could have *easily* been plugged. A little extra thought, a little less laziness and "Eh, the stupid moviegoers won't notice," and it could have been a really good (if perhaps a bit formulaic) movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>...and on good taste, and your sensibilities....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My cinematic crystal ball tells me that "Assault On Precinct 13" will probably be a box office smash--but it just doesn't tell me why. This is a film where clichés are worked harder than rented mules, fine talent is squandered, and dialogue is dumbed down to the level of a bad sitcom. If there's a point to this film, it's cleverly concealed beneath a veneer of blood encrusted snow. And despite a plot twist that I shan't reveal, nothing can save this film from its own undoing. Replete with weapons that are too big, body counts that are too high, scenarios that are too contrived, and violence that's more than gratuitous, it's an exercise in overkill of the senses and sensibilities. There comes a time, even in Hollywood, when excess can be excessive, when violence can be simply vile, and when overindulgence can be...well...just over the top. That time just might be now, with the release of "Assault On Precinct 13".A remake of John Carpenter's 1976 movie of the same name, in which Mr. Carpenter borrowed from the premise of Howard Hawks' 1959 western, "Rio Bravo", this version is set in Detroit rather than Los Angeles, and makes cosmetic changes which defuse--or just plain avoid--the social issues and racial tension that informed and validated the original work. This time around, relatively unknown director Jean-François Richet has opted to offer up some pretty standard fare, dodging any potentially controversial topics, and play it safe by sticking to pure action.It's New Year's Eve. A time for revelry and good cheer. But things quickly take a turn for the worse when a snowstorm forces the temporary detention of a group of disparate, rag-tag, petty criminals at the soon to be closed Precinct 13 station. Did I say 'petty criminals'? Well, all but one--one Marion Bishop (Lawrence Fishburne) who is the reason for all the mayhem that will occur. Bishop is a big-time mobster who knows too much, and if he gets to trial and sings, a lot of people will go down. To prevent that, an army of well armed, well armored and faceless commandos, lays siege to the hapless Precinct 13. And it's a lopsided affair at that, with only four people to defend the station: Two cops, Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), the secretary, Iris (Drea de Matteo), and Jake's therapist, Alex (Maria Bello), who's there to have a session in his office to help him deal with his guilt and fear after a bust-gone-bad eight months earlier when several other officers were killed because of his misjudgment. When the assailants strike, Jake makes the decision to arm the detainees to help defend the station, over the objections of the soon to retire O'Shea. Now the idea of enemies uniting for common survival can make for great drama, as it did in "Rio Bravo". But not here. There's an old movie-making maxim that says, "A pie in the face is still funny--if you do it right", which, of course, doesn't just apply to pies in faces, or being funny, for that matter. And that's the problem with "Assault On Precinct 13"--it just doesn't 'do it right'.That's not to suggest or even imply that violence should be a taboo subject in film. Neither violence, nor anything else should be off limits. But taste, purpose and presentation are always considerations that should be weighed. Throughout film history, there have been many films that have been known for their graphic depictions of violence: Sam Peckinpah's "The Wild Bunch"; Stanley Kubrick's "A Clockwork Orange"; Steven Spielberg's "Saving Private Ryan". But none of these films glorified it (although others certainly have--"Precinct 13" isn't unique in that regard). Instead, it was used to make a statement about its absurdity, futility and consequences, and never as the ultimate and singular point of the film, as it is here. In this film, no one is safe from the assault, not even the viewer.© 2005</fullReview>

If you haven't figured out that Dennehy is the mole the second that you see him, pick up the phone, it's Earth calling. The gore works in places, like the death of under used Maria Bello, but is mostly overkill. Do we need to see so many people's bullet riddled foreheads? Laurence Fishburne is his stiff self, switching Fishburne and Gabriel Byrne would have made this movie far more interesting. Gabriel Bynre is at his best with ambiguous characters. John Leguizamo, as in most of his movies, plays John Leguizamo. Ethan Hawke and Drea De Matteo are the best of the bunch. The Mexican stand off between the cops and the newly weaponed criminals is the highlight. An insult to Carpenter's original with lackluster direction and a script by numbers.</fullReview>

There is a huge snow storm going on outside so a bus carrying some prisoners has to stop off there too. But what's this? People are trying to break into the station to free one of the prisoners ? Bishop, a notorious cop killer. Or are they? No! It turns out the attackers are in fact corrupt cops who want to kill Bishop because he is about to testify against them all. Twisty.There then follows a siege, with rather a high body count. It wasn't an outstanding film but it was entertaining. However, I did fall asleep during the last wee bit, though it was late, about 10.30pm for goodness sake! It was predictable in parts and wasn't especially thrilling.

		<shortDescription>B-grade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Los Angeles, 1976. Indie film brat John Carpenter, fresh out of film school and with one film - his class project's no-budget spoof of 2001 called Dark Star - under his belt, finishes a gritty actioner called Assault On Precinct 13. The story of an almost deserted police station under siege by an unseen LA gang, it was a minor hit on the drive-in circuit and garnered small praise from the few critics who cared, but it hardly set the film world on fire, unlike Carpenter's follow-up smash Halloween (1978). On Precinct, Carpenter was still learning how to exploit his almost non-existent budget by using lower-shelf actors, keeping the action to the one hellishly small location, and moving the film along at a tight pace with a combination of editing, intelligent camera work and switched-on genre savvy.No-one wants or needs to be hungry in Hollywood anymore, particularly if the week's catering bill on the 2005 version of Assault On Precinct 13 is more than the entire cost of the original. It does translate into a certain kind of laziness on a filmmaker's part - you have a stupidly large union crew, a studio and a marketing firm all doing your thinking for you. Which is why twenty years after watching Carpenter's film I can still see every glorious moment, from the small girl gunned down in cold blood while buying an ice cream, to the relentless pounding synth score. A week after Assault 2005, I remember Larry Fishburne's unmoving ping pong ball eyes and little else."Forgettable popcorn actioner" fits the top of the poster perfectly. It's New Years Eve at Precinct 13, a station closing down with a skeleton staff to see in its final hours. On call is Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), an ex-narc now deeply troubled and hopped up on Jack Daniels and Seconol after his partners were iced in the opening scene; Iris (The Sopranos' Drea de Matteo), a nympho with a thing for criminal types, and Jasper (Brian Dennehy), a crusty old timer one scotch away from retirement. As in Carpenter's Assault..., a bus with four heavy-duty criminals is rerouted to the Precinct. All boozy eyes are on gangster kingpin Bishop (Fishburne, still beefed-up from his time in the Matrix) who has narrowly survived an assassination attempt from an undercover cop and plans to blow the lid on the endemic corruption in the organized crime unit led by Marcus Duvall (a tired-looking Gabriel Byrne). Soon the phones are out, the power lines are down, and both crims and police find themselves heavily armed with a serious police arsenal and consumed with paranoia while waging war against a task force of Duvall's corrupt cops sporting white balaclavas, bullet vests, infra-red bazookas and more high-tech gear than the Skywalker Ranch. This, we're expected to believe as the helicopters buzz around the top of the police station shooting rockets into windows, is a clandestine operation to cover Duvall's tracks. He may as well have taken out billboards on Hollywood Boulevard.As with the recent Seventies genre reworking Dawn Of The Dead, Assault 2005 takes the barest plot essentials of John Carpenter's original and, to quote the Seventies, "does it's own thing, man". The main question is - why bother? John Carpenter's 1976 is a cult favorite among genre buffs, but is hardly branded in the public's collective consciousness. Carpenter himself was busy reworking Howard Hawks' classic western Rio Bravo into a tight, claustrophobic urban thriller for only $20,000. French wunderkind director and rap producer Jean-Francois Richet, a self-professed fan of John Carpenter's work, seems less concerned with making an homage to either Hawks or JC - although the script is peppered with references to cowboys and injuns - and seems intent on squeezing in as much flash and firepower as the multi-million dollar budget can withstand. The result: some tense moments with hand-held POV cameras, an unexpectedly high (and bloody) body count, a few neat plot twists, but essentially a B-grade urban actioner with a much inflated price tag. As for name-checking Carpenter, it's pure conceit on the part of the filmmakers that doesn't pay off.To Monsieur Richet, I say bon voyage, and I wish you luck on your music career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Same old stuff</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Assault on Precinct 13" is an ordinary action/drama about a handful of cops, a couple of babes, and several criminals in a soon-to-be-defunct police station house on a dark and snowy New Year's eve who come under siege by a small army of bad guys who want to kill one of the prisoners to prevent him from testifying in court. On the inside of the of the besieged police station are a sergeant with issues (Hawk) and the high value prisoner (Fishburne) who team up to deal with the threat. On the outside is the equivalent of a SWAT team led by a ruthless killer (Byrne). As this obviously contrived tale unfolds it becomes increasingly apparent it is just more of the same Hollywood B-movie material with nothing new to offer. There is, however, enough action to make for a lukewarm couch potato watch as long as the brain is disengaged and expectations are kept low. (C+)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Most of this movie will keep you thinking, "This is not what I wanted to see."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You expect it to be juvenile but you at least expect a complete and coherent movie. What a waste. I am extremely disappointed, not at just having watched a bad movie, but at having such a great concept be tainted by a common movie that we've all seen before. If this crud makes $1 over its budget, The studio would be wise to declare victory, round up all available copies, store them deep within the nuclear waste repository under Yucca Mountain, and then never make another movie like it again. Most of this movie will keep you thinking, "This is not what I wanted to see." This film appeals to the unintelligent and maybe to teenagers. It's a true shame because most movies are made for that demographic. I had much higher hopes for this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>possibly the worst movie I have ever seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>watch it and laugh at how awful the dialogue, how contrived and illogical the action, and how utterly without merit the movie is. What a waste of a cool premise with a bad antihero. I was expecting a good bad action flick, like the recent Cradle 2 the Grave, Bad Boys 2, and even Exit Wounds, but this was worthless. I wouldn't consider this a spoiler. The movie starts with dumb cops dying from really dumb mistakes and continues with more dumb cops dying/hit squad deaths. I would really hope a special combat team and even normal cops could handle combat better than a paintball or video game player, but this movie's combat could've been dreamed up by 8 yearolds in 1 try. The reason I say 1 try is because I'm sure they would have improvements after seeing the first take.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you were hoping for an avant-garde action movie produced by a Frenchman, think again - Richet is no Luc Besson.The actual action, by itself, is decent at most, and that's the only thing going for this movie.Actors performances are lackluster, screen writing is sloppy and lazy, suffering from lack of continuity and a formulaic plot, with twists so obvious, I foresaw them literally an hour before they eventually took place.Characters are superficial and stereotypical, and fail to promote empathy, sympathy, or any other sentiments for them. Decisions and actions made by the characters (both "good guys" and "bad guys") often fail to make any sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple storyline, but entertaining...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason I never got around to watching "Assault on Precinct 13" until ten years after it was released. Why? Well, I can't claim to be overly much a fan of Ethan Hawke or Lawrence Fishburne. And it wasn't until I saw it shown on TV that I actually sat down to watch this movie.There are some pretty good talents on the cast list aside from Ethan Hawke and Lawrence Fishburne; talents that include John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy and Gabriel Byrne. I actually didn't know that John Leguizamo was in this movie before seeing him, and he alone would make it worthwhile watching.There certainly was a lot of violence throughout the movie, which does spice up the enjoyment of the movie quite a lot.And while the story was leaning towards being fairly shallow and simplistic, then some good acting performances and the action did more than weigh up for the lack of storyline.All in all, an alright crime action movie. It doesn't put your mind on any challenge, but it is still an enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartbreakingly disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even in its own right, this picture is unrealistic, jaded, and all-around silly. It wouldn't merit more than four stars. However, it is in comparison to its 1973 namesake that this scam of a movie truly gets to showcase just how abysmal it is.The original was dynamic, replete with action, and almost believable. It let the acting and plot (in that order) do the work. Even today, it would earn 6-7 stars easily. This abomination though can muster neither. The acting sucks because the plot sucks, hence the need for two hot chicks and fancy explosions. I mean, when in the first five minutes we're treated to a buxom woman with a short tight skirt, fishnet stockings, and high-heeled boots, then it ain't hard to see where we're headed. And the sexual tension between the pretty shrink and the "sarge" (who looks like somebody who would've washed out of rookie training, never mind gotten several promotions) just affirms the producers' desperation.Lastly, this picture is a time and a half as long as its predecessor. Regrettably, the added 50% is mostly used for trite, utterly forgettable dialog rather than interesting plot twists or some development of the cookie-cutter, one-dimensional characters.Bonus negative points: the ultra-P.C. script (well, for the most part). True, the main protagonist is now a Caucasian unlike in the original iteration. However, the perps are all either small-time crooks or, but of course, totally innocent of any wrongdoing. No rapists or brutal murderers here! It's Rolex counterfeiters and a victimized African-American woman who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time. Riiiiiiiiiiiiiight. And the assailants are not some expendable, no-good hoodlums found only if the bottom of the barrel of society is scratched real hard; nope, they're police officers. Dozens of them. All corrupt and murderous... - and white. Boy, oh boy...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing Fantastic, But Enjoyable Enough</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've not seen the original film - yet - so I've nothing to compare this remake to, but if the original is as enjoyable as this then I'll be looking forward to seeing what all the fuss is about. I know remakes can get battered by a lot of people true to the original films, but instead of complaining about them, I like to have an open mind, and it's only after watching them I'll comment.Not all remakes/reboots are bad.Anyway, this version of Assault on Precinct 13 is a very decent action/thriller that's (mostly) well scripted, well filmed, and very well acted. I say "mostly" with regard to the well scripted comment because there were a couple of moments where the dialogue was a bit cheesy. Thankfully it was only mild cheese instead of full blown blue stilton. Then again, I guess you can't have an action film without at least some cheese. Other than that, however, the film is written well enough with a nice wee twist at the end.One thing that can sometimes be ignored in a lot of action films is the cinematography but with this film I enjoyed some of the outdoor scenes with the way the makers set the tone &amp; atmosphere using the weather. It's not a huge thing and it is subtle but for me it was a nice touch.The main cast all give solid performances, from John Leguizamo's portrayal as Beck, a somewhat amusing (yet slightly annoying at the same time) small-time crook, to Laurence Fishburne's role of Marion Bishop, a more calculating &amp; menacing mob boss.For me, the only unrealistic element of the film was the amount of police that ended up being involved. I mean the initial group led by Gabriel Byrne is understandable given the circumstances, but in the end it just went a bit over-the-top. But, this IS an action film and not a documentary, so, again, unrealistic moments are to be expected and it's not as if it ruins the experience.As long as you're not naive to expect something fantastic, then you should find this film enjoyable enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as good as the original, but still worthwhile</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everybody knows that remakes are never much cop ? very rarely do they improve on the often classic originals. ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 isn't better than the John Carpenter film from the '70s, but it IS a decent remake. This is because it updates and changes the original film in positive ways that make it different enough to be worth watching. That, and the fact that it's a very good little thriller in itself.The gang in the Carpenter movie was scary because it was random. There was no motive, just the fact that they were out to kill people for the fun of it. That's gone in this movie; the gang here has a definite motive that leads them into a life-or-death struggle for survival. There's a big twist which I won't reveal, but the fact that the gang are all armoured and possessing high-power weapons makes them even more of a threat than in the original movie. I loved it. Key scenes from the Carpenter movie are revisited, but turned around on their head to seem fresh and new.The worst thing about the film is probably the script, which relies far too heavily on profanity for effect. This is a big no-no, in my opinion, and reveals a dearth of imagination in James De Monaco's screenplay. Still, French director Jean-Francois Richet makes a decent fist of it, investing his film with plenty of suspense and tension, and the action scenes are all very well handled. I was frequently on the edge of my seat, and I haven't been able to say that about many recent action films from Hollywood. The only bit I didn't like was a bit ripped off from DIE HARD 2 where an icicle is used to dispatch a bad guy.ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 also benefits from an ensemble cast who make the best of what the script gives them. Ethan Hawke, who I never have liked ? and still don't like much ? works hard in the lead hero role. His work doesn't quite pay off and make him charismatic, but I think he does a good job, for what it's worth. Laurence Fishburne's still trading on his 'king of cool' image that he gained from THE MATRIX trilogy, so he doesn't have to do much work here, but he's one of the actors holding it all together. Gabriel Byrne is underused, as is Brian Dennehy, although it's nice to see the latter actor back on screen in a role reminiscent of his one from FIRST BLOD. Elsewhere we have John Leguizamo (CARLITO'S WAY) having fun as an on-the-edge addict, Maria Bello a little out of place, Ja Rule better than he was in HALF PAST DEAD, Kim Coates playing a jerk yet again, and Drea de Matteo as a lowlife. What's more to say?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Title: Assault on Precinct 13 Condensed Storyline: A police officer must get police and prisoners to unite and fight together to stop corrupt cops who are trying to capture one of the prisoners who would incriminate all he corrupt police. Notable Acting: I cannot take Laurence Fishburne seriously when I see he playing a gangster, as much as I like the actor and liked him in this movie, I feel that someone else would have been better, such as Jamie Fox or another actor or that sorts. Ethan Hawke plays the believable police Sargent who is left in the precinct under fire. Everyone else decent, not all too believable for some as they did act like they knew they were going to be killed off in the movie, so it made it harder for me to like them. Noticeable Camera work: Reverse mirror shot for when Jake is washing his face and looking in the mirror and the camera takes over by only showing his reflection Birds eye view of the prison transport container leaving God damn shaky cam in the break in sceneOverall Feel: This is one of those films which I like because of it's subtle political message, this has, does and always will happen in some police or governmental force somewhere in the world. Similar to 'Enemy of the State' this is realistic to an extent as this sort of thing can and does happen. The acting in the movie is good, the plot is slightly predictable but great to watch regardless along with its few twists and turns in the movie. Amazing action thriller, a step above and beyond the 76 movie of the same name. There isn't much else to write about the movie, as it is a good action thriller inside and out with a semi-realistic plot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake Assault on precinct 13 serves as a good action movie. I have not really seen the original one, but when I watched this out it surely made me feel that I got my money's worth, as I was looking for a movie with Thrill and Action. Ethan Hawke playing a good cop does justice to the movie and Laurance Fishburne with great acting skills playing a mobster with a serious look on his face tells you that he means business! This film is Bloody And Ballsy!It's set on the New Year's Eve and it takes loads of blood, bodies and action till the movie ends until sunrise! So watch it for yourself I'm sure the action lovers will have a fairly good time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A solid remake of a solid original. While it never really gets the blood racing and is less riveting than its predecessor, the movie gets a lot of mileage out of its various twists and turns (some predictable, some not so much) and a welcome lack of predictability in when characters will be killed off.It's a good looking film, too, full of snowy atmosphere. It gets pretty silly at certain junctures, though: the assault is awfully drawn out considering how well armed and ruthless the enemy is, the bad guys lose the ability to aim at moments convenient for the good guys, and as for that handy tunnel... Hurm.Still, not bad at all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a vanilla twist in sight.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An update of the Carpenter classic, which itself was an update of Rio Bravo, the film is slightly different, this has more to do with police corruption, rather than a gang getting revenge.It's a slightly different film for Hawke to be in, he must have been funding something, but he really excels in this movie.There is some sort of back story involving Hawke and a NARC style opening, but that just sets the mood for the rest of the film, showing that Hawkes Character is weak, thus making the group vulnerable.Then we have Fishburne as the 'bad' guy. He is all swagger in this and very little else. It's as if he's saying 'I was just in three of the biggest science fiction films of the last ten years which were not Star Wars and don't you forget it!!!'.Byrne is wasted, looking moody and cold. Th rest of the cast are okay, especially Bello, who does convince as a 'shrink'.But what is most striking about the film is how brutal and relentless the film is. No one is safe, and the director doesn't flinch when disposing of characters (Bello the most significant), and this makes the film a little more urgent.It's nothing special, not a patch on the original, and Fishbourne becomes annoying toward the end, but for a little standalone action movie, it passes the time, and the brutality makes it deeply unsettling.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a remake of John Carpenter's original "Assault", this was fairly well done. The acting was better than the plot/character development.The overall concept is far-fetched as there's no way so many police officers, even corrupt ones, would turn against their own so quickly &amp; uniformly. Things fit together a bit too well. The same objective could have been successful by using a three or four persons instead of some blindly loyal army of corrupt cops. I did, however, enjoy Laurence Fishbourne and Ethan Hawke. Seems IL' Ethan has learned quite a bit since "Training Days"! On of those noticeable gaffs was the inmate transport bus that had burned most of the night yet somehow still had snow on top of it. I also didn't realize there was so much wooded area around the Detroit industrial parks. Hmmm.... Some viewers are troubled by cops becoming the antagonists and a bad guy almost becoming the protagonist. To me, I can see how corruption can grow like a cancer when left unchecked and how power/greed can divide even a police force. Innocent victims get caught in the crossfire. Though the corruption in this movie seems a bit too widespread and the overall plan too extreme, I could see where corrupt officers would see blaming an enemy force for the death of a few innocents to protect themselves would be very logical. I'd recommend this for video rental of VOD.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very silly but a bit of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many John Carpenter films seem to be getting the remake treatment now days. Recently we have had the remake of The Thing. A not so great movie that apparently is not a patch on the original (I wouldn't know I haven't seen it). In the last few years we have also had the Halloween remake, which again was not a patch on the original (this one I have seen). The Assault On Precinct 13 remake was released a few years before both of these and by all accounts is yet another John Carpenter remake that has gone horribly wrong (again I have not seen the original of this).We start the film with a drug addicted Ethan Hawke, motor mouthing his way through a potential drug deal. Expectantly the deal goes awry and we find out that Hawke is in fact a cop undercover. The mission goes horribly wrong and through his call, his two team members are killed. Eight months later and Hawke is having psychological difficulties because of the incident, and finds himself working in a run-down Precinct behind a desk. Hawke is called in to work on New Year's Eve, along with other officers who are unhappy about working this night. Hawke looks at it as an easy shift considering the Precinct is to shut down at midnight and that he is having a meeting with his sexy psychiatrist, Maria Bello.Elsewhere cop killer Marion Bishop (Fishburne) has been arrested and is being transported out of town, along with some petty criminals, however the snow storm is causing the driver problems, and he is forced to stop at Precinct 13 for the night, much to Hawke's disapproval.With the prisoners locked up, Hawke gets an unexpected guest; his sexy psychiatrist. She turns up after being stranded in the snow ever since she left him earlier in the day. Something may cheer him up after all. His slight cheer is short lived though, as two men break into the precinct and Hawke and his cops engage in a shoot out, forcing their intruders out. The only explanation they have for this is that it is Bishop's men come to break him out of prison.Whilst a large team set up outside, Hawke assembles his cops ready to fight back, but when he wrestles with an intruder one on one he finds out the man is a cop. Turns out the people on the outside are corrupt cops bent on killing Bishop so he can't point them out in court. This means everyone inside will have to be killed in order to keep all these cops from going to jail. What plays out is a large force of cops attempting to bust into a tiny precinct protected by a handful of local cops and a handful of prisoners, meaning tension hits high inside the precinct especially between Hawke and Fishburne.The plot of the film is something we have all seen before. Something that you are willing to watch when you need an easy action flick to keep you occupied. What we have here is a full film of continuous shoot outs, all involving pretty horrible shooters. For starters we have a man hiding behind a bus, shooting in front of him, failing to hit two men who are wide open, but somehow as these two men run from the fire, they manage to shoot behind them and take this man out. From this moment on I was expecting something silly. Next we have Hawke standing with a semi-automatic weapon, five men lined up in front of him and he misses them all. Some cop he is. There are also sniper's who line up shots, only to miss them when they pull the trigger. These guys are supposed to be cops and they can't hit a target. As you can see the shoot outs become a little silly, and they are the only thing that keeps this film entertaining.Ethan Hawke played his role very well in the film. The opening scene alone was strong and I only wish the film remained like that. Fishburne was delivering his lines in a sleazy way which was very off putting. Ever since his role as Morpheus in The Matrix I've found it very hard to believe him as anyone else. Gabriel Byrne has very little to do and is just a very generic, one-dimensional action flick character.The sense I got from the film was that it wanted to be Die Hard. From the snowy exterior, to the Christmassy soundtrack all I kept thinking was Die Hard. I was just waiting for John McClane to make a dirty vested cameo. The film is very average but watchable for an action junkie. I think I need to sit down and watch all of John Carpenter's work as by the sounds of it not one of the remakes is anywhere near as good as the originals. All I have heard is excellent things about Carpenter films and perhaps I should take people's word for it. By all accounts the original of Assault On Precinct 13 is far better and I recommend that you only watch this version if you can't get your hands on that. 2.5 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethan Hawke isn't his character at all. I couldn't buy him in action. And he looked so small in the massive presence of Laurence Fishburne, to an extent where he, Hawke, wasn't originally shown in Fishburne's big shadow. Let alone being with Maria Bello, who seemed older than him (age?, charisma?, whatever..). According to Hawke's looks, he was more fit to play her younger brother, not her possible lover ! John Leguizamo is annoying as an actor and a character. The best relief he ever did was by leaving the movie for good. I was yelling when his character got killed off "Hurray, no more Leguizamo ANYMORE !", then cried out of happiness !The movie is dryer than the sand of all the deserts of the earth. Save Leguizamo's joke there was no funny or even good line around. Whether the one who wrote it had no time, or no sense of humor. Apparently that was remedied, as always lately, by putting a "F**K" word every now and then. Ahh, I believe that saying this word, and naturally its derivatives, in a Hollywood movie nowadays became essential to be realistic, cool, compensating, convenient. While it ends up, every single time, as disgusting, exaggerating, repetitive, boring !Artistically, the French director Jean-Francois Richet wanted the image as something sharply doesn't get out of holy trinity : white, black and dark blue. That captured the dim atmosphere of the events, but was wearisome a little. Plus, the directing handled the whole action as if it's running in 3 meters long, 3 meters wide room. It isn't catchy. Thank god for that editing, without it this movie could have been a dud !Some points in that script did provoke : the evil enemy must be a corrupted police officer (remember the good, very old, days when the evil enemy was the criminal !). The evil men, while taking all the leads captive, waited so long to just shoot any one of them. And seriously.. why the evil team didn't blow up the police station earlier ?!, that would have saved them A LOT OF TIME !The good side remains in : Bello's performance as neurotic psychiatrist. Undoubtedly her last scene, while standing as "brave", was the best of her, and the best of this movie. Any 2 seconds of Brian Dennehy is great, sorrowfully he didn't have longer time on-screen. To whoever may concern; I would prefer him, being old as he is, in the lead role. Actually Ethan Hawke can't compete with this cooliness and glamour. And Fishburne's sedate voice did thrill me more than all the action sequences !So, let me see : an action movie without notable action. A lead that doesn't convince as a lead (he's not just miscast, he also makes all the good cast miscast in front of him !). And nothing special further than the general plot. Hence, it's another hallow entertainment, yet between usual and uninteresting despite the unusual interesting potential. Its tagline says "The only people more dangerous than the hardened criminals... are the cops." Based on the contemporary scene of inflated accelerated production, numerous hasty remakes with ensured old story, and no time for something new or boldly different, I think that the only people more dangerous than the hardened criminals... are the producers ! Connect between the fact of this movie as a remake and its 127 "F**K" words, to know well that the script, as a pure element, lives unprecedented crises in Hollywood of today. Or should I say Follywood for that matter ?!P.S : In his review Mr. Roger Ebert described Drea de Matteo, the station's secretary (Iris), as buxom. Well, get a new glasses, PAL !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, this one sure is not a masterpiece as, to say the truth, neither was the original. This one lacks the portrayal of times and, may I say, "a talent" but delivers action better and that is no wonder considering a gap in budget and almost 30 years of progress between both. Violence is higher than in average Hollywood action and there is no mercy for the characters except the lead roles, of course. No wonder again, as the director is french. All in all good enough shootout movie, but if you wanna see a really good one in this area better look for french flick called The Nest made few years before this one. Why didn't they hire Nest's director for this remake if they wanted a Frenchman so badly? He would have probably done it much better.P.S. For all the smarts around - there actually is a "device" which can "block" cell signals in certain area invented and in constant use all around the world and, yes, you probably can't shoot a bullet through a snowdrift near the road as it is made by pushing snow off the road and is often "icy" and no sniper would take a shot without clear target when his own men are wandering the area, thought I kept wondering how can you hide from a sniper on the roof by hiding behind a snowdrift?

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 has some pretty cool, if not big, boots to fill. And I thought it filled them pretty damn well. The film strips away most unnecessary exposition and ploughs straight into the action. There is an admirable lack of sentimentality about the characters and about the way in which they are picked off. The casting is key in this film and whilst Gabriel Byrne is under-used (and subsequently looks uninterested) it's nice to see familiar faces like Brian Dennehy and Drea De Matteo (Adriana from The Sopranos) get substantial roles. The action rolls along at a fair lick and despite a small lull about an hour in the tension is kept up. Special mention goes to Laurence Fishburne who seems to grow in stature through the course of the film.www.chrisvscinema.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting homage to Carpenter original, refreshing idea</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am big fan of John Carpenter since my youth age, but for me the real Carpenter era ended with the movie "They Live". Even the later works was quite fine, the "Vampires" I really don't like that much. However I am always excited about any new movie Carpenter make, because in any of them there is always "piece" of Carpenter. Same goes with the remakes, that are mostly low than average result, except some of them that are substantial. Maybe it is because of my big expectations or because I always try to find scent of real Carpenter in them. But Carpenter is Carpenter, you cannot copy him.Anyway, original "Assault on precinct 13" is a movie that I already watched dozen times, so I did not expect to find any similarity in any segment in this remake, but I was curious to see how Jean-François Richet design the intensity of the plot and characters developing. Based on the earlier Carpenter movie, and made on screenplay of James DeMonaco, the movie only recall the nostalgia on Carpenter masterpiece. I was really surprised watching so many known actors, and they make their work pretty good, all of them. As for this movie, it is actually very good, but important is to not compare it in any segment with original, but only as a unique work that represents core of the original idea.At first I was disappointed with the stating scene in the movie, which ends with the assassins of two colleagues of leading character Sgt. Jake Roenick played by ambitious Ethan Hawk, but then I realized how director made good development of leading character with that, and I was satisfied. This goes to the general development of the characters, their mutual relation and the whole concept of the movie.In the original the core element in creation of the plot was character of the father of little girl (assassinated by one of the members of the gang), and in this movie we have main bad guy character (played by excellent Laurence Fishburne). I don't want to make absolute spoiler here, so I will not continue to uncover it for those who did not see that movie yet.At the end just as conclusion how hard is to try make remake of something rare in movie industry. Maybe director did not try to beat the original, but it was very well made and gave us descent memory on what Carpenter once made, with refreshing piece of good thrill.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jean-François Richet recreates John Carpenter's classic action-fueled cop story Assault on Precinct 13 with sharp, deft strokes, not shunning violence or adrenaline doses in the process. It is a film that promises a fast pace and Claustrophobic atmosphere ? zooming in on a police station on the brink of abandonment on snowy New Year's Eve; dirty cops surrounding the fort to get to a criminal inside, and the cops in the station having to fight off their attackers ? and it delivers accordingly, no pretense about it.But it needs to be said that its delivery of action is still regrettably marred by formulaic elements, characters and plot- twists and turns. The stormy, snowy, freezing night force a wide variety of characters to barricade themselves in the precinct such as the sex-crazed secretary who spends the film in black high-heeled latex boots (?!), flirtatiously portrayed by Drea De Matteo. The same riff can be applied to Maria Bello's performance as sexy "doctor", yet she aptly possesses a certain vulnerability which in many ways relegates her to an even more clichéd character ? the damsel in distress. The focal figure ? a burnt-out Sergeant who broods over the death of his partner ? is also stained by stereotypical developments. I am in fact pressed to find a character that does not fall prey to the clichéd formula at least once. Thankfully, Assault on Precinct 13 can boast of an ensemble (Gabriel Byrne, Ethan Hawke, Maria Bello, John Leguizamo, Laurence Fishbourne) that is strong and assured enough to avoid the most cringeworthy moments and cheesiest one-liners.In fact, the film purposely takes no such action approach. Instead it shifts into clear-eyed and realistic mode, not shying away from bleeding gunshot wounds and suchlike. When you least expect it, Richet wields his story in Hitchcockian ways and kills off important characters in the story, throwing in a light twist or two. The dark snowy night is no Christmas fairytale, but a dark parable on whom to trust and not; a gloomy, grey, hard-boiled, hopeless cop-story set in dire circumstances. It is its many characters that either remain underdeveloped or simply too clichéd (I know that word is overused, but here it is rightfully applied) for Assault on Precinct 13 to be elevated about generic formula. Nevertheless, the film is a suspenseful pasttime.6 out 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nice premise, an excellent cast. However this thriller is let down somewhat by the salivating armoury fetishism and sieve of a script (i.e. implausibilities). There's also a problem with the way in which director Jean-François Richet sticks it all together: the film lurches between action and stasis, without any tapering of suspense.Ethan Hawke reprises (from Training Day and Lord of War) his unimpeachably moral lawman - this time he's rather more street though. Lawrence Fishburne has found some form of late. This well-pitched turn preceded a pungent cameo as an intelligence service honcho in MI3. Gabirel Byrne is an undercredited accessory of equal weight. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie just makes me angry!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gah! This movie is "Panic Room" all over again! Terrific actors, cool setting, suspenseful beginning -- I really thought I was going to like it -- and then it all goes to hell once we find out the infiltrator's story! Not that it was a surprise since the trailers had already decided to ruin the movie and tell me the invaders were bad cops intent on killing a mob boss who would become informant, but unfortunately, this movie is full of easy-to-guess plots and circumstances that just plain make ya angry! I usually try to leave spoilers out of reviews but I can't help but mention some of the unforgivable flaws in this movie. For example, if you can't figure out who the traitor is in Precinct 13 in the first few minutes of the assault, then you need to watch more movies. But the thing that turns me off the most about this movie was that near the end, the building is set on fire, and the traitor lures the remaining Precinct 13 defenders through a basement sewer tunnel into a trap where the bad cops are waiting. So my question is WHY DIDN'T HE BLEEPITY-BLEEP DO THAT IN THE BEGINNING?! Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know, your smart aleck answer is because there wouldn't be a two hour movie. Maybe your answer is because the firemen would interfere, and they do respond to the fire, but how the heck were they notified? I thought the bad cops shut off all phone lines, radio transmissions, power, and ANYTHING that allowed communication with the outside world. Bah! Thinking about this movie will just infuriate me more. There is only one positive thing I have to say: Congratulations for killing the shrink! She was well on her way to the cliché "we're trapped in an impossible situation, so let's get to know each other and fall for each other" love story. I was genuinely shocked when they shot her in the head halfway through the movie. I just knew we were going to be treated with a "Gremlins" story about fathers getting stuck in chimneys, followed with her coming out of that thing like Bruce Willis' wife in "Die Hard." So congratulations to the filmmakers for shocking the hell out of me with that event. I just wish it hadn't been the only one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When a tag line bears "From the producers of Training Day" and Ethan Hawke leads, you think you are about to embark on an original, gritty, siege drama, that cuts through the standard Hollywood cop bull so often sprayed across our theatre screens- or so you would think.The difficulty with trying to remake a classic is, well, the original. Horror maestro- John carpenter succeeded with his 1976 thriller by stripping the plot down to the basics: Both police and crooks alike are in trouble. There's a storm and everyone has a pretty good chance of dying, oh and there's loads of bad guys coming. All these ingredients make for a tasty brew of genre splicing accomplishment. There are no smoke or mirrors as the original plays out like a zombie movie where the heroes have no chance.In the folding chair is Jean-François Richet who creates a promising opening sequence. Hawke gives us a taste of his Oscar nominated capabilities straight off of his "officer Jake Hoyt" in Training Day. As Roenick, Hawke, loses his team, during a drug-bust, setting up the clichéd scarred-cop who's after redemption. The effectiveness and credibility given to the opening sequence is lost as the assault on the precinct ensues. We have a glimpse of undercover police work, the dangers and (in)effectiveness but then the 'good guys inside versus the bad guys outside' plot just doesn't hold you firmly enough to avoid slipping from your chair into a comatose state or making for the exist pulling strands of hair from your head protesting against remakes.This film is clearly a "pay-the-rent-issue," another opportunity for studios to cash in on old hats. Maria Bello takes the strong female lead but is perma-exposed solely to avoid the film inducing mass-sleep (a good move if you ask me) and the Training Day references (I counted 7), ranging from the same names (Jake, Smiley) being used and the same lines being spat.Note: Not all is bad with Hollywood's latest dust-off. Wide-angle action shots increase the sense of isolation and it holds its own tension-wise as the snow engulfs the soon to be doomed precinct 13. Viewers may think they have developed psychic ability as the predictable plot drools to an expected climax.Make no mistake; this is a classically scripted cliché that can only be above average, due to Hawke's performance. The mere screen presence of the supporting cast sees Gabriel Byrnes' bad guy underused and Laurence Fishburne's crime lord too ambiguous to feel or hate him. Ja Rule is pointless as the third-person referring 'Smiley' but John Leguizamo puts in a comic performance as an anxious drug addict. The biggest positive would be Hawke making the most of his material but it is hard to say how the film would fair without his acting weight?"not well" springs to mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>routine action during a snow storm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jean-Francois Richet remakes this almost classical B-movie by John Carpenter, and the result is ... well, an average 21st century B-movie. A film that starts quite well, with logic and well defined characters, but ends in a rather common festival of shooting and almost total demolition and killing. Along there are some good action moments, some nice character acting and a strong appearance by Laurence Fishburne, and some big logic holes in the script, but we are all ready to forget them because this is a B-movie, and this is what you expect from a film in this category. The setting is a soon-to-be-closed police station, and a terrible winter storm that cuts all communication and tries to provide some credibility to thousands of gunshots remaining unobserved even on a New Years Eve night. The good thing with this kind of films is that you know what to expect, the bad thing is that you usually get exactly what you expect. Go for it if you are looking for some well filmed action, do not expect any surprises.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thin Action Gruel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is a little like a cops vs. criminals Night of the Living Dead: obnoxious, half-sketched characters are barricaded inside a structure besieged by a relentless, homicidal enemy; bickering between various factions gives way to team-work; people die one-by-one until only the highest-billed cast-members remain. As with a film of the Living Dead series, the fun is less in guessing how the heroes will escape their dire situation than in relishing their demises, each of which represents a subtraction of one loud, irritating voice from the mindless cacophony the director is attempting to pass off as evidence of dramatic tension. Assault on Precinct 13 mistakes loud for interesting, but at least the pacing is brisk, which means you don't have to wait very long to clear away the annoying characters. The sad thing is how unimaginative the deaths are; you'd think highly-paid screenwriters could come up with more creative, ironic ways for the characters to be bumped-off, but no, the expirations in Assault on Precinct 13, though violent enough, are conspicuously lacking in kick. It's enough to make one long for the hand of a Tarantino, or at the very least a Miike, someone who knows how to make death into sadistic fun.The story is set on a blizzard-ravaged Detroit New Year's Eve. The denizens of Precinct 13 are looking forward to a nice quiet last evening in their old precinct-house (it's about to be closed up), but fate intervenes in the form of a storm-stranded prisoner-transport bus, which is forced to stow its four jail-bound passengers in the precinct's holding pen. The situation is complicated (boy is it complicated) by the prominence of one of the prisoners, a famed crime-lord named Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne, his Morpheus gravitas intact), who has enemies in high places; bent on silencing Bishop forever, some heavily-armed, apparently commando-trained guys storm the precinct-house, turning the place into a hurricane of breaking glass and splintered furniture. The man charged with getting a handle on the situation, Sgt. Roenick (Ethan Hawke, keyed-up as usual), is a traumatized desk-jockey with a severe case of responsibility-aversion; he decides to arm the prisoners, including Bishop, with whom he finds himself engaged in a sort of low-level clash-of-personalities (the self-doubting semi-hero vs. the pragmatic semi-villain). The resulting mayhem is sporadic and not especially impressive, despite director Jean-Francois Richet's lucid staging and strong sense of pace. The problem is largely setting-based - there just isn't that much to do with a snow-bound urban precinct house, there are only so many windows to break and desks to duck behind. The only way to make hay with this kind of story is by delving into psychology, the effect of tension on the characters, but this would require a level of patience, not to mention writing skill, beyond what the creators of this film are capable of. The characters are given a few little psychological quirks, and the actors do what they can with them, but none of this adds up to anything resembling human interest. At some point there's nothing left to do but wait for the characters to get it, but even when they do it's not particularly satisfying. The film is ultimately a thin gruel of unlikely plotting, dully realistic treatment and half-hearted psychological sketching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Marcus Duvall still lives. To me this is unacceptable." Gosh! That was perhaps the only cool line in the entire film. You know, if it wasn't for Laurence Fishburn, or Gabriël Byrne for that matter, I think I would have stopped the film in 20 minutes and watched some 'family guy'-episodes in order to compensate for the brain damage caused by the terrible dialogue in this motion picture. Since I have not seen the original film (and God knows I will not do so), I am unable to judge this picture as a remake: to me it's a movie on its own, not excused in any way as 'at least true to its source'. I thought using lines such as "Dammit Sarge" and "Take the shot son..." (or something like that) were forbidden by international aesthetic dialogue-laws since Clarck Johnson unleashed the "S.W.A.T."-Monster in 2003 (Remember the tagline? "Even cops dial 911", are you kidding me?)Anyway, this movie seemed to me as being the latest 'Home Alone'-flick, that would be part 17, but instead of little Kevin keeping the bad guys out of his parent's house with marbles on the floor and a stapler attached to the door-knob, Ethan Hawke tries to defend an entire police-station against 33 highly trained SWAT-members armed to the teeth (Oh no! not SWAT again!), only aided by a crazy junkie, a high-heeled 'babe'-secretary who looks like she's 50, a severely borderlined shrink, a hooded woman who apparently is in the wrong movie, Ja Rule (Now its getting crazy, I know), and finally, THANK GOD, Laurence Fishburne as some sort of godfatherly gangster. Am I done? Oh no, I forgot about the obvious 'Good Cop', and you know what that means....Yeah, I don't need to tell you, but we all know one person is a traitor, hmmm...who would that be.... Well, after they shot up the entire station during a period of ....the whole movie..... it finally comes down to the deadly stand-off scene, preluded by a Good 'ol Car-roll a la "the A-team", you know how those go.... 'Wait a sec, there is some sort of car-launching device at the left side of the road, let me drive over it and see what happens.. Oh no!!!' crash. The stand-off. The ultimate battle between good and evil, with Gabriël Byrne, Laurence Fishburne, a henchman of Gabriël Byrne and Ethan Hawke. Bang, shot, aww, bang bang bang, ah I've been hit, bang bang. That's it, Laurence gets away, dawn breaks and Ethan is rescued by the cavalry (Drea de Matteo with the Detroit Fire Dep.) With a final and, might I add, irresistible line "Happy New Year Sarge" I realise I wasted an hour and a half of my life, without noticing it! Hey, I guess time flies when you're having fun, so I might just have liked the movie in some crazy way, perhaps by having a laugh at the incredibly lame dialogue. One thing was striking though; an unexpected twist in the plot. The crazy shrink was supposed to kiss Ethan Hawke in the end, but no, BANG! She's shot in the head by Byrne. Man, shocking, now that was something unexpected! The fact that this film made me loose track of time is perhaps the only reason why I can grade it a 5. It was not worth watching, not even when you feel like a numb-headed-police-action-flick, such as "Training Day", which made Ethan Hawke look quite good (or was that because of Denzel?). In 'Assault on Precinct 13', he failed miserably in adding some depth to his, apparently, complicated character, but I guess the script is to blame. Since I am not an expert when it comes to this genre, my comments might be useless for anyone who enjoyed, lets say, SWAT. However, I think it is a director's duty to try and take the genre of the film to a higher level. In my eyes, Jean-Francois Richet failed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A notorious crime figure (Laurence Fishburne as Marion Bishop ) is finally nabbed, but on his way to the main jail the police van is diverted because of really bad New Year's Eve winter weather. It happens to be to the precinct 13 building which is to be permanently closed down the next day. So, it has a skeleton crew, led by Ethan Hawke as desk Sgt. Jake Roenick , expecting to just spend a quiet evening with a low key celebration to bring in the new year. What seemed incongruous to me is that such a notorious criminal would be sent there without appropriate police reinforcements. Anyway, the whole of the movie, as the title tells us, is an assault, on New year's eve, on precinct 13 to get at Marion Bishop. Maria Bello has a good role as a police therapist stranded there. And Brian Dennehy as the retiring policeman.SPOILERS: The assumption by all, audience and characters alike, that Bishop's men are trying to break him out. Nope! It was a band of bad cops, who were in business with Bishop, and were intent on killing him before he had a chance to expose them. Maybe that's why no reinforcements were sent to Pct. 13, because Bishop was diverted there by the bad cops. So the whole "battle" is to see if the small crew of men and women, even enlisting the help of several petty prisoners, can hold off the bad cops who seem equipped to fight a whole rogue nation. Turns out Dennehy, who leads them to "safety" via a tunnel, is in with the bad cops, and leads the group into a trap. The good guys prevail anyway, only Bishop and Hawke's character survive, they part in the snowy woods.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never saw the original John Carpenter film, but this is just what the doctor ordered after sitting through a bunch of pretentious films lately. On a snowy New Years Eve, an understaffed old precinct, which is about to be shut down, is under attack by a group of dirty cops who want to cover-up their tracks by killing off one of the captives held inside.Ethan Hawke plays Jake, a cop hiding behind a desk in a low risk precinct trying to escape his past. When a bus of cons is rerouted to his precinct because of a storm, he must enlist the help of the cons when he needs help fending off the assault. One of the captors is Laurence Fishburne, who is a famous cop killer and drug dealer. The guys on the outside want him badly and will kill anybody to get to him.The cast is great. Brian Dennehy, Maria Bello, John Leguziamo, Dorian Harewood, Gabriel Byrne, Matt Craven, and Currie Graham are all in this film as well. This movie is an edge of your seat thriller in the "Die Hard" style. I haven't seen a good gun toting action thriller in a long time and it was just what I needed. (***1/2)</fullReview>

It has action, drama, and that little touch of comedy here and there that every movie needs.The movie mostly has a dark setting and is very quiet. This movie revolves around a police station where everyone is being held inside, even every prisoner. They are not being held inside by force, they are being held inside by assassins around the outside of the station.The acting in this movie is very solid as it establishes enough about the characters for me to actually feel a bit of compassion for them.This is one of the best action films of 2005 and it at least warrants a viewing at the 99 cent theater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I do wish they had a MINUS number for these movies.The thing is, the acting wasn't too terrible. THE MOVIE ON THE OTHER HAND WAS UNPLEASANT.Someone else on here made a fairly nonsense comment about how good guys don't die in these movies, which is untrue it happens all the time.The plot line is actually not bad, the idea of cops going after a cop killer to cover their own involvement with a gang-lord was a pretty good idea.BUT the followup is just plain terrible.The plot holes have been outlined by others, but the obvious part is how stupidly these people do things to begin with. NO ONE would have jumped into the car without first checking to see if anyone was in the backseat. We saw that coming a mile away.The unnecessary brutality of the movie made it very unpleasant to watch. I didn't like seeing the Dr. so callously blown away and it was very unneeded in this movie. That part made the movie very very bad.At that point I lost all interest in the movie completely and watched the rest because everyone else said at least see how it ends, but without a single exception everyone agreed this movie pretty much stunk and the reasons were as much because of the killing of all the good people and as much as it added nothing to the plot line.The hitting of the dog was pretty bad too. I can't see why movie producers seem to think hurting animals(even if it isn't real)is good entertainment.I mean how desperate are they to attract ANYONE to the movie that they have to include animal cruelty and shooting nice people in the head?Don't waste your time for even a second with this piece of crap.No wonder movies are taking a hit, they don't make a single thing that makes you walk out of the theater thinking you just saw a good movie. I and others I know don't go to movies to come out depressed over the insane violence.We see enough of that in the news.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13: 3/10: Let us forget for a moment that Assault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a classic action movie. Taken completely on its own merits Assault is a debacle. Lets start with the Rio Bravo style scenario. About a dozen people are trapped in a decaying police station in Detroit (If the Detroit location is giving you Robocop warm and fuzzies stop right now. It could have easily said Topeka in the opening credits and nothing would have changed. In fact the last bit in the forest would have made more sense.) Surrounding them are our bad guys; corrupt cops.Now I know what your thinking. Corrupt cops? Were the Nazis and drug cartels busy that weekend? Of course these are no ordinary cops. These guys are right of the cover of the latest Tom Clancy video game. Yup we have body armor; helicopters; laser sights; night vision goggles the works. So we have thirty S.W.A.T. members/Special Forces armed to the teeth verses 4 cops (drunk mind you it's new years eve), 2 girls in party dresses and half a dozen criminals. So how do our heroes defend themselves? Truth is they can't. They all should be dead within ten minutes tops. (Not to mention the characters inside have an annoying habit of walking past the windows.) Now an illogical scenario is no reason to completely pan a movie esp. a B style action film. However with the exception of Laurence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke all the other characters seemed to be comic relief. (At least I hope they were) While Ja-Rules and Leguizamo's characters are bad enough. It's Aisha Hind's minstrel show that takes the cake. Rarely has a more stereotypical African American character appeared on the modern screen. Her performance resembles a frat boy in blackface and drag acting ghetto. In the original Assault a gang member takes over an Ice-Cream truck and drives around the neighborhood shooting little girls in the head. I have had an irrational fear of ice-cream trucks ever since. After this Assault I have a perfectly rational fear of remakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Quality Remake Of An Unmissable Low-Budget Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On a snowy New Year's Eve in Detroit, the staff at an old police station are celebrating the last night before it is decommissioned when a prison bus carrying a powerful mobster is forced to stop there. Unfortunately, a team of crooked cops are out to silence him and will stop at nothing to storm the station and kill everyone inside ...It's very pleasant that somebody wanted to remake John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13, for my money the best low-budget seventies cop thriller, and whilst this version isn't nearly as good, it's still an extremely enjoyable movie. It has several good things going for it; the snowstorm setting is great, there's an excellent score by Graeme Revell (and a nifty Assault rap by KRS-1) and it has the gritty urban feel of the original. Most importantly, James DeMonaco's script strikes the right balance between retaining the original idea and taking it in different directions - this movie takes out the murdered girl subplot, replaces the ganglords with corrupt policeman whose careers are at stake, throws in a traitor-in-the-midst question and extends the action outside the police station for the finale. This is all good stuff - remakes should always be different, otherwise what's the point ? The cast are terrific - Fishburne particularly shines in the choice role of gangster Bishop (the name of the heroic cop in the original), but DeMatteo, Leguizamo and rapper Rule are all very good, and it's nice to see old pro Dennehy (who's played more cops than I've had hot dinners) still at the top of his game. There are some things I don't like in here - the photography wavers between good and stupid (especially in an unnecessary prologue), Byrne's character is a bit of a bland stock-villain and the action could use some trimming, but how can I complain about anyone remaking the work of the greatest and most underrated filmmaker of all time ?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a snowstorm hits the soon to be defunct police station precinct 13, Sergeant Roenick is perturbed to take delivery of a bus load of crooks, one of which is gang-lord Marion Bishop. Not longer after the crooks are locked down in their cells, the precinct comes under siege from a gang of heavily armed assailants. With just a couple of colleagues for help, Roenick must make some very big decisions if they are to survive the night.I wish to put on record my love and admiration for John Carpenter's original Assault On Precinct 13 feature film, in fact for the record I'm a John Carpenter acolyte. I also wish to say that I think myself fortunate that I can separate a remake from the original offering, I am in short, a conscientious purveyor of objectivity. Remakes are never an easy thing, and many fail to improve on the film they are re-imaging, it's especially difficult to update a cult classic film such as this one, and The Italian Job for examples, but when viewed separately, and on its own terms, Jean-Francois' Assault On Precinct 13, is a fine no brain popcorn effort. Yes it's nowhere near close to the grimness that was brilliantly evident in Carpenter's wonderful film, but as a cop and crooks exercise, it delivers fine set pieces, gun play abound, and a terrific cast eager to enjoy the ride for our personal entertainment. Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, Gabriel Byrne, Brian Dennehy, John Leguizamo, Ja Rule, Maria Bello and Drea de Matteo, all are given intriguing characters with something to add to the bubbling thriller stew.Personally I feel that this picture is harshly treated, because as remakes go it does entertain those willing to judge it for what it is. It's not asking people to forget the original, it's merely being popcorn fodder for the suitably inclined and it's actually great fun. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the original !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie about one year ago. My first thought appeared before playing the movie and it was that the movie it's gonna be a bad remake, non-comparable to the original. My second thought appeared after a short time from the beginning and it was that the movie is kind of boring, so I thought I was right... it's a bad remake... But I told my self "What the hell, I started watching, let's see it till it ends !" So I continued watching it. ...What can I say... my final thought appeared after the movie ended and it was that I was right about something... it wasn't comparable with the original. It was much, much better. I like Carpenter's movies, especially because most of them are kind of bizarre. "Assault On Precinct 13" was one of them, somehow. I liked it a lot. I won't talk about the difference of effects between the movies, because it isn't fair. Since 1976 till 2005 many things changed. The difference between those two movies that I want to point is that the new one had a very logical and a very well written scenario. It wasn't kind of chaotic like the old one was. The cast of characters was made with good and well known actors and it was completed by Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne which proved once again that they really ARE actors. I'm disappointed that the new one is not better seen in statistics than the old one. My opinion is that it's much better than the old one.So, I advice anyone who reads this post... Watch the 2005's "Assault on Precinct 13". It worths all the money !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm sure a lot of guys will love this movie. The only woman who shows any "balls" (unfortunate pun regretted) is made to look, talk, and seem like a guy, the other 2 women are portrayed either as sexual objects with one thing on their mind- sex / being sexy, with sex as their only attribute and skill (Iris) - or as freaked out pretty little princesses who's neurosis negates any strength and professional authority they had before all hell broke lose (Doc). The only strength Iris has in the end is the result of some advice from a big strong man. Besides my negative gut reaction as a feminist, I have to give the camera work props- and Ethan Hawke is great in the very first scene. After that his performance loses steam. Empty entertainment for a brain that wants to take it easy. At least the film skims the subject of the duality of good/bad in the criminal mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A competent action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will fess up now and admit that I have not seen either John Carpenter's original production of Assault On Precinct 13, nor Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo, upon which both are based. Carpenter himself has, in a manner of speaking, remade his Assault On Precinct 13 with Ghosts Of Mars, so there is a small basis for comparison. Where Ghosts Of Mars demonstrated that Carpenter knows how to film a tense and powerful film, this update of Assault On Precinct 13 is far from tense. Truth be told, it is so straightforward that observant viewers will pick all of the so-called plot twists a mile off. Fortunately, it has a good stock of saving graces that keep it from being a write-off. Given that this is the first English language film for Jean-François Richet, it shows a fair bit of promise. It also shows once again that European directors are capable of making an interesting film where American, Australian, or even British directors will not.The plot of both Assaults On Precinct 13, to a large extent Ghosts Of Mars, and I will assume Rio Bravo, are basically alike. It is in the details where these films showing two small forces that are polar opposites against a larger, better-organised opponent make their mark. In the case of Assault On Precinct 13 circa 2005, the film tries to distinguish itself by adding a lot of details where its predecessor reputedly kept things short, sharp, and to the point. The real question is whether it works. Sometimes it does, and does so well, but there are also a few times when it really does not. A good example of when the new Assault On Precinct 13 does not work is when Brian Dennehy, one of the few actors in this remake who is old enough to have been in the original (he was not - his asking price was probably too high at the time), conveniently announces he has found a way out of the precinct via the basement. This deus ex machina not only deflates the tension of the ending a lot, it retroactively deflates the tension of the rest of the film.On the positive side, director Jean-François Richet is not shy about showing the consequences of violent actions. On two occasions in the film, characters are shot in the head. The resulting shots with the camera zooming away from faces that have a massive hole in the upper middle are enough to burn the film permanently on your retina or memory. The problem there is that they also leave one wishing the rest of the film could have excelled like those shots. Ethan Hawke struck me as the worst possible choice for a lead in this project, but he portrays the main hero with such an excellent arc that it is easy to forgive the myriad of turkeys he has before appeared in, at least for a hundred and nine minutes. Lawrence Fishburne is just barely young enough to have not been suitable for the original Assault, but the renegade prime target for the new besiegers is a role he slips into so comfortably, you will think he was born to play it. Gabriel Byrne is somewhat weak in his role as the evil leader, but this can be blamed on his appalling lack of screen time. When he is given the chance to speak, he is very good at holding one's attention.I have tried to remain objective so far, but the choice of music in the end credits could not have been worse. To call one half of the end credit roll annoying is understating things. Thankfully, Graeme Revell does such an awesome job of countering this with a tight event-based score that it is almost enough to forgive him for involving himself with turkeys like Street Fighter. It is his music that makes the Mexican standoff scene a little over halfway through the film work. Another aspect that makes the film work is the cinematography. While there are rarely more than two heads in a frame, camera motion is used correctly for a change in order to increase the tension. The dolly focus shot a third of the way into the film puts one directly into Roenick's boots to a far greater extent than a thousand shaky-cam POV shots ever could. I do not think I will ever run out of ways to express how superior European directors are because of the general lack of shaky-cam in their work. The fact that no shot in the film is zoomed in too close to actually see how the focus of the shot is interacting with others also helps a lot. What we have here, therefore, is a competently-executed action film the likes of which we have not seen since the late 1980s.This is not enough to make Assault On Precinct 13 circa 2005 a classic, but it is enough for me to give it a seven out of ten. If the director manages to keep the same artistic sensibility he displayed on this film for the rest of his career, there is no telling how far he could go.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first John Carpenter's Remake that turns alright.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a remake from the 1976 Cult Classic film directed by John Carpenter (Halloween, The Fog, The Thing-1982). Which it had a simple story. The film is about an old police precinct, division 13. Which it is the last day that precinct would be open for public before it relocated into a new police station. A outraged father murdered one of the most dangerous gangs of L.A., after one of these gang members murdered the girl's father in cold blood. Then the father finds himself alone and sacred, he takes refuge on that police station that is almost practically empty. Then these dangerous gang decides to stage a siege at that police station. Which Police Officers, Civilians and Criminals have no choice to help each other to save themselves.The Remake has the same setting but instead of Street Gangs, this time is Corrupted Police Officers attacking the nearly abandon police station. The Story of the remake is about a disgrace Detroit Police Officer (Ethan Hawke) is been assign to stay for the night with an sexy secretary (Drea de Matteo) and old veteran officer (Brian Dennehy) for the last night at the police station for New Year's Eve before it shut down for the next day.A Gangster (Laurence Fishburne) is been caught by the police and sent to prison but since the bug is caught on a bad winter storm. The gangster, three other criminals (John Leguizamo, Ja Rule &amp; Aisha Hands) and two police officers (Dorian Harewood &amp; Kim Coates) decide to stay for the night at the police station. A corrupt police officer (Gabriel Byrne) and his men decide to set a attack at the old precinct to murder the infamous gangster. Because the gangster knows the corrupt officer, that gangster could testify the corrupt officer and his men in court. Also by putting these corrupted officers to jail for life. But these corrupter would do anything to kill the gangster, other criminals and especially the police officers trapped in Precient 13.This is a fast paced remake of the original. violent 1976 film. The violence in the remake is extremely brutal and it has bad language. But the remake unlike the somewhat slow paced original. This remake has certain flaws like the film takes place in Detroit, Does Detroit really has a forest in the middle of the bad streets of that city ? Sure the film is somehow lacking in conviction. But what helps ease the flaws is the strong performances by the cast-especially by Hawke, Fishburne and Dennehy. The film has a solid script by James DeMonaco, who wrote the underrated cop thriller-The Negotiator. Carpenter is not involved with this remake. Carpenter got involved with the remake of The Fog instead. Which the Fog remake will be released in the fall of 2005.The remake is directed Jean Francois Richet. Which he is a famous stylish film director from France. Richet shows some style in this film with good camera shots and terrific cinematography by Robert Gantz (Mindhunters). Also the action sequences are good. The remake isn't a Hit at the Box Office (Like the original film). But like the original film, the remake will get a cult following. DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong- Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS 5.1 Surround Sound). DVD has an amusing commentary track by the director:Richet, Screenwriter:DeManaco and Producer:Jeffery Silver. DVD also has Deleted Scenes with optional commentary by the director and five featurettes. Fans of the Original won't be disappointed with the remake. The remake is certainly worth a look. Watch for the occasional laughable dialogue that seems out of place with this film. This remake is destined to be a cult classic. Just forget logic and enjoy this action-thriller. Super 35.

		<shortDescription>Okay movie for a gun enthusiast.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is only one thing that made an impression on me in this movie: Gun!! I was watching tonight and thought "I wish there are gun manufacturer's Logos popping up every time guns come into a scene": They all did look cool and sounded interesting. The special force guys' (SWAT or whatever you want to call them) gears looked cool too. All the other human characters just felt really flat and generic. Ethan was okay. Morpheus was Morpheus. Girls looked pretty in a dress and mini-skirt (minus one lady in the movie). Ja-rule?uh...why is he in the movie? The plot is nothing you want to write home about. It's a brainless and interestingly intriguing hardware movie. It actually does remind me of some of those mindless Japanimation with no plot but some cool scenes and sequences with hardware (guns, vehicles, etc). However, I must say that this movie is better than those Japanimation featuring guns and mini-skirted girls with no plot.I give 6 out of 10. Maybe 7 if I am drunk.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Myself as a lover as cop action movies thought this movie was good however it could have been better. The cast was good and Ethan Hawke made his comeback role after Training Day after corrupt cop movies. Following was Laurence Fishburne, JA Rule (not that big in movies but still a big name), John Leguizamo who had a horrible part in this movie and did a horrible job acting it and two hot chicks, Maria Bello and Drea De Matteo. The action sequences could have been a bit more intriguing and the plot wasn't all that great. The whole idea about the cops and criminals who team up to fight corruption and then like all happy endings wind up helping each out at the end is what interests me in this movie. And if you couldn't figure out by a half an hour into the movie who was behind the assaults then I feel sorry for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Acting by Surrounding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is easy to describe. It is a zombie movie. Carpenter's world is one in which everyone is besieged by demons. It is only a matter of what shape the refuge takes. So he seamlessly maps strong movie situations to this form. And it is Carpenter's vision that is extended a bit here.So start with this being a zombie movie, except the zombies are faceless except for their controllers who we don't really encounter until the end. Endings are always problematic in zombie movies because audiences see their own desperate barricade and want to have some hope of escape. But the situation only works dramatically if there is no escape.That's the form, and by itself it is rather uninteresting. What is interesting is how this filmmaker has decided to turn it into an actor-centric project. This is a somewhat interesting turn because the setup demands that the movie be situation-centric. Oh, you usually have the "Ship of Fools" business about characters bumping up against each other, "discovering" or redeeming themselves.And that's here, and somewhat heavily developed as the funk of our hero is explained in full detail, and at the same time giving us the textbook fast start.But from the first scene you know that what you are going to get here is actors doing actorly things. All the oomph in this is centered on that. The situation is just a familiar wrapper that is used to define bounds for us, an easy to read set of character fences that define zones in which these actors are permitted to roam.They chose serious actors of a certain type. Everyone here comes from that philosophy of acting that is perhaps the most noble: no reliance on personality, no recourse to referencing other performances (the main hazard when doing remakes) and no cheating. What you get here is honest shaping.It isn't the kind of acting I usually celebrate in my comments. I like the intellectual presentation where the actor is telling us something about the process of creating the character when she is. This is something different. Hawke, Bello, Fishburn, Burn, even Denehy in his smiling way. These are all that type who will show up and want to discover a person, who want to shape a person from the constraints they find in what is written and what they discover about their fellow adventurers.For each of them, it is a process not much unlike the barricade, the assault and the escape into a full person that the larger container sketches here. It isn't a great movie, and perhaps not the best example of this ? usually you find this in some dreary tragedy. The excesses of "Mystic River" were along these lines.But if you decide you want something more old fashioned in terms of cinematic conventions and acting, this isn't a bad bet.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

I wish the entire movie was as gritty and real as the intro.In order to enjoy some movies, a lot can be forgiven,(hand guns with 60 shots, hero's with super human powers, all women are gorgeous AND half naked) but Puuuuleeese this "Assault On My Intelligence 13" is so far fetched that I'm surprised the cast showed up for a second day of filming.Firstly, how did these guys get to be cops? Based on stupidity I guess. How do the main female characters justify being half naked in the middle of winter in Detroit or wherever the heck they are. As a matter of fact no character reacts to the elements whatsoever in this movie. No windows, no electricity(which miraculously returns unexplained)during the storm of the century and they are all comfy as bugs in a rug. What technology exists which disables all cell phones, radios, and brain function. This must be the same power which causes Maria Bella to walk from her disabled car knee deep in snow with no coat and hardly any dress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You ever hear someone tell you that the original was better? Well.... that's because it was.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, anyway, the movie starts and it's something you've seen a couple of times before, i.e. the drug bust gone bad. Granted, Ethan Hawke gives a great performance in this scene. Picture Quentin Tarantino on a Pez bender, sporting a shaved head and gabbing about some great movie that only screened for a week in a Burmese brothel and that's exactly what you have here. The entire beginning sequence of the film reminded me of Narc for a reason that I can't quite grasp but the intensity of Narc's beginning is sorely missing from this. I kind of felt like the director was going for exactly that same kind of slam bang beginning but it felt slightly forced and it didn't get my blood pumping the way the movie wanted it to. And that same feeling ran through the rest of the movie for me. I felt like I was supposed to be charged up and believe me, I was ready and willing to go along for the ride, willing to let myself get carried away by some B-grade action and violence but it just never happened.The movie has better than average cinematography, with all the scenes well lit and most of them cast in a bluish tone that complements the snowy setting very well. The director does pull off some interesting camera tricks. One in particular where Ethan Hawke is washing his face in the bathroom was really subtle yet cool. Of course, a couple of the action scenes suffer from being almost incomprehensible, edited to the point that I'm glad that I'm not susceptible to seizures or I would've been in the hospital right now with someone's wallet clamped between my teeth. Since when did action scenes have to be edited with a food processor? All in all, I think that this guy has a good eye and he may be worth looking out for in the future when he gets a really good project in his hands but this movie is more or less a file to sharpen his creative nails on.The performances are what you'd expect but in some cases I was disappointed. The moments of sudden violence were nice. I liked that characters were taken out with little remorse but then again, it didn't matter because I wasn't really too crazy about most of them anyway. I have no problem telling you that when Ja Rule got taken out, me and my friends clapped loudly and cheered, not giving a damn that he was in the audience also. His character sucked and get this, his deal is that he refers to himself in the third person. (Ex. "Smiley says good morning. Smiley don't play that. Smiley's not only goan tear his nuts off, he goan chew on dem mahfahs.") Wow, great character trait. I didn't give a Christ about his character at all. John Leguizamo plays pretty much the same guy he played in Spun except Spun contained the better, more inspired version of motor mouthed drug addict he plays. Hawke is probably the best thing about this movie. His scenes with Maria Bello were pretty good and Fishburne and Hawke deliver when they're together but I must have been a little spoiled by Training Day because the repartee between Denzel "Player to Player, Pimp to Pimp" Washington and Hawke was all I could wish for while watching this. Brian Dennehy was good and I'd have to say that Drea de Matteo was pretty good also. Maria Bello is pretty hot and her character's arc surprised me.What I really liked about the original was the spooky feeling that it had. The enemies were a faceless, seemingly limitless horde that stood in the shadows watching the building. The music also gave the movie that Michael Myers feeling but then again, we're talking John Carpenter. In the remake, you know exactly who the bad guys are and they're just not that interesting. I'm not going to blame Gabriel Byrne as it seemed to me that he just wasn't given enough to work with. And you'd think that the rest of the bad guys with all of their Rainbow Six equipment would've been less inept but in these kinds of movies, it's almost a requirement.I will give credit to the film makers for making a movie that stayed true to the source and thankfully it wasn't a carbon copy of the original. I think that switching the villains from being gang members to cops was an inspired touch in a way but like I said before, they just weren't interesting. I just couldn't help but feel like I had seen this all before and done better. Hawke and Fishburne do bring the material up in quality with their mere presence. The supporting characters, love 'em or hate 'em, help and hamper the movie equally. The story isn't anything spectacular and never really surprising. If you can't tell who the rat in the movie is early on, I'd be surprised.By the way, this is coming from someone who just saw the original for the first time a year and a half ago. While I'm not an obsessed fan of the original, I have to say that in comparison to Carpenter's classic, this is the perfect case of less being more. Standing on its own, I'd still say the movie was just so-so.RATING **1/2 out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I didn't know what to expect going into the movie, but I was quite disappointed. Good actors and what seemed to be a good plot turned out to just be OK. I enjoyed Training Day and expected to enjoy this as well. The movie isn't a total bust, but I'd wait and rent it if I were you. Warning.. if you don't like seeing rifle head shots, this movie isn't for you. Lots of blood and lots of casualties. The movie was too confined and basically only took place in one location which in my opinion makes the movie dull. As a movie buff, I knew the ending 20 minutes into it and it didn't leave much to the imagination. All in all just an OK movie, and I won't be recommending it to anyone. I give it a rating of 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

The cast, Maria Bello, Laurence Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Gabriel Burne, John Leguizamo and Drea De Matteo are all great actors but even they couldn't save this film. It was just wrong.

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first Carpenter remake released in 05, the year of the Carpenter remakes. Amazingly this isn't a shot for shot remake but actually a reasonable attempt at something slightly different. Must give kudos to the script writer/s for trying a new angle with the plot to add a touch of originality.Its pretty much the same type of film as before accept this time the cops and crooks holed up within Precinct 13 are against crooked cops who want one of the convicts inside dead. Nice twist.You don't really expect that to be honest, I just expected the same old thing with a load of gang thugs but this adds a new dimension. The fact its a whole team of crooked cops led by the nasty Byrne is really good. Bryne merely stands around and sneers a lot ordering his men to do stuff, but his presence really boosts the bad guys, faceless no more.The good guys are now of course a group of big names but the choices are OK. Hawke is the Sgt in charge of the station and Dennehy is the clichéd fat old moustached vet cop, whilst Fishburne leads the bad guys with Leguizamo doing another good twitchy gun nut.On one hand this is a fun film, plenty of decent action, pretty violent, good visuals and good performances from the main leads. On the other hand it does get silly in places, very predictable of course and feels like they are trying too hard. I did wonder if they were having a swearing competition throughout, how many times can you say 'f*ck'!?, as if that will make the film better saying it a hundred times.The main issue is the simple plot point of a small group of convicts and beat cops up against a crack team of elite cops. Not just dumbass thugs but fully suited special ops type guys, yet they can't seem to crack this band of misfits, all of them end up getting killed! so much for elite cops huh.This is a fairly decent action romp I can't deny, stupid in places and with a slightly lame finale but its fun to watch. A slightly different beast to the original which is good but at the same time you lose the mystery and suspense of the original. The unknown lurking shadows in the bushes of the originals bad guys.There is a lot of stuff which has been tossed in here to flesh the whole thing out a bit more. Trying to make the film feel more of a serious Hollywood action thriller but its all pointless and not required, the beginning sequence especially. Think of this as a venture into 'Die Hard 2' territory, snow included. 6/10</fullReview>

A storm forces a police bus carrying a criminal named Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), Beck (John Leguizamo), a girl(Aisha Hinds) and Smiley (Ja Rule) to dump them off.Naturally, Bishop's men will try to break him out and we are witness to some real action.

		<shortDescription>Adequate Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lacking the slightly surreal and spooky touch of John Carpenter, this remake of his tense psychological horror movie - which owed a great deal to Hitchcock's 'The Birds' - offers a more formulaic presentation.Unlike Carpenter's anonymous assassins, who stalk and kill without any apparently logical motive (like birds, or in his case, more aptly - zombies) we are soon introduced to the besiegers and their motive.This remake borrows a number of plot-threads from the original, when there was really no need. And one can't help but feel that the similarity has more to do with lack of imagination than 'homage' to an earlier work. Once again we have a Precinct 13 that is apparently closing down. This time it's New Year's Eve, decanting a tincture of 'Die Hard 2' into the prescription. Also again, a bus of bad guys takes refuge there for the night. Carpenter made one of them ill, here they just shelter from a snowstorm.Roles are reversed. Now, a white cop - played by Ethan Hawke - runs the show. And the criminal turned deputy is a black guy played by the ever reliable Larry Fishburne who arrives on the bus (and hasn't he piled on the pounds?). Fishburne's character has been cutting crooked deals with cops and now means to grass 'em up in order to save his own skin. The head of the bent cops is played by excellent Gabriel Byrne, and he means to silence him come what may.So; a further - and rather improbable - twist to the story is that the attackers are police.The movie takes forever to get started. And this was a complaint I had about the original. To be fair; Carpenter had more threads to tie-in, including a lost father and daughter, and an itinerant ice-cream man all deleted from this remake. Frankly; the dithering preamble intended to fill-out its characters before the bus arrives gets plain boring at times. There is some very clichéd commentary and evaluation. I often found myself willing it on before the real action started. Brian Dehenny is always reliable, but here his role looks contrived. And, in truth, he's really just included as a trusted-workmate-turned-traitor character, and sleep-walks his part with tiresome bigoted comments.When the action finally kicks-off, the movie comes into its own. There is plenty of tension throughout. The siege is less one-sided than the original as regards weapons, and is more of a regular shoot-out than Carpenter's creepy and enigmatic emphasis on silenced firearms. The two directorial styles are well contrasted.The defenders set fire to the station (something I would have done in the original) and 'escape' down the drain. But it's evident that they've only gone a couple of hundred yards underground and must still be in enemy territory when they surface. Which they are. When caught, we have the usual clichéd explanations and ceremony instead of just killing outright, thus allowing the goodies to steal an advantage. Dr Evil's son griped about this kind of pantomime in - I think - 'The Spy Who Shagged Me'.The baddies all get their come-uppance. Fishburne's character wanders off clutching a bullet wound. And law 'n' order are restored.It's an adequate and slick little thriller with a cast of competent and recognisable leads. They act well, and the script mostly passes muster. Music, sound-score, cinematography and editing are all likewise competent. And that said; it has no stand-out qualities to remember. It's like so many others: a formula thriller.Just compare the theme and incidental 'musak' of this remake with the sly, unnerving soundtrack which Carpenter himself composed for his original. No contest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not the original, but a solid 98 minutes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has nowhere near the same level of tension as Carpenter's(just to clear things up, for those of you who haven't read my review of that, I have not seen Rio Bravo, which I understand that both are based upon), but I don't get the impression that that was what they were going for. Why try to beat the man at his own game? Instead, they went in a different direction, and it works. Some scenes and bits from the '76 version are redone or referenced, and it's not bad. The basic concept is also reused, but beyond that, they rewrote it almost entirely. More time is spent on characters in this one, and they are all well-written, credible and interesting. Leguizamo is(and, it seems, has) an awful lot of fun in this. The acting in general is great(perhaps not for Ja, but... was anyone expecting more of him in this kind of thing?). The dialog is almost entirely invariably(save for a little bit of repetitive material) excellent, with many cool and clever lines. The action is marvelous, at times breaking into being purely awesome. It's violent and graphic, and rather immensely entertaining. The tone is gritty. The plot develops nicely throughout. The pacing is good. Realism is fairly high. Richet seems to "get" the environment. Effects are exceptionally well-done. The music is fitting, and marvelous, rap and the like. Editing and cinematography are masterful and effective. The hand-held is a very positive surprise. There is a continued stream of language, much of which is strong. The DVD holds well-done featurettes going into detail about aspects such as stunts, guns and set design, deleted scenes with words by Jean-Francois, and a commentary track(which makes for an enjoyable and informational listen), as well. John Carpenter's film is better, in my opinion... but they are certainly both well worth watching. I recommend this to fans of the genres and the people involved in making it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Carpenter's original "Assualt on Precinct 13" was a story about mindless gang violence. In the remake the assault towards the closing down police department is made from entirely different cause, or it could have be said, that the writes just decided to write a bit bigger plot around this film.Now the premises of the settings here are quite similar to the original, but this time the people get trapped in the police department because of a snow storm. There also is a bigger cast and things that were surprising in the original are removed mainly because of the change of the three things: weather, bigger cast and the reason of the attack.As remake go, "Assault on Precint 13" is pretty well done one, it even manages to stand out a bit from its predecessor, but it never actually manages to stand as tall as the original, as far as the mood and atmosphere goes. In fact, the remake manages to be more conventional and predictable in every way. But still, it's not a bad movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Forget the original, and watch this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Jean-François Richet gives us a modern update to John Carpenter's original film, which besides similar plots and names, really have nothing in common.Laurence Fishburne dominates the screen as a cop killer, Marion Bishop, who is arrested and put on a bus to go to a prison, but when the bus almost breaks down because of a New Years Eve blizzard, they are forced to stay at Precinct 13, which is closing down in a couple of days and only has 3 officers working the shift. Those three officers are Sgt. Joe Roenick, who has a troubled past (played nicely by Ethan Hawke, who also dominates the screen.) Sgt. Jasper O'Shea, who is retiring the next day, (very well played by Brian Dennehy.) Also, a very hot officer, Iris Ferry (played by Drea de Matteo.) A civilian with the officers is Roenick's therapist, Dr. Alex Sabian (who had some major on and off acting moments by Maria Bello) to talk about Roenick's dark past.Also, there are 3 other prisoners on the bus with Bishop played named Beck (played by John Leguizamo, who has some major on and off moments of acting in this.) Smiley (horribly played by Ja Rule) who is really the weakest link in this movie. Also, there is Anna (another on and off performance by Aisha Hinds.) But when corrupt cops try to break in to the precinct in order to execute Bishop because they have a corrupt deal with him and don't want him talking, Sgt. Roenick must arm the prisoners to survive the night.This movie was entertaining for the most part, but only a 7 out of 10 because of two major reasons. The first reason is all the prisoners acting (besides Fishburne) are very stereotyped and have horrible acting skills that really brought it down to an 8/10. Also, there are a lot of things in the movie that doesn't make sense (all I can think of contain spoilers so I can't say.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Assault on a Snowy Night</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You came in here looking for a good action film, a nice thriller with surprise elements, generic and non disappointing. Choose this! Filmed upon a dark precinct, where inmates are held through a snowy, hard night, one will immediately plunge into his/her warm blanket and admire the action packed scenery in between the snow paradise, which brings a cool aura into the film. Gives you no time to breath, and presents the characters quite well in matter of seconds. The movie is temperamental and excellently filmed. I was excited and praising for the good end on Ethan's Hawke character, and curled myself on tension while his team fought to sell their lives and their objectives at high prices. "Assault on Precinct 13", by Jean-Françoise Ricochet is a very decent remake, moderated and changed a little to apply to the filming principles of this action packed era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found this to be a movie well done. Finally an action film that is a little more realistic, where the special effects aren't over the top and where they serve a purpose in the plot, and not a movie which is simply a vehicle for an endless array of ridiculous never ending stunts. The characters are well developed, so that we can actually care what happens to them. And most importantly, this movie has tons of tension and is rather unpredictable, which makes it very, very enjoyable. The tension comes mainly from the script, and depends largely on some very good acting of almost all involved (Lawrence Fishburne is absolutely great in his role, although his character is rather simplistic, he manages to create a memorable persona and definitely steals every scene he is in, unlike Ethan Hawke).All in all, a very good thriller, highly recommended, but not for the faint of heart...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having not seen the original I cannot compare this movie to it's predecessor as others have (With bad results I must say) so I am just going to have to wing it. The movie follows Sgt. Jake Roenick(Hawke) on New Years Eve. It is his last day on the force and the last day in his police precinct as it is about to be torn down. Him and two other employees are spending the rest of the night there when in the middle of a snowstorm they get a call to house a notorious murderer (Fishburne)as his prison bus gets caught in a blizzard. Afterwards an unknown enemy comes to the police precinct to do who knows what to it and after all the terrorist renegades arrive it is all guns blazing.The action is the standing point in this film. Memorable scenes are abound and special effects are expertly crafted. The acting can be sub par as some of the actors fail to express fear as much as they should. Twists are abound. The movie is very gripping and waiting for the next scene has anticipation. Near the end of the movie some of the scenes may get a little aggravating as the movie tends to repeat scenes in a different way. The ending could be better and I wish their was more realism.(The terrorists tend to die fairly easily from these people which only 3 of them have any real combat experience.) For the conclusion I will give this movie a solid B+. Definitely recommended for those who have not seen the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Surprise to me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After watching Assault on Precinct 13, I was really surprised at how much I really did enjoy watching it. When my husband brought it home from the video store, I groaned. All I could think of was the last movie that I sat through with Ethan Hawke in it, Training Day, and that is was a remake. Those two factors made me wonder if I was going to waste another hour and half of my life. When the movie was over, I was pleasantly surprised! I had just found another movie to add to our DVD wish list and a good movie to recommend to friends.The characters in the movie are wonderfully written and terrifically portrayed by delightful cast chosen to be in this film. Ethan Hawke seems to put his heart and soul into his character, a reclusive cop who, after losing 2 partners in a sting gone wrong, hides himself, away from responsibility, in a precinct running out of time. Laurence Fishburne plays a wonderful character based seemingly solely on self preservation. He'll do anything to make sure that he gets out of the situation as cleanly as possible and keeps all others at bay from getting too close.The other characters really help support the movie and keep it going at a steady pace. Forced to do something that they would probably not do to try and get all of their friends and "family" (anyone who has ever known or been related to someone in the law enforcement field knows what I'm talking about with the family comment) out of this sad situation alive. The biggest turning point in this movie (and possibly my favorite plot line) is the fact that Hawke's character and Bello's (whom is quickly becoming a favorite actress of mine) character start off by having this mutual dissension for one another ? he thinks he doesn't need therapy ? she thinks he needs to get off his butt, quit blaming himself for things that happened in the past, and become the cop that she knows he can be again. Throughout the movie, he learns what she's talking about and she learns that there's more to life and making it your own. After Byrne's character catches her trying to escape and questions her about how many are inside, she holds her own and ends up being murdered, I was quite sad it was like she understood exactly what Hawke's character was going through.I also really appreciate the fact that this movie isn't just a serious dark film. There are plenty comedic relief moments from the entire cast. I absolutely love Brian Dennehy as he's just a very versatile actor. I think John Leguizamo is a very under-rated actor and should be considered for more serious roles. Drea de Matteo and Maria Bello are two very up and coming actresses and I look forward to seeing them in more films. I expect that they, out of the entire cast, are the two that are going to benefit most from this film as they were excellent in the portrayal of their characters. Most of all, this film has given me reason to re-evaluate other Ethan Hawke films, which once I've decided that I don't care for an actor/actress, is something that I don't normally do.All in all I feel this is a great movie and will hopefully become a favorite among many.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) is a burnt out X undercover narcotics officer with a painful past. A few years back...while involved in an undercover sting, things went horribly wrong; leading to the death of 2 of his team officers.Fast forward a few years later to New Years Eve and Jake now has a low stress level desk job at soon to be defunct "Precinct 13". He drinks and pops pills on the job in an apparent attempt to forget the memories of that horrible day and of his fallen comrades.This is the last night of operation at "Precinct 13", as it will close after New Years and the remaining officers are to be transferred to a newly built and bigger precinct across town.A blizzard is raging, and in an attempt to transfer some prisoners to another locale, the harsh weather conditions force some local officers driving a prisoner transport bus to make a pit stop at "Precinct 13" until the weather clears up. Along with 3 other lowly criminals comes Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) a high profile gangsta just busted for a cop killing.There are only 4 people at "Precinct 13" when the bus arrives. Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), soon-to-be retired Officer Jasper ( Brian Dennehy), Officer Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo), &amp; police physcologist Dr Alex Sabian (Maria Bello) who was detoured from an earlier visit by the snow.Soon...all the officers find themselves fighting for their lives as assassins stake out the building from outside and try to weasel their way in. At first it is assumed that they are Bishops henchmen, looking to free him and help him escape. This quickly proves not to be the case, and the officers AND the prisoners find themselves working together to fight off the deadly intruders."Assault on Precinct 13" is a formulaic action movie, but now a days, aren't all action movies that way? The film flows nicely, has some pretty intense shoot-outs, and some nice blood and gore to top it off. Hawke's and Bello's performances are the stand-outs, but they are accompanied by a well rounded cast of good actors.All in all, "Assault on Precinct 13" is a pretty decent and entertaining shoot-em up action flick. If you enjoy films of this nature, this one is worth at least a rental.</fullReview>

Good tension and and a large body count all add to the excitement.Set in a police station at Christmas, snowed in and holding a number of violent criminals,things turn from bad to worse when a group of mysterious terrorists turn up with their own agenda.Should everyone hole up and sit tight or make a break for freedom, the action and surprises keep you on the edge of your seat.

		<fullReview>A notorious gangster by the name of Marion Bishop (Lawrence Fishburne) has been arrested and is being transported to prison when the weather causes his bus to have to drop him and his fellow prisoners off at precinct 13. The overnight stay gets exciting when a group of highly trained masked gunmen bombard precinct 13. Soon you are clued in that the masked gunmen are actually police officers out to kill Marion Bishop to prevent him from testifying against them in court. Suddenly, the top officer at precinct 13 has to make a critical decision: A.) arm the prisoners at precinct 13 to prevent the onslaught of corrupt police officers and thereby give yourself a chance to survive the night or B.) don't arm the prisoners and face certain death.The story was O.K. I think I, as well as any others that watched this, really just watched it for the action and the strategizing. The only intriguing factor about this movie was the strategizing and what move each side would make next. If that element was stripped away, then it would have been complete senseless violence and mildly amusing dialogue. It certainly was star studded with Fishburne, Ethan Hawke, Brian Dennehy, Gabriel Byrne (from "The Usual Suspects"), John Leguizamo, and others, but don't let the cast fool you.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While many action films these days are comprised of bad story lines, worthless characters, bad actors, and too much cgi; Assault on Precinct 13 is not. A remake of John Carpenter's classic flick, the new adaptation takes on the basic concept and aims for an updated fun new perspective. Ethan Hawke is a fantastic (and underrated) actor who plays a police sergeant addicted to pain killers with a troubled past. While keeping everyone in line during the hectic night of snipers and explosions he must grow as a person. Very well portrayed. Laurence Fishburne was great to watch no question but he could have had more dialog to play with. At times it was like watching a caged Lion, a great actor with only little bits to work with. You can't deny that watching Ethan and Fishburne pairing up to take on bad guys isn't enjoyable. Sure there are plenty of generic moments throughout the film but action flicks these days are sloppy and lack any depth whatsoever. Assault on Precinct 13 rises above this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There comes a time when a movie is released and after you watch it you'll say to yourself "I'm glad I watched it." "Assault on Precint 13," the loose remake to the 1976 John Carpenter film of the same name is exactly this type of movie. The direction was solid, the performances were decent to above average. There are times throughout this film where the cinematography is very good, thus enhancing the effect of certain scenes.Perhaps the two things that really save this movie is Laurence Fishburne's great performance and the plot of the film. I think it's interesting how an action movie is set in one particular place especially in a police precinct of all places. Fishburne's subtle, yet powerful performance make this movie more than just another action flick: it makes it an action flick with style.Check this one out whenever it comes on television or rent it if you can.

		<shortDescription>A good action film, but not a great one</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen John Carpenter's original Assault on Precinct 13, but it is regarded as a cult classic of the action film genre, because of the way it seamlessly combined action, humour and suspense all into one package. A feat that would not be replicated until Die Hard.Whether or not the remake will be afforded the same recognition remains to be seen, but on its own terms, it succeeds as a suspenseful, pulse pounding action adventure, even if it falls a bit short in parts.The original had no famous faces, but this one has quite a few, such as Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, Gabriel Byrne, and Brian Dennehy. The cast certainly can't be faulted. It's in some of the plot logistics the film lets itself down.Beginning with a prologue into Ethan Hawke's character, Roenik, he is a cop undercover on a drug bust. But when it goes wrong, Roenick ends up losing two of his partners, and his nerve is shaken. Eight months later, he is pulling desk duty at the dilapidated 13th precinct, he's a bit of a pill popper, and he is seeing a psychiatrist.Working the night shift on New Years Eve, Roenick is manning the precinct with a skeleton crew, made up of himself, Jasper (Dennehy), a cop who's about to retire, the secretary and Roenick's doctor. At the same time, a prison bus is holding a group of criminals, including Marion Bishop (Fishburne), a powerful mobster, due to testify in court. But because of a heavy blizzard, the roads are closed, forcing the bus driver to dump them at the 13th precinct.Not long after, a group of assailants surround the building, led by corrupt cop Duvall (Byrne), who have come to kill Bishop, before his testimony incriminates all the corrupt cops on the force. With a wide range of artillery at Duvall's disposal, our heroes barricade themselves inside Precinct 13, free the criminals and band together if they ever hope to live through the night.On the action front, AOP13 certainly doesn't disappoint. There are too many gun fights to mention, but they never get wearisome. And the action is nicely paced too, with some genuine jolts along the way, with some of the likable characters getting killed too. There is also legitimate paranoia when it comes to light there is an insider in their midst. I was genuinely surprised by who that person was.But despite the nicely sustained claustrophobic atmosphere and impressive set pieces, some of the plot contrivances keep AOP13 from scaling the same heights as recent action films such as Collateral. One thing that kept ticking in the back of my mind was the fact that the bad guys on the outside have such an impressive collection of firepower, and they still can't breach the building. You have to try to ignore glaring plot holes like that. Also the sudden inclusion of a forest in Detroit at the climax threw me for six. And why don't the phones and mobiles work either?There are some marvellous performances though. Hawke is adequate, if a bit wimpy in the title role, but Fishburne is fantastic as Bishop. He commands every scene he is in without ever raising his voice. He actually seems the master criminal he is made out to be. And that is a rarity in action films. The last time I saw such a performance was Alan Rickman's Hans Gruber.Gabriel Byrne is not bad as Duvall, but he doesn't really get much to do beyond standing outside the building. He only gets one really memorable scene, which shocked me with it's sudden brutality. Brian Dennehy adds sterling support as always, and it's nice to see him again in a film role after so long.As the hours tick away and the violence increases AOP13 is anything if not engaging. I can't say I was ever bored. And I thought it was gratifying for the action to take place over the course of one night. But it falls apart quickly at the end. Shifting the scene to an inexplicable forest, there's some good camera-work as Roenick, Bishop and Duvall hunt each other, but the ending feels a little low-key. In much the same way Die Hard 2 didn't live up to the flawless original. It couldn't recapture Die Hard's style, and often became mindless.Assault on Precinct 13 is by no means a bad film. It succeeds on the action front for the most part, but it has a few implausibilities too many, and compared to some of the other action films of late, it only seems like a runner-up.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assualt on Precinct 13 suffers from a disease called CRM, also known as Cliché Ridden Movie. Assault's plot is about a old precinct in Detriot that is going to be shut down and on one of its last nights a group of crooked cops try to break in and kill a mob boss who is being held there.As i said earlier, clichés are all over the place, take the cast of characters for instance. The feature cop that has fallen from grace (Ethan Hawke), disgruntled vet (Brian Dennehy), a hot secretary (Drea de Matteo), a shrink who has the hots for the main character (Maria Bello), a mob boss (Laurence Fishburne), and a junkie (John Leguizamo). Both sides of the law are thrown together in order to save eachothers lives. So what saves this movie from total failure? Two things: the acting and its awesome fight scenes. Of course the good acting is saying much because the plot is terrible, but the fight sequences, oh man, they should start putting them in video games. Assault is a good time for two hours, after thats it means nothing. Their are no metaphors of questions that will linger on after the movie. Rent it, have a good time, then ditch it.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishborne were cool in their roles and Maria Bello was after A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE again very sexy. I warn you there are some violent bloody scenes and unfortunately always the same ones and not so much action. It begins slow but then the movie develops fast pace with some good plots and twists.

		<fullReview>Assault On Precinct 13 is a non-stop action flick about an old police station that is closing down on New Year's Eve with only two cops and a secretary inside. Marion Bishop, a cop killing gangster, is being transported to a maximum security prison, but the weather is too bad, so the transport stops at precinct 13 to keep him there until the storm subsides. When it is learned that Bishop is staying there, a S.W.A.T. team made up of crooked cops head to precinct 13 to take Bishop down before he can testify against them, and they don't intend on leaving survivors.The plot to this updated remake is more complicated than the original, and it makes it fun. You have to look at it as a different movie, because they're both good for different reasons. The acting is good in this movie, aside from Ja Rule who should never touch another film. The action is non-stop and exciting. Everything in the movie leads up to a fairly good twist ending. This movie is definitely worth the fee to rent.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>but cliché ridden. I didn't think an action flick with Ethan Hawk as the lead would be very good, but this turned out OK. It was your average plot that went exactly as you expect. Someone turns out to be the bad guy who doesn't appear to be. And then you have the cliché character of Iris, the secretary at the precinct, who talks tough and swears all the time. I hated her. The "hero" is a cop who was demoted for getting his team killed and is now addicted to pain killers. There's the old cop and then the therapist. On a snowy night, a bus carrying several prisoners, including Marion Bishop, a notorious gangster must make an emergency stop at a precinct that is getting ready to close down. What makes no sense is there is no way for them to communicate to the outside. It's a police station. Don't they have a cb radio or some cell phone that works. The station comes under attach by men who want Bishop because he has the goods on them. So, it is survival of the fittest.FINAL VERDICT: Quite a bit of action. Entertaining enough. I recommend it if you really like action films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was much better than I had expected, being a big fan of the original. In this version, instead of a street gang attacking the precinct we have corrupted cops trying to preserve their own freedom. The action is plentiful, but it didn't seem to pack the same punch as it's predecessor (no ice cream scene in this one, sorry). Most of the actors seemed to be going through the motions, but Ethan Hawke did a really good job in the lead role as did Lawrence Fishburne. Gabriel Byrne just seemed misused here. I think the reason the movie didn't do very well at the box office was it's a remake of a film that's rather obscure .But the film's saving grace was the action and the atmosphere. For that and that alone, I'll give this movie a 6/10. A decent remake, worth renting on DVD but not worth owning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining update of a classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ASSAULT is a remake of a John Carpenter flick from the '70s, which in turn was a reworking of a John Wayne flick, RIO BRAVO. This version of ASSAULT is gritty, dark and violent as it tells the tale of a rundown, isolated station house that on its final day of operation -- New Year's Eve, no less -- takes in a convict, played by Laurence "Call Me Larry" Fishburne, whom a pack of rogue cops, led by Gabriel Byrne, is out to destroy. Within 20 minutes of the film's opening, these cops have begun to lay siege to the crumbling building, which they quickly cut off from all contact with the outside world. The few folks still on duty -- Ethan Hawke as the station's shell-shocked sergeant, Drea de Matteo as his secretary, Maria Bello as a police shrink and Brian Dennehy as a retiring cop -- must make a last stand against a veritable army of bad cops who seriously outgun them. Except for a couple of talky stretches, this movie means business and pulls very few punches thanks to its R rating. We see lots of killing, some of it bloody, some of it not, including several shots to the head. Hawke is in great form as the benumbed sergeant who ends up rallying the troops, which includes Fishburne and several other hooligans in lockup. The ragtag defenders do pretty well, all things considered, until about two-thirds of the way through when the bad guys start chewing them up like Jason knocking off a bevy of teenage campers. We then race to an ending that is far-fetched but fun. See it for Hawke.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slightly more fun than the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits They've finally caught him - scumbag gangster Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne) is finally behind bars. Hauled in on New Year's Eve with all the other convicts, he's now just another convict like all the rest of them. However, when a blizzard sets in, the prison bus transporting him breaks down and they're asked to be housed at the run-down, under-staffed precinct 13, due to be torn down early in the new year. All is well until the phone lines are cut, strange noises are heard and it becomes clear that a group of masked men have taken over the precinct. Their motive appears to be to stop Bishop testifying against them at a trial but all is not clear and events get more mysterious as they roll on...I didn't like the first one that much (or maybe it was just over me at the time) so why I'd want to see a remake might seem a bit unclear at first. But this is a new spin on the original story and I liked it a bit more than the original.There is a good build-up and good character development. But on the other hand, the tense situation (i.e. the blizzard setting in) isn't exploited to it's full potential and it's basically a mix of good performances and bad performances. Fishburne is well-suited for his cool, assured delivery as the villain, John Leguizamo also works his edgy hispanic guy thing well in his role as the resident crack-head, video favourite Brian Dennehy provides good support and Drea de Matteo/Maria Bello are nice eye-candy. On the other hand, Ethan Hawke doesn't deliver much of a convincing performance in the lead role and Ja Rule isn't on the screen long enough to make much of an impression.This is Jean-Francois Richet's first non-foreign language entry and there's a distinctive use of style in this film. So, it's a different film to the original-but one I found slightly more enjoyable. ***</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the original, you should enjoy this modern update with enough plot twist to make Mr Fantastic green with envy. This action flick takes into a new direction that most of the cliché, "He killed my father now he's gonna pay", theme. Although it is regarded as too simple it can make you wonder how the writers of this and the original came up with this stuffA sergeant who just had his team killed in a drug bust gone wrong, keeps himself quiet behind the desk of a rickety old precinct nearing demolition. But before that, he must hold a self-doubt full female gang banger, a street dealer/smuggler, an annoying junkie and the star of the moment, Bishop, a gangster hit-man with the reputation of Hitler. But things go awry when a group of cops come barging in with the intention of knocking of everyone in the precinct before they can cut off their fingers in court. Now the popo and street scum must work together if they wanna make it through new years in one piece.It's witty, dark, explosive and a downright good time. Action fans do not miss this one. Even if it flopped in the box office, it's still a fine film. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Way too much gun pointing and gun cocking to be realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not a gun nut or anything; but when a movie goes this far over the top violating the simple principles of how a weapon works just for emotional impact, it removes all credibility from the movie. In one scene a character cocked his weapon three times for emotional impact. But, in reality this process which loads a bullet into the chamber of the weapon and clears any bullet currently in the chamber, would have expelled 2-3 unused bullets on to the floor. Also without giving anything away, all the opposing team would have had to do to win was use riot gas a few times. I guess, If you had nothing else to watch, and you don't mind one unrealistic event after another, you could probably do worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inevitable comparisons to the original, but nonetheless enjoyable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the classic 1976 John Carpenter effort will no doubt get the movie buffs coming out the closet and I must confess that the first thing the movie did was make me want to see the original again. So i did. And I have to admit that this more Hollywood friendly version does bear scrutiny.My original feeling was that the 2005 remake was trying to cram too many layers into the plot and that the original version was a stripped back, raw effort that benefited from it's low-fi feel. However when I watched it again I have to admit it would have been pretty dull to remake it with the gang tensions of the late Seventies and this more police-biased remake actually has a lot going for it.The opening sequence with Hawke is superb and builds a credible background to the disaffected cop. Both female interests, Maria Bello (Hawke's police psychiatrist) and Drea De Matteo (streetwise, gun-toting secretary) turn in contrasting and strong performances. However, the star of the show is Fishburne, whose commanding presence as the crime-lord Bishop with his ambiguous, mercenary code of ethics, make for some interesting conflicts with Hawke. John Leguizamo also adds a bit of pathos and off-beat craziness to the whole effort as an incarcerated drug-addict, and Gabriel Byrne reprises his cop-gone-bad routine.Overall it's an action-packed movie with some twists and turns and strong character performances. Todays audiences by and large demand fast-paced action, great photography and gritty dialogue with a multi-layered plot... and for the most part you get it with this film. In doing so unfortunately some of the 'pin-drop' tension and suspense from the original version's 'emptiness' is lost along the way. I don't think this is a classic but it's certainly worth a trip to the cinema to enjoy it 'full-screen' ... oh and at least that annoying early-80s electronica soundtrack from the original has gone (although i'm sure there'll be some that think that was a classic too!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Sgt. Roenick is jockeying a desk after an undercover bust leaves his team dead and a bullet in his leg. His job is simple, finish packing up a defunct precinct on its last night and enjoy New Years Eve. But when a horrible snowstorm reroutes a con-bus carrying an assortment of criminals to Precinct 13 all hell breaks loose. One of the cons is cop-killer crime boss Bishop who is the target of a faceless group of thugs trying to bail him out...or are they?On its own merits it isn't a bad film, horribly clichéd maybe, but not bad. It has plenty of action, decent but unexceptional acting and a rather surprising amount of headshots. Direction was good for the most part, some of the hand-held action was out of place, but nothing horribly wrong. Good sound design permeates the attack sequences. Most of the technical stuff was good in a middle-of-the-road sort-of fashion. That said, it still doesn't hold a candle to the original, this time around is mostly a re-imagining that well not fresh, isn't a bad problem. I think what I missed most was the relentless pace at which the original's last 40 or so minutes were. This time the cops had way too much time to kill and what little character buildup was light for the most part.***Original spoiler*** The famous execution pf the little girl scene is not present. Nor did I ever think they would try. That is something we will never see in any type of Hollywood flick. ***end spoilers***I give a 7/10 for being an entertaining film, which is really all I could ask for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dumb but entertaining movie ruined by adding plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's original Assault on Precinct 13 plays off more like a horror movie than an action flick. On the last day of a ghetto precinct the top gang appears in the hundreds outside and write "Cholo" (To the Death).While the movie was silly it worked as a suspense thriller. Namely because like Carpenter's own Halloween movie the bad guys don't talk. They are this looming dark presence in the movie.The original is 90% action, either they are shooting to save their lives, or they are running to save their lives.Why did they think they could do this movie without John Carpenter? The original was fun but a bit dated with poor film quality. I would have liked to see Carpenter remake this himself.------------------------ In this "remake" the original idea is thrown out and the bad guys become dirty cops that show up in the dozens to keep them silent. Their motivation tries to play on our sympathy, and it fails. Characters die, but a few of them just vanish without a death scene.About 10% of this movie is action, the remainder is loaded with dialog intended to be tense, but comes off as boring. I don't care about the downtrodden cop, or how badass the crime boss is, or how dysfunctional the Psychiatrist is. The conflict was supposed to be between the Besieged and the Besiegers, instead we get intense standoff followed by more intense standoff. I was counting how many times a person was out in the open and could have been shot.Anyway stick with the original and hope he remasters it, this is terrible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loud and graphic but enjoyable recycling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First off, the "original" other film critics keep referring to is actually a remake, itself. John Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" is really a remake of an older western entitled simply, "Rio Bravo." So while everyone keeps whining about remakes, let it be known that they have always remade older works. Always. At any rate, as far as remakes go, this one is a tad better than decent. Not surprisingly, it surpasses neither of the originals in atmosphere, content, and execution. However, it is still quite well put together and very enjoyable. Having been built around Carpenter's solid plot, there are some new innovations used as "industrial siding" all around the outer edges. While some elements were shaky, it had the solidity of Carpenter's previous work to stabilize it.I won't detail the plot as that has been done repeatedly here at IMDb, but suffice it to say that it remains fairly faithful to the source materials, without giving us a blow by blow carbon copy of either previous versions.Action fans will find this a delight, and those who are fans of police dramas will also find it interestingly entertaining. Those among the audience in my hometown theater were enthralled. We aren't a town of demonstrative people; there aren't many walk outs, and the occasions where there is applause are few and far between. There were instances of neither for this event.Carpenter fans, however, may be a bit affronted by this work.All in all, this was a fun cinematic experience with superb direction, amazing vision, and some great execution. Featured are some surprise "kills," peppered with predictable turns. It was unfortunate, in my opinion, that they chose to make create their "street gang" out of corrupt police officers. It did make me appreciate Carpenter's version all the more. I missed the now infamous "Ice Cream Scene." But it was still quite enjoyable."Without pause, without regard."It rates a 7/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this remake last night and must say that it was an extremely enjoyable two hours right from the get-go. The opening of the story is one of the best I've seen in years, and throughout the acting is solid which wasn't surprising with this cast, but the dialogue was great all the way through, which you don't usually get in films anymore, and the action and building of tension was done very well by the director, his choreographers, and the composers. Top notch performance from Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, and Brian Dennehy. Very solid leading lady turn for Drea DeMatteo, as well as from Maria Bello. And the casting of Gabriel Bryne as the villain is genius although I would have liked to have seen him do a bit more on screen with Hawke and Fishburne. Overall, a solid 9 out of 10 for giving me some things in a film that I'll remember simply because there unexpected and done really well. Go see this film if you like good action filled thrillers, I promise as a filmmaker myself, it won't disappoint.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heck of an Assault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Smooth, organized, and equally energetic. These are the last adjectives I would use to describe John Carpenter's Early work, which is why I was sceptic about seeing his 1972 version. Even though I find Carpenter to be a 'win some lose some' director, I consider myself a fan. Anyway the point I am trying to get at is this. Put your thoughts about Carpenter aside if you try this. Remakes that are updated for the twenty first century are also a 'win some lose some' trend in cinema. This one is a case of the former. Despite a plot that has numerous holes, Assault on Precinct 13 delivers.It is New Years eve, and snowing like heck in Detroit. Inside Precinct 13, Sergent Roenick and a few of his staff are having a little party. Also inside the precinct (only behind bars) is infamous drug king Marion Bishop. At midnight a nasty surprise comes, a bunch of snipers attempt to siege the building. at first it looks as if Bishop's guys have come to break him out, but it soon becomes evident that these goons are intent on killing Bishop. Roenick knowing that all their lives are in danger tries to pull everybody together Including Bishop and his fellow inmates, in an attempt to make a stand.Though definitely not a comedy, the movie doesn't take itself very seriously. That is definitely a good thing considering that the storyline is bogus. There are a number of errors, in addition to some old clichés like the bad guys being bad shots, but the film finds is crafted well enough that we the viewers allow them to slide. At one point it even makes reference to the bad shooting issue.Assault on Precinct 13, is a film that delivers what it intends to, and that, I call satisfactory.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good remake of an excellent film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, in the wake of eternal remakes, it was only a matter of time 'till one of John Carpenter's best films got on board. Carpenter's original was itself somewhat of a remake and it was simply astounding and this time, I dare say, the filmmakers did an excellent job as well. What does this prove; To me at least that when there's a good story on hand, it takes a bad set of people to mess it up.Carpenter's story basically holds up. A soon to be shut down police precinct, with only a few people, is under siege and it's up to the policemen at hand, along with some civilians and criminals to band together and fight the bad guys. There are some changes made this time around, such as the bad guys are no longer faceless gang members but corrupt policemen.There are some clichés here to be sure and some plot holes as well but when all is said and done what remains here is one mean and fast moving action flick with a number surprises and shocks thrown in as well. Cast does an excellent job and all technical aspects are well handled. A very violent film, sure, but immensely satisfying for fans of good action films. I wouldn't go so far as to say it's better than the original, I still like it better, but it's a hell of a lot of fun all the same.Highly recommended</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a solid action packed movie. Ethan Hawke gives easily his best performance since Training Day. He really is excellent as a strung out cop. The best thing about this movie is there are really no good guys other than Ethan Hawke's character, who has his own problems. Also, the movie is not afraid to kill off main characters as part of the story. This gave the movie a realistic flavor. My only problems with the film is the forced "twist" with Denneys character and Larry Fishburne seemed to be on cruise control for parts of the movie. Those are really minor complaints.

		<shortDescription>Almost as good as original; fun time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This stylish remake of John Carpenter's 1976 low-budget thriller is a fair shade better than most remakes, nearly approaching the edginess of the original. If not for the bigger budget, it might have even been as good.It's New Year's Eve at dilapidated Precinct 13, which is closing down. Just about all on-duty cops have been reassigned to other precincts, and all that's left are Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), and Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo). And all is pretty quiet, in the midst of a thick snowstorm, until a bus of convicts is rerouted to lucky Precinct 13. One of the convicts is gangster Marion Bishop (Larry Fishburne), who's due to testify in front of a grand jury.Wouldn't you know it, the placid precinct is infiltrated by two masked men who are quickly thwarted by Roenick. The intruders - quickly joined outside by a posse of similarly disguised thugs - aren't there to bust Bishop out, however - they're there to kill him. And they're not criminals, exactly; they're cops.So Roenick has to fend off the corrupt cops and keep his team from killing each other. He has to rely on the talents of the other convicts and must explicitly trust Bishop - the baddies outside have superior numbers, headed by Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), and they'll stop at nothing to kill Bishop, along with everyone else in the building.Hawke, who looked pretty handy with a gun in Training Day, is really good here, as his Jake keeps his head while all those around him lose theirs. And, lucky fella, he has not one but two hot women to serve and protect - de Matteo's Iris and Maria Bello's Alex Sabian, Roenick's shrink. Toss in Dennehy as the grizzled veteran about to call it a career, John Leguizamo as a hyperactive junkie, and Ja Rule as... well, Ja Rule, and you have all flavors of cliché.But funny thing about this unoriginal piece of work - it's pretty good. Director Jean-Francois Richet does an admirable job with the atmosphere, with close-up cinema verite angles that make you feel the cops are breathing down your neck. The movie's well paced, too, with little letup in action; luckily, there are no slow moments of restful contemplation. No sir, this is not an action movie for tenderhearts.Among the supporting case, de Matteo, Ja Rule, Leguizamo, and especially Fishburne come off best; not so much for Bello, Byrne, and Dennehy, although they don't seem to have had much to work with. Bello's character in particular is annoying and probably didn't need to be in the movie, although her raison d'etre is apparent late in the film. Byrne looks as stonefaced as always, as evocative as a damp sponge. But that's Gabriel Byrne's own raison d'etre.Intense, well-directed and filmed, this remake of a remake (following 1959's Rio Bravo) is likable on many levels. If the idea of a remake was tackled with as small of a budget as its 1976 predecessor, this might have been quite a work of art. As it is, still very entertaining.</fullReview>

From opening to closing the movie was interesting, it kept me wanting to watch it, which is what a good movie should do. Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) had a truly excellent cast, everyone was brilliant, especially Maria Bellow, Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fisburne and Drea de Matteo. The movie had plenty of action, thrills and suspense. The characters all interacted well with each other, especially under the tense circumstances. The death of Maria Bello's character was unexpected and truly sad. The movie was also fun in that it kept you guessing who the traitor was all the way through.

Together Duvall &amp; his men surround Precinct 13 &amp; try to kill Bishop but Roenick upholds the law &amp; fights to protect Bishop &amp; the other's inside Precinct 13 but they are outnumbered &amp; out-gunned as Duvall gets ever more desperate...This American French co-production was directed by Jean-François Richet &amp; is a remake of the classic John Carpenter thriller Assault on Precinct 13, while some may dislike a remake by it's very nature I have no problems with them at all (the original film still exists so what's their problem?) &amp; Assault on Precinct 13 is one of those occasions where I think the remake is better than that overrated original which when you actually watch it it isn't really anything special. The script here has significant changes to the themes of the plot but still retains the basic premise of a soon to be closed police station coming under siege &amp; those trapped inside having to fight against the odds for survival. The whole set-up is different here though, there's in no girl or gang leader or even gang members for that matter as Bishop is a cop killer &amp; it's the corrupt cops themselves who want him dead as he can put them all away in prison for a long time. I actually really liked this remake, I liked the character's especially Bishop who forms an uneasy truce with Roenick in order to save themselves &amp; his exchange with Maria Bello's character is brilliant as Bishop says 'they are here to kill us all' to which Bello replies 'even me?' &amp; Bishop coolly says 'to kill us all... especially you' which is one of my favourite lines of dialogue I have heard in ages &amp; Fishburnes delivers it perfectly with both sarcasm &amp; coldness. The other's are good too with a veteran cop, a slutty secretary &amp; some other prisoners. The film moves along at a good pace, there's plenty of action, it's pretty suspenseful &amp; gritty at times &amp; there are even a few plot twist's &amp; surprises along the way including the brutal murder of one character who i would have put money on making it. On the negative side the bad guy's once again can't shoot straight &amp; despite being massively outnumbered those trapped inside Precinct 13 do a pretty good job of holding off an elite team of highly trained commandos.The cold bleak snowy winter setting is great, there's a grey sort of colour scheme which gives everything a cold sort of feel which works well. The action scenes are good &amp; there's none of that quick editing or shaky hand-held camera crap, most of the character's wear dark clothes which sometimes makes it hard to see who's shooting at who but the action is generally clear, concise &amp; well staged. There seems to be a direct homage to Die Hrad 2 (1990) as a bad guy gets an icicle in the eye. The effects are mostly of the on-set practical variety &amp; there's very little CGI here.With a fairly modest budget of about $20,000,000 this looks great &amp; has good production design. Filmed in Detroit &amp; in Ontario in Canada. The acting is really good with Fishburne excellent as the bad guy, Etahn Hawke puts in a good shift as does John Leguizamo &amp; Gabriel Byrne is just a quality actor in whatever role he has anyway. Maria Bello is alright, Drea de Matteo is hot, Ja Rule's part is thankfully small while veteran Brian Dennehy also puts in a good performance.Assault on Precinct 13 is a neat little thriller remake that has action, suspense, tension, a few twist's, some great performances from a good cast &amp; overall I think is better than the original. I liked it a lot, more than I thought I would anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Potty-mouthed, tough-talking cop film, preposterous to the max. One can easily rip the film to shreds psychoanalyzing the mistakes and holes in the plot. I can understand if many loathe it for the very fact that a saboteur is among those in the precinct and yet he doesn't just plug everyone despite the fact that they have no knowledge of this person's outside criminal activities. You could question how a few people on the inside of a precinct could fend off professional cops with high-tech equipment and state-of-the-art weaponry without major casualties.Or, you could just say the hell with it and enjoy it despite it's numerous faults. I realized it's a ridiculous action-packed film where Ethan Hawke seems to be the luckiest cop in the world because he can evade gunfire despite those shooting having the very best snipers shooting with their night-scope.The film is a very loose remake of John Carpenter's superior remake(that film was set in LA), this time set in a wintry Detroit precinct on it's way to being closed down. As we see in the thrilling opening sequence, Ethan Hawkes' Roenick loses his undercover crew when a drug bust goes awry. He's mentally shaken by this and is now a Sergeant behind the desk of the soon-to-extinct precinct awaiting another desk-job reassignment. His night crew consists of Secretary Iris(Drea de Matteao), who has a thing for bad boys, and soon-to-be retired cop Jasper(Brian Dennehy). Their peaceful night is shattered when a bus driver must stop his vehicle, with criminals aboard including drug crime-lord Marion Bishop(Laurence Fishburne), at the old precinct to await out the winter blizzard that has erupted causing badly icy roads.That takes us to the up and coming siege of the 13th Precinct by Duvall(Gabriel Byrne)and his corrupted police cronies. They have been in partnership with Bishop for sometime, but the drug-lord doesn't wish to do business with them anymore(he kills one of Duvall's men in a church early on before being caught by police). Afraid he'll testify, therefore possibly bringing down 33 men on the force, Duvall will eliminate all those present in the precinct after Roenick discovers, when venturing outside towards the bus killing one of them in a fight, that the police are behind the attack.The film spends most of the film showing Roenick trying to find out how he and those inside the precinct, including three other prisoners with Bishop(John Leguizamo, Ja Rule and Aisha Hinds)and his department-appointed psychiatrist(Maria Bello), will survive an onslaught of consistent gunfire. Worse even still is how they will ever make it out of the precinct to possibly get help. The precinct is located around abandoned industrial plants where no human life is around to hear the constant barrage of bullet-fire. But, what even makes matters worse is someone among them is working for Duvall.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My friends and I rented this movie with no idea on what it is. We just rented this because we wanted to watch an action flick and with limited time to decide. It turned out it was a whole lot better than we expected. This movie kept me biting my finger nails and shaking my knees throughout its entire running time. A cop, burden with survivor's guilt over the loss of his team traded his field job for one behind a desk. He blames himself for the loss of his team. However, the situation repeats when a bus full of prisoners was forced to stop at his precinct with an infamous criminal. The problem turn out of control when the precinct becomes under attack. This movie was completely unpredictable, filled with a lot of action, some awesome gun fighting, and some bad-ass characters. It was Awesome! The director did a wonderful job, the cast is excellent, and the story was hands down the best. There's nothing more you can ask from a this thriller.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's New Year's eve, a cop-killer (in the form of, Laurence Fishburne) end up at a precinct that's closing down due till snow. When the people are layed siege on, cops have to team up with cons to survive. This re-make of the John Carpenter classic just had to add a few beyond stupid plot twists, take out all the tension, and add a horrid John Lequizamo to the cast, didn't it? The first film was thrilling, gritty, and a joy to watch. This one is more Hollywood, clichéd, and painful to behold. The only thing I took from this movie was OCD can be very annoying...VERY. The ending song is SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO bad.My Grade: D- DVD Extras: Commentary by Richet, Demonaco and Jeffrey Silver; Delet scenes with optional commentary; 5 minute "Armed and Dangerous" featurette on the weapons expert; 7 and a half minute "behind Precinct Walls"; "Plan of Attack"; "The Assault Team"; 12 and a half minute behind the scenes featurette;, Trailers for "Unleashed", "White Noise", :Seed of Chucky" Miscelanious: I got this at Best Buy and it came with a bonus disc including the first 2 minutes of "Cry Wolf"; a 10 minute first look at "Unleashed"; the trailer for that film; and a Fuzion interview with John Leguizamo</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Those in the auditing profession would recognize the acronym "value for money". AP 13 returns value for the money you pay, i.e. price for the admission, no more, no less.The set up is classic: a worn down police station in what used to be the "murder capital of the States" Detroit (don't know if still is), a blinding blizzard on New Year's Eve, an arch villain vs a burn out cop, an assemblage of characters that you'll find only too familiar if you have been watching enough movies and a high strung, explosive stand off. Yes, it's all been done before, even in a movie with the same name (a polite way of saying that this is a re-make)..Ethan Hawke, a high calibre actor, has his best scene in the opening sequence playing an undercover cop Jake trying to trap a gang of drug dealers. In many cases (particularly for James Bond movies) the opening sequence has no relevance to the rest of the movie. Here, it does, because the death of Jake's two comrades has him so traumatised that eight months later, when the main story happens, he still needs visits from a police psychiatrist, an awkward way of bringing a beautiful woman (Maria Bello) into this movie, which is totally unnecessary, but not un-welcomed. But let me back up a little.In a nutshell, this is a siege and assault action movie. Due to the blizzard, king pin "Bishop" (Laurence Fishburne) and three other prisoners have to be left in Jake's tender loving care at Precinct 13 on New Year's Eve. Mysterious, faceless attackers looking like a crossover of Ku Klux Klan and Storm Troopers (still remember the ORIGINAL Star Wars?) materialize out of nowhere with hardware that can support a Panzer assault. Never mind how a handful of people, including the prisoners freed temporarily to help out, can hold off the attack with sometimes just hand guns. The action is exciting, beautifully shot and accompanied by first class sound effect. This is where the value of AP 13 lies.Did I mention that the attackers, believed initially to be Bishop's rescuers, turn out to be crooked policemen who want to kill him before he exposes them? Well, you'll find out anyway early enough in the movie. The temporarily freed prisoners, given guns to help, are obviously another source of tension. Finally, Jake and Bishop are two adversaries joining force temporarily to face common enemies, and gaining considerable respect for each other in the process, in the good old tradition of John Woo police movies. This may even lead to a sequel!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought this was a pretty good movie for a remake, even though I have never seen an original. I thought the cast did a pretty good job and there are a couple of the actors that I really like to begin with. For example, Laurence Fishburn is one of my favorite actors so he pretty much can do no bad movies in my eyes. I would recommend this film for anyone that likes so-so action and a good story line. I did think that it was pretty realistic as far as what can happen when a prison system is either going thru transition or being closed down. The weather issue was pretty interesting to me also since I'm from the northern part of the United States and I've seen for myself what the weather can be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scene reminded me of Narc, with the way the scene was shot, on a hand-held, with NYPD Blues-like motion, shootout and chase. However, this film lacked the sophistication nor intriguing storyline that Narc offered.Ethan Hawke plays a cop suffering from the guilt of a failed undercover mission which saw 2 of his colleagues die. Lawrence Fishburne, on the other hand, plays a cop-killer mafiaso type, who initially I thought was playing Morpheus all over again, with his pseudo-philosophy sounding character.The premise of the movie is simple enough, nothing more than your usual actioner. A cop-killer is caught and while being transported with other baddies to a secure jailhouse, the severe new year's eve blizzard brings them to Detriot's Precinct 13 for a temporal lockup. Corrupt cops who want the cop-killer dead for their own selfish reasons, plan and try to storm Precinct 13, kill everyone, and put the blame on thugs.Since Precinct 13 is on the verge of a closure for good, the limited manpower (count: 3 cops and 1 psychologist) have to cooperate with the jailbirds (count: 4), and vice versa, to make it out alive against a group of corrupt cops (count: 33 or so) with high tech weaponry (night vision goggle, sniper rifles, assault rifles etc). Sort of like Panic Room, where you're held up in a confined space, while the villains try and infiltrate.Character building is practical zero - we have one dimensional characters, and whatever limited characters we know of, just adds to the body count. Faceless, dialogue-less characters also add to death in creative ways. But hey, it's a no-brainer action movie, so keep your expectations down (sorry, it's Oscar season) The only theme being explored here, if at all, is the theme of responsibility. Ethan Hawke has and understands his responsibility as Precinct team leader to keep his teammates, and those under his custody, alive, even if it means sleeping with the enemy, figuratively. While on the flip side, we have a corrupt cop (led by Gabriel Byrne) wanting to keep his end of the bargain in maintaining and protecting his corrupt team from prosecution, if Fishburne makes it to the courthouse alive.Standard action flick with a minor twist at the end to facilitate the plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a remake of a remake of a remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After finally seeing the movie, I came away mostly struck by the similarities between it and John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. So in a way I suppose the lineage of this film is Rio Bravo-&gt;Assault on Precinct 13-&gt;Ghosts of Mars-&gt;Assault on Precinct 13. I was particularly taken by Maria Bello's performance. She really got on my nerves, which I suppose, is a good thing.One comment about all the sharpshooters who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn: They were shooting little M-16 type rounds. Those are notoriously unstable in high winds. I'm sure that wasn't part of some screenwriter's confab but it's the out they need.Overall a fairly entertaining movie tho in all likelihood it won't be sitting in my DVD collection anytime soon. And yes, you could see the "twists" coming a mile away. Even in the snowstorm.</fullReview>

Assault on Precinct 13 is no contender for some of the other more meaningful, plot driven and unpredictable ending films that are currently around.NOTE to IMDb why doesn't Laurence Fishburne get a mention in the cast list ? As a supporting character he was his enigmatic self and for me the only highlight.The rest of the cast are doubtless suffering from wood worm since their acting was pitiful. The story line obvious to everyone except my cat. There were few if any twists and I wondered what I'd spent my money on seeing.

		<shortDescription>Not too bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was not aware that this movie was a remake, and went into it with no preconceptions about whether it would be good or not. Expecting to see both Ethan Hawke and Lawrence Fishburne, I was pleasantly surprised at the rest of the cast as well. John Leguizamo, Brian Dennehy and Drea De Mateo were all decent choices for their supporting roles. This movie does contain a lot of graphic violence and few punches are pulled. What I particularly enjoyed was the very brief "moral dilemmas" the characters underwent. Hawke having to decide if he can kill another cop for example. Whereas some movies would draw this out over a matter of minutes, his character realizes in an instant that he can, and then brutally and without remorse, goes about the business of protecting those within his charge. I would have to say that I rate movies on how much I would expect to pay to see them... Free being a crap movie, Cineplex being a great movie, and a rental somewhere in the middle. This movie is definitely a rental. If you are a fan of action movies, this will keep you entertained for 2 hours and you will have gotten your $5 worth. Be advised though guys...if you make your wife/girlfriend sit through this bloodbath, expect an evening of The Notebook...followed by hours of talk about your relationship...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so bad..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>OK so I really wanted to see In Good Company.But I was outvoted by my adrenaline junkie friends. Assault on Precinct 13 it is. Two-and-a-half hours and $9 later I felt... I guess satisfied is the best way to describe it.Like most people, I check the movie reviews before before I head out to the theaters. Assault has gotten mixed reviews, and currently is at 61% on RottenTomatoes.com The biggest complaint is that the flick cashes in on every action/adventure cliché you can think of.The story goes like this: Ethan Hawke plays a Detroit cop, having a hard time dealing with the death of his 2 partners during a failed drug bust. He gets shot in leg and is taken off of his undercover street job in favor of babysitting a police station about to be put out of commission. He goes in on New Year's Eve to close the place down with the secretary (Drea de Matteo), police psychologist (Maria Bello) and soon-to-be retired cop Jasper (Brian Dennehey). Unexpectedly a bus containing prisoners is diverted to the station. Of course the bus contains notorious mob boss Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne). Before they know it the place is surrounded by snipers, and Bishop unfolds the plot: he has bankrolled at least 30 dirty cops in Detroit and if he goes to trial he will take them down with him. Now the motley crew of prisoners and cops need to fight together to make it to the morning.What I liked: Ethan Hawke was very convincing as a struggling cop addicted to whiskey and pain killers and gives a real strong performance. Laurence Fishburne is also excellent, as is Gabriel Byrne, who probably has the smallest role of main antagonist in the history of film. John Leguizamo's character is funny and he really has some chemistry with Ja Rule, which was surprising. I didn't find it to be as cliché as most of the uptight critics did. A nice plot twist at the end.What I didn't like: Maria Bello's character is handled poorly in my opinion. She starts out promising and then... blah. Also I like Leguizamo but he does get old quick, and you're really rooting for him to get shot. Of course you should be prepared for a ton of violence.Overall I think this movie is deserving of a 7. I went into the movie not too thrilled to see it and actually enjoyed the movie.</fullReview>

Seeing that the movie was being remade, we couldn't wait to see the movie. However, we both felt that the original movie was much better, and had a far superior original story line. Some of the movie used a few plots from the original, however the movie left me feel short changed. The original movie had one of the best soundtracks, using a scary verse playing over and over. Kind of like the the things heard the Halloween series of movies. Also some of the best one liners were left out.. Like the phrase "The man is sick" and "I got this plan, called save ass. I climb thru this window and run like a ......" This movie was fun to watch and lots of shooting. But if you have seen the original it doesn't match up.</fullReview>

Ethan Hawke or Matt Dillon (I can't tell who the lead actor is, that's a pretty big point against the movie right there) Gabriel Byrne (who could't have needed the money this badly could he?) Drea De Matteo is stunning but only because of her amazing body. It took me ages to finally work out she's Joey's sister off "Friends". I agree that the so called SWAT people attacking the station are pretty crap, as far as tactics go. We were even taught better basic skills than this in RAF basic training.Avoid this, even the snow doesn't want to fall on a bus full of prisoners!

Other reviews have explained most the weak points, but I'll add a few more. Like "Jaws 3", where you root for the shark, you don't miss the characters as they get killed off two-by-two. The corrupt SWAT team adopts a kung-fu assault where they send in the cops one at a time as the others stand around. Hawk sits in his office drinking booze when you'd think he'd be guarding the door. And since they couldn't crawl through an air-conditioning duct to escape they had to walk through a utility tunnel. The most gruesome head shot was what this movie did to the audience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Respectable Comeback with a Slight Twist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shifting political and social landscapes brought about a generally altered version of John Carpenter's creepy urban stand-off when it was remade for the big screen. Not the most remarkable of his numerous projects, 13 was good enough for one hurrah but perhaps insufficient for two. Then again that's exactly what made the 21st century rendition enjoyable: not only did the long interim practically remove all memory of the original from collective movie goer psyches, it also provided a fresh slate for the newer project to build itself, and be judged, upon.So in fact we had on our hands a whole new product, with serious links to the past yet almost entirely on its own. Importantly, it was no longer a paranoid drama pitting the less bad against the evil, but rather your average jaded post-modern, information age potpourri of contemporary characters with their ensuing weaknesses and more well-rounded personalities. While Carpenter, who had next to nothing to do with the 2005 film, placed his story in desolate, crime-infested LA, this one moved shop to Detroit, where a police station in its last night of operation greets the new year amid a raging blizzard and threats from hostile forces bent on getting in. But these enemies were no longer a voiceless, ethereal federation of multi-ethnic gangbangers, as was the case when 13 first made the rounds in 1976. Instead, we received a more up to date brood of villains driven by genuine concerns, albeit wicked ones. They also talked a lot and pulled off a variety of stunts their predecessors never felt the need for, but essentially 13-05's producers remained loyal to the overall structure, if not feel, of Carpenter's original.While a high-tech army of eager special forces types amassed outside, the reluctant heroes trapped within the station house found themselves cut off from the rest of the world by way of the storm and their assailants' penchant for severing power, phone and cellular utilities. A much more believable scenario than 1976's rather surreal predicament, but then we had the 90's somewhere in the middle to wake us up.Regardless of all that, Ethan Hawke returned to the screen as a sort of vulnerable underdog champion, doing the lead, recalcitrant cop Jake Roenick. His wasn't too bad of an entry, and in fact it was easy to like the lad in this movie. Hawke teamed with a motley crew of unlikely protagonists, including murderer and underworld kingpin Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), a name in itself paying homage to the first incarnation, where the leading character was known as Ethan Bishop. Other personas comprised a similar hodgepodge of miscreants and law enforcement personnel, as seen before, although the new iteration spent less time showcasing their gradual bonding. John Leguizamo and Maria Bello both gave passable roles, as did Brian Dennehy, but all of them suffered from underdevelopment and inadequate screen time, problems inherent in this kind of fast-paced adventure. Ja Rule put in as small time crook Smiley, and was almost good at it, something that can't be said of Gabriel Byrne, who headed the baddie section. Mr. Byrne has appeared in quite a few mainstream capacities over the years, and seems less and less into them as time goes on. With 13-05 he must have hit an all time low, for we barely noticed his presence. Another equally shallow cameo was courtesy of Drea De Matteo, drawing on her sex appeal but foregoing the cool wit we loved so much during her tenure with the Sopranos.Of course, the new Assault on Precinct 13 benefited mostly from almost two decades of stylization and refinement, so its locales and sets took on more of a lived-in vibe, its villains moved away from turf rabble to become cutting edge SWAT-lookalikes with the latest in ass kicking gear, and the language gained a few extra F words, something we liked very much, since in these pseudo-correct times every R rated flick counts.However, some things stayed the same. The conflict still revolved around those outside trying to get people from inside the station house, people who supposedly deserve punishment but at the same time are endearing and likable. Also, both films share endings a bit on the abrupt and hastily resolved side, again a common trademark of stories built around action, suspense and a premise leaning towards the far-fetched.Even so, Assault on Precinct 13 was quite watchable, had some impressive action elements and did try to revitalize the ailing urban thriller niche. While not a classic, these pros alone made it noteworthy and fun, even though it lacked Carpenter's original, haunting soundtrack.Rating: * * *</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, not clean, but fun. This is not high, cinematic art, but a straightforward action flick the delivers fairly well in many areas. If however, you are going to see this because you are hoping for another Training Day, you will probably be disappointed quite a bit. The movie's weaknesses are mainly in the area of believability. Although certain unlikely events are explained, it's still a bit of a stretch as far as how the whole situation develops. What's more, the lengths to which the army of bad guy cops are willing to go to to stay out of jail are pretty insane. As well as the fact that it seems every single one of them is SWAT trained and equipped.However, if you can check your brain at the door, and view the rudimentary plot a simply as vehicle on which the ensuing action can ride, you'll probably enjoy yourself fairly well. The pacing is swift, the action scenes, although jerky at times, are fairly well played out, and there is a good amount of suspense and peril. The suspense however is somewhat muted by the fact that you won't really give a rip about the fates of some of the characters, not per se because they are criminals, more because they are annoying and cliché.I wasn't aware until about a week ago that this was a remake of a John Carpenter film (shame on me!) I think the fact that I haven't seen the original may very likely be a benefit, because I had nothing with which to compare this movie. I will say, though, that it did have the 'feel' of a Carpenter movie, which I enjoyed: Two lead anti-heroes, gritty violence, some humorous dialog, and a storyline that a ten year old could follow. On the other side of this coin, if you have seen the original, from everything I've read, this one is not as violent, and the bad guys are not gang members. So if that's a negative for you, you may want to stay home.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter made me a fan with the one-two punch of "Assault on Precinct 13" and "Halloween". Assault is my admitted favorite, a tribute to what good acting and directing can accomplish while working within a miniscule budget. Imagine my concern with the notion of a new version. Now imagine my delight and relief: I've seen the remake and I'm pleased. The most significant difference is that the new "Assault" features more established stars (wow, what a roster!). The director and editor avoided the modern pitfall (listen up, Stephen Sommers) of allowing trick photography and outlandish special effects to overwhelm the material. Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne thrust and parry nicely like two gladiators sizing up the competition. Gabriel Byrne, John Leguizamo and Brian Dennehy contribute nicely rounded characters. Other cast members are less known to me (perhaps better known to the younger audiences), but all do the material proud. The modified screenplay, the set designs and camera work squeeze the audience into an appropriately claustrophobic situation and space. Thanks to all involved for doing a professional and entertaining job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing that special but still a tense, gritty and enjoyable thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is New Years Eve and the police station for Precinct 13 has had its final year of operation as it is due to be mothballed and officer Jake Roenick is in charge of securing it and turning off all the lights. However bad weather forces a transport of prisoners to seek shelter in the station and Roenick opens up the cells to hold them temporarily. However, among the prisoners is one Marion Bishop who, aside from having a girls' name is also a big time mobster. Sadly for everyone in the station, Bishop can identify and name a whole bus load of corrupt cops ? cops who will do whatever it takes to stop him from taking down their operations; in this case "whatever it takes" will mean killing Bishop and everyone else in the station.Having already seen John Carpenter's remake of Precinct 13 (otherwise known as Ghosts of Mars) and I didn't think this remake could be worse than that even if I didn't see the point of remaking the original. After a bit too much of a build up the film gets going and when it does it does a good job of keeping it up until the end. The basic plot is, of course, not as convincing as the original mainly thanks to the addition of the dirty cops with a world-conquering arsenal at their disposal who cannot get into an old building held off by a handful of guys. Regardless of this the action is enjoyable and I did really get into it for the majority, thanks in part to just how tough it is. As with the original, the group is picked off one by one but it still surprised me just how violent and brutal it was ? it was effective in getting me involved and for having an impact in a way that the body count in a slasher movie does not.The cast is nicely put together so that you're not sure who will and won't make it. Hawke is well cast and his opening scene shows he can act even if the rest of the film is more about him as an action hero. Fishburne is not that good and here he just cannot shake the shadow of Morpheous and comes across as rather gruff but lacking interest. Bryne just takes the money and goes through the motions in an uninspiring way but his crew are all very impressive and do the whole "running with guns in SWAT outfits" really well. The people in the station are mixed ? Coates, Bello, Craven and Leguizamo are all good, Brian Dennehy was a surprise find in a cinema but I was annoyed by yet more African-American clichés from Ja Rule and the female gangbanger (forget her name).Overall this is an enjoyable film that will not replace the original but provides an effective thriller nonetheless. The direction makes good use of the blizzard to produce tension that it keeps up for the majority of the film thanks to some gritty and surprisingly brutal action. The cast do as required and, although it is nothing fantastic it is still work a look for some solid thrills.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid action...nothing more</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in the distant past, when John Carpenter made good, if not great films, he crafted a tale about a police station under siege by gang members who want their leader back. Very brutal and controversial at the time (in the opening moments of the film a young child is shot dead in the street), the film stands the test of time so well that you wonder if a remake is really necessary. However, it is the current fad these days to recreate old classics, and sometimes they garner good results (Ocean's 11, Dawn of the Dead).This film isn't on par with those two remakes, but it is still an enjoyable way to waste a couple of hours. The story is still the same basic concept as the original ? a police precinct, number 13, is being shut down. It is the final night there, and only a few staff are present, when a crime boss is brought in, and the building ends up attacked. The difference this time is that the protagonists are not gangers trying to free their boss, but corrupt cops trying to kill him. What unfolds on screen is a typical Hollywood action film, and could very well be referred to as Die Hard in a Police Station.Lacking the brutal edge of the original, and feeling glossier, this isn't always a bad thing as some of the camera work and style play well, from the grainy texture of the opening scenes, to the skewed camera set ups. The action is tense and well framed, allowing the film to do exactly what you expect from this kind of film. That is, entertain. The overall average nature of the remake is brought up a grade or two by the presence of Lawrence Fishburne as the crime boss, Bishop, Ethan Hawke as the cop (Jake), and Gabriel Byrne as the bad cop (Duvall), who all give decent enough performances.In general this is a solid actioner, which may not be totally original, nor is it a patch on the 1976 version, but is good enough entertainment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I should make a clear statement before I leave my peace with this movie. I am a HUGE fan of the original AOP13 and have been an avid fan since I was 8 years old and saw it on Cinemax back in 1980. Now, with that out of the way, my opinion of the remake. I felt the dialog was awful, the editing was horrendous and the characters I just could care less if they lived or died. I didn't give two s***s about them. I sat there wondering what in the world they were thinking while this movie was made! That a studio actually said "oh yeah, that's a great idea, let green light this" and that a director at some point said "great acting, that's a wrap". UGHHHH. I rarely give movies 1 star out of 10. This one deserves a zero rating. Absolute crap. Can anyone please explain to me how in the movie it's snowing on one side of the building and not on the other?? Helloooooo!!! Editing!!! Where are you?? And what in the hell was the last 20 minutes doing in a forest????? WHA?? Long live the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Assaults on This One</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Okay before I do the typical thing of comparing this film to the original one, I will pretend as if I did not see the latter. The whole concept is pretty cool if you think about it--a bad-butt gangster and some other inmates having to team up with cops against dirty cops. The thing about the film is that I did not feel any of the characters. I did not bond with them. Byrne is a good actor, but the bad guy he plays here is just some dirty cop who we only see as a man wanting to break into the precinct to get the gangster with whom he used to work. Hawke plays a troubled cop who we really don't come to care about--we only see him as the good guy. The reason we do not want him to die is so that the bad guys don't get what they want. And that is when we move to Fishburne's character--he's a cool guy (the best one in the film) as he's calm about a lot, but does not convince us fully that he's a cop-killer. We only see him as the tough one. Anyway, aside from that, I would have found the movie to be watchable and fair if I had not seen the original. But since I have, I am going to say that obviously Carpenter's is the better one. I was more involved with the first one, and although I got into this one a little, it was not enough for me to be on the edge of my seat. Napoleon the gangster in the first Assault was cool, funny, and interesting while Bishop the gangster here is pretty dry. The events are pretty much the same except that this was more action-packed. And I MUST say that I was a bit disappointed with the fact that you did not feel the respect that much between the gangster and the cop while in the original you did. Here it makes you think as if the gangster is just fighting because he hates the ones outside the precinct and he just does not care for anything else; in the first Assault, the gangster fights for his life and you sense the respect he and the cop gain for each other. I guess this would have been better if that would have been added. Well, onward to the good stuff now. The setting is nice, the action is good, and the movie is interesting enough to watch. Yes, I delivered a few assaults on this film, but it was fair overall. It keeps you watching and waiting for what is going to happen next, even if you think you know. You just want to see HOW it happens. You can go see this in the theatres if you really want to see a more action-packed remake of the original film, or you can wait for it on video to sit back and enjoy. It is not the best movie, but it is somewhat worthy =)6.3/10 Stars</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK so this is a remake. That figures. Hollywood cant come up with original ideas so they go and do another remake and do a horrible job doing it to. They should try to come up with there own ideas a little more. It can't be much worse than this was.So what was wrong with this movie. Personally i would say everything. The actors they used should stay out of the picture like they have been. I didn't even know some of the people were still around acting till i saw them in this movie. None of the characters had any chemistry what so ever. Dennehy was complete predictable. I knew he had to be the mole in the movie almost the minute the damn movie started. But of course they have to go and blame another person half way thru the movie. Maybe it would have been a better movie if they all had died. Then there would have been a little satisfaction&gt; I definitely would not recommend going to the theatres to see this movie. Wait for it to come out on rental and you have nothing else to watch. Thats about all this movie is worth. 3 out of 10 is all i would give it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>this remake is NOT a beautiful and unique snowflake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...it's actually remarkably, frustratingly average.Imagine if a respected independent director, used to low budgets and developed characters, were drafted by a major studio with deep pockets to direct an action film, it would probably come out looking something like this dull, pedestrian remake of John Carpenter's siege epic: Lots of talk, lots of loopy camera angles (to symbolize 'creativity' as the helicopter blades go 'round), and lots of art-directed death scenes (blood darkening white snow after a bullet to the head, for instance).The original "Assualt" was lowdown and gritty, suspenseful and funny, visceral and well-developed. "Assault 2005" is clichéd and conventional, manufactured and maudlin, well-acted but weak...(I could go on). It's yet another instance (after "Dawn of the Dead" and "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre") of remake "Title-itis," where a familiar name is obtained in order to break something that didn't need fixed in the first place (and of course make some money off of an ignorant public).Director Jean-Francois Richet doesn't show much competency toward the craft (yes, I said 'craft') of wide-release action films. The movie is a clumsy mix of exposition scenes that stretch on far too long (the clichéd characters don't need as much justification as they are given) interspersed with action that simply isn't very thrilling (perhaps because the aforementioned approach is so banal); add to this frantic edits that often render the action incoherent and you might find yourself being lulled into Slumberland (I kept wondering if I had just had too long a day as I sat in my seat)...Ethan Hawke gamely leads the way through this blizzard of problems, but without much help from the stereotypical supporting players: John Leguizamo as a wisecracking speed freak; Ja Rule as a con who refers to himself in the third person; Maria Bello as a psychiatrist who recites multiplication tables in times of panic; Gabriel Byrne as the steely, one-dimensional villain. Laurence Fishburne plays opposite Hawke as a crime lord who loves crossword puzzles; he's rather out of place in the role, never once coming "alive" to maybe lend some reality to the proceedings (not that anything in "Assault 2005" is grounded in reality), seemingly stuck in perpetual Morpheus-Mode.Even in the lowliest guilty pleasures served up by the Jerry Bruckheimer camp, you can usually find some nugget of enjoyment that numbs you like a vapid television show for a few hours. "Assault 2005" shoots for that hoop whilst trying to tease us with some sour brain candy, but seems so self-consciously aware of its own shallow objectives that it drains any possible entertainment value from the proceedings. We've been there, and done that(and better, besides)...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much blood shed in efficient remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Laurence Fishburne (playing a career criminal) anchors this efficiently directed action thriller that slickens up John Carpenter's raw-edged original. From the opening flashback in which cop Ethan Hawke's psychological "dilemma" is presented, the narrative rocks along at a brisk clip and much blood is shed You watch a film like this for the violent action. The simple set-up provides plenty and it is very well handled. Director Richet keeps the tension tight and the implausibilities minimal. The cops assaulting the cops (and crims) in the thirteenth precinct are presented (mostly) as faceless killing machines captained by the expressionless but believable Gabriel Byrne.Final confrontation in a pine forest at night is atmospherically staged with plenty of flair and professionalism.The film's effectiveness must be attributed in no small part to a screenplay that injects some decent characterization into the action and is not reluctant to do away (in grisly fashion) with key supporting actors.Nothing amazing, but nothing wrong-footed, either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great action flick, a good one. Go see it if you haven't already!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the best action movies I've seen in a while (yeah i don't watch a lot of movies but take my word for it) It has a nice balance of plot, action, and even a little bit of comedy thrown in. It has a great layered plot that opens gradually and very nicely with twists at every turn. The action sequences are very well done, with lots of creative solutions to situations used by Hawke, Fishburne and others. John Leguizamo and Ja Rule (and even Laurence Fishburne in a couple instances ) provide comic relief during the movie with their... "interesting" characters and funny one-liners. My friend managed to predict where the plot would move several times during the movie though, so I think that while i was bamboozled with the desired effect, their plot-twists may not be enough for everyone. Also, another complaint, while more aesthetic was the lack of variety in deaths. It seems like any time anybody took a bullet, they were shot in the head and a small trickle of blood came down. Yes, I know that today's weaponry provides the opportunity for pinpoint accuracy and that the center of the forehead is as good a target as any, but mixing up the shooting deaths could've been a small aesthetic improvement. Overall, it's a great movie and I'd recommend it to just about anybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun update of a classic B-movie, lacking the original's vibe but still awesome</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When remaking a movie that is considered a classic, even if it's a lesser one, the filmmakers face an uphill battle to appease the fans of the original while winning over new converts, bringing something new to the story while honoring the first film."Assault on Precinct 13," a remake of the 1976 John Carpenter film of the same name, manages to do just that, giving some new life to the tale, although it does not supersede the original.It's New Year's Eve in Detroit, and during the middle of a snowstorm the Precinct 13 police station is gearing up for its last night before shutting down forever. Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke), a burnt-out cop still feeling guilty for the deaths of two fellow officers during a sting operation, is watching over the dilapidated station, located in a rundown industrial area. He is assisted by fellow officer Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy) and secretary Iris Ferry (Drea de Matteo). Also on hand is Roenick's court appointed psychologist Alex Sabian (Maria Bello), caught in the storm after their session.However, their routine night becomes complicated when a bus transporting prisoners is forced to take shelter at the station. Aboard are drug addict Beck (John Leguisamo), gang member Anna (Aisha Hinds), scam artist Smiley (Ja Rule), and worst of all, notorious murderer and crime boss Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne).Inconvenience becomes terror. Bishop is a former crime partner with crooked police officer Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne). Duvall, fearing that Bishop will drop dime on him to the prosecutor, plans to have him killed. In order to get to Bishop, he has to go through the people inside. Deciding no witnesses is the best policy, Duvall orders his men to storm the station and wipe out everyone. Faced with the reality that they're all targets, the police, criminals and civilians inside Precinct 13 decide to work together to ward off the invading force."Assault" manages to be an action packed B-movie as well as being suspenseful, and features quite a few likable characters placed in a melting pot about to explode. However, for every thing the movie does to improve on the original there are an equal number of things that act as a detriment.Director Jean-François Richet, making his American film debut, manages to nicely invoke Carpenter's gritty claustrophobia and cranks up the action to full-scale war at times, with a few brutal deaths to shock audiences. He directs with remarkable economy, using tight shots and unnerving silence to focus on the despair. He also effectively uses the winter setting, which gives the movie a desolate and foreboding feel that seems like a nod to another Carpenter film, "The Thing."The acting department helps liven things up as well. Hawke manages to take a routine character and invest personality into him, showing his chops as a leader in a difficult situation. Indie star Bello and "Sopranos" alum de Matteo aren't "damsels in distress," and play their roles with a nice touch of conviction. Dennehy is less realized but is an accomplished enough performer that he gets the job done.The real star here is Fishburne, who brings a Zen-like calmness to his character Bishop, honed from his work in the "Matrix" movies. He's smooth on the surface but a caged lion underneath, and commands attention in every scene. Byrne seems to be channeling his character from "The Usual Suspects," and does no wrong here. The only real fifth wheel here is Ja Rule and Leguisamo, providing the movie's odious comedy relief. To their credit though, they're not as annoying as they could have been.Where "Assault" missteps is in its modernization of the attackers. In the original movie, the invaders were a nearly mindless, suicidal street gang. Here the attackers are an efficient paramilitary force, which really makes the possibility of the victims surviving a little ludicrous. But the film doesn't discount reality too much, and there is a genuine feeling of uncertainty here over who will and won't survive.The violence is also genuinely shocking and harsh, the producers choosing to aim for a "hard R" rating. It catches you off guard, and doesn't play deaths just for thrills. It also gives extra weight to some of the kills, which is a rarity for most action movies these days.Odds are, this new version won't be well-remembered 30 years later, but it still manages to be an entertaining diversion. The only unforgivable sin committed here is leaving out the original's synthesized theme song. It's enough to make me want to storm the fort as well.Eight out of ten stars. What the movie lacks in originality and sometimes believability, it makes up for with interesting characters and a genuine desire to shock and entertain the audience, all of which sets it apart from most studio output.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I did not intend to see this movie. In fact, the title actually put me off- "Another hair-brain action flick", I thought...Well, I was wrong. If you want to see a good action movie, that successfully establishes an enticing inciting incident (being stuck at the old precinct and under siege), with engaging characters and moves along at a consistent pace, this is a good bet.Hawke does good things with his characters' battle to regain confidence in himself and Fishbourne turns in a credible show as Morpheus-gone-bad: could we be in line for a sequel? There is a degree of licence in the plot (why don't we learn the lessons of 'Nam, eh? A big old army doesn't equal victory, people!),but those are flaws of the action genre and crucially, didn't affect my viewing at the time.As one unfamiliar with the original, I sum it up as good, kick-ass fun.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would happen, you ask yourself, if someone had the temerity to take a (more or less contemporary) classic and eviscerate it; take from it all that made it a classic in the first place? Well, here's your answer. John Carpenter's (more or less) contemporary "western" had a lot going for it (I refer you to my comments regarding same elsewhere on the IMDb). The remakers dispensed with all that. What we're left with is a feature length television cop show. If anyone involved in this debacle had anything even remotely creative to say, one could forgive them the paucity of their talent. Unfortunately, they have absolutely nothing to say- and they say it badly, for all that. If paying to watch TV on the Big Screen is your idea of a night out at the movies, you're easier to please than I am (or will ever be).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very mediocre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie more or less conformed to my expectations: it wasn't terrible, but it was a forgettable and inferior remake of the John Carpenter original. The action scenes, aside from some strong sequences in the beginning, seemed somewhat predictable and tepid, without the sort of intensity the best parts of the original had. More importantly, the change in premise made the story less interesting. In the original, the bad guys are gang members prepared to fight to the death for revenge against the police, and the movie makes no attempt to give them any humanity--none of them even have any speaking lines, except one word. They are a faceless force of evil like the monsters in "Aliens" or "Night of the Living Dead," or the Indians in a Western. In this, the bad guys are crooked cops, and the filmmakers actually try to give them humanity and characterization. This was meant to make the villains more believable, I think, but it just falls flat and makes them seem indecisive and less menacing. Also, Ethan Hawke's character of Jake Roenick is much less interesting than the police officer, Ethan Bishop, in the original, and Morpheus---I mean, Lawrence Fishburne--is not as memorable or believable as the mass murderer-turned-ally in John Carpenter's version. Overall, worth seeing for comparison to the first one, but nothing special. A good alternative is the French movie "The Nest," which has a similar plot and captures the spirit of the original "Assault" much better.</fullReview>

Despite the usual pyrotechnics and some clever expositions the cookie-cutter characters are unevenly divvied out by screenwriter James DeMonaco and director Jean-Francois Richet (in his American debut) doesn't keep the attention span from evaporating into a scattershot formulaic mess. A feral Hawke as a police sergeant seeking personal redemption keeps things cooking with a solid performance allowing some nice shadings as the reluctant gatekeeper and Bello is equally fine as the psychiatrist who ultimately believes in him; Fishburne is at his most concrete bad-ass and da Matteo her sexiest as the tough-talking' receptionist.</fullReview>

I'm going to guess the two above mentioned actors were either doing this movie for someone as a favor or just needed something to do until something else became available.

The star is having a mental conflict dealing with his situation on the police force. You can tell this by the facial contortions he is making, or it could be indigestion. The old wise cop comes in and says, "You Okay." What virtuoso writing! I was compelled to listen to the cliché reply and was intrigued as to what further deep conversation would reveal. Any appeal to this movie would be in the effects and violence. There were lots of weapons and killings and if you like this kind of crap you would be entertained by most of the movie.

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13, I learned, is a remake of a remake....interesting. This is in no means the perfect action film, it's filled with modern action movie clichés and such, but its still enjoyable. One thing I like is how it cuts right to the chase and doesn't let up. I would've liked a little more back story into some of the characters, Gabrielle Byrne's (we don't really get any on him) &amp; Fishburne's in particular. As far as acting goes, Ethan Hawke was pretty good; it's pretty obvious he pulled a lot from his Oscar nominated Training Day performance. Fishburne is Fishburne as usual, as cool as he wanna be...I loved his look. I was glad he lived in the end. The plot twist towards the end with Dennehy wasn't a big surprise; one could easily figure it out by deducing characters' involvement as the film goes on, if they don't die. The body count in AOP13 is kind of high; I must admit I expected more of the core characters to live, but hey, it made things more interesting.I was entertained without being disgusted; there are flaws of course, but none glaring enough to drag the film down to 'utter crap' status. You'll enjoy yourself with this film; overall it's well done.*** out of **** stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Action-Filled Movie In A Usually Dreary January</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>January, known mostly for dumping the left over films form studios, actually came through with a surprise filled, good time at the movies with Assault on Precinct 13, a B list film filled with A-list stars.The plot of this film follows Ethan Hawk and LAwrence Fishbourne, a cop and a criminal respectively, as they try to fend off crooked cops trying to kill Fishbourne due to his knowledge of the corruption within the police department. Hawk, battling his own personal demons from a botched up undercover assignment from eight months ago, is dragged into the situation when Bishop is brought to his Precinct due to bad weather. What follows is an action packed, mostly realistic flick pulsing with intensity and bad ass moments.Seriously, watching this film, one can not doubt the power of Lawrence Fishbourne who plays gangster Marion Bishop, a cop killer who is partnered secretly with the police chief. He is caught killing police officers however, and risks exposing the whole charade unless he is killed first. Throughout the film, Bishop is cool, collected, and seemingly always in control of the chaos that is going on around him. he delivers catchy one liners, and is believable as the villain turned hero.Ethan Hawke, however, stole the film with his portrayal of Jake Roenick. His performance was completely full of awesome moments, starting with his botched drug bust and continuing to the tense finale. He is always at odds with Bishop, yet being forced to work together, they are able to hold off the assailants as long as they can.Supporting characters in this film really added the comedic tone that was needed to turn this flick into an enjoyable romp. John Leguizamo especially turned in a great performance, bringing a silliness and anxiety to the film that turned it into not just an action film, but a sarcastic one at that. Ja Rule wasn't too bad, though it was an advantage that he didn't really have much to say besides agreeing with the people around him.There are a few plot points in Assault on Precinct 13 that are pretty, well, unrealistic (example how did a forrest turn up in the middle of Chicago?), but over all, it is a great action filled flick to pass the usual dreary month of January if you are willing to just go with it. This is not a film for everyone however, for some the action might be a little too intense for the more sensitive viewers. To the others, enjoy, it is worth the price of admission at least.Recommended MJR</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believability should be a strong prerequisite in a suspense/thriller. Duh!! I had such high hopes for this flick and it simply fell off the table. Grant you, I've enjoyed many a movie (example/Die Hard Trilogy) that stretched the realism balloon but never to this preposterous degree. An entire city is dead or off in the twilight zone while the war goes on at this #13 Precinct in Detroit. Duh!! With the high caliber talent that was brought together for this remake I was annoyed that the script and storyline seemed so shallow. Some of the characters that could have given substance to the plot and/or story just were so less than even cliché. This movie could have been so much more than the bland TV melodrama that it seemed to be. On a plus note, Fishburne and Hawke did manage to save this from the total disaster that it could have been. I'm glad I saw "Million Dollar Baby" that showed me there is hope for Hollywood yet. Characters with a whole-lotta substance.</fullReview>

It didn't have any slow dragging parts to it. There was action from the minute it started to the minute it ended. I really am a fan of the director, Jean-François Richet. I really like his style. the acting was great. When you have a cast like Lawrence Fishburne and Ethan Hawke, you know you have good start. Then, Drea De Matteo, John L, Ja Rule. I loved the film! It was well done, very exciting, and the plot twists made it a lot of fun. Besides, with Lawrence Fishburne as the bad, how could you really go wrong!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing overall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a remake, this was fairly well done. The acting was better than the plot/character development. There was definitely more flash than substance. The overall concept is far-fetched as there's no way so many police officers, even corrupt ones, would turn against their own so quickly &amp; uniformly. Things fit together a bit too well. The same objective could have been successful by using a three or four persons instead of some blindly loyal army of corrupt cops. I did, however, enjoy Laurence Fishbourne and Ethan Hawke. Seems IL' Ethan has learned quite a bit since "Training Days"! On of those noticeable gaffs was the inmate transport bus that had burned most of the night yet somehow still had snow on top of it. I also didn't realize there was so much wooded area around the Detroit industrial parks. Hmmm.... Some viewers are troubled by cops becoming the antagonists and a bad guy almost becoming the protagonist. To me, I can see how corruption can grow like a cancer when left unchecked and how power/greed can divide even a police force. Innocent victims get caught in the crossfire. Though the corruption in this movie seems a bit too widespread and the overall plan too extreme, I could see where corrupt officers would see blaming an enemy force for the death of a few innocents to protect themselves would be very logical. I'd recommend this more as a $3 video/DVD rental than an $8 movie. It will reduce well to the small screen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After reading all the glowing reviews for this movie, i was expecting a fun trip to the movies. But unfortunately, it turned out to be your standard no-brains, boring, run-of-the-mill excuse for entertainment. You never care for the characters, so the deaths are meaningless. Of course I wasn't surprised at this, so I was hoping for some creative and thrilling deaths. Another let down. Pretty much everyone gets shot in the head. Or, in one scene, stabbed in the head. I counted about eight instances of this. There is no tension, no humor that works, and the acting is pretty much embarrassing. Ethan Hawke and Lawrence Fishburne scowl and half-smirk their way through the picture. And then there's the cringe-inducing John Leguizamo, the lame Ja Rule, and the female gangbanger (who at one point actually says: What the . . . funk? ugggh). These wastes-of-celluloid live for way too long. And the entire sewer-twist towards the end makes absolutely no sense whatsoever. The character could've revealed the sewer tunnel before any bullets began to fly, saving us all of two hours of mindless violence, psychologically-inept dialogue, and lame deaths. Lame, lame, lame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It seems ridiculous to say, but I liked this movie because you couldn't predict the order of deaths. That sounds like something a 15-year-old would write, but here it manages to apply: You can't base the order of deaths on the level of fame the actor has achieved, or what order the names appear in the credits. Nobody spouts any glib one-liners after a kill. Death comes fast and without mercy, albeit to a number of faceless Kevlar-clad dirty cops.Who dies? I think what the filmmakers were gunning for (no pun intended, maybe) was a character study, which is hit or miss (sorry) when exactly one character is given any depth whatsoever. The shrink gets a few lines here and there, as does the "female gang-banger who swears she never committed a crime," but beyond that, they're all set-pieces with loose descriptions.Just the same, death doesn't happen for no reason; every death of a "good guy" comes with a lingering shot of their body, as if to say, "Think about what got this person here." I wouldn't exactly call this a morality play, but you can make the choice to leave your brain on or off for this one. It doesn't work 100% both ways, but close enough.Details: Fishburne and Hawke are damn good, at least with the material given. Fishburne is given too little to play, but crafts nice little details between the lines; I wanted more of his life, how he found his way into it, and how this fits into the Detroit crime world, a very real entity that this movie ignores entirely. It could have been any city, USA... or Canada, showing the filmmakers didn't care, either (the movie was shot in Toronto). Meanwhile, Hawke has an intense scene to open the film, the prologue in which he's an undercover cop. The thing is, if this is a skill he has, why does he never again use it for the remainder of the film? The plot is based on his problem with leadership and decision-making, but even as he starts to deal with that, this other key aspect of his character is forgotten, or at least underutilized to the point I didn't notice it again.Every other actor tears into their limited screen time with gusto, leaving a lasting impression, with the exception of bad singer turned bad actor Ja Rule. His every line is delivered like it's being recited in a junior high school play, even if the lines on the page were originally meant to be funny. The (occasionally) stylized direction from Jean-Francoise Richet does its best to cover "Rule's" presence, but can't eliminate it entirely. And while JR's presence isn't enough to ruin the film, it does turn it into a sexy sports car with a big freakin' dent in the fender.Looking at screenwriter James DeMonaco's credits, I wasn't initially optimistic about this film, but I knew that Fishburne and Hawke regularly chose interesting character roles. The story isn't much to speak of, though it IS a remake... the character study slightly shallow, but you can only slow down an action movie so much. I feel like a brat calling a movie like this "realistic," but hey man, sometimes violence just goes down that way. Even if the people who usually do it are a little more well-drawn.8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best remakes of the decade</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is one of overrated horror director John Carpenter's few successful films and while, like most of the rest of his directorial credits, I don't love it; it's still a good film. Like most people, the news that it was being remade wasn't regarded as good news by me; until, of course, I saw the remake and found out that it's actually very good! While I like the seventies low budget style of the original, the film always seemed like what the story needed was massively outweighed by the budget restraints, and so the film always felt more than a little short to me. This remake has got rid of that problem, Hollywood style; with a big budget! Usually, this would annoy me; but really, the idea of a gang terrorising the inhabitants of a police station requires a big budget in order to work effectively. This is a story that needs all the explosions, stunts and action that only a big budget can provide. And the big budget certainly does provide all of the above! Any whisper of Night of the Living Dead-style horror that the first film had has been taken out of Assault on Precinct 13 2005, and the film is action all the way. No bad thing in my opinion.The remake has kept the simple police station under fire plotting that made the original film so enjoyable, but typically for Hollywood, some things have been fleshed out. Another thing that the original fell short on was character, and it was hard to really care for any of them. While the development here isn't exactly Shakespeare, a definite effort has been made to get us behind the characters, and it helps the film immensely. Ethan Hawke, aside from his turn in the excellent Before Sunrise, isn't an actor that I rate very highly; but his personality manages to bring great appeal to his police sergeant character, and at times such as the "I don't know" moment, the audience is really allowed to get behind him. Another thing that is made best use of is Lawrence Fishburne's imposing figure. He looks great as the master criminal, and although his shoulder padding is overdone; he looks cool throughout. It has become customary with remakes to go in expecting the worst, but as films such as 2003's The Texas Chainsaw Massacre have proved (not 2004's Dawn of the Dead, though); remakes aren't always poorer versions of the original. I'll probably burn in hell for saying so, but this film belongs to the rare 'remakes better than the original' group of films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just actually discovered that Assault was a remake of a John Carpenter film...I had no idea...and I love Carpenter. Nonetheless I had seen no previews and had no idea what the film was about but went just for something different. Something different doesn't exactly describe this film. It's more of the same and run of the mill as far as action films go although I was pleased to see it was not PG'd to death and held it's own as a gory, violent action flick for adults. The plot is far from new and it's step by step rehash which I admit is getting a little old. Terrorists, small group of people, fighting back, everyone dying except two etc. etc. etc. Nowadays it's hard to find a good, original concept in film so we have to deal with same old, same old which can still leave you satisfied as does this film.Assault is the story of a cop who was in charge of an undercover mission that ended with the death of his team. Ashamed and guilt driven he hides behind a desk for the next couple of years over seeing a run down, off the heat precinct with some over the hill cops that never see the action. The Precinct is now being closed up and the cops are being sent out to various other departments. It's the final hours before they close up shop on New Years Eve and due to a brutal storm a bus-load of small time criminals are forced to be kept at the Precinct under the watch of the cop played by Ethan Hawke. Unfortunately on board the bus is also a big time mob boss accused of killing a cop, and suddenly the Precinct is under heavy attack and they learn the terrorists outside are wanting to assassinate the mob boss played by Lawrence Fishburn. Stranded inside the precinct is a cop Psychologist, Hawke's character, a the bus driver, and the other cops working in Precinct 13. Hawke's guilt kicks him into protective mode and he is determined not let anyone else die under his watch. A secret plot involving dirty cops is uncovered and action fills the rest.Because I said the plot of this film is more of the same I must explain what makes this movie the amazing film that it is...besides the action. If not for these two things, these movie would be outright boring and basically suck. First off...the cast...the actors in this film bring to life such a unique group of characters that it's just amazing. Hawke, who I am not always fond of, plays the angry, torn, and internally furious Jake Roenick. His character is deep and interesting. Maria Bello as the seemingly composed Psychologist puts depth and realism into her character. Lawrence Fishburn is amazing as the anti hero, larger than life Marion Bishop and him and Hawke make the best enemies forced to be partners ever. The rest of the minor cast including Ja Rule, and the barely recognizable John Leguizamo are amazing character actors that put some amazing depth into their minor characters. These characters all have their own issues, agenda's, reasoning, and lives and it manages to come through in the film. Not only the actors bring this to life but the amazing direction of Jean-François Richet. This film is beautifully directed, with it's snow falling scenes and it's dark, gritty atmosphere right to the end battles across a snow fallen forest. It's poetic and beautiful considering this to be a violent action film. All in all...these things over shadow the same old plot line making it a worthy film and one of the best action films I have seen in years. This one is a definite film to see!!! 9/10 Big shout out to my beautiful girl Sam who went to see it with me</fullReview>

You get non-stop mayhem with a lot of unexpected twists. I actually watched it twice in a row (I have never done that with a movie before).

		<shortDescription>Thirteen Is Your Lucky Number for This Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only thing worse than a sequel is a remake. Indeed, the odds against making a movie remake that tops the original are at best astronomical. At least, in a sequel, you have a fair idea what to expect, but a remake can alter everything. Anybody remember that awful 2003 remake of Tobe Hooper's scary "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre?" How about Tim Burton's rehash of "Planet of the Apes?" The Marlon Brando remake of the 1935 Clark Gable classic "Mutiny on the Bounty" remains an all-time sinker of a remake.Sometimes, however, lightning strikes. The 1959 Lana Turner version of the weepy "Imitation of Life" surpasses the 1934 Claudette Colbert original. The Mel Gibson thriller "Payback" held its own against the tough-minded Lee Marvin original "Point Blank" (1967). The 1925 silent film "Ben-Hur" remains a powerful movie in its own right, but the sound version with Charlton Heston overshadows it. Although it flopped at the box office, the recent remake of "Willard" is far more effective than the 1971 original. Similarly, frightening as George A. Romeo's "Dawn of the Dead" (1979) is, the grisly remake carved out a niche of its own, worthy of its predecessor.French director Jean-Francois Richet's new crime thriller "Assault on Precinct 13" (*** out of ****) amounts to a hard-boiled, adrenalin-laced, high-octane remake of "Halloween" director John Carpenter's modest but imaginative 1976 original. Carpenter made his movie on an estimated $100-thousand budget without a celebrity cast, and the plot was straightforward but white-knuckled. Essentially, Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" constituted an inner city spin on Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo," the venerable John Wayne &amp; Dean Martin western. Whereas Carpenter's "Assault" clocked in at 91 lean, mean, trim minutes, the $30-million "Assault" remake runs 109 minutes. The story is essentially the same in both epics, only the characters and the intensity of the fireworks have been changed to keep pace with today's standards.As remakes go, "Assault on Precinct 13" outstrips the Carpenter film on virtually every count, except originality?which isn't saying much given its derivative predecessor. In his first English-language film, director Jean-Francois Richet has assembled a convincing cast featuring Oscar winning actor Ethan Hawke, "Matrix" superstar Laurence Fishburne, "The Usual Suspects'" Gabriel Byrne, Brian Dennehy of "Silverado," and John Leguizamo of "Executive Decision." The new "Assault on Precinct 13" ramps up the violence considerably, though no kids are shot in the face through an ice-cream cone as in the Carpenter original. When the gunplay erupts in this grim, claustrophobic thriller, you might have to stuff popcorn in your ears. Every shot registers like an artillery barrage. Of course, the script by James DeMonaco of "The Negotiator" consists of clichés and conventions with stereotypical characters in abundance. However, DeMonaco endows these cornered characters with far more depth than Carpenter did.The action in the "Assault" remake unfolds in snowy Detroit instead of sunny Los Angeles. Ostensibly, Carpenter's "Assault" weighed in as an exercise in spartan suspense, while Richet's remake is a big-budget, no-holds-barred, blow-the-top-of-your-head-off, melodrama. Eight months after getting shot in the leg in a drug-bust-gone-bad that claims the lives of two other cops, Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke of "Training Day") is popping painkillers and keeping a low profile as the desk sergeant at Precinct 13. As it turns out, the city is shutting down Precinct 13 for good, and Jake and a skeleton crew are stuck inside its dilapidated premises during a blinding snowstorm on New Year's Eve. Meanwhile, the Detroit police have arrested a notorious mobster, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), and an army of crooked cops led by the nefarious Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne) want to terminate him with extreme prejudice so that he cannot sing like a canary to the grand jury. In the Carpenter original, gang members with silencers on their guns besieged the cops. Here, every corrupt cop in Detroit shows up for sniper duty to for target practice. Indeed, these gimlet-eyed snipers have a bad habit of missing more often than hitting their marks. Unless you stand stock still in the "Assault" remake, you have a better-than-average chance of survival. Of course, the villains are always terrible marksmen; otherwise they'd mow down the heroes and ruin the ending. Nevertheless, if either the good guys or the bad guys have you covered within an arm's length, you can expect to see exploding brains in the tradition of "Pulp Fiction." If you cannot stand the sight of blood, avoid this blood drenched remake. DeMarco's script dawdles in the middle and doesn't spring any eye-opening surprises. The surprise ending, however, comes as quite a revelation, considering the guy that gets away is as amoral as they come. The least believable surprise gets our heroes out of danger long enough to land them right back into jeopardy. A suspenseful stalking scene in a nearby wooded area seems out of place, but Richet wrings every ounce of tension from it that he can. As a director, Richet is cut from the same cloth as his French compatriot Luc Besson who helmed the trigger-happy "Le Femme Nitika" and "Leon, The Professional." Richet pours on the fusillades of gunfire when the characters don't pause to discuss their next move. You've seen this movie a zillion times if you watch westerns. Basically, the dirty cops stand in for the screaming Apaches that ride circles around the wagon train. Richet achieves a frenetic, life-on-the-raw-edge quality with his shaky camera treatment of the opening scene. This guy definitely knows how to stage action scenes with energy and flair.Reportedly, even Carpenter liked DeMarco's screenplay, and Richet consulted him about his bullet-blasting update. Altogether, "Assault on Precinct 13" emerges as a well-done remake that will make a reputation for itself without endangering the original's cult status.</fullReview>

In this new version, the tension is high and we get to know the main protagonists better. Thus, we care more about their fate. Even the villains are more believable. I was getting quite tired of movies featuring super villains with one side to their personalities. Yes it's very violent and not for you grandma. It's gritty and sometimes humorous.

		<fullReview>ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 contains a lot of laughs for a cop-action film; that was a surprise. It also has a terrific, bleak winter feel. The precinct could just as well be on the moon. There were enough hand-held shots to give it the occasional documentary feel, but not so many that it became annoying and headache-inducing. Hawke turns in a competent, not particularly flashy performance as the police sergeant down on his luck; and the supporting actors -- including especially a cool and controlled Fishburne and an over-the-top Leguizamo -- are solid. This is the kind of sandpaper-rough action flick that used to be made in the 1970s (think THE SEVEN UPS) but has been virtually extinguished because of Hollywood's propensity for comic-book schmaltz (think DIE HARD). Whatever its faults, ASSAULT and its French director deserve praise for providing 2005's grown-up action flick. (And thanks to David Mamet for last year's, SPARTAN.) Could the 70s be coming back? We can hope.</fullReview>

It is full of great action packed moments that keep you guessing. There is a lot of violence and a good bit of blood, but nothing too gross. Ethan Hawke did a good job with his character, the police captain that must keep everyone's head on straight while the jail house is under attack. Brian Dennehy always plays his part well. I don't think I've ever seen him do anything I didn't like. I have never been a fan of John Leguisamo, and I'm still not. Laurence Fishburne plays the main character as far as the bad guys go. His character's best action comes near the end but its worth waiting for. And then there's Maria Bello, what a nice piece of eye candy for this movie. ( Most may remember her from Coyote Ugly).I was very pleased with this movie and I believe most people that like action movies will be pleased also. I never felt bored, never got tired of looking at Maria and never had to glance at my watch to see if it was finally going to end. I give it a 6.8 on my scale of 1-10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is one of the better remakes I have seen. It doesn't outdo the original, like The Italian Job did, but it is a good way to spend 2 hours of your time. The movie is, in essence, a modern day western with the good guys trapped by the bad guys in a police station. It contains every cliché in the book, such as the cop who drinks because he lost his partners in a failed drug bust and the old cop who say he is going to retire (you immediately know what this guy's fate is going to be). The movie does keep the suspense going and the action scenes are quite good. Unfortunately, the last third of the movie is disappointing. Too many of the characters are killed and their absence at the end is missed. The performances, particularly Laurence Fishurne (finally free from those awful Matrix movies) and Ethan Hawke, are good. It is still not as good as the original, but this remake is a good time waster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) was a satisfying remake. Instead of trying to do a bad copy, the film makers decided to use the basic plot and structure of the original and build around it. The directing was up to snuff and he writing wasn't bad. Laurence Fishburne is a bad dude as Bishop, a no nonsense criminal who'll do what ever he can to survive. Ethan Hawke was adequate as Wilson, a cop who survived an incident when he went undercover. Drea de Matteo, Brian Dennehy and Gabriel Byrne (sans accent) also round out the stars of this show.I don't need to go into detail about the film because it's quite similar to the original (except a few updates, additions and a couple of minor sub plots).My biggest concern when this film came out was the rating. I was ever so glad when I learned it was going to receive an R-rating (boy, did they earn it!). The only thing that kept this movie from being near perfect was the pacing. If they trimmed a few minutes from the running time it could be an A, I'll have to give it an A-.Recommended for fans of action films. The blood and violence content is real high for a mainstream film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really solid remake....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So, I'm a John Carpenter fan and I really liked the original so I went out to see this movie thinking it was gonna be like most remakes: A really shoddy reinterpretation. But it's not. It actually takes the same stuff from the old film and sort of reworks it and updates it in a way that's really well organized and cohesive.First off: Action. I love action. This movie had some really intense action sequences and everyone was sort of in everyone else's face just like in the original. I thought that was cool and keeping with making it a good remake.The look of the film is great. It's really gritty and the film is kinda gory. But it's not too gory. It's no bloodbath.I also think Ja Rule was awesome in it. I haven't seen him in any other films and I wasn't really a fan until this movie. And I've always liked Lawrence fishburne. He was always awesome ever since Apocalypse Now and later in the Matrix.I definitely recommend ASSAULT. If you haven't seen it and you like edgy action packed stuff, you'll really dig this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter, Do You Forgive Such Heresy?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, viewers were surprised and astonished with the very credible low budget "John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13". The story of a deactivated precinct under siege by gangs of criminals was really scary and ahead of time, especially for those who lives in a Third World country like me, since it is not far from our recent reality.Jean-François Richet decided to spoil the credibility of the storyline and introduced weapons and bombs as if it was the invasion of Iraq, but in a city zone, and like the population was the "three monkeys" or "Tommy": nobody sees it, nobody hears it , nobody speaks of it. The point is, if the viewer shuts down the brain and forgets any possibility of reality, of course he will have a good entertainment, especially with the great group of actors and actresses in the cast. But this remake is a heresy with the magnificent original movie. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "Assalto ao 13o DP" ("Assault on Precinct 13")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A big time Gangster...gets incarcerated after killing a dirty cop...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has a great plot..very similar to the to original, however this version is very gory. The cast works well together, with extremely different personalities and backgrounds. The big snow storm that hits Detriot, sets up the plot very well. Lawrence Fishburne the big time gangster who gets incarcerated and has to spend New Years weekend in jail. They take him and the other prisoners on bus and transport them to another district. On the way the driver feels that the snow is coming down to hard so they have to take the prisoners to a closer cell. It just so happens that the only precinct in proximity is Precinct 13. Precinct 13 is being moved to a new building after the New Year because it is old. And because of that there are only a few officers there... pretty much saying their last good bye to the place the called home. This is where the majority of the movie takes place. The Sargent ( Ethan Hawke) is wonderful as usual. Mr. Fishburne plays the role of the gangster and he does a great job as well. In the beginning he does not do very much talking, but after a while he informs us on the situation. John Leguizamo is really funny and plays his role extremely well. And yes Ja rule "Smiley" is pretty funny as well, " Smile would like to know what'g going on".... Overall this movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK first let me say...I have not seen the original I'm just basing this on what I just saw, so I am not going to compare them. First off let me say this movie is probably the best movie made in the past year including 2004. The critics really don't give this movie the props that it deserves. "Assault on Precinct 13" keeps you on the edge of your seat, and believe me once you get there you don't want to move! This movie gives you everything, suspense, action, drama. It even made me laugh a little.Here is my short summery.... The movie takes place in a precinct that is going to close, there are only 3 people left in the precinct. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawk), Iris Ferry (Drea De Matteo) and Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy). As it turns out a bus full of 4 prisoners Smiley (Ja Rule), Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne), Beck (John Leguizamo) and a women prisoner I can't remember her name. A little while after Bishop arrives, the dirty cops (who he is going to rat out) arrive and all hell breaks loose. It's an all out fight to the end, I really don't want to tell anymore because I'm afraid I will ruin it for you guys who are reading this. Seriously everybody should see this movie it totally rocks and it is Definitely Oscar worthy. Both Hawke and Fishburne deliver awesome performances!! GO SEE IT!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finally a true action thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 Review by Marc Siuba During the long night of New Years Eve in Detroit, Marion Bishop is being taken to prison after finally being caught for murdering a cop. But a terrible snow storm sets in and it is too difficult for the bus to continue so they have to stay overnight at precinct 13 the buildings last night before closing the doors forever. Everything is fine until the New Year arrives with trouble breaking in the back door looking to silent Bishop before he gets to court and sends a group of dirty cops to prison. Officer Rosen (Kim Coates) walks in on the men who are going to execute Bishop and blows there plan brining everyone downstairs with there guns drawn. Everyone thinks its Bishops men until Jake Holloway (Peter Bryant) finds a badge outside near one of the bodies. Now that everyone knows what's really going on the small group of police officers and inmates have to join together and fight off the dirty cops that will do anything to keep there secret from leaving alive.I was surprised at how good this movie actually was. I enjoyed it because the cast portrayed very real and intense emotions and actions thought-out the entirety of the movie. Peter Bryant played Lieutenant Holloway a cop that is recovering from the lost of his team 8 months ago and is going to do that ever it takes so that will it not happen again. He is in charge of protecting the lives of everyone inside even if he has to arm the inmates. Laurence Fishburne plays a silent but deadly character, Marion Bishop a cop killing mobster who will put a whole police team behind bars if he gets to court. Fishburne uses some of Morpheus's (The Matrix) wisdom and kick ass personality to make Bishop a cut throat and very interesting character to watch. Everyone in the cast played there rolls to the fullest and helped to keep the movie progressing.The special effects of the movie made it so much more fun and exciting to watch. The camera angles and effects made me feel like I was right there in the action and had my heart racing and adrenalin pumping.Overall I give Assault on precinct 13 9 out of 10 for this action thriller. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys movies such as The Negotiator and S.W.A.T.Thank you for reading Marc Siuba A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault Is Amazing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was fortunate enough to get into a screening for this film before it opened. It was great. I saw the original a while back, and this is definitely an awesome remake. The actions scenes are great, and the actors in this are so good. Ethan Hawke, Drea de Matteo, and Laurence Fishburne are all perfect in their roles. Not to mention, I always think John Leguizamo is great. I'm also a big Ja Rule fan, and I think he transitioned seamlessly from musician to actor. I have seen him in other films, but he really shined in this one. A lot of musicians just try to be actors, but he really is an actor. I highly recommend that everyone sees this film. It was so good that I might even see it again now that it's in theaters.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big Boys Playing With Big Guns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not seen the original "Assault on Precinct 13" and couldn't remember its inspiration "Rio Bravo" so I approached it with an open mind.But then I had to fight back reminders of clichés from every other movie that this version imitates, from as far back as "Petrified Forest"and "Key Largo" to sci fi movies like "Outland" and "Pitch Black," and practically every horror movie ever made.I was attracted by fine actors like Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne claiming in TV interviews that this is really a character study. But no, this is their testosterone pay-back for having made sensitive movies like "Before Sunset" or Gabriel Byrne recently in "P.S." They can all barely contain the glint in their eyes for the fun they are having playing cops and robbers with staggering firepower.All the violence is way over the top and exaggerated. Jean-François Richet directs this as a 3-D video game - where a gun will do there's a semi-automatic; where a car crash will do, there's an explosion; where one Molotov cocktail will do there's two; where a fatal shot is fired, there's a close-up of blood dripping from a bullet hole in the forehead; where there's two women on the side of the law, the plot is stretched to put them into slinky outfits.But even accepting that it is aimed at pre-teen boys, despite its deserved R rating, that I should try to approach it as if I hadn't seen any other movies, the final scene just lost me -- there's an evergreen forest in Detroit? The directing tried to add to the suspense with skittering hand-held shots, but combined with Graeme Revell's bombastic music it all just adds to the feeling of being manipulated.There are a handful of good lines in the dialog, but the script preens them with repetition and then they get repeated again in the Kris One closing summary rap over Revell's music, that does work as a base.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gun-play is over the top</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During a snowstorm on New Year's Eve, a busload of criminals is dropped off at Precinct 13 on its last day of operation before the building is torn down. One prisoner on the bus was the Detroit mobster and cop-killer, Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishbourne). Police Sergeant Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) and Jasper (Brian Dennehy) are the only police officers left at Precinct 13. With only two police officers, Jake doesn't want them to be left at his precinct. But the blizzard has gotten too bad for them to go any further. There is an assault on Precinct 13, and at first, it looks like Bishop's men are trying to break him out of jail. But Jake discovers that the men outside the precinct are police officers instead. They are crooked cops that have been receiving payoffs from Bishop for years, and they want to kill Bishop before he can testify against them in court. The bad cops do not want to leave any witnesses, so they have decided to kill everyone in the precinct. To survive the night, Jake lets the prisoner out of the jail cells and gives them guns to protect themselves. If they don't band together and protect each other's backs, they will all die. This is an action packed movie that will keep your attention to the very end. Some of the gun-play may be over the top, but what do you expect from a shoot-em-up movie? (Rogue Pictures, Run time 1:49, Rated R) (7/10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of a cult John Carpenter film, the critics give the original four out of five stars, and this three, but I would obviously need to see the original to compare. Basically inside a police station at Precinct 13, due to be closed for good soon, it is New Year's Eve, and just after the clock has struck midnight (for 2005), the station is soon under siege from masked gunmen. Sgt. Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) as well as everyone inside, including Dr. Alex Sabian (Maria Bello), Iris Ferry (Drea De Matteo), Officer Kevin Capra (Matt Craven) and Sgt. Jasper O'Shea (Brian Dennehy), believe these men have come to get out crime lord Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne). Roenick actually finds out, after sneaking out and killing one of the men, they are actually crooked cops, led by Capt. Marcus Duvall (Gabriel Byrne), head of the Organized Crime and Racketeering Squad, and they have actually come to kill Bishop to sop him testifying against the squad's corrupt activities. Roenick is taking a risk, letting out the prisoners of the station, including Bishop, along with Beck (John Leguizamo), Smiley (Jeffrey 'Ja Rule' Atkins) and Anna (Aisha Hinds) and arming them to help keep them out, but what else there to do? Also starring Kim Coates as Officer Rosen and Dorian Harewood as Gil. Apparently the original focuses more on the action than the relationships of the characters, this film obviously does vice versa, obviously it has the odd corny dialogue, but the acting and action just about makes up. Worth watching!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very Entertaining... but nothing's perfect</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I loved this movie!! It had me from beginning to (almost) end. The biggest highlight of the movie was that fact that it wasn't afraid to take some abnormal plot turns. It had some unexpected events which had people gasping loudly in the theater. When Hawk's psychiatrist and love interest in the movie makes a break for it in the SUV, you are almost certain that somehow she makes it out alive... she just has to... but no, it sticks to the more real idea that the enemy is merciless and intent on their goal.A very strong film and being from the Detroit area (20 minutes away), I did think it kind of extreme for this area, but then again, I would like to think that situation a bit extreme for any area. None-the-less it is an entertaining piece of film for which I voted a 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this Assault on Precinct 13 and it was the greatest remake that i've seen in a long time. So entertaining! It takes place in Detroit old precinct where a prison bus gets caught in the snow. Lawrence Fishburne is a mobster that the cops have been waiting to catch and he finally gets caught and is on this very bus. Lawrence Fishburne is the man. He was great in it! He was the tough, bad guy, but very smooth and cool. The film was a great thriller from start to finish. I think it was better than the original Carpenter flick. The chemistry between the actors, particularly Fishburne and Hawke was great. I don't want to give anything away but i will say this, definitely go out and see this movie this weekend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13Starring: Ethan Hawke, Laurence Fishburne, John Leguizamo, Ja Rule and Drea de MatteoGenre: Action/Drama/Crime/ThrillerRated RAssault on Precinct 13 is a remake of a movie with the same title that came out in 1976. On New Year's Eve, inside a police station that's about to be closed for good, but when a group of dirty cops come to hunt down and destroy the police in the old precinct in Detroit, Jake Roenick (Ethan Hawke) must try and take down these dirty cops! Even if that included getting help from some criminals with Marion Bishop (Laurence Fishburne). But the dirty cops were after Marion Bishop mainly because the person he was working with was getting greedy and wanted more in their deal. So it's up to Jake and Marion to take these guys down! This movie had a lot of thrills but they showed too many parts where people where getting shot in the head which was a bit gross because I don't like too much blood thrown around everywhere. But it was still really cool with a lot of way past cool action!</fullReview>
