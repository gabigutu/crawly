		<shortDescription>Awesome Assault</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is one of few directors who can successfully transform their movies into giant roller coaster rides without insulting the audience. James Cameron does this, sometimes, but usually adds more plot to his stories. Carpenter just takes simple premises, throws some characters together, and lets everything evolve and unwind on their own. "Assault on Precinct 13" deserves to be mentioned in the same breath as "Dawn of the Dead," or perhaps the overrated "Texas Chainsaw Massacre," as a very low-budget horror/thriller that takes a cast of unknowns, places them together, doesn't really delve into their backgrounds, but lets everything just work itself out like clockwork. There's an eager new cop, an infamous death row murderer, and a relocating precinct, all stuffed together into a movie about a vicious gang assault. It's brilliant in a very subtle way; a sign of things to come for a director who has implemented some of the most oft-used camera tricks in the horror world.He pioneered the first-person killer perspective in "Halloween" - an effect sorely missed on full screen TV and VHS versions, to once again be savored on the wide screen DVD presentation. Carpenter received quite a number of critical jabs in 1978 for his use of the POV technique, explained to be too voyeuristic and potentially dangerous to be shown in a mainstream motion picture. Hitchcock used the POV technique very subtly in "Psycho's" famous shower sequence, but in "Halloween" it was far blunter, resulting in an uproar of moral complaints.No matter. "Halloween" became movie horror legend, casting a spell over its viewers, inspiring major knock-offs such as the "Friday the 13th" series (which has overall made more money than the "Halloween" franchise due to more sequels than "Police Academy"). "Assault on Precinct 13" was one of Carpenter's very first efforts at directing. It shows. The movie is flawed, imperfect, both technically and otherwise (some of the dialogue in particular could have used fixing, and the acting is nothing incredible by any means). But it still has an addictive sense of urgency and frantic pacing that makes the movie feel like one long, non-stop, brutal assault - even though the setup for the film takes over forty minutes. It may not be a flawless film but it is one of my favorites.It's about a new cop named Bishop (Austin Stoker) who is put in charge of a transferring L.A. police precinct - number thirteen. As equipment is carried out of the building and last-minute closings are made, far away a bus load of convicts, including notorious murderer Wilson (Darwin Joston), decide to stop at precinct 13 due to the fact that one of the criminals seems to be coming down with a harsh cough. And downtown, a young girl is shot by a ruthless gang member. Her father shoots the killer, and then flees to precinct thirteen, hunted by the gang members, who eventually begin to siege the precinct in a suicide raid. Trapped with two killers, a few cops and a jail warden, Bishop and company try to think of a way out of the place without getting shot by the vicious gang outside.That's basically it - people stuck inside a police station trying to get out without dying in the process. The movie is only ninety minutes long, give or take, which is a good thing, because if it had been any longer it might have lost some of its pacing and become tiring. Instead, there isn't a single scene in "Assault on Precinct 13" that I think should have been cut. I'm sure there are some that could have been tossed onto the editing room floor, but I'm glad that the movie is the way it is - it flows smoothly and we don't ever feel like a scene has gone on too long or too short. In that sense, it's just about perfect.Carpenter has had one of the most successful careers of all time, followed by a legion of cult fans. His "Halloween" is one of the greatest horror films of all time, and one of the most influential. He occasionally makes his duds, like any director, but in this case, the good far outweighs the bad. "Assault on Precinct 13" is an utterly refreshing film experience that manages to maintain a fast speed but never appears to be cheating its target audience, or treating them stupid. The movie is being remade in 2005, with a considerably higher budget, bigger names, and probably worse directing. I don't really look forward to this remake because I can almost guarantee that, given the age it is being made in, there will be many pointless plot explanations, worse dialogue and bad direction. "Assault on Precinct 13" does not really need to be made again because the first one works so well. History has taught us that most remakes are not at all on the same level as their influences - just look at Hitchcock's "Psycho," then Van Sant's. If it isn't broken, don't fix it. "Assault on Precinct 13" is not broken and it does not need to be fixed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Violent and witty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is rightly considered a classic cult movie from the 1970's by the once reliable John Carpenter (who also composed the edgy early synth score). Basically it's a faint mish-mash of other movies, the dialogue is reminiscent of great westerns as a black policeman and a white convict battle against gang members in a Night of The Living Dead re-working. It's also tempting to draw Vietnam allegories (as with many American movies of the mid 1970's and after); the faceless, nameless gang members die in the droves but keep attacking the besieged police station and the lawmen and the lawbreakers, black and white, must unite to defeat them and escape with their lives.The real joy of this movie, however, is the playing of the two virtually unknown leads, Austin Stoker and the late Darwin Joston. They have a great, almost wry chemistry and use Carpenter's stripped-down witty dialogue to great effect. Because there are no 'stars', there are no real expectations, and the shocks when they come (including the famous ice cream sequence) are more shocking for it.The representation of women leaves a little to be desired (the two female characters obviously shop at the same sweater store!) but the character Lee shows some inner strength and resolve, and even has time for some kind of upper hand in terms of sexual tension between herself and Joston's Napoleon Wilson.If you haven't seen this movie I urge you to watch it; in terms of B movies and cult thrillers it's the yardstick in my opinion; simple, stylish, violent, witty and not remotely sentimental.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant, Suspenseful and Beautiful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in gang-riddled Los Angeles in the 1970s, director John Carpenter was inspired to make a film that was basically a combination of Rio Bravo (1959) and Night of the Living Dead (1968) with rookie cop Ethan Bishop in John Wayne's Rio Bravo role/Duane Jones' Ben, a recently vacated police precinct as the small town jail/farmhouse, and with gang members in place of Night of the Living Dead's zombies/Nathan Burdette's men.For some viewers, that premise alone may be enough for them to not be able to grant this film a 10, but Assault on Precinct 13 is yet another example of why quality isn't correlated to having unprecedented ideas.One of the first striking things about Assault on Precinct 13 is that it looks beautiful. It was made on a relatively low budget, and it looks like a large percentage of the money must have gone into camera rental, film stock and film processing. Douglas Knapp's color cinematography is crisp, innovative (I just love the shot with the camera mounted in front of the car headlight, with the sunset in the background) and marvelously portrays Los Angeles as a gritty, suburban wasteland as well, if not better, than any other film I can think of. What makes it effective isn't over-the-top, run down buildings and heavily populated streets, but vast, wide-open spaces, with squat, nondescript houses and buildings, all fading into nothingness. Knapp even manages to make the streets look like this, and a couple scenes are set in what is effectively a sand-logged desert, with a lonely, dangerous phone booth sitting in isolation. The police station also reflects the suburban wasteland look in terms of its spaces and their relationship to each other, its sparseness and its colors.The low budget nature of the film forced a very successful straightforward, brutal and realistic approach to the action, especially the violence. Carpenter, on his commentary track on the DVD, notes that some scenes weren't as he would have liked because they didn't have the coverage they needed, and had to let them play out, longer than normal, from a single angle. Thank the heavens for a lack of time and funding! Despite the over-the-top mayhem in subsequent action films by other directors, the impact of many of the scenes in this film cannot be topped, and it's often because of the unusual, almost documentary-like feel of the film.Also adding to the effect is Carpenter's score. Although it's technically primitive, it's just as good as any of his other music, and Carpenter is as talented as a film composer as he is as a director. His use of motifs, often in an almost trance-like repetition, is similar too, and just as effective as, both Bernard Herrmann and Ennio Morricone.The performances are all excellent, and the staging is even better. If you know anything about the premise of the film before you begin watching it for the first time, you may have difficulty figuring out how they're going to pull off the central situation of the film. The logistics seem to be against creating a prolonged tense situation. Carpenter and company create the perfect scenario with just a couple ingenious moves, and the unending threat, combined with the unusual pacing of the zombie-like menace make Assault on Precinct 13 as frightening as any horror film could be.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basic but very effective and fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a man and his daughter drive down the wrong street they get into the middle of a gang shooting. The little girl is killed and the father left distraught, but armed with another victim's gun. He catches up with the gang and kills the leader before seeking refuge in a local police station. However the station is only manned by a few staff as it is in the process of being shut down. A prison wagon also arrives at the station with sick prisoners for temporary holding ? however it is then that the street gang launch their attack with stolen and silenced automatic weapons.I had half watched this film several years ago and didn't review it then because I knew I had been distracted and not able to give it enough attention to be able to form a fair opinion of it ? however I didn't really enjoy it then. Giving it another chance produced a much more enjoyable film, even if it seems very basic on the face of it. The plot seems very simple and, in fairness, it is ? gang outside, people inside, people try to keep gang out and stay alive. This is doing it a disservice of course because it creates an enjoyable tension from this simple set-up and delivers some enjoyable (if basic) action and thrills. The direction is good; my personal favourite shot being the shot near the end where the smoke clears! This effective delivery is also aided by Carpenter's own score that is nicely pulsating and still sounds great even if it is dated ? the important thing is that it still fits the film and therefore works.The dialogue is trashy but this fits the slight b-movie feel the film has. The characters are also quite simple (very basic backgrounds and personalities for each) but again this seems to work really well. The strength of having a mostly unknown cast is that you can't be sure who will live or die by the end of the film. Despite being mostly unknowns (to me anyway) the performances are generally very enjoyable even if no Oscars are being given out. Stoker and Joston lead the film really well and give good, natural performances with an overflow of charisma. I don't know the other's outside of these two but the rest were good as well, even if the film belongs to Bishop and Wilson. I was a bit let down by the lack of a central bad guy but in one regard the film also uses this well by making the gang an unseen threat that could be an isolated group or an army.Overall this is a very basic film in several regards, but it is also a very effective and enjoyable one. If you are looking for film references then there are some to be had but for most of us the film's charismatic leads, action and effective tension will be what we stay for ? and luckily it has all those with some to spare.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A 1970s suspense classic. Absolutely brilliant!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching John Carpenter's latest 'Ghosts Of Mars' recently I couldn't help but wonder what happened to Carpenter's vision. 'Assault On Precinct 13' was made 25 years earlier on probably a tenth of the budget and is basically the same movie only ten times better! Carpenter self-consciously uses Hawks' 'Rio Bravo', adds a touch of Romero's 'Night Of The Living Dead' and comes up with arguably the most exciting siege movie of all time. This gem is a perfect example of superior low budget film making. Relative unknowns Austin Stoker ('Abby') and Darwin Joston ('Eraserhead') are both outstanding as the stars of this taut and unpredictable thriller, and the supporting cast includes Laurie Zimmer (sadly her only movie), Nancy Loomis ('Halloween'), Kim Richards ('The Car' - in the movie's most controversial and memorable scene), and Carpenter semi-regular Charles Cyphers ('Escape From New York'). One of Carpenter's best efforts and overall an extraordinarily underrated movie. 'Assault On Precinct 13' is a classic! Add this to your "must see" list immediately!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is possibly one of Carpenter's best films,with the exception of The thing.It is one of the great siege films of all time.The scene with Kim Richards(escape to witch mountain) is one of my favorites.This movie proves you don't have to have a multimillion dollar budget and big name stars to make a great movie.The performance by Laurie Zimmer was incredible.I can't believe she was never cast in another film(but thats Hollywood for you).If you like action and thrillers this film is definitely worth a look.Its not perfect, the plot has some holes, the premise is at times shaky, but all of the actors produce believable performances,especially Austin Stoker,Darwin Joston, and of course Zimmer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Neat thriller from John `Claustrophobia' Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Assault on Precinct 13' shows Carpenter in the fine creative form of his earlier days, when he produced such thriller and horror gems like `Halloween', `The Thing' and this little movie. As usual he eschews a complex plot in favour of a great little central concept - in this case a group of civilians, prisoners and police trapped in a deserted police station under siege from a mysterious gang who want to get at one man inside.The acting in these movies is generally bland, but Carpenter at least breathes some dimension into his characters. The lead role goes to Lt. Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), the cop in charge of minding the building for the night. Naturally he's honourable but there's also a good sense of pragmatism to his character. Similarly the prisoner Napoleon (Darwin Joston) isn't just a criminal - there's something quite human to him. The same goes for the civilians caught up - despite their disparities the characters become a relatively cohesive unit that's quite believable, enjoyable without veering into grating sentimentality ever. Naturally a lot of them are cannon fodder but the loss of individuals in such movies is one of the anticipations you expect in the genre.Carpenter did a great service by making the protagonists of the piece silent. They never utter a word. They have nothing in common, hailing from all races. We have no motivation for their actions and thankfully we're spared weak, and frankly pointless, excuses. Instead their blank faced determinism, and the manner in which they mete out death, lends them a horrific cold bloodedness that is far more memorable than typical thriller character building. There's not so much a sense of palpable evil but a much more terrifying sense of complete inhumanity. Carpenter also uses his great skills with claustrophobia - even the outdoor scenes are deserted, lonely, isolated. The actual station under siege is well designed - we're made aware of the layout quickly, before the action starts, so that the action sequences make sense without confusing us on issues of location. The darkness of the proceedings - pale lighting and so forth - add to the edgy mood of the characters. And Carpenter once again has a nice musical score accompanying his movie - it may sound dated, but it suits the ambience and atmosphere to a tee. `Assault on Precinct 13' is hardly clever. It's not claiming to be. It's a low budget work with a central `siege' idea. It works because of the claustrophobic element, the feeling of desperation in the characters, some neat villains and fairly well fleshed characters. It may not be the pinnacle of its type, but it sure is enjoyable while it lasts. 6.8/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "Assault" began in 1976, and hasn't let up yet</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With the release of the 2005 remake of John Carpenter's classic action film, "Assault on Precinct 13," rapidly approaching, I took a chance and managed to purchase the last DVD copy of the special edition at my local video store and I must say that Carpenter's second directorial feature ranks amongst some of the director's finest work.The first film by Carpenter that I really liked was "The Thing" (1982), because it utilized its claustrophobic setting and escalating tension by focusing on the paranoia of the characters rather than splattering the screen with pointless action."Assault on Precinct 13" has much in common with "The Thing" in this sense, the mounting tension and fears between the characters, which of course help to further the plot and heighten a slight emotional attachment to the leads.I'll say that Carpenter's film is a perfect example of what's wrong with a lot of movies today, and how Hollywood has grown less skillful and daring over the years. For those that don't know what I mean, just watch the scene in "Precinct" with the "wrong-flavored ice cream" to get an idea of just HOW far Carpenter was willing to go with this picture.Though the primary setting for the action in this movie takes place at the abandoned police station in Precinct 9, Division 13, it opens with the shooting deaths of six Los Angeles gang members by the police. News breaks on random radio stations inform the audience that a large cache of weapons was stolen from a facility and the police are overworked with the rapid rise in crime over the last 24 hours.The camera then centers on four sinister-looking individuals in their living room, weapons and ammo boxes strewn about, they each sit, like warlords at a tribal counsel, plotting what evil deeds they're about to unleash. They then enter into a blood oath, to the death, but for what is largely unknown.Across town, Bishop (Austin Stoker), the newly promoted lieutenant, is on his way to work for his first assignment and is ordered to head over to Precinct 9, where there are only a few people working. Already many of the supplies and ammunition have been moved across town to the new police station, which is located far away.At a local jail across town, Nathaniel Wilson (Darwin Joston) is on his way to prison to face the death penalty for several murders, of which the nature is presumably extreme since he's being put to death. We know it had to be something horrific, since he informs one of the officers supervising him that a preacher once told him that he had seen death in his eyes.It would seem that fate, or the "Street Thunder," the largest, most powerful and deadliest gang in Los Angeles, brings them all together at Precinct 9, where the few police officers on duty and a few convicts are forced to make a stand, as the murderous gang members lay siege to the police station with heavy-weapons fire.Carpenter's second feature is heavy on wall-to-wall action and vicious violence, but surprisingly there's a strong center about the characters and the dire situation they're trapped in. Only a handful of people remain in the police station to ward off the seemingly hundreds of faceless, murderous gang members that want into the place, and aren't afraid to die in the process.Carpenter owed a lot to the apparent source material, "Rio Bravo," which had a similar plot about everyday people who are forced to make not-so-everyday decisions when they become trapped in a nightmarish situation with some very upset people looking for their blood.I can only hope that the remake of this 1976 action classic is as bold and daring as its predecessor, or we'll have one hell of a flop on our hands.10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>on par with its inspiration(s); a must see Carpenter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ackowledged by it's own creator on the DVD, Assault on Precinct 13 is a bit more of a hybrid than just a sheer homage to Howard Hawks's Rio Bravo. It has traces of that (editing name, ho-ho), and of the Western specifics in bits of the storytelling devices and stereotypes. But it also has traces of the horror film, of the basic theme of demise by outside forces that not only rests in the best of zombie films but also in a lot of Carpenter's later work. What makes the film seem fresh today, even if it takes its time to get started in the first half hour, is how focused the action is around the story. Even with these basic characters- those with speaking parts closer to archetypes than not- it all works. It's a practically-perfect midnight movie.You've got your good guys, a mix of cops and criminals (one of them, Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson, has enough style as an actor without even flinching at times). And you've got the ravenous gang (achem, zombies) out for blood after a gun down by a vengeful father. What surprising about how this very simple premise is set up, of a showdown in the worst pit of Los Angeles, is how it's all close to being just a pure exploitation film. But there's some thought or maybe just music to the film (not the actual music, though that's cool in its way) just as relentless as in Carpenter's other work, maybe even more in its rough way. It is a violent film, but the violence comes and goes leaving more room for talk than one might expect given it's by-a-thread rating. It's quite clear where the visual style would end up lending itself to in later years too (i.e. Reservoir Dogs).When taking aside the occasional misstep, like an unneeded (suggested) sub-plot (not that Joston or Laurie Zimmer are bad actors, but they lack chemistry), Assault on Precinct 13 comes out without many scratches at all. It's a lean film at 90 minutes, with enough tension for two more. When it is shocking it shocks, when it wants a cheap, solid laugh or (more often) grin it comes through, and it doesn't pull any punches in letting you know here and there this is nothing more than a genre exercise. That Carpenter is able to pull it off so un-pretentiously is a credit to his first inspiration, as well as to the spirit of the long boiled ingredients of older films. In short, the most cult you can find by the filmmaker without going to his previous effort Dark Star. Grade: A</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I long for the days when John Carpenter was ingenious enough to make such excellent films as his classics like Halloween, Escape From New York, and of course, The Thing. He's gone way downhill since those glory days but thankfully he built himself enough of a legacy that the aforementioned films will be the one's he is known for, along with a little film called Assault of Precinct 13. This is one of Carpenter's very first films, made back in 1976. It tells the story of a group of people holed up in a police station that is under siege by a ruthless South Los Angeles gang. It is a wicked film full of intense action, riveting suspense, and an incredible score written by Carpenter himself. It is a brief 90 minute flick that has a very low budget indie feel to it, but this only adds to the experience which makes this film into something truly remarkable.It's hard to place exactly why I love this film. It is one of those that seems like it shouldn't be nearly as enjoyable and excellent as it is. There's plenty of cheese and its a very small scale low budget flick that doesn't possess any kind of pizazz, no remarkable production value, and no big name stars to carry the film. But it might just be all of these things that combine to make this film so much fun and so incredibly compelling. Carpenter makes the most out of what little he has and makes a uniquely awesome film. Herein lies a style that you either love or hate. If you can stand low budget action then you should love this film, as I do. If you long for something bigger then chances are you won't get much out of this. It's a matter of personal preference, but my preferences make me enjoy this film almost too much.Something else that makes this film work is its overall tone. It's a very serious and hard hitting film. It is brutal and unapologetic when it comes to the level of violence, and it doesn't hold back. The immense darkness of the film makes us believe in what we are seeing and draws us deep into the film's driving emotion and sincerely intense action. This film is not satire, it's not a farce, it's not a parody. It is it's own type of film, managing to be utterly serious and absolutely wicked. This is a must see whether you are a John Carpenter fan or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The gritty, stylish 'Assault on Precinct 13 (1976)' is my first experience with American director John Carpenter, labelled an "auteur" by the French and a "bum" by his compatriots. At this early stage, I'm siding with the French. This is one of the definitive "siege films," a deft, low-budget blend of the American Western (let's say '3:10 to Yuma (1957)') and a zombie movie ('Night of the Living Dead (1968)' being an obvious influence). In modern-day Los Angeles, the lone inhabitants of a closing-down police station ? among them police officers (Austin Stoker), secretaries (Laurie Zimmer), and prisoners (an ice-cool Darwin Joston) ? are affronted by dozens of armed gangsters, who are waging a bloody war with the authorities as payback for recent gang-member deaths.After an extended prologue, in which disparate story lines fatalistically converge on each other (and featuring one particularly nasty moment than nearly landed the film an X-rating) the siege scenario begins? and the tension rarely lets up. One sequence in particular, a tense crawl towards a parked car, had me holding my breath for minutes, its conclusion a veritable kick in the guts. Carpenter, assisted by his own low-key but insistent synchronised score, manipulates the film's urban setting to his advantage: isolation becomes so much more unbearable when civilisation is so near, and yet so unattainable. Chillingly, most of the antagonists themselves remain faceless shadows in the darkness, representing an incomprehensible force of evil, consumed by bloodlust, and unafraid of the consequences.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 is written, directed, edited and musically scored by John Carpenter. It stars Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Martin West, Tony Burton, Charles Cyphers and Nancy Kyes. Cinematography is by Douglas Knapp.If you are going to homage films that you love, or ones that influence you, then you have to get it right. Something John Carpenter most assuredly did with this, his first masterpiece. Plot and structure of film are simplicity extreme, but it's the execution that matters here, the cool veneer of the hero characters, the frightening relentlessness of the gang members who assault the soon to close down police station and the small number of inhabitants within. Interestingly it's actually Precinct 9, Division 13, but Carpenter was no doubt in a playful mood.Carpenter builds the first half slowly, introducing key characters whilst deftly staging the events that will lead to the actual siege itself. This part of Los Angeles where the story is set is conspicuous by how empty and soulless it seems, even in daylight, which is where the terror actually begins. It's as if residents and locals just prefer to be off the streets at any time of day or night. The gang, like the folk inside the station, are multiracial, but unlike those inside the gang never speak. They move like silent assassins, no shouting or cussing, just a tidal wave of death, their guns adorned with silencers, which leads to a truly brilliant extended sequence as the gang begin to destroy the building silently! Meanwhile relationships are being formed by those under duress, convicts and police forced to battle side by side in the slightest hope of surviving the night.There is no flab on show here, no pointless dialogue or scenes which could have been cut, it's a film that is very much to the point. The cast respond well to Carpenter's requirements, be it emotionally, physically or coolly, all while Carpenter's low tone synthesiser plays out its memorably eerie beats. It's a superb lesson in low budget film making from one of the masters of that art. His filmic star may have waned in his later life, but for a time in the 70s and 80s he shone bright, Assault On Precinct 13 was the ignition. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Early Carpenter Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 (1976), directed by John Carpenter. 91 minutesPlot: A run-down Los Angeles police station is seized by a ruthless gang of murderous criminals on the eve of its decommissioning. A rookie officer is left in charge of a few stray employees and an assortment of prisoners who must band together to battle the intruders, lest they be mowed down in the path of their endless destruction.Directing: As Carpenter's second directorial effort, "Assault" stands as a prime example of the director's skill at turning something into nothing. Crafting such an intense movie with very little resources was a skill that would pay off big time a few years down the line with the release of his seminal slasher flick, "Halloween." There are other hints at future Carpenter-isms, such as his bleak world view which would be further exploited in "Escape From New York" and "They Live." In typical Carpenter fashion, very little time is wasted, and when one of cinema's biggest taboos in trampled underfoot within the first 30 minutes, you know you're in for a one-of-a-kind experience. But rather than resorting to pure shock value, Carpenter cuts through the ultra-violence with a dose of good humor and over-the-top action. The last block of film itself plays like George Romero's "Night Of The Living Dead," only with thugs rather than zombies cornering our beloved characters.Cast: Austin Stoker plays the wholesome hero officer, in sharp contrast to the self-assured and cool-as-a-cucumber alpha-criminal, as played by Darwin Joston. While Stoker oozes the necessary likability, Joston hams it up a bit, making his character sound better on paper. No matter, though, as the two play off of each other beautifully and you find yourself rooting for each individual equally. Future Carpenter regulars Nancy Loomis and Charlie Cyphers have bit parts, but are inconsequential to the plot. As far as the villains of the piece go, they are a dime-a-dozen, and by the end of the film, there are literally dozens of them coming from out of nowhere. There isn't really a single villain you could pick out of the crowd, as they are mostly faceless.Music: A classic Carpenter scores pulses through the film at key moments, but is never over-bearing in the slightest. Within one viewing, you'll find yourself tapping and humming along, a sure-fire clue that you are watching a prime Carpenter film.The Bottom Line(s): "Assault On Precinct 13" is a rather under-appreciated classic, though a minor one at that. It features a streak of ultraviolence and cynicism that could only have been produced in a post-Vietnam culture. Any fan of Carpenter, or thrillers in general, should see this ground-breaking little film at least once.Lessons Learned: 1. Never ask a black man if he likes his coffee black, unless you are prepared for a witty comeback.2. If an ice-cream man gets your order wrong, it's probably best to cut your losses and not go back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not without its charm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's no-budget pseudo-remake of "Rio Bravo" (with heavy doses of "Night of the Living Dead" thrown in--the zombies replaced by inhuman hordes of street toughs) set in a besieged 1970s LA police station scheduled to be closed the next day, is a flawed but worthwhile 90 minutes from a flawed but worthwhile filmmaker.The best thing about "Assault" is its bare-bones construction. There's precious little backstory, no real explanation for the heinous actions of the gang members, no extraneous "character development" for the protagonists, no scenes where they talk about how they have a wife and kids at home or are retiring tomorrow, and very few cutaways from the main action once it gets going (the lone exception being a few sequences with couple of clueless cops patrolling the neighborhood who keep missing the siege on the supposedly abandoned precinct). The only music is Carpenter's cheap-but-effective synth score, which only serves to heighten the action rather than distract us from it. It's the kind of minimalism big-budget Hollywood just doesn't have the patience for.The film delivers some memorable sequences, to be sure. The office being shot up by silenced gunfire, so that the windows, papers, and furniture seem to be popping and jumping of their own accord; the image of the mob of gangsters silently and fluidly sliding across our line of vision in the shadows; and, of course, the incredibly jarring and appalling "ice cream" scene.When all is said and done, however, "Assault" doesn't quite add up to a completely satisfying movie. While the psychology of the siege is well-executed, the final action sequence is a bit anticlimactic and doesn't quite live up to it. Also, the movie's less-is-more aesthetic is a bit punishing for the first 20-odd minutes before the good stuff starts--it comes across like the uninspired and weakly constructed beginning of an MST3K movie. I kept expecting a giant insect to gobble up one of the characters.At its best, then, "Assault" is lean and mean. But at its worst, it's a bit thin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>DARWIN JOSTON - A LOST ICON</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having watched "Assault On Precinct 13", one of the greatest thrillers of the 70's, over the last quarter of a century, I was saddened to learn that the actor at the heart of one of the all-time charismatic performances - Darwin Joston - died back in 1998. I had always assumed that he had gone on to greater things but apparently no!My question is simply this. How can an actor who delivers such a memorably strong and iconic performance as this, in such a strong 'cult' movie, be almost forgotten today ?Seeing that most of his credits after this film were focused behind the camera in the capacity of a 'driver' on film sets, I feel very sad that his obvious on-screen talent was not exploited more fully.Does anybody out there have any further information on this lost diamond?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A strange mix-up of genres that barely works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's second feature, this little B-movie is his 'modern retelling' of 'Rio Bravo'. A man chases and kill a gang member who killed his daughter, and them hides in a closing-down precinct. This leads to an all-out assault from the gang, as the people still there (some officers and prisoners) have to team up to defend themselves.I usually love Carpenter's films, but I have to say this one was disappointing. And you can't even blame his inexperience, considering he had already done the excellent 'Dark Star'. He seems really confused here.The characters are not only wooden, the gang members are more like zombies. They don't act like living beings (how one reacted when shot by the father, for example), they merely rush without thinking at times, and are flat-out expressionless. Carpenter admitted to taking inspiration from 'Night of the Living Dead', but come on: this was supposedly a realistic film and they are supposedly humans, you can't really make it work like that.Furthermore, they ARE shown to be intelligent. The way the gang cleverly organizes the attack is a total contradiction from the kamikaze-like actions they make a moment later; even the 'explanation' makes no damn sense. For the most part the assault looks EXACTLY like your typical zombie film's 'characters in a building holding off a zombie horde' scene.The other characters, while not suffering from that, aren't any good either. The dialogues they are given are extremely bad and inconsistent with the situation at times, and the acting only makes it worse. Darwin Joston, for example, is totally lacking in the wit his character's dialogues seem to imply he has; Austin Stoker and Laurie Zimmer are also bad, and only Tony Burton is salvageable among the main actors.I would like to know if Carpenter (or anyone who worked in this film) has ever used a silenced weapon. It is a common problem in films, especially spy ones, but since it is made a major plot point here it bugged me. This 'a silenced weapon can not even be heard' is RIDICULOUS; a silenced gun still reaches around 120db, or as loud as (if not more than) a car honk to anyone close-by. The idea that no one nearby would hear it, especially when they are shooting WINDOWS (which is also quite loud), makes this lose a lot of credibility (as one character even states, how the **** is a shooting in the middle of a city not being heard by anyone?!).Despite all its flaws, the movie still has some of Carpenter's usual qualities. The movie takes its time in the beginning, sure, but Carpenter knows how to create a mood; the assault is quite tense (despite its silly moments and sometimes out-of-place dialogue), as well as some earlier scenes (even if they, too, make no damn sense, like the killing of the girl). The assault itself is not quite bad either; despite the zombie horde similarities, it is quite fun. The soundtrack is also excellent, the only flawless thing in the entire film.The movie has its moments, but overall it is far too idiotic to work. Had 'Assault on Precinct 13' been a zombie invasion film rather than a cop/gang action/thriller, it could have been successful. As it stands, though, this is little more than a silly B-movie, and Carpenter is way above this kind of thing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fun Carpenter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Assault on Precinct 13," is a siege thriller set in an L.A. police station. The movie chronicles a few tense hours as a closing precinct is attacked by a large group of gang members. Typical of Carpenter, the film has a lonely and oppressive low budget feel. The evoked mood is one of the movies greatest strengths. In a way, the film comes off as unnervingly real. That the attackers are relatively unorganized is to be expected. What makes this story chilling is the sense that this is animal against animal. The humanity of the gang members is left blank so as to emphasize the brutal nature of the attack. This is not akin to "Bataan," in which the enemy was defaced for propaganda. Rather, Carpenter hits on the feeling of simple, ferocious, and violent confrontation.While the film does elicit wonderful fears about life or death struggle, Carpenter did cut some corners. A somewhat distracting refrain comes from the protagonists repeatedly saying that back up is soon to arrive. Even though Carpenter has armed the gang with silenced weapons, the staggering degree of isolation is hard to swallow, especially when regularly reminded. A second issue is the way in which the assault is finally discovered. Deus ex machina is a functioning formula but when employed, it leaves much to be desired. In AoP13, the arrival of the cavalry feels almost as if Carpenter had run out of ideas or had written himself into an unwanted tragedy and needed a way out. The above, and a few other issues, aside; the film is a well paced thriller. In addition, the four protagonist characters stand out as near perfect use of stock characterization. The "straight as an arrow" cop, the "dark yet honorable" criminal, the "world weary" female lead, and the "overly boastful yet kind" convict are all well portrayed and convincing enough. In fact, Carpenter has added enough touches to these people so that the audience really can empathize with them.As with most low budget films, the over all technical display is modest. The cinematography is confined to set pieces and urban "waste." The editing and pacing, typical of Carpenter, begin slowly and build to an exciting and fast climax. The score, another Carpenter addition, is fitting and accents the stark mood well. The highlights of the film really are the eerie feeling of brute competition and the easy to identify with characters. Overall, this is a fun film that achieves more than most low budget offerings.On a personal note, I will recommend this film for future movie nights. While AoP13 is not a film to be watched once a month; it is a tense pot boiler that has a wide appeal. 7.3 of 10 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I'll Tell You Sometime</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A thoroughly obvious riff on Rio Bravo, Carpenter's Assault ratchets up the tension and creates, more or less, the template for all action movies. It's unfortunate too few films designed to thrill and excite follow the pattern.This very lean urban western tells the tale of several Los Angelinos of various colors trapped in a police station under siege by a faceless, ethnically mixed street gang that practices, I think, a form of nihilism. Except that isn't the whole story, which is precisely why this film is terrific. The actual siege doesn't begin until at least halfway through the movie, and, up until that point, Carpenter spends his time establishing his characters and building suspense. Until, as I said, the halfway point, Carpenter tells three separate stories--Bishop and Leigh babysit a vacant precinct; Wilson and Wells are being transported; and a man and his daughter are trying to find grandma. Ultimately, of course, these tales merge into the siege, but it is a wonder to watch it all come together. As I said, Carpenter is taking quite a bit from Rio Bravo, but the editing--the way in which he mixes the stories together--is incredible and leaves you breathless from start to finish. It is an incredibly paced film--one to which others should look for inspiration. Aside from the actual story telling, the framing and photography of the film is really superb. John Carpenter does not get the credit he deserves, I think, in these areas. He receives praise from all corners for his atmosphere and thrill-inducing direction, but no one comments on how amazing his films look (watch Escape from New York and tell me it's not gorgeously shot). Take, for instance, this film's shots of the gang members standing guard between two Do Not Enter signs or the framing of the scenes inside the precinct--they're so tight you cannot help but feel claustrophobic. Most importantly, Assault on Precinct 13 shows Carpenter at his most Romero-esquire. This means that, though dealing with a very conventional genre, he infuses it with social criticism and concern. Like Romero's first two Living Dead flicks, the protagonists from the start are black and female and the most sympathetic white characters are either a sniveling wreck of a man who not only lost his daughter but became a murderer or a hardened criminal. There is definitely an us versus them theme going on in this film as well,but, notably, it's not black versus white or good versus bad. The good guys have a criminal among their ranks, for instance, and they're busy protecting a man, who, though justified, committed a crime. Given the post-Watergate/Vietnam era in which Carpenter filmed Assault, the moral ambiguity should not surprise anyone. Furthermore, that he doesn't proselytize and explain what's right and wrong--that he acknowledges that right and wrong can sometimes appear to be the same thing simultaneously--is to Carpenter's credit. Very few films are willing to reside, thematically, in such a grey area. It's a pleasure to see one that does. Assault on Precinct 13--intelligent and exciting--is a high watermark for American adventure film-making. Find it, watch it, and behold its brilliance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Set-up fails to deliver on a pay off- though, the theme tune is catchy!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter, director of greats such as 'Halloween' (1978) and 'The Thing' (1976), is behind the original 'Assault on Precinct 13' (1976)! However, for my money, the recently released remake is better and far more intense. That said, the original was marred by a low budget, and to its credit, it did have a very catchy theme tune, and one memorable Ice Cream Van sequence, when even the most innocent is not spared. Sadly, the promise of an interesting set-up certainly didn't pay off.The main problem with the original film is that the villains really were faceless during the siege. Their purpose for revenge didn't really gel that well in my book, and it seemed only by chance that they decided to go after the soon-to-be shut down precinct. The scene with the Ice Cream van where the little girl turns around to swap her ice cream cone was another gripe. The distance she was from the van when walking back to her Dad meant that if she turned around to face the van again- she would have clearly seen the side of the van where the driver was being assaulted. It's not like her vision would have been distorted or blocked just because she was physically on the pathway on the right-hand side of the van. Even four or five metres away, a person facing the front of the van would clearly see both sides of the van even if that person is more to the van's right side. The film suggested that the girl was at least fifteen metres from the van, she would have clearly seen three threatening looking gang-members assault the driver, cause she would have clearly seen both sides of the van the minute she turned around. The film tried to cover it up with editing, but when you remember the long shots of the van, and the set-up of the sequence shots, there is no way, this little girl would have not noticed this! I immediately thought this after the scene. Similarly, the guy who was set-up as the main bad guy was extremely short-lived. And somehow, the girl's father manages to kill him and remain unscathed--- after he approaches a car full of four well-armed gang members.So, the believability factor in the original is somewhat questionable. Sure, the remake was far-fetched in certain aspects as well, but I found the original to be less believable- especially with the gang members' motives and the sudden appearance of a multitude of members at the precinct. As well as the fact, that no one noticed the source of the noise- where the remake has a blizzard, and doesn't have the precinct is the middle of suburbia like the original does. The original has gang members continually attacking the precinct and leaving marks, but at the same time covering their tracks by removing bodies and putting cars back into position- yet, when it's all said and done, there is a dead phone operator left hanging around for the cops to eventually find. Seriously, are these most inconsistent bad guys or what? As for our heroes, Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) is a likable enough leader of the skeleton crew of a precinct, but his character is very one-dimensional, and I never felt like he was truly scared. It is Napoleon Wilson's character (Darwin Joston) that gets a lot of set-up time in development, but we never find out his crime, or the meaning of his name. I thought this was unnecessarily ambiguous overall, and our heroes just went through the motions. Similarly, the father of the daughter sits the rest of the film out and does absolutely nothing. The uneasy truce between the cop and the inmates lacked intensity, and the story seemed to just go through the motions as only one of two inmates tests that authority briefly.In closing, the original 'Assault on Precinct 13'is nowhere near John Carpenter's best work, and the film was fairly obscure on most people's radars. Unlike cult horror-flick in 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre' around the same era, the original 'Assault on Precinct 13' did not have the same notoriety as TCM! So, I think the 2005 remake with Ethan Hawke was a welcome edition and better than the original- cause seriously, the original was never that revered in the first place. In my humble opinion, the original 'Assault on Precinct 13' wasn't that good to begin with, but considering it was a low-budget flick and had catchy theme music- it is not a complete travesty.**? out of *****!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the first film that I can say scared the heck out of me, of course I was 10 at the time (now I'm 30). I saw it recently and fell in love with it. The story of the last day of a Police precinct in Los Angeles and the battle the people inside have with a street gang is incredible. Why the producers of the remake choose to change the story I will never understand. This is a movie about a group of people that are stuck inside a building, out gunned and out manned, but manage to survive. Everyone should see this film. The opening scene with the murder of a little girl at an ice cream truck is one of the most heart wrenching scenes I have ever seen. This movie deserves a lot more attention that it has received over the years. There might not have been a lot of money spent on the production of this film but it is one of the best action films of the last 30 years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to rent this film seeing as a friend recommended it to me and i have to say i was very disappointed. The film did not have much tension,thrills or suspense and it is supposed to be an action thriller after all! There's little plot or character depth,i just didn't feel sorry or care about any of the characters and if they were to have their brains blasted out i would not have been that shocked.I also thought that the acting was wooden as none of the characters seem very scared at what was happening to them. There are some plus points in the film such as there's one killing scene which i thought was brutal and darwin joston gave the film some black humor with his 'got a smoke?' catchphrase but the rest of the cast(especially lauren zimmer)could and should have done better. Overall there are gome good points and it is a low budget thriller so i didn't expect amazing action scenes but ultimately this just seemed run of the mill fare.Verdict: 5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You can say a lot about John Carpenter ....but not that his visions as a director are limited. He's responsible for milestones in two of my favorite genres of cinema. Horror ( Halloween, the Thing ) and Action ( Assault and Escape from New York ). Carpenter was a multi-talented director around the time this movie was shot. He was a master in creating unique suspense and atmosphere and he was way ahead of his time. The futuristic image his portrays here is exceptional, depressive and disturbing. Therefore, Assault on Precinct 13 is an absolute MUST for action-fans and cult freaks.Small SPOILERS coming up !!!!!!! The plot of Assault is surprisingly simple. Several characters are introduced briefly and after a certain incident they get united in an abandoned police station. From that moment on, these different types of personalities have to fight for their lives and stick together. They're kept under siege by violent gang-members who set their mind to slaughtering everybody inside the station. How simple this may sound, it's a lot more effective than most other far-fetched movies. Carpenter manages to create a claustrophobic atmosphere in his movie that lasts for almost the entire movie ( also thanks to his intense and creepy musical score ). The bad acting is a bit disappointing you have to keep in mind that Carpenter worked with a limited budget and rather inexperienced actors. The little weaknesses in Assault are widely compensated by the explicit violence shown on screen. For several sequences in this movie, you need to have a pretty strong stomach?Especially when watching his most recent films ( like Ghost of Mars and Vampires ) you can't help wondering what the hell happened to John Carpenter !! He seemed to have lost every bit of his ancient talent. His modern movies are uninspired, pointless and not at all memorable. You can't go wrong if you stick to his classics?like this one. Highly recommended? Oh, one more thing?.Assault on Precinct 13 contains the most brutal and shocking slaughtering sequence I ever saw !! You'll know which one I'm talking about when you see it. Enjoy !!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Quickie Review: Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Precinct 13 is what Carpenter considers to be his first real film. Despite being so, it contains some very impressive camera angles and use of shadows, as well as a score that, although technically simple, epitomises the word 'cool'. Made on a shoestring budget, it was unfairly gnawed at by critics and yet eventually cemented itself as a cult classic (which is a sentence that can be attributed to half of Carpenter's filmography) The plot, like all the best Carpenter movies, is a simple one ? A group on inhabitants in an abandoned police station find themselves under attack from an unstoppable street gang. The lack of funds available meant that coverage of scenes had to be played out from a single angle longer than normal. This gives the movie a straightforward, brutal and almost documentary-like approach. Pretty violent for its time, Precinct 13 grips you as you will for the goodies to make it out of this sticky situation alive. You also don't need to be a genius to see all the nods and reverences to Carpenter's favourite westerns. The acting quality varies between cast members, but the dynamic duo of Police Officer Austin Stroker and anti-hero Darwin Joston make up for the relatively sub-par supporting cast. The tension present in the film is just one of the many Carpenter trademarks that he would be later known for. Not much is known about the huge, almost cult-like, street gang ? they are as enigmatic as any Carpenter villain, and the tautness of the movie is improved because of this. Best Scene: That ice cream truck scene, which completely shocked me. A young girl who looks around only seven walks to the truck to replace her ice-cream but unbeknownst to her it have been boarded by the street gang. One member, without even looking, just points her gun at the sweet girl and blows her away. There's no dramatic music or anything; it's done in a matter-of-fact kind of way, which makes it all the more disturbing.</fullReview>

They also shoot a little girl. Her father picks up the gun, and he is able to get revenge, because civilians are allowed to win gunfights in movies if they do not own the gun, but only pick up someone else's gun. But the gang wants revenge against him, and they chase him into a police station, which is on the verge of shutting down permanently. From then on, they attack the station, acting like zombies, never talking, and relentlessly attacking no matter how many are killed. It is just as well they don't talk, because the dialogue inside the police station is pretty dumb, and so the less talking there is in this movie, the better.</fullReview>

Newly promoted Lieutenant Ethan Bishop is put in charge of precinct 9 division 13 during the last few hours before it is permanently closed down. The station is short-staffed with Captain Chaney and the station's two secretaries Leigh and Julie. Starker is in command of a prison bus transporting Napoleon Wilson and Death Row inmate Wells. They stop at the precinct to get help for sick prisoner Caudell. The gangs go on a rampage chasing Lawson to the precinct where they lay siege.It takes too long for the movie to get going. There are way too many separate stories that have to gather into the precinct. It's usual to see a little girl with an ice cream cone get shot in the chest but that could have been done without doing a long story with the father. The point is to get these people into the precinct like a fort in the old west. John Carpenter wrote and directed this strip down action thriller. The gun fights aren't that exciting. All the gangsters use silencers which makes for less exciting sound effects. Also the slow moving cars is not that effective in driving the excitement. The acting is pretty stiff. I don't really understand why the characters just stand around. They could at least barricade the station. Plenty of bad guys get killed but nobody thinks to strip them of their weapons. In general, this movie would make more sense if this is some small town police station. It would be a much better fit for the wild west fort. Nevertheless, it's still a relatively good low budget B-movie action after a slow start.</fullReview>

There is many disturbing images in this film. Many people might have a hard time with them however John was talented and he made that scenes frighting but not feel cheap and tacky. The cast is not unknown you will see familiar faces from films that you have seen before In its final night of operation a police station becomes a target of a gang. The police station however has little bullets and no way of communicating with the outside world.If you want to see a fun film you can't get much better then this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Of The Best Action-Thrillers Ever Made. Another Carpenter Classic.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault On Precinct 13 is one of the best Action-Thrillers ever made and a Cult Classic. Filled with great direction,amazing Action and a wonderful score,Assault On Precinct 13 is Carpenter at his best.Set in Los Angeles,California,Assault On Precinct 13 tells the story of a group of people including cop Ethan Bishop(Austin Stoker)and criminal Napoleon Wilson(Darwin Joston)who are at an abandoned police station and are being stalked and attacked by a dangerous gang called Street Thunder. Now the cops and criminals have to figure out how to stay alive and stop the Assault On Precinct 13.Released in 1976,John Carpenter's Assault On Precinct 13 was ignored in America failing at the Box Office and receiving mixed reviews from critics. But when Assault On Precinct 13 was released in the United Kingdom and Europe Assault received rave reviews from critics and became a Cult Classic. Years later Assault On Precinct 13 has been rediscovered in America becoming a Cult Classic in the U.S and seen as one of Carpenter's best films. One of the reasons I love Assault On Precinct 13 and it's such an excellent film is because Carpenter basically combines elements of classics such as Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo and George A. Romero's Night Of The Living Dead and creates a unique film with Assault On Precinct 13 where instead of Cowboys and Zombies it's policemen,street gangs and criminals. The opening scene in AOP13 sets the tone for the rest of the film with Carpenter giving us an intense and suspenseful Action-Thriller that grips you from beginning to end where there is tension and fear all around and you feel like no one in the film is safe and the characters are on edge. Carpenter loves Westerns and the influence of the Western genre is on full display here with the characters,story and tone reminiscent of the Western films of John Ford and Howard Hawks but brought into the modern world in the tough city streets of Los Angeles. While there is no tumbleweeds or stagecoaches the Western atmosphere is felt throughout the film. Another thing I love about this film is the build-up and tension because the Action and big stand off doesn't happen until about 40 minutes into the film giving viewers enough time to know the characters and feel sympathetic for them when things start to go bad and when things start to go bad you are right there with the main characters. The two main characters Ethan Bishop and Napoleon Wilson are classic Carpenter characters because while the two are on opposite sides of the law both have one thing in common and that is to survive at all costs. Where Bishop uses logic and smarts Wilson uses toughness,smarts and aggressiveness to survive. Napoleon Wilson is was the first of many Carpenter Antiheros and a precursor to Snake Plissken in the Escape films because like other John Carpenter Antiheros Napoleon Wilson is tough and an individual who doesn't take crap from anybody and will stand up for himself. Although AOP13 is an Action film,the movie has elements have a Horror movie especially with the mysterious gang the Street Thunder who are mostly silent and emotionless bringing danger and violence to whoever they come across and showing no remorse. The presence of the gang give the film a creepy tone. The villains in Street Thunder were very much a foreshadow to Michael Myers in Carpenter's 1978 breakthrough Horror classic Halloween,because like Michael Myers the Street Thunder are silent,dangerous,violent and shows no emotions. The Action scenes in the film are great and well-done with great build-up and suspense and when the Action in the film happens is fast,brutal and sometimes shocking. The ending of AOP13 is great and is truly an ending that will remind people of Western movies. A great Carpenter ending.The whole cast does great jobs in their roles. Austin Stoker is excellent as cop Ethan Bishop,with Stoker bringing likability and strength to the role. Darwin Joston is brilliant as Napoleon Wilson,with Josten being tough,cool and collective in the performance. Laurie Zimmer is wonderful as Leigh,a tough gal that can handle herself. Tony Burton is great and funny as Wells,a fellow prisoner of Wilson's. Martin West and Kim Richards do good jobs as Lawson and Kathy,Father and daughter. Charles Cyphers(Starker),Nancy Loomis(Julie)and Frank Doubleday(White Warlord)give good performances as well.The direction by John Carpenter is excellent,with Carpenter bringing great atmosphere and a dark gritty tone to the film and Carpenter also does a great job with the Action scenes. Amazing job,Carpenter.The score by John Carpenter is effective,powerful,suspenseful and dark and adds to the to tone of the film. Excellent score by Carpenter.In final word,if you love John Carpenter,Action films,Thrillers or films in general,I highly suggest you see Assault On Precinct,a classic Action-Thriller that you can watch again and again and is Carpenter at his best. Highly Recommended. 10/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter may picture himself as a genre artist born an age bracket late, but his films can't avoid being influenced by the cultural, sexual and other side-taking strains of his restless era. Nothing exemplifies his apparently frenzied productivity more than his sinewy renovation of personal favorite Rio Bravo, a Revisionist Western to the extreme, in 1970s urban apparel, unashamedly old-fashioned in its simple ambition, although with the sunny composure of Howard Hawks' standard splintered beneath the import of Vietnam-era unease. Along these lines, Carpenter begins with the picturesque parallel rows of L.A. disturbed by the police massacring associates of a gang of street mercenaries, whose broad-based leaders, Che beret primed, are then seen imperially dunking blood into a bowl before setting out for retaliation. Against the explosive ghetto landscape is Austin Stoker's durable cop, whose desk-sitting post at the ready-for-graveyard eponymous precinct becomes an examination of bravery when in staggers the gang's target, an innocent nudnik gone comatose after wasting a member to take vengeance for his daughter. Off go the lights and phones, and Stoker and the station's squad, counting pokerfaced policewoman Laurie Zimmer and convict Darwin Joston, have to repel the external aggressors who, by this time, have metamorphosed into a systematic, case-hardened energy bleeding through the roller blinds.Indulging the blaxploitation and horror thriller craze of its moment, it's a cult film that's not as lofty or impressive across the board as some would have you think, but it has its droll and hardnosed moments of jolts and schlock. For all the outing's B-movie shroud, Carpenter's Panavision propriety, with accent on intermingling space caught in hermetically sealed halfway points, demonstrates a lucid severity to bring into disrepute many costlier, more "highly regarded" films, a hammering of conceptual, strangely expressive effects squeezed out of people chucking guns to each other, a bullet popping through a braided tyke's ice cream cone and into her chest, a police station cut to garlands throughout a hushed shooting gallery. Less revamp than reassessment of Rio Bravo's ideas while broaching its own of its time and legitimacy at the heart of a culturally jerky period: When Zimmer's charming enough shoestring Bacall puts a cigarette between Joston's terse lips and lights a match all in one motion, it's a flash of romanticized symbolic representations straight from Hawks, but coiled by the ironic insurrection of Carpenter's touch in terms of their conventional meanings.This is an excellent late-night movie, taut enough to keep you sitting up straight but trite enough to supply hay for teasing. John Carpenter's neo-Western is as primly efficient and austerely economical as anything the genre directer ever made. This thin premise of a police station that, the night before its shutdown, is beset by a mystifying band of hooligans identified as Street Thunder, Carpenter's young career accomplishment is at the same time a unsentimental and bracing action film and an able, finely hinted parable of 1970s ethnic frictions. From a conversation about coffee between freshly reassigned black cop Bishop and dauntless white officer Julie, to Bishop's anxious alliance with scornful white jailbird Napoleon Wilson, Carpenter imagines a station under fire from both immensely equipped goons and changing national attitudes. Not that social issues slow down the director's tableau homicidal stage sets, which include their stake of irrationalities, for example the agitators' tediously senseless efforts to break into the station through broken windows, making them trouble-free game for Bishop and company's bullets, yet however show a thrifty roughness typified by the notorious, feverish early scene concerning full-tilt Street Thunder members, a little girl, and an ice cream truck.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great 70s siege movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter has been hailed as one of Hollywoods best thriller, suspense and horror directors from the seventies and eighties. His high school project movie 'Dark Star' from 1974 received a lot of attention. Since then many of his movies were very high in substance but low in budget. Having low financial investment, it has not prevented Carpenter from making quality movies. Of late he has been absent from the film making scene and only making fewer movies than he used to. His recent 'Ghosts from mars' was appreciative.'Assault on precient 13' is a siege movie. This is truly a classic from the seventies. Shot in less than a month, Carpenter combined two themes to make one movie. He stated that this was more of a updated version of 'Rio Bravo', but in a modern setting. The movie also had a zombie movie atmosphere to it. The quality aspects are clearly evident as one would watch the movie. Carpenter's direction and the cinematographer have enhanced the presentational aspects. Many simple scenes give huge impact. Without a doubt the movie does have a thought provoking concept. It does indeed compel one to imagine what would be done to respond if a event like this ever did happen back then. Of course technology has progressed and advanced now but it does raise questions.SPOILERS Members of a police preicent and 2 convicts fight and attempt to defend for themselves after LA street gangs seek retribution for their fellow gang members deaths. To seek help proves difficult as they have no communication system. END OF SPOILERSThe movie has a moderate pace. With a running time of 90 minutes every segment proceeds meaningfully. Carpenter's background score is the heart of the movie. He has incorporated simple music and sounds that bring out the correct atmosphere. The movie has a haunting feeling which works perfectly with the theme.This is highly recommended to those who would enjoy thrillers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's modern-day ode to the Western (a reworking of "Rio Bravo"), "Assault on Precinct 13" occurs on an inner-city police station's last night in operation. This particular night sees the nearly abandoned precinct under siege by a local street gang. Inside, cut off from outside contact and backup, is a small group of disparate individuals (one cop, a secretary, and a group of waylaid prisoners on their way to death row) who are forced to band together or fall to the attacking gang forces. It's one of John Carpenter's earliest works, and it's an exercise in rigorous efficiency on a shoestring budget. The movie takes its time getting underway, with the real action not happening until the halfway mark. But it's not boring. Rather, it's a slow burn that fills the viewer with a mounting sense of unease. And that tension slowly gives way to dread once the bad guys start coming from all sides. All of this effectively set to an unexpectedly catchy - but eerily atmospheric - score from Carpenter.I have a strange attachment to "Assault on Precinct 13". It's not Carpenter's best, but it's a good bit of fun. Even though I've seen it before and even though it's a 35 year-old low-budget flick that seems like it should be boring, I'm still riveted by the gun battles; I still want to see these characters make it to see help arrive. It also helps that I can't get the main theme out of my head. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I must say this movie is very impressive considering it is of of John Carpenters first movies. Now except from some minor flaws in the effects and setup, this movie has some great characters, is well written, and has the atmosphere and suspense well known for Carpenter movies.There's really not much to say about the story, the IMDb synopsis speaks for itself and I'll just say; "See it", rather than go on spoiling the storyline.Now I loved this movie, it's very simple but effective, and I would personally put this on a John Carpenter top five movie list. he managed to perfect his directing abilities in his later movies, but considering this was among his first, I was really impressed. Plus, I'f you're a person which has little trouble with films with small budgets, in this movie it hardly shows, so don't worry. And of course the acting must not be overlooked, Austin Stoker as Bishop and Darwin Joston as Wilson was excellent.My verdict is 8/10 for the visuals (with the budget and Carpenters early abilities taken in consideration) and a 9/10 for the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have not watched Rio Bravo, so I hope you'll forgive me for not referencing it at all in this. With that out of the way... could the 90 minutes of this possibly have been any more intense than they are? I sincerely doubt that. I have yet to be able to look away from the screen when watching this. Carpenter knows how to make films, and obviously did even at the very start of his career, and not only that, but he knows exactly how to make them for shoestring budgets. This has got suspense and thrills enough to sustain several features. Fairly early, this tells the audience that it is not holding back. The action is excellent, and the unpredictability to it further helps the tension. Exposition and character(all of which are well-written and credible) development are delivered smoothly. The acting is pretty good, the only actually bad of it is by the kid, and expectations are automatically low for most of them, anyway. The dialog is great, and the one-liners are instantly quotable and memorable. The sense of humor is marvelous, no gag or joke is overdone, nor seems out of place. The atmosphere and mood are masterfully achieved. This is relatively disturbing. The plot is marvelous, and wastes no time. The build-up is flawless. The pacing is spot-on. The score is haunting, and well-done, as those John makes tend to be. There is some violence, but no real gore, nor much blood. There is also language, moderately strong, if little in amount. The DVD holds a director's commentary. I recommend this to any fan of John Carpenter and his work. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a slick little offering from John Carpenter that bears his typical stamp. It's very much a B-movie with a B-movie cast. But that's not to say that it or they are inadequate, quite the contrary. The movie itself gives a good run for your money, and the actors - although comparatively unknown or just barely familiar faces - do a very competent job with the characters they are given. Their unfamiliarity is, in truth, their best asset, because it helps to make them all the more ordinary and therefore believable. In short, a gang of young hoods are ambushed and blown away by police. Other members of this same gang have burgled an armoury and made off with modern assault rifles. Later a traffic-cop (Austin Stoker) starting a late shift is asked to baby-sit a soon-to-close police station - Precinct 13. Now, at the same time, a bunch of prisoners is being transferred by bus from one institution to another. Whilst also at the same time, a father and daughter are looking to visit their granny, but manage to get lost instead. And finally, the surviving members of the gang engage in a revenge blood-pact to assault the police station, and slaughter everyone or die trying. All of these various threads converge at precinct 13. The elements are brought together rather clumsily, I think, because of Mr Carpenter's comparative inexperience as a director (he got a lot better). There seems to be a lot of needless meandering. Though even then we glimpse the special Carpenter inspiration from time to time. The nauseously-nice kid mentioned above catches a bullet in the chest without any warning. It's one of the most shocking murders I've seen in a movie, who's industry usually holds childhood sacrosanct.Eventually, the disparate survivors find themselves under siege in the police station (and this time there's no Steven Segal). The sinister, spectral gang surround them and begin shooting. Their guns are automatic and are fitted with silencers. As a result there are no firing reports. An intermittent hail of bullets descends upon the building and all that can be heard are the whizzings and ricochets of incoming rounds. Scenes have a supernatural quality. The windows, blinds, and all the internal fittings, begin disintegrating piecemeal as if prey to some fickle poltergeist. Heaps of stationery take flight with a 'pop', light-fittings erupt, charts and pictures fall to the ground. It's a quite horrific scenario that seems to have a hint of 'Quatermass &amp; The Pit' or 'The Birds'. Carpenter plays it to excellent effect.One of the transfer prisoners is a notorious murderer, played nicely by Darwin Joston. He joins Austin Stoker's character in a fight for their collective lives. An actress called Nancy Kyes is especially convincing as a fractious and frightened telephonist. You can almost feel the jagged edge of terror in her voice. All of the acting is decent. The script varies from slick to slightly silly, but there are some excellent one-liners and situation comments. The tension in the precinct building develops very well as the anonymous phantoms converge, and keeps you guessing what will come next. Further grit is added by some wonderfully sinister theme music, which I believe was also written by multi-talented Mr C. Unfortunately, the ending is a little weak. Because nobody else appears to know what is happening (the wires are down), the survivors are left to their own devices.&nbsp;But it seemed to me that all they had to do was start a fire on the roof or upper story. That would have served as a beacon.&nbsp;However...I have only the video print (bought many years ago) and the image quality is, at times, so dark as to render some scenes almost indistinguishable. Perhaps the DVD is better; I've heard no comments one way or the other.If you haven't already seen this movie, give it a whizz. It may be flawed, but in my opinion it is certainly superior to his preposterously over-blown 'Halloween', with its indestructible bogeyman Micheal Myers engaged in a brat-slashing bore-athon that made John Carpenter into a household name. This, at least, is plausible. Moreover, one is induced to care about these characters, and that is what STORY is all about.The movie has recently been reincarnated as a more formulaic actioner rather than a horror film on the edge of supernatural. But what I would like to see is a digital remastering and tidying-up of the original - preferably by the man himself. Maybe even a 'Director's Cut'. It would take very little burnishing to make this shine as a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) gets an assignment to look after precinct 9 police department at its last day of being open. Same time on the other parts of the town, a convoy of guards and prisoners are being transported into a different prison, but after one of the prisoners gets sick, they have to pull over precinct 9, unknown it has been closed down. Two last elements of the story, a father with his daughter get in the middle of mindless gang violence and escape the safety that is precinct 9. The gang attacks the police department, and the people inside can only hope, that someone hears the ruckus before it is too late."Assault on Precint 13" (even tough it really is number 9), is a moody, thick layered thriller/horror movie. It's surprising and clever in many ways. John Carpenter manages to deliver quite an intriguing story with those pretty bare elements, as that's really all there is to this film. He doesn't even try to start explaining the actions of the gang thugs, they just attack and it is as mindless as it sounds, just as is the violence in this story.All in all, "Assault on Precint 13" is a great movie, with quite unusual claustrophobic atmosphere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I always enjoy John Carpenter's movies. His horror movies are by far some of the best ever brought to film.Most people think of Halloween when John Carpenter is brought up. But not many will actually think of his first big movie; Assault on Precinct 13.When people think of Assault on Precinct 13, they think of the 2005 movie with Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne. However, a good portion of the population does not even know about John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13.This is definitely a classic. The story is something that has not been seen on the big screen before it.A man runs from a crazy gang to an almost-abandoned police station for help, however, the gang turns out to be an unstoppable army and have set their sights on the police station. A long invasion/war ensues.Now with a good plot like that, you can't go wrong. But throw in an excellent cast and you have a classic. Austin Stoker was the best choice for Lt Ethan Bishop, he fit the part perfectly. Darwin Joston gave an unforgettable performance as the witty convict-turned-hero, Napoleon Wilson. Laurie Zimmer was perfect to play Leigh, the tough secretary. Tony Burton was excellent as Wilson's nervous, slightly insane inmate, Wells. Charles Cyphers was also great as Starker, the un-fearing officer. And Nancy Kyes was great as the scared, nervous secretary Julie.There was a limited but very fitting music score that really heightened the tension in some scenes.Many would bash this movie for the lack of action or lack of background, but that's what was intended. We aren't supposed to get much information and there was action, it was just very spread out.I rate this a 9/10. John Carpenter's reign of excellent film-making definitely got off on the right foot. Check it out if you like Carpenter's films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented Carpenter's box-set and watched most of his movies. I watched remake of this movie, and knowing Carpenter as a good director and seeing good mark on IMDb i hoped this movie will be at least as half as ''The Thing''. But i tricked myself...First of all acting in this movie is terrible, all of characters have wooden faces, without any emotions at all. Story is good, at least a part of it , but why , oh why would someone try to put prisoners in abandoned precinct when 3 blocks ahead is a new one? why would gang members without any cause shoot young girl and ice cream man? Why would hundreds of gang members run to attack precinct like some kind of animals, and get killed, and why no one had gun (when in the beginning of the movie it is said they stole lots of guns). Why would a serial killer sentenced to murder help defend precinct... Movie is full of flaws ... but in a way it's entertaining. Atmosphere is very good. Claustrophobic, like there is no way out, and precinct is placed in the middle of city...so good work for that. Soundtrack! I loved it. That theme, so spooky, it definitely fits good in movie. All in all , its a solid action / horror movie that will make one of your days shorter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's one quiet night for a policeman who's put on duty to look over a closing precinct which most of the staff have left and now at the new station. But soon enough all that changes when a bus of prisoners arrives to make an emergency stop and not too long after that a man stumbles into the building claiming that a gang is after him. Surely enough the unequipped police station is soon under siege by huge masses of street gang members and this is when the small handful of police must join forces with the few convicts to defend themselves from these continuous waves of attacks in one huge stand for survival.After hearing how great this flick is for so long and that they're never make these types of flicks again, I finally gotta around to seeing this highly regarded if slightly under the radar Carpenters' b-grade exploitation flick. And yep, it lived up to the hype quite impressively. I would actually hold it right up there with 'The Thing' that's for sure! Whenever somebody hears the name John Carpenter, most likely 'Halloween' or 'The Thing' pops in mind, but sadly this one seems to be an overlooked gem, although definitely not for those who get a kick out of his work. Especially from his earlier stuff, before he started his decline in the late 80's. After the very odd 'Dark Star, 'John Carpenters' second feature film was the stunner Assault on Precinct 13 (1976). What Carpenter had to work with was next to nothing, but hell he came up with an exciting, on-the-edge action-thriller that never lets up. You can only do with what you got and Carpenter makes the most of it here. The film's story is primly primitive and wears its influences on its sleeve. It could've turned out to be an satire really, but he steers clear away from it and delivers the action, suspense and dry humour in a nice balance. With those things only on mind. You can also see Carpenter's love for the western genre here by setting a traditional western in a modern environment, and Howard Hawks' 'Rio Bravo' is definitely a blueprint for it, but also a horror classic comes to mind and that's Romero's 'Night of the Living Dead'. The fruitful similarities are priceless, but don't think that it's a knock off that lacks ideas. The plot is hardly bullet proof with some holes appearing and silly situations occurring, but what really sets the film apart from the basic story is that of Carpenter's lively and articulated direction. He builds a real desperation and claustrophobic feel that really tightens up with such full throttle pacing and explosively raw action. All of this gets the juices pumping and hits you like a tonne of bricks. That really goes for the advancing synthesiser score that gets you really worked up and unrelentingly pays off. A great composed piece by Carpenter and I say it tops the 'Halloween' theme? gasp. It also doesn't hold back on the brutal violence and there's one shocking scene that sticks in your head soon after the flick has finished. Backing all this up is the fast-cutting camera work and kinetic editing that makes the movie's pace swiftly taut, but fly right by without bump. The sound effects have huge impact too with the hissing gunshots adding to the intensity that bellows from out of the speakers and screen. One of the films weaknesses would be the performances, they're rather stiff, but it didn't seem to bother me at all. That's because there were some charming if memorizing characters like Austin Stoker as the hard eyed police officer Ethan Bishop and Darwin Joston as the wisecracking jailbird Napoleon Wilson. The rest were pretty uneventful. Though Nancy Loomis and Charles Cyphers have small roles too. The acting might not be that of high standards, but they seem to work off each other rather neatly and click together, after the clashing personalities to begin with. The tight script is incredibly tense and it throws in enough revelations and sharp and tough dialog. You can call it a stretch at times, but Carpenter who wrote, composed and directed this shoestring picture with enough style and brute that tests the boundaries for its time. By today's standards it has dated considerably, but the finished product and results we get are plain hard to knock and the films' goals are fulfilling.In the ever-increasing remakes flooding Hollywood today it was no surprise that this flick got a reworking. Sure it doesn't match the impact of the original, but the remake has enough surprises of its own and makes for an entertaining watch nonetheless. I wasn't really that interested in it in the first place, but my friend made me change my mind from seeing 'The Ring Two'. Phew, that was a close one! For such a simple plot and miniature budget it packs enough wallop then that of most action movies who have a budget twice the size! For me it's exceptional film making that truly lives up to its rep.</fullReview>

The station is suddenly surrounded by a gang (uniting all races) who are chasing the crazy man, and cop and said party must defend and do whatever they can to survive the assault! Great performances by a largely unknown cast, and the film builds a feeling of suspense right through to the climax. Well done JC!

That's about it really, there are some nasty moments including the death of a small child which may not make it into many versions of the film, although it is rather ruthless, it can also be funny depending on your mood such is the cartoon-ness of many of the characters.He even manages to top the Halloween theme in my opinion, with this mental little ditty that sticks in your head.

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's second film is a major success. Assault on Precinct 13 is a gritty, urban, low budget, 70's homage to Rio Bravo with a tip of the hat to Night of the Living Dead. The basic plot involves a police station under siege by a maniacal gang. Simple as that, but so much more. Assault is brilliantly done. Carpenter utilizes some handheld shots, an awesome cast, and some fine one liners in this one. Napoleon Wilson is one of Carpenter's best mysterious characters and Darwin Joston does him plenty of justice. Much of the cast is outstanding; including Austin Stoker, Laurie Zimmer, Charles Cyphers, and Tony Burton (love this guy). I can't forget to include the music in my review. I love the simplistic and very cool vibe the music gives off. It's some of Carpenter's best work. The editor of the film is John T. Chance. That's Carpenter working under a pseudonym (and another homage to Rio Bravo). Another bit of John Carpenter trivia is that this is the first time he worked with Debra Hill. They would together go on to make some of the most memorable films of the late 70's and early 80's. Carpenter wanted to make a western this early in career and you can tell he still wants to (Vampires anyone?), so my question is...why hasn't he?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>`Assault on Precinct 13" was writer/director John Carpenter's third film, after the science fiction parody `Dark Star', and before `Halloween' made him a household name and a horror superstar. It has just been reissued on dvd, with all of the bells and whistles, but for most people, the best part is just finally getting a cleaned-up wide-screen transfer on this 1976 film.First off, there is no precinct 13 in `Assault on Precinct 13". There is just a nearly-deserted station house, with a couple of empty cells and some files left. Lt. Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), newly transferred to Los Angeles, finds himself assigned to babysit there overnight. He's disappointed; he's in the big city to catch bad guys, not sit on boxes.He's about to get his wish. An ambush the night before led to a shoot-out between cops and a members of a street gang called Street Thunder. The cops won, but others in the gang have decided to get revenge by assaulting the station house. They start by showing nothing is sacred, as a scene by an ice cream truck proves. The scene is violent, genuinely shocking, and shows that we are in the hands of a master. The gang begins sniping the station house just as a transfer truck containing a couple of death row inmates shows up. Soon Bishop and secretary Leigh (Laurie Zimmer) find themselves overwhelmed and outgunned, so they decide to let the prisoners, including the notorious killer Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) help out.That's it, folks. That's the plot. The acting is cardboard, character development is on the first-grade level, and the special effects are primitive by today's standards. But this film has something that all the CGI-encrusted films of the last couple of years can't match: tension, suspense, an escalating sense of fear, and gritty realism.The gang members slowly increase their force, and the phones in the station house have been disconnected and the power shut off. Other precincts get phone calls about shots being fired, but when cruisers drive by the bad guys recede into the shadows, making it look like nothing is happening. The gang members riddle the station house with bullets, then prepare to go in and finish off whoever's left alive. There are dozens of bad guys and a couple of good guys with few weapons and less ammo. The film ratchets the suspense until it reaches breaking point. Carpenter uses an early murder to show us that no one is safe, and we are putty in his hands until the violent conclusion.The film is still a classic because it still holds up. Carpenter uses the same techniques he used on `Halloween': simplicity and pacing are the keys to this one, as well as his own score, not as memorable as `Halloween's but still effective. The visuals are stark and chilling, helping to build a mounting sense of doom. This movie did action in a 1970s style, one that most of today's film makers should study. Escaping fireballs and dodging flipping cars is exciting, but not very suspenseful. Carpenter pulls the carpet out from under us with the first gang shooting and never lets up. This one is a marvel of pulp film making, and I dread the day when they announce the inevitable remake, with it's fireballs, flipping cars, and CGI overkill.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) **** 91 min.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dir: John CarpenterStarring: Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Martin West, Charles Cyphers, and Nancy Loomis.John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 is an action movie at its rawest. An amazing tribute to Howard Hawks' Rio Bravo. The acting is superb and pulls you into the story. This film inspired people like Quentin Tarantino and is actually often referenced in the film From Dusk Till Dawn which he wrote. It's often compared to Night of the Living Dead with it's siege type of plot where the people trapped inside fight the danger outside. One of the best parts of this movie is the score by Carpenter which is outstanding and helps with the dark, claustrophobic feel of the movie. Napoleon Wilson is also played with perfection by the late Darwin Joston. This character was obviously a pre-cursor to Snake Plissken in Escape From New York.Overall, this early Carpenter film is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) is one of my childhood favorites. A crazy film about all of the L.A. street gangs forming a pact so they can terrorize the streets together. When one of their own is killed and the person responsible enters a skeleton crew manned Police precinct the gauntlet is tossed and they decide to wage war upon the building.I love this picture. This is John Carpenter at his best. He managed to follow up his brilliant picture "Dark Star" with an urban western.

		<shortDescription>An action masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the best full-fledged action movie I have ever seen. Sure, John Woo has made movies much more action-packed than this, but Carpenter's unique and potent blend of interesting characters, good screenwriting, and an excellent soundtrack has had me as a follower in its cult ever since the first time I saw it years ago. In fact, I believe this overshadows "Halloween" in not just content, but also in overall quality. (I, for one, see "Halloween" as one of the most overrated films of all time.) The plot: A vicious street gang (with the wonderfully campy and dated moniker "Street Thunder") have acquired automatic weapons. They're holding the city in a grip of fear. When they kill one guy's little girl while she's standing at the ice cream truck, the father tracks down the culprit and offs him promptly. Daddy (now in a very deep state of shock) stumbles into a police station for help). This particular police station has recently been closed down, but still, Austin Stoker and some others are hired to hold down the fort until the fate of the establishment is officially sealed. (A very memorable line that gives food for thought occurs when rookie cop Stoker semi-seriously says that he wants to become a hero on the first night of the job, and then is met with not much other than a robotic voice on his radio that states simply, "There are no heroes anymore, just men who follow orders.") Pretty soon, when the father does make it to the soon-to-be abandoned titular precinct (even though it's actually precinct 6, DIVISION 13), hundreds of Street Thunder guys have followed him there. With the help of two hard-as-hell convicts, Stoker and a couple of secretaries are forced to wage a violent war with the gang, who won't stop until all inside the building are dead. Darwin Joston (who was in "Eraserhead"!) gives a stand-out performance as the sardonic antihero convict "Napolean" Wilson, my personal favorite character, who is all scathing sarcasm and really likes what he does when he gets a chance to clean up a lot of thrill-killing street punks. Action fans, attention: If you have not seen this classic of shoot-'em-up violence (made all the more unique by the fact that, amid all of the multiracial characters, not even a split-second is dedicated to any type of martyr-like racial commentary and goes balls-to-the-wall with its no-nonsense action thrills), make it your first priority NOW!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite John Carpenter films of all time. The way the film builds with the haunting original sore composed by Carpenter is just amazing. Carpenter loves the Western pictures of John Ford and it shows. Carpenter regular Charles Cyphers (The Fog, Halloween, Escape From New York) turns in a great performance as does Austin Stoker (Sheba, Baby. Directed by Louisville Kentucky's own William Girdler). The telling of the story in a docu-drama style is great touch. It follows the course of LA gangs laying waste to an almost deserted police station. If you want to see a modern day western (well, it was made in 1976) then this is one to see. This was Carpenter's first movie after UCLA film school. See this and feel the heat of the LA sun and be on th edge of your seat as we are introduced to some new anti-heroes that are somewhat of the predecessor(s) of Snake Plisskin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best independent movies ever made!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with HALLOWEEN (1978), John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976), when seeing it for the first time, is a masterclass of film-making. Utilising a similar style to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in making the lead actor a black man and transcending it's original source (a John Wayne Western directed by Howard Hawks, whom Carpenter regards as a prime influence for his work)it proves to be one of the most satisfying thrillers ever made.In the UK, however, the full widescreen version never gets a chance to bloom on screens, although the US DVD release purports to be the definitive edition. As a result, some of the images do get lost on the TV screen, but it is a testament to the direction and lean scripting of the film that the power of it is seldom lost, even in pan-and-scan versions.If, like me, you have seen it numerous times since originally doing so, you do start to examine more intensely the production values etc and it is a common fault of true film lovers that we are gluttons to pick out such things, when we should really just appreciate what we are watching.None of the actors (save for Tony Burton, who went on to play the trainer of Apollo Creed in the ROCKY films and Charles Cyphers who appeared in a number of other Carpenter offerings) made it after this film, but they can rest assured that they did provide a solid acting group with this film.Suspenseful, witty and brutal, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 belongs in any film fans library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>And his name is Darwin Joston! Seriously speaking, I was very surprised by this movie. I picked it up on DVD the other day after hearing about it for so many years and thankfully, I watched it knowing only the bare minimum of its plot. I won't give you many details other than that the story involves several people, cops and criminals alike, stuck in an abandoned police station under siege by gang members. It's definitely of the "what you see is what you get" variety. The film is low budget and it really shows. The thing that I really like about the movie is that you can tell it was a labor of love, made by people who love films. Sure the movie's low budget and all and some of the scenes are technically primitive but they did what they could within their limitations and crafted a film that is 100% entertaining. I love John Carpenter and even though I feel that he hasn't made a good film in ten years or so, I still feel that the man is a master film maker. I can't believe I hadn't seen this film up until recently! The characters in this movie are great and I guarantee you will be quoting this movie for days on end after watching this. Most of the classic quotes come from Darwin Joston, playing Napoleon Wilson. I thought Austin Stokes was great as well. The hell, they were all great! The score is also pretty memorable and sticks in your head (when the main theme of the movie starts up, I add my own lyrics, which consists basically of "assault on your mother" repeated over and over). I think what works best is the overall simplicity of the movie. It sounds like a corny premise but it works! There's a surprise or two occasionally and the movie never gets boring, I can tell you that. It never takes itself too seriously either, which is always good. It's an instant classic and if you're a Carpenter fan in the slightest and you haven't seen this, you owe it to yourself to.RATING: **** out of *****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping action/thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following the killings of several gang members by members of the LAPD, an interracial and heavily armed street gang go on the rampage. After the witness to a gang-murder runs into a police station about to be shut down the gang declares war on the station and now the cop, secretaries and inmates must join forces if they want to live.Despite its somewhat dated appearance and the cast consisting mainly of virtual unknowns I have to say that this is one of my favourite movies of all time. It has everything a good action/thriller needs in my mind and utilises all of its potential. ?Assault on Precinct 13' is gripping, intense and brutal but also manages to sustain a good social commentary and even has some more light-hearted moments, despite featuring one of the most shocking scenes in film history. The movie's soundtrack compliments the film beautifully even though there are only two real main tunes. The ?Assault on Precinct 13' main theme tune is dark, menacing and awesome in it's simplicity while the other major tune still remains menacing but adds a hint of despair therefore fitting the movie perfectly.Borrowing aspects from George Romero's ?Night of the Living Dead' (1968), John Carpenter is able to create a nightmarish setting with his own unique brand of suspense. This movie grips the viewer almost from beginning till end and is realistic enough for the viewer to be embraced by the movie itself. Though not entirely perfect in terms of the script and some of the interaction between characters, there is a consistent feeling of impending doom during the movie which helps to generate sympathy for the characters, particularly Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) whose own particular brand of dry humour helps ease the intensity of the movie at precisely the right moments. Also worth mentioning is the performance by Laurie Zimmer as Leigh. Despite being occasionally too wooden she seldom ceased to amaze me in her performance and it does make me wonder why she was only seen in one more movie? I think I shall have to hunt down the documentary ?Do You Remember Laurie Zimmer?' for the answer to my question.All in all this is an excellent film and is definitely worth seeing. While it isn't full of car chases, explosions and continuous loud gunfire that would appeal to the MTV-generation the action scenes in ?Assault on Precinct 13' are still gripping and intense. The suspense in the film is exceptional and almost on-par with Carpenter's legendary horror masterpiece ?Halloween' (1978). I highly recommend this to fans of action movies and any fan of early John Carpenter. My rating for ?Assault on Precinct 13' ? 9/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault On The Sensible.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A lot of people have critisised this movie, because they have missed the point of what John Carpenter was trying to do. He is so influenced by the westerns of the John Ford era, especially ones made in the '50s and '60s when Carpenter was young, starring actors like John Wayne and his ilk, that HE wants to make films like that. Which sometimes may result in wooden acting, as some have commented on. I think he almost...well, he did his own pastiche of Rio Bravo when he made 'Assault...'. In those old time westerns people didn't always show their true emotions. I particularly think that the scene where Laurie Zimmer's character is hit in the arm works because she is so busy pretending not to be scared, that she doesn't realise she's injured. Carpenter even took lines of dialogue directly from Rio Bravo; When one of the prisoners threatens to make a break for it, Austin Stoker says, 'I can't let you do that.' which is what John Wayne says to someone in one of his westerns. Let's not forget this is also an action movie, and people don't always act sensibly in those. 'Die Hard', another fave of mine, is full of mistakes I haven't time to type out right now. And the plot holes that someone also mentioned before? Well, as Carpenter didn't have a massive budget, he went overboard to be stylish, and I think he succeeded. He simply could not afford to film a massive police shoot out with hundreds of extras and cars. Also plotwise, the gangmembers would have been outnumbered in a shoot out. Gangs do not have helicopters as far as I know.As for Carpenter's brilliant music, I could sing his praises all day. Many thrillers beforehand like 'Dirty Harry', used jazz or even funk music on their soundtrack. But since then the likes of 'Beverley Hills Cop' and 'Stakeout' have had electronic scores. In fact, they became de rigeur for a while in movies.I'm not a blind fan of John Carpenter, and will readily admit that he's made some of the lamest turkeys out there. But when he made 'Assault...' he was just on the cusp of his talents. I certainly hope he returns to form.</fullReview>

This movie was made on a shoe string budget with a majority of unknown actors and actresses (Laurie Zimmer being the ultimate "What happened to her" actress of the 70's) Despite that, the story is solid, the focus is simple, the cinematography is killer, the action is great and the ladies are all babes.

		<fullReview>I remember seeing ASSAULT uncut on television back in 1982. I was a Carpenter fan before then, but he won my respect for this low-budget classic. How many exploitation films from the seventies are this memorable. It obviously got lost in the double-feature shuffle of gang and biker pictures. I won't go on about the plot. The atmosphere and ingenuity this film shows is the key. I've been a fan of this film for almost twenty years and consider it John Carpenter in his absolute purist form. Everything you need to know about this man's style is in this compact little 90-minute gem. Darwin Joston was very, very memorable to me. Back in 1984, I ventured to look in an L.A. phonebook and found Darwin's phone number. After all, how many people have that name. It had to be him. We had a wonderful discussion about Carpenter and the film. Darwin was shocked that I even knew who he was, let alone that I was a fan. He was witty and warm. I'm saddened to hear of his passing in June, 1998. He deserved better than Hollywood gave him. I'm sure that he had more fans than he realized. I hope his family realizes that. ASSAULT isn't the greatest film ever made, but it is definitely the best use of $100,000 I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As the director behind such horror masterpieces as HALLOWEEN and THE THING, John Carpenter's first shot at the action film is nothing short of amazing. Based on Howard Hawks' classic Western RIO BRAVO, the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is sort of an urban take on the genre but it succeeds quite well as a survivalist story.Police Officer Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) is about to have a not-so memorable night as he along with fellow cops and convicts must team up in order to fight for their lives. Hiding out in an abandoned police station, they are unexpectedly surrounded by a vicious multi-racial gang led by the sadistically homicidal Frank Doubleday.The lack of dialog and motivation certainly makes his character more menacing despite having a short amount of screen time. Of course, Doubleday's head warlord involves himself in the most controversial scene in all of cinema. The actions will raise a lot of questions like: Why is he doing these murderous acts? Why is his gang brutally attacking innocent people? We may never know, and frankly we don't want to know.Darwin Joston has been given one of the coolest names in movie history as slick jailbird Napoleon Wilson. The running gag involving Joston asking people for a cigarette may be considered an obsolete character trait today, but it stands as an example of clever screen writing on Carpenter's behalf.Armed with a higher budget than DARK STAR, the film achieves its realistic edge with unrehearsed choreography, resourceful editing strategies and the always remarkable Panavision cinematography. However, the slow pacing may turn off novice viewers who are more used to fast-rhythm action. But I think it helps build the suspense within the economical storyline.ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is a near perfect example of low-budget filmmaking and a template of what is to come from John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 was John Carpenters first studio film. It's a bit rough around the edges as would be expected from a first time director working with a budget estimated at $150,000. However, if your into B movies and enjoy yourself some grindhouse theater you may want to keep on reading and check out this film when you're done.Police in LA set a trap for some gang members and gun them all down with shotguns. The gangs in the city take a blood oath to seek revenge for the killings. We then hear a radio description about some missing weapons to help set the sceneThe gangs start terrorizing some run down parts of the city. They even gun down the poor ice cream man. After a man's daughter is killed he gets revenge by shooting one of the gang leaders and then half out of his mind seeks refuge in a police station Unfortunately for him that police station is being decommissioned and is pretty much mothballed at this point. A few secretaries and a couple of officers are all that remain at the station. Soon a police van on the way to a prison stops due to a sick inmate on board. While they are attempting to enter the police station the horde of well armed gang members attackThere was some serious tension up to this point in the film. The initial set up of the plot takes about thirty minutes, then the real fun starts. Due to being vastly outnumbered and outgunned Officer Bishop (Stoker) releases the two remaining prisoners Wilson (Joston) and Wells (Burton) to help defend the police stationWave after wave of gang members attack the station house and get blasted by witty shotgun wielding Napoleon Wilson, Officer Bishop and Hard as nails secretary Leigh (Zimmer). There are some great action scenes during the combat in this sequence. The witty dialogue, burning sexual tension between Wilson and Leigh and balls to the wall violence will impress fans of the genreWhile Stoker and Joston managed to land some minor roles in the future this film sports a fairly unknown cast. Joston supposedly landed the role due to the fact that he was John Carpenters neighbor when Carpenter wrote the script. Carpenter also wrote the score for the film as well as directing and writing the screenplay. While it sounds a bit like it was done on a Casio keyboard in someone's bathroom it fits in well with the filmThis film is a solid 1970's B movie and as such has attracted a bit of a cult following. Fans of John Carpenter might also want to view the film as a means of gauging his progression as a director. Assault on precinct 13 is currently available on Netflix for streaming and is available on Amazon in DVD format for under $10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just before the rise of the slashers and the rise of John Carpenter as a horror director, remember Halloween and The Thing he made this gem. After the SF turkey Dark Star it wasn't simple for John to proof himself. It is nowadays that he is much more appreciated then in the 70's. Even with the much acclaimed The Thing John was spit out by the press, The Thing was a flop at the box offices and failed to have a great support, well we know better these days, what a classic that is, the effects, but back to Assault. That one too was not a favorite of the public. It was a bit the time of cop revenge movies like Dirty Harry and Death Wish but Assault had one problem, the murder of a child in front of the camera. Even up to today standards that scene is explicit. But in his first major attempt you already can feel the atmosphere that he created for Halloween, the way he uses the camera and the score, excellent. Due the remake, won't bother to see it, the movie is now available at last. A must have in your collection.</fullReview>

In the first scene, the police ambush and kill several gang members. Later on that day, four gang members kill a ice cream truck driver and a little girl. The little girl's father is in a telephone booth and when he discovers his girl dead, he chases after the gang members and actually kills one of them. The gang then chase the father into an abandoned police station with only a few police officers and three prisoners. The gang cuts all the power in the area and begin an assault on the building. This is one of John Carpenter's best films, right up there up The Thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Siege battles have always been my favorite type of battle, there is just always something gratifying and exhilarating seeing few overcome or at least try to overcome against innumerable odds which seems almost hopeless. And just the sheer intensity of being alone against the world and whatever means you use to stay alive and win. This is my second favorite film from my favorite movie director John Carpenter, it's also one of my favorite action movies and films in general.This was his first silver screen film, I'd say it was one helluva start and has aged well over the decades, yeah there has been many movies and TV shows that have utilized this formula but this film, does it with perfection and I still feel is the best.I love the fact that it's done on a low budget which is fine by me because that helped give the film the right look and feel, it also feels like the filmmakers really put effort to their work. From the locale down to the enviorment it takes place, it feels like any place else that I've passed by. And as usual with Carpenter, this film has one of the best damn scores I've ever heard and is memorable. From the music that goes on in the film down to the theme song.I like the plot it really does feel plausible, makes me wonder if any gangs or crime organization might of thought of doing something like this in the back of their mind. The action is great, looks and feels realistic, doesn't look as though it was perfectly choreographed as any Jackie Chan film would, which gives the action a slight sense of unpredictability.The two protagonists Biship and Napolion (played by Austin Stolker and Dawrin Joston shame both didn't have more) are great like the chemistry between them, which makes this film also kinda a buddy cop movie, so in a way this film helped pave the way for future buddy cop films like "Lethal Weapon" and the underrated "Drive". Like in most those movies both characters are dynamic opposites and yet they have and form a bond. It's true that both characters don't have much depth, but you get little hints of depth which make them all the more interesting, sometimes what you don't say says a lot about a person and sometimes I find when you know a character so well they tend to be less interesting.Biship is the figure of authority but I think is pretty cool, just has sort of that easygoing attitude where you can easily be friends with the guy, I like his leadership quality the way he conducts things in the situation I can't help but feel he's can make Captain, I'd follow him. We also in one scene see Biship use to be a rebel and even lived on the wrong side of the tracks, just seeing him as a police lieutenant now just shows that not everyone that lives on those tracks turns out bad.Napolion is a figure of anti authority. He's rebellious, doesn't take crap from people that give him crap, a real butt kicker, but also kinda a passive aggressive type. But what I like is just the sense of mystic of his character, he is a death row inmate that has killed people but how he talks and the way he composes himself were not sure if those people he killed were really innocent. I also can't help but feel he could be an ex army or marine, just from the way he handles that shotgun, I don't know your theories are as good as mine but still you have to wonder.The Street Thunder are great opponents for the two, I really like how this gang is handled their scary because they feel like they could exist. It's true they never say anything in the film but it's really in their actions and behavior that make them all the more menacing; they have no movie for their killing, it's like these guys are just doing it just to have fun or mere boredom. I also like how their sort of like game hunters, in some parts of the film they don't do anything at first but when their moment comes you know they will. One scene which really disturbed me was when one member took out a sniper rifle and as they were driving by, this guy was either practicing or thinking of killing whoever walked on the sidewalk, I'll admit that was scary because it made me wonder it made me wonder if someone ever put cross hairs on me whenever I walk on the streets.What I like the most is the sense of suspense which is does great. I like the use of darkness in the film, it really creates a sense of unseen danger, that someone could just come out of the shadows or hit you and you wouldn't know where. The sounds of the silencers and where the gangs are positioned, but worst of all just the mere quiet really gave that sense of isolation, dread and sometimes impending doom. Assault on Precent 13 has plenty of ammo and firepower.Rating: 4 stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Assault on Precinct 13" is a deliciously sadistic low budget movie from schlock-master John Carpenter.The plot is simple: A black criminal, a white criminal, a black policeman and two women, attempt to defend an abandoned police station from a gang of faceless criminals. Why do the gang want to attack the police station? That's not important. Carpenter wears his George Romero influences on his sleeves, opting to treat the gang as a horde of mindless zombies.What the film does best is take the kind of sadistic pleasure one gets from bad, B movie westerns (cowboys holed up and slaughtering marauding Indians), and places it in an urban environment. Carpenter is a smart guy, though, and so thwarts any racist misreadings by making the bad guys a pack of multiracial zombies and the good guys a similar ethnic cocktail. End result: cowboys vs Indians without the guilt.Well, maybe not all the guilt. Carpenter goes deliciously over the top in a number of scenes. He has a little girl shot point blank in the chest and ends his film with seemingly hundreds of gangsters being mercilessly gunned down. It's brutal stuff, but pales in comparison to some of the more violent films that were commonplace in the mid 70s. Peckinpah and Siegel had opened the squib floodgate five years earlier, and from then on, seemingly every exploitation film and B-movie was ridiculously bloody, bullet riddled bodies the raison-d'etre to most of these underground pictures.Beyond the violence you're left with a couple of hastily sketched characters (Carpenter wrote the script in 20 days). None of them are particularly well written, but their monosyllabic prose and simple dialogue works in an archetypal way. Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo" is the template here, Carpenter trying to resurrect gruff cowboys for his urban frontier. 7.9/10 - Moody atmosphere, taunt action and a memorable score by Carpenter (who always uses electro and synth tunes to great effect) make this an excellent low budget actioner in the vein of "Duel", "Mad Max", "Terminator", "Day of the Dead", and "The Warriors".Worth one viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Hard-Boiled and Violent Action Thriller, One of Carpenter's Best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is, without any doubt, a filmmaker capable of making tense and suspenseful films that are straight to the point, and "Assault on Precinct 13" (1976) is one of the best examples for the man's talent for action-packed, hard-boiled excitement. Though arguably best known as a master of the Horror-genre ("Halloween", "The Fog", "The Thing"), Carpenter is just as great when directing Action films as films like "Escape from New York" and this gem prove. Carpenter's second feature-length film (after the 1974 Sci-Fi parody "Dark Star"), "Assault on Precinct 13" is a fantastic action thriller that was apparently done on a modest budget. Inspired (among others) by Howard Hawks' classic Western "Rio Bravo" (1959) and George A. Romero's masterpiece "Night of the Living Dead" (1968), "Assault on Precinct 13" is even named a Remake/Version of "Rio Bravo" on IMDb, but I would rather call it a homage. Set in the dangerous and crime-infested LA ghetto Anderson, "Assault on Precinct 13" takes place in a police station, which is about to be shut down the following day. Lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) is supposed to watch the station for a calm last night, when a prison bus containing three dangerous criminals unexpectedly comes in to stay for the night. A little later, members of "Street Thunder", the city's deadliest and most ruthless street-gang, who have vowed vengeance for the deaths of some gang-members, attack the building, unwilling to leave any survivors...The Rio Bravo influence is obvious - a prison/police station guarded by few men being attacked by a superior force of bad guys. The influence of "Night of the Living Dead" manifests in the nighttime setting in a single house, surrounded by malignant masses of seemingly inhumane fiends. The gang members are not humanized, but seen as a deadly force, much like the zombies in Romero's films. This factor increases the suspense immensely. "Assault from Precinct 13" is a very brutal film, not so much in the sense of being very gory, but uncompromisingly brutal. In this sense, it is arguably Carpenter's most violent film to date. The entire cast delivers good performances, Austin Stoker is very good as the hero whereas Darwin Joston fits equally well in the role of the Death Row convict Napoleon Wilson, one of the anti-hero characters that have sometimes earned Carpenter comparisons with Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. Laurie Zimmer is great in the female lead, I have no idea why she has only appeared in three other films; Tony Burton, Martin West and Charles Cyphers also fit well in their roles.Overall, "Assault on Precinct 13" is one of Carpenter's most effective and greatest films, and should by no means be missed by any fan of suspenseful, violent and hard-boiled action cinema. The 2005 remake is better than most contemporary remakes of classic films, but it still doesn't come close to the greatness of the original. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Essential John Carpenter B-Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter is the master of the B-Movie genre, making well-liked films such as Halloween (birth of the slasher film), Big Trouble in Little China and Escape to New York. Assault on Precinct 13 is one of Carpenter's best, and one of my favourites of his.In Los Andres gang-warfare is troubling the streets, and one gang was able to steel some advanced weapons to use for their mayhem. The gang, Street Thunder play revenge on the LAPD and swear a blood oath. On his first day on the job, Lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), is assigned to run Precinct 9, Division 13 police station, a station about to closed down, and running on a skeleton staff. At the same time Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), a prisoner on his way to death row is transfered, but on the way to a high security prison, a prisoner becomes ill and they have to stop at Bishop's station. In South Central LA, Lawson (Martin West) is searching for the house for his daughter's nanny. When he stops his young daughter buys an ice-cream from a van, and ends up getting shot by a gang member. Lawson quickly seeks revenge, killing one of the gang members. By doing this, he obviously get the gang hunting him, and ends up in the police station. The gang lays siege on the station, and the cops and criminals have to work together to survive.It's a simple premise and plot, and works as a suspenseful horror like film. The siege of an numerous enemy is very similar to George A. Romero's Night of the Living Dead and Dawn of the Dead. It is a short film, and very action packed. It is violence, as excepted, with a shocking scene involving a young girl dying. My DVD is rated 15, but I'm surprised it's not an 18 (and that is rare). The acting a little wooden, but it doesn't matter so much in this type of film. At least John Carpenter tries to bring some character and backstory, especially Napoleon Wilson who works as an anti-hero and a early prototype to Snake Plissken in Escape from New York. Some of the pacing is a little off, especially in the beginning. But Carpenter knows simple ideas, like cops and criminals working together to stop a greater threat, and action and set pieces.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Very Least Of Our Problems Is That We've Run Out Of Time ?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lieutenant Bishop is assigned to supervise the last day of an old precinct police station which is closing down. This dead end job turns into a nightmare when a catatonic man staggers in pleading for help, a notorious killer en route to Death Row arrives, and a vicious street gang besiege the building and avow death for all inside ...John Carpenter, like most of the best filmmakers, carved his career out of adversity. He didn't have connections or easy breaks, and he didn't make career moves. He clawed out his own path, without compromise, through skill, hard work and dedication. Assault On Precinct 13, his second film, made for the tender sum of around $100,000, is a complete masterpiece; one of the best movies of the seventies, and a stunning achievement given the resources he had available. Almost every other equivalent film looks cheap, features nudity and has dated badly. By contrast, this film looks sensational (it's in Panavision), features brilliant writing (by the director) and is timeless. The one criticism that can be made is that it's a little derivative; the overall story is highly original, but many moments come from other movies, notably Rio Bravo, Night Of The Living Dead, Once Upon A Time In The West, even a story from Richard Schickel's 1973 American Cinematheque documentary on Hitchcock. The characters all come from Howard Hawks archetypes - the good man, the philosophical outlaw, the gutsy girl - as do the survival rules; anybody who is stupid or cowardly dies. Early on, a superior tells Bishop there are no heroes anymore, but in fact they are alive and well in this mythology. In essence, Assault On Precinct 13 should be viewed as a modern urban western fairy tale; the street gang are simply Indians attacking the covered wagon, or waves of zombies converging upon their human prey. Early on in his career, Carpenter honed his love of mixing genres (see Starman, Big Trouble In Little China, Vampires) with his beloved auteur's theme of isolation - many of his movies feature sieges (The Fog, Prince Of Darkness, Ghosts Of Mars). What makes the film so enjoyable for me is his perfect sense of rhythm - events build up, the eerily effective percussion synth score ratchets up the tension, the story deftly manipulates all the main players together, and all the while the atmosphere of fear and disconnection grows. We identify with the situation and the people. The story is fantastic and yet plausible. The characters are real and yet stylised. It's a proper movie experience, made by someone who knows how to control us, and it works brilliantly. Equally impressive are the performances by the relatively unknown cast. The three leads are wonderful, Loomis (who also did the costumes) and Cyphers both score in the first of several roles for Carpenter, and Burton is great as the doomed convict Wells. Stoker takes the most conventional role but plays it with watchful intelligence, a rational but quickly adaptive hero. Joston is sensational as the enigmatic, self-deprecating Napeoleon Wilson, stealing all the best lines ("I don't sit in chairs as well as I used to."), and Zimmer is truly fabulous as the sensuous, quick-witted Leigh - I wish she had made some other movies. Her scenes with Joston in particular - like the moment where she gives him a much needed cigarette - crackle with frisson and humour. Carpenter is a puppet master, dancing these characters around each other, extracting all the value he can from dialogue, editing, photography and mise en sc?ne. He shoots in a grand traditional third person style, with elegant composition, smooth tracking shots and several fine set pieces like the shocking ice-cream truck murders, the classic throwing-the-shotgun moment (which comes from Red River), the ruthlessly cut shootout sequence and Wells' tragic escape attempt. It's a confident, polished, expertly constructed thriller which belies its humble origins and the inexperience of its makers. Trivia - editor John T. Chance is actually the director, taking his pseudonym from John Wayne's gruff hero in Rio Bravo. Remade in 2005 by Jean-Franois Richet as an agreeably different cop actioner. Perhaps I'm biased - Carpenter is my favourite filmmaker - but I reckon that shot for shot this is the most entertaining low-budget suspense film ever made. A must-see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another classic by John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After Dark Star John Carpenter wanted to a Western but for budgetary reasons he couldn't get to make a movie in the Wild West so he did a hybrid movie based on one of his favourite movies, Rio Bravo which was directed by Howard Hawks who John Carpenter was a fan of. Assault on Precinct 13 is classed as a modern version of Rio Bravo, John Carpenter even used the name of the character John T Chance as his editing name, Assualt on Precinct 13 is a great thriller and suspense film. It also has some great atmosphere and the music score which John Carpenter composed is one of my favourite pieces of music. Another thing I like is the mystery of the gang, you don't know anything about them except that they want revenge for the cops killing some of their members in an ambush. That gives the film a great tone since the audience doesn't really understand who the gang is.The film sees a gang named Street Thunder getting revenge on the police after an ambush, they go on the streets and harass a ice cream man and kill a little girl. The dad gets a gun and goes after them, meanwhile a cop goes to a Precinct which is closing down. A group of convicts who are being transported stop there, the Dad stops chasing the gang and kills one of them. Soon he finds loads all around the place and runs to the nearest Precinct there and soon the gang surround the place and begin to assault it, they hide in the darkness so no one can see them and use Silencers so no one can hear the gunshots. Nobody knows that this Precinct is under siege, The officer decides to let the two convicts out. Then they all need to work together to stop the gang from getting inside as they Assualt the Precinct.Assualt on Precinct 13 is a classic by horror master John Carpenter and should be seen. Check this out. 10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 9, Division 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Carpenter's ode to Howard Hawks, "Night of the Living Dead" amongst others is really well made on a low budget. Carpenter, I'm sure, has a metaphor regarding the youth drones who kill without emotion(perhaps making a statement about how he depicts America's descent into violence..has a potent point in our culture today, actually)together as a collective not afraid to die in the process.Clearly, Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson(really as inspired nickname which just works beautifully;he always promises to tell others who ask him how he got the name later)is a lovingly created character Carpenter came up with in writing the film and certainly seems to be the precursor to Snake Pliskin later in "Escape from New York." Napoleon is always asking if anyone has a smoke, but often no one does. He is to be transfered with two other prisoners, but one of them is infectiously sick so they stop off at a police precinct(Precinct 9, Division 13)operated by newly appointed Lieutenant Ethan Bishop(Austin Stoker;perhaps another "Night of the Living Dead" homage making a black man the chief hero of the picture as he is intelligent, courageous, and thinks well in difficult situations). Two other females are still working at the precinct as it is almost completely emptied in the move to another precinct. One is Leigh(Laurie Zimmer),a female perfectly molded from the archetypal Howard Hawks films who doesn't blink at danger coming her way and is not afraid to use a gun if need be. The other is Julie(Nancy Loomis), a telephone service operator who is not strong when danger is present which is why she will probably not be able to survive once threatening circumstances strike.There a sad irony to the whole conflict to the attack that circumvents on Precinct 9 against those unfortunate to be inside there. A little girl is shot point-blank by a gang member of the Cholo's..it's in a cold, non-emotional way which leaves a bitter taste. That curdling evil murder points out to us that the Cholo gang is completely cut-off from feeling anything remotely human. They simply serve their own cause to kill anyone that doesn't represent whatever cause they believe in. Why they do what they do is not explained which might drive some viewers crazy, but I think that doesn't matter much in Carpenter's whole grand scheme of things. Why did certain kids open fire on the school of Columbine? Why do killers attack innocents in the first place? It's not an easy question to answer. The dead girl's father kills the one responsible for her death and is targeted by the Cholo. He enters Precinct 9 so traumatized he can not speak. Hence, the terror lying in wait for those inside Precinct 9 commences.The film works from "Rio Bravo"(..or perhaps "Night of the Living Dead")in regards to our handful of heroes being trapped in a building against a legion of zombie-like Cholo gang-members. They are on a quiet street in an abandoned precinct(not to mention the location is in a violent part of LA according to how Carpenter sets his film up)against an onslaught who have so many stationed all over surrounding it. We watch as the heroes will have to use their brains to figure out how they'll be able to defend themselves with barely any weaponry(this precinct is cleared of most of it's weapons;the transfer was to be completed the very next day). Bishop will have to release Wilson and another prisoner, Wells(Tony Burton)after many were shot to death as they were attempting to get back on the prison exchange bus in the back of the precinct. Bishop and Wilson form a quiet camaraderie as they fight those marauders outside..there's respect here that isn't perhaps present when either are around their peers. Interesting developments occur between Wilson and Leigh as well. I liked this particularly because if you read between the lines they fall in love during the crisis, but speak without saying too much. Yet, they know how they feel about each other and need not say it out loud.The film works best as an action pic about which group will out-smart the other. The Cholo gang work well to try and keep anyone from noticing their strikes against the precinct. They remove all the bodies and any other evidence of their attacks. The Cholo gang is calm and methodical..they have a goal and do everything in their power to achieve just that. Our heroes inside have to come up with an intelligent counter-attack..and do it fast because they are the ones at the disadvantage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An all-out assault on logic. When I read the plot outline of this movie I had already smelled a rat.From the first minutes onwards I realized that I could wave goodbye to any chance of hearing good dialog here; but, okay, fine, this is an action picture. And then boredom set in; for some reason Carpenter decided to take his sweet time with getting to the point - namely, the assault on Precinct 13 - and this takes about half-an-hour. But before the assault takes place, Carpenter gives us a major taste of the absurdity to come: the scene with the little girl going back for a different ice-cream (but of course...) and then getting shot - just like that - by the gang; they shoot her for no reason and jeopardize their revenge "mission" that way. Dumb. The father of the girl then chases after the killers, only to reach and kill - of all of the numerous gang members - the one gang member who killed his girl (after getting shot, our vicious yet illogical gang member then falls sideways, like a tree). The father of the girl then gets chased by some other gang members and reaches Precinct 13 where he suddenly loses his ability to speak at the moment when he is trying to inform the Precinct's occupants of the danger they are in! Is this a dumb plot device, or what. Shortly afterwards, the Precinct gets shot at from all sides, the bullets shattering windows and thus making noise, yet Carpenter would have us believe that no-one could hear all that (and come to the rescue) because the gang was using noiseless guns. Dumb. The guns may have been noiseless, but I don't think there are any bullets in this world that will quietly shatter windows. From then on, it's strictly zombie material. Carpenterobviously saw "The Night of the Living Dead" one too many times and decided to do something similar. Except for one problem: gang members - and may they be as fanatical as teenie-boppers - do not act, attack, behave and brake through windows like zombies. They don't. And I don't care if they're high on heroine or belong to a cult-like organization: they can't behave like this. I mean, this gang is supposed to be totally kamikaze-like and irrational on one hand, but clever and organized in its planning of the attack, on the other hand. Carpenter wants to have his cake and eat it too. The dialog, as mentioned, is mediocre and gets even worse when the key characters start philosophizing in moments when no sane or insane person would even talk. The actors don't have it easy with this kind of dumb script - but the female lead acts so badly that she appears at times more zombie-like than the numerous invaders. Numerous; this brings me to the absurd numbers in which our zombie fanatics turn up. Are there millions of them?</fullReview>

Stoker's naivety "This can't happen" plays perfectly against Joston's laconic mass murderer (with his memorable introduction line "got a smoke?").The music is probably the best Carpenter has done - with the possible exception of "the Thing". Somehow very slow and easy, yet intense. "Tap-tap-tap...tap.

		<shortDescription>A true masterpiece! One of John Carpenter's best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) is a classic John Carpenter's action horror movie that still scares me today. The Action Is so raw it doesn't seem choreographed. So fast, It doesn't seem impossible and so intense you never ask what it's all about-you just hang on. Assault on Precinct 13 (1976) combines elements of the classic western and modern thriller to create a cult favorite-one John Carpenter's best films.What stands out is the dialogue and subtleties. the violence is kind of realistic in some ways and no one in show is like a superhero. In other wards, no one is really making some unreal shot with a firearm. Napolean Wilson (Darwin Joston) character is outstanding. I agree about outstanding character development in film. I recommend everyone watch this film in the dark. you almost feel like your caught up in the siege with cops and prisoners.A White - Hot Night of Hate! Assault on Precinct 13 is still one of my all time favorite classic action films that is very realistic and very, very scary today. I still enjoy this classic masterpiece from the Brilliant Director John Carpenter! Darwin Joston as Napoleon Wilson kick's ass! He kicks ass all the gang members to dust, he is most beloved heroes today!!! Austin Stoker as Ethan Bishop a modern cop who people does not respect, he is outstanding character of the police force I ever saw. Even the character and the plot of the movie is not realistic It still an action peace of the 70's. During the siege when cops were fighting and police station it always get me scared. I Love the performance and I love the character Napoleon Wilson also I love Leigh and Ethan Bishop. Classic 70's low budget flick from John Carpenter with plenty of shootouts and good action. Most of the film takes place in a single location at the police station but the standoff is very suspenseful and entertaining. It's sort of a modern day western set in the 70's California suburbs. The relatively unknown cast and music work very well.Before he hit the big time with the classic Halloween, writer/director John Carpenter gave us Assault on Precinct 13 a story about a cop with a war on his hands with an army of street killers and his only ally is a convicted murderer. A Siege happens and all hell breaks loose. A great B-movie classic from the late 70's that still stands up today and even the 2005 remake was done in good taste with a different twist then the original. I am really wondering if Napoleon did got the parole for saving Leigh, Ethan and that poor old man's life. I seriously I love this movie to death. There was even a remake about this movie Assault on Precinct 13 (2005) and it was good but comparing to this. The Original Is so much better.Police ambush and kill several gang members in Los Angeles. Gang members make a pact of blood to strike back at police, and conduct a siege on the police station which is almost abandoned and due to be closed. Staff of the closing precinct and the criminals being held there while in transit must work together to fight off the attacking gang members. That is the main plot about this action horror flick.The most scary vision is the main theme that John Carpenter performed for the film. The thing that's scared me here is the gang Street Thunder, when one of the gang members kills little girl by the ice-cream truck and the father Lawson (Martin West), pursues and kills with a handgun a gang member who cold bloody murdered his daughter and goes to the payphone to call the police a group of gang members are coming out of dark and he starts running in the station scares me so much.In shock, he is unable to communicate to the officers what has happened to him. That scene with gangs sieging the station scares me to death!!!! When the gangs are shooting on the police station with silencers scares me to death. John Carpenter put a lot of horror in the movie, more than he put action in it. I am giving this movie a 10/10 for realistic outstanding performance I ever saw and it deserve it! Assault on Precinct 13 is a 1976 American action thriller film written, directed, scored and edited by John Carpenter. It stars Austin Stoker as a police officer who defends a defunct precinct against an attack by a relentless criminal gang, along with Darwin Joston as a convicted murderer who helps him. Laurie Zimmer and Tony Burton co-star as other defenders of the precinct.10/10 Grade: A+ Studio: CKK Corporation, The, Overseas FilmGroup Starring: Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Nancy Kyes, Tony Burton , Charles Cyphers Director: John Carpenter Producer: J.

		<shortDescription>Huge suspense in a low budget siege flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early Carpenter classic remains a cult item and contains many of the things we associate with him such as a spooky atmosphere and some catchy synthesiser music. I'm finding myself liking a lot of Carpenter's films and this is no exception. It runs like a hybrid of THE BIRDS, NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD and a crime thriller, with birds and zombies replaced by faceless gang members. The similarities to NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD in particular become very apparent when you think about it: an isolated building under siege from an ever-increasing horde of enemies; a black hero; a finale which sees the survivors retreating to the basement.The tension here is created by a deliberately slow start which gently eases the suspense up to breaking point, finally bursting the bubble with a sudden bust of graphic violence - that of a young girl getting shot to death. From then on it turns into an increasingly desperate life or death battle between the inhabitants of the abandoned police station and the hordes of gang members. The acting is actually very good here, a surprise as most of the cast were never heard of to begin with and never seen again afterwards. Stoker and Joston in particular are excellent as the opposing cop and convict who join forces. The charisma between these two tough guys is something to see and they really hit it off together. Joston has the showier role as a mild-mannered murderer but Stoker's subtle performance adds the depth needed to the film.The music is quite simplistic and yet still very effective, although not as exceptional as Carpenter's classic score for HALLOWEEN. After recently watching an uncut, pristine and widescreen print on DVD I was able to appreciate this film in all its real glory. If you like some of Carpenter's other films then check this one out, you won't be disappointed, and action and thriller fans should definitely spend a night with this one to see what exactly can be achieved on just a small budget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early John Carpenter classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault On Precinct 13 is a very good grindhouse action flick combining elements from western classic Rio Bravo and George A Romero's classic Night Of The Living Dead. John Carpenter did not have too much money to play around with on this production, but had total creative freedom and the end result is pretty remarkable. Austin Stoker is the lead in this film. He is a cop in an abandoned police station that is under attack by a vicious gang called Street Thunder. Street Thunder has taken a blood oath on the police for their fallen homeboys in a recent shootout. Against all odds, Stoker joins forces with his two convicted death row felons to repel the attackers. One of the convicts, Napoleon Wilson is sort of a precursor to the Snake Plisken character. Actor Darwin Jostin does great in the antihero role and plays it real cool and tough, much like Charles Bronson. John Carpenter also did the score as well and is very dark and brooding, bringing great atmosphere and building tension and suspense. The film moves at a slow pace and is gritty,dark and violent. Both direction and performances are excellent. Assault On Precinct 13 is a very tough film with hard hitting action sequences, but also has great suspense is very moody, dark ambiance and dread. The film is great and holds up. The modern remake of this film is complete doo doo and as much as I recommend this film, I recommend just as strongly to avoid the remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you don't love it at first, watch it again and you'll "get" what makes this movie so special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's something about 1976's "Assault on Precinct 13" that just works. It's something intangible, maybe the overall grungy look of the film, the simple story, the shocking primal violence or the ingenious plot but it grabs you, drags you to the edge of your seat and never lets go. In a crime-filled ghetto in South Central LA, the "Street Thunder" gang swears bloody revenge against a father who dared to stand up against them. Seeking shelter he runs to Police Precinct 13, which is about to close down. Only a skeleton crew of Lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker), Captain Chaney (Henry Brandon) and two secretaries, Leigh (Laurie Zimmer) and Julie (Nancy Loomis) remain. A prison bus drops off three prisoners at the station because of a medical emergency just as the gang begins its attack on the building. The power lines are dead, the electricity is gone, there is no backup and the officers are forced to trust the convicts with their lives.Like I said, there's something almost otherworldly about the film that gets you right away. This is a made-for-cheap movie and you can tell at times, but it's very suspenseful so you don't care. The way the zombie-like gang members relentlessly assault the building, the way they slowly pick off one hero after another and the way they manage to prevent the officers from escaping feels raw and real. There are no moments of fancy shooting or heroism, it's just desperate people shooting at anything that moves near the windows of the building and praying that the tide will eventually stop. When a glimpse of hope you still don't know if things are going to ease up, which made it even more intense for me. Is the movie going to give me a break from this tension, or is it going to be like real life, where more often than not it's your own wits that are going to be the key to your survival? As the clock ticks down, the tension inside the station keeps getting higher and higher. Maybe if they can make it to the break of dawn, the gang will dissipate and return to whatever hellhole spawned them. Maybe. The raw immediacy of the violence and the shocking deaths throughout the film hit you like a slap in the face. This movie, in the way that it is cheap and animalistic reminds me of the original "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". If those movies featured big special effects, a ton of gore and recognizable actors in a slick setting, it would be missing that palpable terror that you get from something as simple as the sound of a garbage can falling over in a dark alley as you're walking home alone on a quiet night. The fact that "Assault on Precinct 13" is so simple in its premise makes it feel genuine and makes it easy to relate to. I got a real kick out of just listening to the movie too. It's all set to an incredible score by John Carpenter, who also directed, edited and wrote the film.When I first saw the movie, I didn't really know what to think. It was just so unusual to see the abundant violence and while I found it very suspenseful, I wasn't sure if I liked it. After discussing it with a friend and hearing the reasons why people liked it so much though I became hooked. The way the film introduces horror movie-like violence into what should be a dramatic crime thriller, it just catches you so off-guard that you can't get it out of your head. And that score! Little details throughout too, like the way the Precinct is actually labeled "Precinct 14", the same way that hotels label their 13th floor "14" to avoid bad luck and the fact that despite being so lean it still manages to throw in a couple of good laughs sold me. Like many of John Carpenter's films, it's a film you really need to watch twice to appreciate but trust me, it's worth it. (On DVD, May 29, 2014)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was 7 in 1980 there was ON-TV which was the original pay per view. It was different than HBO because movies got there months before cable. It was there where i saw this gritty film. I didn't know the name of the movie but 2 early violent scenes stuck in my head because of the violent nature of it. Years later I saw the box cover and it looked creepy so I rented it and was shocked when I saw a scene that i never forgot (when you see this film you'll know which scene) and was surprised that John Carpenter was the one who directed this film. I watched with anticipation and loved the film. The acting is OK, but the story is well done for the budget he had (about 150,000.00). Very simple story to follow but well executed.I give it 7 out of 10 only because of some obvious goofs in the movie but well worth the viewing time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Assault on Precinct 13</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Low low budget exploitation thriller which was Carpenters first proper film after the seriously low budget sci-fi 'Dark Star'.Inspired by 'Rio Bravo' and almost any other old western really, this stand off thriller is one of Carpenter's best films for me. Again the plot is very basic but executed so well. A group of men, mainly police and convicts and a couple women are holed up in a defunct police station as a large gang of thugs lay siege outside. Your typical last stand against the bad guys. What works (like other old films) is the fact there isn't lots of fancy ass camera angles, huge explosions, tarty gun play and slow motion. Everything is created real time and with as much flare and creativity as possible, this always (well mostly) works out for the better visuals wise.I admit there are few sequences which do look rather hokey these days, when the hoodlums attack the station via the windows they don't seem to work out that's an easy way to get blown away. The final showdown involving an explosion isn't very glorious truth be told but its still acceptable.Hardly violent a tall watching today but back in the day there was a huff over one scene where a kid is shot virtually point blank. I can see why as it is a cold little sequence but these small quirks make you chuckle these days, adds spice to the film when you look out for the infamous bits.The cast really help this film it must be said. Was never really meant to do anything money wise methinks, or suppose to be classic film making but the cast really juiced up the film to cult status. Stand out players easily being Stoker as the loan cop, all that's left after the initial bloodshed. His stoic stern calm manner is the perfect leader, the perfect hero standing for what's right and true. Alongside him is Joston as the gruff tough ice cool convict who becomes Stoker's close ally. Joston's performance may be hammy by today's standards but its the perfect foil and is typical of many old classic western tough guys...'got a smoke?'For a film that plays out within the small confines of a few rooms the tension is solid, you wanna see what's gonna happen. Not much happening outside accept for the odd shot of hoods running around, action is small, fast and quick whilst visuals are enough to get the job done.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An early John Carpenter film. An about to be closed police station is besieged by faceless gang-bangers who'll stop at nothing to kill everyone inside. The disparate group of people under attack includes a novice lieutenant, several prisoners and a distraught father (his daughter had been shot by the same gang). Austin Stoker, Charles Cypher and Nancy Loomis head the cast. In one of the film's more graphic scenes, 12-year old Kim Richards gets an ice-cream cone and a bullet through the chest. The film starts slow and becomes a protracted gunfight. It's exciting, well-acted, and tightly directed. Loomis &amp; Cypher would appear in Carpenter's next film, the now classic HALLOWEEN. Carpenter not only wrote &amp; directed, but provided the slick music score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Most Transparent Reflection of John Carpenter's Filmmaking Style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A potent blend of kinetic direction, relentless action &amp; energetic performances, Assault on Precinct 13 is a severely underrated action thriller that grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments &amp; never lets go until the very end. Written, directed, edited &amp; scored by John Carpenter, it is one of the finest works of his career &amp; arguably the most transparent reflection of this director's filmmaking style.Set in a crime-infested ghetto in South Central Los Angeles, Assault on Precinct 13 covers a series of events taking place within the same day &amp; begins with covering three plot lines which later merge into one. On a superficial level, it tells the story of a police officer who, with the help of convicted prisoners, defends a nearly decommissioned police station against a ruthless attack by a seemingly unstoppable criminal gang.Written &amp; directed by John Carpenter, the film is gripping from start to finish and never loses its steam even in the moments that has no action. The screenplay puts up some really cool characters on the screen &amp; it is impressively performed by its cast of unknowns. Camera-work &amp; editing is nicely carried out. And the background score, composed by Carpenter himself, is pretty catchy &amp; effectively used throughout its runtime.On an overall scale, Assault on Precinct 13 is an endlessly entertaining, cleverly structured, frenetically paced, intensely exciting &amp; immensely satisfying independent cinema from the 1970s that manages to deliver the goods without ever letting its mediocre budget hinder its creativity or quality in any manner. Worthy of its cult status &amp; definitely worth your time, Assault on Precinct 13 is an explosive ride that you must hop on without even thinking twice.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A police station in the ghetto on its last night before closing down is turned into the Alamo when a gang lays siege to the place. The gang is out for blood and a lone cop (Austin Stoker) must defend the station with help from two prisoners (Darwin Joston, Tony Burton) and a secretary (Laurie Zimmer).John Carpenter's urban Rio Bravo is a low-budget classic. It's the first time we get what would become the typical Carpenter cheesy male anti-hero (Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson), with his smart-ass one-liners and "I don't give a ****" attitude. Joston's great fun, as is Tony Burton. Austin Stoker plays the traditional hero of the piece very well. The action is good and Carpenter does a solid job mounting tension throughout the film. The script, written by Carpenter, is good stuff with lots of great lines for everybody, especially Joston. It's really a fun action thriller and a sign of things to come for Carpenter. Oh and, despite the title, the precinct in the movie is 9 not 13.</fullReview>

This film ticks all the boxes ! I always wondered if the same abilities the gang had in the film - stealth, silenced firearms - had been used in the film The Warriors, which had a gang army of 100,000 members. How could you possibly win ? The music in Assault is simple yet effective, and memorable even today, probably including those that only saw the film once at the cinema.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13" has all the elements associated with low-budget independent films: a cast of unknowns, relatively cheap sets, and the director being his own composer and screenwriter. Yet this movie is great for several reasons.To begin with, the film's set up is brilliant. Imagine a police officer forced to defend a police precinct against dozens of hoodlums with the help of a secretary, who has no training firing a gun; a mass murderer, who he cannot fully trust; and another convict. That in a nutshell is the set up for this picture. Moreover, Carpenter makes this film work, because he plays the plot for all its worth by exploring how these complex relationships between the police office, the mass murderer, the secretary, and the convict all play out as the precinct comes under heavy fire and glass windows break everywhere.The second reason is the characters. One sign of a great film is when you already care about the protagonists within the first 10 minutes and are willing to stick with them all through this film. "Assault on Precinct 13" achieves that very effect first by introducing us to a likable cop Ethan Bishop (played with a subtle effectiveness by Austin Stoker). Then we witness two other great performances. The first is Laurie Zimmer's quiet, but brilliant, portrayal of the secretary at Precinct 13, Leigh, who can convey emotional states on screen without even speaking. Then comes a mass murderer Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) who is first chained up in the cell of Precinct 13 and then unexpectedly strikes up a friendship with Ethan Bishop and establishes a fascinating chemistry with Leigh which hints at becoming a romance. Joston and Zimmer's interactions on screen are one of the highlights of this entire film. What they do not communicate with words, they convey with complex body language and glances pregnant with deep meaning. There is so much chemistry between these two characters, even though they also have the defend the Precinct against an assault by some very scary hoodlums, that they despair over never seeing each other again.A second reason why this movie is so entertaining is because John Carpenter has accomplished something very rare in the movies: he has made the terrain in which the story unfolds into a character. The terrain is the forbidden, run-down, and striking empty Los Angeles suburb of Anderson, which frankly looks like a ghost town most of the time. Combined with this effect, Carpenter also creates an aura of mystery around the villains who launch their attack on the police precinct 13. True, we see the faces of a few hoodlums at the beginning and middle of the film. They could be the leaders of their gang, but we have no idea because they remain stone silent for the entire picture. Yet more often, I noticed how John Carpenter concealed the faces of the attackers. They were either film from a distance behind trees and in darkness. Or they were film at the point of being shot, with the result that they either concealed their faces in pain or fell from the windows before we got a good look at them. At one point, the gang even cleans up all the bodies with the result that we never get to study the faces of the dead. This aura of mystery that is built around the antagonists is deliberate. Human beings have always been afraid most of the unknown, largely because their imaginations are capable of conjuring up greater terrors than those which exist in reality. The Disney film Bambi (1942) recognized this human trait, which was why the identity of the hunters (including the one killing Bambi's mother) was kept secret. John Carpenter also wants to play on our imaginations so that we end up conjuring up in our own minds the terrors that plague Precinct 13 -- and he does a very good job at achieving this result.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the olden times when disco was fashionable and afros a legitimate hairstyle, Carpenter was actually a breathtaking revolutionary director. His debut feature "Assualt on Precinct 13" was somewhat of a game-changer in world cinema, even though cerebrally challenged it was emotionally enrapturing our subliminal fears, even today being one of the most tension-filled movies out there.Starting off with Carpenter's harrowing techno score it immediately instills a sense of dread, every time the key theme reappears recapturing emotions of powerlessness, confining viewers to gasp at the aimless violence. The key characters are thrown into their own bastille, having to fight off swarms of mostly faceless gang-members, whose bloody pact constitutes a death note to all ensnared without a rundown police station about to be closed. Several gang members are given a face, but none of them ever speak a single line, instead silent and overwhelming ominous presence lurking just outside the building's confines (making them almost surrogates of zombies, as if Carpenter wanted to present his take on "The Night of the Living Dead"). Within it an honest, courageous lieutenant Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) must enlist the help of a convicted murderer Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) and a bulky prisoner Wells (Tony Burton) in order to ward off waves of attacks by a ruthless gang all intent on killing a catatonic Lawson (Martin West), who avenged the gang murder of his daughter just prior to seeking refuge at the forlorn precinct.From the offset the whole grim reality is unsettling, troublesome, as a group of gang members is gunned down by a police ambush, in what resembled a ruthless execution, not a lawful attempt at arrest. This initial violence breeds further mayhem, as the comrades of the assassinated pledge a vengeful blood oath on all inhabitants of Los Angeles. This initial motivation is straight-forward and devoid of further constructs, serving its simple purpose as a nihilistic prelude to ensuing carnage. The blocks are set in motion, while Carpenter masterfully builds tension, slowly culminating with an attack on the precinct, after which focus shifts to the entrapped people within.A movie of its time, a far cry away from the studied perfection of modern action cinema, instead servicing a chaotic script with an anarchistic feel, where scenes may not be polished or often make obvious sense, but still mold together to create a masterful atmosphere. Carpenter's low budget action flick has tonnes of missteps and features awkward acting, but all these points of contention pale to the obvious thumping success of this skin-crawling thriller.</fullReview>

Though light on character background, this well directed and scored film is a winner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a pleasant fluke, probably</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter movies are like what would happen if your slightly "off" uncle had some "far out" idea and somehow got his hands on some filming equipment. They invariably kinda fall short of their concepts to some degree, but there's something endearing about them. Odd how this is the only thing of his to really get pigeonholed as a grindhouse/exploitation film when they're all cut from the same heavyhanded, gratuitous cloth, more or less.This one has the camp of the rest of his catalogue (one-liners, borderline painful performances, cheesy synth music), but it really shines on occasion. There's just something about thrillers from around this period, they're so taut and well handled; there are so many good ideas that were born out of necessity due to all the limitations they had to contend with. Not like nowadays, with constant shakeycam used to obfuscate action rather than stylize, and constant thumping techno music crap. It's a slow burn to get to the shootout, but that's fine; action doesn't matter much until we've adjusted to the mood of the film and connected with the characters, and in that regard it's perfectly timed. No bones about it, the highlight is the initial attack on the cops it spends so long building up to. It remains a pretty chilling scene as the debris of sprinters and shattering glass make more noise than continuous spray of the assailants' silenced weapons. Closer encounters, too, are handled with clarity and guts on Carpenter's part.Yeah, the plot is kinda stupid. So after they lose some guys in a police raid, this politically correct, multiracial gang swears a blood oath to kill the police... so then later, when one gang member shoots at some random pedestrians to test out his weapon, one of the victims escapes and hightails it to this nearby precinct; the gang follows, and raids the place. Wait, just to finish off the random passerby? Or were they like "well, now that we're coincidentally here, might as well exact our blood revenge"? Oh well. They might as well be wearing Indian head dresses; they don't really matter. The real antagonist here is the desolation, darkness and grain that has you scoping for movements in the bushes along with the protagonists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I probably saw this movie for the first time about three decades ago and it had such an impact I never forgot it to this day. So naturally as I relive my favorite films of the past I called this one up from my local library system. Way back when I had no idea who John Carpenter was, so seeing his name attached to the flick today just blew me away. The acclaimed horror master not only wrote and directed this mini-masterpiece, but also wrote the music for the haunting soundtrack. It's a pulsating, primal rhythm that perfectly complements the building tension inside an abandoned Los Cruces, California precinct, as a lone police lieutenant (Austin Stoker) teams with hardened convicts and a pair of female employees of the department to defend their turf and try to stay alive. One of the women (Nancy Kyes) doesn't last long, a victim of the crossfire between the opposing sides. However Laurie Zimmer's character Leigh carries on, exuding a trashy sexiness in close quarters with outlaw Wilson (Darwin Joston), and providing pivotal action in scenes when the lawless gang perpetrates it's wave assault against the precinct. Probably the coolest violent sequence occurs when the outlaw gang shoots up the precinct in a massive wave of silencer diffused gunfire lending a surreal quality to the picture, windows shattering in perfect time to the hail of bullets careening throughout the building. For me, the picture picked up right where it left off so many years ago when I first saw it, and that reverberating rhythmic beat will stay with me now through the remainder of the weekend. Not bad for a second tier action flick that aspires to so much more and delivers accordingly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not enough good things I can say about this film. I've long been a fan of John Carpenter though. Halloween, The Thing, They Live. Perhaps he is well known for what can be construed as "cult classics" but he does very good work. Not surprisingly at all is that as usual, John gives us a magnificent musical score that fits the film like a glove. I don't think this film works for people that cannot imagine a time without the internet and cell phones. If you don't have memories of a time before those two things, no offense intended here but...you're just not gonna get it! That is first and foremost important for someone viewing this for the first time. That is also the reason that this movie works as it does.If you know anything at all about the Cholo, you know right away why the cops are scared of them. If you have ever lived in the southwest of the united states anywhere from the 70's to the 90's, you most likely have heard of them. That alone adds an element of nastiness and utter despair. They are well organized, smart, calculated and they have superior fire power. They don't care how many of their brothers get killed, they will keep fighting no matter what it costs them.The situation is perfectly presented, you have a police station that is shut down, working on a skeleton crew and with no supplies and minimal arms. The power has gone out, it's night time and they are in the middle of nowhere. The phone lines are dead and there is a virtually limitless force of the worst gang that LA can dish out. They have plenty of bullets and expendable members for the fight. The obvious solution to this complicated problem is that the two criminals that are at the station need to take up arms with the police in order to survive the night. You can see somewhat how he used some of the basic ideas for this film in "The Thing" some years later.If you are a Carpenter fan or even if you're not, take the time to watch this, it's well worth it.</fullReview>

It also contains one of the most dynamic characters in movie history, Napoleon Wilson. With a nod towards Howard Hawks, Rio Bravo (Carpenter credited himself as John T Chance) and the ketchup violence of the 70's in full-flow, this is one of the great low budget thrillers of all time. Consider also the street riots that occurred in the UK not many years later and then the cultural impact of this film becomes even greater. Dark Star, Halloween, The Fog and The Thing, Carpenters other gems are just a notch below Assault On Precinct 13. Pity about the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had to post - 7.2 is a ridiculously low score for a genuine classic.John Carpenter made 3 classic movies in the 70's - "Dark Star" and "Halloween" are two, but this is the best. Funny, exciting and inventive it tells the story of rival LA gangs (white, Hispanic &amp; black) who join forces and put a police precinct under siege after the cops gun down their buddies.To make matters worse, the precinct is on the verge of closing down with only a skeleton staff and no ammo. Plus, they are holding notorious mass-killer "Napoleon Wilson" in their cells. The attacks on the station are masterfully suspenseful - the gang- bangers use silencers so all you here are ZIPs and PINGs as glass shatters and people fall dead. The inmates of the precinct try to find a way to escape but it seems like the gangs have anticipated their every move.All of this is orchestrated by another classic Carpenter synth score and the script is full of witty lines. Especially great is Darwin Joston who seems to be channelling the spirit of Bogart. It is such a shame Joston never went on to better things - he has the charm and pr essence of another Carpenter favourite Kurt Russell.All in all, a great adventure/thriller, and while I enjoyed the 2005 remake, it is an entirely different film that doesn't have the charm or individuality of the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some startling violence and a look at 1970s urban America through the eyes of John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some folks might refer to the original Assault on Precinct 13 as a "cult classic", but that's not right. "Cult" films are bad movies that nevertheless have something about them to which a small segment of people really respond. Assault on Precinct 13 is actually good and is the rare film that feels better now than when it originally came out.Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) is a police lieutenant who gets assigned to take over a precinct that's being closed. Almost everything and everyone has been moved to the new precinct that opens up tomorrow and all Bishop has to do is "hold the fort" until the building officially closes. Then a prison bus has to stop at the precinct due to a medical emergency. One of the prisoners is Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston), a death row inmate who's never specified murders were so remarkable that cops can't help but ask him about them. Then an older man runs into the precinct, in shock and unable to speak, and before anyone realizes what's happening, the precinct is under siege by dozens of street gang members seeking revenge for a police ambush that killed one of their own. With the phone and power cut off, bullets crashing through the windows and relentless gang members trying to get in like zombies after human flesh, Bishop, Wilson, a civilian secretary named Leigh (Lauire Zimmer) and another prisoner name Wells (Tony Burton) have to find a way to really "hold the fort" and survive the night.Going in you should know that Assault on Precinct 13 is a very simple story that relies heavily on atmosphere. If you want an action film where stuff is blowing up every 20 seconds, this ain't it. But helped by a striking musical score (also by John Carpenter), this movie creates a tremendous amount of dread and foreboding as it sets the scene and assembles its characters. Then when the violence begins, it starts with a wrenching suddenness that's much closer to reality than what you see in most action films. That gives the moments of fighting and death a surprising edge that can still shock you decades after the film was made.Assault on Precinct 13 also offers you something now that people wouldn't have noticed back in 1976. It's a real window into the cultural mood of its era. No film, of course, can ever really tell you what it was like in the past but it can let you see what folks thought and felt about the time they were living in. Running throughout this movie is a sense of dystopia, a sense that civilization is held together by only the thinnest strands and those strands are almost completely frayed. Carpenter, though, also captures the essence of social decline in Assault on Precinct 13. It's not just that things are going to hell. It's the sense that things deserve to go to hell. The threat in this story isn't from the outside, it's something from within society and looms as a replacement for the world as it is.For a low budget action film, Carpenter and his actors do a good job creating characters that are more than just heroes or cannon fodder. Lieutenant Bishop is straight-laced and by the book, but he's also a black man from the ghetto who doesn't feel alienated from his roots. Wilson and Leigh are both hardened souls who can't really let their guards down anymore, not even under threat of death. Wells embodies the "I'm just in it for myself" side of people who has to bend to the needs of the group. Even some of the minor characters like Starker (Charles Cyphers), the cop leading the prison bus that stops at the precinct, are allowed to be more than just pawns that exists only to service the story.Now, there is one scene where gang members run away and leave one of their own to be gunned down by a grieving father that makes absolutely no sense. And the big, explosive finale to the film is quite lame, especially when compared to the scope and intricacy of modern movie violence. But for a basic, low-budget action movie, the original Assault on Precinct 13 offers a whole lot more than what you'd expect or what you'd get from other such films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tight and taut little suspense thriller from John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't mistake "Assault on Precinct 13" as a masterpiece, because its far from one. The story, if paid attention to, asks the audience to stretch their imaginations once too often. There are multiple gaps in logic and the film is full of successive coincidences that could only happen in the movie. Who cares though? "Assault on Precinct 13" is a tight and taut little suspense thriller. Its interesting to notice that, before the heyday of Hollywood hacks such as Jerry Bruckenheimer and Don Simpson, action films were often very minimalist and devoid of too much flashy camera-work or editing. "Assault on Precinct 13" is bizarrely low-key when compared to the action school that would follow ten years later. However, its effective and rather unnerving just because of how basic it is (kind of like Carpenter's admittedly superior "Halloween" two years later).The direction by Carpenter is impressive as usual in his early days. He takes the simple premise and manages to make it engrossing throughout with the help of a very quick pace. The scenes inside the abandoned precinct are claustrophobic (if unfortunately under lit, the film is so dark at times it impossible to tell whats going on). The acting by the cast isn't exactly Olivier, but the performances have the type of brooding charisma needed for this kind of action film. The ending is a bit lame to be honest, it feels rushed and anticlimactic. Up until than, this is an entertaining and suspenseful thriller, as long as you don't think too much about the minor details.

		<fullReview>As the title suggests, I don't watch many thrillers, but I have to say Assault on Precinct 13 is actually a REALLY good film! I especially enjoyed the fact that it was mainly set in one location, and what really intrigued me was that the lead gang members of Black Thunder say not one word at all. I would have really have liked to have seen more build up at the start of the film, and a less of an abrupt ending, for example did the Napolean get a pardoning????? It would have been interesting to find out! Otherwise a brilliantly produced film, a credit to the film industry, definitely worth a viewing if you haven't seen it yet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Simple Formula That Pays Off</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A police station is closing down as a new one opens. But on the last day, a bus of prisoners arrives on an emergency stop and coincidentally a gang decides they will take over the station or die trying. Also, an ice cream man (Peter Bruni) is attacked -- probably because he does not know the difference between vanilla and vanilla twist.John Carpenter has many things that work and many things that do not. The line is roughly drawn at 1990. "Vampires" did not work and "Ghosts of Mars" definitely did not work. But this most certainly does.The story is great, even though it is quite simple, and expertly brings Howard Hawks' "Rio Bravo" up to date. The way the plot falls together seems more intricate than it probably is. Lt. Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) is great, leading his troops into battle against a gang. His troops being two secretaries and two prisoners. Can you trust prisoners to defend a police station with guns? There is no big chase scene or old west shoot-outs, even though there is a lot of gunfire. There is just the fear you get knowing that when you have no lights and no phone and are surrounded, there is nothing you can do but trust those you are stuck with. (In a sense, this is not unlike "When a Stranger Calls"... except gangs are a different kind of evil than serial killers.) I enjoyed this film, you probably will, too. Maybe I will like the remake when I finally get around to seeing it, though it would have to be a finely crafted film to match this.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this and expected to see a non-stop action movie, but I was far away from the reality with my expectations. This is actually more thriller than action. Sure, it's low-budget, but so is a lot of great movies. Anyway, this movie shows John Carpenters brilliance. Alongside Stanley Kubrick, he is my all time favorite director. Besides, he composes great music to his movies. The soundtrack is great, and increases the excitement of this movie. What's even more great is that Carpenter don't follow the same pattern as other directors do when they make movies like this. This movie is unique, as all the other Carpenter movies.Not only the direction of this movie is great, the actors make a memorable and competent work. Austin Stoker is greater than great and makes his character shine. So does Darwin Joston. His character is more comic and Joston sure can make a character comic and funny without seeming to be strained and without destroying the credibility of his character.If I have to complain about anything, it would be that the playtime is too short, this is 91 minutes of enjoyment and it would be able to be 'bout a half an hour longer without ruining the general impression. Anyway, with this movie, John Carpenter created a timeless masterpiece who would hold for generations if it haven't been for the low-budget which have made this movie forgotten. Unfortunately.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>promising professionalism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I didn't bother watching the recent remake of this film, because it was quite clear from its promotional trailers that the makers of that version hadn't really got the point.It's no secret that Carpenter got the idea for this film - and its essential ethic - from the films of Howard Hawks generally and Rio Bravo in particular. It's actually a very simple ethic, about being able to confront crisis without fear: assume that you're probably already dead, and then just do your job.Despite the fact that this is in many ways a very American ethic - it's implicit in the essays of Emerson and Thoreau, and in the fiction of Melville and Fenimore Cooper, it was the ethic that Lincoln lived throughout his presidency - It's not very popular among Americans. For instance, gung-ho war lovers like to pay lip service to the ethic, but they don't actually believe they're ever going to die, and all they want to do is cause death and suffering, even when it's not part of any job. And of course it doesn't appeal to touchy-feely types because sometimes dying and causing death are indeed part of the job.Of course, professionalism is only part of the issue; the real trick is recognizing when others need help, and when it's best to let them help themselves. That's the core of the relationship between John Wayne and Dean Martin in Rio Bravo: if Martin wants to straighten out, Wayne is willing to help; if Martin wants to go on being the town drunk, let him do so and be damned.This facet of the ethic becomes the pivotal point in Carpenter's film that leads the condemned murderer to decide to throw his lot in with the besieged police.I go on about this for a simple reason - this ethic not only forms the basis of Assault on Precinct 13; it forms the basis of the career of director John Carpenter. Scratch a little beneath the surface of any of his films, and it's there, crystal clear, in a dozen variation. Consider this in terms of Starman: The alien, played by Jeff Bridges, is a professional diplomat; he's here to say "greetings, earthlings." But since most earthlings are too scared to pay attention, then, even though dying, he's going back to the head office on his home planet to make his report. The earthlings can fend for themselves, and goodbye.Although there are variants of this ethic available in other cultures (for instance the Japanese samurai code), this essential form of it that Carpenter promotes remains intrinsically American (none of his professionals are committing suicide for it, which a good samurai needs to do in extreme situations). So it remains bewildering - and frankly a little sad - that most Americans, whatever they say about this ethic, refuse to live it, choosing to remain "secure" in their fears.Well, none of this would mean anything here, unless John carpenter were a good director and Assault on Precinct 13 a good movie. To be sure, it has some of the same chintziness and lapses of pacing one sees a lot in independent films made throughout the '60s and '70s (the most notorious of which being Romero's Night of the Living Dead). But there are some striking visuals, the cast of unknowns is certainly game to play their best, the action is clean and violent (actually very hard to accomplish in a low-budget independent film). If part of the film's ethic is professionalism, than Carpenter has to present his audience with a relatively professional job despite a lack of adequate resources. I think he accomplishes this.By no means the best example of American independent film, but a necessary beginning to the career of one of America's most interesting filmmakers of the past 40 years.</fullReview>

What more could a moviegoer want? How about the shocking death of a girl who just wanted some ice cream or her father's revenge as he kills that guy with the freaky hair from Escape From New York? How about watching grown men play potatoes to see who tries to hot wire the car and go for help? How about a scene where some twenty gang members are shot one by one as they try to come in the same four windows with the two shooters making action poses? Does it sound silly to you? I think it sounds like fun. Not as thrilling as Halloween, or as menacing as The Thing, or quite as fun as Big Trouble In Little China; but it is a John Carpenter movie and that is never a bad thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A series of seemingly unrelated events around the city of Los Angeles culminates in an explosive shootout inside a soon-to-be closed police precinct in an almost desolate part of the city. First there is a police ambush on a gang that ends in slaughter, a shipment of guns is said to have been hijacked, a father seeks vengeance on his daughter's killer, and a bus load of cons en route to a prison has to make an emergency stop - and they all wind up in precinct number 13 (actually it's precinct 9 division 13 if you listen carefully) and a stand off begins.John Carpenter presents the events happening in the story as clear as day, but the back-story is as clear as mud. Why did the father run into the police precinct instead of driving away? Why did the police kill the gang in the beginning? Why is Wilson named Napoleon? Why is it all happening as it does? The point is not that there is no point to it all and the film drops many hints as to the motivation of each party involved. The point is that just because you don't understand something, doesn't mean it can't get to you - In a big city like Los Angeles (and the whole world for that matter) all sorts of violence consumes and destroys people who had nothing to do with its eruption; who wanted nothing to do with it once it started; who didn't even want violence to begin in the first place. Also how such a calamity can make sworn enemies the best of allies and how it can make normal people turn into beasts.So, on one side this is an action movie about surviving the odds. On the other it is a study of irrationality and how perceptive it is. In the film, not one person (even the viewer) knows all that facts about why everything is happening as it does and that only solidifies the point. 8/10Rated R: violence and profanity</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gang violence and warfare in Los Angeles has hit an ultimate high. Police have taken extreme measures to stamp it out, killing gang members on site. The police are trying to find guns that have been stolen, which they connect to the gangs. Rookie cop Ethan Bishop has been given the task to baby sit Pricinct 13, which is closing down and relocating. While driving around, four gang members attack an ice cream driver, killing him and a little girl. The father of the girl hunts after them, killing one of gang members. They run after him, so he takes shelter in the Pricinct. Also arriving at the Pricinct, a bus with three prisoners are put into the holding cells so a doctor can look at one of the prisoners who is sick. Soon Pricinct 13 is under attack from the gang, killing all it inhabitants, with more members constantly arriving.Suspencful and tightly made, Assault on Pricinct 13 is a great thriller from the master director; John Carpenter. The walls of the precinct tightly enclose the trapped people stuck in this siege from the gang wanting blood. The attacks are fast paced and relentless, it seems they never will end. Though the attacks are relentless, its haunting when the gang members disappear without a trace, leaving no bodies nor any trace that they were there.Though made in the seventies, Assault on Pricinct 13 still holds relevance today. There is still gang violence, and Carpenter wonderfully portrays the randomness and pointlessness of some acts that gangs act out. There is also that undertone of people so eager to grab a gun before questions, and that gun control still is left uncontrolled.While a cast of unknowns; Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston and Laurie Zimmer all give clear performances. While the overall acting isn't so great, its still compelling. Darwin Joston gives Napoleon Wilson an eerie presence, a feared criminal yet still believes in chivalry and nobility.It's taught, suspenseful and compelling. Assault on Pricinct 13 is a must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a great 70's cult film. This movie features an awesome score, good acting, and lots of action. It's not really a horror film like you'd expect from Carpenter, but it is a really good action movie.Assault On Precinct 13 is about a police station that's closing down after many years. When a prisoner on a transport bus gets sick, the bus is forced to stop at precinct 13 so the other passengers won't get sick. While the other prisoners are in confinement, an L.A. street gang that's been terrorizing the streets launches an attack on the police. The cop inside is forced to let the prisoners help him fend the gang off.The story is really simple, and not a whole lot happens, but it really holds up as an action film. Carpenter's direction is flawless as usual. His blend of humour and drama really makes the movie fun to watch. See this before you see the remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Assault of Precinct 13" is a superb example of the roller-coaster suspense thriller. Like "Jaws," "Alien," "Aliens," and many others I can't think of right now, "Assault" is a film where the enemy's presence comes and goes, growing more ominous and scary with each successive return. Then it's presence is thrust upon the main characters, and there is no going back.There are a couple of flaws with the film: For example, a couple of the climactic showdowns aren't as crisply edited as they could be, and some of the acting is a bit wooden. However, that doesn't matter when you are watching a film that fully knows and understands fear and the unknown, and shakes you to the core.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Got a smoke?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've enjoyed most of John Carpenter's films that I've seen, but I've still only seen about half of the movies in his filmography. Watching "Assault" compels me to check out the rest of his work. It's a good, solid action flick that doesn't use any of the fast-paced, gimmicky B.S. that we see in a lot of today's action movies. As a matter of fact, I saw the remake before watching this movie, and while the remake is far from terrible, it's also far from a classic. It contains a lot of that MTV-style direction that we see way too much in movies today, and there are some plot twists thrown in (supposedly to "spice up" the film), which you can really see coming a billion miles away. The original, however, is a simple story and the beauty is in its simplicity. It centers on a small group of characters, but you really develop a closeness to each of these people, even the prisoners. The remake is simply another throwaway action flick that, thankfully, tanked at the box office. While the original "Assault" wasn't a massive box office success, it developed a cult status and thankfully so. It works on many levels. I even loved the score, which was composed by Carpenter himself. It's a great, memorable score and even after having watched the movie about 10 days ago, it's still pulsating through my head. The performances, though sometimes dry, are overall quite good. When I first saw Darwin Johnston on screen, I thought he was playing his character a little one-dimensional, but his performance gets better as the film plays along. Of course, I love his recurring line: "Got smoke?" Like Carpenter said, to today's standards, people may find the film a little slow, but I didn't mind the pace too much. There are some moments in the first act where I nearly nodded off, but Carpenter paced it slow for a reason. He wanted the audience to be taken by surprise when all the violence and action sets in. The infamous "ice cream scene" is surely a shocking moment, and a moment that a filmmaker would never get away with nowadays, but it definitely worked for the film. If there's one thing I have to say, Carpenter surely doesn't romanticize the violence in this movie. If you're a fan of good action movies that actually have good stories and nicely sketched-out characters, then I definitely recommend you check out "Assault on Precinct 13."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What $100,000 Could Buy In 1976</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's 1976 crime thriller ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13, in spite of some relatively minor flaws, is a fine film in any number of ways. It marked the director as being right up there with fellow "Movie Brats" of his generation like Steven Spielberg and Brian DePalma. And it also showed his ability to create a hugely suspenseful film on a budget that wouldn't even cover the catering on most mega-budget Hollywood films of today, or for that matter more than a few special effects explosions in the bastardized remake of 2005. By keeping it taut and economical, Carpenter showed what a mere $100,000 could buy in terms of great film-making in 1976.The setting is south Los Angeles during the summer of 1976. Austin Stoker plays an L.A.P.D. lieutenant whose first assignment in his new position is to oversee the closing of an aging police precinct building in time for a new one to open not far away the following day. It at first seems to be a routine matter, even as the precinct accommodates an overnight stay of brutal prisoners being transferred from one jail to another. But it soon turns into something far more dangerous when a father (Martin West) whose young daughter (Kim Richards) has just been killed by gang bangers while getting ice cream from an ice cream vendor seeks shelter after he manages to kill one of the thugs. Shortly after nightfall, local gang members of every type besiege the understaffed police station with every weapon available to them, including silencers. Stoker and the rest of the staff must not only rely on their own expertise, but the ability of the prisoners (including Darwin Joston and Tony Burton), to strike back and beat off the gang bangers.As is often mentioned, ASSAULT was written and directed by Carpenter as an urbanized reworking of director Howard Hawks' 1959 western classic RIO BRAVO (to the point where he also edited the film under the pseudonym of John T. Chance, the name of John Wayne's character in RIO BRAVO). But there's even more to this film than the mere paying homage to another director. The siege itself is structured in a way that is reminiscent, in terms of intensity and psychological horror, of other films as well--THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS. Although the dialogue between the prisoners and Stoker and the precinct staff isn't necessarily top notch (something that Carpenter always seemed to have a problem with even after this), this is a mere minor inconvenience, especially as he is able to maintain the tension of this simple story for ninety solid minutes through sharp editing and his own piercing synthesizer-dominated music score, milking his $100,000 budget for all its worth without letting its minuscule technical defficiencies show.ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 was made back in a time when Hollywood still gave audiences credit for having brains, and where a simple and well-made story that relied more on tension was far superior to monstrous explosions and ultra-graphic violence. It might be dated by today's standards, but its ability to keep audiences riveted hasn't wavered too much in the three decades since it was first released.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's a relatively forgotten gem from John Carpenter's past?so much so that for the past couple years I thought his first film was "Halloween!" That was 1978, I think. This film saw rebirth as a remake called "Assault on Precinct 13" in 2004/2005. That's not a very original title, now is it? Well, being the John Carpenter fan that I am, I felt the need to seek this one out. And, I'd have to say, knowing that it would be an extremely low-budget film from extremely early in Carpenter's career, I didn't have exactly the highest hopes for it. Luckily, it wasn't too bad.This film centers on a police precinct that is being moved from a very dead city to a more lively one. The community is largely abandoned, with the exception of a huge rampantly roaming gang. A few cops, a couple secretaries, and a couple criminals are forced to defend themselves inside the now-empty police precinct against the roving gang. The gang, mind you, seems to employ every young man in the city and they have the wherewithal to use silencers on their massive arsenal of guns.Here's the breakdown:The Good:--The action is fast-paced and intense.--The story isn't bad.--The film occasionally has a feel like that of a horror film or thriller?it's John Carpenter after all?and it works well to build tension.--The idea of the gang using silencers on their weapons is unique and again adds a feeling of a thriller to the movie?you can't hear what might kill you?you can only follow where they strike.--Genuinely humorous conversation from the criminal known as Wilson?he's witty as hell.Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:--The acting pitches and wanes in quality, but generally isn't too bad.--As with all of his films, Carpenter composed the music. It's not too bad, but not his best.--The use of silencers make for some rather quiet gun-fights, and the intensity of the scene suffers a bit. It's not abrasive and violent like these things usually are.The Bad:--A potentially fantastic explosion is ruined by an obviously low budget. The fire that should have followed it is queerly absent.The Ugly:--Little girl murdered for no reason.Memorable Scene:--When Wilson (the humorous inmate) points out how a prison official doesn't stand as well as he used to? and most of his dialogue.Acting: 6/10 Story: 7/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Cinematography: 7/10 Character Development: 7/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 8/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 0/10 Violence/Gore: 8/10 (very little blood and no gore, plenty of gun violence) Music: 7/10 Direction: 7/10Cheesiness: 3/10 Crappiness: 0/10Overall: 7/10This isn't Carpenter's best work, but it's not terribly bad, and it decently entertaining. A great film for John Carpenter fans and a pretty good action piece for anyone looking for a quick fix.(www.ResidentHazard.com)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An early film by John Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A solid effort from top notch grade B directory John Carpenter. It's a combination of modern western and action thriller. A precinct police station is due to be decommissioned at midnight but a group of cops and a few convicts on their way to Death Row get trapped inside when the station is taken under siege by a street gang named Street Thunder. The people inside are cut off from the outside world and have to fight to stay alive until help arrives. The cast if full of nobodies. Assault on Precinct 13 is one of Carpenter's earlier movies and although this is not one of his best but it does keep moving. The movie was remade in 2005.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all... - "Got a smoke?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even though the sets shake during gun battles and the plot is simpler than a Rubik's of all one colour, it still makes for a fantastic film. It epitomises the talent that can be extracted even from a low budget and shows that even simplicity can make for compulsive viewing. John Carpenter creates an amazing world of creepy background scores and ruthless gangland killers all hellbent on killing the inhabitants of a run down police station. It is a tense, dark and amazing thriller in which the location it is set in grips your nerves like a vice, it seems far-fetched that a cop-shop could ever be attacked, but the film does seriously highlight the possibility of such a problem, as it claims on the radio news at the start of the film, "If these people get organised nobody will be able to stop them." This emphasises this even more, and the overall impact of the film is brilliant. Yet, I only gave it 7? Well:It drops points for three reasons; 1) The remake is terrible, Hollywood glamorised crap, and has inappropriately ruined the impact and authenticity of the original. Ethan Hawke and Laurence Fishburne should be ashamed. 2) Like I said the sets rock, this doesn't necessarily harm the impact of the film, but it is still a problem, especially when the person on screen is unreasonably shaking from side to side. 3) I think that it was a bit too dark, and although this did ad to tension it ruined the viewing pleasure, because the majority of the time you cannot see what is happening.But overall 7 is an admirable score for a low budget film, and I think it can hold its head up high saying, " I did it, I entertained, and I am better than the expensive trash they put out in 2005." Watch it, compare and see...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Things to come</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Though the sort of movies that John Carpenter makes are looked down on by most "reputable" critics- and frankly most of his more recent efforts do look pretty weak- but as a director he has just as strong a personality as any acclaimed critics' darling. In this, his first professional film, most of his characteristics as a filmmaker (though not all of his skill) can already be seen. Like most of his best movies, Assault is basically a movie about a group of people who come under siege from a sinister, apparently unstoppable outside force. Here, in Carpenter's first stab at this scenario, this unstoppable force is an L.A. street gang with. Obviously the last thing Carpenter was interested in was anything resembling accurate sociology; the bad guys are closer to the zombies from George Romero movies than to any real gang- they're completely emotionless, care nothing about their own lives, have an apparently limitless number of members, and have an almost supernatural ability to appear out of nowhere. The movie gets off to a shaky start as cops ambush several gang members (in a very 60s touch that's typical of Carpenter, the police shoot them down in cold blood). This scene is disconcertingly amateurish, and with its shaky camera movements, grainy photography, and unconvincing stunts, looked more like something I might see as a class project than as a John Carpenter-directed action scene. Luckily, the movie improves dramatically on from here, leading me to suspect that the movie was shot at least roughly in sequence and that Carpenter may have been still feeling his strengths. In the scenes that follow, Carpenter shows his usual skill at building up suspense, as the gang prowls the streets looking for a target on which to vent their rage and the usual varied group of characters assemble at a police station that's about to be shut down. As I also found of his later Escape from New York, Carpenter's action scenes are solid but somewhat lacking in punch, though here that's probably due as much to constraints of money and financing as it is of talent. Since none of the gang members seem to have any fear of death, their attacks mainly consist of charging armed defenders and quickly getting shot. The acting is a mixed bag, ranging from poor to solid, but luckily the leading actors generally fall into this category. Like the film school graduate that he is, Carpenter makes plenty of movie references and in-jokes- the basic premise is modeled on Rio Bravo and Night of the Living Dead. One of the two heroes, a black cop, tells a story about his childhood taken right from an anecdote that Hitchcock liked to tell about himself, while the other hero, a white convict, uses lines lifted right from Once Upon a Time in the West. All in all, Assault is a nice reminder of a time when enterprising filmmakers could make low budget genre flicks that were lean and unpretentious, instead of the solemn and bloated big budget efforts that now seem to be coming out very other week (painful memories of Man on Fire spring to mind). As debut films (which I think this could be considered) go, it's no Citizen Kane, but it is an entertaining promise of better things to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Refreshing, Required viewing for any Action Director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having seen a lot of iffy movies coming out of Hollywood recently, I have become somewhat disillusioned by a lot of big-budget action movies that try to pad weak stories with artificial and improbable exposition.It was refreshing, therefore, to finally sit down and watch John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct 13 this week. A simple, highly improbable story told with an economy of words and set-up that I found really enjoyable. Sure, the first half of the movie crawls along at a snail's pace, and, sure, the events that lead to the characters being thrown together in prison are somewhat weak (my favourite being when the entire car full of automatic weapon-toting gangsters run into the night away from a lone middle-age man with a small pistol.) But when the action starts in the 2nd act, it all clicks and moves briskly towards the climax. On his commentary, Mr. Carpenter continually knocks his own efforts, talking about things he would change if he made it today. Considering that his recent efforts have included Ghosts of Mars and Vampires, I'd like to tell him that even a flawed, low-budget movie can be enjoyable. We do not need another I, Robot or Con Air in this world. Sometimes the simple ones are the best.Slow and amateurish, yes. But this is a film that is all lean and carries no fat. Should be required viewing for any one wishing to make an action movie. And the ice cream truck scene is the best, most gripping thing Carpenter has yet to shoot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Kick-ass Before-"Halloween" Carpenter Blowout!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before people started referring to the gifted John Carpenter as some kind of new Hitchcock; Johnny and his long-haired film chums cranked out this no-budget, Hawks-meets-Romero-in-Carpenter urban hell(with peak Carpenter syn th-music). PLOT : Faceless,cold-blooded-ass gang-bangers attack a police station harboring a babbling vigilante father. This 70's-ass cop station is shutting down, so guns are limited-and communication to the outside world is gone. They let the cons out of their jail cells to help mow down the zombie-hippies! This is Carpenter's best movie, and I would give my life for "Halloween"! DIALOGUE: Bad-ass! "I am an asshole,though." "Can't take everything away from me!" is worth the price of admission(5.50 bin at Waly-mart, by the way. Travesty.). The only clunkers come from stupid cops.Go figure. "Got a smoke?" rules as well! ACTING: Rough around the edges, at best. LAURIE ZIMMER: Too-hot. She gets shot in the arm and still shoots additional holes in gang-banger ass . Wonderful guns,too (wink wink). Darwin "Got a smoke?" Jostin: The coolest character in film-history, "Napoleon Wilson". He makes "Napoleon Dynamite" look positively nerdy!! He's a death-row inmate who is so awesome he gains the respect of a cop! Give the man a cigarette! Austin Stoker: Best at making a cop look cool since "Shaft". As for the rest of the cast.....let's move on. SCORE: Second best to Carpenter's masterful "Halloween". Amazingly simple, yet totally creepy. Synth and beat-driven...way ahead of its time, by the way. Seek out the CD, even though it costs five-times more than the great DVD. Do yourself a favor, you mugs! Buy both yesterday, if not sooner. SYNOPSIS: "Night of the Living Dead in the mid-70's Hood" This movie rules!!!Mind the three exclamation points, people! I'm not playing!!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Low Budget Touch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even when his films don't click with me, when I truly dislike the approach he takes, I have to respect John Carpenter's work. He makes movies that he wants to make (lots of references to Westerns -- gotta love it), and he does it the way he wants to do it. Assault is a nice little low budget twist on Rio Bravo (a film by the great Howard Hawks), and I enjoyed every minute of it.As far back as Assault on Precinct 13, John Carpenter showcased his trademark style and showed he had a ballsy move or two that I wish I could see just once in a big-budget new release. Oh well . . .I'll say it up front: Assault on Precinct 13 is a cheesy little action flick. I'm hard pressed to recommend it to those who grew up solely on big-budget action flicks (who are equally as cheesy, but more polished all around) . . . you know, the people who expect major explosions, huge action set pieces, and make sure the film meets the CG bullet quota? Sorry, it's not here.What is here is the triumph of stylized film-making over laughably small budgets. Assault doesn't have the money for Die Hard scale action, but it's packed with that John Carpenter charm that the low-budget world has come to know and adore.For those not familiar with John Carpenter's style, he has developed a unique blend of plot-ambiguity, tongue-in-cheek humor, odd-ball yet memorable characters, slow pacing, and a signature synthesized score. These trademarks, most prominently displayed in Escape From New York, date as far back as Assault which happened to be Carpenter's second film (note to self ? hunt down Dark Star and watch it).Despite the acting feeling a little unnatural and the character's backstory being virtually non-existent, I managed to get into the characters just fine, and even found myself forgiving the mishandling of the guns and the corny lines indicating character incompetence. I didn't care. I liked theses guys. Especially the unspoken mutual respect (dare I say friendship?) between Austin Stoker's character and Darwin Joston's character, and I really like how the two characters never really have a conversation negotiating the situation. "Yeah, I'll help if you'll pull some strings for me." It's life or death; there are no delusions regarding the certain death of not cooperating.On one hand, the characters are terribly underdeveloped; no back stories, no monologues explaining individual motivations, or any concrete plot points for that matter. We do get nice little idiosyncrasies and individual quirks unique to each character as well as a hint of their personality through the conversations presented by the siege on the precinct, and oh yeah, the precinct is under siege. Someone go outside and ask the gun-toting maniacs for a written explanation on the specific details of why they're trying to kill everyone.Assault could have been another forgettable throw-away action film along with its big budget and low budget brethren, but this is a case where a director's style elevates the material to something more (see also Sam Raimi's Evil Dead and Spielberg's Duel.) I don't recommend Assault on account of its action set pieces, its budget, its originality . . . I recommend Assault for the name above the title. Two words "John Carpenter."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter's best movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's horror movies are a notch above the rest for one reason: they make no sense. All of his infamous movies--"Halloween," "The Fog," "The Thing," and this one--work because he provides almost no explanation for what's going on. Whereas "Psycho" had a lengthy scientific explanation for why Norman Bates was a nutcase, "Halloween" just established that the killer was a nutcase and left it at that. Very clever.The nominal excuse for the assault on Precinct 13 is revenge, but that doesn't really explain the insane violence. There's no real logic, so you have no idea what to expect. Instead, you just sit back and wait to see what happens next. The gang members are almost phantoms--you just get a glimpse of hundreds of feet running through the bushes. It's very creepy, and incredibly well staged. The scene with the endless bullets pelting the room, while making almost no noise whatsoever, is an absolute classic. This is a movie that needs to be seen by every horror movie fan.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Night of the Living Dead with more plausibility as an action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wonder if anyone has noticed that this is a reworking of Night of The Living Dead? The African-American hero. The gang members who never talk. Trapped in the precinct. Even the attempt to get the car. This is not surprising when one considers the movies John Carpenter went on to do. The biggest difference is the ending, which is, as many have noted, somewhat anticlimactic. In this version of the story our heroes live, whereas in Night everyone dies.All in all, though, a fairly good movie. The scene involving the little girl and the ice cream man truly takes one by surprise. It's as if, up to that point, one is unsure of the degree to which this movie will take things. But once that scene explodes over its viewers, all doubt is expelled and we realize that no niceties will be seen and no realities will be spared (However, I do not mean to suggest that any level of gore exists within this movie. Just unrelenting action sequences.).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple, but effective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The storyline is very simple in this film, to the point of being basic - but it does incorporate other aspects that you would expect from such a genre. Set in the 70s, LA - you can imagine it is not a film for the weak of heart. The violence is blunt and up-front, but the suspense is carefully crafted to keep your attention, but does not make it boring, either.Nice balance between suspense, action and dramatic moments. If your not familiar with gang-mentality (especially gangs from LA), this film would make an excellent benchmark for you. I would definitely recommend it. It's worthy of spending an afternoon watching and you shall not be disappointed!Be sure to keep the young ones away - it's not a good idea to have them around when watching this film. It would also be a good idea to close your windows and doors - not because of noise - but because this film is very effective in creating a tense and fearful atmosphere - so keep yourself cosey!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter's revamp and resurrection of Rio Bravo and Night of the Living Dead is undoubtedly one of the best films of the last 30 years, and unfortunately one of the most overlooked. With the recent remake, (still haven't seen) hopefully more people will see this and recognise it as a modern classic. Low budget, unknown actors, tense, shocking and exciting, witty dialogue, shady characters, Assault is everything you would expect from a classic Carpenter film.A group of criminals are being transported to another prison by armoured truck when one of them becomes seriously ill. They decide to stop at the local Police Station to lock up the prisoners and see if they can help the man. However, the Station they stop at is closing down and there is only one cop and a couple of secretaries inside. The prisoners are locked up, including Napolean Wilson- a notorious murderer, while the cops decide what to do. The power has been cut off, but people will be coming in the morning to finally close the place. Night has just fallen. Meanwhile a man in a frantic state runs into the station but won't say what has happened, falling into a comatose state. The Station suddenly comes under attack, and looking outside it seems that hundreds of gang members with guns have started a war with the those inside. With no help and only a few weapons, the survivors- cop, criminals, secretaries must work together to stay alive, and perhaps try to find a way out.The two male leads of Stoker as the cop, and Joston as Napolean are both brilliant in the roles, unknown faces adding the the sense of uncertainty. Joston delivers his few lines with cool and even though he is a bad guy, he naturally becomes our favourite character. Stoker tries to hold everything together as the law, but realises this will not work. Zimmer is also strong as Leigh, delivering her lines almost passively or vacantly, almost as if she isn't there, but we sense the chemistry between her and Napolean. Burton, West, Cyphers and Loomis also do well in smaller parts, and all the cast deserved to go on to bigger parts. Carpenter creates massive tension again, the faceless enemy always outside, innumerable and even though there are cars going past and houses nearby, the gang is silent and deadly in their pursuit, ensuring that help will come. The guns with silencers are used to good effect, with papers spurting up into the air quietly meaning the cops sometimes do not even know they are being shot at.The dialogue is minimal, every character has little to say as they all seem annoyed with each other, having to work together, dealing with the situation with no time for pointless chatter which fills other movies. The lighting adds to the tone, everything is shaded, we can only catch glimpses of the gang outside and in, and the score by Carpenter is another modern classic along with his Halloween theme. The deaths are both quiet and shocking- we don't see what happens to Loomis, while the ice cream van part would have taken great bravery to even dream of filming- there hasn't really been anything like it since. Once again Carpenter makes a brilliant film, and while he would soon go on to make bigger box-office smashes, this one stands on its own as the benchmark of low-budget film-making. Many directors try to create tension and fear throughout their careers, Carpenter could do it seemingly without effort.10 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I wish Carpenter could still make 'em like this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>- A new Lieutenant takes over a police precinct on its very last night. Almost everyone and everything has been moved into the new station. It should be an easy night - just direct all callers and visitors to the new precinct building. But a series of gang deaths will make this night anything but easy. The gang wants revenge and selects the almost abandoned precinct as their target. The gang members have taken a blood oath to die if they must, but someone's going to pay for killing members of their group. With two secretarial types and two death-row inmates, the Lieutenant must fight off the gang's siege on Precinct 13 if he is to survive the night.- Assault on Precinct 13 may start a little slow, but once the action starts, it's kick-ass action all the way. It's not a perfect movie by any means. For example, much of the acting and dialogue are near laughable. But, John Carpenter makes up for this with a gripping, suspenseful story that rarely lets up. Carpenter is able to build atmosphere and chemistry between the characters - things I find lacking in many newer movies. The shoot-outs as the gang members come in waves at the building are flawlessly choreographed. While some of the jokes don't work, many are laugh-out-loud funny.- While I've heard Carpenter say that Assault on Precinct 13 is his modern day Rio Bravo, I think the movie has much more in common with George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. The similarities are almost endless:* Both movies have people trapped in a building. * The people in both movies are lead by a black man, something still rare in 1976. * The people are under attack by wave after wave of basically faceless hordes - be they zombie or gang member. * A character in both movies tries to make a getaway in a nearby vehicle - both with disastrous results. * Both movies feature a basically catatonic character that the others will protect for no real reason. * Both movies mix characters from different socioeconomic standings into a cohesive fighting force. * And so on.- While Assault on Precinct 13 may have its share of flaws, it's one helluva ride.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the heels of my cold, irritated, should-have-seen-it-coming-but-subjected-myself-to-it-anyway reaction to the shameful, unexciting, unsuspenseful remake of John Carpenter's "Assault on Precinct 13," I did something I should have done a long time ago--purchased the original, watched it, and was in a state of prolonged ecstasy and excitement for the duration of its running time. It had been years since I previously viewed the film, but it is an experience of lasting effect that sticks with you--from the monotonous, minimalist score (like "Halloween," its repetition gets under your skin), the crisp pacing, memorable characters, occasionally quirky dialog, and Carpenter's sheer mastery of building on-screen suspense, it's a movie that achieves a visceral intensity few of today's big-budget wonders can match. Upon my recent viewing, the similarities to George Romero's "Night of the Living Dead" were bolder (Austin Stoker looks AND sounds like Duane Jones; the station DID seem like that farmhouse; and the anonymous youth gang is easily the zombies' equal); yet at the same time, Carpenter's film is more economical, with a pace that never lulls into all-out-action or all-out-exposition for very long (granted, it is lacking in Romero's developed allegory), and the motives and personalities of the gang members are left fittingly vague (thus making their threat more monstrous). Against a pitch-black Los Angeles night, Carpenter creates a true sense of isolation and desperation that's surprisingly potent--this film inspires more feelings of heart-in-throat terror than most certifiable 'horror' fare. Matched with a strong atmosphere and setting, Carpenter succeeds in getting structured, memorable performances out of his nameless cast (though Darwin Joston and Tony Burton had small roles in "Eraserhead" and "The Shining," respectively)--Stoker as the level-headed policeman; Laurie Zimmer as a steely, monotone secretary; Darwin Joston as a convict who is as tough as he is funny ("Got a smoke?").In short, "Assault on Precinct 13" is Carpenter's true masterpiece. Just see it.</fullReview>

Before, I had already watched Escape from New York , The Thing, Big trouble in Little China, Starman and Halloween: who can forget Snake Plissken, MacReady, Jack Burton, Scott Hayden and Michael Myers ?Not only "Big" John ( as he's been called in France ) know the moves of a camera and the way to shoot the plans in a very fluid manner, not only he do his score himself (!!!) , but he also write his own stories and create his own style. Few directors know how to create a "fantastic" atmosphere ( when you strongly feel something's wrong or not natural ): he do it and make you "touch" the inexpressible thing, the extraordinary fact ! Assault on precinct 13 belong to the top films of his career, and, even if it is a low budget movie ,and even if it is not really a fantastic movie, contain all the ingredients which will entertain you with a true feeling of gratefulness: the audience is considered with respect ( a Carpenter quality, and we would like to find it more often anywhere else...). It's a "pure" movie, made to project you in another environment during an half an hour. Carpenter was highly helped by three strong actors: Austin Stocker, the black stubborn policeman, Darwin Joston, the white disillusioned prisoner, and the lovely Laurie Zimmmer, the courageous police station employee ( where is she now...? ). Those will be forced to fight together, and when this amazing siege story progressively will reach his climax, they will have changed because they feel they have lived their whole life in one night ! By filming his story in a "first degree" style, with no backward attitude, but with a great sincerity, Carpenter tell you a story you will never forget, and that's the reason why we go to watch movies !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A whole lot of shooting going on</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter's 'Assault on Precinct 13' is a simplistic, low budget but very effective action movie. A group of urban terrorists decide (for no reason made clear to us) to attack a near-deserted police station (actually in Precinct 9), and that's about it for plot; nor is the acting superb. But for tense atmospherics this film is close to unbeatable, aided by the proto-techno score written by Carpenter himself. Worth watching, especially in these days of formulaic action films that start with a big bang, end with a bigger one and carry the guarantee that the hero won't get killed. Carpenter, by contrast, throws away the screenwriters' rule book, and also dispenses with sentiment and spectacle; but the result has you on the edge of your seat. A limited film, but a good one nonetheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Tight Urban Western Nightmare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One last night in the life of a soon to be decommissioned police station, when Lt Bishop takes over the custodianship of the last shift in precinct 13 he never dreamed of the hell follows. When a barely coherent man stumbles into the silent station he starts the chain of events that plays like a modern day rendition of the last stand at the Alamo. Together with the last remnants of the staff and a few hardened criminals, Bishop must fend off the hordes of street thugs who have declared war on the station house.For his first major film John Carpenter really hits one out of the park. This cult classic is his nearly flawless take on the `last stand' motif where he mixes elements of his favorite westerns (specifically Rio Bravo) and a little exploitation zing for added measure. The simple script by Carpenter, which takes place almost entirely in one set, is a great action ? thriller with snappy dialogue (much of it uttered by the classic antihero Napoleon Wilson played with great glee by Darwin Jostin) and has enough action and thrills for fans of the genre. The editing is tight (again by Carpenter) and moves at a breakneck pace straight on to the last stand of the survivors. The music (yet again Carpenter) is a pulse pounding piece and a highlight of his musical career. It is amazing how one can make about five themes / pieces run the length of a film and make it work so well. The acting is dead on too with great performances turned in by the whole cast, the best being the Wilson character, an enigmatic felon with a slightly twisted and funny outlook on his situation and in life generally. Also of note are Laurie Zimmer (what happened to her?) who plays a steely eyed a square jawed receptionist at the station.One of Carpenter's best film and a highlight of the seventies that mixes urban thugary and exploitation (more specifically blaxploitation) films with a John Wayne western philosophy that runs fast and hits hard with a rousing conclusion. A must see for all related genre fans.Suspiria10 gives it an A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good entertaining action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked this movie. It is a very entertaining action film. It has a western action film feel to it. The plot and storyline work well with the given actors and their environment. Though the dialogue at times is shaky and the low-budget shines through on special effects (such as gunshot wounds and cheesy death scenes). At times this is obvious, but this does not really take away from the movie. A movie doesn't need to have elaborate or incredibly realistic blood and gore to be effective (especially an action film made in the '70s. Overall, it is an effective film. It keeps the audience engaged and that's all a film like this needs to do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is extraordinary for a few reasons...the music is great, it has a couple of truly great scenes...but mostly, it is extraordinarily silly, yet it works. The plot has more holes than a Swiss cheese, the dialogue is woeful, it is more melodramatic than a daytime soap opera, but somehow as a package it just hold together.

		<fullReview>The above statement certainly applies to the great John Carpenter. Always a visionary and an auteur, he has never been given the respect by critics he deserves. His films are always effective, and his constant themes of day vs. night and good vs. evil are perhaps the most important in film. In his first true film, "Assault on Precinct 13", John Carpenter demonstrates that he is more than just a Hawks aficianado. He has a command over the camera, the score, the dialogue, the works. In this film he has fine tuned everything to a T, and the results are amazing.This is the coolest movie ever made. Cool in that the dialogue, especially that of the protagonist Napoleon Wilson is THE most suave lines ever uttered on film. Forget Tarantino, Carpenter was the one who did it first. Every line Wilson says is gutsy and composed, and Joston's performance as Wilson makes Dirty Harry look like Cinderella. It is a shame Darwin Joston never really hit it big in films, because this performance is amazing. He is an actor with a presence rivalled by scant few actors, even today.For a debut, Carpenter's film has confidence and surprising direction. Carpenter was not afraid to keep the villain largely in the shadows, or to show a very graphic and intense death scene ("I wanted vanilla twist!"). Forget "Citizen Kane" or "Dances With Wolves", this is the directorial debut to end all debuts. Simply an amazing work from one of today's most talented directors. Don't miss it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Mid-70's urban nightmare that is at times merciless.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1976's "Assault On Precinct 13" didn't do too well during its initial U.S. release, but did receive some praise when released in Europe. John Carpenter's thriller has gotten some attention over the years; particularly right after he made "Halloween." "Assault On Precinct 13" deals with an interracial street gang's vow to destroy everyone in a doomed, closing police station. Possible SPOILERS: The beginning of the film shows several gang members being gunned down by police. Other gang members then decide to make a cholo (blood oath), but at that time it seems unclear who they are planning their cholo for. The gang members taunt and then murder an ice cream vendor, and in one of the most shocking scenes ever, shoot a little girl to death (played by Kim Richards, who did this film between her starring roles in Disney's films "Escape To Witch Mountain" and "Return From Witch Mountain.") The father of the murdered child (Martin West) comes across a gun, and chases after the car full of gang members. He eventually kills one of them, but the others chase after him. In the meantime, three convicts and a few officers stop at the precinct. The father of the slain child manages to come across the police station of the title, but goes into shock after going inside. The station is closing down and somewhat isolated in that section of Los Angeles, so weapons are limited when the gang delivers the cholo and an all-out assault on the people inside. Convicts and police join forces to attempt to save themselves, and each other from the gang's onslaught. "Assault On Precinct 13" suffers at times from its low budget, continuity errors, and arid characters that don't have a lot of character development, but I have found those things easy to overlook because the film can be interesting and exciting at times. Another thing that drags the film down with some viewers is the sometimes corny and tongue-in-cheek humor. Again, I can overlook this, and find the film entertaining. The film is a bit dated by current styles and standards, but I find this doesn't hurt the film. "Assault On Precinct 13" is a mid-70's urban nightmare, but continues to stay current with today's headlines of gun violence. The street gang members, hell-bent on killing, are cold and vicious. The police personnel are dry, and mostly without emotion as most police personnel are in life. Austin Stoker does a fine job as the lieutenant assigned to take charge of the closing precinct. I've read a few negative remarks on Laurie Zimmer's acting, but her character seems to be a woman numb with the routine of the precinct and trained for not being emotional in a crisis. It is true her character is rather dry, but when it comes to fighting off the gang she gives what she can. Her character gets grazed by a bullet, and like most women she seems to endure the pain better than a man would. The convicts are more colorful characters, and led by Darwin Joston's Napoleon Wilson character. Darwin gave a pretty good performance, and Tony Burton does a very good job as a convict on a losing streak. The rest of the acting is not too bad. Charles Cyphers does a fine job in the short time he's featured, and Nancy Loomis creates a dry and whiney character. John Carpenter made a well-crafted film, and it's easy to get caught up in the story and suspense. His original music is harrowing at times, and intense at other times. There's also a nifty shootout montage of the cops and convicts when the gang first attacks them. I've enjoyed "Assault On Precinct 13" several times now, and other viewers may also enjoy it if they don't expect too much. "Assault On Precinct 13" is a low-budget, mid-70's urban nightmare that is at times merciless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Carpenter: Auteur.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Carpenter shows again how to make a great film on a minuscule budget in his second feature film Assault On Precinct 13, a brilliant cult siege picture. With this film Carpenter begins to show his credentials as an auteur, with many of his themes and film-making techniques becoming more apparent. Here he explores his first use of ordinary people in extraordinary, even supernatural situations, with the gang members being reminiscent of zombies in George Romero's Night of the Living Dead. He uses Hawksian style compositions, fluid camera-work and an isolated, claustrophobic setting to create a suspenseful, tense, perfectly judged action flick. The creative mood lighting and brilliant Capenter score add to a highly accomplished bit of film-making and even if the characterisations, dialogue and acting seem a bit ropey by todays standards, it only adds to the film's cult appeal.8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>DARK STAR was decent, but by the time Carpenter put out ASSAULT, his skill was crafted. This movie has got to be the best action piece I've ever seen. With all the elements of horror, action, and western (and some slight humor), the film starts out with Carpenter's dynamic, enthralling electronic score. Scripted wonderfully, the performances are not bad, either, considering the novice cast. Entirely enticing, this movie should no be missed - Carpenter fan or not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The BBC decided it was about time to show John Carpenter's classic 'Assault on Precinct 13', and even though it's over 20 years old, it still frightens the hell out of people.The the basic idea of the film is that cops kill gang members, gang members seek revenge, gang members kill ice cream man and little girl, girls father seeks revenge, girls father kills gang member, gang members seek revenge, girls father runs into closing down empty police station, and then were back to the original story of gang members wanting revenge on police.The film is set in LA and draws parallels with the battles between the LAPD, the Sheriff's department, and the hundreds of gangs around metropolitan Los Angeles, and it really hits home with its 'to the point' acting and frightening violence, which for the first time in a long time looks correct in a film. The story is simple and there are no big names in the film itself, but thats maybe the appeal, because it doesn't need Oscar attempts at speeches or even award winning camerawork to look and sound good. One of the most impressive things is the sound effects, or lack of them, apart from Carpenter's haunting score, it is very quiet, all of the gang members guns have silencers on them and this gives you the idea that its a silent force the inhabitants of Precinct 13 are facing, and he creates a horrible claustrophobic feeling which he recreated in 'The Thing', as most of the film is set in the station.He also gives the gangsters a zombie like feel, if anyone has played Resident Evil 2, where the zombies are bursting through the walls and windows of the police station, then they will appreciate the beauty of the set pieces where gang member after gang member is picked off in bloody style by the stations inhabitants.It goes to show, you don't need a monster to create terror.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I originally saw this movie almost two years ago, when I was going through my "Worship everything 70's!" phase (everything in film anyway) and I immediately loved it and was hailing it as one of the all time classics. Now I've just watched it again a few times and Yes I enjoyed it alot and still consider it a damn good film!, but yes, there are holes, and I can see them now...(possible spoilers ahead...) I won't dwell on the holes in this film for to long because Overall I think it's good and most of you will already know what they are anyway, but these are the one's that stood out most for me - firstly, the lights, after being cut they promptly come back on, in time for a quick bout of shooting and then during the fight by the cells there off again, and then! straight afterwards there on again?!?. And secondly a word about Leigh, Laurie Zimmer's, "acting" I've gotta say it's one of the most lifeless and wooden performances I've ever seen, does she actually get Shot?... (I know she does but it's hard to tell from her "reaction") according to the Imdb this is Zimmer's one-and-only on-screen appearance in anything - and, from this performance, it's not hard to see why.On to the good stuff, John Carpenter's self-penned &amp; performed musical score, whilst being outrageously minimalistic, does a great job in creating the perfect, tense, atmosphere. It's so simple- Yet, so fantastic!, and I believe he recycled this in every one of his following movies.A word about Napolean Wilson, I know he's supposed to be this enigmatic, wise-cracking, dangerous sort-of-a character, but the majority of the time this doesn't rub off on me and he seems merely average, only a few of his one-liners work/do anything for me.BUT, for me, the whole film's worth seeing! because of one line near the beginning of the film, where Leigh is pouring Lt. Bishop a cup of coffee, "black?..." she inquires,... "for over thirty years..." comes his snappy reply, fantastic!, I love it!... it really is worth watching for that line alone, it really, really is!!A fellow Imdb user stated that this movie was "nothing more than 1 hour and 30 minutes Mechanical existance" and to a certain degree I agree, as I can imagine Mr. Carpenter, with a very small budget, going through and following the "How to make a gripping thriller on a low-budget" handbook word for word.Another Imdb user stated that "they don't make them like this anymore" -he was right and it's a crying shame... </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I voted "Assault" at 10, despite the film's obvious faults and limitations, as its strengths make it remarkable, both for its time and for its budget. Napoleon Wilson's lines are ridiculously brilliant, while the nightmarish vision partially fore-runs later films like "Seven" as well as echoing major social themes of our time. The unashamedly basic but memorable music stands apart so favourably from the corporate musical overkill of 99% of modern movies. To paraphrase Wilson, you can't argue with a confident film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>i saw this film years ago when I was a kid (the eighties) and never forgot it. It was the height of gang wars in the eighties (Crypts and Bloods etc.) and all you saw on the news and talk shows was gang violence. The theme of being trapped is always an effective one, and worked well in this film. It scared the crap out of me. And of course I never forgot the ice cream man scene. For the very few people who said it was not believable, think of all the children on the news who have been killed by drive-by shootings. And also keep in mind this film was made way before cell phones, so losing communication was very believable, and happened to the whole city of New York in 76, the same year this movie was made! Very effective and gritty in a seventies way(think Taxi Driver or Looking for Mr. Goodbar),before films got all pretty and had all this perfectly fake lighting and computer hocus pocus you nowadays.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Caught this one during its rerelease (which followed close on the heels of the phenomenal success of HALLOWEEN) and was pleasantly surprised. An always interesting premise (survivors barricaded inside a building, fending off a virtual army of assailants) in the right hands, and Carpenter handles the reins like a pro. Darwin Joston, who had a bit part in David Lynch's ERASERHEAD, is given top billing here and makes the most of it as a wise-cracking con. While ALIEN (which was a cross between Mario Bava's PLANET OF THE VAMPIRES, FIEND WITHOUT A FACE and David Cronenberg's SHIVERS) is often cited for its depiction of a strong female lead, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13- which came along years earlier- featured Laurie Zimmer as a tough-as-nails cop caught up in the assault on Station House Nine. Carpenter always seems to treat his actors with a great deal of respect (I can't think of a single instance in any of his films where I felt for a performer forced to do something embarrassing), and this is a perfect example: even the "throwaway" gang members who come climbing in through windows and sewers seem somehow well drawn. (They don't simply place their heads on a celluloid chopping block; each individual seems to be genuinely trying to take out the people inside the station: one guy manages to get off a couple of shots before dropping back out the window.) Suspense, rousing action, great music and solid performances from cast and crew alike make this, Carpenter's second feature, a must-see movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter's Best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first caught this movie on the AMC channel and I have to say that I was very impressed. I've always been a huge fan of John Carpenter ever since first viewing his masterpiece, HALLOWEEN (1978), at the age of ten. Now I can safely say that this is my favorite Carpenter flick ever!ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is one of those films where its low budget and amateurish acting actually work for it. While a big budget police exploitation film would've taken the easy route and thrown in all sorts of fancy effects and explosions, PRECINCT 13 is careful about which route it takes and was clearly written by someone not so intent on making an action-packed thriller.The basic idea of ASSAULT is this: A group of police and prisoners are trapped in a sleepy California police station while heavily armed thugs surround the perimeter and kill anyone who has the misfortune to step outside. When the few people remaining finally catch on they decide to fight back and leads to an exceptionally exciting last half.Admittedly, the first half is a lot more intense than the second, but that doesn't stop this movie from being a classic. It's genuinely unsettling in spots: Not least of all the brutal murder of a very sweet little girl at the hands of the gun-toting villains. However, while some would consider that scene totally irredemable, it gives ASSAULT a sharper edge that other films of its kind don't have. For once we're actually routing for the good guys and are unsure if they'll survive or not. It takes a very strong director to make that kind of considerable impact upon the viewer and that is why I feel Carpenter is so underrated. Sometimes admired, sometimes totally forgotten, this awesome police thriller comes highly recommended. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Homage to Howard Hawks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Preceint 13(1976) is a classic low budget feature film of the 1970s which paved the way for John Carpenter's status as a cult action/horror/SCIFI film director. Originally, the director had planned to do The Eyes of Laura Mars which was later filmed by someone else and instead did Assault on Preceint 13. Out of many film directors who have been influenced by Howard Hawks, John Carpenter is one of two people of which it is majorly apparent. Mixes a lot of elements from Night of the Living Dead(1968) with Rio Bravo(1959). One element from the former which appears here is the notion of faceless emotionless killers attacking an isolated and nearly abandoned building. An element from the latter is the hard-boiled behavoir and the odds against them approach. One of three excellent motion pictures by John Carpenter besides The Thing(1982) and Halloween(1978). The scene involving Kim Richards and ice cream is one of the most chilling moments from 1970s low budget films. The acting is good and the action scenes are well done. Sadly, two of the main actors have passed away within the last five years, and the main female actress hasn't been in a film since. A charismatic and humorous performance is given by the late Darwin Joston.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Carpenter at his best</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before modern horror classics like Halloween and The Fog...before he forgot his talent at a bus terminal somewhere...John Carpenter gave us Assault on Precinct 13, a wonderfully gritty film dealing with horrors that are all too possible. I don't even like action movies, really, but as the saying goes, I know what I like.A youth gang cruises the sun-faded streets of L.A. on a senseless, blood-soaked rampage. On their ultra-violent quest for kicks, the victims include--in a shocking and very refreshing scene--a pigtailed Patty McCormack-lookalike ("I wanted vanilla twist."). Meanwhile, Austin Stoker (Abby) is a police lieutenant sent to supervise a precinct house on its last day of operation. As night falls, the pack of thugs converge on the station with the intent of killing everyone inside--even if it costs them their lives. The result is a painfully tense bullets-and-blood standoff and a group of disparate characters fight for survival.In his prime, Carpenter, knew how to do a lot with very little. Assault cost a mere $100,000; it looks like at least double that amount. Most of the money was spent on camera equipment, and the result is a very professional-looking picture (though the much-lauded Panavision framing is lost in the TV version). The actors are all quite capable. I love the emphasis on the reactions and interactions of the characters. The two women are almost like two sides of the same coin; switchboard operator Nancy Loomis (Halloween) becomes hysterical, while secretary Laurie Zimmer becomes almost disturbingly calm.This film, I've heard, is a remake of Rio Bravo. I haven't seen Rio Bravo, but I have seen Night of the Living Dead, and I was quite surprised at the similarities. The hero is black; one character is semi-catatonic; there is a should-we-go-in-the-basement debate. And of course, there is the massive, silent, relentless enemy. Yet somehow, despite this debt, Assault remains an extremely original film, approaching brilliance in its own right. Granted, there are a few loose ends and unanswered questions, but it really doesn't matter in the end. It's called "suspension of disbelief." The only gang film you need to see, with a haunting synthesizer score you must hear for yourself. There should be more films like this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Assault' of love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Carpenter's sophomore attempt 'Assault On Precinct 13' has been a film sort of 'lost in time', merely tumbling around in the overcrowded and often lame world that is home video. Most fans of Carpenter's work have never seen his 'The Classic Western Meets the LA of Today' or what then was considered to be today back when the film was introduced to audiences in 1976. What a shame it is to because perhaps 'Assault' is the very ocean from which so many of todays's 'action films' stem from.With a budget of around $100,000 and a very tight shooting schedule of about 20 days, Carpenter and company managed to pull off what many consider a second-to-none action/western film. What makes the film so special? It's the fact that Carpenter has a real love and understanding of the subject matter at hand. Thus, knowing his limitations production wise, Carpenter once again establishes an excellent cast &amp; crew to make up for what he lacked in legal tender and time.Many Carpenter 'regulars' show their faces such as Nancy Looms (of 'Halloween' fame) stars as the 'deer in the headlight' frightened switchboard operator whom later bites the big one and Charles Cyphers (also of 'Halloween' fame) who plays the straight-edged cop Starker. Whom, also like Nancy Loomis doesn't make it through the picture without taking a few 'pops' in the ol' back. Also on board doing the films sound effects is long time Carpenter associate Tommy Lee Wallace. The very fact that Carpenter often tries to recruit the same group of actors and crew members to work with on his films has in and of itself become a style all it's own as well.Like many of the films in the late 70's this film starts out slow and is methodical. The very opening in which your presented with the usual Carpenter style synthesizer pulsation's and the way the credits slowly flash in red with a subtle black background, secretly encapsulating and setting the mood for the viewer as well as subtly giving a fortune of what is to come. You can't help but beware of the lurking dangers and suspense that will soon take hold.Cut to a beautiful sunny California day. Along walks a police officer that seems to be at the height of his day so early in the morning. Little does he suspect what terrors the coming night holds in store for not only him but also for the small band of others that will require his utmost attention and leadership skills in order to survive the hellish onslaught brought on by a vengeful gang called 'Street Thunder.' Now cut to a prison. Inside its cold and murderous walls sits a much feared and dangerous killer. A man who respects professionalism although not the law. Nor is he aware of the dangers soon lurking for him. Soon our two heroes' (or anti-heroes') fates cross when one of the escorted prisoners being transferred becomes extremely ill forcing the bus also transporting feared prisoner Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) to have to stop at the nearest precinct, in this case the very same precinct in which our aforementioned police officer, Luteniant Bishop (Austin Stoker) is in charge of. From here, the foundation has been set and soon the hateful onslaught begins. This forces the boundaries between Lt. Bishop and Wilson, as well as the other small group of people trapped with them, to either be set aside, allowing them to unite as one or to allow themselves to remain on different planes, thus ensuring their very demise.I am afraid to state much more than that, for I don't want to spoil the entire film. However, each character we are introduced to is very unprecedented and each is as important as a wall is to a roof in keeping the suspense and the overall story afloat. Everyone from the mysterious man that comes tumbling into the precinct after the murder of his daughter (Kim Richards) by the vicious gang, to the stumbling cops who near the end of the film, are being cursed by the audience for their incomprehensibilities.But what is no big mystery is the pure delight that is this DVD. No doubt the best format to which this film has never looked or sounded better. Given a new digital widescreen transfer (a first for this film) in its proper 2.35:1 aspect ratio, the film is clean and very sharp for such an outdated and low budget feature. The daytime scenes will have you sweating in your chair and the night scenes will have your eyes frantically searching for any signs of the 'Street Thunder' gang hiding in the bushes. If I were Carpenter, I would have been crying like a baby seeing just how beautiful this film can look given the proper time and care to transfer it correctly.While the film transfer is nothing short of spectacular, the audio is not as equally matched. Only mixed in 2.0 Dolby Surround, the audio is not what it could have been given a 5.1 or even a DTS mix. Still, though, I found it to be very effective with great bass response. Dialogue is always centered and clear. A vast improvement over the previous VHS incarnation. From the opening of the film you'll want to be sure to set your volume high as to enjoy the films great soundtrack.Extras are watered down to only a trailer and a chapter selection screen. The real highlight here however, is the audio commentary by Carpenter, which is very entertaining and informative. A definite listen-to for his fans.My parting thoughts: a fantastic disc for a very fair price. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard-boiled masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The phrase "It's a great movie" is overused. A lot of times it's put on a film that is good, or even very good, but often gets overrated because of how bad other similar films of its ilk are (see BIG, a very good film given "great" status because of how awful the other late-80's body switching films were).Well, ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is definitely several dozen cuts above the violent urban nightmare films of the 1970's. And you know what? IT'S STILL A GREAT MOVIE! This movie proves you don't need big name actors or much of a budget if you have an incredible story-point to establish tension and respect your material. In particular, this is the best use of a bad guy character-turned-completely plausible good guy in recent film history: Napoleon Wilson's the worst of guys, but he's not only a hero on his own merits here, but works perfectly with Lt. Bishop to fend off the gangs. I wonder if the idea for LETHAL WEAPON, in rough form, began while watching these two characters team up.I gave it a 9 out of 10, only taking a point off because the last 20 minutes are a little hard to follow. This one's a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Carpenter Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Carpenter's Assault on Precint 13 is simply about a group of people (most of them outcasts) trapped in an abandoned police station, fighting for their lives against all odds. Working with a ultra-low budget- reportedly 100,000 dollars, Carpenter's homage to old-school Howard Hawks western-type action pictures should have been just another silly B-movie. But it turned out to be an unlikely masterpiece.Though having striking similarities to other cult classics like Night of the Living Dead (the merciless and drone-like gang members are shown like zombies- with automatic weapons) and Rio Bravo AOP13 plays out like it its own crazy, whacked-out original vision. Sometimes more unbearably suspenseful than NOTLD, the film even is shocking and gut-wrenching today (notably the ice-cream man scene).That being said, this film isn't without its share of flaws. A lot of the acting is putrid, for example some extras seem to think it's okay to stare blankly into the camera like a jacka**. As well the movie's miniscule budget shows in some spots. However these flaws are easily forgivable, any film fan should be able to look past them.What really makes this film work is the documentary-type feel to the film. The ultra-real and brutal violence that occurs feels somehow like it's really happening, and refreshing in this era of glossed over and overly-stylized film violence.Overall a must-see, especially for fans of John Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was 10yrs old when this film was made,but i didn't see it until i was 14. The film made a great impression on me at that time and viewing it many years later confirmed to me that yes it was a great piece of film-making. The overall feeling towards the film was one of tension with its nerve jangling music beating as the heart throughout, to create a feeling that something menacing was always just around the corner. I don't agree with people who say the film is just an excuse for gratuitous violence as much of the so called violence is created in the mind and not actually on screen, much like the style used by Tarrantino. Looking at the film as a whole and not dissecting it too readily(yes the acting is dodgy in places and the budget minimal)makes you realize what a great job Carpenter made to make such a film so memorable in spite of the actors and budget and not because of them, as is such with so many of todays films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding Low-Budget early work from Carpenter</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is definitely one of my favorite all-time movies. Every thing about this movie I liked and would recommend it to anyone.The story is about a strange, suicidal gang of hoodlums that is ambushing a police station to get to the man that killed one of their members. The reason that the member is killed deals with one of the most shocking scenes I've ever seen and won't dare ruin it for you.Several times I have read reviews attacking the acting in this movie. I found the acting to be quite good myself, especially Austin Stoker as policeman Ethan Bishop and Darwin Joston as the killer on his way to death row that ends up helping Bishop to fend off the maniacal gang.The dark, claustrophobic atmosphere featured in this film is just perfect. Carpenter builds up suspense, and makes an already taut situation almost unbearably tense.Also the theme song itself is enough to send chills up your spine. Pretty much the same beat is repeated over and over, but it's effect is incredible.Another part of this movie that sets it apart from others is the gang itself. The gang doesn't smirk, laugh hysterically, or constantly spew out stupid one-liners as in so many other movies. The gang has no personality, says extremely little, and just lets their presence itself have the maximum impact.My rating for this film definite 10 out of 10. Would I recommend it? Yes, to anyone who even remotely enjoys this type of film and even to those who don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cross Between Night of the Living Dead &amp; Rio Bravo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Assault on Preceint 13(1976) is a well made independant feature film that does a wonderful job in blending the action and horror genre together for one suspenseful thriller. The main source of influence seems to be Night of the Living Dead(1968) with characters in the tradition of a Howard Hawks film. The acting is pretty good for a low budget action flick. The direction by John Carpenter is first rate.Some of the plot elements of the movie seems to forshadow Dawn of the Dead(1978). The film can be seen as a prequel to Escape From New York(1981). The scenes leading up to the shootouts are done with plenty of intensive and mind-numbing bravado. It gives a good indiction of hopelessness felt by people during that time period of the esculating crime spries that occured during the 1970's.Assault on Preceint 13(1976) is very good, but the director's next feature film Halloween(1978) would been even better as the director had not refined himself when he directed the 1976 motion picture. Some of the themes from this movie would appear in the director's later films like Escape From New York(1981), The Thing(1982), and Escape from L.A.(1998). Its a film that would put many big budget Hollywood action films to shame. Its probably one of John Carpenter's most overlooked and under-rated film of his career.The music of this motion picture is as good as well as scary as the score for both Halloween(1978) and The Fog(1980). The villians in the movie are portrayed as faceless cold blooded mad dog killers. Assault on Preceint 13(1976) also involves the murder of a young girl that's probably one of the most shocking displays of violence seen in 1970's feature films. The movie is one that makes the viewer enjoy the positives aspects of low budget independant movie making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A middling film marred by bad acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back to the good old days!That's probably a comment a lot of JC fans keep saying when they see one of his more recent movies. It wouldn't surprise me if the Man himself goes into retrospective mode from time to time judging by how BAD his contemporary offerings have been just lately.13, was one of his first true indie film following on from his marvellous Dark Star romp.13 is clearly a 70s remake of Rio Bravo, but don't let this put you off. What the story lacks in depth Carpenter makes up for with his trademarks of relentless tension &amp; drama.Basically the story revolves around the closure of Police Precinct 13 (Precinct 9 actually) and its personnel are being moved across town. In addition a little girl ends up brutally shot by a street gang, whose leader is later gunned down by the girl's father who then seeks sanctuary at said rundown precinct with the gang in hot pursuit.To add a little more interest to a routine script a gang of prisoners have also been rerouted to the precinct which only adds to the bulging workload of a very skeleton crew.And for the next 70 minutes the film is a concoction of gang raids, cocky prisoners in need of a smoke, secretaries wandering around looking suitably scared &amp; confused and a black cop trying to hold everything together.The action is good if you like seeing gang members being gunned down while climbing through windows or little girls been shot in the chest while buying ice cream. But it's the eerie tension that makes this otherwise routine movie rise from the dross, especially the night scenes.The only drawback is the dreadful acting by all &amp; sundry. Zimmer &amp; Kyes deserve a special mention here because they just stumble around the precinct zombie style as if they're desperately trying to find the script rather than an escape exit. The scene where Zimmer is shot in the arm but she just stares back without flinching really clued it for me.And I can't handout much better plaudits for the two lead male characters, Austin Stoker as the chief cop, tries hard but doesn't really make us feel all that bothered; similarly, Darwin Joston as the chief prisoner, Wilson, is too laid back for my liking, although he does offer some lighter moments.Perhaps the most memorable aspect of this movie is the music. Carpenter &amp; Howarth get out their synths and pound out a really menacing score aka Halloween.**/*****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>RIO BRAVO in the big city! SPOILERS!!!!!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is RIO BRAVO in the big city. In this film we have a african american playing the lead character/hero instead of a robber or drug dealer! This was a far cry from the biased hollywood race roles of the day. In this film we have the classic "small group of people against insurmountable odds" storyline. This project once again proves, budget size is not indicitive of quality. This film exudes quality, because John Carpenter works best with low budget "indie" style projects. Many of the people who worked with Carpenter on this film (ie. NICK CASTLE and DEBRA HILL) went on to work with him on HALLOWEEN and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK. This film is a good follow up to his USC student project DARK STAR. DARK STAR was bought by a producer and reworked into feature length...this film shows that Carpenter has room to grow and develop as a story teller. ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 also has some subtle racial elements. I enjoyed how the lead character tells about how he "walked out of the ghetto on his own". This film portrays african americans not in a stereotypical "UNCLE TOM'S CABIN" motif but as rational, caring, thinking human beings. Let's face it....minorities didn't have many action heros prior to this film, SHAFT and BILLY JACK. This film helped signal the end of a era in which minorities were portrayed as less than equal to whites by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bit of a letdown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was thrilled to find this on Amazon.Com and ordered it as soon as possible. I had read about this movie a lot, and was interested to see how it might have been.The plot is interesting. Precinct 13 is moving to another location, and very few people are left there. Its last night, a man chases down a group of gangsters who shot his daughter, and he ends up at the station, about the same time a bus with a couple of fugitives shows up to borrow the holding cell. What continues from there is an all-out shootout as even more gangsters show up and start shooting anything that moves, trying to get the man--and anyone else--inside. The problem, for me, was the delivery. It really wasn't as tense a movie as I thought it would be, and it definitely didn't hold to its critically acclaim. The characters are alright, consisting mainly of a cop, a secretary, and two prisoners who opt to help out, while everyone else lay dead at the their feet. I would have thought a setup like that would have been good. But there were so many flaws. The cop, Austin Stoker, was alright, but the secretary, Laurie Zimmer, was just too ugly and too full of wit for me. Luckily, she didn't play the weak female role as I expected. But jeez, she gets shot in the arm, and all she does is stare blankly at her shooter. (!) Then there's the fugitives. The black one was alright, and I would have preferred he lasted longer than the other one, who was annoying me with his "Anyone got a smoke?" line to no end. The father, who was a dead ringer for James Woods, manages some good action in the beginning, but for the rest of the movie, he sits huddled silently in a corner!! I understand shock...but that bad? Also, there was the other secretary whose name I forgot, played by Nancy Loomis, and thank God her role was short, cuz she was way too annoying. As for all the other characters, so many people were shot, I forgot to care about them.I don't even know what else I don't like about this movie, just that I don't like it. Oh yeah, the music is horrible and repetitive. I figured that the man who brought us "Halloween" and its perfect soundtrack would have done better than this!! I've heard better from dust-collectors in the horror section at the video store. And just to note, the on-screen death of the little girl was a bit extreme for me. The spray of blood made it even worse. I think we could have been spared.Overall, I would say, see this to see what you think. I know a lot of people like this, and I can understand why, but it just didn't do it for me. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a stunning film. It still contains probably the most shocking scene I know in modern cinema - where the little girl is gratuitously shot - and the most perfectly balletic - where the besieged are shooting the attackers as they come through the windows.Sadly, after this John Carpenter was given money, and went downhill into creating clunkingly obvious 'horror' movies.The great thing about this movie - like Dark Star - is that it is a set of cliches brought to near perfection, it's the noble -prisoner who is really a good guy, it's the brave-but-doomed 'other good guy' whom you know is going to die, but for a moment you think has got away with it, the not-quite-brave enough girl who gets killed. But Carpenter handles cliches like Tarrantino (well better maybe) and surprises you that you were surprised to be surprised!I think this is one of the dozen best films ever made, but then I also think that Dark Star is too. Stuff boring Orson Welles, this is the real stuff.Someone please bankrupt John Carpenter and give him $10,000 and we'll see something really special!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little-Known Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of John Carpenter's best films, and the average moviegoer has probably never heard of it. "Assault" has a simple, solid premise (inspired by "Rio Bravo")that effectively builds tension and suspense. There's plenty of action, and the film is pulled off fairly realistically.The film was made on a shoestring in 1976, so it's definitely dated in some respects (acting, sound effects, special effects) but in others it's ahead of it's time. Carpenter has always been adept at making a film look like it had five times it's actual budget. The editing in some sequences is very exciting and plays well today, and some brutally violent scenes are still shocking.This would be a great film to re-make today. Bruce Willis and Sam Jackson would be great as the leads, and a top action director like John McTiernan or Paul Verhoeven would make it a knockout. Even JC himself could pull-off a re-make if he could put his his ego aside and focus on making an entertaining action/suspense film - a feat that has escaped him in the past decade.If you're into cult films, this is one to see. Look past its technical faults and you'll find an entertaining and exciting film that still holds up today. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of John Carpenter's earliest and most underrated films. Doesn't have the deepest plot, but it's a real entertaining and thrilling movie. Watching it, I noticed that this movie was sort of like "Night of the Living Dead" remade as an action film. There are many similarities between this movie and Night: An unlikely group of people trapped in a building with a bunch of people outside trying to get them, fighting the outside forces off with the limited amunition and resources they have, trying to escape, etc. Interestingly, this movie was made only two years before "Dawn of the Dead."John Carpenter's score is excellent and really helps set the mood of the film. Shows that Carpenter is just as talented a composer as he is a director. It's impressive what they were able to accomplish with only a $100,000 budget. Shows you really don't need a outrageously large budget to make a good movie (note to Hollywood!).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Directed by one of my heroes, the great John Carpenter, this film uses subtle tension and superb atmosphere to create a breathtaking edge-of-your-seat thriller. Carpenter is a master of the malevolent atmoshpere and proves it here. The story is about a couple of police officers and convicts who are seiged in a nearly empty police station by a gang of youngsters, who are after a man inside who has killed one of their leaders after that leader killed his daughter for no appearent reason (in one of the most upsetting murder scenes on movie history).This is one of John Carpenter's best films, even though "Escape From New York" is better, and it's an unusually "quiet" film, being an action/thriller. Just observe the scene in which the gang fires into the police station using silencers. Carpenter never lets the pace go down and keeps things going in his typical low-key fashion. The acting is okay, nothing special, except for two excellent performances by Tony Burton as Welles and especially by Darwin Joston as Napoleon Wilson. Great soundtrack by Carpenter, too. Outstanding film, well worhty of it's cult-film status. If you consider yourself a movie buff and you haven't seen it you should instead call yourself a hypocrate, that is, until you've seen it.A note of warning, though. You HAVE to watch the film in widescreen or else several shots are ruined as half of peoples faces end up outside the screen.</fullReview>

Bishop, played by Austin Stoker, is told to go to the police station at Anderson, which is about to be closed and relocated. A bus carrying prisoners (including Napoleon Wilson, played by Darwin Joston) must stop by when one of the prisoners gets sick. While travelling with her father, a girl is shot by a gangster, and the father responds by shooting him back. Other gang members follow him as he runs into the almost deserted police station. The gang members conduct a siege on the police station to the death and Bishop, Wilson, and others must fight for their lives.Assault on Precinct 13, despite its low budget, manages to be an exciting and suspenseful film. The acting is quite lousy (people don't respond when they get shot) which is a downside but its rarely boring and usually exciting. John Carpenter's music score is also very good and captures the atmosphere and mood of the film well. Some scenes are quite unrealistic and some are quite cheap-looking, but what else can you expect from a film made for this kind of budget.Australian Classification: R 18+Rating: 72 out of 100</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Carpenter, king of the mood piece, made this beauty for a scant hundred grand. The movie's plot revolves around a gang vowing the "Cholo', a death mark, on an old precinct nearly shut down and devoid of activity. John Carpenter once again proves his brilliant ability to turn the screws as he paces this film so deliberately that you begin to wonder when and if something is going to happen. And just when he knows the audience is thinking that, he shatters the silence (with a silencer, no less). This movie was shocking in its day, and certain scenes still hold up to be disturbing if dwelled upon. But the true prize in this film is the cinematography and staging. In one particular shoot-out in the precinct, Carpenter shows the claustrophobia everyone feels and the rapidly diminishing safety of the people inside with a rapid-fire edit scene that leaves you holding your breath. Anyone who is a fan of Tarantino or blaxploitation films will enjoy Carpenter's nod to the hard-boiled genre, and will appreciate his willingness to venture outside of that same realm and gift the audience with a truly remarkable and underrated film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have never been a big fan of John Carpenter's films except for this one, Dark Star, and Halloween, which were his first three films. The first time I saw this film was on HBO around midnight back in the 1980's and it was a white knuckles ride, but the first 20-30 minutes started off slow introducing the characters, none of which seem to interesting, but is obvious because of amaterurish actors. One of the main ladies in the film never raises her voice, barely moves her lips, and barely reacts when she's shot in the arm. This film has been known for it's lack of stars, but most have been in other films. Take a look at the index for the actors on this site. I had just found out that the man who played the Napoleon Wilson character had a small role in Eraserhead as a pencil factory attendant, the one who kept ringing the buzzer when the boy entered the shop. The film concerns a huge interracial gang who go around killing for fun. When a little girl and her father are going to pick up a relative, she is gunned down by the gang while her father is using the payphone. He is traumatized by this, shoots one of the men, flees to a nearly closed police station, and all hell breaks loose. The gang members shut down the power and phone lines and begin to siege the station no matter if it costs their lives and the remaining staff have few resources to make it. Only a few survive. I rate this film an 8 out of 10. The only weaknesses were the acting and production values, but action sequences and atmosphere are all top notch.</fullReview>

So say just about every film critic.Me, I thought I was watching a remake of "Night of the Living Dead". The single, synthesized song (bars is more to the point) sets the same doomed, eerie tone. Instead of zombies methodically attacking an isolated farm house, we have Latino gang bangers methodically attacking an isolated police station. The action is the same: the good guys are stuck. No way out. The assault is relentless. Whenever someone tries to make a break they're cut down. The zombies (punks) who get in, (and there are many), are mercilessly cut down. Carnage, doom, and desperation. Have a nice day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of Carpenter's better showings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 90's Carpenter has churned out a lot of very dubious movies (Escape from LA being the most embarrassing), but in the 70's he came up with some real crackers, one of which was this very under-rated action movie.This movie ain't about plot or acting, its all about suspense and building up tension, something that Carpenter used to be extremely good at (Escape from NY, Halloween...). The one thing that distinguishes Carpenter's movies from other similar wanabees is his own unique music scores. They are the key to making a movie suspenseful. Although very simple, they have similar rhythms that lend themselves very well to these type of movies.Young film-makers should seek out this very low budget action movie as an example of how to produce a truly suspenseful film.7/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Once again showing his reverence and respect for older films, Carpenter plays tribute to the classic western Rio Bravo(with a little Night of the Living Dead Thrown in) in telling the story of a small group of cops and convicts fending off a nocturnal assault of vicious LA gang members from a abandoned precinct.It is tight, well acted and a must see for all Carpenter fans. The laser disc and DVD have an excellent commentary by Carpenter. Undoubtably worth a rent or a purchase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a great fan of John Carpenter films. From Dark Star to Prince of Darkness i have bought or seen just about all of his pictures but missed this one and only recently saw it on video. I have to say that it was a bit of a disappointment. The violence is extreme. One scene involving the brutal killing of a young girl gave me a real shock and i could hardly believe id seen it. Sure in other Carpenter films the gore levels been higher but never have they been this brutal and sadistic. I get the feeling from this film that because the budget was low Carpenter went for real shock tactics to bring in the audiences. Its far from terrible but its not in the same league as his best work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I believe that Assault on precinct 13 is one of those films that you could watch over and over again. The acting is something to be desired but the simple plot and good vs bad theme make this film what it is really worth, a work of art. Assault on Precinct 13 is about a police station that is being relocated so the previous one is not in use. If you didn't think that John Carpenter was a brilliant director before seeing this film, then you have something to learn. I loved the way that from the very start of the picture you are entered into some dark organization, and the musical score helps project this effect. I also liked the way that the whole good vs bad element was there. Where the good guys had to keep the bad guys out of the police station when they are out numbered, out gunned, with no elecricity, and no way to reach the outside world.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie must be one of the best movies Carpenter directed, with "Halloween" and "In the mouth of madness". With a small budget, he did a remarkable remake of "Rio Bravo". He's the only american director able to direct remakes, he's got a personality so huge that he can give a personal touch to a movie he did not invent. Carpenter is one of today's masters, this movie proves it, we stay on the edge during all the movie, there is suspense, we don't know who will stay alive at the end of the movie, who will take a lost bullet and he gives a certain kind of mystery to the characters : who is the man whose daughter was shot, why is Napoleon Wilson called like that, why does the gang attack the precinct. There are several questions for which we're expecting an answer, that's why we can't leave our seat, it's physical, usually, the brains makes you leave your seat, there, your body fixes you on it, and when I feel something like that when I'm watching a movie, it means that it is a very very good movie, the greatest action movie I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film used an old police station building in Venice Beach California as the main location. It was in real life Los Angeles Police station Division 14. It takes place as the station is being vacated for a newer station, and people are there moving things out. Yes, these are gun and badge packin' folks, but they arefaced by a real danger. A gang who takes no prisoners, they want one thing, to kill the folks inside the station. And, they are determined.At times I was truly on the edge of my seat, and at other times, I wondered why they didn't take a different plan of action.

		<fullReview>Proof that $100,000 movies are killer-app classics do exist. Despite its cheap production values, this has been a superbly made action classic worth the wasted time well spent. John Carpenter took the western RIO BRAVO and made a dark and gritty urban setting out of it to accompany the suspense and violence. As a big plus, the movie's theme music deserves some recognition. No other gang war movie matches this kind of intelligent, well-defined experience. You might complain of this one as "too old" or "too dark", but how many newer movies of the genre can match its greatness? Probably none. Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must admit upfront that I am a particular fan of John Carpenter's work. I enjoyed the zany humor of his sci-fi spoof, "Dark Star", the inventiveness of his classic "Halloween", and Snake Plisskeen must be one of the most tenaciously suave characters I have ever seen. He is primarily a horror filmmaker (he writes, directs, edits, and composes the eerie scores), but this film is indicative of his other talents. The basic premise of this movie, probably so emulated by now that it's cliched, is a group of people trapped in an inactive police station surrounded by kamikazee gang members. Earlier in the movie, some police with shotguns decimate a group of suspicious punks without cause. This signals an irrevocable uproar in the gang community, where the members will stop at nothing to kill everyone. After they kill an innocent ice cream man and insensitively gun down a young girl, the distraught father chases them down. They stop near the police station, where the father shoots the assassan, and subsequently, finds himself outnumbered by other punks. He seeks refuge in the close station, and the siege commences. This film is apparently one of Quentin Tarantino's favorites, and you can see by the relentless carnage, and bloody warfare how this is true. The vindictive violence throughout vilifies our society. However, this film is confidently assured and every shot leaves an impression: the parking lot , the punks rolling under the trees, the car POV shots. As well, the tension is strong and supported by the "tough and no-holds barred" soundtrack, this film is really quite riveting. For his second film, this was superb work done by Carpenter. It seems ostensible, perhaps, that Carpenter's best work was in the seventies. I was truly astonished by what Carpenter did with his minuscule $100,000 budget; the film's quality is strikingly contemporary. Despite poor acting (some people actually don't move and stare blankly when they're shot), this film must be seen to be believed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>They Came In Through The Bathroom Window.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I knew this was going to be a winner in the first few minutes. A deserted, smoggy, street of vacant lots and scattered dwellings in residential Los Angeles. You know, when the smog lifts in Los Angeles, U.C.L.A.? A blue ice cream truck parked at the curb, it's ding-a-ling ringing. A car cruises by and the cute little eleven-year-old blond girl in pigtails pleads with the driver: "Daddy, Oh, Daddy, can't I have some ice cream -- please!!" He's a compliant daddy. The little girl stands at the open door of the ice cream truck and asks for a "vanilla twist." The guy seated behind the wheel pulls out a huge revolver with a silencer and shoots her -- BLAM -- through the chest, causing a rather large splotch of blood on her cute frock. Like so many of the rest of us, she got her ice cream but found she didn't enjoy it as much as she'd hoped.Directed by John Carpenter, this resonant tale has a warehouse full of modern weapons being stolen by the usual neighborhood gangs. All these gangs are integrated -- one ugly white guy, one black guy, one Hispanic with a beard and beret like Che's, and -- wait a minute. That's only three. There were four guys in this particular scouting party. Maybe the fourth guy was simply generic, left in there so that no demographic would feel neglected.At any rate, the situation proper develops. A handful of cops, two secretaries, and two prisoners are trapped by a faceless horde of unforgiving miscreants with silenced weapons. Best scene in the whole movie: The dozens of hoodlums fire through the windows and we can hardly hear any gun fire, just the tinkling and clinking of glass windows being shattered and their shards spilling across the floor. One of the secretaries has unusually prominent breasts. I thought I'd better get that in before I forgot.She may have been the producer's daughter or mistress because she can't act, but the deficit doesn't stand out because nobody else can act either, with one exception -- Tony Burton as Wells, one of the prisoners, who seems to have been before a camera earlier in his career.The ending may surprise you. The movie won't. It's a genre movie -- a "lost patrol" movie, out of John Ford's "The Lost Patrol" of 1934. In this genre, a diverse group of people of mixed motives, makes an heroic stand against an anonymous enemy.Don't miss it if you can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why was this movie called "Assault on Precinct 13"? In the first 5 minutes, when the lieutenant gets a radio call that sends him to the police station where the assault takes place, they clearly say "Precinct 9, division 13". So the entire movie takes place in Precinct 9.Why would the gang members stalk an ice cream truck, kill the driver and a little girl, and then leave? I thought they wanted the truck to carry out their assault.I also thought that they were going to break out the captive Wilson. Apparently they had no reason whatsoever to attack the station, except that this movie could not be made otherwise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With the arrival of the remake, I had to watch the "original" first. So I did and this is what I think of it:Lousy lousy acting. Seems all characters are incapable of showing emotions throughout the film, especially the girl. She gets shot, she kills, see her friend dead and not one tear? Come on!Story-wise, it was quite good actually. The pace was alright and we got enough of action to be satisfied. The soundtrack was horrible; well, for someone listening it now. Maybe then it was cutting edge, I don't know.Sadest part was the acting. When the gang starts to shoot &amp; enter the station, they all seemed like zombies! They enter 10, 20, 30 guys, all dying one after another. Oh well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good early Carpenter flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of people (a cop, 2 criminals and 2 women) are trapped in an abandoned, isolated police station. Outside is a gang that is set on killing all of them.One of Carpenter's first films. It's not really a horror movie--it's more of a thriller and a Western (it's a direct homage to "Rio Bravo"). It's not a great movie--the acting is bad and the dialogue is just horrendous. Also the opening 45 minutes are slow and clumsy. But when the attack begins the movie really kicks.The attacks are long, violent, exciting and more than a little scary. The gang members are never identified, never speak and are almost never shown--they're always in shadow or darkness. This makes them all the more frightening. Also he used the idea of the faceless, never seen killer in his next film--a little film called "Halloween". The film is worth seeing just to see Carpenter's direction. Even back then he used the full frame of the movie screen very well (this has to be seen letter boxed) and he composed a very eerie score that fits the film perfectly. Look for a very young Kim Richards who plays a crucial role in the film.Worth seeing--but no great shakes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Crude and irresponsible</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most filmmakers with "legendary" careers have contributed at least one worthwhile film to society. John Carpenter has somehow achieved this status without doing so. This so called "masterpiece" is hailed by many as Carpenter's best work, but really, it's just a crude and irresponsible film that rips off other films without adding anything of any depth.This film is 49% Rio Bravo, 49% Night of the Living Dead, and 2% original. What little originality Carpenter displays is a script with the intellegence of a 12 year old boy. The characters are cardboard cutouts, despite the best attempts by a couple of the actors, and the dialogue is incredibly simple and shallow. Austin Stoker, as Lt. Bishop, and Darwin Joston, as Wilson, try their best to give heart to their lifeless characters. The setup of the various characters and how they become involved in the impending shootout is incredibly contrived and the "force" that draws them to precinct nine is weak. Carpenter's original idea is, why not combine elements of an unrealistic horror film and a film that takes place a hundred years ago, and make a realistic presentation in the middle of a metropolis in the present day. Night of the Living Dead and Rio Bravo work because of their isolated settings and lack of the presence of "law". Carpenter goes to great lengths to show how these events could happen in the middle of Los Angeles, but he fails because it is PREPOSTEROUS. I've lived in Los Angeles, and there is no such area in the middle of the city that's so abandonned and isolated. Or any large city, for that matter. The ridiculous behavior, appearance, and all around manner of the gang members really make this film dated. Not to mention the cheesy funk music that always accompanies them. When the gang members try to penetrate the precinct, their entrance and subsequent death is reminiscent of the old NES game Duck Hunt. Stevie Wonder could knock these guys off. Violence done in this manner is not only silly, but irresponsible. As is trying to turn convicted death row convicts into heroes. That should need no explanation.Assault is crude, silly, and probably written by a pre-pubescent Carpenter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Car 54 Where Are You?? Rescue me from this movie!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts out okay, and builds up a good atmosphere with rather foreboding and somewhat creepy events, but when it comes to delivering the actual payload, it seems kind of like the movie equivalent of a scud missile - yeah, it blows up and makes lots of boom and smoke and all, but it doesn't accurately hit any vital target. I couldn't help noting that the acting in this movie is a real mixed bag. Some of the acting is fairly good, but there is an uncomfortable amount of bad acting (I mean, no better than in a junior high school acting class) that overshadows the good. As someone commented, many of the characters aren't given much of a chance to act, for they are simply blown away too early in the movie. And as someone else below commented, the one secretary (Leigh, played by Laurie Zimmer), who gets nicked in the arm with a hot round, seems to be ludicrously zombie-like. She is so mechanical in her delivery I almost thought she was a motorized mannequin (with big hair).There are also some glaring lapses in credibility, like, for example: the goons outside the station blast away at the precinct house for what must have been 5 minutes, firing literally hundreds of rounds of ammo into the building from all directions. Then, just a few minutes later, Lt. Bishop is shown sticking his head right up to the windows, so as to peer out and see who has been doing all this shooting. That would have been a stupid thing to do in real life, and it seemed a stupid thing to do in this movie. How come they didn't just open fire on him standing there at the window, when they were obviously intent on killing everyone in the precinct?The synthesizer music is cool, and is nicely woven into the story, but it *is* repetitive, I could have used a little more variety with the background music. I also like the sound effects created by having a mass armed assault - but with the whole assault being carried out with silenced weapons. All you hear are numerous spats, plinks, baps, tinks, etc. No booms or bangs like you'd expect in most other gun battle scenes. I don't think I've ever seen that in a movie before, it was pretty cool.A funny scene: we see them trying to use an antiquated-looking Motorola 2-way radio set to attempt to call another precinct nearby for help. But one of the hoodlums has cut the connection so they can't use it. If they could have just held out a few more years, they all would have been packing Motorola cell phones. Problem solved! (Also, I like the shameless product promotion scene: the people trapped in the precinct need to barricade a door from the incoming goons, so they slide a big old Coca Cola soft drink dispenser across the floor and block the door with it. Gee I wonder how many people, upon seeing this, left their seats to go out and get a Coke?)Anyway, I don't want to diss it entirely, it is an interesting movie, (really more of a curiosity) but I regret that I can't give it the glowing endorsement that many others have. Yes, I respect the fact that the budget was tight, but there are many other equally low-budget films that can easily boast of much better acting and tighter plot. To me this flick comes across more like a 60's drive-in horror movie than a compelling crime story. And as far as police stories go, I think I got more cop-story entertainment from watching the average Barney Miller episode than I got from watching this at-times dopey "hoodlums-on-the-rampage" crime movie. Well, shift change is coming up. I'm on my way out for coffee and doughnuts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Carpenter's masterpiece can be enjoyed on at least three different levels. As a brilliant horror-thriller, for me nearly as horribly tense as 'The Blair Witch Project'. As a spot-the-reference movie-buff game, with Carpenter alluding to everyone from Hawks and Hitchcock to Melville and Peckinpah. Too much of the second might spoil the first - this seems to be Carpenter's intention, his house of cinematic cards shown to be crucially impotent, sexuality being the key to the film. The third is as a potent urban nightmare - the film is full of action and fright, but the best scenes are those which suspend sensation - the eerie, empty streets; the whole sequence leading up to the horribly funny vanilla twist murder.</fullReview>

When quickly browsing the comments on it, I was promised suspense and hard-boiled action in a classic Carpenter movie.What I got out of the movie however was no suspense whatsoever, a pointless story, an incredible scenario, flat characters, a predictable script, and poor editing and effects. And this got 7.3? I want my one and a half hours back.In its defense (I guess), it IS a low budget movie and it sure is old. I'm sure I'll be flamed by writing this by all Crapenter fanatics out there.All in all, this movie HARDLY deserves more than a 3 or a 4 maybe, but that's stretching it in my opinion (which I'm entitled to).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Before Halloween, there was a Great Thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before making the original Halloween into one of the most profitable independent films of all time, John Carpenter directed this riveting low-budget thriller from 1976, in which a nearly abandoned police station is held under siege by a heavily armed gang called Street Thunder. Inside the station, cut off from contact and isolated, cops and convicts who were headed for death row must now join forces or die. That's the basic plot, but it's what Carpenter does with it that's remarkable. Drawing specific inspiration from the classic Howard Hawks Western Rio Bravo (which included a similar siege on disadvantaged heroes), Carpenter used his simple setting for a tense, tightly constructed series of action sequences, emphasizing low-key character development and escalating tension. Few who've seen the film can forget the "ice cream cone" scene in which a young girl is caught up in the action by patronizing a seemingly harmless ice cream truck. It's here, and in other equally memorable scenes, that Carpenter demonstrates his singular knack for injecting terror into the mundane details of daily life, propelling this potent thriller to cult favorite status and long-standing critical acclaim.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blood, gore and fears as good guys are under siege in a cop shop.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being one of Carpenter's earlier efforts, I researched his portfolio and discovered that, of his movies I've seen, only one was earlier: Dark Star (1974). This one, 13, is a better production, but still falls short.Don't get me wrong: I like Carpenter's work, but there's no doubt that his first "best" movie is Halloween (1978), just two years after this one. I guess that's the time when he'd gotten all of his ability together with a cast and production team that matched his skill as director.That said, 13 is still a taut little thriller, even though one has to monumentally suspend disbelief in order to go along for the ride. For those who don't know the story, this is it, in a nutshell: a gang of bad dudes attack a police station that's in the process of being closed down; a few cops, three hard-core criminals in transit and two female office workers fend them off. Why all the ruckus? A citizen sought safety in the cop shop after killing one of the gang members and now they want to kill him. Why did he kill the gang member? One of the gang killed his daughter as casually as you or I'd kill a bug. Why did the bad dude do that? Because that's what really bad dudes do...So, as stories go, it's okay, I guess. It's just that, by today's standards, it's very dated. For starters, the dialog is just too nice, especially when the hard-core criminals talk. Even in 1976, they all used "bad" words; these guys talk pitter-patter in comparison. Oh, I know, back then, the studios, distributors and cinemas were wary of films using bad language and had to continually pretend that the fictional world was different. Having said that, there are still some memorable lines that are worth waiting for, beginning with Wilson's constant need to ask: "Got a smoke?" However, the acting was, to put it nicely, just adequate to get the job done. There was so much shooting going on that tended to mask the somewhat stilted mannerisms and movements of most of the actors. Showing emotion tended also to be way overdone, or ? in the case of the bad guys ? a dreadful parody of the deadly deadpan dude. The only acting that came close to interesting was the chemistry between the killer, Napoleon Wilson (the late Darwin Joston) and Leigh (Laurie Zimmer) with the former doing his best to imitate Bogie and Zimmer as a sexy, smoldering Bacall.Cinematography and sound, with Carpenter's thumping score, showed how much he had developed since Dark Star. Together with the special effects, the viewer is treated to credible action sequences that ring true to the fictional situation. Unhappily for me, the suspense is lost with too many talky spots during what was supposed to be a siege. It reminded me of a scene in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966), when Tuco (Eli Wallach), in a bath tub, is about to be killed by a garrulous bandit; as Tuco, instead, kills the bandit, he says: "If you're gonna talk, talk ? if you're gonna shoot, shoot!"Despite its faults, for Carpenter fans (and I count myself in that bunch) this is required viewing. My only reservation now is whether I should see the remake from 2005. Maybe I will...maybe I won't...maybe I will...ah, what the hey.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Forget any other typical "action siege" movies in your mind now. Forget the clumsy remake of this film, a disaster. And forget the modern sort of "teen horror" movies that are supposedly shockingly scary and tense. Love action films? This is for you. Love dramas? This is for you. Love horror? This is for you. Love great films altogether? Yep, this is for you.But that fine recommendation doesn't come without warning. Yes, technically this is an ideal Friday/Saturday night movie to watch with a bowl of popcorn. But prepare to lose it all by throwing it up in the air in the more extreme moments of shock, shocking violence and terror. And be warned: they come quite often."So what's going on? Why is this such a great, but dark film? And is it action? They're not normally scary." Forget that notion.So the film: Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) for reasons too inane to really mention (basically, he gets sent to a closed precinct to watch it shut down) gets unintentionally involved in a gang war started by sadistic, brutal thugs. How come?- because the father of a young white girl who gets murdered seeks revenge upon the gang, giving chase and manages to kill just one. He then runs for his life into the closed precinct 13 (where our protagonist is) and while he is talking mumbled gibberish in a state of fear, a ruthless attack from the gang begins upon the police station. Sound scary? You've no idea.Due to illness, however, a bus full of criminals has to stop at the Precinct to get help before the contagious cough of one of the passengers spreads and infects. Ironically, the only form of help to Ethan, a secretary lady and her annoying friend comes in the hands of two widely hated criminals- Napoleon Wilson (Darwin Joston) and his black inmate- giving a nervous dark bit of humour to this otherwise awful tale.From there, the tension really picks up. One reason why this films succeeds so much is it does a lot with so little. (I believe) it is low budget, and much of the film (certainly the second half) takes place in near complete darkness- adding to the always present feeling that no matter how hopeful things are going, something awful is always lurking along the way. One of the reasons why this film earned its "supposed" '18' rating in the UK is surely because of what relies on the imagination of the viewer, rather than any other visual elements.And the acting- superb. All of the characters seem to act effortlessly, with real genuine fear, really bringing out the best in the awesome script. Assault on Precinct 13 (due to the cold subject matter of murder, sadism and terror) shouldn't be- but it is what it is- a treat.**** out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie solely on the reviews and recommendations of Netflix and IMDB, as I had not heard of it before and am a big John Carpenter fan. What a mistake that was. Unbelievable plot, horrific acting, ludicrous dialogue, nitpicks too numerous to mention, and a soundtrack that sounded like it was lifted off a bad 70's porn flick. The stereotypical characters - the hysterical female who you know is going to get a bullet, the convict-with-a-heart-of-gold; will he ever get a cigarette? I especially liked the stoic underacting secretary who is wearing a sweater so flesh-colored that most of the time it looked like she was nude. I only wish the folks at Mystery Science Theater had gotten ahold of this one. I fully understand that this is one of Carpenter's early works, but a "cult classic"? I don't think so.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Influential but badly dated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film has many antecedents, such as Rio Bravo and Night of the living dead, it is one of the first to bring the idea of the unstoppable force of evil mainstream and thus pave the way (for good or ill) for Carpenter's later works and the host of imitations this has created. The atmospheric use of synthesizers in the soundtrack is remarkably prescient for 1976 and again the influence was perhaps not for the best.The plot itself, although contrived, is effective. The build-up scenes are well done with a great deal of tension. There is some sharp dialogue and the rather wooden acting at points does not detract from this or indeed the low budget nature of the film.Unfortunately, the action sequences disappoint. This starts with a strange scene where a car containing a murderous gang is pursued by a vengeful father whose daughter has been killed by them. One of the gang steps out of the car into the open and basically lets himself by shot. Although out of bullets and helpless, the gang do not shoot at him, but let him escape only to then follow him to the station.This is not the last we see of the gang's suicidal tendencies, since they act more like zombies (albeit armed) who like to run into bullets. Nor is this the only problem. The whole sequences look very cheap and are rather crudely edited.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Carpenter Action Thriller Classic!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer, Tony Burton and Charles Cyphers star in John Carpenter's 1976 action thriller. This film begins with a shootout between cops and a gang of thugs. We meet rookie cop, Ethan Bishop (Stoker), who is about to get one hell of a first assignment when he reports to precinct 13 in the town of Anderson that's in the process of moving. We're also introduced to convict, Napolean Wilson (Joston) who is about to be transported to death row, but stops at precinct 13 because of an ill prisoner. Soon, a vicious gang decides to test the weapons they stole with the leader killing an ice cream man and a little girl whose father gets revenge on him. When he seeks help at precinct 13, it becomes a battle ground between additional gang members and the people trapped inside. Zimmer plays Leigh, a woman who works at the precinct, Cyphers (Halloween) plays prisoner transporter, Starker and Burton (Rocky) plays unfortunate convict, Wells. This Carpenter classic has a great cast and good score by Carpenter himself that I recommend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Assault on Precinct 13" is one of those movies that doesn't pretend to be any kind of masterpiece. Still, it ends up being a thriller, due to the claustrophobia factor. Much like "Strawdogs", "Deliverance" and "Taxi Driver", it shows seemingly ordinary people having to bring out their inner beast.An LA police station is shutting down while a gang is running wild. Then, a bus full of convicts has to stop at the station after one of the convicts starts feeling ill. Meanwhile, the gang is chasing a man. The man takes refuge in the station, and then the battle begins. The gang traps the man, the convicts, and some cops in the station. Lt. Ethan Bishop (Austin Stoker) becomes de facto leader in the station. Naturally, a lot of people on both sides get killed, but we expect that in a siege-related flick.If "Assault on Precinct 13" isn't very good, it wasn't intended to be, and it doesn't pretend to be anything other than what it is: nice, enjoyable brain candy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This film could be remade -- again....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 is essentially a remake of NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD (and also RIO BRAVO and I'm sure some other less memorable films too). Only here we have gang members while in NOTLD there are zombies. Here the gang members try to invade a police precinct in a Los Angeles ghetto, while in the other film the zombies try to invade a rural farmhouse. Unfortunately, the zombies in that film are far more believable than the street thugs in this film -- and so is everything else.Personally, I think this film is an insult to street gangs. In real life, they are not this stupid, evil or violent and they sure as hell have a lot more personality in real life than they do here (so do the zombies in NOTLD). If I were in a street gang, I would be complaining to someone (perhaps the Anti-Defamation League) that this film unfairly smears street gangs as being racially integrated Goldilocks killers. And the gang members here look more like a pastiche of the Symbionese Liberation Army, the Black Panthers and Che Guevara look-alikes than the Crips or the Bloods. They look like they should be quoting Trotsky and Mao and singing and dancing to the music of "Hair" and "Pippen" as they attack the precinct (perhaps I am being unfair toward the "thug" fashion of a different era, but I don't remember street gangs looking much like the guys in the 1970s except in low-budget movies; maybe I should do a Google image search).But the real problem with this film is that it is not exciting. It's just poorly directed, perhaps because of what must have been a minuscule budget. The action is slow and predictable, the direction is poor and over-staged, and the story is laughably contrived (interesting how there is a power-outage just as the gang members attack). Some of the characters could have been interesting, but ... they aren't. They just have forced, annoying one-liners. No characterization -- just actors speaking lines. Some of the actors are pretty good, while others are really bad. Also, the muscial score (if one could call it that) is terrible. It sounds like 12 year old kid doodling on a synthesizer. John Carpenter went on to direct some very good genre-thrillers later on (especially, of course, HALLOWEEN and THE THING), so I'm guessing he was still learning his craft here.NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD is far more interesting than this film because it has a strong sense of irony, has stronger characterization, it has a striking and very creepy visual style to it, and it is better paced. And because it deals with the supernatural undead (instead of a street gang that resembles the undead) it therefore leaves more to the imagination of the viewer in terms of emotion, psychology, politics, metaphor, etc. In short, NOTLD is genuinely cinematic, whereas ASSAULT is just a throwaway drive-in film with bad special effects and boring stock characters. NOTLD will stay with you because the images are so iconic (or iconoclastic) and unusual and you'll wonder what it might mean. This film stays with you just because it is a weird combination of laughably gratuitous violence (the 70s was THE decade for this), pessimism, nihilism and crap film-making.There are some good things about this film, mainly the strong concept, some decent acting, and one particular scene that features two death row convicts playing "potatoes." Apart from that, this film is most missable. If you are a fan of 1970s cult films, you can do much, much better than this one. If you are a fan of bad 1970s cult films, then this one is for you. I haven't seen the remake of a year or two ago, but it doesn't sound promising. Too bad Abel Ferrara isn't doing much these days. He would have been perfect to remake this film in to a better one. Robert Rodriguez could do a lot with the same concept too, though he already made the decidedly similar FROM DUSK TILL DAWN -- a much better and much more fun film. Perhaps Quentin Tarantino, Takashi Miike, John Woo, Luc Besson or even Steven Soderbergh could do a good film using the same concept.</fullReview>

The characters are a different mixture of sorts, but I'm not sure that they played that well off of each other.The gang members weren't believable. They were even comical in some scenes. A lot of the film was lackluster in its delivery - whether it be the dry action scenes or the barren dialog emitted from even dryer lips.The soundtrack is the best thing about Assault on Precinct 13. It'll keep you interested enough to allow you to make it until the end. I was almost relieved when I finally saw the credits.If by some chance someone reading this hasn't seen it, don't listen to the hype and try and force yourself to like a film that's not all that good to begin with.</fullReview>

But why did the gang kill the ice cream truck driver and the girl? They didn't want the ice cream nor the money. No point at all.The whole rest is useless there's no meaning at all.Thats a big B movie it couldn't be more B.And if you need a shocking movie get a real shocking movie not such a hopeless flick.Dialogues are rusty too.

I'm about to watch the 2005 version and can only hope that it is at least a little bit entertaining.If you're into B movies or are a pretentious critic with a love for "social commentary", you might like it.

		<fullReview>Yeah-yeah-yeah, I know this is supposed to be a "Rio Bravo" set in mid-1970's L.A. But all the same, WHAT A SNORE! If Carpenter paid tribute to the classic western this way he must've hated "Rio Bravo".The actors seem to be on the verge of narcolepsy, the plot is non-sensical, the female characters are either hysteric or try to look horny yet tough, but can't seem to make up their mind. No wonder we never heard of any of them afterwards, their performance could be enhanced by them studying grass growing."Assault on Precinct 13" actually reminds me of some sort of zombie movie from the 50's - the gang attacking the police station must've gone to the same actor's studio as the extras in "Plan 9 from Outer Space". There is absolutely no logic whatsoever to what they are doing and also a mystery to where they all came from or why they all would do such a stupid thing. They all seem to have the brains of laboratory mice, yet the logistics of a SWAT-team.I've got to hand it to Carpenter though that his syntheziser music is kind of cool and certainly sticks in your head.The reason I give it a two out of ten is that it is slightly better than a porno movie, with just a fraction more of plot and dialogue (although it shares some of a pornoflick's fascination for showing people riding around in cars). Maybe I'm a cynic after all and realize that I probably will see something even worse the next fifty years, which I will reserve the score "one" for.In the end the final verdict is: don't waste your time or money except to avoid it at all cost!2/10</fullReview>

They might as well be zombies for all the emotion they bring to their characters.This was a typical movies of the '70s: cheap, gratuitous profanity and stupid dialog, sleazy characters and just plain crude. It's also typical of the films from the '60s to day where "bad guys" (in this movie, death row inmates) are actually pictured as "good guys!"

		<fullReview>Possible Spoilers: When I first saw this movie many years ago on cable, I couldn't understand why it was made. a nameless gang commits random murders of adults and children (if you want to gear your audience for a really cheap mad-on, kill a kid), then attacks a police station harboring a guy who killed one of the gang members. That's the movie. This is a nameless, faceless gang that we never see, that attack like robot drones, all armed with guns with silencers, yet can't spring for bullet-proof vests. They get mowed down like grass but keep comin', proving how stupid they are. However, they seem smart enough to figure out how to cut all the phone lines in the neighborhood so no-one can call out when someone finally gets the bright idea of calling for help. The director conveniently forgets that police stations have radios that can call to other stations, and emergency generators to power those radios in case power is lost too. What's worse, he expects his audience to forget that too.Unfortunately, the audience does. This is a high-rated movie by a lot of critics and users, which makes a statement on the intelligence of American movie-goers I can't even touch. It's dumb, insulting to the intelligence, violent for it's own sake, and I wouldn't be surprised if it inspired some disturbed person to shoot at a police officer at some point. Of all John Carpenter's hack movies, this is the worst one. This movie was remade in 2005. Of all the movies to remake, they chose this one? It would seem that studios know their American audience......</fullReview>
