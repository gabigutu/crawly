		<fullReview>Though there may be a tendency to compare the 1980 version of "Little Miss Marker" to the 1934 version (with Shirley Temple as The Kid), writer/director Walter Bernstein captures the very essence of the 1930's with his screenplay and direction, respectively. One of the reasons I loved the 1980 version is the set designs and the vivid colors of the film. But even more importantly, I loved Walter Matthau's performance as Sorrowful Jones. He has great one-liners that only add to this gem of a film. Of course, nobody plays a sidekick better than Bob Newhart, who plays Regret. Newhart and Matthau made a great team in this movie, and I wish they had worked on more films together. I love The Kid (played by one-time film actress Sara Stimson), for she adds a cuteness to her character that is similar to Shirley Temple's "Kid", but yet is different in that her character displays quite a bit more innocence. Julie Andrews is more than believable as Amanda Worthington, as she tries to soften the two men in her life. And one should not forget Tony Curtis, who is perfect Blackie.I regret that this movie didn't make more money at the box office, because it did capture the lives of the poor majority and privileged minority during the Depression very well. And it is funny and just a fun movie to watch. Little Miss Marker is one of my favorite films (added to the already long list) because it looks great cinemagraphic-wise, the script is well done, and the performances are very, very good. I find it interesting that this version of the famous Damon Runyon story is the first to be released on DVD (2004). Don't miss this chance to buy it and own it. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Miss Marker is just so cute and romantic that i cant stand it! Sara Stimson is adorable. Julie Andrews shines, and you see her like you were staring straight at the sun from just inches away, that's how much she shines. Miss Andrews' character (Amanda Worthington) is so kind and generous,yet so loud and independant. Walter Matthau is good, but Julie Andrews surpasses him very quickly and she acts right from the heart. Praise goes right to Julie Andrews! Bravo!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Little Miss Marker got its fourth and final film version with Walter Matthau as the screen's biggest grump since Ned Sparks perfectly cast as Sorrowful Jones. Curiously enough the third remake entitled 40 Pounds Of Trouble had Tony Curtis as the hero. Here he's the villain.And even more curious Matthau and Curtis had worked together previously in Goodbye Charlie where Tony Curtis was top billed. Just the fickle fortune of the movie game.The story is set back in the Depression Era and Andrew Rubin leaves his daughter Sara Stimson in lieu as a marker with bookie Matthau. Later on he drowns himself in the river and Matthau is stuck with her. But she proves invaluable to winning rich widow Julie Andrews. And she softens the heart of the old sourpuss as we've seen in many a film.As for Curtis he's got a couple of deals with Matthau reluctantly going along. And when they go south Matthau has some decisions to make.Matthau does well indeed stepping in the shoes of a role played by Adolphe Menjou, Bob Hope, and Tony Curtis. One would not think of Julie Andrews and Walter Matthau as a screen time, but as it turns out she compliments him beautifully. Curtis was now making the transition from leading man to character actor and he's very good.Note also Brian Dennehy and Bob Newhart as aides to Curtis and Matthau. They act as seconds in a very silly duel on one of the New York piers. And Lee Grant is nicely cast as a judge in Family Court of the Depression at the end of the film.Sara Stimson of course is no Shirley Temple, but none of the other little girls who succeeded her from the first version are either. It's the main weakness of this and the other two succeeding films. Still this one is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was a nice 1970's movie even though it was made in 1980. The little girl who played The Kid,(Viola Kates Stimpson) appeared to be a seasoned actress even though this was her first and last movie role. Too bad, because she showed a great presence on the large screen. Walter Matthau playing the cantankerous unhappy bookie who falls for The Kid was believable and quite touching.Supporting characters Tony Curtis as the mobster killer with his muscle Brian Dennehy , as well as Bob Newhart playing Walter Matthau's right hand man, and rounding up the stellar cast, Julie Andrews, whose horse farm was slowly being taken over by the mobster Tony Curtis, were all great supporting actors.This is very light movie fare, and you won't need any facial tissues for any sad tug at your heart string scenes, but what you will get is a 70's style THE STING type movie that is enjoyable for the whole family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was actually present at CalExpo (home of the California State Fair) in the late summer of 1979 during the shooting of "Little Miss Marker". The horse racing scenes and much of the "ranch" scenes were filmed there at the time of a significant equestrian show, and my dad appears as an extra in at least one scene.I first saw the movie in early 2007, so it brought back many memories--"Smokey and the Bandit" was in general release at the time, Julie Andrews appeared in Blake Edwards' "10" the year before "Little Miss Marker", and in "S.O.B." the year after (wherein she briefly bares her breasts for the audience in a fit of exasperation) so LMM represents a clear break between the 70s and 80s for ME. The word "DIVORCE" comes to mind.Ironically, LMM is itself a VERY ENJOYABLE film. Just be aware that there are some underlying emotional themes that may unpredictably affect folks in their late 30s and early 40s.</fullReview>
