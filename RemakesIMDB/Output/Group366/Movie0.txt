		<fullReview>Ronald Colman shines in the dual role of the dissipated Crown Prince Rudolph and the "simple Englishman", Rudolph Rassendyl. The crown prince's predilection for the bottle recalls Colman's earlier portrayal of the dark side of Sydney Carton from A Tale of Two Cities. In contrast, Rassendyll's reluctant gallantry and abiding integrity and honor epitomize the qualities for which matinée idol Colman had become known during his famous film career. His scenes with the incandescent Madeleine Carroll are especially felicitous, both visually and aurally. The poignant, penultimate scene of the film left this reviewer with a wistful sense of regret that The Prisoner of Zenda was to be their only cinematic collaboration.Raymond Massey was never better as the ambitious Duke Michael. The expressionistic qualities of his facial contortions make his lines almost superfluous. The rakish Count Rupert, played by Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., represents the archetypal rogue. His perennial smile, abiding charm, and sardonic wit make him a curious composite of Don Juan and Mephistopheles. Like Massey, I have never seen the underrated son of the silent screen's most dashing hero in better form.The film's remaining actors acquit themselves more than adequately. Mary Astor is the lovely Antoinette, Duke Michael's devoted, yet unfairly, neglected paramour. Her consistently dark raiment and shadowy movements are perhaps reflective of her lover's illegitimate origins, while at the same time belying her kind heart. Visually this is contrasted with the always radiant Princess Flavia.The two royal bodyguards, Colonel Zapt and Captain von Tarlenheim, are a case study, to my mind, as to why films like The Prisoner of Zenda are consistently superior to today's mediocre fare. Although relatively lesser roles, they are capable of, and on more than one occasion, do dominate a given scene; moreover, in their own way they are as fully developed as any of the principals. The abiding sense of honor and loyalty expressed by C. Aubrey Smith's Colonel Zapt is so profoundly felt and reflective of a long-vanished ethos, that one laughs to think of any contemporary actor making such utterances. The paradox would be striking!As for Zapt's protégé, Captain von Tarlenheim, given the camera's fondness for the handsome young star, it will come as no surprise to learn that this role was reputedly David Niven's first acting breakthrough. His gift for dry English understatement is the occasion for one especially humorous scene-stealing moment that I will generously leave to the curious viewer to enjoy for himself. With such an outstanding, marquee cast that lives up to its advanced billing and then some, it is not difficult to understand why this film was such a rousing success when it premiered in 1937; so successful, in fact, that it was copied verbatim by MGM 15 years later after it purchased the rights from Selznick. With no slight intended to Stewart Granger et al., you cannot improve on perfection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic with class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If anyone wants to see an excellent movie made before the banner cinematic year of 1939, this would be a film to watch. It could hardly have gone wrong, with David O. Selznick as producer and John Cromwell as director. And a superlative cast of popular stalwarts, mostly from Hollywood's British colony. Ronald Colman is his usual smooth and accomplished self in a dual role, King Rupert (of some fictitious country) and look-alike Englishman Rudolph Rassendyll, very distant cousins. The scenes in which he faces himself onscreen ? called `trick photography' then ? are remarkable for the period. Lovely Madeleine Carroll plays a princess, betrothed to the king. Her equal in elegance and beauty wasn't seen on the screen again until Audrey Hepburn and Julie Andrews. Many critics have praised Douglas Fairbanks, jr, as a likeable rogue. He's very good, in an easy role. My applause goes to the two stars. The film is a glamorous combination of romance, spectacle and adventure. Don't even dream of realism; there was too much realism in ordinary life during most of the Thirties. This is a grand escape to a time and place that never were. If I had to pick a favorite scene in the film, it would be the famous entrance of Colman and Carroll into the coronation ball. The shot opens on the couple, walking fast, arm in arm, directly toward us. The camera pulls back and back and BACK until the grand staircase of the palace and the entire ballroom, filled with people, are revealed. Visually and technically, this single fluid shot is a stunning achievement. It shows us the creative work that could be done at the time, by hugely talented artists, long before the advent of zoom lenses and computer graphics. Elegance and class are not hallmarks of most current movies. `The Prisoner of Zenda' (1937) is a stylish and very satisfying example ? a symbol, perhaps ? of what escapist entertainment can be. And of what it could and should be, now and then, even today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Colman - Selznick triumph</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sir Anthony Hope Hawkins was a successful London barrister, who got his measure of permanent fame as the author of several novels. Some were quite popular in their day, like "The Dolly Dialogues" and "The Man In The Car" (which bases it's central figure on Cecil Rhodes). But it is his two "Ruritanian" Romances, "The Prisoner Of Zenda" and "Rupert Of Hentzau" that are the main novels he is recalled for, especially "The Prisoner Of Zenda". Set in a middle European kingdom, it was (for it's day in the last decades of the 19th Century) an updating of the swashbuckling novels of Alexandre Dumas. Dumas had some stories set in "modern Europe" ("The Count Of Monte Cristo" is set in the period of 1815 - 1830, and was written in 1844 - 1845), but most were in earlier periods, such as the 16th, 17th, and 18th Centuries. Hope Hawkins (who wrote under the name Anthony Hope) figured that there was sufficient intrigue and deviltry in modern Europe to transplant the plot style to the 1870s - 1890s.And there was considerable intrigue, especially in Eastern Europe. In the 1880s Prince Alexander of Battenberg seemed set to become first Prince or King of Bulgaria. He had won admiration in Europe for his stunning victories over the armies of the Kingdom of Serbia in a war of 1885 (the war that was the background to Shaw's ARMS AND THE MAN), and was poised to get his crown, when the Russian Empire balked. They thought Alexander was too pro-German, and too close (due to family relationships) to Great Britain. So Alexander was toppled, and forced to leave Bulgaria under very humiliating circumstances. Eventually Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg got the Bulgarian throne."The Prisoner Of Zenda" is not based on the story of Alexander of Battenberg, but it shows the type of conspiracy atmosphere that pervaded the area. Basically the plot is an old one of substitutions concerning political figures. Dumas had used one in "The Vicomte De Bragalone", a huge multi-volume novel that included "The Man In The Iron Mask". One of the theories about the Iron Mask (the one that Dumas used)was that it was the twin brother of King Louis XIV. In that novel D'Artagnan has to thwart a plot to replace the Sun King with his brother - a plot that almost succeeds. Hope changed this slightly. Here the King is threatened by his ambitious half-brother, and the King's distant twin cousin replaces him to save the throne.The 1937 film version of the novel is usually considered the best of several (including the 1951 version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr, and a comic version with Peter Sellers and Lionel Jeffries in 1978). David Selznick was the producer, this being part of his series of movies-based-on-famous-novels that included "A Tale Of Two Cities" (also with Colman), "David Copperfield" (with W.C.Fields), and finally "Gone With The Wind". His casting was top notch, with Colman supported by Madeleine Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, C. Aubrey Smith, and David Niven. It is an exciting and well made film, and definitely worth watching.Selznick hoped to do the sequel "Rupert Of Hentzau", but that book is a comparative downer. Several of the main characters from the first novel are killed, and one of them shows a less likable side to his personality than in the first story. He toyed with a total rewrite of the story, to try to make Fairbanks a hero instead of a villain. The project never reached fruition. Probably just as well. It is rare for a successful film production to be replicated in a sequel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lookalike Saves Kingdom in Classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Prisoner of Zenda' is one of the most fondly-remembered films of the '30s, and for good reason. It offers Ronald Colman, one of Hollywood's most beloved British stars, in the dual role of Rudolf, crown prince of a small European kingdom, and Rudolf Rassendyll, his look-alike British cousin, end product of a brief affair of an ancestor (as the Englishman puts it, "Fishing in forbidden waters"); the radiant Madeleine Carroll, best-known as Robert Donat's leading lady in Hitchcock's classic 'The 39 Steps', as the royal betrothed, who falls in love with the pretender; Raymond Massey, Canadian star of H.G. Wells' SF masterpiece, 'Things to Come' (and, 3 years later, the quintessential Abraham Lincoln on stage and in film!), as Black Michael, Rudolf's scheming half-brother; and, best of all, a youthful Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., son of silent Hollywood's greatest swashbuckler (and a pretty fair swashbuckler, himself), as the suavely villainous ally of Michael.The story is simple, and has been done many times before, but never with such elan; drugged monarch-to-be must be impersonated by look-alike for coronation, lest kingdom fall into hands of evil half-brother. In the hands of this PERFECT cast (with terrific support by C. Aubrey Smith, a young David Niven, and Mary Astor) the tale becomes a stylish tale of love, intrigue, and derring-do. High points include an astonishingly beautiful Royal Ball, where Colman and Carroll reveal their love; a very funny yet menacing meeting between Colman and Fairbanks, as they discuss the real King's potential fate; and best of all, a MAGNIFICENT climactic swordfight between the pair, as they lunge and parry furiously through the halls of a castle, while exchanging quips and one-liners.This is swashbuckling at it's finest! If you are unfamiliar with Ronald Colman's work, you're in for a treat...Don't miss it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A summary of the best movie of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Prisoner of Zenda, based somewhat obviously on Shakespeare's The Tempest, is a film that has something for everyone. There's action, adventure, romance, suspense, and swashbuckling. It's a historical film, and over the years hasn't really aged, so it remains fantastic 62 years later. The cast is first rate, especially because the male leads-Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven-are so handsome and talented, mainly Doug. In the best role of his career, he wields swords, cigarettes, and sticks with an airy sensuality and was deprived of a much-deserved Oscar nomination. The sets and costumes are so magnificently detailed, that you'll wish it was in color. And the script is perfect, with some very witty lines. And the musical score is excellent. Anyone who wants to see a movie with all the basic ingredients for 110 minutes of sheer entertainment should seek this one out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colman &amp; Fairbanks Jr. Shine in Classic Adventure Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traveling in a Middle European kingdom, an Englishman on a fishing vacation discovers to his astonishment that he is an identical look-alike for the country's king. When the dissipated monarch is unable to attend his own coronation, the Englishman is pressured to impersonate him temporarily. But when he falls in love with the new queen and the real king is kidnapped by an evil half-brother, the Englishman is swept into a world of intrigue &amp; danger he scarcely knew existed. Can he rescue THE PRISONER OF ZENDA without losing his own life?This is one of the great adventure films of the 1930's. Given lavish treatment by Selznick Studios, it is escapist cinema at its most enjoyable.Silky-voiced Ronald Colman is perfectly cast as both the Englishman &amp; the King. He was one of those rare, fortunate actors with great screen charisma - his every moment, every word, is interesting to the viewer. He almost meets his match, though, in Douglas Fairbanks Jr., here playing a charming &amp; completely ruthless young villain. Their rapier fight stands out in a decade full of terrific swordplay.The rest of the cast is equally impressive: lovely Madeleine Carroll, wicked Raymond Massey, frantic Mary Astor, stalwart David Niven and especially wonderful old Sir C. Aubrey Smith, a model of elderly devotion &amp; courage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rousing fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mixed identities, castles, swords, fancy uniforms, Ruritanian romance, royal intrigues -- it's all here. What a lot of fun.I could never really figure out Ronald Coleman's appeal. He's likable enough but from what I gather women used to swoon over him. Is he really handsome? If so, the quality slips past my perceptive apparatus. I do like his voice, though, so theatrically nasal and so hard to take seriously. Raymond Massey is Black Michael, he of the monocle and the perpetual sneer. Mary Astor and Madeleine Carrol are decorative and provide the men with motives. Outstanding, though, is Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., as Rupert of Hentzau. It's often said that a movie is as good as its villain, and that's as true here as in any other film. He laughs, he oozes charm, he beats people over the head with iron pipes, he stabs unarmed noblemen, he seduces women, he drugs kings, seems to enjoy betrayal, smokes too much, lies as easily as the rest of us breathe, and instead of fighting to the end like a man he jumps out a window and runs away, or rather swims away. He quotes poetry: "Oh, woman, in our hour of ease/ uncertain, coy, and hard to please./ When pain and anguish wring the brow/ a ministering angel, thou." David Niven is a lighthearted friend of the hero. C. Aubrey Smith is -- well, C. Aubrey Smith.Niven hadn't gotten very far in Hollywood until he landed this role, which he was able to do only through the influence of Hollywood's "British colony." He began the shoot by playing the part in the breezy manner we now see on screen. This displeased the director and the producer, who wanted it dramatic, but when they saw how it looked on film they were tickled pink. (Both Niven and Fairbanks were to go on to meritorious service in World War II.)The movie is so undemanding and so rewarding that it was remade several times, twice as a spoof. The 1950s version with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr is about as good as this one, only of course splashier.The climax involves a nicely done fight with sabres between Coleman and Fairbanks. Coleman wasn't a physical actor and Fairbanks not a fencer, so doubles are used extensively, but without doing much damage. And it's curious to note that this was released in the same year as "The Adventures of Robin Hood," and both films use some of the same conventions, fighting with furniture, trading wisecracks during the fight, and the use of shadows swashbuckling away on the castle walls. This despite the fact that different directors were in charge. Hard to tell whether this is an instance of independent invention or some historical adhesion left over from one of Fairbanks' dad's early silents.And enjoyable tale, not meant to be taken seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best screen version of Anthony Hope's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of the at least eight film versions of Anthony Hope's famous novel, this is the best. There is a fairly decent silent version starring Ramon Navarro and a flashier 1950's version with Stewart Granger but this one leads the pack as the most entertaining and the best directed. Dashing Douglas Fairbanks Jr. always in the shadow of his famous father gives the role of Rupert all he's got and that's a lot. He steals every scene he's in, even from the likes of Ronald Coleman and Raymond Massey. He gives treachery and deceit not to mention opportunism new meanings in his double dealings. Few today have even heard of Junior, though most movie buffs have heard of his father silent star Douglas Fairbanks and step mother for a time Mary Pickford. Senior divorced Junior's mother to marry Pickford. Junior gave other outstanding performances on the big screen especially in "Gunga Din" in 1939 opposite Cary Grant and Victor McLaglen. He went on to have a popular television show in the early days of that medium "Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Presents." He gradually retired from films. Sadly when he passed away in the year 2000 very few knew who he was. Ronald Coleman gets to play two parts Maj. Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf V, two lookalike cousins from a family indiscretion several generations back. He does so admirably. Though Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia who loves one cousin but is tied to the other out of duty and patriotism is a hard act to follow as always, Mary Astor gives her a good run for the money as Black Michael's (Raymond Massey)lady love. The two ladies counterbalance each other well as stand by your man women but for different reasons. The always underrated and under-appreciated actor Raymond Massey makes the character of Michael come alive with jealousy and vainglory but with true love in his heart for his Antoinette. The grand old man of early cinema C. Aubrey Smith is around to make sure all is done correctly according to pomp and circumstance. David Niven in an early screen role gives his portrayal of Capt. Fritz Von Tarlenheim the easy touch, almost tongue in cheek at times, which lightens the heavy load for the viewers. He is a good counterbalance for the dour C. Aubrey Smith. Silent screen veteran actor Montagu Love is present to show them all how it's done. What a troupe of Thespians to savor!John Cromwell directs with flair and makes the film move at a fast pace especially near the end. The action sequence when the castle is stormed following the lowering of the draw bridge is intense. The rapier fight between Coleman and Fairbanks is still exciting to watch. The crisp black and white photography makes one forget that the film is not in color. For excitement, adventure, and romance by all means see the 1937 version of "The Prisoner of Zenda."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Delightful Classic Adventure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the end of the Nineteenth Century, the Englishman Major Rudolf Rassendyll (Ronald Colman) travels to the Province of Zenda to spend a couple of days fishing at the Royal Game Preserve. He meets King Rudolf V (Ronald Colman), whose coronation will happen on the next day, riding with his loyal Colonel Zapt (C. Aubrey Smith) and Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven) and they all become astonished with the resemblance of Rassendyll and Rudolf V. They conclude that they might be distant cousins and the King invites the newcomer to drink wine in his castle. King Rudolf is an alcoholic and drinks too much; however, he is drugged by his brother Michael (Raymond Massey) and Rudolf V is no able to participate at the ceremony of coronation. Colonel Zapt and Captain Fritz asks Rassendyll to impersonate Rudolf V, otherwise his greedy brother would take his place and be crowned king. Rassendyll accepts to participate in the fraud but when he meets King's Rudolf V fiancée, the Princess Flavia (Madeleine Carroll) of the Royal House Court of Strelsau, the immediately fall in love for each other. Meanwhile, the evil and ambitious Rupert of Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.) abducts Rudolf V and brings him to the dungeons of his castle. However, Michael's mistress Antoinette de Mauban (Mary Astor) secretly summons Rassendyll to her Boulevard Elsberg and proposes to help him to rescue the King. In return, Michael would be exiled without any other additional punishment. Rassendyll accepts to risk his life trying to save Rudolf V, even knowing that his love with Princess Flavia would be affected by his action."The Prisoner of Zenda" is one of the most delightful classic adventures of cinema industry. The performances and the ironic and witty dialogs are awesome and unfortunately this type of film is innocent film that is hardly made by the studios. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): "O Prisioneiro de Zenda" ("The Prisoner of Zenda")</fullReview>

This was one of his first productions as an Independent producer, In choosing Anthony Hope's novel, he made a very wise choice. His casting was even better, he only had the very best available cast at the time.The dashing Ronald Colman as both the King &amp; his cousin.

I think he stole the film from both Colman &amp; Massey.Each &amp; ever one of them plus others were about flawless under John Cromwells fine , polished direction., The Sets were magnificent, so good in fact, they were used in the 1952 version) I will also have a review of this version. The Music was excellent written by Alfred Newnan,The screenplay was wriiten by (among others) Edward Rose, John Balderston,Donald Ogden Stewart Ben Hecht &amp; Sidney Howard.This film was one of the more popular films of its day, Even today these many years later it comes across as a wonderful exciting film.This was filmed in glorious Black &amp; White by James Wong Howe.Today the loves scenes seem a bit dated BUT back then actors in a clinch did not look at one another, the camera had to catch there faces. This tale took place prior to WW 1, I just wonder if people did so much smoking, thats a minor quibble.For a peek at a classic from the 1930's SEE THIS.Ratings ***1/2 (out of 4) 96 points (out of 100) IMDb 9 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "The Prisoner of Zenda", a British major impersonates a foreign king to save his station. The film starts as more of a drama film and makes a transition to action film near the end. It also features nice sets in the old Hollywood style and an appropriate score.The film's cast delivers great performances. Ronald Colman is charming as Major Rudolf Rassendyll. Madeleine Carroll plays Princess Flavia, who is slated to marry the king. Colman and Carroll have chemistry together and nicely develop a relationship. C. Aubrey Smith is well-cast to play the part of Colonel Zapt, the king's loyal helper, and David Niven has a small role, also on the king's support staff. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. creates a memorable villain as the brazen and obnoxious but somewhat clever Rupert of Hentzau. Raymond Massey is decent as the other main villain, Michael, but not on par with Fairbanks.The start of the movie develops the film's premise and then the characters. The film mostly has an interesting story and clever dialogue,but it does have some slower spots in the middle. However, the film makes a transition to an action-oriented approach near the end. This was appropriate and in particular there was one duel with some amusing banter that was a highlight of the action. The film culminates in a satisfactory conclusion and is overall worth seeing for its premise, characters, dialogue and action toward the end.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is based on Anthony Hope's novel and directed by John Cromwell. Over the years, the story has been imitated with many versions. This Black and white offering is so well directed it plays as well in 1937 as in 2011. The lead is played most admirably by Ronald Colman who with his distinctive voice is both Major Rudolf Rassendyll and " The Prisoner of Zenda. " The plot is lead by Black Michael (Raymond Massey) who's facial features are suited for the part of a jealous villain. It is surprising however to see David Niven and Douglas Faitbanks Jr. on opposites sides, but each performs superbly even if Douglas does play a heavy. The inner story is that of a King who is slated for removal by duping the populace that because the king has been killed, Black Michael will assume the thrown in his absence. A later version will have Steward Granger in the title role and in color, but for me, Ronald Coleman will always be the Prisoner of Zenda in this Classic movie.

		<shortDescription>A true swashbuckling classic, but do read the book!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1937 version of 'The Prisoner of Zenda' has been one of my favourite films for most of my life. The performances outshine those of the shot-for-shot 1952 colour remake, while the Peter Sellers spoof deserves to be forgotten...The plot is taken from Anthony Hope's classic 1894 swashbuckling novel. Rudolf Rassendyll, the younger son of a British Earl, distantly related (illegitimately) to the ruling house of Ruritania, is forced to impersonate the new King Rudolf, whose double he is. There are complications, conspiracies and some excellent swordplay. Rudolf has to rescue the abducted King, but falls in love with the beautiful Princess to whom his lookalike is betrothed. The adventure is brought superbly to life by a terrific cast: Ronald Colman as Rudolf Rassendyll and King Rudolf, Madeleine Carroll as Princess Flavia, Douglas Fairbanks jr. as Rupert von Hentzau, Mary Astor as Antoinette de Mauban, C. Aubrey Smith as Colonel Sapt, and a very young David Niven as Fritz von Tarlenheim. Raymond Massey as Duke Michael is perhaps less happily cast (see comments below), but he does well in a role which is, even in the novel, too thinly written for his plot-function.I love this film - it is one of the classics of its genre, and I can only regret that the same team wasn't reunited to make the more tragic sequel, 'Rupert of Hentzau'. The most obvious gaffe I've spotted is the list of stations painted on the door of the train. As Hope-readers know, Ruritania is *not* in the Balkans, but is a German-speaking state between Saxony and the present-day Czech Republic: the nearest major rail-link in the real world is Dresden, therefore the Orient Express is not the best way to get there! Otherwise, the environment of the book is effectively realised. Oddly, the film sets the action in 1897, *after* the novel's publication (1894), whereas the sequel 'Rupert of Hentzau' implies that the events described are a few years in the past - probably c. 1876 for 'The Prisoner of Zenda'.However, I just want to raise a few more points which I hope will encourage viewers to sample the book, too. Enjoyable as the film is, it is not a completely faithful adaptation: in some places, the film works as well as the novel, but in others it loses depth. Both are worthwhile on their own terms. There are one or two ***spoilers*** in here.In the novel, it is very clear that this is a story of young people, and some of the casting in terms of age affects the dynamics of the relationships. While it doesn't matter too drastically that the 2 Rudolfs are here 40-something, not the 29-30 of the book, the script has altered the relationship between King Rudolf and his half-brother Michael. In the film, Michael is older, but (it is implied) illegitimate. In the novel, he is *younger* (probably mid-20s) and legitimate, although by a morganatic marriage; he is popular with the common people (not much in evidence in the film), and the sequel confirms one's suspicions that he could not have been any worse a King than Rudolf. Perhaps the story needs a somewhat more ironic and cynical touch, then, rather than endorsing Sapt's agenda without question?What's more, in the book Antoinette is implied to be one of the 'poules de luxe' or 'grandes horizontales' typical of the era, and is a number of years Michael's senior: which makes her efforts to hang on to him rather more urgent and desperate. Mary Astor is ideal in the role, but she needed a younger partner: had Douglas Fairbanks jr. (an actor of far greater range than is sometimes credited) been cast as the intense, politically frustrated Michael, the relationship would have struck the right note. But then, one would have needed to cast someone like Errol Flynn as Rupert, and, fun though he is in swashbucklers, I'm not sure that would have worked.Douglas Fairbanks jr. is a superb Rupert, and in many ways steals the show from Colman's gentlemanly Rassendyll and drunken playboy King Rudolf. He has style, swagger and sex appeal. What he is weaker on is the character's streak of sheer viciousness. When Rassendyll observes that he's a "bad-tempered fellow, underneath the charm", we never *quite* believe it of *this* Rupert. He's more of a dashing rogue than the novel's polished but out-and-out treacherous juvenile thug: the film's Rupert is a cad, but he doesn't attempt rape. The film makes the big sword-fight a duel between Rupert and *Rudolf Rassendyll*, rather than between Rupert and *Michael* - which is understandable in box-office terms, but sadly means we lose *another* terrifically dramatic scene: Antoinette, in her bloodstained nightdress, going after Rupert with a pistol.In conclusion: this is one of *the* all-time great adventure films. Never miss an opportunity to see it, but don't forget to read the books, too! (They are now available on-line.)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless Adventure/Love Story Told in the Grand Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I were to be left on a deserted island and had but one film to watch while I passed the time of day, "Prisoner of Zenda" would be that movie.Of course it is not perfect. Some of the dialog and scenes seem dated by today's more cynical standards, and perhaps the characters lack the complexity seen in more contemporary films.But I know of no other movie that tells its rousing story with such dash and style, while at the same time glorifying nobility of character, loyalty, honor, decency, tradition and self-sacrifice. Altogether, this is the film that shows the Old Hollywood skill of story telling at its very best, and leaves you feeling better for the opportunity to watch the great adventure and romance unfold before your very eyes.Ronald Colman is virtually unknown today----and his presentation of the gentleman hero is decidedly old fashioned. But you believed in him and the innate integrity he brought to all his characterizations. Madeleine Carroll is a classic blond beauty perfectly cast as the princess destined to marry a king but who gives her heart to his look alike commoner cousin.The rest of the stellar cast is outstanding. Many have pointed out how Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. as Rupert of Hentzau stole the picture as the charming villain, and they may well be right. Too bad that he got so few opportunities to show the full range of his acting ability. This is probably his best role.Many---perhaps most of the values demonstrated in "Prisoner of Zenda" may appear rather quaint to us today. This is not because they are irrelevant. Our present society has significantly lowered the bar for what constitutes good behavior and more readily accepts and forgives what amounts to bad behavior. So-----be transported in time to a world where chivalry was still in style and honor was a virtue to be cherished. You will not be disappointed!This is one of the truly great films to come out of the Golden Age of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My favorite swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a kid I read the Anthony Hope novel and loved the Stewart Granger film version of it. As an adult, I discovered the Ronald Colman version (upon which the Granger film was based, scene by scene, camera angle by camera angle), and since Colman is one of my all-time favorite actors (the personification of British suave), I fell in love with it. Every member of the supporting cast of the later version is superb, but can't quite beat Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., Raymond Massey, Mary Astor, and David Niven. It's become my all-time favorite swashbuckler. A tale of a reluctant hero and a bittersweet romance with lots of action and witty dialog, it compares favorably with another, slightly later tale of a reluctant hero and a bittersweet romance, "Casablanca." I can't wait for the DVD to come out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Douglas Fairbanks Sr. may have invented film swashbuckling, but Junior makes it his own in this one!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my all-time favorites. I watched it again a few nights ago. Fairbanks is a marvel. Princess Flavia's dilemma at the end always reminds me a little bit of Elsa Laslo's dilemma in "Casablanca." (Although Madeleine Carroll's acting seems highly stylized today.) The best part of that scene is the scenery--the lighting and the window's arch as it frames the two lovers. It's achingly beautiful. If I had a room like that I would never leave it. But the film as a whole is not a three-hanky affair--it's got swashbuckling, snappy dialog and lots of old movie conventions. (C. Aubrey Smith is an old movie convention in himself.) I definitely keep coming back to it to watch Fairbanks as Rupert of Hentzau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>fantastic adventure film--highly reminiscent of Errol Flynn's best films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably Ronald Coleman's best film, though he does have other terrific films to his credit. Why is it so good? Well, the pacing is brisk, the story engaging, acting superb and the supporting cast is dynamite--how can you fail when you are supported by the likes of the David Niven, Dougals Fairbanks, Jr. and C. Aubrey Smith?! PLUS, Rayond Massey is great as the menacing villain leader--part Jonathan Brewster (from Arsenic and Old Lace) and part Snidley Whiplash (from Bullwinkle). Plus Madeleine Carroll is so beautiful and captivating I could see how Coleman would have a terrible time letting go of her! The story starts in a small mythical kingdom. It seems on the eve of his coronation, the king-to-be is drugged by the evil villain. It just so happens that the good guys have stumbled on an exact double of the indisposed king and they ask this very surprised chap to sit in for the king. He reluctantly agrees but it is for a lot more than he expects after the king-to-be is kidnapped and he must remain king for the foreseeable future! This is rousing adventure in the grandest tradition! If you love films such as Captain Blood and the Adventures of Robinhood, you will be in for a real treat if you watch this film.NOTE: The entire movie was re-filmed nearly scene for scene in the 1950s with Stewart Granger in the lead. It, too, is an excellent film but offers nothing significantly better than the original. My advice is to try the original first--as overall it's a little bit better. ALSO, Peter Sellars did an unbelievably terrible version of this film in 1979. Avoid it unless you are into masochism.NEWER NOTE: I reviewed this wonderful movie a couple years back and tonight I was surprised to see Ronald Coleman is a very, very, very similar film called THE MASQUERADER (1933) in which he once again plays two roles of people who are supposed to be identical but not twins. Considering that this is a bit of a silly cliché and that he did THE MASQUERADER several years earlier, this makes THE PRISONER OF ZENDA a bit less original than I'd earlier thought, so I am now scoring the movie with a 9 instead of a 10. It's still a lovely film--just not quite so original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the greatest movies of all time!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As my summary line might suggest, this is a movie that I have tremendous affection for and is one of the few movies I can watch again and again without a twinge of boredom.This particular version of Hope's novel has to be the most supremely romantic film of all time. The combination of seven fantastic lead actors, a very witty script, excellent production values, tight direction, and good taste from all concerned make this a film that *must* be seen, and can be enjoyed by anyone of any age. It is, simply, a timeless masterpiece.It must be said that the monumental achievement is Colman's for his brilliant portrayal of King and commoner. It is true that there are some parts of this film that have not aged well, and the story itself is only a thin (though classic!) adventure yarn, but out of this Colman has created a masterful portrait of a humane and dutiful hero and his flawed but equally interesting counterpart. It is Colman's quiet and absolutely accurate acting that stirs me most, although one cannot ignore the talents of his superlative co-stars. All in all, it is an ensemble acting film with Colman at the top--as it should be.I envy anyone their first viewing of this remarkable film. It will not soon be forgotten even as flashier and louder thrillers invade our filmgoing consciousness.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yes, Ronald Colman IS that handsome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In reply to someone who questioned whether or not Ronald Colman was as handsome as people say, I add a resounding YES! He has real Hollywood Golden Age glamour. I don't have a lot to add to what other fans of Prisoner of Zenda have said, but it is a classic romantic swashbuckler. It is far superior to the remake with Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr. I love seeing Ronald Colman shake hands with Ronald Colman. I also love the scene when Colman enters the cathedral for his coronation -- he is every inch a king and no one would guess he is an imposter -- however, you sense that he is walking into a place he has never been before. Now that is subtle acting. If you haven't seen it, you are in for a real treat. The men, led by Colman, are all magnificent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old-fashioned swashbuckler is still a rollicking good time for all...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only ingredient missing in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA ('37) is Technicolor, but it's masterfully photographed by James Wong Howe in glorious B&amp;W and the cast is exceptionally fine.The story is the familiar one about a man forced to masquerade as a King of a fictional country (Ruritania) while all sorts of intrigue and cunning schemes are going on at the palace. RONALD COLMAN has the central role and MADELEINE CARROLL is the gorgeous aristocratic Princess Flavia that he falls in love with.Produced in lavish style by David O. Selznick, with stirring music by Alfred Newman and directed by John Cromwell, it's the sort of escapist entertainment audiences needed then--and now.DOUGLAS FAIRBANKS, JR. plays the wicked Rupert of Hentzau with devilish charm, the man who is in on an audacious plan to hold the real King Rupert hostage for ransom, and RAYMOND MASSEY does his usual villainous turn as Michael, the prisoner of Zenda's brother, the man who wants the throne for himself. In a small role as Massey's wife, MARY ASTOR makes almost no impression at all.On the debit side, there's a strictly 1930's storybook flavor to the way the story is told, particularly the love scenes between Colman and Carroll. Their histrionics get a little too over-heated during that final scene during which her nobility in willing to forget "a moment of madness" seems more like a story contrivance. True love never does run smooth, not here and not in Shakespeare.The duel between Colman and Fairbanks is well staged and makes an exciting finale for a slow-paced tale that becomes a bit too talky at times. Still, despite obvious drawbacks, it's an entertaining story told with a dashing amount of romance and intrigue. Madeleine Carroll was never more beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ronald Colman duels Douglas Fairbanks Jr.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He has the appearance and manner of the king, yet he's really a lookalike? and on his shoulders rests all hope of foiling a blackguard's plot to usurp the throne. Adventure, pageantry and royal intrigue are forged at sword point in the two finest screen versions of the beloved 1894 novel filmed many times," according to the Warner Home Video release, "Ronald Colman plays the double role in the resilient 1937 David O. Selznick production (Side A), making palpable the heartbreak of the royal stand-in whose gallantry is tested by his love for the real king's fiancée (Madeleine Carroll). Stewart Granger stars in the eye-filling 1952 color version (Side B), romancing Deborah Kerr and wielding bold steel in the film's bravura climactic duel." Thanks to whoever at Warner/Turner decided to release these two versions of "The Prisoner of Zenda" together. Considering the way things are usually handled in Hollywood, the obvious has become inspired. Adding extra movies, for less than the price of two (or more), also encourages sales. They could have added "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1922) for even better measure, assuming the three "Metro" features are owned by Warner Bros. Of the two available here, the 1937 "black-and-white" version wins the sword fight, though the 1952 color version is inoffensive and beautifully photographed (by Joseph Ruttenberg).Examined together, the three films support the widely held belief that the more villainous role in a drama is often the one to act. In this case, observe how the character "Rupert of Hentzau" supports this thesis. In the 1927 version, the role made Ramon Novarro a star. In the 1937 and 1952 versions, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and James Mason are always above or equal to anyone else in the cast. The fact that Mr. Colman can his own against Mr. Fairbanks helps make their version a classic. Lewis Stone appears in two versions, and Louis Calhern played the lead on stage. In each case, "The Prisoner of Zenda" is an attractive production.******** The Prisoner of Zenda (9/2/37) John Cromwell ~ Ronald Colman, Madeleine Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., C.

The 1952 film is also pretty good, if lacking this film's unique charm and wit, but it is this 1937 film that strikes a chord with me. It looks wonderful, with the cinematography, costumes and sets all top-drawer and Alfred Newman's score superb. There is also a witty script, a wonderful story and excellent direction that lifts this film even brighter. The acting is top notch. Ronald Colman is wonderfully assured in his dual role, and David Niven is also great as are Raymond Massey and the beautiful Mary Astor. But it is Douglas Fairbanks Jnr who walks away with the movie as Rupert. Overall, this terrific movie has got the whole package. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superb Swashbuckling Fantasy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Ronald Colman radiates charisma in the dual role of monarch and impostor in director John Cromwell's "The Prisoner of Zenda," epic saga of intrigue, romance and swordplay, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., steals the show as the audacious amoral Count Rupert of Hentzau in an exuberant performance rivaling anything that his matinée idol father ever did. Not only does Rupert defy our hero and his cohorts, but he also thumbs his nose at the chief villain and his accomplices. Beautiful Madeleine Carroll of "The 39-Steps" co-stars as the love interest Princess Flavia, while Raymond Massey scowls arrogantly behind his monocle as the chief villain. Mary Astor, David Niven, and C. Aubrey Smith flesh out a dazzling cast. This lively, 101-minute, black and white, United Artists swashbuckler was the fourth cinematic adaptation of Anthony Hope's popular Victorian novel about dual identities and high court skullduggery when the king's scheming illegitimate half-brother tries to usurp him and claim the crown for himself. Countless scenarists, among them John L. Balderston of "Dracula" fame as well as Ben Hecht of "Scarface: Shame of the Nation" and Sidney Howard, penned the elaborate screenplay. The first two-thirds of "The Prisoner of Zenda" establishes the setting, situation, and characters, while the last third of this lavish costumer delivers thrills and chills, especially a swordfight between Colman and Fairbanks.An Englishman, Major Rudolf Rassendyll (Ronald Colman of "Goodbye, Mr. Chips"), embarks on a holiday to indulge in his penchant for fishing. When he arrives in the small kingdom of Ruritania, Rudolf finds everybody eyeballing him and bothering him about the upcoming coronation. Rudolf has no idea why they are scrutinizing him and he states that he has no intention of attending any coronation. Later, while he is fishing on a game preserve, two of King Rudolph's men accost him and comment about his amazing resemblance to Lord Rudolph V. Indeed, Rudolf turns out to be the sovereign's distant cousin. Rudolph (Ronald Colman in a dual role) invites Rudolf to join him for wine at his royal hunting lodge. Rudolf observes that the king quaffs liquor to excess. After everybody has passed out from too much drink, the future king has one last drink that knocks him out for the long run. Colonel Zapt (crusty C. Aubrey Smith of "Little Lord Fauntleroy") has Captain Fritz von Tarlenheim (David Niven of "The Charge of the Light Brigade ") stash the unconscious Rudolf in the wine cellar until the king recovers. Later, Zapt persuades an initially reluctant Rudolf to masquerade for a day as the man scheduled to be crowned. "If he's not crowned today," Zapt grimly assures Rudolf, "he'll never be crowned." Imagine the surprise and consternation of His Highness Duke Michael (Raymond Massey of "Desperate Journey") when the coronation proceeds as planned. Michael refuses to be thwarted so easily. Rudolph's civility and sobriety surprises Flavia, while Rudolf is quite captivated by her beauty. Princess Flavia's memories of Rudolph's dreadful behavior toward her years before vanish. Of course, Flavia hasn't the slightest clue about the charade perpetrated by Rudolf. Everything seems to be going well for our heroes some 42 minutes into the plot as they return to the hunting lodge to let the real Rudolph resume his rightful place as monarch. Our heroes learn Rupert has kidnapped Rudolph and Michael is equally as surprised. Of course, the villains cannot blow the trumpet on the heroes without incriminating themselves, too.Incredibly, Michael doesn't learn about Rudolf's impersonation until Rupert informs him about it some 58 minutes into the action. At this point, rapacious Rupert negotiates terms from Michael for Rudolph. Meanwhile, Rupert lures Rudolf to a rendezvous after midnight at a deserted summer house behind the wall on the Boulevard Elphberg with Antoinette de Mauban (Mary Astor of "The Kennel Murder Case") to learn the whereabouts of the King. Antoinette warns Rudolf that Rupert is bringing two other men to kill him. She strikes a bargain with Rudolf to free Rudolph as long as no harm befalls Michael. Of course, Michael knows nothing of Antoinette's treachery. She informs Rudolf that Michael has moved Rudolph from a woodcutter's cabin to Michael's castle near Zenda. Further, she tells him that they are prepared to kill Rudolph if Rudolf tries to storm the castle. She agrees to help Rudolf rescue Rudolph and hands him an earring as a sign. Once she formulates a plan for Rudolph's rescue, she will send a servant with the matching earring. Rupert and his men arrive and try to kill Rudolf, but our protagonist escapes. By now Flavia knows about Rudolf's sham. Later, Rupert meets Rudolf at the King's hunting lodge and tries to kill him. Antoinette's servant arrives and explains that he will lower the drawbridge after midnight. One man must swim the moat, scale the castle to Antoinette's room, and reach the dungeon before the guards can murder the king.Again, the best thing about "The Prisoner of Zenda" is Fairbanks' mischievous performance and his treachery toward his own people. The surprise here is that he manages to escape after he kills Michael. Reportedly, producer David 0. Selznick brought in MGM helmer W.S. Van Dyke to restage the climactic action sequences at Michael's castle where Rudolf has to sneak inside despite heavy odds and free the monarch. The swordfight between Rupert and Rudolf and the cavalry charge across the drawbridge is pretty exhilarating stuff that has lost little of its verve. Horsemen gallop across the drawbridge and some crash their horses, virtually plunging them into the camera. This film received two Academy Award nominations: Lyle R. Wheeler for Best Art Direction and Alfred Newman for Best Music Score. "The Prisoner of Zenda" ranks as an above-average escapade with witty dialogue and good performances, especially gorgeous Madeline Carroll who grows quite fond of the impostor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lookalike cousin comes in handy when a king-in-waiting falls victim to tainted wine. Lots of pomp and ceremonial ritual add luster to this romantic adventure, set in Europe in the late nineteenth century.A convincing performance by Ronald Colman in dual roles helps. C. Aubrey Smith plays his usual gruff self, as Col. Zapt, who masterminds the devious scheme to prevent a villainous brother, effectively played by Raymond Massey, from ascending the throne. The impersonation plot has just enough suspense and humor to hold one's interest.There's more than a hint of romanticized nostalgia in the tone, helped along by regal background music. Consistent with the styles and customs of that historical era, costumes trend stiff and formal. B&amp;W cinematography is quite impressive. Some scenes have a medieval look and feel, especially that island castle.The fencing match is stagy but fun. Both men seem to enjoy fighting to the death, exchanging clever quips. "Stand still and fight, you coward", says one character. His opponent responds: "Bad tempered fellow, aren't you, underneath the charm". This match goes on for several minutes, and is played in a tongue-in-cheek manner.For romantics everywhere, "The Prisoner Of Zenda" is a timeless classic. It's movie making in the old fashioned way, with a clever story, good acting, and some fine camera work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the last truly great romantic swashbucklers that only improves by comparison!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE PRISONER OF ZENDA premiered September 3rd of 1937 and was produced by David O. Selznick and distributed by United Artists. It is the best of five film versions based on the book by Anthony Hope. Hope was born a poor preachers son who worked his way up to being an unsuccessful lawyer before he failed at writing. But he persisted until his 3rd book PRISONER OF ZENDA and its sequel made him rich and famous. The 1913 film version was made by Edwin S. Porter, director of the 1903 GREAT TRAIN ROBBERY. The 1922 version was so successful a sequel was made by producer Lewis Selznick, the father of tonight's film producer David O. Selznick! So David grew up a fan of the book and his father's silent film. In 1933 MGM planned on making a musical version with Nelson Eddy &amp; Jeanette MacDonald. In 1935 MGM thought again they would make a non-musical version but cast THIN MAN stars William Powell and Myrna Loy. But it was super producer Selznick who hit upon the idea in 1937 because of the current media frenzy over the recent coronation of Britain's King Edward VIII who abdicated the thrown to marry a commoner out of true love in 1936! From the opening shot of over thirty trumpeters heralding the start of major work of art producer David O. Selznick wanted to top A TALE OF TWO CITIES made just two years earlier and also starring Ronald Colman, and he does. Ronald Colman was at his peak getting $200,000 for this one film. In the same period he made LOST HORIZON, IF I WERE KING and THE LIGHT THAT FAILED. The cinematography was by a Chinese born American named James Wong Howe. He is considered a legendary master today and there are two completely different shots I want you to look for: the first is halfway through the story when Colman and Carroll arrive at the ball and the camera starts with them being announced and coming through a doorway. That's where I want you to start holding your breath and see if you can hold it until the end of the shot, as they descend the white stairs and the camera slowly pulls back and up and up? over 100 feet and reveals the full size of the room. There is some cute comedy relief in the next scene provided by the Orchestra leader who is played by Al Shean who was in real life, uncle to the Marx Brothers. The next shot is later and much more intimate where Raymond Massey and Fairbanks are in a dark room only lit by a fireplace and they sit in two large chairs with their backs to the camera. Our point of view stays behind them and we just watch, as if we were actually in the room ease dropping. Today the scene would be cut into 25 quick edits and unnecessary close-ups. David Niven was just starting out (he's listed just above the cook in the credits) and the director was under utilizing him so Niven improvised some humor and was actually fired until Selznick &amp; director John Cromwell viewed the dailies and decided to let Niven improvise even more thus making him a star. Director John Cromwell was known as a woman's director who mixed lavish, spectacular scenes with warm and tender love scenes and he is the father of current actor James Cromwell who was the understanding farmer in BABE and the corrupt police captain in LA CONFIDENTIAL. Black Michael in case you did not know he is the bad guy and is played with dark vengeance by Raymond Massey. David Niven and Raymond Massey who both starred together in THE PRISONER OF ZENDA (1937) and A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH (1946) both died on the same day, July 29th 1983. And beautiful Mary Astor of MALTESE FALCON fame is the scheming femme fetal who loves bad men. The stunning blonde beauty Madeline Carroll (she would later say this was her favorite role) was the most successful actress in England at the time. She was so attractive, it is said, Alfred Hitchcock never got over his crush on her while make THE 39 STEPS and forever cast blonds who looked like her as his female leads for the rest of his career. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is the curly haired and handsome henchman with the smile on his lips and danger in his eyes. He originally did not want to take a supporting role but asked his famous father about it. Doug senior (who practically invented swashbucklers) told him he had to do it, PRISONER OF ZENDA was one of the best romances written in a hundred years and always a success and the part of Rupert is probably one of the best villains ever written. He's witty, irresistible and as sly as Iago. Whoever plays Rupert in any stage production in any country, will always be a hit, event though the leading part is a double role. The part is actor-proof, in fact Rin-Tin-Tin could play the part and walk away with it! When the film was first screened for a preview audience it went over only OK and Selznick realized the beginning was too long and since LOST HORIZON another Colman film made that year had it's beginning taken away to speed up the story, that's what he did to PRISONER OF ZENDA, chop off the prologue and epilogue. He also brought in another director W. S. van Dyke to beef up the fencing scenes even more. Douglas and Colman spare with words while mixing with swords in a carefully choreographed fight scene that shows they trained with an Olympic gold winning fencing master! And he then hired Alfred Newman to write a new score and BAM, what an improvement it made!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hopes's classic tale turned into a classic adventure film with Ronald Coleman as the King and his commoner cousin who must masquerade as the king when he's first drugged into unconsciousness so he can't be crowned and later when the king is kidnapped. Its a rousing tale with a dynamite romance. It's been filmed numerous times and this one is probably the best. I put the Stewart Granger one a half step behind this one because James Mason isn't as evil as Douglas Fairbanks Jr as Rupert of Hentzau. You don't get casts better than this since it has Coleman, Madeline Carol, Fairbanks, David Niven, Raymond Massey, Mary Astor and C Aubrey Smith. You also don't get scripts better than this, the Granger version essentially used the same script so that as it ran I was quoting dialog and making my dad go "I thought you never saw this before". Possibly one of the best adventure films Hollywood ever made, I can't recommend it enough...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not going to try to outdo the preceding remarks regarding "Zenda" with it's superlative cast and their matchless performances I will however, give my opinion of the high point of this great film. Colman enters the cathedral in the coronation scene masquerading as King Rudolf and is confronted by the king's brother, Duke Michael. The hatred that radiates from Massey's regard of Colman is so powerful that it can actually be felt by the viewer! Colman(being Colman)is not to be outdone. His response is to regard Massey with wonder and amazement at the level of hatred directed at him, now realizing the true extent of the duke's malice. A truly remarkable scene between two great actors, no dialog needed from these two. A rarely achieved moment in moviedom -- perhaps overlooked as a rule due to its brevity. Another scene like it in films does not immediately come to mind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Cromwell directed, David O. Selznick produced, and Ronald Colman, Madeline Carroll, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., and David Niven star in the 1937 film "The Prisoner of Zenda." That's really all any viewer needs to know.Rudolph Rassendyll (Colman), King Rudolf V's identical cousin, is asked to impersonate the kidnapped future king (Colman) at the coronation. Otherwise, the crown goes to his younger brother.This is a top-notch film with a great performance by Ronald Colman in a dual role, something he was called upon to do during his career several times. Colman was an smooth actor of great charm. One of the comments (from a man, of course) asked if he was supposed to be handsome because if he was, the commenter couldn't see it. Just an opinion: Colman was good-looking in the style of actors in the early to mid-thirties, but it was his gentle quality, beautiful speaking voice, and fine acting that put him over with female audiences. Here his fiancé is the gorgeous Madeleine Carroll, and they make a wonderful couple.Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is one of my favorite actors, and he performs the villainous Rupert with panache, creating an excellent character. Raymond Massey is another villain, Michael, and he's very good. David Niven is in a small role - he's on his way up as a younger Colman - in fact, he was supposed to play Colman's brother in Lost Horizon.The end of the film is total action with a magnificent swordfight. Don't miss this version of Prisoner of Zenda.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Doppleganger Saves The Day</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ronald Colman in his second outing playing a dual role. The Masquerader being the first, is an Englishman come to the mythical Balkan kingdom of Zenda for a little fishing R&amp;R. Nobody's more astonished than he to discover that he's a dead ringer for the monarch about to be crowned. The king is also played by Colman.Crowned unless he can overcome his own dissolute character and the machinations of his half brother Raymond Massey. And there's another guy in there, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., who's got his own agenda working while aligned with Massey. The women aren't out of the picture either. Colman the king is set to marry his cousin Madeleine Carroll who's in line for the succession herself. If he can elbow Colman out of the way, Massey would like her for himself. That does not sit well with Mary Astor the woman who is crushing out big time on him.The king's two trusted aides, C. Aubrey Smith and David Niven, discover Colman the traveler and introduce him to Colman the king. At the hunting lodge of the king, the king gets slipped a present from one Michael Finn and he's out of it on the day of the coronation.With Massey ready to declare martial law and assume the crown himself, Smith and Niven count it as divine providence that the other Colman is there. He takes the king's place and gets crowned the ruler of Zenda. But Massey and Fairbanks aren't through by any means.I counted nine different versions of this novel for the screen, including three silent films and one animated version. Still this one sets the standard. Everyone is so well suited for their parts.It certainly is one of Ronald Colman's most beloved characterizations, both of them. He essays both the character of the weak king who summons up enough grit to take on the job and the carefree English traveler that maybe providence did put in the right spot.The Prisoner of Zenda marked the return of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. to the American screen and as he relates it in his memoirs he wasn't flooded with good offers. He was reluctant to take on the part of Rupert of Hentzau as he had not taken swashbuckling roles deliberately so as not to be compared to his father.But Fairbanks did ask dad and his father said that his role is the best one in the story, that he wished he was young enough to do it himself and that he should run not walk to accept the part. Fairbanks did and he got rave reviews as the charming, but deadly Rupert. The Prisoner of Zenda's release was timely indeed with memories of the abdication of Edward VIII who would not step up to the plate and do his duty by his country. C. Aubrey Smith's admonitions about doing one's duty to Colman the king were exactly what Stanley Baldwin and others were trying to beat into Mr. Windsor's head.Though a good version of this was done in the Fifties by Stewart Granger and James Mason, this one is still by far the best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If you must see this film, ignore the 1952 Technicolor version--this version is one of my all-time favorite films!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Since I'm a fan of unusual romantic and adventurous stories, I immediately fell in love with this film at the age of 15. I was so interested in seeing it that I ignored my father's curfew rule one school night and watched the film on TCM. While watching the film, I was fascinated by the simple, unique story of political and royal intrigue set in an imaginary 19th Century European kingdom. The film was so influential that I soon began daydreaming and writing my own adventurous stories of ruling and residing in an imaginary European country of my own creation, which I am still doing unto this day. This particular film, along with my all-time favorite THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938), also inspired me to take up fencing lessons in high school. Due to my obvious enthusiasm in class, I received a high final score of 98 out of 100 points after battling some tough opponents for two years in the fencing class.On my 18th birthday, I finally received this wonderful classic film on VHS as a present from my father. Since then I've watched it many times and the story is always entertaining due to its uniqueness. And now the film is finally released on a double-feature DVD, containing the inferior 1952 scene-for-scene remake and looking and sounding far superior than my scratchy, faded, and fuzzy VHS.But I'll try to be brief in praising the vastly superior 1937 version?almost everything is perfect in this version. The direction is focused and effective. The extravagant production design is wholesomely convincing, making the audience believe that they are part of the fanciful European settings and not looking at studio sets. The black-and-white cinematography, by the great James Wong Howe, is atmospheric and menacing when it needs to be?whereas the 1952 remake looks a bit effeminate due to its quaint use of lavish Technicolor. The rousing, romantic music score by Alfred Newman is memorable and includes several classical source music pieces throughout in order to enhance the period detail. The pacing is nice and leisurely despite a few occasional lulls here and there in the fanciful, imaginative story. And the dialog, especially coming from the villainous Rupert of Hentzau (Douglas Fairbanks Jr.), is very clever and never fades into banality.And the casting is very nearly perfect. Since this is the version I first saw, it's very hard to imagine anyone else in the lead roles, let alone in the smallest bit roles. However, I have one problem concerning the casting: I would have preferred the young and fresh Olivia de Havilland in the small yet pivotal role of Antoinette de Mauban, since Mary Astor looked old enough to be Douglas Fairbank's mother in the film. Too bad David Selznick, the film's producer, didn't cast Olivia in the role?and this film was made during preproduction of Selznick's GONE WITH THE WIND (1939). Other than that, I have no complaints on the casting. But it does look odd seeing the young, devilishly charming Fairbanks flirting with Astor, who looks homely enough to be middle-aged?to me, at least.If there's one other thing that had room for improvement in this film, it's the climactic duel scene between Rudolph Rassendyll (Ronald Colman) and Rupert within the dim chambers of Zenda Castle. For a time, I thought that it was a great yet brief duel scene in a classic film. While recently watching the 1952 remake, I noticed that the duel scene was much more imaginatively and elaborately staged that time?and even better filmed, since many of the shots of Colman and Fairbanks were mere close-ups in the 1937 version. So now I wish that the duel between Colman and Fairbanks was staged almost exactly like the one in the 1952 version. However, much of the witty banter between the two men was lost in the remake's duel scene. Still, an improved duel scene would have been just as innovative as the duel scene between Errol Flynn and Basil Rathbone in THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD.All in all, this is a superb yet obscure romantic adventure film that tackles an unusual subject?imaginary countries?and makes it work extremely well. Too bad it doesn't receive the strong recognition it deserves within today's generation, since many people my age tend to recoil upon seeing a black-and-white film...as well as hearing about my own imaginary country, Vasaria, due to its obvious unreality and its historical and escapist features.God save the king...and hail Vasaria!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie stars Ronald Colman in a duel role as a Englishman who just arrived in a European country just to relax and fish. He runs into some guards who are amazed at how much he looks like the guy who is about to be named king. Colman and the future king get really drunk and when colman passes out, the future king drinks some drugged wine and is knocked out for several hours so he can't be named king. So Colman has to take his place but they find out that his brother, Raymond Massey, has kidnapped the king because he wants to be king. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. is on Massey's side but really only cares about himself. David Niven and Mary Astor also star and you can find out about the plot when you watch it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fairbanks!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An Englishman on a Ruritarian holiday must impersonate the king when the rightful monarch, a distant cousin, is drugged and kidnapped. (Of the many film adaptations, this is considered by many to be the definitive version.) This production was "one of the last great gatherings of the Hollywood English" before World War II. Producer Selznick was partly inspired to take on the project because of the abdication of Edward VIII, and exploited this angle in his marketing of the film. Indeed, this likely heightened American interest in the English royal family, especially as far as their romances were concerned.This is probably the first film to be set in Ruritania, though not the last. Most interesting, in my opinion, is how this film was the direct inspiration for the uniforms of "Star Trek". Any fan of the "Trek" films ought to see this just to appreciate the history of the uniform.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Time has not been kind to this cliché ridden matinée style tale. It has an OK look, some good names in the cast but director Cromwell had not yet developed his best form (he was much better as years went by)If you grew up enjoying this film, you probably still will, others might need to beware. Selznick was known for quality works but not a great deal has survived in this production. Lighting and general photography is good (though the TCM Australian print is very poor). The early Alfred Newman score is colorful, Coleman is as grand as always (but even he looks uncomfortable within this silly situation). Fairbanks makes a formidably evil villain but editing is sloppy and screenplay somewhat stale. May have been good in its day, but.....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is everything one wants in a movie action, romance, intrigue and this production hits it one the nose. The story is set in a kingdom where their is intrigue behind the proclamation of the new king. The story involves the man who would be king, his evil half brother and an interloper who is related distantly. Well the movie moves with speed and elan the princess is gorgeous and beguiling. The fight scenes are ripe with flare and bravado. The acting superb by the leads and the supporting cast superb. This movie is in the grandest stage of classic movie making as it takes good story material and makes it alive. To me as an avid movie watcher this is why sometimes older movies are great as the story and production are memorable unlike too many movies of this generation which seem to much copy and paste and generic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Swashbuckling perfection</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1937 version of The Prisoner of Zenda ranks up there with the best swashbucklers of Old Hollywood, even The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938). It has everything: action and romance, humor and poignancy, all of which combine beautifully. It has a sense of glamor and soft-focus fantasy which modern cinema finds unfashionable; such a shame, because when it's done well, as it is in Zenda, the results are unforgettable.The cast is perfection: Ronald Colman, Mary Astor, Madeline Caroll, and of course, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., one of the best and most charming screen villains ever. The action scenes are shot with great verve and the romance, while a bit cheesy at times, comes off splendidly. Though they know one another for only about a day, you really believe Colman and Caroll are soul mates.Fifteen years later, this classic was remade shot for shot and in color, but wouldn't you know it, it was not nearly as fun or memorable. Instead of being unique, it tried too hard to copy a nearly perfect movie. Out of all the many Zenda adaptations that have ever been, the 1937 film is the one to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ruritanian High Watermark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No coincidence that this film about a negligent, pleasure-loving monarch should have appeared in 1937. It was actually meant to point a discreet finger at the fugitive King Edward VIII, with war fast approaching, and notions of duty and leadership suddenly front-of-mind.This was not the first or last dramatisation of the Anthony Hope novel that put Ruritania on the map - feeding a strong psychological need to believe in a recent, yet quite mythical age 'when history still wore a rose'.The mythology is easy to sneer-at now, with an imaginary Balkan state rescued from anarchy by clean-limbed young English-speakers professing the public-school virtues of decency and fair play. But this film was unusually blessed - in the eyes of the viewing public, if not of the production team. And whatever the backstage disagreements, it must go down as a triumph of casting and direction.At its heart was the well-kept and photogenic Ronald Colman, still just young enough to play the suitor, and somehow able to conceal the limp that came with his war-wound, while at least looking as though he was fencing as nimbly and wholeheartedly as the best of them.Colman arrives in Ruritania as an English sporting gent (Rassendyll), hoping for a few days' fishing. But he soon learns that he is the split-image of his distant cousin, the new King, due to be crowned next day. By chance, he is introduced to the King, who is greatly amused at meeting his own double, and entertains him to a lavish dinner, where the King is the only one left awake to drink the drugged wine, sent by his jealous half-brother Michael (Raymond Massey).It is betraying no more than the obvious, if we reveal that the King is not capable of attending his own coronation, and Rassendyll is put under pressure to dress-up and be crowned in his place, while the King is recovering.But if only it were that simple...Along the way, we get Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in his greatest film role as Michael's swashbuckling sidekick Rupert, competing for Mary Astor in her most glamorous appearance as Michael's lover; and Madeleine Carroll, a vision of loveliness and virtue as the future Queen. All presided-over by Aubrey Smith, the ex-England cricketer whose weekend matches so intrigued Hollywood, and brought attention to the young David Niven, who plays his deputy, Fritz.The near-perfect direction is spoiled by three things. Towards the climax, we can't quite keep up with the intricacies of the sub-plot, or grasp which location we're at (mostly outdoors at night). When it comes to the duelling scenes, the dialogue is even more bogus than you expect, with too many comic-strip challenges to chivalric honour. And the final scene between Rudolf and Flavia is disappointingly mechanical and rushed, as their earlier scenes are not.Overall, though, this film manages to distil its various elements into something bigger than just Danubian waltzes and duels - a rare cinematic moment, never to be eclipsed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic Escapism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ah the Hollywood studio system...Ah the Costume Epic...Ah the Swashbuckler.There are many films that fans of romantic escapism can enjoy and this is one of them. This type of thing set the Women's hearts on fire and this is what passed as rousing adventure for the pre-media generation of young and virile men.It was a time when movies were making the popular culture transition from ink to celluloid as the preferred mass communication. Literature and the projected light would co exist as the masterful dual dynamos of popular entertainment until post War civilization was awakened to a new form of radiated consciousness.To call this kind of stuff dated is accurate if meant in a respectful manner, because it is, but it is also wonderful, and artful and a beautiful time piece of a more innocent time. This has all the ingredients of that period and place when expectations were of virtuous, larger than life, handsome, and beautiful people beyond the realm. These actors would never mumble and these characters would never fail to inspire and Good won out over Evil.This is a spot on delivery of such glorious fantasy. A reminder that we were not always as cynical as popular culture devotees, but for better or worse, we were more naive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The oft-filmed Hope novel receives what is generally considered its best screen treatment. Colman is fine if a bit long in the tooth in the dual roles of a king and a look-alike commoner. Carroll makes a lovely princess. Massey looks ill-at-ease as the king's evil brother while Fairbanks seems to be having a ball playing Massey's rascally henchman. Astor, Smith, and Niven lend able support. Given the romantic buildup between Colman and Carroll, the denouement feels false and anti-climactic. Cromwell's direction tends to be stagy and melodramatic, but he is helped by Howe's fine cinematography and Newman's rousing score. What makes the Hope novel so worthy of being filmed so often?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Having been made in 1937, this is a good movie with a lot of on screen history to watch. David Niven portrays Capt. Fritz Tarlenheim, and is superb. Ronald Colman plays two roles, those of Maj. Rudolf Rassendyll, and that of King Rudolf V. He did an excellent job. Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was excellently cast in this part as was Raymond Massey. You will remember him as Abraham Lincoln. This is a typical story of good and evil, and how one man can change things if his heart is good. Madeleine Carroll portrays Princess Flavia. I would loved to have seen this one in color, I bet she was beautiful. Good movie. I give it a 6 out of a possible 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Swash is (rather) Buckled</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beware - Spoilers Ahead!Not really the triumph it is made out to be, I regret to say.The leads are each at least ten years too old - to make it plausible that Flavia has changed from gawky kid to beautiful woman over the three years since the King last saw her, she should be no more than 20; a non-cradle-snatching Rassendyll in his early 30s, at the most.Flavia cries out for the vulnerable, virginal face and steely inner core of Olivia de Havilland as seen in the following year's ?Robin Hood' of Curtiz. And as her lover, her ?Hood' Errol Flynn would have served much better than Colman (a full 18 years his senior!). Or perhaps Olivier might have been imported for the role. (The roster of Hollywood-acceptable star English actors in the right age range capable of playing the part was pretty short!)Age would not have mattered so much were the film not so devoid of humour (which Carroll had served up in abundance in Hitchcock's ?39 Steps' of 1935, and which she managed again in ?My Favorite Blonde' with Bob Hope in 1942).In the book, as I remember it, Rassendyll is something of a playboy in London; Colman's flirting with Carroll in the carriage ?saluting the crowd' scene is so leaden as to make it seem incredible that he is anything of a ladies' man. (This was, of course, something of a Golden Age of screen flirting, the Breen Office stymieing anything more explicit.)The music - which I had remembered as stirring - turns out to be rather repetitive, there being just the two main themes, the ?national anthem? and the lovers' theme; so that by what should be the crucial final scene between the lovers, one is heartily sick of those soupy strings and, as the price for not hearing them again, almost glad to see the lovers part!That scene (shot by Cukor - in his capacity as ?women's director') is problematic in other respects, as well. The ?look' is different from the rest of the film, and makes the scene seem tacked on. For instance, in the opening master-shot, Carroll starts off wholly back-lit and (therefore in silhouette); then, as Colman bows to her, a light is brought up on her face rather eerily.The exchange (in a combination of two-shots and over-the-shoulder ones), which should be the acme of romance, is stilted in both writing and acting, in the over-melodramatic, silent-influenced style of early 30s talkies. In particular, the transition in Carroll from the wishful thinking of running away with Colman to a recognition of her duty to stay is clunky and unconvincing; as if she were speaking words previously suggested under hypnosis.And when Colman gets on one knee, and Carroll lays her hands on his head - dollying out to a long-shot more or less matching the opening shot of the scene - the whole thing has all but descended into self-parody.Finally, the story must take its share of the blame. It has no pretensions of being a ?procedural' of Central European royal politics, naturally. (For instance, one would expect Flavia to marry not a relative but some foreign prince (for political advantage, and to avoid inbreeding.))But the plotting (in both senses) of the baddies seems particularly threadbare - minimising the ?fish out of water' feelings one should get, especially at a hundred years' remove from the action.And Mary Astor as the ?inside man' is woefully underused - if only for the fact that she has more sex appeal, even when veiled, than the rest of the cast put together.The ending (which is that of the book) is satisfying only as the set-up for a sequel. To deny the expected (Boy gets Girl) outcome is perfectly valid when the denial has an artistic point. (In ?The Third Man', for instance.) Here, without a sequel, it is merely frustrating.A more satisfying ending suggests itself to me (and something like it must have suggested itself to Selznick): the King recognises his unsuitability for the job, and agrees to assume Rassendyll's identity in London, in return for a large annuity. No doubt, he would also receive Rassendyll's ?black book', with the names of the wealthy widows he had been servicing back home. Flavia gets her man, Ruritania its best king in decades, everyone ends up ahead. Perhaps, though, Selznick was leery of pointing up the resemblance of his King Rudolph to the tragically unsuitable King Edward (who by then had abdicated the British throne on account of the most un-Flavia-like Mrs Simpson).</fullReview>

Mary Astor, Ronald Colman and Raymond Massey [as Colman's brother!] are also miscast. The most obvious defect is the editing. I cannot count how many times there are editing mistakes it this movie. The "thrilling" swordfight is also very poorly done. Colman and Fairbanks talk to each other through the whole thing and do not treat each other like enemies at all.
