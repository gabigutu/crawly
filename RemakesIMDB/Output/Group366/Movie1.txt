		<shortDescription>A highly romantic costumed adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When a British subject, Rudolf Rassendyll (Stewart Granger) arrives to Ruritania, in a fishing trip, he was ignoring that he is a replica of the man who would be king...He was also surprised to find out that Rudolf V will be betrayed by two enemies: his half-brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Robert Douglas) who dreams to be the future sovereign, and by the impertinent, ambitious Officer Rupert of Hentzau (James Mason) who wishes to be the first man in the Kingdom...Michael, after drugging the King, wants the Crown to be offered to him by the people... He poses as their savior from the excesses of an incompetent King...But two faithful Officers, Colonel Zapt (Louis Calhern) and Lieutenant Fritz von Tarlenhein (Robert Coote), actively in favor of 'crowning the King,' persuade the 'Englishman on holiday' to substitute the 'twin cousin' and to stand assuming the position of a true king at his Coronation...Rossendyll discovers himself involved in a tensional political web as well as in a strange human sensation...He couldn't play the impostor after meeting Princess Flavia (Deborah Kerr). He couldn't care about the king and the crown anymore... Only her! He instantly falls in love with the young princess... And his love was more than truth or life or honor...Flavia didn't either understand 'why' the King is so different... She never liked the King... She didn't love the King... Why, since the coronation, everything seems so different? Rudolf was so serious, so impartial, so indifferent... Now, so careful, so concerned, so in love...After the success of "Scaramouche," Stewart Granger performs with dignity the king part in "Prisoner of Zenda." He plays with certain charm the innocent hero, the swordsman, the perfect English gentleman in love... He proves to be 'the finest Elphberg of them all.' Granger will be always remembered as the handsome elegant actor of them all...Deborah Kerr, who worked with Granger in "King Solomon's Mines," is exquisite as the delicate, sensitive princess, 'born to her cares and duties.' Her honor lies in keeping faith with her country and her house...Jane Greer plays the French Lady madly in love with Michael... Her only care was 'no harm' to her lover..."The Prisoner of Zenda" has all the elements of a highly romantic costumed adventure: secret plots; confused courts; honor; power; fame; duty; bravery; flirt; passion; love; hate; and swordsplay...Filmed in Technicolor, the film is a beautiful exact remake of the 1937 Version with Ronald Colman, Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Madeleine Carroll and Raymond Massey...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Extravagant Remake of 1937 Classic Nice, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hollywood has always had a philosophy, that if a film makes money, either do a sequel, or remake it! While sequels are most common (offering original cast members, older and less believable in their roles, performing variations of the same plot that made the original film popular...usually less successfully...), remakes have a long history, as well, with some remakes an improvement over the original (John Huston's THE MALTESE FALCON far outshines both of the earlier sound versions), some just as good (1939's BEAU GESTE, with Gary Cooper, has as loyal an audience as Ronald Colman's silent version), and some truly disastrous (why anyone would even CONSIDER remaking Frank Capra's LOST HORIZON, much less turning it into a 70s MUSICAL, defies comprehension!)MGM, in their 1952 remake of 1937's classic THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, tried to surpass the earlier version by creating a 'scene-for-scene' duplicate of the film, while utilizing some of their biggest stars in each role, reworking Alfred Newman's original score, and shooting it all in glorious Technicolor. The end result, however, was a mixed bag...Stewart Granger, MGM's resident 50s swashbuckler, certainly was more athletic than Ronald Colman in the lead, but lacked the older actor's panache, and more importantly, 'The Voice', that distinctive, oft-imitated but never duplicated speaking voice that made Colman so unique. It still wins hearts, nearly 50 years after his death, and was the reason Colman made the transition from a star of silent pictures to sound so effortlessly. While Deborah Kerr was as regally beautiful as Madeleine Carroll, she lacked the fragile quality that made Carroll's doomed love of the commoner Colman so heartbreaking. Louis Calhern, in C. Aubrey Smith's role, as Col. Zapt? No way! Robert Coote replacing David Niven as Fritz had some novelty value, as both would costar, twelve years later, in the television series, THE ROGUES, but the younger Niven was far more appropriate in the role of a young but loyal assistant to Zapt. While Robert Douglas was every bit as sinister as Raymond Massey as Black Michael, the most disastrous miscasting came with the film's other major villain, Rupert of Hentzau. While James Mason was a truly gifted actor, he was too old, and actually too villainous in the role! While the character has to be truly jaded and unscrupulous, he also has to be such a young, likable scoundrel that his escape, after the climactic duel, disappoints no one, not even the hero he nearly defeats. The role ideally suited Douglas Fairbanks Jr., whose prowess with a sword was unmatched, and whose scenes with Colman were instant classics of sophisticated wit. When Granger and Mason repeated the same lines, their exchanges came across as typical 'good guy vs. bad guy' dialog, lacking the unique chemistry Colman and Fairbanks brought to the roles.As for shooting the film in Technicolor...While the regal color photography certainly made the Palace scenes more impressive (don't forget, Great Britain was crowning Elizabeth as Queen when the remake was released, and American audiences were rabid Anglophiles, totally enthralled by all the Pomp and Circumstance), it also 'dated' the story, making the adventure seem quaint and old-fashioned in the Cold War era. The black-and-white photography of 1937, with it's masterful use of light and shadow, gave the earlier version a timeless quality it still carries to this day.David Niven, in his autobiography ('The Moon's a Balloon'), said he thought MGM's remake was a ridiculous idea, and that he was pleased that the newer production, even as a scene-for-scene copy, failed. While I think he was, perhaps, too hard on the Granger film, I have to agree that no other version has ever even come close to the magic of Ronald Colman's 1937 classic!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Film is a Blast!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Knowing nothing of this film, the book or previous versions, I watched TPOZ expecting nothing but a star-studded cast. I sat enchanted throughout, undisturbed by thoughts of "carbon copy" scenes, recycled musical scores and previous performances. For me the movie was timeless, not a word nor scene wasted, Granger and Kerr were engaging lovers. The sword fight was one of the best. The only "glaring" production fault was the 300 watt shadow. Otherwise, fantastic cinematography and score, and wonderful Granger, Kerr and Mason.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old mythology that works, for a change</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The old swashbuckling mythology in capital letters: King, Country, Duty, Courage, and Honor, featuring a handsome, fearless Hero; a beautiful and perfectly behaved Princess; a stalwart Elderly Advisor; a grasping Villain; his insinuating Right Hand; and so on. It's so stereotyped that it could take up a whole chapter of Carl Jung.So it's amazing that this production manages to pull it off so well. Maybe it's the unusually effective screenplay, which doesn't waste a line, and somehow manages not to rehash creaky dialogue. Maybe it's the actors, who carry their roles with as much dignity as if this is the first time anyone's ever done them. Or maybe it's James Mason as the only recognizable human in the story, a charming and calculating psychopath with razor-sharp wit and stunning powers of manipulation.However they did it, the results are a joy. Swordplay, love affairs, grand balls, royalty, and political intrigue - it all works. Put your brain in low gear, sit back, and enjoy the ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I like this version more.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I bought a duel set of "The Prisoner of Zenda" that contains both 1937 and 1952 versions, and like the 1952 version much more. First of all, Granger's handsomeness and style fits more to the fairy-tale adventure story of prince and princess, Coleman is too sophisticated for the Rassendyall character. Other casts are better also; Kerr is much prettier and princess like, and Mason is a more impressive villain. I also think that the fighting scenes are better, more elegant and better choreographed. With no less significance is the color ,makes the costume and characters look more sensational, and gives more feeling for the romantic fairy tale .This movie is pure entertainment, I first saw it in high school, loved it, I still enjoy it 30 years later .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A colourful but superfluous remake of the 1937 adventure classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'The Prisoner of Zenda' (1952) is a remake - using the same shooting script, which was in turn adapted from the 1890s stage-play - of the 1937 Ronald Colman/Douglas Fairbanks jr version. While the colour photography makes quite an impact, especially with the costumes, sadly Stewart Granger is not in the Colman league in the dual role of Rudolf Rassendyll and Rudolf V. In fact, the film seems as unnecessary as the recent remake of 'Psycho' - Yes, it's in colour, but with a less interesting cast than the original, so why bother? There was scope for a new film based on Hope's novel, but it needed to be opened out more, with greater development of some of the subordinate characters (always a problem in filming a story written in the first-person). Stewart Granger was one of the better of the later generation of swashbuckling stars, but somehow he lacks Colman's dignity as Rassendyll. Deborah Kerr at least has the merit of having the 'Elphberg red' hair (which the hero too should have!), and does well enough as the highly idealised Princess Flavia. Much as I generally like James Mason, he's no substitute for Douglas Fairbanks jr. Although he brings out the underlying viciousness of Rupert von Hentzau more effectively than Fairbanks did, he is too old and rather too austere for the role. Hentzau's deep malevolence is far more disturbing coming from what appears to be a flippant and charming boy in his very early 20s. Mason could have been a *wonderful* Duke Michael, although here - as per the 1937 version - that character was still under-written, and again cast too old (Robert Douglas). Probably the most successful piece of casting in this version is Jane Greer as Antoinette de Mauban, the French courtesan who has attached herself to Michael. As in 1937 (with Mary Astor), an actress best known for her 'film noir' roles is ideal in this part, because Antoinette *is* in many respects an enigmatic, double-crossing 'noir' dame in 19C costume, who must choose whether to betray her lover in order to save him. Whose side is she really on? - It's a great, ultimately tragic sub-plot, which could have been given more weight as a counterpoint to the bittersweet Rassendyll-Flavia romance - but the antique 1890s-1930s script throws it away. In conclusion: while this film gains some visual charm from the use of colour, the 1937 version has the more memorable performances; but neither quite lives up to the expectations in my imagination, fuelled by the books with their Charles Gibson plates.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a wonderfully adventurous romp! Granger is at his best in this type of role! Handsome and daring, he fills all romantic girl dreams of period heros. Deborah Kerr and Stewart Granger have great chemistry and are obviously having fun. The story line is that the King has been kidnapped and a British man who looks exactly like the King has to step in and take his place, to keep the government under control. He however, falls in love with the King's cousin, who is also the King's betrothed. The rest you must see, it is a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can never watch too many of these movies. The story was beautiful, but not overdone. Stewart Granger gives a great performance, and we get the added bonus of another stellar performance by James Mason. Of course, the breathtaking (Dame) Deborah Kerr is the real reason to watch -- and wonder how an actress can be so beautiful *and* so talented. My only regret is that she wasn't more prominent in the story. And, as usual, she doesn't get the man. Oh well. The cinematography, the costumes, the action -- all blend perfectly with the compelling story and the great acting to make this a "must see" movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Average Technicolor remake of a 1937 classic...the fight scenes are a big improvement here...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1937 film version, produced by David Selznick and starring Ronald Colman as Rudolf Rassendyll/King Rudolf V, Madeline Carroll as Princess Flavia, and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as the villainous Rupert of Hentzau, is an escapist fantasy adventure classic in many respects. It's one of my all-time favorite stories and one of my favorite films to enjoy whenever I'm bored. Besides, the film inspired me to create written adventures of my own imaginary European country as a high school student.Many years later the MGM studios decided to produce a Technicolor remake of the 1937 film. In few elements, such as in the production values and action scenes, it's an improvement. In most elements it's not.Here we have a scene-for-scene remake that's virtually identical (even in the camera angles, dialog, and stirring music score by Alfred Newman) to the 1937 film except for the casting. And the casting is the weakest flaw here. Apart from Jane Greer in the Mary Astor role, we have Stewart Granger who has the required athleticism but lacks Ronald Colman's urbane panache in order to act regal. Deborah Kerr's Princess Flavia is a one-dimensional character here. The love scenes and chemistry between Granger and Kerr seems forced and unconvincing. The suave James Mason lacks Douglas Fairbank's young, devilish charm as Rupert of Hentzau, which made Fairbanks so enjoyable to watch in the 1937 version. The supporting characters, Colonel Zapt (Louis Calhern) and Fritz (Robert Coote), are reduced to mere puppets here and lack the buddy charm that C. Aubrey Smith and David Niven contained in the 1937 version.Even worse, MGM contract director Richard Thorpe captained the film. Being an average director who always relied on shooting as few takes as possible and caring little for artistic temperament or actors' performances, his vast film work was only average and mostly unsatisfactory. He was never one of my favorite classic film directors.However, it is the magnificent Technicolor production design, as well as the improved final duel between Rassendyll and Rupert, that makes the remake worth watching. Thanks to the bright lighting required for shooting in Technicolor, the night scenes are easier to watch this time. Even better, the exciting final duel is much more elaborately and imaginatively staged this time, while the two opponents in the 1937 version only looked as if they were fencing someone off-camera in close-ups and relying on stunt men in their long shots. Next to THE ADVENTURES OF ROBIN HOOD (1938) THE MARK OF ZORRO (1940), and THE SEA HAWK (1940), this one ranks as one of my favorite film duels. However, despite the extravagant settings, the period look goes a little too far...the men smoke ladies' cigarettes and in two scenes Granger wears the most effeminate fur overcoat I've ever seen! A beautiful Technicolor production and an awesome duel scene within...but after watching this version it's like you've just ate a slice of French silk chocolate pie, which is rich and filling but lacks the substance and nutritional value of a healthier dark chocolate bar.Stick to the 1937 version, please.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seems to me that if you're going to do a re-make of an earlier film, you need to have a better approach than just to refilm it, scene-by-scene, from its immediate predecessor.Watching this 1952 version of "The Prisoner of Zenda," it emerges an astonishing "carbon copy" of its 15-year-old vintage model, only with different actors and in color.What was most surprising was using Alfred Newman's 1937 music almost note-for-note. Conrad Salinger, MGM arranger-orchestrator-composer, seemed to have merely pulled out the old score, dusted off the parts, and passed them out to the MGM Orchestra to re-record.Since this was also the music used for the now historic early December '39 sneak-preview of "Gone With the Wind" (outside of Los Angeles prior to its premiere before Max Steiner finished his work) it's even more strange to hear it here.While the '52 cast was talented and the production values intact, there were no particularly fresh insights or viewpoints offered here, resulting in an efficiently "cloned" confection.Less that an auspicious feather in MGM's cinematic folio, it still probably went over well with a new "generation" unfamiliar with either the '37 film or the original novel. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something short of greatness</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the face of it, "The Prisoner of Zenda" has everything a swashbuckler could require to make it a glorious success: a star-studded cast with previous form, Technicolour pageantry, MGM production values, an Alfred Newman score, a classic story of self-sacrificing heroism... not to mention a setting that's not only generically but genuinely Ruritanian! But on viewing it again after a lapse of some years, I find that it still doesn't work for me; and there doesn't seem to be any obvious reason why.There were in fact *two* films released in 1952 starring Stewart Granger in sword-fighting heroics: one of them -- enchanting, bittersweet, dancing of wit and of blade, and featuring what was to become one of the most famous fight sequences in screen history -- was, of course, "Scaramouche". The other was "The Prisoner of Zenda"... and somehow, in every aspect that melded together to produce the classic that was its counterpart, it never quite catches up. Swashbucklers should spring lightly; this one has gloss, but a certain stilted air.Stewart Granger differentiates his dual roles admirably, to the extent that I caught myself becoming sceptical as to the actual resemblance between the two supposed doubles! His final duel is as athletic as any in his screen career, although the plot demands dogged defence rather than flashing brilliance; indeed, the outcome is refreshingly unconventional. However, I didn't find Rudolf Rassendyll to be one of his more memorable characters.It was James Mason, sporting an incongruous Prussian bullet-head haircut, who was the real disappointment for me. No stranger to charismatic villainy in the likes of "The Man in Grey", "Fanny by Gaslight" or "The Wicked Lady", he is here oddly lacking in Rupert of Hentzau's essential perverse charm, in what should have been a scene-stealing part. The other male characters are little more than one-dimensional down to Duke Michael's villainous limp, although Louis Calhern makes an upright Colonel Zapt.The women fare better. Deborah Kerr is sweet, fiery and entirely convincing as Princess Flavia, next in line to the throne, and Jane Greer is more than equal to the pivotal role of Antoinette de Mauban, whose complex motives prove the key to the whole plot.Ultimately, I found this a decent film, but not as outstanding as it should have been, given its constituent parts. It isn't the best work of any of the actors involved. I am reminded of Zoltan Korda's re-make of his own "Four Feathers" as the widescreen "Storm of the Nile": the story (and indeed in that case the script) is the same, but the spark is missing.Given the parallels, I must admit that I'm now very curious as to how the 1937 "Prisoner of Zenda" -- which I've never seen -- stands up in comparison! This one is a plush literary adaptation, but lacks the rollicking rapier-edge of laughter and daring that characterise the great classics of its genre.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Colorful but lesser Ruritania</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Stewart Granger - Deborah Kerr movie version of Anthony Hope's THE PRISONER OF ZENDA is an entertaining film, but it comes off second best to it's 1937 predecessor with Ronald Colman and Madeleine Carroll. The fact that the film was in Technicolor (Colman's was in black and white) is odd but possibly part of the reason for the slightly lesser result. All of the performers in the 1952 version did very good work that was comparable to the work that the previous cast did. Yet the later film is not quite as good.According to the Turner Classic Movie's Stewart Granger was at a dinner at Ronald Colman's house where they ran the 1937 film as entertainment. Granger liked the film and convinced MGM to do a remake. The film was like a scene by scene remake - with a small screen set up showing the original film for the cast to review when they did their scenes. The only changes was the production crew, the cast and the color film stock.Granger comes off as good as Rudolf Rassendyl and King Rudolf V, but he is a trifle self conscious. When Colman played the part he had a great lightness of touch that helped color his performance (particularly when dealing with both Douglas Fairbanks Jr. as Rupert of Hentzau and Raymond Massey as Black Michael). Granger tries to copy this but it seems a little forced. It's odd because he had an advantage over Colman regarding the cast - Rupert in the 1952 film was played by James Mason, who had already appeared in two films (as deadly adversary) to Granger (THE MAN IN GRAY and FANNY BY GASLIGHT). Colman never appeared opposite Fairbanks in any previous movie to their version of THE PRISONER. As a result there is a screen chemistry between Granger and Mason, but it doesn't translate to a better pair of performances. Some critics point out that Mason seems to old for Rupert, but except for being called "Young Hentzau" by Colonel Sapt (Louis Calhern) there is nothing to suggest he is in his early 20s. However, Fairbanks was leaner in appearance than Mason, so that his youthful qualities did shine through while Mason's just did not do so.The part of Michael is handled by Robert Douglas as though he is just jealous of his half-brother's luck of birth. Yet he is shown with one thing that Raymond Massey's performance did not have - Massey was not crippled. Douglas constantly walks with a cane, which suggests a physical weakness that is a mirror to his emotional one. But it's too little, and it is never really developed.Deborah Kerr's Flavia is appealing (any performance of Kerr's is appealing) but Madeleine Carroll was able to get the jolt of that sense of duty that prevents Rassendyl and Flavia from leaving at the end - Kerr seems to be just repeating her lines by rote in their last scene. Mary Astor and Jane Greer both were equally affective as Michael's mistress, as were C. Aubrey Smith and Louis Calhern as Sapt (Calhern was able to give a devilish twist to the Colonel at one point when commenting on a hidden passage in the royal palace at Streslau which was useful for protecting royal reputations). David Niven and Robert Coote were Fritz von Tarkeheim in the two versions, and both played the role effectively but not remarkably.The color was useful in the 1952 film in making the sets more evocative of that period from 1890 to 1897 (Victoria's upcoming Jubilee is mentioned at one point). But it only goes so far - it just reminds us that the characters are in a realistic setting. But the story is such romantic fluff that the realism seems unimportant. In short the 1952 film is really good, but the earlier one is nearly perfect in comparison. I still would stick to Colman's version than Granger's. As for the 1979 Peter Seller's spoof, or the 1975 Malcolm MacDowell "George Macdonald Fraser's" ROYAL FLASH, or the 1965 partial spoof in the Blake Edwards' THE GREAT RACE, they are in a special class as they are not serious remakes but done for laughs mostly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Constitutional Crisis In Ruritania</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Next to the 1937 version with Ronald Colman and Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., this version of The Prisoner Of Zenda is the one most fondly remembered by movie audiences. If it doesn't quite have the panache of the Colman film, it makes up for it with the introduction of some nice color cinematography.The casting of Stewart Granger in the double role of Rudolph Rassendyll and his royal cousin, the Crown Prince Rudolph of Ruritania and James Mason as the villainous Rupert of Hentzau is hardly some stock company casting. If Granger doesn't quite have Colman's flair for the spoken word and very few ever have, he makes a fine and dashing hero which parts he played very well, too well in his opinion on his career. As for Mason, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. took the Rupert part because he was advised it's one of the best villains ever created in drama. Mason who has also played some of the best villains on screen keeps up the fine tradition for that role.The 1937 version benefited from having the world wide publicity of the constitutional crisis in the United Kingdom over Edward VIII choice of consort. I've wondered whether someone over at MGM after George VI died in early 1952 whether they thought it was now time to do another remake of The Prisoner Of Zenda in time to coincide with the publicity of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation. Which begs the question whether we'll get yet another version when Prince Charles eventually assumes the throne. We've seen over ten versions so far going back to the silent screen.The women in the cast, Deborah Kerr and Jane Greer as Princess Flavia and Antoinette DeMauban respectively never come in for much discussion of their roles. The parts in relation to the hero are almost a carbon copy of the roles of Katharine DeVaucelles and Hugette from If I Were King. I've always thought that Greer as Antoinette plays one of the most tragic characters in popular literature. She loves a cold and forbidding man in Prince Michael, especially when played by Robert Douglas. But he's her man and when she does ever so slightly give in to the scheming Hentzau she regrets it when it means the death of her beloved. Personally why she falls for a cold fish that Michael is who can figure. But the heart does have its reasons.As for Kerr her best scene is at the end when she realizes she has been hoodwinked, but in a scheme for the greater good of the kingdom. She knows what her obligations are and she too can't afford to follow her heart.Something tells me we're far from done with The Prisoner Of Zenda. Try and figure out who could play these roles today with the flair of the players in this version, let alone the one from 1937.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stewart Granger duels James Mason</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"He has the appearance and manner of the king, yet he's really a lookalike? and on his shoulders rests all hope of foiling a blackguard's plot to usurp the throne. Adventure, pageantry and royal intrigue are forged at sword point in the two finest screen versions of the beloved 1894 novel filmed many times," according to the Warner Home Video release, "Ronald Colman plays the double role in the resilient 1937 David O. Selznick production (Side A), making palpable the heartbreak of the royal stand-in whose gallantry is tested by his love for the real king's fiancée (Madeleine Carroll). Stewart Granger stars in the eye-filling 1952 color version (Side B), romancing Deborah Kerr and wielding bold steel in the film's bravura climactic duel." Thanks to whoever at Warner/Turner decided to release these two versions of "The Prisoner of Zenda" together. Considering the way things are usually handled in Hollywood, the obvious has become inspired. Adding extra movies, for less than the price of two (or more), also encourages sales. They could have added "The Prisoner of Zenda" (1922) for even better measure, assuming the three "Metro" features are owned by Warner Bros. Of the two available here, the 1937 "black-and-white" version wins the sword fight, though the 1952 color version is inoffensive and beautifully photographed (by Joseph Ruttenberg).Examined together, the three films support the widely held belief that the more villainous role in a drama is often the one to act. In this case, observe how the character "Rupert of Hentzau" supports this thesis. In the 1927 version, the role made Ramon Novarro a star. In the 1937 and 1952 versions, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and James Mason are always above or equal to anyone else in the cast. The fact that Mr. Colman can his own against Mr. Fairbanks helps make their version a classic. Lewis Stone appears in two versions, and Louis Calhern played the lead on stage. In each case, "The Prisoner of Zenda" is an attractive production.****** The Prisoner of Zenda (11/4/52) Richard Thorpe ~ Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr, James Mason, Louis Calhern</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colourful and entertaining version of the Ruritarian romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This pales I think to the brilliant 1937 film, but this version is still very good. It is a little too short though and some of the exchanges of the dialogue lack the class and unique chemistry of the 1937 film. However, the colour, costumes and scenery are exquisite and the score is marvellous. The film goes at a good pace too and the romantic and exciting story never fails to engage, while the acting in general is very good. Stewart Granger is marvellous in his dashing and heroic dual role, and Deborah Kerr is ravishing as Princess Flavia. Jane Greer comes off even better, while James Mason is a menacing and somewhat austere Rupert and while his part is a little underwritten perhaps Robert Douglas is appropriately sinister as Michael. Overall, far from perfect, but worthy and colourful version. 8/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The prisoner of Zenda" (1952) is a wonderful swashbuckler ,a movie the whole family can enjoy! I've already seen it three or four times and I've never got tired of it.Stewart Granger is absolutely perfect as the hero,playing two parts with gusto:I love the crowning where he manages to be as majestic as a king and yet shows he is not completely at ease ;his waltz with Deborah Kerr is also a great moment.James Mason vies with Robert Douglas in wickedness ,greed and Machiavelism.Deborah Kerr is gorgeous as Princess Flavia.This kind of story belongs to an imaginary remote past -although it is supposed to happen in 1897-like the fairy tales.That's why "the prisoner" is so magical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Marvellous matinée swashbuckler</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Rollicking Technicolor swashbuckler like they just don't, can't or probably just won't make anymore. You just know that today the story here would be swallowed up in miles of SFX ("National Treasure" anyone?). Virtually the only noticeable effect here is the cleverly wrought double-play scenes of Grainger as the facile sot of a king and his dashing True-Brit doppel-ganger who is pressed into his impersonation (you really can't see the join). Grainger of course eventually saves the kingdom against the dastardly machinations of the King's designing brother, Prince Michael and the even more dangerous James Mason, (a picture in lilac jodhpurs!) as the real brains and cold-steel of the whole operation, Rupert of Hentzau. Here we get a narrative true to its "Boy's Own Story" novel source which plays it straight from start to finish. The story engages and involves the viewer straightaway and takes you out of the everyday into a magical make-believe world of derring-do (and derring don'ts!). The three English leads (Grainger, Mason and Kerr) are all absolutely delightful, immersed as far as they need to be in their characters with nary a trace of knowing cynicism at the unreality of it all. The climax of the film of course is the terrific sword-fight between Grainger and Mason (more correctly the two gifted stunt-players), a trick repeated in Grainger's next feature "Scaramouche" to even better effect. All in all a matinée treat of the highest order.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well it's a lot more colorful than the more familiar 1937 version, mainly because it's shot in Technicolor. Otherwise it's an almost shot-for-shot remake. If there were any changes in the dialog they slipped past the transcendental unity of my apperception.So if the story is the same, and the dialog is the same, and the direction is almost the same, where are the differences between the 1937 and the 1954 versions? There are some slight differences in the staging and direction. The most notable is in the climactic sabre duel between James Mason as Rupert and Stewart Granger as Rudolf. This one lasts longer and is better staged. More use is made of furniture and there are more dramatic touches. And the wardrobe in this scene is a bit more splashy in the case of Stewart's character. Here he wears a rather dashing dark blue outfit accented by a designer silver dagger at his hip. In the earlier version poor Ronald Coleman was stuffed into a homely and somewhat raggedy looking woolen turtleneck sweater.And the principle parts are played by different actors and actresses so there are additional variations on the theme of intrigue, action, and love in Ruritania. Jane Greer is comelier than Mary Astor was. Robert Douglas is a sneering villain, much like Raymond Massey, his predecessor, but brings less character to the role. Douglas simply can't sneer with such complete contempt as Massey did, but then hardly anybody could. Deborah Kerr perhaps wins by a nose over Madeleine Carrol in the part of Flavia. She looks just fine and is appealingly breathless and helpless whereas Carrol, though beautiful, played her stock part as if it were a stock part. A man might love her and want to ravish her but he would also want to protect Kerr. The guy playing Fritz is without distinction while David Niven in 1937 was a memorable sidekick.Stewart Granger seemed to be stuck in Errol Flynn's pictures in Hollywood, as he is here, and doesn't have a chance to invest much of his considerable talent in the role of the play actor. And although he maintains an amused distance from the proceedings he isn't full of gaiety and doesn't chuckle so often as Ronald Coleman did. His tall, solid, muscular figure does suggest a man more suited to physical action than Coleman.I enjoyed James Mason as the sardonic villain. He's got the same lines as Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., in the 1937 version but he gives them a very different twist. Fairbanks was all smiles, laughter, devil-may-care, reckless. Mason's every sentence begins with a high contemptuous whine -- awwwmmmm. He still smiles a lot, but it's an evil calculating smile, as if he truly believes he sees through all the social ritual and is able to read the dark and dreadful desires in each human soul. And, as in earlier versions, he's given by far the most engaging lines. When he tells Robert Douglas that the real king has been replaced by a ringer, he adds that it may be hard to believe that two people could look so much alike, "But I knew twin sisters once who -- but that's another story." Fairbanks was like a child misbehaving. Mason is like a supercilious snob.I enjoyed it as much as I did the 1937 version and I suppose many others did too. Santa Maria, the hoary story has been remade so many times that we have to wonder if it's not time for still another rendition to be trotted out. Perhaps its announcement has been delayed because no one is able to figure out exactly how to fit a car chase and an exploding fireball into a story set in Mitteleuropa in 1903. Maybe they can update it. Instead of being a REAL king, somebody can play the King of the White House. And they can change the title to, "The Prisoner of Karl Rove."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Englishman vacationing in a Ruritarian kingdom is recruited to impersonate his cousin, the soon-to-be-crowned king when the monarch is drugged and kidnapped.This version of "The Prisoner of Zenda" used the same shooting script as the 1937 David O. Selznick film directed by John Cromwell and starring Ronald Colman and Madeleine Carroll. Slight variations in the screenplay were added by Noel Langley. In addition to the dialogue, the same film score, composed by Alfred Newman for the 1937 version, was also used for this version. A comparison of the two films reveals that settings and camera angles, in most cases, are the same.Now, the consensus is that the 1937 version is the superior and definitive version. Typically, I agree with critics and tend to think older versions of films are generally better (though not always). On this one, though, I simply found the remake more engaging. The lead was more persuasive and I think there was just more emotion conveyed. It was more passionate than the original and this kept me far more interested.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1937 Prisoner of Zenda is a classic if there ever was one: perfectly cast, acted with zest, with admirable sets, costumes and cinematography, this story of Central European aristocratic intrigue is one of the great triumphs of Hollywood romantic swashbucklers. This is a film that everyone of every age will find delightful.Unfortunately, this wonderful movie is ill served by the Warners DVD set (which also includes the inferior 1953 remake), which uses a poor transfer of a poor print. Five stars for the movie certainly, and since this seems to be the only region 1 DVD available, you might as well watch it; it's better than not seeing the film at all. But this film cries out for a properly remastered DVD made from a good archival print, to which I'd certainly give five stars. The set also includes some shorts and cartoons which are interesting as period pieces.</fullReview>

After all, the story is wonderful and the actors are quite good. The problem for me is that although this is a lovely film, it's also completely unnecessary, as the 1937 film version was nearly perfect. Ronald Colman was perfect in the lead and his supporting cast (including C. Aubrey Smith, David Niven, Douglas Fairbanks Jr. and Raymond Massey) were perfectly cast as well. Here, Stewart Granger and James Mason (among others) were good but at no point did they make me prefer this over the classic 1937 version. My advice is to just see this earlier film. Other than being in black &amp; white, it's better in every way.</fullReview>

If you have an ounce of noble feeling in you, you really need to watch this, and wallow in the highest of sentiments.James Mason gave one of the best performances as the villainous Rupert von Hentzau. Both Stewart Granger and Deborah Kerr are almost impossibly beautiful and impossibly noble as lovers for whom Duty will always be more important than Love. How very refreshing!

		<shortDescription>Has elements Shakespeare's play; Richard III</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This adaptation of The Prisoner Of Zender has Stewart Grainger playing European King Rudolf V at Strelsau who is the constitutional head of a version of a feudalistic system. In order to retain this version of a European feudal system, then it is crucial for King Rudolfe to be crowned. But like some kings (for example Great Britain's Edward VII, -9 November 1841 ? 6 May 1910)he leads a merry and decadent life of irresponsibility. This makes him vulnerable and as such rife for usurping by his half brother Michael, Duke of Strelsau (Robert Douglass). But Michael's threat to the the crown lays in his courtier, the villain Rupert of Hentzau (James Mason)who seeks glory and power for himself via Michael as opposed for the latter.Therefore the threat to the crown and the feudalistic system in this film is that of a republican nature in that Rupert of Hentzau has desires of power. In this respect the fairytale-like plot is not too far from what is interpreted as reality by the British press. To further explain, some sectors of the British press would have former British Prime Minister Tony Blair as a one time pretender to the crown. This ambition is interpreted as being dangerous for the people in the form of Rupert of Hentzau in The Prisoner Of Zender.Elements of William Shakespeare's ( some say, propaganda) play, Richard III are found in The Prisoner of Zender. Like Richard III, the Prisoner Of Zender illustrates a fragile monarchy, and the feudal system which buttresses it destabilised by a treacherous half brother. As the film illustrates, the feudal system is bound by the loyalty of an aristocracy which in turn is furnished with a privileged lifestyle. This is illustrated by Princess Favia (Deborah Kerr) who isn't willing to give such a privileged lifestyle up. Such a privileged lifestyle comes to define the meaning of national patriotism that binds its subjects (the people) to. With the nobility defining patriotism then all who disagree with them are disloyal, traitors and usurpers as seen in Rupert of Hentzau.Indeed, Rupert of Hentzau is keen to break the feudalistic system as witnessed in the swashbuckling sword-fencing scene where he defies the rules of play. This prominent scene is one of the best in the film. Where Grainger is urbane, and charming in his style of acting his duel role, Mason is the scene stealer. The latter's acting is first rate, and it never lets up. Another prominent actor in The Prisoner Of Zender is Jane Greer who plays Antoinette de Mauban with conviction.The Technicolour of the film reflects and captures the ostentatiousness of a regal lifestyle, here directed by alleged budget conscious Richard Thorpe. Moreover, the Technicolour brings the film to life and adds to its fairytale-like appeal. This makes the film a feast for the eyes.In sum this film is on the surface superficial, but beneath its Technicolour, movie star glamour it is a Shakespereanesque tale of political intrigue!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless tale of adventure and romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on the novel of Anthony Hope, it was a tale of mistaken identity, leading to adventure, romance, and unrequited love. Stewart Granger played the title characters, a tourist who resembled the king of a fictional country, and was recruited to spoil a plot by the brother of the king to take over the throne and a fair princess, played by the beautiful Deborah Kerr. James Mason played the young henchman of the villain (who eventually sought revenge in the sequel to the novel, aptly named "Rupert of Hentzau". I have often wondered why the sequel had not been made into a movie also). It is an old-fashioned tale which probably won't stand up to the modern criterion of credibility, yet touches on old-time values of integrity and honour. As one might have guessed, romance ignited between the "imposter" and the fair princess. In the end, the young lovers took the high road as the movie ends in a heartbreaking farewell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While on holiday an Englishman who resembles the king of a small European nation gets mixed up in palace intrigue and royal romance when his royal doppelgänger is kidnapped.A Technicolor remake of Anthony Hope's much filmed story sees Stewart Granger, Deborah Kerr and James Mason star, while directing is Richard Thorpe, composing the score is Alfred Newman and cinematography is by Joseph Ruttenberg.Lush and at times lavish, this MGM production is however rather ponderous at times. The first hour positively crawls and while Granger is just fine in the dual roles of Rudolf Rassendyl/King Rudolf V, the dynamism and breezy pace of the Ronald Colman starring 1937 version is sadly lacking. A better director than Richard "One Take Only" Thorpe could have made better use of the budget. There's also a distinct lack originality in the piece since it's practically the same film as the 37 movie. Even using the same Newman score. You have to wonder what was the point really?Still, there are some enjoyable moments in here to not make it a complete waste of time. James Mason, in spite of it being a rare occasion where he's miscast, is worth a watch for his line in campy villainy. While Ruttenberg's camera-work doesn't waste the chance to swash that buckle in a Technicolor sheen. The duelling sequence, that sadly seems to take forever to arrive, is well choreographed (better than anything in the 37 movie actually), and the costumes by Walter Plunkett are very pleasing on the eye. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colorful Remake of a Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Richard Thorpe's vigorous remake of the 1937 "Prisoner of Zenda, itself a remake of the 1922 silent "Prisoner of Zenda," boasts one major advantage over the classic Ronald Colman version, namely, four-time Oscar winning cinematographer Joseph Ruttenberg's dazzling Technicolor photography. Costume movies are the rare exception to the rule when it comes to color. They always look better in color. Stewart Granger is suitably heroic as the swashbuckling protagonist, and he seems more ideally cast as a leaping and lunging swordsman than Colman. Nothing against Ronald Colman but he seemed a little too old to be playing an athletic protagonist in the spirt of either Douglas Fairbanks, Sir., or Errol Flynn. Meanwhile, James Mason--incredibly enough--doesn't overshadow Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., in the role of amoral Rupert. Mind you, Mason later became a bigger star than both Granger and Fairbanks, but he seems more thuggish. Louis Calhern is just as good as C. Aubrey Smith, but Robert Douglas pales by comparison with Raymond Massey as Michael, Duke of Strelsau. Aside from these quibbles, this "Prisoner of Zenda" is essentially a scene-for-scene remake, with some variation incorporated in Thorpe's use of camera set-ups and pacing. If you see this version before you watch the 1937 version, you may prefer it simply because of the vibrant Technicolor. Deborah Kerr is definitely an asset as the Princess Flavia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid story, solid cast, colourful looks but, other than Mason, not a lot of fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Englishman Rudolf Rassendyll travels to see his distant relative King Rudolf V. When he arrives in the country he gets some funny looks and, when he meets King Rudolf he understands why ? they are the total spit of one another, apart from a moustache. The two men spend all night drinking, a habit King Rudolf is oft to entertain but Rassendyll is a light weight and has fallen asleep long before the final bottles are opened. The next morning he wakes up with a sore head but the King is out for the count for much longer due to a drugged bottle of wine ? the work of his brother Michael, who seeks to claim the throne in the chaos that he hopes will follow the cancellation of the day's coronation. Rassendyll steps into the place of the King in a cunning ploy to keep the country steady; however he finds himself in the midst of a much more serious ploy than drugged wine.Despite the fact that it has been made many times, I must confess to this being the first time I've seen this story told. I must also confess that for the most part I found it quite dull. On paper I can see how fascinating it could have been because it has political intrigue, betrayals, sword fights and action. However the film opens with a sort of criss-cross humour that didn't really engage me at all. It wasn't funny and it seemed to undercut the serious business of telling a good yarn. Things get a bit better once the villains turn up but even then I was surprised by how plodding it was all delivered. The final scenes were pretty good and it was a welcome arrival for sword fighting in a very talky film but I did wish there had been a bit more swagger to the rest of the film, if not actually action.The cast are reasonably good. Granger does well but his sudden transformation from innocent abroad into action hero at the end was a gear change too much. Kerr is pretty but mostly pretty bland. Calhern is solid and Greer was a strange find. I liked Douglas but it was Mason who dominated the film. He seems a bit out of place but he has some great lines and generally he looks like he is having fun and not taking any of it too seriously. He is a breath of fresh air among the rest of the stiff material and he stole every scene he was in.A good story then but delivered in a rather flat and dull fashion that put me off early on and never really got me back. It all looks good in glorious Technicolor but other than that the only other thing that kept me with it was a delicious little turn from Mason, who at least has the good taste to have a bit of fun ? something that I had hoped to do myself but sadly did not.</fullReview>

But it is just not possible with the shallow acting here and the dragging plot. It sinks into being just a B movie schmaltz story instead of the exciting adventure it should have been. BUt here everything from plot to actors to set decoration is like watching a rouged up corpse at a wake.

The other cast members go through their paces in acceptable fashion, but their actions are just not that very exciting.

		<fullReview>MGM's 1952 version of The Prisoner of Zenda is often dismissed as a shot-for-shot remake with nothing added but Technicolor, but while it does often closely follow the blueprint of the excellent 1937 Ronald Colman version it also improves on the screenplay to a surprising degree thanks to Noel Langley's script polish while offering at least one better action sequence. Rupert of Hentzau always had the best lines, but with James Mason in the part, the role is considerably expanded to particularly good effect, with Mason making the most of the charismatic villainy even if there's some rather obvious stunt doubling for him in the final swordfight. There's even the addition of a second scene between Stewart Granger's player king and Mason's charmingly untrustworthy rogue as befits Mason's star status, with Mason winning on points despite having the more ridiculous hairstyle. Not that Granger is any slouch here himself, at the height of his powers in the dual lead role and even allowing the real king a bit more dignity than usual too (though look out for the moment where Granger inadvertently reveals he's a pipe man offscreen when he has to light a cigarette!). While Louis Calhern isn't quite up to C. Aubrey Smith in the original as Colonel Zapt, the always likable Robert Coote outshines David Niven in the earlier film as Fritz and Deborah Kerr makes for an excellent leading lady.

There's a lot to be said for the simple authenticity of non CGI movies with Romantic themes.Michael is deliciously dastardly, the uniforms are quaint yet hold a sense of menace, and in particular Deborah Kerr's performance really is underrated and very well done. I think it's a tribute to the original story that it has been remade so many times. Its universal themes offer something for each of us: duty and lost love, the danger of greed, and a reminder of chivalry from 19th century Europe, whatever its paternalistic and hierarchical undertones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Looks like an MGM Technicolor fairy-tale for adults...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If production values were all that mattered, this would be considered a vast improvement over the B&amp;W version with Ronald Colman and Madeleine Carroll. MGM has spared no cost in sets and costumes but this is clearly a scene by scene remake that brings nothing new to the story, no added dimension of enjoyment except for the color and the technical improvements for the twin photography. It moves at a rather stately pace, as though impressed enough with its own trappings to conclude that a viewer needs nothing more.STEWART GRANGER and DEBORAH KERR are graceful replacements for Colman and Carroll and both look splendid in their roles with Granger having considerably more acting to do in a dual role when he assumes the identity of the King of Ruritania. The famous story has him as the commoner posing as the King and falling in love with Princess Flavia. Of course, there has to be a villain and JAMES MASON fills that role superbly as Rupert, involved in the plot to kidnap the real King in a struggle for power. It's the kind of role Mason specialized in for a decade or so previously and he's a scene stealer. Likewise, ROBERT DOUGLAS as a fellow conspirator plays another villain with relish.It's a lavish costume adventure/romance of the highest order, prettified in color by Technicolor so that it seems like a fairy-tale for adults. And it is. It's fantasy, beautifully realized of course, and a feast for the eyes.The final duel between Mason and Granger makes up for any lulls along the way. It's one of the best choreographed swashbuckling duels since "The Adventures of Robin Hood".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>High budgeted MGM film of fantasy and another time is typical of the work the studio was doing in the early 1950s. Although they were as usual doing some great work around this time, there were some pretty forsaken awful films getting a release at this time, and this was a film which could have been more, but wasn't.Remake of the 1937 Ronald Colman classic, the latter is a disastrous film, probably an ill advised adventure. Probably inspired and riding high by the big biblical hit "Quo Vadis" made the year before, art decorative sets of mammoth proportion formed a Zenda which is noticeably studio bound and lacking magic. In bold technicolour, these sets stick out annoyingly like a sore thumb. However, the costumes were a nice touch.Stewart Granger was laughably miscast. His performance in the dual role, I found, was dull and almost unbearable. Deborah Kerr is actually better as the beautiful Princess Flavia, but on the whole she too is disappointing. The supporting cast even worse, but with the mediocre script, the actors cannot be entirely blamed themselves.This is a classic example of a good story ruined for Hollywood overpriced grandeur. I found the remote control to press onwards more easily than a laugh or even a good stretch of a scene. Only the Deborah Kerr sections were watchable, and its a wonder that after this would-be junk that the film spawned a gem that year, "Singin' in the Rain".Rating: 5.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of turning to a proved success rather than come up with an Original Screenplay is something that seems to beset only producers of today whereas this film is proof that it has been going on for more than half a century. They may have opted to film the 1937 version shot for shot but, alas, they couldn't replicate the original cast and had to settle for acting joke Stewart Granger, insipid Deborah Kerr and rely on James Mason to supply the only decent acting amongst the principals, plus strong support from Louis Cahern and Robert Coote. The story itself retains all its Boy's own Paper razzamatazz and it's one of the few properties which does not suffer by the addition of colour. Once you get past the wooden Granger and the passionless Kerr you can bask in the charisma of Mason and beguile the time pleasantly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There have been several versions of Anthony Hope's venerable Graustarkian adventure made into films. The 1952 version featured MGM's imported British leading man, Stewart Granger in a dual role, with Deborah Kerr as his leading lady, James Mason as a charismatic villain, Robert Douglas as the king's enemy and Louis Calhern and Robert Coote as loyal friends of the weakling king. Also featured were Lewis Stone as the Cardinal and Jane Greer as the enigmatic woman in the proceedings. The production was under the general direction of veteran Richard Thorpe; the screenplay, done from the Hope novel, was the work of Edward Rose and Wells Root, who did the adaptation, John Balderston and Noel Langley the screenplay, with additional by Donald Ogden Stewart. In terms of the production, this is the usual "A" effort by MGM, with the curious exception of the studio heads' usual refusal to pay for sufficient outdoor or location footage. The crystal-clear cinematography was the work of Joseph Ruttenger, the art direction by legendary Cedric Gibbons and Hans Peter, the very fine set decorations by Richard Pefferle and Edwin B, Willis, with vivid costumes by Walter Plunkett and music composed by Alfred Newman in 1937 reused from that earlier MGM version of this work. The familiar story allows notice to many characters but, as is usual in an adventure, develops less than a dozen. It tells the exciting story of Rudolf Rassendyll, a Brit on holiday who returns to his ancestral homeland, the kingdom of Ruritania; there he is discovered by two startled supporters of the young king Rudolf V to be the image of his distant cousin. The year is 1897, and Rassendyll is repeating in reverse the journey that took a member of the Elphburg rulership to England where he produced the Rassendyll line by the wife of a British nobleman. The new king, about to have his coronation and wed Flavia, his intended, has two major problems. One is that he is a an amiable not-overly-bright inebriate and the second is that his half-brother Michael, merely a Duke because he is illegitimate, wants both the girl and the throne. The night before the king's official crowning, Michaal drugs him so people will think he was drunk and missed the event. The loyalists persuade Rudlof to substitute for the new King at the coronation; and when Michael kidnaps the king and takes him off to the Castle of Zenda, now neither party can reveal what has happened. Of course, Rassendyll is dismayed; but the loyalists train him and he is much better kingly material than his cousin ever was, so he does quite well. Then he meets Flavia, a marriage of state bride-to-be, and falls in love with her. Other players in this elaborate chess game include Michael's mistress, who aids the loyalists because she does not want to lose his love, and Rupert of Hentzau, dangerous second to Michael, who simply craves power and is the most dangerous of all. The situation eventually requires swordfights, the odd death, and an assault on the Castle to rescue the young king before he might be dispatched. But the main body of the screenplay is the hopeless romance between Rudolf and Flavia, who knows he is different but cannot be told why, or how he has changed. At the end, impossibly, Rudolf bows to Flavia's iron sense of duty and leaves her to try to make something of Rudolf and of Ruritania why he rides into the sunset--there being no other possible ending in the far-from-gay Nineties of the 19th Century for either of them. The ending is unsatisfying; but author Hope left no way out for any filmmaker. He also set up a sequel because, of the conspirators, Rupert of Hentzau escaped. In this film, Granger has one of his best roles as a brave and ethical young man; Deborah Kerr is lovely, acts very well and shows the emotional reluctance of her character to attain selfhood and renounce royalty very clearly. James Mason and Robert Douglas are outstanding in their villainous parts, even better together than separately; Jane Greer, Louis Calhern and Lewis Stone are very fine. This is a luminous understated romance, an interesting adventure, and a surprisingly absorbing film throughout. The dialogue is very far above average, and it is all delivered professionally. My favorite of all the filmed versions of this story and its Garustarkian counterparts.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Hope's novel never appealed to me as a young man--the story of look-alikes ruling countries abound in "The Prince and the Pauper" and its ilk. To film the story, one would expect a director to go beyond the text and put an intelligent perspective to the story. Anthony Thorpe does nothing of the kind but settles for good looking actors and good sets. Children would love it because it is so uncomplicated and you do not have to think beyond what you are told on screen.The only redeeming feature in the film was James Mason's above average performance. Deborah Kerr's performance is lackluster compared to her fine performance in The Night of Iguana, which convinces me that an inspired director can make an actor come alive on screen--and an unspired one merely make one look good. The other actors do not deserve mention.</fullReview>
