		<shortDescription>Incest through a third party.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The melodrama of which Stahl was one of the masters throughout the thirties had muted,probably because the importance of the film noir in the following decade."Leave her to heaven' is as much a film noir as a melodrama.What's particularly puzzling is the color. Like some Lang ,HItchcock or Tourneur works ("secret beyond the door" "spellbound" or "cat people",for instance) ,this is par excellence a Freudian movie.The heroine has never solved her Oedipus complex :she has always been in love with her father -dig the scene when Gene Tierney rides her horse as she throws her father's ashes away. The love she could not make with her father ,she will make it through a third party: a husband who resembles her dad. This could be fine.She loves her husband to the exclusion of all others .But there are others ,and they are all living threats.So these intruders will be enemies.The scene when Tierney sees her family coming through binoculars can be compared to an attack of Indians or bandits when the hero is alone in a remote fort in an adventure film ,as Bertrand Tavernier pointed out in "50 ans de cinéma américain". Had the heroine preserved her intimacy -and how stupid her husband was not to have understood that!-,maybe nothing would have happened.THe color,which might seem irrelevant in a film noir ,is actually necessary because "back of the moon" ,the island in the middle of the lake is a paradise ,soon to become a lost paradise,then a living hell. A probably never better Gene Tierney outshines every other member of the cast ,which is first-rate though.Little by little,we see her become a monster ,and the actress's performance is so convincing (along with a superb script from which a lot of today's writers could draw inspiration) that it gives her horrible crimes an implacable logic.Like in a Greek tragedy. "Leave her to heaven " is by no means "romantic trash" .It's the crowning of Stahl 's career in which he transcends both melodrama and film noir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Stunning Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams, LEAVER HER TO HEAVEN is a stunning 40s film, filled with spectacular set decorations and Oscar-winning color cinematography.The story is a solid melodrama about beautiful Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney in her Oscar-nominated performance) who marries a naive novelist (Cornel Wilde). He is drawn into her family on the eve of the ceremonial scattering of her father's ashes in New Mexico. From the getgo the family seems full of angst as everyone stays out of Ellen's way. On a whim, she breaks her engagement to a lawyer (Vincent Price) and marries Wilde.Everything seems OK until they visit his crippled brother (Darryl Hickman) in Georgia. She seems jealous of Wilde's attention to the kid. Somehow, plans are made for the three of them to go to Wilde's "lodge" in Maine, where a faithful servant )Chill Wills) also lives. Tierney seems more and more edgy and starts to openly resent Hickman and Wills. And then her mother a step sister (Mary Philips, Jeanne Crain) arrive from Bar Harbor.Everything starts to unravel at this point as Tierney becomes convinced that Wilde and falling for Crain. A series of mysterious accidents happen and there is a big (overblown) court case tried by the man (Price) she dumped to marry Wilde and a stunning turn of events.The movie is gloriously filmed in rich Technicolor that accentuates deep reds, warm golds, and luscious shades of turquoise. The Maine and New Mexico interiors are just great and look like they came out of a contemporary magazine, including the simple little lodge by the lake. Also of note is the driving dramatic score by Alfred E. Newman.Tierney is superb as the troubled Ellen and has never looked more beautiful. Wilde is suitable perplexed as the the novelist. Crain is solid as the stalwart sister. Price overacts outrageously (but it's fun). Philips, Wills, and Hickman are good. Others in the cast include Ray Collins, Olive Blakeney, Gene Lockhart, Mae Marsh, Grant Mitchell, and Reed Hadley.LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN ranks among the best melodramas of the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Tierney delivers memorable performance in this technicolor film noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While most film noirs conjure up images of terror in black-and-white settings, 'Leave Her To Heaven' manages to fall into the noir category despite its lush technicolor scenery and handsome interiors. It's a visually stunning example of "women's noir" performed to the hilt by a talented cast. Only Cornel Wilde fails to deliver. He seems too weak as the author who impulsively marries a beautiful woman, only to find that beneath the lovely exterior is a warped mind consumed by jealousy. He never quite measures up to Tierney's performance--seemingly sweet and kind but actually cold and cunning. Tierney has never been more beautifully photographed and looks stunning throughout. Jeanne Crain does well enough as the demure half-sister, rising to the occasion when the script demands a spunkier side to her personality. While the plot gets a little "heavy" at times, it's a supremely satisfying melodrama played against some of the most beautiful settings imaginable. Alfred Newman's music suggests the slowly developing tension. All in all, a fascinating example of film noir that succeeds despite technicolor. Another fine example of color noir might be 'Chinatown'. Well worth seeing to watch a fascinating femme fatale at work. Gene Tierney deserved her Oscar nomination--but lost to Joan Crawford of 'Mildred Pierce'.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No one can watch this without remembering Gene Tierney's searing blue eyes, Jeanne Crain's face of innocence, or Cornel Wilde (lightyears from The Naked Prey) here looking like a photo of Pierre &amp; Gilles come to life. It's 110 minutes of color-time-travel basking in the surreally saturated Technicolor palette of the mid 40's.For those who have been denied the experience of watching the recently restored version with a rapt audience on a big screen as happened April 26, 2008 at San Francisco's Castro Theatre, I can only hope you'll contact a film preservation-minded theater in your area.Though I've watched this film on DVD, nothing prepared me for the impact of the big screen. The closeups alone will take your breath away. Is it melodrama or is it noir?--leave that to Heaven!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What Shall Be Done With This Jealous Woman? Let Heaven Deal With Her!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lushly photographed in Oscar-winning Techincolor, this film version of Ben Ames William's novel is an engrossingly watchable portrait of a possessive, jealous woman, a role that earned Gene Tierney an Oscar nomination.There is an obvious tension between Ellen Berent (Tierney) and her mother (Mary Phillips), especially when it is hinted that Ellen and her late father had a special, close relationship. When the exotically beautiful socialite Ellen meets the handsome, gentle, and rather naive novelist Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde), she is taken with him because of his resemblance to her deceased dad. They gather with Ellen's family at the ranch of a mutual friend, and Ellen has Richard under her spell, discarding her fiancée Russell Quinton (Vincent Price)like last week's garbage. She proposes to Richard, and states breathlessly, "I'll never let you go,", and the poor guy (and the audience) has no idea what he is in for. It also seems that everyone but Richard (and the viewer) is aware of Ellen's demands of attention and possessiveness, as the narrator and family friend Glen Robie states early in the film, "Ellen always wins", and "Nothing ever happens to Ellen".As soon as they are married, they travel to Georgia to meet Richard's handicapped brother, Danny (Darryl Hickman), and although Ellen helps look after him (and even teaches him to walk with crutches) she is incensed by the intrusion of him into their lives, their home, and basically, of any other person coming between her and her husband. When her mother and sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain) come for a visit, she is all but enraged and her icy reception sucks all the fun out of that party!!! After her family departs, Ellen secretly takes Danny out in the lake for swimming, and deliberately lets the poor boy drown so she can have Richard all to herself. The crestfallen novelist and his manipulative bride then go to stay with Ellen's family, and on the advice of Ruth, she decides to give Richard a baby. However, Ellen is soon disillusioned with the idea, bemoans the fact that she will soon lose her figure (and her husband's attention), she coldly puts on a beautiful blue evening gown, applies red lipstick and deliberately throws herself down a flight of stairs, and succeeds in miscarrying the son that Richard so wanted. She then focuses her obsession on to her gentle sister, seeing the friendship Ruth shares with Richard, and in a self-righteous tirade, berates her long-suffering sibling (actually cousin adopted by the family), unwittingly revealing her dastardly deeds for Richard to overhear. He leaves her, preparing to file for divorce, so Ellen hatches her most evil scheme of all - she writes a letter to Quinton saying that Ruth is planning to kill her, and then poisons herself at a family picnic in order to frame her sister. The truth, however comes out at trial and Harland is forced to serve a prison sentence of two years due to his knowledge of Ellen's crimes, but once he has served his time, he and Ruth, whom had declared her love for him at the trial, unite against a epic sunset . . . . . . . .Tierney and Crain look fabulous, and could easily pass for sisters. Ellen's "nightmare" is an effective foreshadowing of Danny's death, and her jealousy over Enid Southern, a girl from Harland's past, adds more richness to the movie. Chill Wills is great as handyman Thorne, and Vincent Price is a perfect unwitting accomplice in Ellen's last scheme. There are biblical references that resound in the film, for example, Ellen is portrayed as a serpent emerging from dark waters in one scene, while Ruth is presented as an angelic, nurturing, gardening, animal-loving cherub. Another interesting analogy is that on the way to the ranch, Ellen is anticipating hunting and eating wild turkey, while Ruth can't wait to see the new colts. The theme music is dramatic and adds fuel to the already burning fire of the drama.It is classified as film noir, and even with the color photography, it makes sense. An interesting presentation of a truly malicious character.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"I'll never let you go. Never, never, never"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think I agree with those who have designated 'Leave Her to Heaven (1945)' a film noir. This Technicolor picture ? and it's surprising how much the presence of colour can distort the tone of a film ? feels much closer to the claustrophobic domestic melodramas of the same period, such as Hitchcock's 'Rebecca (1940)' and 'Suspicion (1941),' and Cukor's 'Gaslight (1944).' But there's one important difference. By reversing the gender roles, and placing the power in the hands of the wife, director John M. Stahl here creates a formidable femme fatale, personified by the lovely and luminous Gene Tierney. The vibrant Technicolor photography is certainly pleasing to the eye, and the saturated colours add a perhaps-unintended touch of the surreal, but the dazzling colour palette distracts from and obstructs the film's darker themes. As much as I wouldn't like to deprive myself of Tierney's sparkling green eyes, I think that, in terms of atmosphere, 'Leave Her to Heaven' would have worked better in black-and-white.The film starts off in the classic noir style: told in flashback, the story opens with popular author Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde), who meets an alluring woman, Ellen Berent (Tierney), on a train. Ellen quickly charms Richard with her dazzling looks and strong personality; soon, despite her own engagement to a prominent lawyer (Vincent Price), she has proposed their marriage, an offer he finds impossible to refuse. Here, 'Leave Her to Heaven' takes a distinct turn in storytelling approach, abruptly shifting its attention to Ellen's perspective, at which point we begin to recognise that perhaps she isn't as lovely as her new husband has been led to believe. The new couple move to Richard's secluded lakeside lodge, where they must also care for his crippled younger brother, Danny (Darryl Hickman, giving one of those "excited boy scout" child performances that were popular in the 1940s). As the weeks go by, Ellen's near-obsessive love for Richard begins to brood anger, hatred and jealousy, culminating in the cruelest of acts.Tierney's character initially elicits an amount of sympathy, especially given Richard's apparent inability to recognise his wife's desperate need for privacy and intimacy in their relationship. However, it doesn't take long before her behaviour, fuelled by suspicion and paranoia, becomes entirely contemptible, and there's no longer any trace of the charming enchantress we saw in 'Laura (1944).' Ellen's psychosis is an intriguing one: she was obviously obsessed with love for her own father ? what Freud called "feminine Oedipus attitude," or Electra complex ? and, following his death, subsequently fell in love with Richard, who bears a remarkable resemblance to him. Such is her passion for her father, through Richard, that she cannot bear to share him with anybody; thus, her mania stems from the simple notion that "she loves too much." Ellen's murders are shocking in their own low-key simplicity, and Tierney, who received her only Oscar nomination for the role, carries out her evils with an icily-impassive face. But, geez, even this chilling portrayal can't make me stop loving her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Rainbow noir...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Can a film noir be effective in glorious colour or is that a contradiction in terms? Anyway I found this lesser-known thriller to be as exciting and involving as any other black-and-white-mean-streets scenario that the 40's threw up. Tightly plotted, well acted and above all, beautifully photographed, I was gripped from first to last. My only caveats might have been the "framing" device of Cornel Wilde's lawyer's top-and-tail introduction and epilogue, which just takes away a little of the dramatic tension, an over-intrusive musical score, particularly at Wilde and Tierney's first "strangers on a train" meeting and also the fact that more wasn't made of the conclusion of the otherwise tautly drawn crucial trial scene. The acting is top-rate, with no discernible weak links. Wilde, as the duped author, shows hidden depths to his handsome exterior, Crain, in a sub De-Havilland part modulates her performance winningly as her character's importance to the plot develops and Vincent Price is absolutely excellent as Tierney's abandoned fiancé, a lawyer on the make who convincingly destroys Wilde and Crain in his vengeful piece-de-resistance as the prosecuting counsel. What a shame he was later reduced to his stereotype cackling mad-man persona of seemingly dozens of horror films. He's a revelation here, almost stealing the movie in said trial scene where he's made to recite long pieces of staccato dialogue which he delivers pitch-perfect. Gene Tierney, of course, is enthralling in the pivotal role of the possessed / possessive Ellen, who uses her obvious beauty and sophistication to ensnare Wilde, before taking off into psychopath territory, which sees her effectively kill Wilde's disabled but adored younger brother and devise an almost perfect beyond-the-grave trap for Wilde and Crain to fall into. Great as all these pluses are, I keep coming back to the cinematography which captures like no other film I've ever seen tones of radiant beauty in almost every shot, both interior and exterior. In fact all I can say to finish is that I could find very little to fault this glorious but unheralded example of the golden age of Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of her best roles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was ONE of Gene Tierney's best roles, outside of Laura. She plays a woman lost in jealousy and unjustified vengeance. You understand her love for her husband and are not horrified by her murderous acts because she is so lovely and really not a bad person. You also sympathize with her, because you sense her loneliness. She has to be lonely because she's so caught up this web of jealousy. Who can she confide in with it? No one. Cornel Wilde is sort of a dolt to not see how "mad" is wife is. There are questions you can see he wants to ask of his mother-in-law, but doesn't to his detriment. I love, love this movie. Buy it - you'll watch it over and over again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN (John M. Stahl, 1945) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Technicolor noir is intrinsically a paradoxical term but this stunningly handsome melodrama ? which deservedly copped cinematographer Leon Shamroy a consecutive Academy Award ? is probably the most successful example of this anomaly within the prolific genre. Gorgeous Fox starlet Gene Tierney (who also received her sole Oscar-nomination for her efforts here) gives an excellent central performance as the pathologically jealous heroine who ensnares a chance acquaintance on a train (novelist Cornel Wilde) into marriage while summarily dismissing her current fiancée (prospective D.A. Vincent Price) via telegram. Wilde's younger brother (Darryl Hickman) is a cripple and when she finds herself having to take care of him while her hubby writes away in his cabin, she soon takes matters into her own psychotic little hands and lets the boy drown after suffering a cramp brought on by her egging to exercise himself further. The relationship between Tierney and Wilde is never the same again and he finds solace in her kind-hearted, red-headed half-sister (Jeanne Crain) who had earlier suggested that Tierney conceive a child so as to bring Wilde back to her. However, when she realizes their new-found proximity, Tierney deliberately throws herself down a staircase to lose the child. Furthermore, Tierney had had an unhealthy attachment to her late scientist father which turned the relationship with mother into a cool one; taking a trip down the cellar (where father's old mixtures are stored) on the eve of a picnic, she spikes her own food with poison but not before sending off a letter to Price incriminating Crain of her own murder!! Wilde and Crain make a handsome couple but are not overly taxed by their roles; on the other hand, Price makes the most of the juicy opportunity provided by the film's climactic trial sequence in which he grills Crain into declaring her love for Wilde and also contrives to make the latter an accessory to murder (punishable by a short imprisonment) for having withheld Tierney's confessions to him of her own evil deeds! The supporting cast also features a handful of familiar faces: Ray Collins (as Crain's guardian), Chill Wills (as Wilde's manservant) and Gene Lockhart (as the family doctor); director John M. Stahl was the Douglas Sirk of his day and handles the material with consummate skill while composer Alfred Newman lends it a quite remarkable musical backing that was oddly bypassed at the Oscars (although, truth be told, he was already being nominated for two other films that same year)!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsession and Destructive Jealousy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After two years in prison, the Bostonian writer Richard Harland (Cornel Wild) returns to his cottage "Back of the Moon", in Deer Lake, Maine. His friend and lawyer Glen Robie (Ray Collins) tells the story of Richard to an acquaintance of his.While traveling to New Mexico by train to spend a couple of days in Glen's Jacinto Rancho, Richard meets the young and beautiful Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) reading his last novel. On the station, he finds that Ellen, her mother Mrs. Berent (Mary Philips) and her stepsister Ruth Berent (Jeanne Crain) are also guests of Glen. Along the days, Ellen calls off her engagement with the politician Russell Quinton (Vincent Price) and marries Richard.Richard travels to "Back of the Moon" with Ellen and his crippled brother Danny (Darryl Hickman) and Ellen feels jealous of Danny and the caretaker Leick Thome (Chill Wills). After the visit of Mrs. Berent and Ruth, Ellen tries to convince Danny to go to their house. Danny prefers to stay and Ellen plots a scheme and Danny drowns in the lake.Richard and Ellen move to Mrs. Berent's house and Ellen decides to get pregnant to get more attention from Richard. But later she provokes an accident and has a stillborn baby. When Richard leaves Ellen, the obsessive woman plots her own death to incriminate Ruth. "Leave Her to Heaven" is a melodrama that tells the story of an obsessive female fatale with a destructive jealousy of her husband and capable to plan her own death to destroy the life of her stepsister. Gene Tierney has a fantastic performance and was nominated in 1946 to the Oscar of best actress in a leading role. Her character has also a non-resolved Oedipus complex and her attraction for Richard is due his resemblance with her beloved father.I found that the title "Leave Her to Heaven" is a quote from Hamlet in a scene when the Ghost tells Hamlet to not seek revenge against Queen Gertrude, but rather leave her to heaven meaning that Heaven will judge her. The conclusion is rushed after Richard telling that Ellen was a monster and disappoints a little bit. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Amar Foi Minha Ruína" ("Love Was My Ruin")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good and evil with no shades of gray</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recommend purchasing the DVD of "Leave her to Heaven" in order to listen to Darryl Hickman's recollections of working on the film as a 14 year old child actor, playing the part of Danny Harland, the crippled brother of the protagonist, Richard Harland (played by Cornel Wilde). Whether you agree or disagree with Hickman's comments, they remain fascinating and will give you insight into the making of this film.Hickman recalls that director John Stahl treated him very poorly halfway into the making of the film. In the most famous scene in the movie, where Gene Tierney's character Ellen, allows Danny Harland to drown in the lake, Hickman states that he was forced to shoot many takes of the scene, swimming in ice cold water and freezing cold temperature. It was so cold that Hickman's stunt double refused to shoot the scene and Hickman was forced to act in the scene himself. At one point, Hickman got a cramp in his leg and he sensed that he was beginning to drown; Stahl ignored Hickman's pleas but fortunately an assistant on the set realized that the kid might be in serious danger and pulled him out of the water. The scene in the lake took almost three weeks to shoot. Hickman says Tierney was completely cold to him and seemed to support Stahl in his lack of support of the sensitive child actor.Ironically, Stahl's attitude toward Hickman changed half way through the shooting of the picture. It seems that the producer, Darryl Zanuck, saw the rushes of the drowning scene and told Stahl that it was the most powerful scene he had ever seen in the movies. Stahl started to call Hickman by his first name and no longer referred to him as "son", which Hickman regarded as an insulting epithet. Now Stahl started to refer to Cornel Wilde as "son" and Hickman relates that the director treated Wilde very poorly throughout the rest of the filming of 'Leave her to Heaven'. In fact, Hickman maintains that Wilde told Stahl after filming was completed that he would never forget how Stahl mistreated him. And Hickman also maintains that Tierney treated Cornel Wilde quite coldly, always taking the director's side in his disparagement of Wilde.Hickman's claims that Tierney didn't think much of Wilde's acting abilities is borne out by Tierney's recollections in her autobiography, "Self-Portrait". Tierney refers to the scene in the library and writes: "The scene was difficult for Cornel, who was meant to be weak and couldn't quite bring it off." She adds that Stahl turned to Wilde at one point and said, "They (referring to gaffers on the set) all seem to understand how the scene should be played, why can't you?" Hickman felt that Tierney's abilities as an actor were limited. He felt she was an emotionally constricted person who couldn't open up to people in general. He's aware that Tierney later had to deal with bouts of mental illness but concedes he knows little of the details of her personal life. Tierney was a troubled person during her career as an actor which she readily admits in her autobiography. One important point that Hickman is apparently unaware of is that Tierney gave birth to a retarded child in 1943 which certainly had a deleterious effect on her mental health in later years.The conflict between Hickman and Tierney may have been simply due to the fact that Hickman needed more support since he was only 14 years old at the time he was working on the picture. Tierney on the other hand was probably more of a no-nonsense type who didn't believe in socializing while she was on the set.Leave her to Heaven was sumptuously filmed in the Technicolor of its day. The 2003 digital transfer restores the faded colors of an earlier print to the plush hues we see on the DVD today.The big problem with Leave her to Heaven is that the first half is all exposition. It's extremely slow-moving and we only get hints that something dramatic is going to happen. Finally, we're rewarded with the machinations of Tierney's evil Ellen Berent Harland in the second half. The high points come in spurts: Ellen sitting in the boat, casually doing nothing as Danny drowns; the shocking scene where she intentionally throws herself down the stairs in order to abort her unborn child and her grand exit where she commits suicide in order to facilitate her half-sister being charged with murder. Even today, those scenes pack an emotional wallop.Despite Ellen's gripping histrionics, the other principal characters played by Cornel Wilde and Jeanne Crain, the husband and the half-sister, fit the typical victim mold of melodrama and are too beatific and wooden to be considered at all compelling. Speaking of histrionics, Vincent Price is much too over the top as the District Attorney with his one-note (and much too angry) grilling of Cornel Wilde while he's on the stand in the courtroom.Finally I couldn't understand why Harland gets two years for "withholding evidence". It's inferred that the "withholding of evidence" occurred earlier in Harland's testimony when he fails to inform the court that Ellen stood by and let his brother drown. But where is the proof that Ellen actually did nothing? The court only had Richard's take on what had occurred and certainly that testimony is not backed up by any independent witnesses.Leave her to Heaven will be remembered for its stunning cinematography as well as its portrait of a demented 'femme fatale'. Aside from a few classic scenes, it's a film that plods along and only manages to capture your attention during its most salacious moments. Leave her to Heaven descends into the morass of victim-hood, suggesting that there is only good and evil in the world and no shades of gray.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite movies! The mystery was the lead character, Ellen; the cool, lovely and smoldering and so much more. Ellen Berent Hartman is the adult version of Rhoda Penmark in The Bad Seed (1956). Totally ruthless, unfeeling and riveting. Gene Tierney (Ellen) gave the performance of her career! Cornel Wilde was a good foil for her as her unsuspecting husband, Richard Hartman. This movie is about the rare breed of human who has feelings for no one, consumed by their own selfish desires. The costars almost faded in the background at times in comparison to Tierney's performance. Yet, every character had their moment to shine. Vincent Price does a great job portraying the jilted fiancé whose fierce determination to see justice done is just an expression of loss and unrequited love. Jean Crain was appropriately forlorn and Chil Wills' expression of horrid realization was chilling (no pun intended). With all of the cards seemingly laid on the table for the audience, there is still room for suspense. If you like a suspenseful drama, don't miss this movie. I watch it every chance I get.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Color, Contrasts &amp; Deadly Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It would be impossible to watch "Leave Her To Heaven" without being struck by some of the stark contrasts which it contains. Its very dark story is depicted in glorious Technicolor, its main character appears to be beautiful and sophisticated but is actually evil hearted and capable of great cruelty. One of the many stunningly beautiful exterior locations is used as the setting for a crime which is both shocking and heinous and similarly an act of extreme wickedness is perpetrated in one of the movie's wonderfully opulent interior scenes."Leave Her To Heaven" is a veritable feast of colour, costumes and drama and makes a great visual impact right from the start. Bearing this in mind, it's easy to see why this movie won the 1946 Oscar for "Best Cinematography - Color" and was also Oscar nominated for the "Best Art Direction - Interior Decoration" award.The story which is recounted in flashback, describes the circumstances which led to successful author Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) being sentenced to a term in prison. Shortly after meeting Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) on a train journey, Richard becomes captivated by her and they gradually become closer until one day she stops wearing her engagement ring. Shortly after this, her ex-fiancé Russell Quinton (Vincent Price) calls to offer his congratulations on her forthcoming marriage. Ellen introduces him to Richard who was unaware of any marriage plans but just passively plays along with what's happening. Later, Ellen proposes to Richard and he accepts.After their marriage, Ellen gets to know Richard's younger brother Danny (Darryl Hickman) who's recovering from polio. She's very attentive and helps him to start walking again with the use of crutches. This achievement clears the way for Danny to be released from residential care and to go to stay with Ellen and Richard at Richard's lodge called "Back Of The Moon". At the lodge, Ellen starts to become resentful of the time that Richard spends writing and irritated by the constant presence of Danny and Thorne (Chill Wills) who is a woodsman and old family friend. Her discontent worsens when her mother and adopted sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain) arrive for a surprise visit. Ellen's mother and Ruth cut their visit short as it becomes clear to them that Ellen does not welcome their presence. Richard becomes unhappy about how Ellen has treated her family and in a heated conversation she accuses him of being in love with Ruth.During a later incident at the lake near to the lodge, Danny is drowned and following this, the couple move to Ellen's mother's home and Richard becomes very depressed and abandons his writing. He returns to a more positive frame of mind when Ellen becomes pregnant but another incident leads to her losing the baby.Some time later, when Richard's new book is published, Ellen is furious when she sees that it has been dedicated to Ruth. Richard and Ellen have an argument during which she admits the roles she played in the deaths of Danny and their unborn baby. Richard then leaves her but is called back to the house when she is suddenly taken ill. Ellen dies and a dramatic court case follows during which Ruth is charged with poisoning Ellen and the prosecutor is Russell Quinton. Ruth is found "not guilty" but Richard is sentenced to imprisonment for withholding knowledge of Ellen's crimes and in so doing, being an accessory.Ellen's initial attraction to Richard was based on his resemblance to her late father and her subsequent need to constantly have his exclusive attention became a powerfully destructive force."Leave Her To Heaven" is a memorable melodrama in which Gene Tierney gives an exceptional (Oscar nominated) performance as a woman whose extreme jealousy and possessiveness propel her into a series of insane acts which ultimately damage the lives of everyone around her. The precise nature of her psychosis gradually becomes clear as the action progresses and the performance of Jeanne Crain is also very praiseworthy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers Ahead:Yes, Cornell was a pretty boy who was not a very good actor. He is quite wooden here; it would have been a far superior movie if Vincent Price had played the lead. He was a far superior actor as he shows in the court room scene. The problem is that you are really not seeing the script; the difficulty is the code of movies at this time. Notice how all of her family is terrified of her, especially the mother. The key to enjoying this Noir is to understand what could not be said but barely adumbrated very subtly. Notice the sex object is identical to the father who everyone is visibly uncomfortable discussing. The mother is visibly agitated and says,"Who told you that you resemble my husband?" See, this is the 1940s and no, it is not incest through another: incest is clearly implied. Watch the dinner table scene where the father is brought up. Earlier, listen how when Ellen says that she is attracted to Richard,"You look exactly like my father." See, the movie clearly implies a relationship of incest and adumbrates murder by Ellen. The whole dinner comes to a screeching halt the minute the father is brought up. The murder of the father is why they are all visibly terrified of her; notice how they avoid being alone with Richard.When he is courting her, if you can call it that, the women avoid Richard like the plague. All talk of the father is oddly as vague as possible and the subject is changed quickly. If it were just incest there would not be the terror you see at the dinner table. The mother and adopted sister are clearly afraid of her. The incest is not vicarious it is re-enacted. She is seeking a return to the halcyon days of owning her father sexually. I understand many of the above criticisms, but the movie, due to the censorship of the 40s, is like an iceberg. The story is below the surface. If I am wrong, why are they so afraid of her? Why, if it was just incest and not murder, do they look terrified when the father is brought up? See, the mother cries at the end for Ellen was a terrifying monster. The possession of Richard by Ellen, seen within the Zeitgeist of the heyday of Freudianism, is of a daughter for her father. This is not a man / woman relationship; no, it is her regression to her father / daughter incest relationship. A woman who kills with this facility and lack of remorse, so deluded that she confesses it to Richard, thinking it will endear her to him, is a sociopath who has killed before we first met her. Really, if you disagree, there is not any other logical explanation for her mother and adopted sister's terror of her. Even just incest would not generate the apprehension and distancing we experience at the beginning. The family table scene, at the beginning, is the key to understanding the subterranean plot that can be but tenebrously adumbrated. Please, this is the 1940s. I must agree, the acting except for Price and Tierney is shaky. Wilde was the Channing Tatum of the 1940s. The women went crazy for him but he was a bad actor. He damaged Road House just as badly. He was cast for his looks as the object of obsession. With all of its flaws, I have it in my collection. I think if you study it a bit more, and endure Wilde's acting, you will find it rewarding. It reminds you the most frightening things are to be found inside of human beings. Truly, Existential sexual possession of another here creates a terrifying evil monster.

		<shortDescription>B Movie Acting and Story Draped in A Movie Cinematography, Sets, Costumes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is like the Dickens line about, Best of, Worst of. There are elements that are the peak of 1945 film-making skill: cinematography, set decoration, costumes, use of technicolor, music scoring. And elements that are pure B movie-making: a shallow psycho-drama with mostly wooden glib performances. On the one hand, I imagined really talented, nuanced actors as I watched Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde - on the calibre of Barbara Stanwyck and Kirk Douglas, who appeared that same year in a Warner Brothers noir film, Loves of Martha Ivers, and imagined it would have deepened the film. But it didn't help that film, and may not have helped a similarly melodramatic, histrionic film. At the same time, the uber- glamor movie-star quality of Tierney and Wilde added a Douglas Sirkian over-the-top quality to the film's gloss which somehow defines 40s glamor, like Lana Turner and John Garfield. I'm not sure it's a guilty pleasure for me, because I am drawn to Tierney's beauty but find her remote, and never quite suspend disbelief when I watch her act.</fullReview>

Both the main young women (Gene Tierney, Jean Crain) retain their contrasted charms, femme fatale and girl-next-door, respectively, but the casting of Cornell Wilde (normally a sort of bargain-basement Errol Flynn) in the central role is an insuperable weakness, and what's left completely falls apart in the utterly incoherent and grotesque "murder trial," where no one behaves in any way remotely like a human being.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I liked this film a lot. In four years Gene Tierney went from being Laura to Mrs. Muir with a stopover here to play the disturbed Ellen in "Heaven." Vincent Price lost her in both Laura and Heaven, and in Laura her 'death' almost led to him being arrested for her 'murder.' Her voice always has a rich, creamy sound to it, even when she tries to make it cold in "Heaven." A number have commented on the inadequacies of Cornel Wilde, but to me he is near perfect for this role. Tierney's character is close to Scarlett, with that same obsessive mind that carries the latter through her troubles. Rhett gets wise at the end of GWTW and leaves after fighting her tooth and nail the whole three plus hours. Heaven does not need another Rhett to try to cure Ellen, but rather the story demands a hopeless sap who gets sucked into marriage, and Wilde has just the weak streak in him to do so.Another parallel that comes to mind is Danny's death and the murder of Mr. Dietrichson in Double Indemnity. Ellen hides her face behind the dark glasses, while Phyllis does not even watch as Walter kills her husband. We watch Danny drown, but only hear Porter Hall's demise.The trial is a little ridiculous, both in terms of prosecution bullying of witnesses and the fact that Wilde opens his mouth and the case disappears, poof just like that. Had Ruth been convicted, she would have been granted a new trial because of her lousy lawyer.The film is a lot of fun and well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Silly and superficial</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching "A journey through the history of American movies with Martin Scorsesse" I noticed this film and was intrigued by the lake drowning scene. Being a fan of noir mystery, I decided to give it a go, especially because this film was known as the first film noir in color. I had a lot of hope and was utterly disappointed.First and foremost, this film can't be put in any genre to it's merit. It's a half baked romance with touches of half baked thriller, no signs of film noir, and shallow and superficial at that. The makers of this movie probably spent all of their attention on cinematography, intended to daze the audiences with Technicolor, so they neglected the story and character development. I can't believe that Gene Tierney was nominated for the Academy award for her role, which was portrayed with wooden acting and without any true emotions in the decade that gave us so many great leading roles. The characters in this film are also undeveloped because the treatment of the story gave them no room to go. That's why their roles are underplayed as well, and we never see the romance or even the attraction between Richard Harland and Ruth Berent happening until the end, the relationship between Richard Harland and his brother is barely shown and the whole movie is like in a rush to be over, so we just trip over people and what is happening to them. Vincent Price acts like he is in one of his horror films, and there is no real tension in this picture, even though the maniac is on the loose.MAJOR SPOILER COMING: All this silliness and superficiality explodes at the end when in a kangaroo court case, the sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain) is acquitted of the murder of Ellen (Gene Tierney), simply because the husband Richard (Cornel Wilde) told the court that Ellen committed suicide and murdered his brother and his unborn child (not even a brief examination of this facts or evidences to this effect whatsoever), and than Richard gets convicted as the accomplice after the fact and sentenced to 2 years in prison, for the crimes of his wife, he couldn't testify against, under the law, and was in no legal obligation to report on. This is an overall silly and superficial picture, both than and now. Avoid</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Striking melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the kind of film you have to watch understanding the time in which it was made. Talking pictures were only just under twenty years old and people did not realize that film required techniques different from the stage. Two of the leads (Tierney and Price) were both stage actors and were taught to play in the large style that was part of the time and was what audiences expected, as were the grand emotional gestures in the plot of this picture and others, and the ever-present music.Stage productions at that time mostly all had incidental music, specially written for them (one example is Paul Bowles' score for the Broadway stage production of "The Glass Menagerie"), performed live, in the theater.This film has a particularly effective score by Alfred Newman, though loud and melodramatic by today's standards, using an ostinato timpani figure, a kind of throbbing heartbeat, and the musical intervallic motive of the descending augmented fourth, the "tritone", which in the middle ages was called the "Devil in Music", to express the darker side of the lead character's motives and persona.So we should be careful in watching films like this, to understand the context and try to put ourselves in the place of the audiences of that time. If one does, this is a grand experience, with top-notch performances, cinematography, writing and music. Stretch your mind and heart to fit the big emotions and seemingly impossible plot turns, imagine yourself watching this in a huge theater, with hundreds if not thousands of others, on a huge screen, with a very powerful sound system, and suddenly it works.Of course, this is a vehicle for a "star" actress, and Tierney rises to the occasion admirably, holding your attention in every scene she's in, by her beauty and her sheer magnetism on the screen. On the DVD commentary for it, the actor who appeared opposite Tierney as the young boy Danny belittles her "technical" acting approach (that is, working from the outside in, rather than using the inner-directed "Method" developed around that time in America by Lee Strasberg, taking and often misunderstanding and misinterpreting techniques developed in Russia by Constantin Stanislavsky) and he says that, in scenes, she gave nothing to the actor (himself) playing opposite her.Well, first, that's the character she's playing, icy cold, with a "flat affect", as written. As a relatively inexperienced film actress, she was possibly one of those actors who cannot get out of character between shots or while resting on a shoot. In retrospect we know of her serious mental problems which manifested later, and perhaps this role was just too close for comfort!Considering that, watching her playing from this distance, I think she does very well, always present in the scene and listening, with only a very few moments of self-conscious posing. I think Mr Hickman has an ax to grind here; in fact, he does, and he goes as far as to advertise his own teaching practice and book about acting! Let's face it, when we think of this picture and others like it, after all, we remember Tierney, her beauty, her strong screen presence and her vulnerability as the character, not his performance, good as it is.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This Depends On What You Expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How one views this movie probably depends on how they feel about genres. Billed as a "film noir," fans of that genre, expecting the typical hard-edged crime film with tough characters, most likely will be disappointed. Fans of melodramas, however, will be delighted as the movie leans far more in that direction. For my tastes, the film was way too slow and has too much melodrama, but that may have been because I expected something else. Many classic movie fans love this movie. The film did pick up in the second hour once the drowning scene occurred but in my case, it was too-little, too-late. But, don't misinterpret my remarks: it's still a fine film, a true classic.One thing everyone should agree on: the cinematography. One would be hard- pressed to find a prettier 1940s film than this one, especially on DVD with a flat screen or plasma set. It's just gorgeous with an astounding color palette. The the two leading ladies are eye-pleasing, too: Gene Tierney and Jeanne Crain, so there is plenty to ogle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stunningly haunting film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a debate about whether or not this is film noir. Well, I'm not sure about that, but I am rather sure that this is one of the very few classic films that I have ever seen that I find somewhat disturbing. It is not often that we see the premeditated murder of a child on-screen, so this is very powerful, and I'm almost surprised it was allowed considering the 1945 filming.It is unfortunate, considering the Sedona location, that much of the outdoor filming there was during a very cloudy day, thus making the striking scenery look full and drab. Added to that the film transfer, it's a downright shame and deserving of much criticism. It would also be interesting to see a restoration from the original nitrate films (impossible now due to their destruction), because in many scenes the faces (in particular) look so very pasty, while other scenes seem not at all sharp. Further, while some of the exterior shots are lush, others are so cheap looking that it's almost laughable.In terms of acting, I would have to say this is Gene Tierney's finest role. She combines so very well what the role needed -- sugary sweet in some scenes, cruel and psychotic in others.I am less satisfied with Cornel Wilde here. There are a number of his scenes -- particularly in Sedona -- where his dialog seems very staged and stilted.I always loved Jeanne Crain, and here you really have to wait until the second half of the film for her role to take on pivotal importance. Ray Collins, as a family friend, was always a welcomed character actor, as was Gene Lockhart, here as the doctor. A standout supporting role here is the one by Darryl Hickman, as the young polio-stricken brother of Cornel Wilde. And Chill Wills is...Chill Wills...but for a change provides an understated performance. The one supporting performance that seems off the beam to me is Vincent Price -- there is a limit as to just how pompous a lawyer should be! The plot is well done, particularly as you approach the end of the film and the surprise occurs when you get to the courtroom. Not at all what you probably thought was going to happen. It's a very good plot twist.Not a perfect film, but an excellent one overall. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Tierney is great in this film noir thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Photographed in a beautiful technicolor format, Leave Her To Heaven, will be regarded as a film noir that strayed away from the formula of the genre. Heaven strays away from the dark alleys, dimly-lit backrooms and shadowy run-down buildings, opting instead to present a story against the most aesthetically beautiful milieu one is likely to find in any film made in 1945. Scenic visuals aside, Leave Her To Heaven is the definitive film noir in every other way. Rife with deception, murder and the omnipresent femme fatale. The film opens in a tone reminiscent of Hitchcock's Strangers On A Train, as Richard Harland(Wilde) is introduced to his soon-to-be wife Ellen Berent(Tierney) on a speeding train. Early on in the picture, the audience is made aware of Berent's duplicitous nature. Hiding beneath a thin veil of kindness lurks the heart of a cruel, manipulative and ultimately, evil woman. An insanely jealous female, Berent would rather kill than share her husband's love. She proves this by drowning her brother-in-law and later, by throwing herself down a flight of stairs, thus killing her own unborn child. When Harland finally realizes that he might have married a monster it is just a little too late. Even in death, Berent attempts to ruin the lives of those who loved her. The ending is particularly interesting and a total surprise. Gene Tierney seems to be having a great time in her role. She uses her unique facial features, a catlike bone structure and narrow gaze to her advantage. Notice the tight, squinty-eyed stare during Danny's death scene. Cornel Wilde might not have been the best choice for the role of Richard Harland. He is stiff and aloof in his performance. It is imperative to the story that the audience feel sympathy for his character, but due to his weak showing, it is hard to feel anything, let alone sympathy. Much has been made of Vincent Price's campy performance as the love-struck attorney. He is completely over the top and delivers his lines with the hastiness of auctioneer on a time limit. I have to admit, I loved it. Special accolades go to director John M. Stahl who uses the lavish setting and the beautiful colors the way Aldrich might use a dark alley as a device to hide an unknown assassin. This is exemplified best in one specific sequence where the audience watches as blue-colored water undulates savagely as Darryl Hickman's character struggles to catch his breath. It is matched proficiently against the calm icy-blue gaze of Tierney as she watches in an unresponsive pose as Hickman dies a horrible death. The use of colors and the tranquil setting only worked to enhance the sheer direness of the whole moment and the despicable villainess of Tierney's character. It is a testament to Stahl who knew that sometimes change could be a good thing even in such a defined and formulaic genre.Many have noted that film is, at times, highly unrealistic. Indeed, the plot does have an ample amount of noticeable holes. Some of the situations, including the final courtroom duel between two former acquaintances, tend to be a tad implausible. That aside, Leave Her To Heaven is a great installment in a long-line of trashy, seductive titles in the film noir genre. I highly recommend it despite its various flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>She was a monster!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beautiful Ellen Berent unashamedly jilts her fiancé, Russell Quinton, for writer Richard Harland. Her attraction to Harland being that he reminds her of her deceased father. But soon it becomes evident that Ellen is very possessive and literally will do what it takes to keep all away from her newly obtained beau.Director John M. Stahl and writer Jo Swerling adapt from the novel written by Ben Ames Williams. Filmed in luscious Technicolor by Leon Shamroy (Oscar winning), Leave Her To Heaven proves two indisputable things. One is that to craft a searing film noir it doesn't have to be filmed in monochrome, the other is that it's proof positive that Gene Tierney (Ellen) was more than just a gorgeously effective face.Tierney of course needs no introduction to fans of film noir, her appearance and quality of performance in the previous years release of Laura ensures that. While to a lesser degree the mixed Whirlpool four years later also cements her status in the corridors of darkness. But an argument can be made for this being her crowning glory, both in terms of her effervescent beauty and of the performance she gives (Oscar nominated). It's not outrageous to say that the film achieves its greatest heights because of her portrayal as Ellen, a character that is the epitome of the femme fatale. Tierney has this beguiling knack of shifting from charm personified to outright evility, all within a heart beat. And amazingly as Ellen grows more warped and jealous, Tierney grows ever more sexy. It's not just Cornel Wilde's duped Richard Harland falling into her disturbed web, it's any watching male with a pulse. Even as the shockingly cold moments unravel, and there are some truly chilling ones for sure, Ellen draws us in with a lusty fascination that's rather unique.Credit too must go to Stahl's direction, perhaps a director that unfairly sits in the lounge of the unsung? He weaves his story adroitly, setting up plot roads to keep us intrigued, only to then shift focus back on the dame holding court for characters and viewers alike. Wilde does fine, his mannered approach work works well off of Tierney's show stealing turn. While in support we get pretty as a picture Jeanne Crain as the crucial sister character, Ruth Berent, and Vincent Price, elegant as always, does his profession proud in the small but important role of the jilted Quinton.Leave Her To Heaven - a must for noir fans - a must for Tierney fans - and one to get the best out of your High Definition TV. 8.5/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many post-war films, "Leave Her to Heaven" is a study of a troubled individual. Very troubled. This film was a great setup for Gene Tierney to go on and play the manipulative, selfish Isabel in "The Razor's Edge." She looked like a goddess and projected a certain austerity, both of which made her good for this type of role.Tierney plays an obsessively possessive woman who lets nothing and no one get in the way of the object of her affections. In this case, it's Cornel Wilde, whose appeal has always been lost on me. Her mother and adoptive sister (Jeanne Crain) suspect that Ellen has a few problems but sublimate their feelings until they can't even look at her anymore. Ellen is still mourning the death of her father and apparently so dominated his attention that it destroyed his relationship with his wife. "Ellen loved him too much," her mother says. And how much did daddy love her, one wonders, thinking with a modern sensibility. And how exactly did he die? After captivating Wilde, Tierney sets to work making sure he never has a minute with anyone else...in any way necessary! The scene in the lake with her crippled brother-in-law is truly frightening.Though Tierney, in my opinion, was one of the most beautiful women in films, she was never, ever more glorious looking than in this vibrantly photographed production. The most thrilling scene for me is when she scatters her father's ashes - though some may find the music a little strong, I thought it very powerful and atmospheric, particularly in that scene.Believe it or not, "Leave Her to Heaven" was remade as a TV movie with Loni Anderson, which always prompts a friend of mine to say, when a film is mentioned, "Are you talking about the original or the Loni Anderson version?" There's only one version worth talking about, and it's this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie deals with the possessive new wife (Gene Teirney) of a writer, and is beloved by fans for two unusually campy scenes ? Tierney's bored dumping of her father's ashes in the early moments of the film (it could only be funnier if she was chewing gum), and her cruel manipulation of her husband's adolescent brother which results in him drowning (The brother's wholesomeness is rather trying). Both scenes are unintentionally hilarious. But two memorable scenes in a rather long, unimaginative movie are slim pickings. And how dumb is a character that can't figure out killing her husband's brother won't exactly endear her to him? The early idyllic (ahem... cute, wildly unreal, unsatisfying) scenes of two photogenic individuals saying only the right things to each other, give way to those characters' crashing disappointment. Imagine that. There's no storyline at all... just characters in a holding pattern."Leave Her" is sort of interesting in that it understands the growing influence of production design and becomes completely distracted by it; bringing a very wacky misinterpretation of ersatz Frank Lloyd Wright to the masses. Every interior is panoramic, tiered and stratified to the nth degree, with barely a supporting column in sight. The movie is obsessed with interiors and newness. It degenerates into a lifestyle/glamor-envy film.An emphatically silly trial, seemingly that way to conclude the movie at a point it's definitely running long, is not an adequate ending for the piece, but the evil of Tierney is a rather insufficient focus for the whole movie too. Sure, the movie is a color noir, but it never really rescues itself from melodrama, which seems to happen to a lot of noirs with female-protagonists. It's also a noir "production" rather than just a story (very 'luxe!) and that's also an uneasy combo. Vincent Price mediocre-ing things up doesn't help.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>- After reading the plot description and a few reviews, I felt certain that Leave Her to Heaven would be one of those movies I would immediately fall in love with. Gene Tierney's presence alone should have been enough to make it a sure fire winner with me. While it's not bad, I can't give it a full endorsement. As much as I hate doing this, I'll focus on two of the problems that stand out.1. The Plot - I realize that this is a movie and not necessarily a reflection of real life, but the plot was just too unrealistic. We are supposed to believe that this woman was so evil and self-obsessed that she killed herself just to make others miserable. How silly is that? A woman like that would want to be around to see what effect her actions were having.2. Cornel Wilde - My biggest problem with the movie was the casting of Cornel Wilde. He is so utterly dry and vanilla that watching grass grow is more exciting. Rarely have I been treated to a more lackluster performance. Are we really supposed to believe that a character like the one played by Gene Tierney would fall for this guy? I didn't buy it for a second.- With little tinkering on the plot and casting, this could have been an outstanding movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lurid color and even more lurid story in a lush and strange noir</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's not surprising that John Stahl, someone who made his name helming lush romantic weepies would direct one of the most romantic and over-the-top of all noirs. Despite being in color, Leave Her to Heaven fits the noir paradigm in many ways ? the flashback structure indicating that the seemingly upstanding young man who begins the story taking a boat to his house in the wilds of Maine has a dark, terrible past; the femme fatale whose seductive powers are the root of all the ills suffered by both our hero and most of the other significant characters in the film; the terrible prices paid by the innocent, and the reach of fate beyond the grave.Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) is the fatal femme in this tale, latching onto Cornel Wilde's somewhat na?ve writer Richard Harland when they meet by accident aboard train towards a New Mexico ranch where they are (also by chance) spending a vacation at the same time, he alone and she with her mother and sister. Except it's not entirely a vacation for the Harlands ? they are scattering Ellen's father's ashes, and this plot point gives us several opportunities to note the powerful attachment that existed between the two ? and that soon develops between Ellen and Richard, who bears a striking resemblance to the late Mr. Berent.Amazingly soon, Ellen has given up on her ambitious attorney fiancé (Vincent Price) and thrown herself wholly over to the smitten Richard, demanding more and more from him as the film progresses, and her madness and jealousy deepen. To say much more would spoil the fun?this is truly one of the crazier madwoman melodramas from the period, with vivid work from Tierney and Jeanne Crain as her nicer, saner sister and stunning, riotously colorful Technicolor photography from Leon Shamroy. I was less impressed by Wilde, and the coda seems a bit protracted and obvious to me, but still a must-see for noirophiles or fans of romantic excess ? after all, Douglas Sirk was soon to remake a couple of Stahl's earlier films, and he must have known this one quite well also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Chick Flick Supreme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Technicolour was still a cinematic luxury when this classic melodrama was filmed, and director John M.Stahl, together with his lighting technicians use this relatively new novelty to squeeze every last drop of atmosphere from this adaptation of Ben Ames Williams novel.The story is pure melodrama, but it is told with such confidence and style that you don't really mind about the "chick-iness" of this flick. Gene Tierney looks ravishing as slightly bonkers Ellen Berent, one of those Hollywood-only women who appear to have no visible means of income but who is always immaculately dressed and coiffured, even when living in a ? admittedly luxury ? cabin in the woods. Despite this, she is outshone in the looks department by Jeanne Crain as her sweet step-sister. Stahl makes sure to get plenty of loving close-ups of the pair and, between them, they completely overshadow leading man Cornel Wilde's bland Richard Harland, who finds himself embroiled in a whirlwind marriage to the wild ? and slightly strange ? Ellen. Richard reminds Ellen of her father, you see, and so straight from the off we know something about this ideal wife isn't right (In retrospect, you only have to recall that first look she gives Richard in the train carriage to get an angle on what her particular hang-up is).Ellen's problem is she loves too much, and so will let nothing come between her and the focus of her obsession, even when, in a superbly chilling scene that still packs a punch today, this means allowing Richard's crippled brother to drown while trying to swim across a lake. Barmy Ellen also terminates an unwanted pregnancy by throwing herself down a flight of stairs before finally topping herself in a manner that will point the finger of blame for her murder on that sweet Jeanne Crain. Things get a little too overwrought towards the end, and the conclusion is particularly rushed and weak, but this is top-class vintage studio entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beauty IS a Beast</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Tierney is so gorgeous that the viewer may contradict themselves when she becomes an out-and-out menace to her society. This Oscar thwarted turn makes you realize just how great actresses were "back in the day" and Gene Tierney was one of the least lauded but most brilliant. The film has a cool and calculated affect that casts its' spell without the viewer even realizing it. Before you know it there creeps in the villaness of the piece; Tierney blowing us away with her quietly murderous rage. This film used to be an AMC staple (before this channel turned to gruel) and I wish TMC would get the rights to it. Not many contemporary folk have viewed this gem BUT it should be sought out and relished. Wilde was never a great link in films so he just serves as eye candy for the ladies. It is Tierney who rules and holds sway over a truly unique melodrama.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technicolor Eye Candy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a shame with all our modern technology that no one can design a color camera that even remotely comes close to the beauty of Technicolor. Those were the days! And this movie took full advantage of the genius in that technology. The costumes were a color theory extravaganza as were the lush architectural sets and beauteous outdoor landscapes. The horses in the Taos hills were breathtaking. Add to that the alluring and flawless beauty of Gene Tierney and you have a movie worth watching even without a script! This movie could have been silent and it would still be eye candy.As has been mentioned the story is melodramatic but for 1945 it's a psychological thriller that holds up well with time. This is the original dysfunctional family and man are they good at keeping secrets. Whoa...what a evil female villain and such an ignorant milk toast of a husband. You are are most likely to sympathize more with the flipped out bride than the husband. A agreeable little late night indulgence this one is and...Tierney rules!I am a little confused by the title, ?Leave Her to Heaven'. I guess it's supposed to mean heaven is the only place that might know what to do with her...but actually her judgment would most likely have her go the other direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While watching this movie, I couldn't help from laughing as if it were a black comedy. The courtroom scene at the end comes readily to mind, with head numbing repetitions of "when did you love her? Confess to loving her!" The melodrama is so superfluous as to be humorous, which probably is a good thing, as it would just be a plain stupid movie without this enjoyable factor. But while reading this, you might expect me to give a 2-star rating, but the lead performance is spectacular. Her eyes darting around in a paranoid manner, and then stop, glaze over and seem to stare right into your soul. But surely, that can't be enough. It is not, the drowning scene is what lifts it to this seven star rating. It is one of the most chilling scenes ever made, especially as it is more well-known than the movie, so you will be waiting for it anxiously the whole time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty but Wooden, Stiff Writing but truly Great Sets...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave Her to Heaven (1945)I don't know whether to say you should stick out the first, slow beginning to this sadly overrated film to see the justly famous, and chilling, climax scene in the middle of things. Well, if you like movies, you will, which is good.But be prepared. The whole thing is photographed with surprising stiffness, even for color (which has a few technical demands that many other directors have overcome). The camera planted on a plinth, occasionally panning to follow the action. Did I say action? Well, the movie is a melodrama, my favorite, but it's written mechanically, and so is unconvincing, for reasons unknown. Director John M. Stahl has created a mise-en-scene that defies the word. It isn't "real" in any usual sense, but it tries to be, so it comes off contrived. It's attempting a sort of artificial "believability" and yet it's wooden, with all the force of a plot that is overtly forced. Movies can wield this kind of stylization beautifully, but there are so many key factors that are lame here--camera-work, acting (yes), and writing--I don't think it has a chance. I know I'm in a minority here, and see many people love it, but that's the nature of taste. I've seen it twice and came away disappointed twice.Gene Tierney and Cornel Wilde, playing wife and husband, are both less than flamboyant actors. I like them both sometimes a lot, and maybe they fit into the stiffness here. The plot of a woman grotesquely obsessed with her husband is reasonable (without much to convince us why however). But there is still the handling of the variables here that Stahl has to take responsibility for. One example is the almost ludicrously dramatic and overacted scene toward the beginning where they scatter the father's ashes. It's no better than a high school play. I'm all for excess, believe me, but it needs to be convincing, too. Or artful.So what to do? Well, if you make it into the middle of the movie and catch the chilling murder (if it is technically a murder), if you do make it there you'll be hooked by the most basic of devices, a bold plot. Yet what happens next is again relatively prosaic. Even though a pregnant woman throws herself down the stairs, and someone commits suicide not quite convincing enough to pass as a murder, it never quite simmers or smokes. I think in another film I'd be torn up by this stuff, but you would need to really believe in these people by now.I don't think it's just me, though I confess Tierney is an acquired taste, and she's paired up at moments with Vincent Price, as in the 1944 Laura, and with similar stiffness. There's even a dramatic scene where the sister (or cousin, they can't decide) played with dull torpor by Jeanne Craine, lays it all out and says, "You're the most pitiful creature I've ever known," and she stalks away. And Tierney just watches. It's as if she had been told, "And we only have vanilla left." My god, if it's going to be a ridiculous melodrama, it may as well be melodramatic!But hey, I watched it all the way through, and one reason is the set design and lighting. There's a hyper-controlled perfection to every interior, with gorgeous shadows, perfectly color-matched clothes (and furniture, and walls, on and on), shot and choreographed with care under the eye of Natalie Kalmus of the Technicolor kingdom. And if this must make directors tear their hair out (having her around the set interfering, and probably sapping the shooting from some honesty and energy), you can't deny there are some really beautiful spaces color-coordinated. This isn't the ultimate movie for this, I suppose, but look at the train car in the beginning, or many of the large rooms at the various rustic (and expansive) homes and you'll gasp. Oh, yes, it's a little like the dry and cold exquisiteness of an architecture shoot, but at least here there are some people moving through now and then. Actors and actresses, most of them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was in grade school. I thought it was great then, and still think so with qualifications. When I saw the movie the first time I thought the Tierney character was a paragon of evil. Now, withmore understanding of human nature (or so I like to think) I see her as a woman in the grip of a mental illness even she didn't understand and probably couldn't control, a person to feel pity for. She was a psychopath in the sense that she didn't understand normal emotions and relationships. Now for the spoilers--if they are spoilers--since most people are familiar with the plot, but here goes. When Ellen learned her husband was leaving her she plotted her suicidal revenge very cleverly, to the extent of writing for help to the man she had jilted to marry her husband. On the stand, Wilde revealed all of his wife's crimes, which the audience was privy to, but as far as the jury, he provided no evidence whatever for his story. Then, the jury returned with a verdict of not guilty for Ruth in ten minutes. Whoever heard of a jury returning in ten minutes with any kind of verdict? The next implausible turn of plot was that the hero was sentenced to prison as being an accessory to Ellen's killing of Danny. Since Ellen didn't premeditate letting Danny drown,it would probably have been next to impossible to convict her, much less her husband. Who could prove it wasn't an accident? As a one-time aspiring writer I have this thing about gaping holes in plots and plausible motivation. Gene Tierney and Jeanne Crain were certainly two of the most beautiful women in films at the time and were stunning to look at, as was the scenery. I liked the psychological portrait of an unstable and ultimately tragic woman, whose obsession destroyed not only her own life, but that of everyone around her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Greek drama Hollywood style.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the comments I have read suggest that Wilde was too weak to play Richard Harland, the famous author who finds himself suddenly engaged to a woman he barely knows.As an author myself I can say the portrayal rings true rather than false. Most authors are rather reclusive and find social gatherings painful. If they are trying to write something, they don't want others around to disturbe them. Writing is a lonely and demanding occupation and mistress/lover.The contrast between the sexually aggressive Tierney and the reluctant but eager and flattered Wilde is very interesting to me.If you want to see the other side of Wilde-the extravert/charmer, watch him as the Great Sebastian doing his own 'flying' in The Greatest Show On Earth, and you will appreciate the fact that Wilde acting shy and reticent is really ACTING.The suggestion that such a predatory creature could exist is chilling! The idea that her own family could not or would not try to warn Harland before it was too late is tragic.The incestuous suggestions and the obvious sexual ambiguity is palpable.Tierney and Wilde look wonderful together. The perfect couple in love. Vincent Price without his mustache is a shock and hard to get used to. He tries too hard to be the villain of the piece when he is out-matched in that department by Tierney.The cinematography is wonderful. The music is, perhaps a bit too dramatic, but beautiful. Jeanne Crain is a breath of fresh air and a natural victim who is resiliant enough to survive.The story is over-the-top, of course-very Greek tragedy.The Honeymoon couple in double beds (the Hollywood censors at their WORST) is a hoot!The tickling scene is charming, and I got the impression that Wilde really IS ticklish. The wake-up scene is also natural and quite real. Tierney looks like she's having a great time blowing on Wilde's eyelashes while he sleeps, and his stretch and gentle wake up is lovely to watch.Not a GREAT film as films go, but not a bomb either. It is clever, interesting and strikes to the bone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The conventional romance gone wrong in "Leave Her to Heaven"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent melodrama with elements from "film noir", "Leave Her to Heaven" was a film which struck my interest and as I viewed the film, managed to be engaging and disturbing as well as daring and original. With the camera capturing the screen with exuberant delight.The cinematography from the legendary Leon Shamroy is what it is: bright colors, wonderful close-ups with Gene Tierney being the ideal subject for her incandescent beauty and mysterious gaze as Ellen proves to be a woman of complex means, capable of unconditional love yet dangerously jealous and possessive especially when it involves her husband, Richard (Cornel Wilde). Gene Tierney (nominated for the Academy Award of Best Actress in a Leading Role) dominates the plot, balancing the loving devotion of Ellen with her sociopath streak, and avoids turning Ellen into a caricature. What is refreshing about the film is the choice to provide an unusual villain like Ellen, there's more depth and nuance to the character and Gene Tierney complements those characteristics with her range. Solid supporting work is delivered by Jeanne Crain, Vincent Price and Mary Philips. An epic score by Alfred Newman and like "Mildred Pierce", taken as an example, "Leave her to Heaven" gives away into film noir as the blissful union of the leads becomes deadly. Overall, "Leave Her to Heaven" is the kind of film which gives a chilling answer to what might happen after the traditional happy ending, some live in perfect unison and some realize their partner is disturbed as she gazes into your face with those shiny eyes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Pulpy Drama with Dangerously Good Subtext</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave Her to Heaven (1945) marked famed Cinematographer Leon Shamroy's third out of four Academy Awards. Winning first for The Black Swan (1943), he was nominated seventeen times between 1939 and 1966 winning for Wilson (1944) and Cleopatra (1963). Shamroy liked to work almost exclusively in color, using the camera like a brush to paint glorious canvasses of rich hues. Leave Her to Heaven must have been a sight to see back in the day, with its complex sets and outdoor locales. Even today its hyper-naturalistic design is reminiscent of Michael Powell's Black Narcissus (1947).John M. Stahl's Leave Her to Heaven also has another thing in common with Black Narcissus; both films delve into the inner psyche of women unable to control their surroundings. Gene Tierney plays Ellen, a doting woman whose recent loss of her father is rectified by a handsome young writer named Richard played by Cornel Wilde. Turning down an engagement to a future district attorney (Vincent Price), Ellen quickly marries her writer and hopes to enjoy an idyllic life by his side. Things change however with the discovery of Danny (Darryl Hickman), Richard's wheelchair bound younger brother. He, along with her family and Richard's book begin to take more of his time and Ellen grows frustrated, then downright dangerous.I sat down and watched Leave Her to Heaven with my girlfriend who became melancholy by the film. She didn't like it one bit largely because she felt it hit a little to close to home. I assured her she was no Ellen Berent Harland as I doubt she would have it in her to kill (well purposely fail to act in saving one's life). Still I understand her pensive attitude towards Gene Tierney's stellar performance.I feel like she connects to Leave Her to Heaven much like I connect to Taxi Driver (1976). I don't sit to watch Taxi Driver for the entertainment value or the artistry in the filmmaking. I watch it mainly because it is a disturbing look into the mind of a man isolated by his neurosis and altered perception. While Travis Bickle's (Robert DeNiro) disturbing world view is skewed by New York City (as well as his war experience as eluded to in the beginning of the film), Ellen's perception is twisted by the couples isolated home known as Back of the Moon, as well as the death of her father. In that respect, Ellen isn't a villain you can't relate to, nor is a monster that smuggles empathy, Ellen a kindred spirit; a woman who takes that leap from composure to anger and inches across that line just enough to cause harm, and all for the sake of love; hateful, jealous love.We see ourselves in the character of popular fiction all the time. Some are purposely designed to be our surrogates and they transfer their emotions and hardships on the audience. We in turn react and feel elation when they finally succeed at the end of the movie or book. But Ellen is a surrogate of a different breed. We sympathize with her plight and when things get dangerous we are forced to face our own dark side. We face our fears, our anger and our prejudices.In the book of Genesis, God creates man in his image. Consequently, we seem to create everything in ours. But unlike God who has that whole omnipotence thing going for him, we cling to the things we think we can control, like where we live, what we do and who we love, while avoiding things we can't like death. Yet just like the tides or the wind, life ultimately carries with it a sense of danger and unpredictability. My advice, plan what you can, accept the things you can't and leave the rest to Heaven.http://www.theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's all about Tierney</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>She's wonderfully scary in this role, which I view as a sort of precursor to other "crazy chick" flicks like Play Misty for Me and Fatal Attraction. The primary difference is the crazy woman marries the man she's obsessed with--some could argue for no good reason, as Richard is a rather boring chap who happens to remind Ellen of her father. But she has mommy and sister issues in addition to her daddy issues. So the audience knows she's manipulative and obsessive, but it's interesting to see how long it takes for hubby to realize that he actually married a monster. Although the film suggests Ellen is simply evil, she clearly is a sociopath. This film is worth watching primarily because you have these ho-hum dull folks in Ellen's life who all end up being her victim in one way or another, primarily because none of them wanted to accept that this woman was capable of such heinous acts. Tierney deserved an Oscar nomination for the scene on the water alone. She's brilliant in this role.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film with some of the most beautiful images ever put on screen. This film can be enjoyed purely on a superficial level for the cinematography alone. Who wouldn't want to live in those cottages in the hills and the ones beside the lake and the sea? The first third of the film is a masterpiece. The director manages to create a sinister and mysterious mood with the help of the beautiful scenery and the enigmatic GENE TIERNEY.But the rest of the film is a bit underwhelming thanks to some cheesy acting by both CORNEL WILDE and GENE TIERNEY. And the rest of the film lacks the control and mystery of the first third of the film. Too many things are made explicit while you wonder about the callousness of the characters (like why TIERNEY's family did not warn WILDE about her). The token court scene at the end is way too over the top and is plain awful. It is almost as if two different people directed the first 30 minutes and the rest of the film.A sombre JEANNE CRAIN does lend some normalcy to the proceedings. But i recommend the films for the beautiful visuals alone. I don't know if a film in technicolor has looked so good.(7/10)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film is supposed to play me but I don't want to know I'm being played. A Clockwork Orange was supposed to make the audience root for the bad guy to get what's coming to him. I immediately realized Kubrick's aim because it was shallow and pretentious. I felt the same way about the courtroom antics in Leave Her to Heaven. The prosecution able to call the defendant? Absurd. The defense attorney not raising any objections? Unbelievable. The hero not speaking up until the end of the trial and than being believed? Redickulous. All to build tension in the viewer.I felt Tierney was a really bad choice for the bad girl. Patty McCormack was able to carry off the bland look but Tierney failed miserably. She lacked any personality what-so-ever. While beautiful, why on earth would any man want to spend more than a liaison with her? She showed no intelligence, sense of humor or any redeemable qualities. I couldn't accept that an intelligent hero would fall for her. And more, I couldn't accept that the family would have anything to do with her, much less remain silent about her problems when they saw her marriage plans.Finally, although I loved the beautiful settings, the switch to sound stage for outdoor dialog was jarring. It's hard enough to disguise this transition in black and white but color makes almost impossible without extreme care being taken. I'm afraid the cinematographer thought the beauty of the surroundings would be sufficient.Finally, although many of the performances were good, it took much too long to get the story going. The film could have stood some judicious cuts. It was just too slow. In sum, this is a film that begs for a remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What's the matter with Ellen?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone else have a list of films they watch over and over? Well, this one is on my list. I don't know why I keep returning to this film, the story is absurd, and like everyone else says Cornel Wilde's acting is mediocre, and the courtroom scene is over-the-top weird. What makes the film work, however, is the interaction among the characters as they all try to deal with the elephant in the room: the alternately sweet-and-psychotic Ellen, a nucleus of madness around which everyone else orbits. From the very beginning of the film, it's obvious that she's messed up. What sane woman stares at a strange man on a train for ten minutes?Ellen is a complex character whose indiscernible, deep-rooted problems occasionally bubble to the surface; you never quite see her completely, she's like a ghost. When Quinton arrives on a rainy night bringing his drama, none of the people in the house seem surprised; apparently it's business as usual around the unpredictable Ellen. When she disappears for hours at a time in the darkness, they shrug and go to bed; it's just how Ellen is. Too bad Richard doesn't pick up on any of those clues, he thinks they're charming affectations.By far the most disturbing scene in the film is when she takes Danny swimming; the deplorable betrayal of trust never fails to shock me, and you finally realize how inhuman she is. It's difficult to reconcile her radiant beauty with her heartless cruelty, but this is one of the strengths of the film: things are not what they seem. As a furious Ellen feels her husband slipping away from her, she spins an elaborate web to trap her sister; it's an ugly and spiteful way for Ellen to check out, as she drags everyone down in flames along with her. It's the mother I feel most sorry for, her shame at her daughter's behavior permeates the film.I feel that this movie is in a class by itself, and surely ahead of its time because of its edgy subject matter and odd characterizations. The title of the film sounds like a light-hearted romp, which leads me to speculate that this is Hollywood's first black comedy; I always laugh at the scene in the doctor's office, where within the span of ten seconds Ellen completely changes her opinion about Danny, the moment Richard walks in the door.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Obsession has many scary faces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Tierney's tour-de-force in a role of a psychopathic, pathological woman (Ellen Berent) on the verge of insanity makes Leave Her to Heaven the most noir-ish of all noirs filmed in Technicolor. Tierney is indeed the archetype of all the demented women which graced the screen in years to come. Cornel Wilde plays a successful novelist Richard Harland, who falls in love with Ellen during a train trip. Soon they get engaged, and only then is Richard able to grasp the madness that eats his wife from the inside. Her severely troubled state progresses, and when it does no relative is left unharmed. As the days go by, her enormous obsession leads to a bunch of horrible incidents and is the source of a grave misery for everyone who as much as talks to Harland.Leave Her to Heaven is a film about love and there's no doubt about it, but the love portrayed by Gene is so harrowing and unnerving that it makes one reconsider what the feeling really means. It's an emotional bloodbath, and a nightmarish realization of a man's most fatalistic visions. Once Richard gets himself into this deranged ordeal of a marriage he isn't able to escape the cruel fate. His life is spiraling out of control as much as his willingness to live slowly decreases. The only person, who might help him is his wife's lovely younger sister Ruth, but she also becomes a victim of Ellen's sick scheme.Leave Her to Heaven might come as an absurd melodrama for some, but its substance delivers many cringe-worthy moments, presenting one of those 'too good to be true' stories. It's as beautiful in its cinematography as it is frightening in its realization.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half way through a resent screening of this film, I recalled having seen it as a kid on a theatrical re-issue, and distinctly feeling cold even back then. 'Leave Her to Heaven' was the years Technicolor smash for Fox. It looks marvelous ~ acting is very good all round ~ and for a study of jealousy as a pathological mental problem it's tops. The first half has superb style and mood...then how could it miss, with great veteran Director of Photography Leon Shamroy setting up the shots! It's criminal that no-one talks about these 'master' photographers today (A.K.F. 'A Tree grows in Brooklyn' 45 ~ The Robe' 53, ~ The King and I '56 ~ South Pacific '58, ~ Planet of the Apes '68, etc... Add to this a surprisingly BIG Alfred Newman score ---they could have used this one for a Biblical Epic with equally spectacular results-- - It's also interesting to note the editor was James B.Clark, who himself became a major film maker in later years. Problem is, as the story develops, the situations become somewhat overly melodramatic. Next time you see it, follow closely the unbelievable (literally) court case ~ with heavy borrowings from James Hilton's "We are Not Alone" (but that one at least managed to be more believable) And what about that ending!. This might have been introduced by the screen play, as film companies of the time liked to send audiences home on a romantic note... BUT, this could still have been achieved by fading out on the shot of Mr Wilde rowing towards Ms Crain on the balcony...leaving the final moon-drenched (Mills and Boon type) embrace (complete with heavenly violins and chorus) out altogether. Director: John L. Stahl was a big player in the "B" picture business and a popular melodrama man (perhaps the Douglas Sirk of his day). It also appears Martin Scorsese seems to be stuck in a grove with these types of films today (probably from his cinema going youth) It's interesting that these films are being singled out as greats all these years latter - but, if you prefer your stories set in believability, you may not find too much of that here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film, released in 1945, for the very first time last night. Gene Tierney's performance was smashing as the evil Ellen Berent. Directed by John M. Stahl, the color in this film was so sumptuous that at first I thought it was colorized. However, no, thankfully I discovered it was a restored Technicolor print. Leon Shamroy won the Oscar for best cinematography. Never has a film looked so beautiful. Unusual too, as most film noir is shot in luscious black and with lots of deep shadows. This is a film of psychological obsession and jealousy is told in flashbacks from the point of view of a beautiful female antagonist, who gives new meaning to the phrase femme fatale. Cornel Wilde plays the love stricken and somewhat naive husband. The beautiful Jeanne Crain plays the sweet unassuming sister also known as the "gal with the hoe." Vincent Price makes an appearance as a jilted former lover and fiancé and a determined prosecutor at the end. I highly recommend this great film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the better by-products of this technological age is that gradually, via TV and/or DVD one is able to catch up with movies like this that were either released before one's time or just proved elusive. The first problem is almost immediate; after establishing that Cornel Wilde has just returned from two years in the slammer, Ray Collins takes it upon himself to explain the facts of the case to a third party, only thing is he wasn't privy to about 90% of them beginning with Wilde's initial meeting, on a train, with Gene Tierney. Both are, in fact, en route to spend time as guests with Collins but neither is aware of it until they fetch up at the station where he is waiting. There are a few scenes in which all three - plus others - are together but soon Wilde and Tierney take to spending time together and finally, somewhat bizarrely, decide to get married off screen, i.e. the proposal occurs offscreen. Gradually Tierney reveals herself to be hopelessly possessive - she married Wilde only because he resembled her dead father for whom she clearly had incestuous feelings. Once again, as in Laura, Vincent Price gets as far as engagement to Tierney but loses out to another man. It's actually a fine melodrama even if Wilde does little more than look bemused. Jeanne Crain is slightly better as the stepsister in love with Wilde. Well worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the Most Tightly Constructed Masterworks of Subtlety and Symbolism That I Have Ever Seen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The visual richness of Leave Her To Heaven, all the color, all the emboldened and attention- grabbing scenery and the choice of every location being out in the vast American countryside is a streak of brilliance by the director, John M. Stahl, as the dark nature of Gene Tierney's character is made acutely subtle, practically nonexistent until we see a tangible actualization of it, when the script decides for her to put on sunglasses.Cornel Wilde perfectly embodies the harmoniously civilized individual, as if the panoramic Technicolor world of the story is representative of his perspective, which exists under the precepts of order, reason and beauty, all of which replace mere function, granting clearance to those moments at which we would normally scoff such as him and Tierney waking up in the morning fully made up complete with carefully styled hair. It's a subliminal surreality in which society is imposed upon the free form in nature. Tierney is the subterranean instigator, that of unseen nature and the inner workings of the emotions and subconscious, stirring the veiled content of the story's environment with her deep, obsessive, yet hardly visible motivations. And none of this ever alters the beautiful appearance of the movie. Stahl is a careful craftsman who knows the ironic clashing of both worlds in his technical vision.This creates an incredibly potent chemistry between the two characters, and thus the two leads since their performances are both so uncanny. It's as if Tierney is a stranger living in the pure ideological environment of 1940s America who, in her subterranean way, maneuvers her way through her life, not to be frittered away in superficialities. Every person with whom she feels a connection must be seized and squeezed to extract as much benefit as must be afforded her. Lavishing attention on Wilde, she seeks to be everything to him, thus forging an unheard-of insular existence, no matter what the cost, making her a villain in the eyes of the story.The film begins almost surely as if to be yet another movie from the classic era to begin near the end and be told in flashback, which it is. However, this device serves as an important component to the perfect portrayal of clashing realities in nature, as a defense attorney, played by the subdued libertarian likes of Ray Collins, bookends the story by negotiating an expansion of Wilde and Tierney's energies, suggesting a foray into a collective conscious. Also, Vincent Price initializes himself in my mind as a riveting actor as he gives a tremendously tense performance as a forceful, bull-headed and sharp-tongued district attorney who applies the pressure that means to gush the two repelling principles into the amalgam understood by Collins.This movie is one of the most tightly constructed masterworks of subtlety and symbolism that I have ever seen, one that is immediately comprehensible, fascinating and seamless. It is also one of the most beautifully filmed movies I have ever seen, regularly using monochromatic color schemes and the subtlest shades and hues to evoke the seeping through of an incongruous intensity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steely-eyed, steel-plated villainess Gene Tierney makes it fun...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overwrought, but still enjoyable, good-looking soaper has writer Cornel Wilde meeting lovely but strange Gene Tierney on a train ride; she's actually a cold-hearted sociopath who gets him to marry her, then twists his life around to suit hers, making their marriage a living nightmare. Tierney's villainy is often persuasive, sometimes campy, yet gloriously captured in rich color by Leon Shamroy (Oscar winner for his cinematography) and directed for maximum impact by John M. Stahl. Based on the novel by Ben Ames Williams, the film is a bit schizophrenic itself, wanting to be an edgy thriller in the daylight, but also include enough gloss to make it acceptable as a "woman's picture". It actually succeeds at both until the final act, where the overblown, gusty courtroom theatrics brings everything crashing down. Good work from the stars, and from Jeanne Crain in support, but Vincent Price is a bit much. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Ellen Just Loves Too Much"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've ever wondered what all the fuss about Gene Tierney was about, try this movie on for size. In it, she plays Ellen Berent, a possessively jealous woman who doesn't want to share her new husband, Richard Harland, played by the completely un-sexual Cornel Wilde, with *anyone*. "There's nothing wrong with Ellen. She just *loves* too much," says her mother. But there is most definitely something wrong with Ellen, and she makes that evident very early on. Her new husband is mystified that his sweet and charming fiancée has become his scheming and overbearing wife. In his quest to understand his wife, he turns to the sympathetic arms of his wife's sister, played by Jeanne Crain, who really *is* sweet and charming and *furthermore*, she *deserves* a kind and devoted husband like her sister's. The story is none too explicit, though it is shot in gorgeous Technicolor, which serves Miss Tierney *very* well. If fact, her entire *look* throughout this whole movie is spectacular, as she models one great sportswear and lounging outfit after another. She is the epitome of chic in this movie, even when she kills her crippled stepson by letting him drown in the lake from fatigue. She is perfectly accessorized in every scene, and when she casually slips on her cat-eye sunglasses right before she kills the boy, she is stunning. And isn't that what's most important in movies like this? So goes on to purposely miscarry her own pregnancy, and when the jig is up, and he wants to be with her sister and not her, she commits suicide making it appear as if he murdered her. As a widower, he does time, but is released into the loving arms of sister Ruth. Accessorizing all this action are the breathtaking locations, with an incredibly stylish (still) home on the range in New Mexico and their picturesque cottage on Back of the Moon Bay in Maine, which is so gorgeous it looks like a set, but it's not.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>But send Ellen to hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In case of fire: break fast for the nearest watering hole, hold your nose and jump feet first away from the dock. And drowning would be preferable. Cornel Wilde should heed my advice if he sees fit to continue to fraternize with this lady, Gene Tierney. She is the most physically striking woman he has ever seen. But, also, the most disturbed. And by far. "Ellen always wins," says Ray Collins, Wilde's lawyer, agent and family friend. But he is of little help. Wilde sees only sky rockets. Not the truth. Tierney is like an injured black widow spider: spinning, snaring and torturing all those who enter her web. Chilling. Their initial meeting is in a smoking/club car on a train. Blue/green interiors and sleek, almost perfectly lined clothes and props, drench the viewer's eyes. It's a hypnotic effect. Soon after, the lovely Jeanne Crain, a cousin, enters the picture as a competitor for Mr. Wilde's affections--a classic love triangle having been erected. I think water is used many times in the film to cleanse the characters' sins away. We get hints of incest along the way. Abortion. And even murder. Rain arrives to wash away any bad karma or spiritual residue that had been built up around the immaculate homes and set pieces depicted in the film. It seems to me that every stick of furniture and prop was pulled from a Spiegal Catalog. Clean as a whistle. Every locale in the movie is named or located by a body of water: Warm Springs, Spring Lake, Bar Harbor, to name a few. There was one scene, however, that put everything into proper perspective for me, boiling the love triangle down to a concentrated brew. When Jeanne Crain startles Cornel Wilde, who is hammering away on his typewriter and new novel (as she is tending to roses growing above on a trellis), her appearance is cautiously watchful. Heavenly. She is his angel. Gene Tierney, on his other shoulder, soon arrives via water. She emerges from the dark depths like a sea monster from hell. A beautiful one. Simple metaphor--but effective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nothing if not colorful</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Leave Her to Heaven' is nothing if not colorful. I am of course referring to the richness and saturation of its Technicolor, but also to its depiction of the characters it strives to portray.Famous novelist Cornel Wilde meets and is quickly seduced by the confident and serenely beautiful Gene Tierney. They marry, and soon she meets his doting handicapped kid brother of whom she is instantly jealous, and the janitor at the idyllic cottage in the secluded mountains who is also her husband's best friend. When her mother and adopted sister come visiting her jealousy accelerates.The corniness of the visual style of 'Leave Her to Heaven' is at all times counterbalanced by its steady-eyed focus on the Tierney character's emotional illness. "It's just that she loves too much", her mother explains, but she is clearly more monstrous than just that. The chilling scene where she sits motionless in the boat on the lake, no expression behind her sunglasses, as she watches her disabled brother in-law drown, is unforgettable.Not all of 'Leave Her to Heaven' is on this exalted level, far from it, but it is a more than decent melodrama with lots of well-cast minor characters. Cornel Wilde as the novelist is masculine and cute, and Tierney, who must have empathized more than just a little bit with a character that to some degree mirrored her own psychological problems, looks gorgeous and proves herself an astute actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior Romantic Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Well, I can't say I ordinarily like stories about manipulative women and intrigue and jealousy and all that. Give me blood and guts! There's nothing more stimulating to the glands than seeing Schwarzenegger wrench someone's head out of its socket. But "Leave Her to Heaven" is a cut above the usual romantic dramas. I won't repeat most of the comments that have already been registered except to say that they're all pretty much on the mark. The technicolor photography is magnificent. The scenery is almost as gorgeous as Gene Tierney. Eww, when she emerges from that swimming pool in that one-piece aqua suit. But we kind of expect it from her, so there's little surprise involved in our being stunned by her foxy beauty. (Philip Roth once claimed she must be part Chinese.)Cornell Wilde doesn't exactly perform celluloid magic here, but he is suitably handsome (I guess) and was an interesting guy. Hungarian ethnic background, multilingual, Columbia fencing team (he must have had to unlearn his technique to fence so flamboyantly on screen later), and then those later movies of his -- "The Prey," "Beach Red," maybe examples of overreaching but, still, what ambition they bespeak, and how challenging they are. Chill Wills is a poor folksy mope. Vincent Price is a conventional role as the rejected suitor bringing mixed motives to his prosecution of Wild. The surprise, at least for me, was the appearance and performance of Jeanne Crain, who is not only lovely in her own right, although not in Tierney's celestial league, but extremely appealing. John Stahl may overdue the scene in which she first meets Wilde -- too many reaction shot of her expressing curiosity and attraction towards him. But she is superb in the role of the normal half-sister of Tierney. It's difficult to think of an actress who has projected femininity so effortlessly and so winningly. The scene is which Tierney grills her about her destination is revealing. "Taxco," Crain replies, milking those two unpromising syllables of every melodic quality they possess. And, Taxco indeed. It must be marvelous to be as wealthy as these people. They never go anywhere that's not fashionable. Crain looks like the girl next door, if the girl next door were Jeanne Crain. She's obviously stable, which is nice and comfortable, if you don't like turbulence in your life. Tierney on the other hand is the dark swan. When she sits in that rowboat, motionless, expressionless, her face a mask behind those black shades, and the kid drowns, going under and coming back several times, gulpingly, until he disappears. Some chill! Another point worth mentioning -- because it's treated rather lightly by Stahl -- is how quickly Tierney appropriates Wild as a fiancé. He's obviously interested in her, who wouldn't be, but he hardly knows her. Then, suddenly, she announces their forthcoming marriage, overcoming his bemusement with the force of her will. If you haven't seen this, you'll probably enjoy it if you do.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A strange and morbid melodrama with elements of domestic thriller simply does not fit the imagined scenery. LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN is a movie about a selfish, jealous and probably mentally unstable woman who irresistibly captures the magic of Technicolor. If I made the birth of the present-day conditions and movies, this melodrama to some responded by "inflated" cheap fantasies.In the event that there is a woman "embellished" the above features, it is the essence of a failure. However, I admit that the highlight of the film (the trial) is extremely tense until the very end when everything collapses.Gene Tierney as Ellen Berent Harland is simply faceless in the film. I simply can not see the change in her character. Tierney has a special beauty and it just attracts, but acting is very poor. Jeanne Crain as Ruth Berent is, except at the end of the film, unnoticed and unconvincing. Her character lacks emotion. Complete film lacks emotion. Cornel Wilde as Richard Harland, since the partners in the film, could not have better. Vincent Price as Russell Quinton acts like he's got his 5 minutes of fame and desperately trying to use them as he left a memorable impression.The acting is bad and the characterization is not strong. However, this movie has its value in a solid story and good scenery.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always enjoyed this movie. The technical and production values are very good. The New Mexico home and "Back of the Moon" cabin locations are beautiful. The train sequence captures well the look and colors of the era. I liked the pacing. The melodramatic story was told very cleanly with no "treacly" moments. I thought Jeanne Crain was just right in her figure of a girl of depth who had no need to be noticed as such. And Gene Tierney just continued her mastery of roles of strong and complicated women. The Razor's Edge and Leave Her To Heaven were similar types who became real when Tierney's beauty and sense of character were on view. I like Cornel Wilde in the film. I do think Dana Andrews would have been a good choice. There was always a feeling that Dana Andrews' characters could see more of what was going on in a situation than the other characters. He always seemed like an "author" type to me. He seemed to be seeing without response, or judgment. It was about this time that he did The Best Years Of Our Lives. He is very powerful in that film. Dana Andrews gives the appearance of a man who can surmount problems. I found the demographics of the IMDb raters of this movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Leave her to . . . " WHERE?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this movie--LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN--is somewhat perplexing. It is not readily apparent to whom the "her" refers. If it is the main character of this Psychobabblish flick, Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney), then what the writer MEANT to say (absent 1940s censors) clearly would be "Leave her to Satan," or "Leave her to Hell." Other the other hand, the alternative possible referent is Ellen's conniving cousin\sister, Ruth Berent (Jeanne Crain). Since Ruth gets to live happily ever after with Ellen's husband\widower Dick (Cornel Wilde), it is somewhat questionable at what point she should be "left for heaven." And why is her first degree murder trial being prosecuted by the victim's one-time fiancé Russell (Vincent Price), who pledged to love Ellen "forever"? Even a prosecutor in ancient Rome would have understood the need to recuse himself in such circumstances. And isn't having THREE "Gene's\Jeanne's" (counting Gene Lockhart, who plays Dr. Saunders, Ellen's Ob-Gyn) in the main cast a little redundant?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Noirish melodrama in stunning Technicolor</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Leave Her to Heaven" concerns a writer (Cornel Wilde) who meets and falls in love with a beautiful young socialite (Gene Tierney). Although she's engaged she soon breaks off her engagement in order to marry her new beau. However, all is not well, since her obsessive nature threatens to ruin the lives of both her husband and her own family.The plot's rife with melodrama and while the film exhibits the sensibilities of film noir it's uncharacteristically drenched in the visual splendour of Technicolor. Personally, rather than associating this with film noir (as most do) I see it as prefiguring later movies like "Play Misty For Me" &amp; "Fatal Attraction".Notably, Gene Tierney garnered the only Oscar nomination of her career for her starring role here. While I wasn't completely floored by her performance I'd say that she single-handedly made the film's best scene, which takes place on a lake with her husband's disabled younger brother. Her co-star, Cornel Wilde, makes a reliable leading man and Jeanne Crain delivers the best supporting performance. The always welcome Vincent Price is also present in a smaller role as a jilted lover.As for the direction, John M. Stahl does a fine job but the real highlight of the film's visuals is the vibrant, Oscar-winning Technicolor cinematography. The sumptuous art direction-interior decoration was also recognized with an Oscar nomination. Then there's the mood-enhancing score by nine-time Oscar winner Alfred Newman.Ultimately, the plot of "Leave Her to Heaven" might be a bit on the sensational side but the visuals go a long way in forgiving the script's excesses. I wouldn't recommend it unreservedly but there are definitely aspects of the film deserving high praise.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>May not care for high drama soap, but the exquisite shadow &amp; light play in Technicolor by Oscar-winning cinematographer Leon Shamroy is totally worth it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Leave Her To Heaven" is director John M. Stahl's 1945 unabashed glamorous soap with Gene Tierney as the irresistible beauty, Ellen Berent (out of this worldly on the surface), seemingly innocent of the dark vampiric seed of jealousy wedged beneath. In this script by Jo Swerling, based on Ben Ames Williams' novel, Tierney duly earned her ultimate queen of femme fatales that would succeed in her evil goal pursuit at all costs, even if it means her own demise to ruin all humanity (oh yes, really). Ellen is one determined woman with undying love for the man she chose to own all by herself. (Almost sounds like William Wyler's "The Collector" 1965 - seeing Terence Stamp's hold on Samantha Eggar). Well, she would if she could lock up her husband's heart. This is a soap opera, so other players are involved unawaringly crossing her grand scheme of things. Though she managed to act upon her uncontrollable instincts while murderous dismissals accidentally occur. Heartless? Does she have one? Single-mindedly she loves novelist Richard Harland (played by Cornell Wilde), and 'till death do us part' deadly serious, she is.Others include talented Jean Crain as Ruth Berent, a live-in cousin, who's much more kind-hearted and likable a person yet definitely an uneasy competition from Ellen's perspective. Mary Philips is Mrs. Berent, a recent widow (so Ellen lost her beloved father she's very close to) who's aware but not fully understand why her daughter Ellen 'loves too much'. Vincent Price is Russell Quinton who cannot forget he once wanted to marry Ellen, when she dumped him for Richard, but able to survive the rejection and became a barrister (a conveniently useful occupation in Ellen's mind). Darryl Hickman as Danny Harland, Richard's young brother, enthusiastically fighting for recovery of his physically disabled state, yet viewed as a hindrance to Ellen competing for Richard's attention by the minute.That's just the general structure and character map of the high drama tale. To skip to the appreciation of Leon Chamroy's cinematography mastery, it is also out of this worldly exquisite in this Technicolor vivid movie. The thoughtful application of shadows and lighting directions-angles jump out at me - I marvel at the shadow patterns on the walls, framing of set decorations, and what the camera insightfully captured on screen that enhanced the movie's mood and pacing. At one point, to my surprise while revisiting the film, my eyes caught the shadowy shape on the wall thrown off from Ellen who's standing in front of the fireplace - the figure was likened somehow to a witch with a tall pointy hat - how very clever of Chamroy! She's a witch alright as she was pleading her innocence to the 'mishap' and sorrow that Richard experienced over Danny. Oh, she's only thinking of Richard, she shamelessly professed.Is that half the story yet? Soaps can be long and breath-suspending. Still, plot after plot, the comfortable flowing performances by the cast can arrest your attention and emotional investment. It's a mighty pleasing to look at Hollywood movie (from the Twentieth Century Fox studio), with music score by veteran composer Alfred Newman. The lush production design (by Maurice Ransford, Lyle Wheeler) and richly detailed set design (by Ernest Lansing, Thomas K. Little) with capable editing (by James B. Clark) rendered "Leave Her To Heaven" a definitive soap classic, up in the ranks with Douglas Sirk's "Magnificent Obsession" 1954, the love-wrought dramatic pair of Jane Wyman and Rock Hudson (from Universal Pictures).Gene Tierney's diabolical jealousy-consumed character reminds me of Robert Montgomery's devilish role, similar jealousy and love you to death storyline in director W S Van Dyke's "Rage In Heaven" 1941 (in stark B/W), where Ingrid Bergman and George Sanders are the equivalent in reverse to Cornel Wilde and Jean Crain's pairing, including the involvement of courtroom drama and murderous accusations. It's actually a taut film noir. Robert Montgomery is spectacular as the unsuspecting psychotic one, and Bergman (young at 26) and Sanders' performances match his brilliance just as fine. Stepping back, I rather like this rare gem delivered in 85 minutes with love story and suspenseful last-minute ending, too. I was lucky to catch it on TCM cable.Also comes to mind is 'Amelie' Audrey Tautou in director Laetitia Colombani's "He loves me?he loves me not" 2002 French film, in which Tautou plays a female stalker, home wrecker, sly-lying-unsuspecting troubling young woman, pretty to look at yet psychotic deep down. And British director Roger Michell gave us "Enduring Love" 2004, with Rhys Ifan being the stalker extreme to the couple played by Daniel Craig and Samantha Morton - Ifan is a 'new' friend, unwanted and unable to get rid of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Tierney's performance in Leave Her To Heaven is, indeed, worthy of an Oscar nomination. She leaves everyone else's acting standing in the wings. But then, I have never rated Cornel Wilde particularly, nor Vincent Price in his early days (he was particularly corny in Laura). Jeanne Crain was as sweet as ever, but it is Tierney's film from start to finish. The technicolour was interesting and worthy of a sultry melodrama such as this. But film noir? I don't thin so. I know film noir doesn't have to be in black and white, but the colour didn't help this sort-of noir-ish murder story. Too much colour, not enough drama. Gene Tierney's wide-eyed, or narrow-eyed, expressions, which define the story's development, may punctuate the story, but there's too much daftness ('the girl with the hoe'? Come on...) and Jeanne Crain is too simpery to convince (though maybe she is worthy of Wilde's wooden face). But the film rolled along nicely, with lovely, luxurious, domestic settings, until the courtroom scene, where Vincent Price overplays, and Jeanne Crain is found not guilty on the skimpiest of pretexts. Not convincing.I enjoyed the film, the period stuff, Gene Tierney's loveliness - but potential predatoriness - but, ultimately, it was not as satisfying as I'd hoped. Never mind. At the end of the Second World War, who would have cared?</fullReview>

Wilde is fine as the object of her love, as is Crain, looking quite lovely, as her adopted sister. Price goes a bit over the top as a lawyer.

		<fullReview>I've read a number of comments on this movie and agree we have a fine film here with the most sumptuous photography imaginable. In a different vein I'd like to concentrate on one scene that is so chillingly evil especially when viewed of its time.Gene Tierney's evil wife of Cornel Wilde has had enough of Cornel's little brother...."he is after all a ...cripple" she tells his shocked specialist. So as he won't go live elsewhere she has him killed. How does she do it. She rows out to the middle of the lake and encourages him to swim to the shore. The boy is keen and spunky about the task. She knows he will tire. He does tire, she lifts not a finger to help. That's the bare bones of the scene. The chill is in the details 1. Gene Tierney is beautiful and beautifully shot during this. 2. She wears sunglasses that make it impossible to see her eyes. 3. She watches closely the youngster drown 4. The music stops 5. We watch with her the child coming up for air, crying for help, she remains absolutely still.It is this utter stillness that is so powerful with mostly just the sound of the water and occasional muted cries.Overall I'd have given the film an even higher rating if it hadn't had the happy ending as it was scarcely believable that Gene's sister would be found innocent at the trial, even less so that Cornel's character would risk it all again with another woman from the same f***ed up family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An upper class romance goes all wrong when the wealthy young woman's (Gene Tierney) true psychological condition as a possessive and dangerous neurotic asserts itself. She hides it well but cannot keep it under control once things get to a certain point. Cornel Wilde, as a wealthy intellectual and writer, plays the object of her out of control feelings of which she, he, and the audience believe to be love. In a courtroom trial scene that happens well into the second half of the film, the prosecutor (Vincent Price) hammers away at Wilde about who's in love with who and when. The best scene in the film happens on her adopted family's beautiful New Mexico ranch, as she's both riding a horse and holding an urn and spreading the ashes of her father. This murky back story about her relationship with her father shows that her condition had been developing and worsening over time. The only hole in the story is her ability to conceal from Wilde her true character, and her family, with wealth and brains, who supposedly knows the truth about her, but lets him stroll right into her trap.</fullReview>

On one hand it is an entertaining film which handles the changes in tone quite well, and boasts a solid sense of humor early on, excellent performances, outstanding cinematography, and fairly good direction from John M. Stahl. On the other hand the script is prone to the worst sort of heavy-handed exposition, Danny is an extremely grating character, and the court scenes which come towards the end of the film are often less accomplished than those on your average television courtroom drama.Still, for a movie where (and I don't intend to go into detail as it's fun to see the plot unfold) the events that cause so much misery to the characters are almost hilariously contrived and unnatural, it's still quite a good film, mostly due to the cast, especially Gene Tierney, and the quality of the visuals. There are films more worthy of preservation and restoration, perhaps, but this is still worth seeing on the big screen if you get the chance. Also making the rounds currently is a new print of "Once Upon a Time in the West", ant that is yet another invaluable contribution to film appreciation courtesy of the Film Foundation, which allows us to see films as they should be seen.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent performance from Gene Tierney in a beautiful classic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave Her to Heaven reunites two of the stars from Otto Preminger's masterpiece, Laura. Gene Tierney and Vincent Price both appear in the film, and the fact that Vincent Price is in it is my main reason for viewing. It's disappointing that Price isn't made the lead actor, as that accolade goes to Cornel Wilde. Leave Her to Heaven is a story of love, taking in themes of selfishness and jealousy. It doesn't come close to being as great as the aforementioned Laura, but the film is still a good example of Hollywood's golden era. Gene Tierney stars as Ellen Harland. Women can be jealous at the best of times; but she takes it to a whole new level. After falling in love with writer Richard Harland, jealousy soon takes hold; as she becomes envious of his writing, his brother, her own sister and even a girl he went out with in college. The film follows the pair as her jealousy destroys the relationship. Vincent Price co-stars as Tierney's unfortunate (or fortunate) ex-lover, and although he doesn't make a big appearance in the movie; he makes an impression with the screen time he has.The acting in Leave Her to Heaven is excellent throughout. Gene Tierney gives a powerful performance as the loathsome leading lady. Her understated evil brings just the right aura to the portrayal, and this role really shows her talent as a leading lady. Cornel Wilde's performance is the most downbeat of the film, and although he isn't bad; he doesn't particularly stand out among the rest of the cast. Vincent Price was often typecast as a snide 'gentleman' before he became a horror icon, and his performance here shows him doing that excellently, while hinting at his talent for playing evil characters. The support cast step into their roles nicely, and all give believable performances. The plot is generally well worked, with most of the action coming from their characters and their actions rather than a barrage of plot points. The film is shot in Technicolor, which makes it stand out from a lot of other pictures released around the time this was made. The atmosphere is constantly foreboding, especially early on as Tierney hints at a darker side to her character. I can recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys classics film.</fullReview>

The photography by Leon Shamroy is magnificent because he uses the oppositions of colors. This you can see in the dresses of Gene Tierney. She is splendid in her gowns (costume design by Kay Nelson). The way she is dressed is symbolic for her different moods going from maniac and going wild on her horse during hours or being depressive and sitting silently and sick at home. The first scene of the movie is typical for what is going to happen: she is staring with her splendid green eyes to the person in front of her on the train. She will explain: "You look like my father". The way Vincent Price is confessing his love is responded by her: "Are you menacing me?".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Tierney gives a remarkable performance as Ellen Berent,one of the most malicious characters ever to grace the screen. The film is "Leave Her To Heaven(1945)",an intriguing character study based on a popular novel by Ben Ames Williams.The story begins when Ellen meets author,Richard Harland(Cornel Wilde)on a train. They quickly become well-acquainted and start to fall in love when he visits her in her New Mexican home.It's evident that Ellen's mother and sister(Jeanne Crain)feel she's extremely clinging to people she loves.However,they believe this is out of the goodness of her soul.Ellen's mother even says the memorable line,"There's nothing wrong with Ellen;she just loves too much." Unfortunately,this turns out to be not such a commendable trait. Ellen and Richard quickly get married and move into his summer house, "Back of the Moon." Much to Ellen's dismay,Richard's crippled brother(Daryll Hickman)joins them. Ellen knows her husband wants his family around him and it will never change. However,she wants her husband to herself and will not let anyone stand in her way. John M. Stahl vividly directs this film and uses gorgeous technicolor vistas as a backdrop.While most 40's crime dramas were filmed in black and white,this one is in color,making the story even more chilling.Stahl wanted to convey the message that evil could lurk in beautiful surroundings and in the best of families. The scene where Tierney mercifully watches crippled Hickman drown in a lake,is still one of the most disturbing in American cinema. Gene Tierney gives perhaps her finest performance in the difficult role of a cold and calculating killer.She got an Oscar nomination,but lost out to Joan Crawford's performance as a self-sacrificing mother in "Mildred Pierce." Cornel Wilde is extremely effective as the caring husband,who loves his wife,but isn't too fond of her. Vincent Price has a fascinating supporting role as Tierney's ex-lover and later prosecutor for Wilde. Daryll Hickman is memorable as the innocent victim of one of Tierney's violent acts. The film is similar in symbolic tone to Alfred Hitchcock's classic,"Shadow of a Doubt(1943)",where he used small-town America as a backdrop for the story of murderer on the run. This is another thriller I highly recommend. I give "Leave Her To Heaven" an 8 1/2 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Possibly the Only Noir Done in Technicolor; Tierney is a Revelation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1945 was the year Joan Crawford made a comeback (and won the Oscar) in MILDRED PIERCE. It was also the year when Gene Tierney got her only Oscar nomination, for LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN, a gorgeous Technicolor feast for the eyes that may be the most "noir" film ever made in color.Gene Tierney in 1945 was a major star; the previous year she had made what many consider her signature film: Otto Preminger's noir classic LAURA. Her performance was fine, but the character as written made few demands on her; Laura was more a vision than an actual flesh-and-blood woman. Possibly only a beauty like Tierney could have played such a role, but when LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN came along, she saw a chance to sink her teeth into a role completely opposite to the public's image of her and she grabbed it. And I've always thought she should have beaten Crawford; MP is a good film, and Crawford is good in it, but her greatest work was already behind her and the comeback only held obscurity off temporarily. Tierney, by contrast, was at the peak of her career when she made LHTH, and I would venture to say no one expected what she delivered.Tierney plays socialite Ellen Berend, a woman driven by an obsessive need to possess and own anyone and anything she loves. Her obsessive "love" is so destructive that it ruined her parents' marriage, and she is like a runaway train; anyone who gets in her path is destroyed.Ellen meets writer Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) on a train to a resort in New Mexico. Though engaged to another man, Russell Quinton (Vincent Price), she and Harland soon fall in love and she cruelly jilts Quinton and marries Harland so quickly that her new husband almost does not realize what has happened. He's in for more than a few shocks.The honeymooners make a brief stop at Warm Springs, Georgia, where we meet Dick's teenage brother Danny (Darryl Hickman), who is paralyzed from the waist down but for whom the doctor has hopes of recovery (his condition is never really made quite clear). Dick and Danny adore each other, and when the newlyweds make plans to return to Dick's cottage in Maine called "Back of the Moon," Ellen realizes that Danny will be accompanying them; you can see the thunderclouds cross Tierney's lovely face, and it is a shocker for sure. And there are more shocks in store.Ellen's a monster. She will do anything when she feels threatened, and to her, anything that comes between her and her husband is a threat. And she gets rid of them. One by one.She starts with her young brother-in-law; out on the lake in a rowboat, Danny decides to try to swim to shore and Ellen, knowing he can't possibly make it, simply sits in the boat and watches the kid drown. It is a particularly shocking scene for 1945: the cold-blooded murder of a child. But Ellen is just getting started.Devastated by his brother's death (and not a little suspicious), Dick starts growing distant from Ellen, and she gets the idea that having a baby would bring him back to her. Of course, not halfway through the pregnancy she realizes the baby will be another intrusion, so she throws herself down the stairs and miscarries.The critic Leonard Maltin refers to this film as "slick trash," and I suppose it is, but it's compelling trash. Tierney's murderous rage juxtaposed with her radiant, breathtaking beauty forms the paradox on which the whole film turns. She's brilliant: Ellen is a loathsome creature, but it is easy to see how the people around her get taken in. Only her adopted sister Ruth (Jeanne Crain in the next best performance in the film) sees her for who she is, and makes plans to leave, but does not escape in time.Cornel Wilde's performance is weak tea compared to the rest of the cast. To be fair, the role does not really call for him to do much more than stand there and look pretty, which he does very well, but there are a few moments when one wishes he would have put some more depth into his characterization. After all, Vincent Price manages to upstage Wilde in a role that is little more than a cameo, and when that happens, you've got a problem with your leading man. I must state here that I mean no disrespect to Price: he was a great actor whose versatility was never given its due in Hollywood. Despite an incredible range stretching from light comedy to horror classics, Price often labored unacknowledged. Possibly because he made it all look so easy, as for him it probably was.But this matters little in the end, because this is Tierney's film from start to finish. Taking the role was an act of incredible guts; careers have been destroyed for less. But she not only takes the role, she owns it. It's probably Tierney's finest hour on film.</fullReview>

Tierney is real and believable, dark and mysterious. We are not quite sure what is tormenting her until she is on Lake Bass with young Danny and hesitates to rescue him when he tires of swimming. The audience now sees a dark suspenseful foreshadowing of events to come.Wilde is working on his next book, as best-selling author they have several residences, one in Warm Springs,Georgia and one in New Mexico, as well as Bar Harbor Maine. Some of the sets are beautiful, as the Atlantic Ocean after Tierney has been swimming, after a terrible accident and looks refreshed and resplendent. The Technicolor aquas and corals are also quite notable, and add a touch of exotic to Tierney's already natural beauty.Overall an interesting and intriguing film, the court scenes at the end are tiresome, but Tierney alone is well worth it.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hauntingly gorgeous Gene Tierney shines in this somewhat dry yet gorgeous Technicolor melodrama...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you are in the process of becoming a Gene Tierney fan, then this is the best film for you to start with. After watching this film, you'll never forget Gene's unique and impossible loveliness. With the stunning use of the film's Oscar-winning Technicolor cinematography, Gene Tierney is absolutely breathtaking in this film and has never looked more beautiful on film?especially in her close-ups, when wearing negligee, and when rising out of the surf after a swim in one scene. As with LAURA (1944), her beauty in this film will continue to haunt you for years.As Leonard Maltin so appropriately put it, this film is slick trash?but it all depends on how you view the film. LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN can be considered either as a classic or a very attractive piece of crap. Since I found the plot a bit unbelievable and the film a bit cold, I voted for the latter.Thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor, the film looks gorgeous from beginning to end and is a superb example of the use of Technicolor. Alfred Newman, on of my favorite classic film composers, delivers a memorable music score that relies on timpani beats to heighten the suspense. At least the Technicolor, the music score, and Gene Tierney's complex and riveting Oscar-nominated performance as Ellen Harland?Gene's personal favorite performance?makes the film ascend the level of "crap." But the rest of the performances and characters, except for Vincent Price as a district attorney, strike me as a bit dry and dull and are not in the least bit appealing. Darryl Hickman's character was so annoying with his "gee whiz" persona?if you're like me, you'll be relieved after seeing what Gene Tierney's character does to him in a classic scene.The film-noir plot is unbelievable and could be so easy to parody in a spoof film today, but the film almost never borders on camp due to the somewhat dry acting and directing. Gene Tierney's role is preposterous but absolutely convincing?she must've had fun playing the manipulative, cunning Ellen Harland?and she is absolutely perfect for the role. It's a fascinating performance that shows us that there might be something not quite well underneath such a gorgeous exterior. But I'm on the side of Ellen Harland when it comes to her motives?I don't think of Ellen as an evil, wicked character. According to Gene Tierney, it is quite possible that Ellen Harland is undoubtedly insane. Too bad Tierney didn't win the Best Actress Oscar for this fascinating, disturbing performance?instead Tierney lost to the not-so-attractive Joan Crawford for her performance in MILDRED PIERCE.The film is Technicolor eye candy at best...with a heavenly Gene Tierney at the wheel and delivering a fascinating performance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Tierney makes a delectable villainess</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wow, is this some film. Now considered a film noir, [Gene Tierney in yet another one - remember LAURA?] it absolutely tells the tale of a woman who would stop at nothing to hold her man. Based on the famous novel by Ben Ames Williams, it truly captures the mood it is intended to do. Gorgeous technicolor of the era of romantic films and stars, it still holds up as one of the better ones of it's time. Miss Tierney, is perfection to watch on the screen, in black or white [remember her in RAZOR'S EDGE] but in color she is exquisite with her soft complexion, incredible blue/green eyes and flaxen hair. I love this movie. The stars, Miss Tierney, Cornel Wilde [in a remarkably quiet and reserved performance which suits the role] and Jeanne Crain as the innocent sister [and she ain't bad looking either] give wonderfully shaded performance thanks to the director John Stahl and the camera work on location. Miss Tierney was nominated for an Oscar for this one.Who can forget that cover image on the novel? The woman reaching up to heaven? It's even used in the titles of the movie. That image tells a lot as does the film itself. You must see this one. It was made in the era of great stars and great beauty. And certainly Gene Tierney fits the bill in this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first Fatal Attraction..with a terrible ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm always interested in Gene Tierney so this one was an easy choice to watch.Right off, the majority of the film is just a shocker. When you start to realize that she's a little psycho, if your like me, you'll flashback to Glenn Close and Fatal Attraction. Except this one was 42 years earlier. There are so many moments that reminded me of it that it seemed spooky.This film is gene Tierney's all the way. She does a great job to say the least. If you go into this and think your gonna see Rebecca of Sunnybrook Farm...think again. Although Cornell Wilde and Jeanne Crain are in this, they never really had a chance in terms of "spotlight". Tierney's character will just mesmerize you on how unstable she is.That's not to say this film doesn't have flaws. The ending is just absolutely ridiculous and just implausible. Where in this country do they get a DA to try a case who's an actual part of the background of the case? I know of no judge who would permit it. They call that conflict of interest. But, the show goes on. Vincent price goes into parts of their background and it's totally irrelevant. This ending came damn close to almost ruining it for me. I held on though.Don't let my assessment of the ending ruin it for you though. The film in itself is really good. You'll get to see a real psycho from years back. Long before it was fashionable. So grab the DVD, strap yourself in and watch Tierney put on a show.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Technicolor melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am an unconditional fan of Gene Tierney. I have never seen this actress in a film where I didn't like her. Whether it be in the magnificent "Heaven can Wait", the dark "Laura", the mystifying" Whirlpool" , the brilliantly witty "The Ghost and Mrs Muir" or the sumptuous "Leave Her to Heaven", she scores a hit with me every time. The film is beautifully shot - every picture is perfect with regards to lighting and detail. The choice of sets is exquisite. Can someone please explain why the picture quality of films today is less good than the Technicolor of many years ago. It is an absolute mystery. I agree that picture quality is not everything but it DOES go a hell of a long way towards making a film more pleasurable to view. Gene Tierney therefore carries the role of Ellen to perfection in this film. I come well down on her side despite many others trying to portray her as the psychotic and the villain. But the big question is : where does jealousy and possessiveness start and stop ? How long should you let family and relations invade your private life when you are married. You belong to your partner and they belong to you. It is a special relationship and any outside interference, be it from family or friends is a threat to your breathing space and your freedom of action. Of course this doesn't necessarily mean that you need to resort to murder ( or rather not murder, but letting someone die without helping them, whatever you call that ) or having a deliberate accident to kill your progeny. Of course the situation in the film is exaggerated to arouse the spectator's interest, but Ellen's attitude is not as shocking as all that. Especially as her husband ( Cornel Wild ) comes over as a BLAND WIMP ! Jeanne Crain ( Ruth ) pretty though she was, would have done better to scarper and leave them to it. The only one I felt sorry for was poor Danny who died ( I will not say "was murdered" ) in the lake. I think he got more than he deserved. But to me the real guilty party was Cornel Wild who did not love his wife enough, did not give her the passion she needed, and thus exacerbated her jealousy with the results we know. A very interesting film then, all the more so over and above its plastic beauty. Freely available on DVD in Europe. Its title has been translated into French as "Péché Mortel" ( Mortal Sin ).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Leave Her To Heaven' is too often unfairly dismissed as a trashy 1940's melodrama. Yes, this is a glossy spectacle rooted in melodrama with a far-fetched plot, but it's also engrossing entertainment. Look beneath the surface and you will find a multi-layered, thought-provoking film. Not quite a masterpiece, but very, very good. This melodrama/noir could well be the forerunner to such modern soaps 'Days Of Our Lives' and 'The Young And The Restless', with plots involving beautiful females, complicated family situations and intertwining romantic plots.Gene Tierney's portrayal of Ellen Berent Harland is one of the most memorable, ambiguous performances brought to the screen. Gene earned her sole career Oscar nomination (why only one?) as the stunning Ellen Berent, who meets writer Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde)on a train and lures him into marriage only a few days. Ellen is disturbingly obsessive about Richard from the start, but it is only after they are married for a while that he starts to realize that he has married a psychologically unstable woman. Insanely jealous of anyone who seems to come between her and her man, Ellen is willing to kill to keep her husband always by her side.Often referred to as a colour noir, Tierney's character can be described as a femme fatale. She is in control yet dangerous, beautiful but destructive and dominates over her weaker husband. Cornel Wilde is suitably ordinary as Richard, who must be one of the biggest 'suckers' brought to the screen. Tierney kills her unborn baby and watches her husband's disabled brother drown unmercifully yet Richard only has suspicions until later. These suspicions are tied in with his growing affection for Ellen's 'nice girl' cousin Ruth (Jeanne Crain) who is the complete opposite of Ellen. Or is she? Ruth certainly has a strong will hidden by her seemingly sweet demeanor. She shows a ghostly Ellen-like assuredness in the trial sequence when she makes the extraordinary pronouncement about Richard, 'I think I've always loved him'.Filmed in marvellous Technicolor, the visuals are bright but breathtaking.The stunning scenery somehow perfectly complements the plot, which is typical of a woman's melodrama. Tierney herself looks equally stunning, and those three different scenes of her in swimming costumes are certainly not by chance! Tierney gives a stunning performance to match her beauty, it is direct and not overly influenced by acting technique. Tierney's portrayal of an obsessed woman is one of the best brought to the screen in the 40's. The scene in which she watches her brother-in-law drown is one of the most memorable in cinema.It is also interesting to look at Stahl's characterization of Tierney. She is the aggressor in the relationship, swimming up like a shark to Wilde, then later declaring 'I'll never let you go'. Tierney's unique dramatic power, her hauntingly blank gaze, is used to full effect here.The film is influenced, however, by the Freudian perspective that was growing popular in the 40's. Are Ellen's actions motivated by some deep childhood experience and her unusual relationship with her father? This is never fully explained, yet the incestuous element is hard to ignore. Ellen's interest in Richard is first awakened solely by the fact that he bears a resemblance to her now-dead father. Throughout the film, Ellen's relationship with her dad is hinted at, particularly in the shockingly suggestive scene where Richard looks on as Ellen scatters Daddy's ashes while on horseback. Ellen's mother reveals later that Ellen just 'loved her father too much'. Just how much is the question, yet the Freudian angle would certainly explain why the gorgeous Tierney is so attracted to the ordinary Wilde. Also worth taking note of is the title 'Leave Her To Heaven', taken from Shakespeare's Hamlet, a play that was being re-assessed in the 40's during the Freudian vogue. As Hamlet has a deep, strange bond to his mother, Ellen does with her father.The subject matter of this film has lost some of it's impact over the years, but one imagines what the public's reaction to it and Tierney's 'bad girl' role would have been like in the mid-forties. It was a big hit, and scored Oscar noms, but the darkness of Ellen's deeds would surely have put many viewers off. Ellen is not entirely without sympathy though. When she gets married to her husband she naturally wants an uninterrupted honeymoon, but Richard insists on taking his crippled brother along to 'Back Of The Moon' and having Ellen's relatives (who she clearly doesn't like) visit her. The woman is psychologically not all there, and we wonder if this results from some sort of compulsive disorder. My mother's own simplistic view of Ellen 'she's just plain evil' would be shared by many viewers, but I believe there is more to it.Vincent Price has a small role as the fiancé Ellen jilted for Richard, Russell Quinton. He chews up the courtroom scene where Ellen's actions are finally revealed. The film-makers make good use of his charismatic verbal delivery in this sequence. The ending is ultimately unsatisfying, it is one of those tacked-on, happy conclusions that feel forced in a noir piece. Other than that, 'Leave Her To Heaven' certainly satisfied my expectations and then some.9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was obviously an A+ movie. The production values, the lush Technicolor, the vibrant music, the sets, costumes, etc. What I found lacking in this spectacle was the casting. Of course, Gene Tierney turned in a pretty good performance but I found the rest of the cast second rate. Jeanne Crain was okay but Cornell Wilde as Richard added very little to the production besides making some scenes rather stilted and downright awkward. Why gorgeous Ellen found anything to make her fall madly in love with him remains a mystery. It would have been nice to see a cast up to the standards with the rest of the movie.As for Ellen's mental state, the audience is left to fill in the blanks on their own for the movie never addresses why she, first of all "loves too much" (what does that mean?) Why/how she ruined her mother's life, why Ellen must be alone with her husband at all times (he's certainly not Mr. Excitement). The story basically says, "She's crazy, just accept that." Perhaps that was the style back in 1945 but I found it rather jarring to have no explanation for her actions besides a little hint here and there from her mother. It sounds like there was a lot more background that either got deleted or ended up on the cutting room floor.This is a good movie, worth the price of admission for seeing the boat scene alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Technicolor; Disturbing Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Called trashy melodrama by some critics, "Leave Her to Heaven," the story of a demented woman and the husband who becomes trapped in her web of possession, insanity, and murder, is trash at its zenith, a prime example of 1940s studio opulence. This film noir, told in extended flashback as the husband (Wilde) returns home from an unjust prison term, is unusual in that it is in vibrant Technicolor rather than the genre's usual black-and-white. But the contrast between visual brilliance and psychosis enhances the horror. In her autobiography, Gene Tierney wrote that she had wanted to play Ellen Berent ever since she read Ben Ames Williams's novel. She worked well with John Stahl, and "blossomed under his direction." Besides the sets at Twentieth Century-Fox, filming was done on location in Arizona, northern California, and Georgia. The real star of the film may be Leon Shamroy's Technicolor cinematography, which earned the picture its only Academy Award and is still beautiful sixty years later.The recent Fox Studio Classics DVD release of "Leave Her to Heaven" contains an excellent transfer of the restored film, relevant contemporary newsreels, a restoration comparison, and commentary by supporting actor Darryl Hickman and critic Richard Schickel. Both Hickman and Schickel offer interesting insights, but each is sometimes condescending toward the acting talents of Tierney, Wilde, and particularly Crain. Inexplicably and inexcusably, Schickel repeatedly pronounces director Stahl's name "Sphal."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Tierney couldn't be more beautiful. . . or more evil in this visually appealing melodrama. Photographed gloriously, Tierney was never more lovely on film, nor did she ever give a finer performance. Her Ellen is dark, desperate, but compelling. Tierney gives us hints at her imbalance from the opening scene, and gradually escalates to full-blown wild-eyed jealous madness. Genuinely disturbing at times, Tierney uses her impassive feline face and narrow eyes to great effect, most The movie pulls out all the stops....almost anything one might imagine a jealous wife to do, Ellen does. Jeanne Crain, convincingly spunky and cute as Ellen's cousin Ruth, and Cornel Wilde as husband Dick, make sympathetic if comparatively bland heroes. The cloying character of Dick's hapless brother Danny grates a bit - - one almost roots for Ellen. Some stunning outdoor scenes. Overall, a fun, almost campy film with great production values and a standout performance by Gene Tierney.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...but if you try enough, you can cause to the object of your desire a lot of suffering and torment.Gene Tierney, the most beautiful villainess on the screen in "Leave Her to Heaven" (1945) is ready to destroy herself if it causes her husband whom she madly loves to suffer. What a killer combination of divine beauty and insane possessive jealousy that would hurt even beyond the grave.There are many reasons to see this stylish, well written and acted thriller/noir/drama. One of them is the astounding Oscar winning color cinematography by legendary Leon Shamroy who had been nominated for an Oscar 18 times - more than any other DP. He won four Oscars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although a few "prestige" actresses (Bette Davis among them) continued to play "vixen" roles, during WWII most of Hollywood's leading ladies were presented as the sort of woman a solider could dream about: whether bouncy like Betty Hutton or glamorous like Joan Crawford, they were good-hearted, dependable, and waiting for the boys to come home. Then in 1945 one of Hollywood's most beautiful leading ladies played a role that undercut the girl next door with an ax, and after that nothing would be quite the same.Seen within the context of its times, it is easy to understand why LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN was one of the great shockers of its day. Based on a popular novel by Ben Ames Williams, the film tells the story of Ellen Berent, a woman who seems absolutely flawless in every way imaginable: she is beautiful, intelligent, and of good social background. But she is also a psychopath who marries novelist Richard Harland (Corniel Wilde) because he looks a bit like her dead father, to whom she had an obsessive attachment--and once married she determines to have him completely to herself, even if that means destroying any one with the slightest claim on his affections.Seen today, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN has a clunky feel to it: the script has all the nuance of a wrecking ball in full swing. But the film still fascinates by virtue of the visual beauty (it won an Oscar for color cinematography) that overlays its very direct story of darkest evil, with Gene Tierney's performance as Ellen the pivotal point. Tierney was never more breath-takingly beautiful, and although her performance lacks nuance it is surprisingly powerful in its simplicity. While we might dismiss the film in comparison to such recent and similar shockers as FATAL ATTRACTION, it is impossible to dismiss the vision of such physical loveliness as a mask for darkest evil; the scene in which she allows a child to drown, for example, is justly famous, simply filmed in a beautiful setting in full day light, with Tierney's beautiful face suddenly mask-like, implacable. The film is dated, yes, and greatly flawed--but it remains memorable to this day.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Plodding, phony, and misogynistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had some energy it could at least be camp, but it is as portentous as they come, with a score that goes heavy on percussion (boom...boom...) whenever Gene Tierney's Ellen turns into Devil Woman. We are told that Ellen loved her father so much that "he couldn't call his soul his own" and that it broke up her parents' marriage. Well, come on! What is this but an inside-out way of saying that the father had too much interest in the daughter? Whether the relationship was actually incestuous or not, such undue closeness is the fault of the parent, not the child. Today we know this, but at the time the movie was made an adult could escape responsibility by labelling the child as unnatural, precocious, etc. In this fashion, Ellen is made into a vixen who ruined her father's and mother's lives and then wants to ruin her husband's (she married him because he looked just like her father) when he wants to live a normal life and not be in an obsessive, cloistered relationship with Ellen.Though made in 1945, this movie is utterly Fifties in its lush colour, misogyny, and materialism. The hero says he thought of being a painter but gave it up when he went to Paris and saw that painters lived in unpleasant garrets. (In the film's one, bizarrely anomalous attempt at sophisticated wit, he says that he discovered he was colour blind, but "that didn't matter because I was interested in the post-Impressionists"!) Ellen's rich rival is nicknamed "the gal with the hoe" because she likes gardening, but all we see her doing is shopping--no job, not even charity work. The settings are uniformly tasteful and look so new as to be unreal. Even a courtroom is a spic-and-span huge room in then-fashionable Early American but with arsenic-green walls and brilliant white woodwork. The spectators are so polite (or sedated) that they remain silent or just murmur quietly, even when revelations are made that in other movies of the time (I am not judging them by present mores) would have them shrieking and gasping. Indeed, the demeanour of all the actors throughout the film is wooden, as if the chilling Fifties fear of saying a wrong word and being taken for a Communist or a nonconformist had already crept in.As if the boom-boom isn't enough, the direction underlines everything and then rings it in red. At the beginning, Gene Tierney stares fixedly at Cornel Wilde for several minutes while he coughs, smiles nervously, looks away, etc., and then asks him if she was staring. Toward the end, she chatters away, asking him several questions, and it is only after a few minutes go by in silence that she asks if anything is wrong. Also at the beginning, Wilde returns to his old home, and, to show us that he is considered a pariah, the locals turn up their noses, fall silent, look away, shudder, look at the ground--they do everything but ring a little bell and cry, Unclean! Great to look at Tierney and Jeanne Crain. but the psychotic Ellen (and even back then, wouldn't someone in the family, certainly her husband, have considered her a suitable case for treatment?) is no nuttier than the ambiance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gene Tierney gives a lethal, Oscar-nominated performance in this lush drama (by Jo Swerling, from the Ben Ames Williams novel) about a woman who has to have what she wants , they way she wants it...or else. At first meeting, Ellen Berent (Tierney) and Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) are just two strangers on a train. Although cool and aloof at first, Ellen soon warms up to Harland when she realizes he's the author of the book she's so thoroughly engrossed in. Harland soon joins Ellen's family at their Maine summer house, where he meets Ellen's cousin, Ruth (Jeanne Crain), a quiet contrast to the emotional, temperamental Ellen. Afterwards, Ellen and Richard marry, but when others start taking Richard's attention away from Ellen (including his crippled kid brother, Danny), she gets even. A very adult soap opera that delivers, despite the clichéd melodramatics that almost sink this sumptuous production. With a first-rate score by Alfred Newman, Art Direction-Set Decoration by Maurice Ransford and Lyle R. Wheeler and Oscar-winning cinematography by Leon Shamroy, "Leave Her to Heaven" is a vivid, breathtaking spectacle. Also, watch for the bone-chilling scene on the lake! ***</fullReview>

The Film Starts Out at an Even Pace and then Accelerates as it Draws You Into a Web of Bizarro Land Film-Noir that is Usually Filled with Shadows of Ominous Black, White, and Grey. But the Contrast here Belies its Genre with a Colorful Palette. There is Very Little Mystery here as the Terror and Tension is known Almost Immediately and it is a Place of the most Personal Nightmares. The Ending is so Bad and Ill Thinking and Vincent Price's Shouting Every Word in the Courtroom Scene just about Sinks all of the Weighty Things that Came Before.But this Entertainment was so Unsettling and Unexpected in a Color Romantic Movie that Naive Audiences might have been Quite a Taken Back by a Certain Dismaying Edge that the Film Delivered and Nothing, no Matter how Ridiculous could Damage the Impact of this Almost Forgotten Thriller.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>By Love Possessed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN (20th Century-Fox, 1945), directed by John M. Stahl, stars Gene Tierney (1920-1991) in what was to become her only Academy Award nominated screen role. Although the mystery, LAURA (1944), opposite Dana Andrews, Clifton Webb and Vincent Price, is regarded her most celebrated film, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN proved to be a worthy follow-up, in fact, a far more challenging part for young Tierney in a story based on Ben Ames Williams best seller of a young girl who ruins the lives of those around her. The story opens in Deer Lake, Maine, where Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde) returns after serving a two year prison sentence. Glen Robie (Ray Collins), a family attorney and close friend, relates Harland's circumstance to Bedford (Addison Richards) and how it led him to prison. Told via flashback, on a train bound for New Mexico, finds Richard, a celebrated author, seated across from an attractive woman (Gene Tierney) reading his latest novel, "Time Without End." After making a brief acquaintance, they both meet again at the station platform where Richard, greeted by Glen, is introduced to friends, Ellen Berent, the girl on the train, Ruth (Jeanne Crain), a cousin by adoption, and her mother (Mary Phillips), before heading to Rancho Jacinto. Because Richard bears a striking resemblance to her recently deceased father, Ellen becomes fascinated by him. Within a few days, Ellen proposes to Richard, regardless of the fact she's already engaged to politician, Russell Quinton (Vincent Price). Taking up residence at an isolated lodge in Warm Springs, Georgia, as arranged by Ellen so they could live to themselves, it would be a matter of time before Richard comes to realize the woman he married isn't what she appears to be after all. In spite of her evil methods of doing away with those who get in her way, Robie explains, at the conclusion of his story, why Richard was the one with the prison term. In a role that would have been typically enacted by Barbara Stanwyck, Bette Davis or Ida Lupino, resident bad girls of the screen, this 20th Century-Fox production certainly must have come as a surprise with the casting of Gene Tierney against type. The fact that her facial appearance resembling that of a cat with expressive blue eyes and jealous nature makes her perfectly suited as Ellen Berent. Ellen, who never loses, does everything else in the story except hump her back and hiss out a big growl. Aside from sporting shoulder length hair style made famous by 40s gals, Veronica Lake or Ella Raines, Tierney adds that certain flavor as sweet on the outside and evil on the inside. Under Stahl's expert direction, Tierney does it with such conviction. Interestingly, she never had the opportunity in playing such unsympathetic characters like Ellen again. Others members of the cast worth noting are: Gene Lockhart (Doctor Saunders); Reed Hadley (Doctor Mason); Chill Wills (Leick Thorne); Grant Mitchell and Milton Parsons. While movies tend to have notable lines ("Surely the truth is wicked") and memorable scenes, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN contains several of the latter, including Ellen's (Tierney) spreading her father's ashes at sunrise while riding on horseback; her motionless reaction and method of doing away with her husband's crippled younger brother, Danny (Darryl Hickman); the "accidental" staging leading to the death of her unborn baby; and the destruction of the lives of both her husband and cousin with the belief of them becoming romantically involved. With Cornel Wilde's Richard bearing a physical resemblance to Ellen's father, it is Wilde who at times resembles that of Tierney's LAURA co-star, Dana Andrews. Vincent Price, through his small role, stands out with his courtroom scene through his questioning of the accused victims (Wilde and Crain) in a murder trial. While it is explained earlier in the story of Crain's character being that of Ellen's adopted "cousin," the courtroom segment finds Price labeling her as Ellen's "sister."Placed on home video in 1995 and later DVD, LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN has turned up on cable television throughout the years on American Movie Classics, the Fox Movie Channel and finally Turner Classic Movies where it premiered August 14, 2010. Categorized as a "film noir," LEAVE HER TO HEAVEN comes closer to being in the "soap-opera" classification. Along with its fine acting and interesting story that holds interest for nearly two hours, the film also benefits from its crisp Technicolor photography, location filming (Arizona, Bass Lake and northern California); and that "bang the drum slowly" underscoring.

		<shortDescription>Not quite heavenly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When first we meet novelist Richard Harland it's immediately clear something quite terrible has befallen him. He has the look of a broken man. We're told he just got out of jail after serving two years. From there the film unfolds in one big flashback. What went wrong in this man's life? Unsurprisingly it involves a woman. We see how Richard met the beautiful Ellen Berent. And then we see the catastrophic effect Ellen had on poor Richard's life. How did this handsome, successful author end up in prison? And is it possible going to prison was actually the least of Richard's troubles? What starts out as a happy romance leads to almost incomprehensible tragedy. Ellen Berent turns out to be the most fatal of femme fatales.Leave Her to Heaven is an odd movie in some ways. It's a film noir which unfolds not in black-and-white but in dazzling Technicolor, not in dark city streets but in the great outdoors. The settings may be bright and beautiful but the story certainly is not. This is noir at its darkest. Initially Ellen seems charming. She's clearly smart, stunningly beautiful. It's easy to see how she could draw Richard in. But her possessiveness and insane jealousy drive her mad. She wants Richard all to herself, much as she once wanted her father all to herself. Yes, this is a girl with serious daddy issues. Her anxieties and obsessions ultimately manifest themselves in the cruelest of ways. It's an interesting story but a thoroughly depressing one.Gene Tierney comes across somewhat cold in playing Ellen but that fits, the character is a frosty ice queen. More troubling is the performance of Cornel Wilde whose portrayal of Richard suffers from a severe personality deficit. There's very little life to him, no spark at all. In moments where Richard should be overcome with grief or rage we get very little out of Wilde. On the other end of the spectrum we get entirely too much emotion out of Vincent Price. He plays aspiring district attorney Russell Quinton, who is Ellen's fiancée when Richard first meets her. Ellen immediately dumps Russell and proposes marriage to Richard whom she barely knows. You'd think this would raise some red flags for Richard but no. Of course Russell is quite displeased by this turn of events. He'll have his opportunity for revenge later. Since we know from the beginning Richard is going to jail it's not giving much of anything away to say there's a big courtroom scene late on in the film. And this scene, thanks largely to Price, drives the movie completely off the rails. Price's over-the-top histrionics are laughable. Truly terrible acting making for absolutely excruciating viewing. It's a big letdown at the end of a film which all in all is a bit disappointing. The story is at times quite plodding. Ellen, the key character, is completely detestable. Wilde disappoints and Price threatens to sink the whole production by himself. Tierney is solid if somewhat distant. Probably the best performance in the film actually comes from Jeanne Crain playing Ellen's adoptive sister Ruth. But Crain has a mere supporting role, it's really up to Tierney and Wilde to carry the film. Tierney may have been up to it but Wilde gives her so little help. As a film noir Leave Her to Heaven stands out much more for its uniqueness than its actual quality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a film that demands a little patience at the beginning - at least it did for me. I expected another, by-the-numbers drama/romance, but it gradually becomes more intriguing as the story unfolds. I love the old black and white noir films, and the glorious Technicolor gives the impression, at first, that this isn't real noir.Gene Tierney portrays a woman who is warm, loving, vulnerable, jealous and cold-hearted with equal measure, to the extent that it is hard to decide if she is good or bad at times - I felt a degree of sympathy for her actions - the clinging, younger brother annoyed me almost as much as he did her! A minor point: The train carriage, at the beginning, looks luxurious beyond measure - Is first class travel still that good in the States? A crying shame if it isn't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tierney and Price Steal the Show</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leave Her to Heaven (1945) *** (out of 4) A not-so-typical film-noir about a man (Cornel Wilde) who meets the woman of his dreams (Gene Tierney) only to have his life disrupted due to her loving him too much and leading to some insane jealousy. When one thinks film-noir they really don't think of color movies but I guess this film is the exception as we get that dark and seedy female character but here we get to see her in some beautiful Technicolor by Leon Shamroy who would end up winning an Oscar for his cinematography here. The film has gained a large following over the years but the first hour really left me bored and I had quite a difficult time getting involved in anything going on. The build up on the romance felt very dry to me and it felt as if it went on for way too long. The first hour really drug on for me but the final fifty-minutes are pure mayhem and brilliance with some very chilling moments. I won't ruin what happens but the scene with the crippled brother swimming is still rather shocking to watch so I can't even imagine how it would have played in a much safer 1945 era. There's another sequence involving some steps that is equally as powerful and shocking. Tierney, receiving her only Oscar nomination here, does a marvelous job at playing the beautiful, full of life character at the start of the film and her descent to madness is very believable and perfectly done. That evil look in her eye is perfect and I really loved the way she could turn to pure ice at the drop of a hat. Wilde is very good in his role as well as is Jeanne Crain as the step-sister. Vincent Price eats up the scenery at the end as the D.A. who goes after a certain person and he is wonderfully entertaining. The performances and the final fifty-minutes really makes this film worth viewing but I still wish the first hour had been more compelling. The melodrama of the first half isn't nearly as strong as everything that would follow but the performances and the shocking nature of the second half makes this a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a Closer Look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first 20 minutes may be the most visually exquisite in Hollywood history. Whatever else, cinematographer Shamroy richly deserved his Oscar. The compositions and colors are simply breathtaking, a feast for the eyes. Leonard Maltin calls the production "slick trash". But that slickness amounts to a triumph of studio artistry in direction (Stahl), set decoration, art direction, plus the myriad other phases of film production. Rarely did studio product in its assembly line format reach this level of accomplishment. Calling it "slick", however, suggests nothing more than well-done artifice, when in fact this is one of those rare instances when Hollywood's technicians moved from the merely professional to the sublime.I don't know if there's anything profound in the story line. But, calling the film "trash" suggests a bias against subject matter that smacks of what some would call "soap opera". Of course, aspects of the story do suggest the emotional entanglements of traditional soaps. Nonetheless, the many elements can't be reduced to that banal level. To me, Ellen (Tierney) comes across as some kind of dark Greek goddess, especially when she wears her stone face. Allowing Danny to thrash around while staring impassively from behind dark glasses suggests an Olympian detachment from the concerns of mere mortals. She's like a statue staring with sightless eyes, creating one of the most memorable scenes of the studio era. Also richly evocative are those soaring rock spires and stony buttes from scenic Sedona and a perfect setting for Ellen. They suggest an ethereal, other-world backdrop to the otherwise humdrum family activities. No wonder Ellen feels at home there. And when Richard stands elevated with her against a long horizon, it's a sublime moment of more than just picturesque quality. It almost seems as if she stands at the intersection of two worlds, never fully a part of either.In fact, it's as if Ellen too is ruled by dark fate. She occasionally regrets her actions, yet can't seem to help herself and what she does. Then too, that attachment to Dad brings in a kinky aspect heightened by Richard's (Wilde) resemblance to him. In that sense, when she jilts Russell (Price), she does so in order to marry her father, thereby adding a rich layer of weird psychology to the mix. And when her ashes are finally mingled with her father's, she achieves a kind of lifelong consummation. At the same time, it's logical and fitting that the two should finally merge with Sedona's ethereal landscape and whatever lies beyond. But, if there's a heaven she's being left to, it's definitely not the usual one. No doubt about it, Ellen is one of the most memorably suggestive characters from Hollywood's so-called Golden Era.The striking Gene Tierney is simply excellent as Ellen. Even the usually wooden Wilde appears well cast, and when the two meet in the train, it's like the meeting of two gorgeous manikins. Only Crain as the sweet sister Ruth has what appears a clichéd role. I guess my only reservation is with the courtroom scenes, which lack the imagination and flair of the movie as a whole. Anyway, rarely did classic Hollywood treat a lead character's perverse obsession in such an uncompromising manner, while it's to TCF's credit that they would risk an up-and- coming young actress in such a demanding role. And, for once, that studio's abiding concern with glamorous women and big production really paid off. No, the movie is not trash, not even slick trash. Instead it's first-rate noir of a special kind. Instead of couching noir elements of dark psychology and the hand of fate in low-key shadow, this one is couched in sunshine and nature. But enough of the essentials are present. Richard's main flaw is to fall for Ellen's mask-like beauty, while Ellen's is to confuse physical resemblance with inner resemblance-- in fact Richard is really an ordinary guy unlike her mysterious father. Yet neither can seem to help what they do. What's unusual is that Ellen appears not merely a victim of noir's dark fate but to be in some odd way a partial inhabitant of the same metaphysical plane. In short, this is a noir with an other-worldly connotation. It's also a noir that surpasses the conventions of soap opera, despite Leonard Maltin's summary dismissal. Above all, it's one of the exotic crown jewels of the studio era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Based on the best-selling novel by Ben Ames Williams, 'Leave Her To Heaven' is a stylish psychological thriller starring Gene Tierney as 'Ellen', the stunningly beautiful wife of handsome writer 'Richard Harland', played by Cornel Wilde. Ellen panics as her perfect marriage unravels and Harland's work and invalid brother demand more and more of his attention. Her husband becomes unnerved by her compulsive and jealous behavior. And, when the people close to him are murdered, one by one, it is obvious that this dream marriage has become a full-fledged nightmare," according to the film's official synopsis.This most obvious aspect of this melodrama is its stunning color cinematography, which won an "Academy Award" for Leon Shamroy. Also, there were "Oscar" nominations for the likewise stunningly beautiful Ms. Tierney, plus notices for "Art Direction" and "Sound". Director John M. Stahl gets excellent work from his crew, including names like Alfred Newman, Fred Sersen, and Lyle Wheeler. Too bad there wasn't more than a fleeting moment of "Poor dear" Mae Marsh, seen in the opening.Tierney's performance seems too posed, at times; but, she is psychotically entertaining, and certainly enhances the picture. As her wide-eyed prey, Mr. Wilde and rival Jeanne Crain (as Ruth Berent) are as appropriately bland as Vincent Price (as Russell Quinton) and Mary Philips (as Mrs. Berent) are appropriately theatrical. Not quite stealing the picture, but swimmingly taking aim, young Darryl Hickman (as Danny Harland) is an impossibly cheerful polio victim. That the film can be turned inside-out gives it an appealing surreal quality. Color-enhanced pictures tell lies; there is something dark beneath the surface.******** Leave Her to Heaven (12/19/45) John M.

		<shortDescription>Gorgeous but overdone melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm with the "slick, beautifully-done melodrama" camp on this one. I agree with other posters that the direction was not the best: Jeanne Crain was so sickly sweet, as she was in many of her movies, that I felt like I needed an insulin shot every time she came on screen. In addition, much of the acting was stylized, as in the scene where Jeanne Crain &amp; Cornel Wilde are returning to the house after a shopping trip, and their purchases fall out of the box and start blowing around in the wind; also when Jeanne Crain is posing in the nursery, wearing a clown hat, while Richard paints the image in a mural on the wall. And the final scene -- where Richard arrives home after being in prison and embraces Ruth -- approaches parody, with the posture of Jeanne Crain, the sunset in the background and the swelling music. Corny is the word that comes to mind! Vincent Price, one of my favorite actors, was really over the top in the courtroom scenes. And it was a little hard to believe that he wouldn't have been forced to recuse himself from the case, given the fact that Ellen was his ex-fiancée and that one of the key defense witnesses was Wilde, who stole Ellen away from him! All that being said, this movie is a big favorite of mine! I like the scene where poor Danny is going down for the third time, and Ellen, hearing Richard approaching, jerks off her sunglasses to reveal cold, narrowed eyes in a face devoid of humanity, before she dives into the lake in a phony "rescue" attempt. Chilling. And Mary Philips, as Mrs. Berent, gives a good performance, I think. She sees what Ellen is, to a certain extent, but can't change her, or the family dynamic; she has a "beaten-down" quality, and her sadness and resignation are apparent.I highly recommend this movie as a guilty pleasure.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My brief review of the film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film looks wonderful, with excellent lighting choices and rich colours, giving the material an appropriate style for film noir in colour. The screenplay is however quite poorly written, with events dragged out at an inappropriately slow pace, and a story that is dead-on predictable by the standards today. In its day, the plot was rather unique to have in a film, but there is nothing much good left in it for viewers who have been exposed to story lines like it many times before. Some situations also lack credibility, and the acting is not too hotshot either. With some good selections of sound recording too, this is certainly an impressive film on a technical scope, but I did not find the overall product very satisfying. Maybe in 1945 I would have...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>slick combination of a soap opera and suspense film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a bit over-the-top as far as the plot goes, but not in a stupid or predictable way. Instead, it is pure dynamite--with so many bizarre twists and turns that you find yourself totally captivated. Subtle? No, but fun nevertheless. In this sense, it reminds me of the movie Peyton Place--a movie that is not high art but entertaining with juicy romance to boot! Gene Tierney is an apparently normal lady who falls for Cornel Wilde. They marry and so far everything looks just dandy. However, over time the evil and mentally unstable side of Tierney's personality begins to SLOWLY creep out--so slowly that she appeared to be the perfect wife to those around her. First, she is very jealous of all the time Wilde spends with his handicapped brother who lives with them (Darryl Hickman). So, one day instead of Wilde rowing along side as Hickman swims across the lake, she volunteers. Hickman is a decent swimmer but cannot make the entire journey, so the boat is there for when he tires. But, when he tires, Tierney rows away--letting him drown and ensuring that Cornel will be 100% hers!!! But, although she gets away with it, she does not have all 100% after all, as her lovely sister (Jeanne Crain) starts spending more and more time with them. Tierney's jealousy once again rears its ugly head but no matter how hard she tries, she can't drive Crain away. She KNOWS Wilde has fallen in love with Crain (though this is only her delusion--he is still devoted to his little psycho). So, she devises a plot to kill herself and frame THEM for murder!!! Because everyone THINKS Tierney is well, her plan nearly works--thanks to the incredibly zealous prosecution of attorney Vincent Price (who knew and loved Tierney for years).Whew!!! What a twisted and complicated plot, huh? Well, there's actually a lot more to it (such as Tierney throwing herself down the stairs to prevent an unwanted pregnancy)--watch and be amazed at how this movie will hold your attention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping and diabolical - Leave Her To Heaven is impossible to put down!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By its very definition, "film noir" (meaning, dark film) does not encompass Technicolor productions. A shame, since Darryl F. Zanuck's "Leave Her To Heaven" (1945) is as thrilling, disturbing and evocative of the noir style as anything shot in black and white. At best then, let's just say that "Leave Her to Heaven" is a rich, finely wrought tapestry of sinister thoughts and destructive ambition. The film, based on a novel by Ben Ames Williams, is concerned with the seemingly congenial romance that blossoms between famous writer, Richard Harland (Cornel Wilde, looking quite stylish and very handsome) and statuesque beauty, Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney, as smoldering, sultry and radiant as ever). Richard and Ellen meet as strangers on a train - a chance pairing that leads to an idyllic first summer retreat in the mountains with Ellen's family; mother, (Mary Philips), father (Ray Collins) and younger sister (fresh faced Jeanne Crain - clearly being groomed on this occasion as the odds on favorite for Richard's affections). A slight upset in Ellen's plans happens when her former boyfriend, Russell Quinton (Vincent Price) deliberately turns out to pitch a little rice on the side of her pending nuptials. Later, Quinton's own desires for Ellen will culminate in his prosecution of Richard for murder. But for now, Ellen isn't about to let anything or anyone come between her and the man of her passions. By the time Tierney made "Leave Her To Heaven" she had developed a reputation as Fox's good girl. The culmination of this role and her formidable zest to make the transformation from congenial maiden to cold-hearted vixen believable, forever altered that perception of her in Hollywood.As her younger sister, Jeanne Crain is an excellent foil and runner up for Richard's affections. Even Vincent Price is exceptionally convincing as Ellen's former and very jealous lover. The one disappointment, in terms of acting, is Cornel Wilde. Undeniably eye candy, Wilde's performance comes off rather stiff and unconvincing once the character of Richard awakens from his love struck stupor and realizes what sort of monster he's actually married. Nevertheless, the material given to all is indestructible, and directed with slick and sinister panache by the gifted John M. Stahl, "Leave Her To Heaven" emerges as sensational sure fire entertainment.Fox Home Entertainment has done a simply outstanding job in remastering this film for DVD. From its opening title sequence, so clear and finely rendered that one can make out the texture of paper on which the actor's names have been printed, to the deep focus photography which is luminous, there is absolutely no finer example of a Technicolor film to video transfer of this vintage available on the home video market today. Colors are rich and fully saturated. Shadow and contrast levels are superbly rendered. Clarity and fine detail throughout is outstanding. Blacks are solid and deep. Whites are pristine. The exterior photography is absolutely eye-popping. The audio has been remixed to stereo. But there is very little to distinguish it from the original Mono mix that has also been included. Extras include a stills gallery, audio commentary track, restoration comparison and theatrical trailer. Highly recommended for anyone who loves classic films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Melodrama or noir?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I actually studied this movie for a cinema class. After repeated watchings, I got quite bored of it but is nonetheless a good example of genres merging. With 'Leave Her to Heaven' we have the melodramatic plot, but characterisation and some plot elements that belong more to film noir than melodrama. Gene Tierney plays Ellen, a typical femme fatale from noir who is determined to be a good wife and just wants to be alone with her husband. Some of the plot developments do verge on the tragicomic, but its clear that things like lighting and overall mise en scene have been thought about by the director which isn't always the case with movies like this.Tierney was Oscar-nominated for this role and it certainly is one of her better performances. Her character is a lot more fleshed out and emotional than her eponymous role in 'Laura'.I wouldn't recommend this to the casual viewer, unless you're particularly interested in the actors or the genres. Thumbs firmly in the middle.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Shot 40's Corn</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Leave Her to Heaven" came out during a period when Hollywood was totally jazzed about psychological illness, its effects and its treatment. Two of the Academy Award best picture nominees from 1945 (the year of "Heaven's" release) were "The Lost Weekend" and "Spellbound," both dealing with some sort of mental psychosis. Of course, those movies focused on the ability of their respective protagonists to get better; "Leave Her to Heaven" includes the looniness, but leaves out the treatment part.Gene Tierney as Ellen comes about as close to serious acting as she ever would during her career, which isn't very close but is passable enough. She has a couple of effective scenes, namely the one in which she coldly watches her brother-in-law drown, but mostly the impact of her character is minimized by her obligation to always be beautiful. The plot is one of those corny, melodramatic 40's concoctions, in which the film goes around the world and back again to provide a happy ending that seems completely out of place. There are some hintings of psycho-babble about Ellen's too close attachment to her father and her tendency to destroy what she loves, but the film knows its limitations enough not to stray too far away from good old-fashioned sordid melodrama. Its' an enjoyable enough movie if you don't take it too seriously, with absolutely gorgeous cinematography that won the film its lone Oscar. The other actors are negligible: Cornel Wilde looks plastic-y and Jeanne Crain does her pert, wholesome American gal thing. No one else really registers. The score is over-used and makes several scenes unintentionally silly.But, I repeat, an entertaining film if you approach it with the right expectations---in other words, don't expect a masterpiece and you'll do just fine.Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film noir in color.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently read an attack on L.A. Confidential which said it was not a true film noir for two reasons: It was in color, and the heroes and villains were clearly defined, without a film noir's moral ambiguities. Leaving aside the moral obtuseness of anyone who cannot perceive the moral and psychological ambiguities of the heroes of L.A. Confidential, the first comment simply beggars belief. Yes, most of the great film noirs were in lustrous black and white., however, what makes a film noir a film noir is not its External color scheme, but the coloring it gives human psychology. Here, the thing that makes the film noir is the glistening blackness of its beautiful, obsessed, crazed heroine..and the horror of Leave Her to Heaven is that she IS a heroine. Gene Tierney makes this sadistic lunatic almost sympathetic, with her oedipal fetishes and her obsessive, destructive love. Yes, it is an incredibly campy, lunatic melodrama; it is also a powerful work of psychological terror.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gene Tierney: The most beautiful women in film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Film draws from two styles that were popular in the 40's Film Noir and the Melodrama. The story has the feel of the over the top melodrama filmed in color but has all the dark undercurrent of film noir. Director John Stahl was the master of the womens picture, he holds his vision and keeps the film balanced. Gene Tierney who was miscast in some of her earlier movies as Fox's good girl, Gene under Stahl's direction is spellbinding, she commands your attention. Gene Tierney was one of the most underrated Actresses of her day. The rest of the cast does a great job but this is Tierney's picture. Tierney received a Oscar nod for Best Actress (1945)I watched the DVD commentary with Darryl Hickman in which he has some issues with Stahl and Tierney ( He should get some help) He proceeds to compare the acting style of the 40's to the method style which really had not come into its own (in film) until the 50's with Brando etc......... I like the commentaries to get some insight, all I got where the rantings of a bitter man (child actor) who had a score to settle with Stahl and Tierney. I highly recommend the movie for people who want to see what Hollywood does best Entertain us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ellen's character is deep, troubled and deserves pity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film captures the essence of a woman, whose soul is being strangled by her need to be loved,at the high-intensity that she loves others specifically her father and her husband). Ellen's character is poorly labeled as an "Electra" complex- a Freudian concept stating that women have an unconscious desire to kill their mothers and be with their fathers. This isn't the first film to capture a physiological concept that has since been dismissed as bunk. The Snake Pit also toyed with this idea. I do not think that Ellen's disorder has anything to do with incestful love for her father. I think she is extremely insecure but still has an inflated ego.I also think the character suffered from obsessive compulsive disorder. I found myself sympathizing with her, even during the last scenes. It's difficult to explain to anyone who has never experienced these emotions, one person takes over your life so entirely that you cannot breath without thinking of them. It tortures your mind and you are as unhappy as they are, and you cannot stop. In modern times we have therapy for this, but in the 1940's, this problem wasn't understood. It's simply a form of obsessive-compulsive disorder. I felt distaste for Ruth and Richard throughout the entire film-especially during the ending. Richard could have soothed Ellen's disorder by allowing them to have a long honeymoon where they were alone. He could have reminded her every day how much he loved her, that she was the most important person in his life. A few months of this, and she would have been mentally strong enough to handle some time with Danny-although certainly not as much as the teen desired. The visiting family, the life with her sister and mother, the child and Danny were all mistakes made by Richard and lead her to her act of suicide. Richard was unknowingly selfish and obviously didn't understand his wife. This, and the lack of understanding of physiological problems pushed Ellen over the edge. By the end of the film, I actually felt deep pity for Ellen and sympathized greatly with her.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Only The Deity Can Judge Her Crime And Character</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gene Tierney got what arguably might be her best role in Leave Her To Heaven although personally I think that her screen career reached its height in Laura. An argument could also be made for The Razor's Edge which I also like. But when the Academy gives you an Oscar nomination for your work that does put some weight for this film being her best.Leave Her To Heaven with a preliminary scene with Cornel Wilde and Ray Collins starts out with Collins reminiscing about author Wilde meeting socialite Tierney on a cross country train. This film starts playing like any other Hollywood romantic film, but gradually Tierney does a fabulous job in revealing bit by bit an overwhelming and smothering obsession with her husband. She wants Wilde only and totally for herself, gradually getting rid of people around her. When all else fails she resorts to murder. It all comes crashing around her in the end.Some of the best acting is done without dialog. One of her murder victims is young Darryl Hickman a polio patient and Wilde's younger brother. Swimming was a preferred form of exercise for those with the disease, pioneered by no less than the current president of the United States. In fact at one point Hickman is in treatment at Warm Springs, Georgia. Tierney encourages Hickman to try a distance beyond his means and as he pitifully cries for help, she sits expressionless in a rowboat just feet from him in the middle of a lake. She later throws herself down a flight of stairs to kill her unborn child because she becomes convinced Cornel will spend more time with the baby than her.Playing a former suitor who was thrown over for Wilde is Vincent Price who as it turns out is the District Attorney and who later figures prominently in the plot. Price does a good job as always, but in watching him I couldn't help feeling, dummy don't you realize what a bullet you just dodged.Another obsession of Tierney's is her younger sister Jeanne Crain and did you ever see two more beautiful brunette sisters than these two on the screen? Her plan for Crain truly shows how sick Tierney has become.Gene Tierney lost the Oscar competition in 1945 to Joan Crawford for Mildred Pierce. Still she got critical acclaim for this part and there was no one saying that she was getting by on looks alone in Leave Her To Heaven. The film holds up very well today. I'm surprised it's not been remade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>she belongs in Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Slow starting and rather wooden throughout, but eventually becomes a riveting melodrama. The gorgeous principals and settings, in vivid Technicolor, largely make you forget about the slow pace and other deficiencies of the film. Although there are 3 shocking deaths, this is no 'who done it'. Ellen's(Gene Tierney) all too clear psychotic attachment to her deceased father neatly explains the train of events that she engineers, to no avail, to make her relationship with Richard(Cornel Wilde) a carbon copy of her relationship with her father. One suspects the latter probably extended into the sexual or semi-sexual realm, to explain the intensity of her attachment.First, she imagines that Richard, initially a mere train ride acquaintance, would make a near perfect replacement for her father. He's handsome, cultured, and, most importantly, appears vulnerable to her manipulation. But, she discovers that his devotion to Danny, his crippled much younger brother, is at least as strong as his devotion to her. She must find a way to get rid of Danny. When she unexpectedly becomes pregnant, she is afraid her pregnant figure will turn off Richard and that the birth of a child will dilute their close relationship. She must find a way to end her pregnancy and the life of her unborn child. But, her suspicious proximity to these 2 deaths distances Richard's attachment to her, rather than restoring his initial infatuation. At the same time, she senses that Richard and her live-in cousin Ruth(Jeanne Crain), have been gradually falling in love. She confronts Ruth and confesses that she never felt Richard liked her as a person, the way he likes Ruth. This is easy to believe, because Ellen is a rather aloof person, always dressed and acting like a model, all about overwhelming her man with her beauty and sexuality. In contrast, Ruth is interested in the welfare of others, animals and gardening, not in throwing herself at some man. We might expect Ellen to find a way to get rid of Ruth. But, she now realized that to stealthily eliminate Ruth would only drive Richard farther away from her, emotionally. Besides, Richard was now a changed brooding person, realizing the monster inside the barbie doll he had married. Instead, she set up a situation that potentially might extract sweet revenge on Ruth and Richard after her suicide...The infamous, way over the top, trial near the end of the film,served to determine if Ellen's posthumous revenge setup would work out as she had hoped.It's interesting that, according to Darryl Hickman, who played Danny, Gene Tierney in person was rather aloof, uncomfortable interacting with other actors on an informal basis. Perhaps her great beauty and privileged upbringing got in the way. She was not very friendly with either Cornel or Darryl. Later in life, she would exhibit mental instability and a suicide attempt or two. In contrast, like her character, he found Jeanne Crain friendly, if rather shy. Also, he found Cornel very friendly and helpful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Twisted and morbid in its own right; but Leave Her to Heaven is, frustratingly, only periodically involving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Stahl's 1945 film Leave Her to Heaven begins with that familiar 20th Century Fox ident, complete with the searchlights, with its original fanfare re-dubbed and replaced with its own mysterious and unnerving tune. It comes off as a near death march-like series of drum and symbol noises; perhaps suggesting content so shocking that alerting the audience to something not entirely 'right' with proceedings needs to be highlighted so early on that the overriding of the studio's typical theme for its own icon must be carried out. The film will start in the present day before harking back to the past; Leave Her to Heaven mostly one long flashback told orally in that it is narrated to us by an elderly man speaking to another and we feel the film is headed for doomed territory.The catalyst for the story being told is in young author Richard Harland (Wilde), whom has just been released from prison, arriving at a pretty lake house and the presence of the two men. He wears a look of dishevelment and grief; a seemingly beaten man but maybe an angry one although most definitely despondent in his overall demeanour. Prior to darting back to days of old, the elderly narrator informs us that "jail is Hell for a man like that" thus inferring a sense of upstandingness Richard might have initially had about him, whereas the mentioning of jealousy suggests that this was a key item in whatever it was that went wrong. We start again on board a cross country train some time ago; young woman Ellen (Tierney) sits reading one of Richard's books opposite him and they get talking, the interplay between them both before and after the revealing that it is Richard's book she's reading well executed. The impact she has on him sees him temporarily forget where it is he's headed; the train stopping at a small New Mexico town which happens to be both person's stop. So far, so film noir; the idea that a man is lost amidst a particular woman's presence despite quite clearly being of an educated ilk, as well as that unnerving sense of something rife with destruction and death in the overriding of the studio's traditional theme, plus the film's own manipulation of time in its flashing back all mixing together to create unease.However, what comes to unfold is a tale of obsession and distrust under a different sort of guise; in that it is Ellen whom looses her mind over Richard, a relationship which is granted ample enough attention during their exchanges and dialogue over sessions beside a pool and large family gatherings during the evenings at this whitewashed haven. As time drifts by, Ellen's infatuation with Richard grows stronger; so much so that her fiancé in lawyer Russell Quinton (Price) becomes her ex. following Ellen's engagement to Richard. Their paring allows Ellen access to the before-seen secluded and somewhat luxurious lake-house Richard runs, but it additionally sees Ellen have to bond with her new husband's acquaintances; predominantly his young but crippled brother Danny (Hickman).The film is more an outlining of a form of obsessive jealousy than anything else, Tierney's Ellen coming to resemble a quite despicable incarnation of extreme mental illness when it transpires she cannot have Richard all to herself. It is only on very rare occasions a femme fatale will love those whom she snares; Leave Her to Heaven's sole revolving around of a character with nothing else on her agenda but loving a man somewhat defeating the typical convention, and not particularly doing so in a manner which makes it any more interesting or engaging. The narrative is a consistent pattern of sheer wrong-doing and there is little in the way of ambiguity in what it is Ellen does; her actions are quite clearly sinful and wrong, whereas those she victimises do nothing but stick to the straight and narrow. Where the core of a film noir will central in on a character whose morals are questionable and whose actions are persistently ambiguous in relation to an overall state of morality, most of the people we come across in Leave Her to Heaven are already on a definitive 'side' of that boundary and remain there throughout. Both sets of characters are so far apart on the proverbial overall spectrum that the moral tight rope most noir leads tiptoe back and forth on is miles out of sight - the film ultimately coming to have more in common with the genre of melodrama than any sort of noirish form.The film is propped up by some wonderful performances, Hickman's portrayal of the poor little boy whom would nary say or do a bad thing rightfully overplayed so as to enhance certain reactions we have to certain events; whereas Tierney ploughs on through her role with brutal efficiency in light of the material she is effectively given. The film is daring in its shooting of most of Richard's later interactions with Ellen's sister through the eyes of Ellen: a forcing of the audience to observe the world through her twisted, hate-filled and envious eyes; her eyes of which are later tactfully covered up by some sunglasses during a particularly disturbing sequence. The effective cloaking of her eyes with said prop thus rendering her overall facial expression dead, machine-like or even non-human; in doing so neatly capturing her inhumane characteristics as she does what she does. The film is not without merit, its narrative is a little limp in its gradual plodding from one symptom of mental illness rendered a disgracefully amoral set-piece to the next, while the courtroom sequence at the very end needs cutting completely. I don't know if I entirely agree with the labelling of the film as one of the film noir variety; but where I can find middle-ground is in agreeing that it is a neat and effective little dramatisation of mental illness which holds up.</fullReview>

Everyone seems to have been told to stand around and be as still as possible, talk in a monotone and, whatever you do, do not under any circumstances express any emotions. The story: daft as daft can be. Ellen 'loves' too much? Give me a break. And the way Ruth gets off in the end? Richard says his wife committed a crime and the jury believes him without a shred of evidence on his part and in the face of the impressive case the prosecution has built up? Unbelievable.

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning Technicolor and an extremely good performance by Gene Tierney in a preposterous role</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this movie a ten for several reasons. Is it a great movie? Well, actually no. But here is an example where the parts are greater than the whole. It's time for a re-evaluation of Gene Tierney. Yes, she was one of the most beautiful women in film history. No, she wasn't one of the greatest actresses--however, she was a much better one than she is given credit for, especially when she had a good director, as she does here with John Stahl. "Leave Her to Heaven" is her only Oscar-nominated performance; and she is very, very good. The scene of her wearing dark glasses and rowing a boat is indelibly memorable if you've seen the movie. Ellen, Tierney's character, IS preposterous--but Tierney makes the whole thing work. Ellen reminds me of Mrs. Robinson in "The Graduate"; I know I'm in the minority, but Mrs. R. is the only likable character in "The Graduate." The rest of the characters are annoying--especially Benjamin; Bancroft makes Robinson the one bright bulb in the chandelier: extremely witty, bored by life and those around her, always in control (until the end). Likewise, Ellen in "Leave Her to Heaven." Although I like Jeanne Crain, she does get a bit cloying here--or at least her character Ruth does. Cornel Wilde is far too vapid to imagine Ellen going to such extremes to get him and keep him. The color photography--which won an Oscar--is luridly beautiful as only Technicolor could be at its best. The entire movie is beautifully and lovingly filmed, especially Tierney, who is also stunning in black and white, especially in "Laura" and, in her best performance, "The Razor's Edge," another movie that works far better than it should and holds up remarkably well today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS*** You can see right away that things haven't been going that good for Richard "Dick" Harland, Cornel Wilde, as he just was released from the can-prison-for a crime he was totally innocent of. Back home in Deer Lake Maine Dick now reflects on the strange events and unforeseen circumstances that in the end destroyed not only his life but his crippled-from polio-kid brother Danny's, Darryl Hickman, as well as the life of the woman he loved Ellen Berent Harland, Gene Tierney.Having met Dick innocently enough on a train ride to Jacinto New Mexico Ellen turned her guns on the unsuspecting young writer in what she really wanted from him. A daddy or father figure which Dick, who has a striking resemblance to her deceased old man Pappa Berent, fit right into! Staying at the Berent house in the middle of the dry and desolated New Mexican Desert Dick felt, the peace and quite there, it would help him in writing his latest novel "The Deep Well". What in fact happened to Dick was something you wouldn't even wish on your worst enemy! He got caught in the clutches, by being suckered into marrying her, the extremely jealous and vindictive Ellen Berent! And with that his life was soon turned into a living hell by her!It took him a while but Dick was soon to find out that his wife Ellen was in fact engaged to East Coast politician Russell Quinton, Vincent Price, whom she dumped for him without even bothering to tell telling Quinton about it. This later, after Dick and Ellen were married, caused a very wild confrontation between Quinton Dick and Elen when he showed up unexpectedly at the Berent residence wanting an explanation from her for leaving him!It's later when Ellen is introduced to Dick's kid brother the polio stricken Danny that she starts, in seeing how close the brothers are to each other, plans to get him out of the way permanently. Danny ends up getting deep sixths when he's left on his own, with Ellen in a rowboat sanding by, when he tried to swim across Deer Lake that's by Dick's country home "Back to the Moon". The unearthly sounding "Back to the Moon" is in fact is in the state of Maine not on the lunar surface as its name suggests.By the time that Ellen purposely forced a miscarriage on her, by falling down a flight of stairs, when she was about to give birth to her and Dick's child is when Dick finally realized that there was something very wrong upstairs-in the head-with her. It's then that Dick desperately tried to get Ellen professional help before she ended up killing someone else whom she felt was a threat to her relationship with him. ***SPOILERS*** This time around Ellen really went off the deep end in doing in someone-her step sister Ruth played by Jeanne Crain-whom she felt was getting a bit too romantic with her husband! But the way she did it was completely out of character for her in implicating, by his omission in not turning her in to the police, non other then Dick in the sinister crime she had planned against Ruth! With herself being the victim of it!What a sap and hopeless sucker this Dick Harland turned out to be in having his wife Ellen make him the fall guy for all the crimes that she committed. Now, as at the beginning of the movie, finally free from Ellen Dick can now go back to his shattered life and try to reconstruct and make a go out of it. That's if he still had both the willpower as well as faith in the human race to do it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a stunning psychological thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The last time I had seen this film was when I was a kid - and I have never forgotten it - the vivid Technicolour, the evilness of Ellen,the outstanding beauty of the two stars and, of course the "swimming" scene. Gene Tierney would have to be on any list of the top ten beauties of the 20th Century but, golly, Jeanne Crain was no slouch either. I had the opportunity to see the film again recently and I was not disappointed. Jeanne Crain appeared on the Hollywood scene in 1943 - just in time to be 20th Century Fox's new "girl next door". She was extremely popular during the 40s in heartwarming films like "Margie" and a musical remake of "State Fair" in which she was being groomed as a "Janet Gaynor" type. After "State Fair" which grossed over $4 million, Jeanne was named a "Star of Tomorrow". Had she been less a family woman and put her career before marriage she may have had longer lasting stardom. In "Leave Her to Heaven" she was merely set decoration - but what set decoration!!!!Richard (Cornel Wilde) meets Ellen Berent (Gene Tierney) on a train and he is instantly under the spell of her beauty. She along with her mother and sister, the more demure Ruth (Jeanne Crain - they actually could pass as sisters) have come to this exotic locale in New Mexico to scatter the ashes of her father on the mountains he loved so much. The book could have explained a lot - why did the father die? There were occasional conversations about Ellen loving the father too much and her love driving him to his grave. Apparently in the book she even starts a forest fire!!! Ellen is determined that Richard will never leave her and callously breaks off her engagement to Quinton (Vincent Price). The scene, where he calls in to find out why she sent back his ring is the first time Ellen is visibly agitated - when she closes the door to converse with him, her face drops the mask and she looks quite petulant. Ellen and Richard are married in a whirlwind - but she still has to contend with Richard's younger brother Danny (Darryl Hickman, giving an over eager performance that was quite irritating at times). Riichard has been used to having Danny around but Ellen's obsession and jealousy can't put up with that. The swimming scene, to me, was memorable because of Ellen's icy beauty - sitting motionless in the boat, her sunglasses hiding her eyes and her blood red lipstick. Another memorable scene was the "arranged surprise" that Richard and Danny cook up - bringing Ellen's mother and sister out to "Back of the Moon" for a visit. The look of pure hatred on Ellen's face when she sees them all on the boat - turns into an evening from hell as she does her best to make everyone feel ill at ease.After this the film gathers speed toward it's conclusion. After what I thought was a lovely leisureliness to the film - the court scene was frenetic with "Do you love Richard?", "Do you love Ruth?", "Yes, I love him, I love him" being thrown about. Funnily enough Richard and Ruth are meant for each other - they were both colourless, bland and nice!!!Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leave Her To Heaven - Outstanding !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are movies, and then there are the current trash, churned out mass produced garbage of today. Leave Her To Heaven was well acted by all the actors From Cornell Wilde to Chill Wills. In fact too bad that good old Chill, who normally acted minor parts in about 50 pictures, couldn't occupy more of the movie. This rugged and likable Texan was one of Hollywood's first volunteers into the Marines during World War II. The adorable Gene Tierney was outstanding and glamorous, even though cast as a femme fatal. Acting her usual glamorous self, she was still able to portray a woman jealously in love with her husband, to the detriment to all around her. She was involved in 2 deaths (her brother in law and unborn baby boy), plus her own suicide. You could still love her - but only for the reason that she so loved her husband in such a violently jealous way, to the point of derangement. There was sadness overall to the movie, but beauty and a somewhat happy ending with Jeanie Crain, her adopted sister - another outstanding and glamorous actress.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sooooo good to see Tierney sooooo bad....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it's not complete genius, I think this movie is just awfully entertaining! Tierney's character should rank up there with all the great evil ladies of the screen. The film is beautiful to look at, the story moves along....the shock of what Tierney will do for the demented love she feels for Cornel Wilde! I don't want to give too much away for those who have yet to see it, just rent it and enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Technicolor melodrama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ellen (drop dead gorgeous Gene Tierney) falls in love with Richard (Cornel Wilde) for some really creepy reason I won't give away. They marry and she wants him all to herself...and will get rid of anyone that gets in her way!Trashy, silly and lots of fun. If you can see this film (and I heartily recommend it) make sure it's a good color print. If it's faded, don't bother. This film was shot in rich, beautiful color--it's the film's main asset. Every single shot looks beautiful. All the scenery is breathtaking, all the costumes are beautiful, everybody looks perfect--especially Tierney. She's just stunning and gives an incredible performance. In fact, she was nominated for an Oscar for this one. She should have gotten it--instead Joan Crawford won for "Mildred Pierce".The story is slow at times (and there are logic gaps) but then you just let the beautiful images wash over you. All the acting is good--except for Wilde. He's handsome but rather stiff and dull as Tierney's husband. You wonder what she saw in him.So it's great fun trash. Well worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pretty good drama featuring some of the top names from the good old days of talkies. A young Vince Price looked different from his later films where he mostly played loonies in old houses. Or so it seems. No problem identifying Chill Wills goofy mug. I really liked the locales, especially the beautiful old southwest home and the cabin at the back of the moon. Arizona and Wyoming provided some great backdrop for the otherwise ugly goings-on. Why two men fell for this doxy is pretty apparent: she was a beauty. However, I couldn't believe how easily she led her fiancee around by his nose ring. There's only so much a pretty face can do before the pussy whipping gets old. After all, as Jane Fonda neatly put it in "Stanley and Iris": "beauty fades".</fullReview>
