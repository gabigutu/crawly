		<shortDescription>"I Don't Mind"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"I don't mind" is a leitmotiv of Czech vintage movie The Life is Dog. It's a classical comedy by Mac Fric, based on screenplay by him and Hugo Haas who plays the double-character in this movie. It's a story of unsuccessful musical composer who falls in love with beautiful daughter of musical publisher. It's beginning of thirties, the time of crisis and large unemployment so he starts to pretend that he is his own uncle and got a good job in this company. This is a source of many comical situations which are often presented in a short anecdotal episodes. The performances are great. Hugo Haas is funny, Adina Mandlová is attractive and winsome (and quite naive), Theodor Pistek is both rigorous and kind... The music is wonderful too, the composer of it was Pavel Haas, brother of Hugo, interesting composer whose the best known works were written in the detention camp Theresienstadt.</fullReview>
