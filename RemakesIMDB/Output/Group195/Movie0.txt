		<shortDescription>Try to ignore the ludicrous title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the dreadful title, this is a well made, thought provoking Sci-fi film. A young bride discovers that her husband is not the man she fell in love with, but a hideous alien in a specially constructed shell. The thought provoking part, is the ambiguous character of the aliens. At first you are convinced that these ugly creatures are on earth for evil intent. as the film progresses, you are aware of their desperation to survive, even if they have to kill to do it. In one excellent scene, a hooded alien stares longingly at a doll in a shop window, and then ruthlessly kills one of the locals without a second thought. this stimulates both compassion and revulsion. Both Gloria Talbott and Tom Tryon as the leading actors, give good understated performances, and in the final scene, Tryons' alien becomes a terribly pathetic creature whose only desire was to see the continuation of his race. Are the aliens good or evil? the jury is still out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Better Than Average 50's Sci-Fi Flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This has to definitely be one of the better science fiction films of the mid to late 1950's. The only thing that hurts this film is the lousy title. The thing that really impressed me about it is the fact that this film isn't a typical B-movie. In fact, this film gives you a very thought provoking story as well as what another person said, a kind of poignancy that you never would expect from this type of film. In fact, you pretty much feel that towards the end of the film that Marge is actually falling for the alien posing as her beloved Bill. Also, you pretty much feel sorry for the impostor at the end as he is beginning to experience the emotions that he never had, especially love. Unfortunately, the film is undone by its typically lousy 1950's B-movie title. However, once you look past the title and look at how good the story is, you will see that this film is a pretty decent film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Deeper Than You Think</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another thinly veiled reference to the Communist witch hunt, 'I Married A Monster From Outer Space' is a movie with a cheesy title and a decent story. Aliens have come to Earth to impersonate American men while using a ray-gun on the women (they really don't like hookers). The flip here is that while they ARE taking over the bodies &amp; lives of the men they capture, they're trying to live the way we do. Are they also trying to love? It's almost touching. Even though the classic paranoia sci-fi flick 'Invasion Of The Body Snatchers' is an obvious influence, the second half is where the two movies diverge. You can almost root for the body snatchers in 'I Married A Monster'.The B cast never humiliate themselves, but none of them are particularly memorable either. Gene Fowler Jr. (longtime editor, sometime director) leads his actors through the paces in competent fashion. Tom Tryon and Gloria Talbott don't cause too many sparks, but they're not really supposed to. Along with the actual subversion of humanity, this is also an allegory for how newlyweds can quickly grow apart and---okay, I'll say it---alienated. And although this movie is classified as horror/sci-fi, the American Film Institute saw fit to nominate it for their list of 400 great American love stories. Filled with subtext and double-meanings (as so many overlooked B movies are), the flick accomplishes more by saying less. The F/X are about as dated and obvious as such things get, but they weren't perfect in other '50s genre films either. You might laugh at 'I Married A Monster', but you could do much worse for 78 minutes. This can't be said for half the modern movies out there, but you SHOULD look closer at this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'I Married A Monster From Outer Space' should be ranked as one of the great 50s sci-fi/ horror films. I was really surprised at how well done this movie was. I guess I was expecting a Ed Wood type film, which wouldn't necessarily be a bad thing, but what I saw, was an above average, well acted and directed movie. This film was surprisingly well done. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It held my attention from start to finish. Creepy alien monsters keep popping up throughout the movie. It had a sense of suspense running throughout the film. This movie grabs your attention fast and just doesn't let go. It was great. 'I Married A Monster From Outer Space' is a must see for all 50s sci-fi, horror, monster movies fans.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With a title this corny, I was expecting a lot of laughs, a fun B-movie with Ed Wood-style film-making. Well, I got them, but that mostly in the beginning. The bulk of the film is quite serious and holds up pretty well, even today.The best lines, in the opening segments, come from "Marge" (Gloria Talbott), the one I quoted for the subject head. She said that on her wedding night at the restaurant, since her new husband seemed to be ignoring her. You see, her hubby had already been taken over by an extra-terrestrial being the night before. He just wasn't himself after that.....but who knew? Unfortunately, nobody for quite awhile in this story, which made life rough for poor "Marge Ferrell." The lines in this film weren't just corny. Some of them were downright funny. At the guy's bachelor party, which began the show, the men had some humorous lines about marriage and freedom, and later in the show there are a couple of funny scenes. Later one of Marge friends acts goofy and remarks, "I just love to rehearse for weddings, especially when they are my own!" However, the story begins to get serious after the first 10-15 minutes and gets more and more so after Marge follows her husband one night and sees her odd-acting husband is not the man she thought she married. Laser beams and a spaceship will do that to you! From that point, it becomes a very familiar story for fans of sci-fi: something we've seen in a lot of films the past 50 years - aliens transform into humans and one that hasn't gets burned by family and friends she trusts because she doesn't realize they, too, have also turned into aliens.In other words, this has a lot of "Invasion Of The Body Snatchers" type of paranoia story, just without the pods. "Invasion" was released two years earlier than this in 1956. Hollywood, lacking imaginative writers the past few decades, continues to make films with the same storyline as you see here., but this one can be excused because it was still fairly early in the genre.Thanks to the actors here, and a few different twists, the movie keeps your attention. The only frustration is to see a person telling the truth and not being believed. Talbott, to me, was a familiar face because she acted in many television shows in the 1960s while Tyron, who got some hype for starring in "The Cardinal," a big-name film that bombed at the box office, wound up being a better writer than an actor. But when it comes to '50s sci-fi films, great acting isn't a requirement anyway, and most of us don't watch it for that.Overall, this is pretty good, nothing super but certainly worth a look now that there is a good DVD transfer of it available. Yes, it is far better than the stupid title but still: don't take it too seriously - just have fun with it.Note: the police captain was played by John Eldredge, a regular guest on "The Adventures Of Superman," in which he almost always played a villain. Also ex-boxer Maxie Rosenbloom is his normal entertaining self in here, playing, as usual, a bartender.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie with imagination and humor.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Often over-looked gem from the 1950s, in which Gloria Talbott plays a young bride who discovers that her husband is actually an alien impostor, a member of an advance force of alien invaders who are secretly replacing the male populations in Gloria's town. The female population on the alien's home planet has been wiped out by solar radiation prior to a nova, so their race is dying out. Now the aliens hope to `alter' the bodies of the Earth women so they can produce alien children. The script by Louis Vittes does a good job of dealing with the most unsettling aspect of the plot; alien husbands doing things with their human wives that only HUMAN husbands are supposed to do.Vittes also manages to weave some very sly humor into the story. When Gloria goes to the local doctor for help in battling the aliens, he quickly realizes that the only men in town who are verifiably human are the ones whose wives are pregnant. So we see him hurrying into the waiting room of the hospital's maternity ward to round up a pose' to battle the aliens! Funny.The aliens are scary and well designed, and the ray gun effects by ace effects artist John P. Fulton are above average. Don't be fooled by the unfortunate title; this is a fine entry to the list of 1950s sci-fi films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic, just don't get swayed by the "B" feature title.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rate this right up there with other 50s sci-fi classics, Invasion of the Body Snatchers, Day the Earth Stood Still, and Them. The title makes you think you're in for a radioactive-teens-with-fangs-from-outerspace bomb. This is anything but. Excellent acting, tight direction, believable dialog, and truly creepy aliens give this a black and white thumbs up. Remade recently in a faithful adaptation, but despite (or because of) the color photography and bigger budget, this 50s version remains the better bet to watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good sci-fi movie of the 50's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was almost certainly inspired by the McCarthian communist "witch hunts" of the 1950's.The choice of title for this movie certainly does not do the film justice,which is probably why the film isn't thought of as being in the same league as"Invaders from Mars" and "Invasion of the Body Snatchers",another two films which develop the theme of this hidden "enemy within".Althougth, in my opinion, not as good as those films,it is still,nevertheless,worth adding to the collection of any sci-fi film fan. I do feel that this was one of Gloria Talbot's better film roles.The plot unfolds fairly evenly,with Tom Tyron body being taken over by an alien in the first few scenes.What gradually follows is the actual extent of the alien takeover and their intentions.This movie is available on DVD.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie talks upon an aircraft from outer space that arrives to earth and go out aliens and they are hanging with human beings . As Aliens from Outer Space are slowly switching places with real humans . One of the first switching is an attractive young (Tom Tryon) about to get wedded to a beautiful girl called Marge (Gloria Talbott). One year marriage later she still feels there are numerous rare things about him , as he doesn't have feelings , nor emotions. A horrified Marge then attempts to warn everyone of the alien threat . It's a typical B movie of the 50s , it has suspense , thriller , tension and fun . Tom Tryon as the alien husband is fine and Gloria Talbott as his distrustful wife is enjoyable , she usually was in sci-fi films by that time . There appears a very secondary role , Ty Hardin , who along with Tom Tryon were two beefcakes who habitually played movies for youth . In fact , the scene at the beach gave movie audiences their first look at Ty Hardin's bare chest . Special effects , FX , are average , though by that time were quite well ; they are in charge of John P.Fulton , a craftsman with great experience and a long career from the silent cinema . Production design by Henry Bumstead who has worked along with Alfred Hitchcock (Vertigo, Topaz) and today continues , being Clint Eastwood's usual set decorator (Unforgiven , Mystic river) . However , the sets in aircraft interior are ridiculous and embarrassing . The motion picture was regularly directed by Gene Fowler Jr , he was a famous editor and occasionally director of Western as ¨The Oregon Trail¨ and terror as ¨I was a teenage wolf¨ . The flick will appeal to science fiction and fantastic movies fans . Rating : Mediocre but amusing .</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is truly a great movie with a great tense atmosphere throughout most of the entire film. The acting is incredibly good and believable by the main characters bill and marge farell ( TOM TRYON, GLORIA TALBOTT)as well as the rest of the cast. You even feel sorry for the aliens at the end of the movie. The only thing wrong with this film is the B-title as a previous commentator stated. It really hurts the movie. I know i passed on it quite a few times on cable untill i gave in. I'm glad i gave in. An 8 out of 10 in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Norrisville, Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon) leaves his bachelor party on the eve of his marriage with Marge Bradley (Gloria Talbott). He is abducted by an alien that takes his shape and marries Marge on the next day. Marge feels something strange with Bill and one year later she realizes that he is a totally different man. One day, Marge follows Bill and he goes to the woods; she finds that he is an alien and sees his spacecraft. She tries to tell to Washington and to the FBI, but the aliens have dominated key people in town that do not allow any sort of communication with the exterior world. What is the intention of the alien invasion?"I Married a Monster from Outer Space" is a great sci-fi movie from the 50's. The storyline is a rip-off of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", with aliens switching places with humans in a small town with the purpose of breeding. But the plot is well-constructed and supported by good performances. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "I Married a Monster from Outer Space"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can imagine teenagers at the drive-in back in 1958. The guys probably anticipated a romantic encounter when the monster jumped out of the bushes and Mary Ellen Rogers jumped into their arms.Sadly for our young romeos, everybody in the car was far too engrossed in the flick to do much of anything. As everyone else has commented the title is horrible, but the film is a true classic. It's better than "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" because it personalizes the aliens-among-us theme better. Instead of a swinging bachelor like Dr. Bennell, we get a young, white couple in the suburbs doing everything they're supposed to (including being celibate 'till marriage) and it all goes to hell. How's THAT for fifties conformity?Ever think you'd see a woman with "female" problems in a fifties sci-fi flick? What about the lecherous alkies in the out-of-town country club and at the local watering holes? I didn't think those types existed in the fifties. Everything about this film flies in the face of the Eisenhower-era, and it does so unapologetically and without remorse... another reason it bests "Snatcher", a great movie in its own right.Special effects are pretty good. The limited use of them enhances the effectiveness. As a kid, these aliens scared the hell out of me because of what I DIDN'T see. I recall watching it when I was about seven or eight on television, and for weeks I scanned the side of the road whenever the family traveled to the edge of town. I was on the alert to see the glowing creatures that were oh-so-close to the car just on the side of the road.Writing and direction are tight and Tom Tryon (later Gothic novelist) is good as the wooden alien, but Gloria Talbot is primo as the protagonist. This is really her film and the performance of this late actress was Oscar caliber. Yep, it's that good. Again, not too many U.S. films had a female heroine as the lead.I hear the new DVD release doesn't have any new information and both Tryon and Talbot are dead so don't look for any interviews. No matter... buy it without shame or embarrassment. This flick still packs a wallop today and I can't imagine what the 1950s sensibilities had to say about the message of the "red scare", alcoholism (there's booze everywhere in this movie), infertility and interplanetary sex. It's like an episode of Maury Povich, but done with class and style. Despite being on the underbill of "I Was A Teenage Werewolf", this is NOT A B-MOVIE!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Preposterous Title, Good Sci-Fi Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If I had seen the little-known actors Gloria Talbott and Tom Tryon in a movie titled "I Married a Monster from Outer Space" in 1958, I very likely would not have gone to see it because of the title. However, to ignore this movie is cheating oneself, since it's a dark, creepy, and altogether enjoyable sci-fi about an alien invasion.Bill Ferrell (Tryon) is out drinking before his wedding day, and is overcome by a mysterious dark cloud. Now controlled by aliens, he marries Marge (Talbott) and is determined to populate the earth with alien babies. There's something wrong with the aliens though, and they can't breed with earth women. Soon many of the town's men are also controlled by the aliens, and Marge can't call, telegraph, or even leave town with the dreadful news. Eventually the local doctor (Ken Lynch) has the bright idea to recruit "real human men" among new dads at the local maternity ward, and the aliens are defeated in a pitched battle outside of town.This film has an abundance of wonderful vignettes: a local B-girl tries to pick up one of the aliens; a gangster (James Anderson) is lurking around the Ferrell's house and is eliminated by alien-controlled policemen; an alien-controlled man dies when he is given oxygen by paramedics after an accident; a local bartender punches Bill Ferrell on the jaw repeatedly with no effect; and of course the human men overcome the aliens in the climactic battle in a forest.The special effects are truly good for 1958, and Tryon--who usually had the acting range of a statue--is very convincing. I think Talbott gave the performance of her career, as the woman who is trapped with aliens and has no way out. Highly recommended, despite the title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best 1950s sci fi movies; a true classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maligned by many for its title, but recognised by most as a movie whose depth, entertainment value and chilling moments certainly belie the triteness of the title. Personally, I think it's a great title; it's like the teenagers from the 'I was a teenage?' movies have grown up and are ready for marriage only to discover that there are even greater threats than werewolves and patchwork monsters to contend with. Basically, male shape ? shifting aliens whose females died out subsequent to a planetary catastrophe have infiltrated a small American town by assuming the appearances and to some extent the characters of local young men with a view to eventually altering female DNA to allow them to bare their offspring. The story focuses for the most part on the plight of newlywed Marge Farrell (Gloria Talbott) whose husband Bill (Tom Tryon) is abducted by aliens of the eve of their wedding and replaced by one of them who initially seems like a perfect copy but whose true nature is gradually revealed as Marge's fears and paranoia deepen in a clever commentary on how well we really know people. But there's a lot more to it than that; you really need to check it out to see how good it is. Gloria Talbott is great as Marge; her deepening crises as she proceeds through feelings of confusion, doubt, fear, acceptance and, ultimately, recognition of her role in the survival of the 'human' species (be it under threat from aliens or communists depending on your perspective) are all expertly conveyed and seem to improve with subsequent viewings. Tom Tyron is OK as Bill and does manage to express a kind of detachment that suits the 'not quite there' nature of the character. Gene Fowler's direction is fine, except for the day for night work which is unpardonably bad, and John Fulton's special effects are great for the time and include such highlights as laser beams and really disgusting melting effects for the eerily glowing aliens. And what about those aliens! For my money they are simply the best aliens of the 1950s? big, ugly, and glowing yet trying to get to grips with the complexities of being human! Stephen King when describing the aliens faces called them 'runnelled and knotted and warty', elsewhere they've simply been described as 'rhubarb like', although one critic dismissed them as 'risible' (perhaps he was watching the 'pompous ass' cut of the film; I'm sure that critics see a different version of these movies than the rest of us!) and they are all of these things and more, depending on how you look at them.Some of the themes are interesting even today. Modern day ufologists for example will be very familiar with alien abduction accounts and the notion of emotionless extraterrestrials attempting to cross breed with humans, a fairly unusual perspective in the 1950s which from the UFO viewpoint was dominated by the contactee movement. The viewer may also find themselves experiencing mixed feelings towards the aliens. You can easily understand why they want to keep their species going and can to some extent sympathise with their confusion over human emotions but it's hard to reconcile those feelings with the ruthlessness with which they attempt to achieve their goals. Having said that, I had no qualms about them killing the sleazy bar fly who was stalking Marge but did feel some pity when the hooker got zapped!Whatever way you decide to view this movie, it is, in my opinion, an absolute gem and fully deserving of 'classic' status. For some reason it doesn't appear to be available on DVD in the UK, so I am having to rely on my battered and worn old VHS copy taped years ago when the TV channels here still had the balls to show mad old movies but, if you do get the chance to check it out I'm sure you'll agree that this is 1950s American sci fi at its absolute best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Shot, They Turned to Pudding</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was such a great time to be a kid. We had a constant ration of these cold war movies. We were taught to duck and cover if we saw a nuclear flash. My sister and I went to see this as part of a double feature with "The Blob" about four times. Like "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," there were aliens who were up to no good. Since they were the incarnation of the communists, they had no soul. They were there to force their ideology on us all, turn us into zombie like automatons. The danger in this movie came from the authorities who had been absorbed by the space critters. You just couldn't trust the police. The good thing was that if you knew who they were, you could kill them pretty much like other humans. And, when they died, they turned into pudding or applesauce or something that flowed out of their sleeves and pants legs. The hard part was like in "Invasion." You had to get the word out and convince people that what you were saying weren't the rantings of a lunatic. Nevertheless, we can take solace that good will out and the good old American way will turn those suckers into pudding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A '50s Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite the fact that this film has a ridiculous title, it really is quite a little gem. During the 1950's the spread of Communism was the great fear in America and many films reflected this through the analogy of aliens infiltrating society. This movie is one of them....aliens taking over the population without being noticed....the guy next door may be a Communist (or a monster from outer space). Gloria Talbot,who appeared in a score of 50's movies (whatever happened to her?) does a good job as the suspicious wife but she wears one of the strangest pointed bras you've ever seen and even wears it in bed! Tom Tryon sleepwalks through the part of the husband, which in this film is appropriate for the role. He was a very bland actor and eventually went on to a sucessful career as a novelist. The black and white cinematography is well done and the film evokes a sense of impending doom. The special effects, which are limited, are not too bad...remember this was 1958. This film is a standout in a series of lower budget movies of the time but the awkward title may cause some to pass it by. Recommend it to a friend.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some of those sci-fi movies from the '50s linger in the memory because of the way they dramatize our most personal fears. "The Incredible Shrinking Man," for example, plays upon a man's fear of becoming weak and inadequate. "I Married a Monster from Outer Space" deals with a woman's fear of entering into a relationship which proves disappointing or even disturbing. (Some say the movie is a disguised account of a woman's marriage to a gay man.) I'm not sure I'd call the resulting movie a "classic," but its quiet, moody, and compassionate quality clearly puts it above most of the noisy, special-effects extravaganzas of today.Gloria Talbot is both persuasive and appealing as the puzzled but faithful wife. (None of the shallow, comic-book character of Lara Croft here!) And the almost-too-good-to-be-true looks of the sexually-ambiguous Tom Tryon are put to effective use as the husband. As usual, the film's makers find an excuse to get his shirt off so we can get another look at that much-photographed torso. In this same scene, you'll also spot a bare-chested Ty Hungerford, just before he changed his name to "Ty Hardin" and became "Bronco" on the TV series. (And no, there's nothing sexually ambiguous about Ty.) Curiously, both men are included in the book, "Lash! The Hundred Great Scenes of Men Being Whipped in the Movies." Hardin's flogging in a "Bronco" episode ranks 26th and Tryon's whipping in "The Cardinal" ranks 46th.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bad title, great '50's sci-fi film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Fifties were a notable decade for Sci-Fi films. The Cold War was on, and there was rampant paranoia about Communism; a generalized paranoia that was fueled in a large part by McCarthy and his "House Un-American Activities Committee". Personal example of the time: I was born in the same year as this film was made, and I grew up in a house that had been built to my parents' specifications to include a real bomb shelter in its basement. Movies such as the classics "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", and "I Married a Monster From Outer Space" played on this theme, translated into Sci-Fi films.The sensationalist title belies the quality of the film and its well-told storyline. Although I am also fond of "Invasion of the Body Snatchers", which has a similar theme, it lacks the heart of the subject of this review, in my opinion.Marge (Gloria Talbott) and Bill (Tom Tryon) are getting married, but Marge doesn't realize at first that the night before the wedding her groom's body was taken over by an alien being. She notices the differences in his personality but brushes them aside. She soon comes to realize the true nature of what she has married, and of course tries to warn everyone, and stop the invasion of aliens...aliens who are taking over the menfolk of her town in the hopes of breeding with the women and establishing a colony on Earth. The theme is: "They look just like us....but they aren't! And they'll take over!" This is Communism as represented by the Sci-Fi genre, and it was very popular in the Fifties. The movie industry was feverishly pumping out lots of low-budget films meant to distract the American public at the local drive-in theatre. However, "I Married a Monster From Outer Space" seems to be one of the accidental gems.Tom Tryon makes for a very likable alien. He's tall, handsome, and manages to make his character very sympathetic as the film progresses. He starts to understand and appreciate Earth, its culture, and his beautiful wife Marge, as she simultaneously pulls away upon discovering that what she is living (and sleeping) with isn't really her husband. And as always in Sci-Fi, the dogs always know who's the alien and who's the human. Marge's present of a dog to Bill results in an episode that jolts her into realizing that something is truly wrong.Subtle performances by both Tryon and Talbott help immensely. Both were highly respected and capable actors of the time, and Tryon in particular manages to go from gentle and kind to menacing with a very subtle and believable ease in this film. Tryon was in several well-known films, and received especially good critical reviews for his role in the film "The Cardinal". Interesting bit of trivia: he was also considered by Alfred Hitchcock for the role of Sam Loomis in "Psycho." There are the typical Sci-Fi low-budget special effects, but what makes the film really work is the telling of the story in a manner that pulls you into all of the characters, despite the obvious shortcomings of the budget.Note: Tom Tryon retired from acting in the late 1960's and became a successful novelist, publishing as Thomas Tryon; I remember my mother buying some of his books such as the bestselling "The Other", "Harvest Home", and "Crowned Heads", all of which I thoroughly enjoyed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have no idea how rare life is in the cold countless miles of space</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Traveling tens of billions of miles through space the lead scout ship lands on earth outside the sleepy little town of Norrisville USA. It's there the aliens in it begin to take over he bodies, after their kidnapped, of the young men in that town.Getting married to her high-school sweetheart Bill Farrel, Tom Tryon, Marge,Goria Talbott, begins to realize that he's not the man that she was in love with all these years!Marge later realizes that he's not a man at all but Bill is like what the title of the movie says: "A Monster from Outer Space".Coming from a planet in the distance Andromeda Constellation the aliens escaped from their dying planet due to their sun's deadly radiation that killed off all the females of their race. Looking for a planet with life and to be able reproduce their people the earth was one of the few planets available to them. But they made a fatal miscalculation in both the human race and themselves. The aliens lacked any human feeling which is needed to attract a woman to fall in love with, and thus marry and have children,them. They were also not adapted to breath the oxygen on earth, which turned out to be fatal to the aliens. Most off all they were rendered sterile by the massive doses of radiations that they absorbed on their home planet from their dying, and later exploding, sun. Much better then you would expect the movie "I Married a Monster from Outer Space" has a intelligent script and fine acting on the part of it's cast. It makes you interested not only in the people on earth that are being targeted for this grand plan on the part of the aliens but the aliens themselves in their attempt to save their race from extinction. The movie also makes you sympathetic to the aliens by realizing that their trying to do what any people would do the save themselves. By being able to sire future generations, through mating with the women on earth.The movie does take a violent turn when the aliens, disguised as human beings, are beginning to be exposed by Marge. Marge tries to warn her girlfriend Helen, Jean Carson, not to marry her fa?ence Sam Benson, Alan Dexter, because he's one of the aliens like her husband Bill! Still she's not believed by anyone in town but only by the aliens, like her husband Bill, who try to keep Marge quite as well as anyone else who would suspect them. The ending of the movie was in a way a bit sad with all the aliens from the scout ship destroyed by the townspeople, and two brave German Shepherd dogs since you could never really dislike them knowing that they warn't really evil. The aliens were just trying to do what any living entity, human being included,would try to do. Save their race from becoming extinct, and thus have the audience overlook the fact they they were what they were: Invaders from Space trying to take over and conquer a foreign planet and, for loss of a better word, rape it's human female inhabitants.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The competition of course is fiercer than the top spot on American Idol. But, in my warped view, I Married a Monster from Outer Space stacks up as the goofiest movie title from an era when goofy movie titles were thicker than scales on Godzilla's monster neck. Naturally, there was a reason for those goofy titles. They immediately signaled "teen movie", which usually meant a drive-in special where teens tended to congregate and waste their allowances. But then, kids at drive-ins didn't expect much from their movies, because (surprise, surprise) they were too busily engaged in their own hormonal development to catch up with more than bits and pieces.Okay, so I didn't see the movie all the way through until years later. But (surprise, surprise, again) it's a really good creepy movie that even adults like. And, I'm told, movie heavyweights catch up with the aliens and their body-snatched humans for all the symbolism they think they see, like "does a marriage ceremony turn all husbands into unromantic zombies". I guarantee no teen of the time saw anything on screen other than a good scary movie.Anyway, I liked Gloria Talbott then and still do, especially when she runs around in her low- cut nightgown, chest heaving. However, I think she made a really bad life choice running into Slapsie-Maxie's all night bar in that same gown since it sort of gives the male barflies wrong ideas. But then, she's not getting any romance at home because her hubby Tom Tryon is, shall we say-- not of this earth. No, instead he's been taken over by a creeping gas cloud that dissolves people for later reassembly in, you guessed it, a space ship. Talk about bad gas! On the other hand, I was really turned off by that scene where the popsicle monster gazes at the doll baby in the window because you know what he/she/it /whatever is thinking. I don't think sex ed' in highschool prepares you for what to do in case of a randy space creature.So, all in all, this is a good, even if slightly kinky, movie that manages to come up with some interesting ideas. Too bad I don't know what they paid dear Gloria, but whatever it was, she deserved a lot more. She's that good. But pity poor Tom Tryon. He had difficulty giving up his zombie act even in movies where he was supposed to be human. So, being the really smart guy he was, he put down the actor's part and picked up the writer's pen and became a best-selling author. Okay!? so maybe the bad gas was not that bad after all. Anyway, if you haven't caught up yet with this slice of 1950's nonsense, please do. It's even good enough to watch all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mother of all sci-fi movies, &amp; half the Star Trek plots</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made in 1959, this is a cult classic which, as the Leonard Maltin film guide notes, is cursed with the worst movie title in history!Made not long after WWII, the Roswell incident, and the McCarthy era, it's a metaphor of the unease felt by people who were just becoming aware that the world is large -- and they were definitely not in Kansas anymore.It's interesting not only as the seed of countless sci-fi creations to come, but also as a time capsule of the many plot clichés which are now gone forever because of technology. (like cellphones and the internet)Tom Tryon is great as the mysterious, brooding alien, and Gloria Talbot is hilariously deadpan as the only woman who's on to him and who can save the world! The special effects are early, primitive, cheap, and quite marvelous. (the things you can do with jell-O... really)It's funny, it's fascinating, and unconsciously mirrors - - and spoofs - - American life in the 50s: gender stereotypes, sexual politics, and the naiveté of an America which had yet to become jaded by television.Music, special effects, plot devices, all mark this as the mother of the B-grade sci-fi movies of the 50s. No film collection is complete without it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thunder, Dogs, and Oxygen...A few of My Least Favorite Things!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty good 50's sci-fi film about aliens in need of a home. Their planet is destroyed, their female population is dead, and they scout Earth to see if it is right for them. The film mirrors Invasion of the Body Snatchers in many ways. A woman is out to prove an alien existence whilst no one believes her and aliens-looking-like-humans surround her. Gloria Talbott is the unfortunate bride to an alien. She gives a good performance and looks stunning. Tom Tryon, later the best-selling author of The Other, does an admirable job as an alien learning to adjust to human form yet still very alien in his approach with dealing with "inferior" life forms. Ken Lynch, of McCloud fame, also has a nice role as a doctor. Director Gene Fowler does many things right. He creates some tension early on in the film, delivers some eerie and atmospheric shots, and keeps the pace brisk. the special effect are quite good at times with the alien design being one of the better ones used in the 50's and laughable at times with a fake mist shrouding victims and in particular an early scene of a car hitting an obvious mannequin. Notwithstanding this the film is certainly one of the better alien sci-fi films of the 50's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harmless enough 50's alien invasion film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I Married a Monster from Outer Space starts as Bill Farrell (Tom Tyron) drives home after a night out with his friends, Bill is due to marry his fiancé Marge (Gloria Talbot) the following day but is abducted &amp; replaced by an alien creature that takes Bill's form &amp; place. Bill &amp; Marge marry as planned but Marge become suspicious of her new husband Bill, a year later(!) she decides to follow Bill one night &amp; sees him turn into an alien &amp; enter it's hidden spaceship in the woods. Shocked Marge tries to inform the authorities about the alien invaders but discovers that the most important men in town have all been replaced by alien doubles including the Chief of Police. Marge confronts Bill who admits that he is part of an alien race that is dying out &amp; they have come to Earth to mate with women to save their race from extinction, Marge sets out to stop them &amp; make a disbelieving world take notice of her...Produced &amp; directed by Gene Fowler Jr. this Paramount Pictures production has one of the more memorable titles for a 50's sci-fi alien invasion film &amp; while I wasn't expecting too much from it I did like it, it's not amazing but if your a fan of these old black and white 50's alien invasion flicks then you could do a lot worse than I Married a Monster from Outer Space. There's a bit more going on here than usual, there's the whole subtext about the communist threat which was so prevalent in films back then, the fears about marriage &amp; the problems that can arise, the strength of human emotions &amp; at only 77 minutes long it's pretty brisk &amp; doesn't hang around. While the script isn't deep or has much substance it does try to touch a few ideas like paranoia &amp; a stealthy invasion based on replacing people &amp; fitting in as normal rather than an all guns blazing attack. The film has dated somewhat, a married couple sleeping in twins beds after a year of marriage yet are still together? Surely one of them would have expected a little bit of action after a year? Couples have divorced for less. The quaint small town paranoia feels old &amp; the aliens don't seem to have any great plan, it's been a year &amp; they haven't managed to get any ladies pregnant yet so why are they still hanging around? The script tries to paint the aliens as sympathetic, despite being ugly aliens in their true form when in human form they try to reason calmly &amp; are presented as a desperate race on the verge of extinction although kidnapping men, replacing them &amp; trying to get our women pregnant isn't the way they should have gone about things...The special effects here aren't that bad, the smoke effect that covers the men when they are being abducted is good while the alien monsters themselves look alright with a strange glow to them. I am not sure about the long dangling arms or the three fingers but they look OK for the time. Well shot with the odd creepy bit here &amp; there the ending features some quite gory alien meltdowns as they are killed off &amp; even some blood spurting. While watching I Married a Monster from Outer Space I realised that bachelor parties &amp; the attitudes towards marriage sure have changed in the past fifty years!With a supposed budget of about $175,000 this was partly filmed at the ever popular Bronson Canyon in Los Angeles, surely one of the worlds most used film locations. The acting is alright if a little wooden as expected, nothing great but not terrible.I Married a Monster from Outer Space is a fun little 50's sci-fi horror about the importance of marriage the idea of conforming to society, it's outdated &amp; silly but overall I quite liked it for what it is. Remade as I Married a Monster (1998) which is apparently terrible.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Aliens come to earth in a flying saucer in search of human mates. The women are dying on their planet. The aliens look like hell. They're roughly human in shape. Well, they HAVE to be, since they're really men walking around in aluminum foil suits. But their heads are an insult. No necks at all. The head seems to be planted halfway down into the transverse plane of the shoulders. And their faces, such as they are, lose bilateral symmetry, with ugly fleshy ridges criss-crossing this way and that. No wonder their women died.One by one they take over the male figures in a small California town. The human is engulfed in smoke, then replaced by a alien, with the human bodies being removed to the space ship and kept comatose. They take over the police force. When innocent Gloria Talbott, the bride of a replicant that looks like Tom Tryon, tries to reach outside agencies, she finds that all the telephone lines are busy and the dispatcher throws away her telegram to the FBI.One of the first and most effective of these plots was "It Came From Outer Space," which made evocative use of its desert settings and some of the dialog of which had qualities of folk philosophy. Then came a modest masterpiece, "The Invasion of the Body Snatchers," and all the pod people.This one came a little late in the series and lacks the originality of the earlier examples of the genre. And not just that. The acting is mostly wooden. The best performance comes from Valerie Allen as a hooker who has about four minutes of screen time.Gloria Talbott has no more than a modest talent, but at least she's pretty. Her face is full of good bone structure and she wears pointy 1950s brassieres. Tom Tryon, on the other hand, doesn't even strike me as particularly handsome. He has the tall, narrow, broad-shouldered, skinny build of a guy who would be good at hurling a poisoned spear at a giraffe twenty yards away. But his head, from certain angles, resembles a cinder block. I like him anyway because he was a little unusual as a human being. Not just that he was gay but that he went on to a successful career as a novelist, and I've always admired people with enough talent for two disparate fields. Lots of actors write biographies, or have them written for them, but a successful novel is a different order of thing. Meg Tilly did it too. Goethe was more proud of his work in the philosophy of science than in literature ("Faust").The special effects are of the period and even more crude than those in "It Came From Outer Space." The plodding direction by Gene Fowler, Jr., isn't much help. It's all done by the numbers. Talbott is sitting at her desk writing a letter to her Mom. We see the pen write her sad story: "It's been a terrible year since I married Sam. He's not the man I fell in love with. It's like living with a stranger...." The camera cuts to her thoughtful face staring into the air during a longish pause. Now, I ask you, the seasoned viewer of movies, is she going to rip up the note and throw it in the trash or not? Of course she will. Why? Because that's what everybody does in the movies. There isn't any JUICE to the plot or direction, no vatic moment, like Klaatu's visit to Professor Bernhard in "The Day The Earth Stood Still." Nobody says or does anything UNIQUE.It's too bad because stories like this have real potential. Imagine, an alien in human form. Some things Tryon remembers, like how to drive a car, and some he doesn't, like turning on the car lights at night. He doesn't recognize thunder for what it is. There are all sorts of possibilities in this arrangement and though this film has some interesting stuff going on -- Tryon slowly begins to love his wife -- most of the possibilities are thrown away in a typical commercial gesture.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Married a Monster from Outer Space.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The complications of a most very unusual marriage..a young bride is unknowingly betrothed to a man whose body is host to an alien from another constellation. The alien race needs women to procreate their species or face extinction due to the fact that their sun which destroyed their planet.Solid sci-fi from director Gene Fowler, Jr(I Was a Teenage Werewolf)stars Gloria Talbott as Marge, recently married to Bill Farrell(Tom Tryon), noticing that he's not acting the same before their blessed union. In fact, she discovers, to her horror, that Bill has been taken over by an alien who has invaded his body. Attempting to tell others becomes difficult because many local men in town themselves have become victims as well. Can Marge find anybody to help her? Is Bill lost to the alien forever? Will the aliens succeed in their mission to impregnate females for procreation purposes? Essentially a sci-fi melodrama, I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE is far more mature, intelligent, and literate than the hokey title would suggest, especially well acted by it's competent cast, particularly Talbott who so desperately wants to communicate what she knows regarding the alien threat, yet getting her message out becomes a trial. Talbott conveys to us, impressively I think, the burden such a knowledge has on her character. Meticulously paced, perhaps too leisurely for some;almost like an extended Twilight Zone episode. I'm afraid serious sci-fi fans may be put off by the title(..which I adore by the way;thanks to the title, it remained on my "to see" list until Turner Classics recently showed it)and miss out on a really good movie. I'm attracted to the "body snatching" science fiction very popular during this time, and I think I MARRIED A MONSTER FROM OUTER SPACE is a classic example of the quality pictures that derived from the canon. Taking the material seriously, Fowler Jr directs the film(..as well as the cast's acting)with a minimalist approach.What was most fascinating to me was seeing Bill's alien(..he and his drinking buddies, also taken over)attempting to coexist(..adapt)to human society, discovering what it was to feel, to love. The aliens subdue the humans, forming a gaseous cloud over the bodies, placing the hosts in their ship while they move about taking their positions in life. Another development is their friction with animals(..particularly canines)who can tell they are not us. Really cool is how canines actually help us where bullets from guns can not. A nice little trick which informs the viewer that certain characters are under alien control is the imprint of the creature's faces overlapping the humans during lightning flashes in thunderstorms.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tom Tryon and Gloria Henry in good sci-fi B-film from the '50s...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The surprise of this little sci-fi epic is GLORIA HENRY, who manages to convey all the right expressions as the wife who comes to realize that her husband is no longer the man she married. TOM TRYON is the man who early on is attacked by an alien who takes over his body. From then on, Tryon's robot-like acting fits the demands of his role beautifully, since he only has one expression on his impossibly handsome face at all times. Talk about one-dimensional! He looks like a department store mannequin come to life--almost. It's a good thing he had a career as a Gothic writer ahead of him.However, it's the tight script, the crisp B&amp;W photography, the jagged bits of music, and the eerie plot that bears more than a slight resemblance to "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" that is guaranteed to keep you awake--even though it is obviously a B-film with no big pretensions to be anything else.***** Possible SPOILER Ahead*****It's another one of those tales where the poor wife dares not trust any of the citizens of a small town--since any one of them might have turned into an alien, like her hubby. The plot builds to a nice climactic shootout and her husband is returned to her. We know he's assumed his own body again because he actually breaks into a grin before the fadeout.Summing up: Brisk, entertaining little sci-fi tale, the kind that was popular with audiences in the '50s.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is kind of interesting for a couple of reasons. The first was that despite the fact that we never talked about sex in 1950's, Hayes Code era movies, this movie was chalk-full of sexual innuendo. A typical McCarthy Era you can't trust anyone setting, a woman discovers that her new husband is not what he seems, and might even be an alien from another planet.While modern Science Fiction relies on over the top special effects and characters that are barely a device for stringing the action sequences together (thanks, George Lucas), this movie relied on what you didn't see. You didn't really see the aliens in their true form very often and you didn't see their spaceships. What you saw was the menace of their taking over your community.It's not cut and dried, because the aliens aren't actually evil, they are just doing what they have to survive, only killing when necessary. In the end, you feel some sympathy for their plight.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't overly thrilled with this paranoia thriller. The slow paced meandering storyline really never goes far and takes the whole movie to get there. Aliens, who cannot breath our atmosphere decide to take over small town America so they can find a way to breed our women. Unfortunately a whole three-quarters of the movie concerns Gloria Talbot learning that her husband, played by Tom Tryon, is an alien.The pace was too slow with too much time spent on the wife discovering that her husband is not the man she married. (in movie time it takes her over a year to discover the truth) By slow pace I don't mean a lack of action scenes, I mean that for one, the actors move unnaturally slow on screen. There are times when an actor will start a scene normally and abruptly slow in midstep as if reminded off camera to slow down. I also mean that the things that do happen lack substance for the most part, scenes of the alien demonstrating his superior strength by crushing a can or glass. The music is thankfully sparse since when they do play music it often contradicts the mood on screen... light upbeat music during tense, suspenseful moments confuses the mood. The motivation behind the invasion is kept from the audience for most of the movie, I think it was meant to be a shocking reveal and it probably was in the 50's but audiences now will be too jaded. The ending picks up a bit but it's rather late in the movie, by which point Tom Tryon's wooden acting, pouting facial expression, slow movements and slow dialog had worn me out.With no tension, no drama and little suspense I recommend skipping I Married a Monster from Outer Space and watching or rewatching any one of the better sci-fi films of the fifties.</fullReview>

Despite the silly title, the tone is serious and the special effects regarding the aliens and the way they possess people (or whatever) are quite good for the era. Right from the get-go the viewer knows who's being taken over and we then observe the protagonist slowly figure it out, which leads to a well-done confrontation between the wife and non-husband. The second half reveals why the aliens do what they do and it's kinda melancholic. All this points to why it's considered a minor cult classic. Movies like this are worthwhile simply as historical artifacts to view American society in the late 50s, but compared to Sci-Fi giants from the 50s like "The Day the Earth Stood Still" (1951) and the monumental "Forbidden Planet" (1956) "I Married a Monster from Outer Space" is second rate.The film runs 78 minutes and was shot in Bronson Canyon, Griffith Park and Los Angeles, California.

This alien does go on to marry his bride(played by Gloria Talbott) who doesn't like or understand the suddenly cold and passionless change in her man. The aliens don't understand such things, but proceed to replace other people in town, leading to a dog chase finale to their spaceship. Not as silly as its title, with some good direction and alien costumes, but marred by its entirely derivative and predictable plot. Still, a title to remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than the cheesy title would have you believe</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Filled with odd, quirky performances and lines of dialog by the supporting cast and some nicely understated performances by Talbott and Tryon, this movie turned out much much better than I expected. You can tell the director and crew are making every last bit of their obviously tiny budget count and finding setups and shots that pump the energy into what could have been just another rip off of "Body Snatchers".Talbott is an especially good choice for the part of the unlucky bride - I've seen her in other movies (like "Leech Woman") and her screen persona is always pretty tightly wound; she brings wide-eyed anxiety and fretfulness to the part without having to overplay it - you always believe this character is full of doubts, fears, and regrets without the screenplay having to turn her into a shrill hag.The movie also distinguishes itself from the run of the mill "secret invasion" science fiction movie by helping the audience understand the alien's reasons for being on Earth, and making them more human (or influenced by their human shells) as the movie progresses. Tryon's character's last few moments before his end are well done and wistful - he's never been more "human" and has become human just in time to realize what he's lost. That's pretty chewy stuff for a cheap sci fi B movie.By no means a classic, but still well done and worth seeing for fans of the genre.</fullReview>

In this case, the aliens seem to like newly wed couples, and they are working on a way to successfully breed with humans to populate Earth with their species. For some reason, they completely ignore the local bar floozies who try to bed with them... hmmm... Of course, one astute young housewife realizes that not all is right in her marriage and in Morrisville, and she investigates.

Only he isn't in the title role that dubious distinction belongs to Gloria Talbott.Some methane based creatures whose planet was dying and it took all their women have arrived from the Andromeda galaxy looking for male bodies on a planet with life to take over. They land in the typical American 50s suburb of Norrisville and the first guy they take over is Tryon and on his wedding day. Pretty soon Talbott discovers Tryon just ain't the guy she married.Over on planet methane there's sex, but no romance. That's what Tryon and the others are trying to get the hang of. Not easy for an alien to do. After this film just becomes a dime store imitation of Invasion Of The Body Snatchers where the citizenry learns and becomes outraged. They decide to deal with the methane guys on their own. The final confrontation led by the town doctor Ken Lynch is a hoot.You'd think they'd find some other methane planet like Jupiter to invade though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great little 1950s sci-fi paranoia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the eve of his wedding, Bill (Tom Tryon) is abducted by aliens and an alien living in a facsimile of his human body returns to marry Marge (Gloria Talbott). She notices his change right away ("he's not the man I fell in love with" she writes in a letter) and, after a year of fruitless marriage, begins uncovering this secret alien invasion. This sci-fi flick has some really good moody scenes in it and, while not at the level of something like THE DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL, it still delivers a strong allegory. Director Gene Fowler Jr. (I WAS A TEENAGE WEREWOLF) has a nice way of revealing the aliens and their abduction attacks are really well done. The alien design is also pretty cool too. It only runs 78-minutes, so don't expect anything epic during the final showdown, but it is worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A genre movie by the numbers but the fans won't complain about that.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Now, haven't I all seen this somewhere before? No, I can't really say "I Married a Monster from Outer Space" is a very original one within its genre, which is something the movie perhaps still could had gotten away with if it was a one from the early days of the '50's science-fiction movie era but this being an 1958 movie I simply have to conclude that this isn't a terribly original one. But not being original doesn't always necessarily have to be a bad thing, as long as the movie still serves its purpose and works out, like this movie does exactly.It really is a movie by the numbers and not only just with its story. It has a typical low budget feel and look to it, consistent with '50's science-fiction. Also the acting is bad and just too wooden and the special effects are simplistic looking. But this all is part of the reason why '50's science-fiction also has a certain charm to it. To be frank, none of those movies are really great ones by any means but they surely are entertaining and in a way also irresistible ones, that can get away with a lot because of that.And this movie is also not without that charm. It's perfectly watchable for that reason alone already, especially if you're into the genre of course.It's luckily never a boring movie but this is mostly because of the fact that the movie is being a very short one. Nevertheless there still is plenty of stuff happening, just don't expect any big action moments. Yes, it's an alien invasion movie but one in which the aliens blend in with- and take the place of humans, which means there aren't really any flying saucers flying and destructing places and killing people with their lasers. Though there still is some of that in this movie, it just isn't what the movie is all supposed to be about. It takes a more subtle approach with its story and build-up.Nothing too great, just a maintaining '50's science-fiction piece.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A really remarkable decent B horror movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tight, intriguing story makes it easy to ignore the not very special effects and the cheesy title (actually, I'm very fond of the title). This is another one of those movies I saw a kid and have been wanting to see again for years. I'm very pleased to say it holds up well. Gene Fowler is the director and handles the assignment with a firm hand. The film stays remarkable on point with the one person knows the truth kind of paranoia parable popular at the time -- see "Invasion of the Body Snatchers". It's no wonder Fowler does such a fine job telling the story, he was the editor for couple of Samuel Fuller's westerns "Forty Guns" and "Run of the Arrow" in 1957 (which I co-incidentally watched the same week as this picture). Fowler's ability to convey the mounting tension of the situation show his editor's training. There's no coy is she or isn't she paranoid here; we know right off the bat she's married to a monster from outer space, but it's great fun to see her come to the same conclusion. One thing that really impressed me was the tremendous amount of boozing going on it the movie -- it was like a horror version of Mad Men. In fact, a key tip off that a person is really a monster that walks like a man is that he gives up the booze (aliens can't tolerate the stuff). This doesn't stop the cadre of monster conspirators from holding their little get together in a bar (and what a great bar it is, alcoholic bar tender, hot jazz, sleazy men and louse women). When the exciting conclusion comes, all is explained in a much more satisfactory manner than most shows provide and I for one felt a certain sympathy with the gruesome grooms.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always cool to run across a picture as absurdly titled as "I Married a Monster From Outer Space", and even better when the picture turns out to be a whole lot better than the expectation it created. This wouldn't necessarily be everyone's cup of tea, but for schlock sci-fi movie fans of the era, this one has a nice balance of primitive alien horror effects and a story that that provides food for thought even after it's over.One of the things I noticed though as the picture progressed, there wasn't any thought of continuity in the way the aliens took over their human hosts. When Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon) is confronted by the alien early in the picture, the black cloud (nice touch) that envelops him leaves him collapsed up against his car. Later, when Bill's drinking buddy Sam is attacked, the black cloud makes the human disappear but leaves his clothes. Finally, when the beat cop becomes victim number three, he disappears altogether! I don't know about you, but I like to see my monster continuity maintained.There were a couple of other things that fascinated me as well - like how did alien Bill know where to drive for his honeymoon destination? - wife Marge (Gloria Talbott) was asleep for half the trip! Speaking of Marge, what do you think might have possessed her to walk up to Bill right after seeing him emit the black cloud and have the exchange with the alien and the space ship? I don't think I would have been that curious to investigate if I had just seen something like that.But here's some really curious points to ponder. When the aliens took over the human bodies, they developed an aversion to alcohol; now there's an interesting subtext. Also, when the police aliens confronted the man from the bar stalking Marge, they rejected taking his body because he was a 'criminal type'! That has to say something about how discriminating they were, don't you think?Coming as it did during the Cold War era, "I Married a Monster From Outer Space" has been offered as another example of anti-Communist propaganda. I don't know, I think it's a real stretch to go for that analysis, even with the us vs. them, human vs. alien plot elements. You can decide later on that score, but first enjoy the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Satisfying suburban sci-fi...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the eve of his wedding, insurance salesman Tom Tryon is abducted by an alien being on a forest road; the hideous-looking creature neatly duplicates Tryon's human form and goes through with the nuptials the following morning! Interesting twist on "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" from 1956 has many of the small town males quickly and insidiously overtaken by the outer space ghouls, whose ultimate purpose is to mate with Earth women and give their race a fresh start. Despite claims the film's narrative is symbolic for Communist infiltration, the low-budget picture isn't especially provocative nor intelligent; however, Gene Fowler, Jr.'s direction is smooth and highly confident. The detail and design is also impressive, with imaginative effects and decent monsters, a nice sense of place and astute cinematography by Haskell Boggs. Very entertaining thriller, and one without that then-fashionable sense of foreboding at the finish. Fowler lets his cast (and his audience) off the hook happily. **1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Married A Monster From Outer Space (Gene Fowler, Jr., 1958) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had always been interested in this modest sci-fi effort whose legendary catchpenny title has turned into a cult. The film is one of several made during this time revolving around an alien takeover theme (the most famous example, obviously, being Don Siegel's INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS [1956]); its plot, then, is in the same 'paranoid' vein ? and, while the end result isn't exactly comparable, it's nonetheless effective when taken on its own terms.The aliens ? shown only intermittently throughout (exposed for what they are, for instance, during thunderstorms!) ? are pleasingly weird creations: needless to say, their scenes provide the requisite chills (particularly a gratuitous encounter between one of them, wearing a raincoat and seen staring blankly at a shop window[!], and a bar floozie). While generally undercast, Tom Tryon and Gloria Talbott (from Edgar G. Ulmer's delightfully wacky DAUGHTER OF DR. JEKYLL [1957]) handle the tension which slowly builds between their characters adequately enough, and also featured is Peter Baldwin (later of LA DONNA DEL LAGO aka THE POSSESSED [1965], which I've recently watched and been impressed by) as a police officer. Predictably, when the heroine realizes her husband's true nature and turns to the authorities for help, they've already been 'replaced'; interestingly, the 'old' bodies are kept in the spaceship attached to a machine ? which, when switched off, kills the aliens instantly (another way to dispose of them is by severing a tube in their 'make-up', after which they're reduced to blobs of oozing goo)! Having watched this soon after THE CREATION OF THE HUMANOIDS (1962), it bears a strikingly similar ploy by which the monsters intend to mate with humans in order to keep their dying race alive! Though they try to explain the reason behind their mission, the aliens are still depicted as essentially villainous ? so that their ultimate decimation (amusingly, at the hands of a bunch of prospective fathers rallied from a hospital maternity ward!) is inevitable. For the record, the film (ostensibly projected in a Widescreen ratio of 1.78:1) appeared stretched to full-frame in the DivX copy I acquired ? which was then fixed by switching my TV viewing mode to the 16:9 format?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Cheesy Sci-Fi is worth a look.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Gene Fowler Jr. and B flick in every way. A vintage thriller with mediocre special effects and familiar stars from Saturday Matinée movies. Marge(Gloria Talbott)has so looked forward to her wedding day. Her sweetheart Bill(Tom Tryon)seems to be a total stranger on the honeymoon; and after a year of marriage she is bewildered with the coolness of her husband and concerned enough to see her doctor wondering why she hasn't become pregnant yet. Marge you see has married a monster-like alien from outer space, who is part of a group trying to conquer earth.Predictable, but a whole lot better than some other Sci-Fi releases of the same period. No magnetism between Talbott and Tryon, but then again the script doesn't really require such. Other familiar faces in the cast: Robert Ivers, Ken Lynch, Ty Hardin, John Eldridge and Alan Dexter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Matrimony, Jim, But Not As We Know It.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With a title like that, its a wonder anybody took this movie seriously. It sounds like the ultimate science-fiction parody, the headlines of a tabloid newspaper.When, in fact, it is quite a serious and spooky effort.It's a 'body-snatchers' theme. The aliens are kidnapping people and hooking them up to some sort of machine. It allows each to be completely replicated in their physical appearance and personalities, enabling lookalike aliens to go abroad as human replacements. How intimately humans are replicated is never made quite so clear as the title of the movie would suggest.However, the best laid plans of monsters and men come apart. The goodies find the abductees and start unplugging them from the machine. When they do, each alien replicant instead of changing back to its monstrous self, collapses into a big pile of what looks like rice-pudding. The unchanged aliens who are guarding their installation get shot or beaten or just bitten by the trusty dog.The movie contains some sly little social comedies as the title would suggest. We see a group of aliens in the bar, sneering to each other about the fragility of human bodies, like so many rednecks. But this certainly isn't a comedy in itself. Filmed in black &amp; white; it's dark, creepy and at times very atmospheric, with a strong thread of who-is-really-who paranoia running through it. There is one particular scene in which an un-modified alien has gone walkies in human clothing at night in the otherwise deserted town. He is unwittingly propositioned by a local hooker who becomes a little too pressing in her advances. He has his collar turned-up to conceal his face, but she won't be dissuaded.At sight of him she screams and runs and he draws a ray-gun and shoots. She is incinerated so quickly that she vanishes before the last echo of her scream has died away. The blatant murder of a woman in a 1950's movie is a surprisingly rare event.Hardly seen nowadays, but if you're equal to watching 'Dr Who' or 'Star Trek' then you've no business turning your nose up at this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent sci-fi movie but silly title</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I taped I Married A Monster From Outer Space when Channel 4 screened it some time ago. Despite its rather silly title, this movie is actually very good.Aliens start taking over a number of people in a small town, including a newly wed. His wife gradually notices his strange behaviour and one evening, she decides to follow him and is shocked when she sees him go into the aliens' spaceship and also sees one of the aliens. These aliens are taking over the men so they can make love with the women on their own planet. Other people in town are also acting odd and those who haven't been taken over head for the ship, rescue the real humans and blow the ship up.The movie is quite creepy in parts and has a creepy score too. Animal lovers should beware of the dog and cat scenes, which were not really necessary.The cast includes Tom Tryon, Gloria Talbott and Peter Baldwin. No real stars here, but quite good acting.I Married A Monster From Outer Space is worth watching, despite the title. Don't let that put you off.Rating: 3 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stupid title for a pretty good, serious film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a bad little film about aliens taking over the bodies of men in a small town to mate with their wives. The dumb title conceals that this is a subtle, well-made, intelligent little sci-fi tale. It's short and atmospherically directed with some truly creepy scenes. This movie had to approach the point of sex very carefully (due to the Production Code) and they did AND pulled it off. The alien makeup is gruesome (as it should be) and there's some fairly graphic gore (for 1958) at the end. The acting is mostly good--especially by Gloria Talbott as a wife who comes to realize what's going on. Tom Tryon, as her possessed husband, has a nice body and is very handsome but totally bland as her husband. Still, a good little sci-fi film. Worth catching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When Marge Bradley (Gloria Talbott) marries Bill Farrell (Tom Tryon), she gets a surprise when she finds out that he's been possessed by an alien, and that aliens are possessing the other men in town. There's not much here that you haven't seen in other such movies. I guess it's just eye-opening that the star is the guy who wrote "The Other". Still, the idea of aliens wanting to impregnate earth women is an interesting idea (Mike Nichols visited this idea with "What Planet Are You From?"). Anyway, there's the ubiquitous '50s stuff: men wearing gray flannel suits and women wearing pointy bras, plus spiffy cars. I wonder if there's ever going to be a movie where the aliens win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I Married a Monster From Outer Space (1958) *** (out of 4) Despite the campy title this is a pretty straight forward sci-fi film that manages to be quite effective. Gloria Talbott plays a young bride who begins to fear that her husband has been taken over by aliens. As Talbott begins to fear for her safety she also starts to wonder if other men are falling victim. Sadly the title makes on go into this expecting something campy but it's actually a pretty smart film that makes the viewing think. The film manages to have some wonderful cinematography, which really helps the overall quality of the movie. The screenplay by Louis Vittes manages to work quite well except for when it borrows a little too closely to Invasion of the Body Snatchers, which was released two years earlier. Talbott manages to turn in a very good performance as the worried wife and Tom Tryon is good as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All the good comments at imdb made me watch this on TV. What a waste of time! Ten minutes in, a hokey monster is shown, and it's all downhill from there. The actors do the best they can, but their characters are so one-dimensional, i.e. stereotypes, that they still end up looking like some formula made-for-TV movie.  I was interested to see the pet-dog scene, with the line "dogs don't seem to like me"; its lifted straight out of Cat People(1942) which this movie resembles in several ways e.g. an alien force interposing to destroy a relationship. But the complex characters in Cat People render it a classic, whereas this one can only tolerated after consuming a few gallons of beer (or wine).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose there are many ways of watching movies as there are of eating, a lot. But most folks seem to do it quickly, without savor. So from time to time it is worth watching an old movie with little merit just to see if you can escape the furrow plowed by others.The conventional wisdom on this movie is that it is heavily seasoned by the paranoias of the time: commies, gays. And this imposed on a genre which at the time was a sort of slate for writing society's fears.But I urge you to escape that, whether it has the assuring warmth of truth or not, and consider this as something more basic and unsettling, a love story.It starts with a group of buddies drinking to the loss of one of them to marriage. What follows is that the marriage doesn't work out; he literally seems alien. Other men discover the same and form a club. They are opposed by other "real" men who bear children.Look at it as a version of "Extase."Men without women are lost. There are only three women in this story. The narrator, the newlywed wife who wants children and finds her husband unrelatable; the whore in the bar, and an aging blond who finally after great effort "snags" her own husband (who dies when breathing the oxygen).It isn't powerful stuff at all. It doesn't come to you and ensnare you like "Streetcar." But if you learn to go to these things and find the fishhooks, you will find it easier to find narrative all around you. Accepting prefabricated meaning is as dangerous for filmwatching as the similar acceptance of our hapless bride was.Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life.</fullReview>
