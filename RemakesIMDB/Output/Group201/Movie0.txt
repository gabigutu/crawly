		<shortDescription>7 reasons why Intermezzo works</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I normally don't gravitate toward melodramas nor would I approve, frankly, of a film that centers around adultery. However, this film has such much going for it that I wound up loving this movie the first time I saw it, and still do six viewings later. Off the cuff, here are seven reasons why:1) There IS a good message here: that a married person having a fling with a pretty young woman might be an exciting prospect but in the end, "you reap what you sow" and if either of the two parties has a conscience, the illicit romance will be doomed, especially if there are kids involved.2 ) For male viewers, Ingrid Bergman, making her English-speaking debut, is a real feast for the eyes. She was one of the more naturally gorgeous women to grace the silver screen, I think.3) Gregg Toland's photography. To fully appreciate his work, get the DVD for this film. Toland was one of the best ever, and this is a beautifully shot piece of work. 4) At 70 minutes, the film flies by, which also makes it easier to watch and enjoy multiple times.5) Leslie Howard and John Halliday also were excellent in here as the two male leads. I thought Halliday, in particular, had some great words of wisdom.6) For those who appreciate how difficult it is to forgive people, this ending contained another nice message.7) Classical music lovers will very much appreciate the soundtrack to this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Listening to the Spring in the Intermezzo of His Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a successful tour ended in New York, the famous violinist Holger Brandt (Leslie Howard) returns to his home in Stockholm. In the birthday party of his beloved daughter Ann Marie (Ann Todd), he feels attracted by and plays with her piano teacher, Anita Hoffman (Ingrid Bergman), who is waiting for a music scholarship in Paris. They incidentally meet each other in a concert, have a drink together and begin a love affair. Holger leaves his family and travels with Anita in a tour, and later they spend vacation together. But Anita earns the expected scholarship and travels to Paris, and Holger decides to visit Ann Marie. A car accident changes the destiny of the Brandt family.The debut of Ingrid Bergman in an English spoken film may be dated in 2006, but it is still a wonderful romance about a man in a middle age crisis, with a stabilized marriage, who sparks with the love of a talented gorgeous woman that worships him. The performances of Ingrid Bergman, Leslie Howard and Ann Todd are fantastic, and Ingrid looks like a pianist in the sequence in the birthday party. Her beauty shines in the awesome black and white photography and locations and her accent is lovely. The music score gives an additional touch of class to this film. The moralist conclusion seems suitable for the values of the society of 1939, leaving a message of forgiveness and understanding. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Intermezzo"</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is Ingrid Bergman's (Casablanca) first English speaking role.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful black and white film and Gregg Toland was nominated for an Academy Award for best cinematographer. Concert violinist Holger Brandt, Leslie Howard (Gone with the Wind), spends much of his life on tours, and loses perspective of his family ties. When his accompanist retires he goes home for awhile until the next tour. Intermezzo! He has an adorable family: wife, Greta Stenborg, Enid Bennett (Strike Up the Band), a daughter and one son, and also a cute dog (which he had never seen before).His daughter is studying piano and the piano teacher is Anita Hoffman, played by beautiful, Ingrid Bergman (Casablanca) in her first English speaking role. Anita Hoffman is not only a piano teacher but is also an accomplished pianist. Anita is competing for a scholarship to further her music studies in France. After Holger hears Anita play, he invites her to go on a tour with him. They fall in love feeling guilt and shame at the same time. His wife suspects, and he himself tells her about it. Anita decides not to teach the daughter anymore. Holger leaves his wife so the two can go off to Italy on a tour together. While she is away his daughter keep listening on the radio and the record to her favorite piece, Intermezzo, one that her father wrote. The score for the movie was done by Louis Forbes who was nominated for an Academy Award. His wife files for divorce and he is hesitant to sign the papers. Anita realizes, as she says "I have been an intermezzo in his life." She wins the scholarship and decides to accept it and with much sorrow she leaves him. He then signs the papers for divorce. He goes home much later. He brings the camera his daughter asked for. He parks his car across the street from her school. In her hurry to see her father, she runs across the street without looking and is hit by a car. He brings his daughter to his former home and stays there until his daughter recovers. As soon as she recovers, he starts to leave and his wife asks him to stay home.Favorite Quote :" I wonder if anyone has built happiness on the unhappiness of others." Favorite Scenes: Daughter playing a duet with dad, has small hands almost do not make an octave on the piano. Anita wearing a man's tie in 1937! The good-bye scene in front of store window.This is a very interesting and beautiful love story, where the viewer is tossed by their moral belief system and the love of those two people, at least I was. I have the tape and enjoy watching it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(Some Spoilers) Touching 1939 tear-jerker that introduced to the movie going public here in the USA the beautiful and stalely 23 year-old Swedish actress Ingrid Bergman as Anita Hoffman. Who's the piano teacher for the young Ann Marie, Ann E. Todd, the daughter of famed concert violinist Holger Brandt, Leslie Howard.After being a smashing success in America ending his concert tour at Carnegi Hall in New York City Holger tell his star struck admirers that he's leaving for his home in Sweden together his mentor and fellow musician Thomas Stenborg, John Holliday, to be with his family and get a long and well deserved rest from his grueling string of public performances. Back home with his loving wife Margit, Edna Best, and his two beautiful children Ann Marie and Eric, Douglas Scott, everything is wonderful for the Brandt family. Thats until Holger lays his eyes on Ann Marie's piano teacher, and also Thomas' music student, the stunning Anita Hoffman and it's love at first sight, or at first sound. Holger actually fell in love with Anita's music before he fell in love with her looks. In no time at all Holger and Anita fall in love and both leave together for Europe as a duet, him playing the violin and Anita the piano, on the concert circuit. The two musical dynamos tear up the continent with record-breaking crowds attending their performances as Margit and the children are left behind in Sweden. With the only contact from their estranged husband and father being the radio that broadcasts his and Anita's musical acts. Taking time off from their Europen tour the two lovers spend some time on the French coast where they run into Thomas who has, well both good and bad, news for them. The good news is that Anita has been awarded a scholarship to a major music academy and the bad news is that he has the divorce papers from Margit's lawyer for Holger to sign, which he doesn't. This bring a touch of reality into Holger and Anita's life where she realizes what she's done to the Brandt family by being the "Other Woman" in Holger and Margit's divorce papers. At the same time Anita tearfully leaves poor Holger all by himself by going back to Sweden to the music academy to accept her scholarship.Holger soon becomes a man without a country, or family, as he bums around Europe afraid to go back home to face his family that he so selfishly destroyed by having an affair with Anita. Getting up enough courage to bring himself to go back to Sweden to give Ann Marie a birthday present, a camera, that he promised her soon turns out to be a tragedy. The happy Ann Marie, after seeing her dad, runs across the street from the school yard only to get hit by a speeding car and left in a coma. Completely destroyed by his actions with his wife and son not even speaking to him and little Ann Marie on the brink of death or ending up crippled for life Holger, now for the first time, sees what a heel he was. Holger also sees how his love for another woman, who later left him, blinded him of all the good and wonderful things that he had in life. That he so foolishly threw away in the pursuit of his love, forbidden as it was, for Anita.The movies contrived ending is a bit far-fetched but it's just how you would want it to end.Leslie Howard is perfect as Holger the tortured soul who was torn between the beautiful piano teacher Anita and his loving wife Margit. You could understand his actions even though you wouldn't agree with them. As for Ingrid Bergman as Anita? she was simply beautiful.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unashamedly romantic, carefully wrought weepie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cultured and unfussy weepie. Strong leads from Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman front a strong cast - right down to the excellent Ann Todd as Howard's young daughter.The story is of a concert violinist who leaves his wife for another woman. Naturally there is quite a bit of music in the film. Great care has been taken to equate the miming with the soundtrack. All the musicians look as if they are really performing, detail typically neglected nowadays. The score itself, despite being the fruit of many hands, is exemplary in its integration with the film: Heinz Provost's titular melody uses the opening phrase of the act 2 love duet of Wagner's Tristan and Isolde, showing the long reach of Wagner's fully-integrated musico-dramatic ideas in romantic American film scores more than 50 years after his death.The final sequences are slightly out of kilter. However mitigating against this lumpen denouement are some wonderful location shots and two outstandingly executed leave-taking sequences as Bergman literally dissolves into the chiaroscuro of the shot. A thoroughly affecting and well-made film. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A star is born</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of the Swedish film of the same name is worth a look because it's the first time American audiences got a chance to see Ingrid Bergman. Gregory Ratoff, the director, utilizes well the short time of the movie to present the melodrama in an appealing way.From the beginning, we realize the attraction Holger feels for Anita is doomed. Holger has a loving wife as well as two children that clearly adore their distant father.Basically, Holger is a decent man who sees in Anita something that he doesn't have at home, which seems to happen whenever a fresh and beautiful woman arrives at the scene and the marriage is shaky.Leslie Howard was an amazing actor. In this film he is not as effective as in his previous, much better appearances. Ingrid Bergman brought a freshness to Anita that is hard to imagine another actress playing her. We get a glimpse about a star being born, one that would shine forever.In minor roles, Edna Best, plays Magrit, the long suffering wife. John Halliday is Thomas Stenborg, the loyal friend and former playing partner. Ann Todd is seen as Ann Marie Brandt, the daughter. Also, Cecil Kellaway plays Charles, Holger's manager.This is a movie to watch because of the impressive debut of Ingrid Bergman, also because the glorious music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ultimate chick flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Intermezzo" is a beautifully photographed, bittersweet story about a the love affair between a concert violinist (Leslie Howard) and a pianist (Ingrid Bergman). This was Bergman's second time at the role, the first time being in her native Sweden. This film catapulted her to fame. Her natural beauty and freshness is shown to wonderful advantage here, as is her sensitive acting in the role of Anita Hoffman.Howard plays Holger Brandt, a married man with two children who leaves his wife and family when his affair with Bergman becomes too intense. Hoffman becomes his accompanist on tour, sublimating her own career plans because she wants to be with him. While vacationing, he becomes attached to a little girl who obviously reminds him of his daughter (Ann Todd), whom he adores, and Anita wonders if their illicit affair can ever bring them happiness.The film is rich in subtext and metaphors. "Aren't you giving it too much importance?" Anita's piano teacher asks as she rips into a concerto. "We were all impressed with you the night you played here ... with my husband," Holger's wife says, asking Anita about her studies. "I really had no choice," Anita almost whispers. Even the title of his daughter's favorite piece that he plays, "Intermezzo" takes on a special meaning.Few actors have cut the romantic, ethereal figure that Leslie Howard did during his film career. Tall, blond, with that soft voice and faraway look in his eyes, he makes a perfect musician who is always listening to a melody in his head. Though some people feel his phoned-in Ashley Wilkes doesn't hold up today, in fact, he was the embodiment of Ashley without making much effort, a soft dreamer with impractical values from another time. And so he is here, not thinking ahead and lost in a romantic fog.A touching and dramatic film with very effective performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More on why this is a great movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1) Any scene with a close-up of Ingrid Bergman's face is absolute gold. It is uncanny. She puts every movie actress in the last 20 years to shame. 2) The acting of both the leads is superb. Don't underestimate the fine line that Holgar must maintain. He must always appear rational, thoughtful, educated, responsible, earnest but at the same time in passionate love. His delicate acting lifts this above a melodrama. It would be easy for him to act impetuous or lustful or simply trying to fill a void. But that is not the case here. His love always appears genuine. The film becomes a real examination into what love is. Some favorite scenes:Anna playing the piano as if she is about to climax! Anna wearing a dress with a large H on it while looking out the window at Holgar. Holgar slipping into a darker and darker shadow towards the end. Ice in the river breaking up as Spring approaches. Holgar telling his wife firmly twice "I need to talk to you." The daughter listening on the radio to her estranged father playing Intermezzo. Worst scene: easily the accident. One last favorite scene: At the end, the wife on the staircase looking at her estranged husband for a moment and saying "....". See the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adultery without Tears</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At only 70 minutes "Intermezzo" is short even by the standards of the thirties. The story is simple and its moral equally so. Holger Brandt is a famous Classical violinist who falls in love with Anita Hoffman, his daughter's attractive young piano teacher. Holger leaves his wife and family for Anita, and they tour Europe together, with her acting as his accompanist. Anita, however, has a guilty conscience about having been responsible for splitting up Holger's marriage. She leaves him so that he can return to his family, who forgive him. The message is that individual happiness cannot be based upon the unhappiness of others.One contributor on this board states that he would not normally approve of a film about adultery, in which case his choice of viewing matter must be rather limited. His choice of reading matter must be even more limited, as adultery has always been one of the great themes of literature. The great literary chroniclers of adultery, however- Flaubert, Tolstoy, Fontane, Hardy, Balzac, Alas, Lawrence- treated the subject with much greater frankness, and with much greater depth, than do the makers of this film. (Perhaps because those writers had no Production Code to worry about). "Intermezzo" presents us with a rather sanitised version of adultery, in which at the end of the day no-one gets hurt and there is a happy ending for everyone- even for Anita, whose renunciation of the man she loves is presented as a noble gesture which will enable her to live in future with a clear conscience. The film has been described as a "weepie" or a "tear-jerker", but it seemed to me that there was precious little in it to shed tears over.Most literary treatments of adultery (Anna and Karenin, Emma and Charles, Sir Clifford and Lady Chatterley) paint a portrait of a deeply dysfunctional marriage; this film, however, paints a highly idealised one. The opening scenes of Brandt, his adoring wife Margit and their two children could be taken straight from an advert depicting the ideal family. There is no attempt to suggest any marital discord which might have contributed to Brandt's infidelity; adultery is simply presented as "one of those things that happen", like an accident.This is not Ingrid Bergman's greatest film, but her vibrant, lively personality shines through and she does enough to show why she was to go on to become a major Hollywood star. (Ironically, her career was to be damaged ten years later when she herself became involved in an affair with a married man, Roberto Rossellini). Leslie Howard, however, seems too much the perfect gentleman with no suggestion of a passionate nature below the surface. One cannot really imagine him as the sort of man who would jeopardise a seemingly idyllic marriage for a guilty fling.This film is a remake of a Swedish film of the same name, made three years earlier in 1936. The main purpose of the remake was to allow David O. Selznick to introduce to the American public his big new star, Ingrid Bergman, who had also starred in the Swedish version. Tom Cruise did something similar recently when, wanting to introduce to the American public a big new star, Penelope Cruz (who also happened to be his girlfriend), he produced, under the title "Vanilla Sky", an English-language remake of her previous Spanish hit "Abre los Ojos". There is, however, a difference. Cruise's film transferred the action from Spain to America and included several well-known Hollywood stars, including himself. The American version of "Intermezzo" by contrast, kept the Swedish setting of the original film. Moreover, none of the leading actors were American. Apart from Bergman, the two leading roles are played by British actors, Leslie Howard and Edna Best. Clearly, in 1939 there was no automatic assumption on the part of Hollywood filmmakers, as there is today, that American audiences took no interest in countries other than their own.It might, in fact, have been easier if the action had been transferred to America, as it would have spared the filmmakers the dilemma of how to refer to the European political situation. The film was made at a time when Europe was threatened by war, and actually opened a few days after war was actually declared. The view of Europe in 1939, however, is as sanitised as that of the Brandts' marriage. We see a continent at peace, with no reference to Nazism or the approaching conflict, beyond one brief allusion to "the time when Vienna was a happy city". This has been taken as a reference to the Anschluss in the previous year, although Vienna was probably not a particularly happy place under the authoritarian pre-1938 Dollfuss/Schuschnigg regime.In style the film is a romantic melodrama, complete with lush Classical music playing in the background. It is reasonably well made, but I was rather unhappy with its treatment of its subject-matter. In one of a number of musical metaphors, Anita says that she was just an intermezzo in Brandt's life. Most extra-marital affairs in real life are rather more than that. If only the damage done by infidelity could be repaired as easily as it is in this film. 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Leslie &amp; Ingrid Make Beautiful Music</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For her first American film, David O. Selznick was taking no chances with his Swedish import Ingrid Bergman. Her debut film was to something she had previously done in Sweden, giving her a role she had already done and was comfortable while presumably she learned English. As we all know Ingrid Bergman learned it quite well indeed.Intermezzo is the story of a world famous concert violinist played by Leslie Howard who comes home from a world tour with his piano accompanist John Halliday to wife Edna Best and children Ann Todd and Douglas Scott. By a stroke of coincidence Ann Todd's piano teacher Ingrid Bergman is also Halliday's pupil. At a party Bergman plays and Howard picks up the violin to accompany her.That's it for him, the beautiful music they make together kindles a romance. She goes on tour with him and it's a romantic idyll. Except of course for Best and the kids.This version of Intermezzo is a faithful remake of the original Swedish film and the reviews that Ingrid Bergman garnered insured her American stardom. This was a busy years for Leslie Howard and David O. Selznick with both of them also involved with Gone With The Wind.The theme from Intermezzo is most often done as an instrumental, but words were actually written for it and Tony Martin made a hit record of it at the time film was out in theater.Seen today Intermezzo and its romantic story hold up well today. Bergman and Best are at their best fighting for the same man and Leslie Howard's charm still comes through after almost 70 years. Intermezzo got two Oscar nominations for black and white cinematography and film editing, but this was the year of Gone With The Wind.You didn't think David O. Selznick should have taken all the Oscars home from 1939. He grabbed enough of them that year as it was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Small-Scale Love Story Offers Fresh-Faced Bergman in Her American Debut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The familiar David O. Selznick gloss is all over this minor 1939 soap opera, most noteworthy as the American film debut of 24-year old Ingrid Bergman. She was brought over from Sweden by Selznick for this melodramatic remake of the 1936 film which brought her great acclaim in her homeland. Her fresh-faced beauty and natural manner are intoxicating as she plays Anita Hoffman, first a piano teacher to the young daughter of renowned violinist Holger Brandt and then his accompanist on a world tour. It's a brief movie, only seventy minutes long, directed by Gregory Ratoff (more famous as the ulcer-ridden producer Max in "All About Eve") focusing on the illicit affair that develops between Anita and Holger.Much of the story has to do with the guilt they both experience in terms of the familial repercussions, and the ending reflects as much. A role away from his Ashley Wilkes in "Gone With the Wind", obviously the more important Selznick movie in production a the time, Leslie Howard plays Holger in his familiar erudite manner. Veteran character actor Cecil Kellaway (later the monsignor in "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner") plays the sage maestro who acts as the film's conscience. Scenes often seem strangely truncated to move the story briskly along. Beyond Bergman, the most accomplished aspects of the film are Gregg Toland's lush cinematography, Lyle Wheeler's art direction (making Monterey, California look very much like the Italian Riviera) and Max Steiner's romantic music (oddly uncredited). But the impossibly striking Bergman is the primary reason to see this predictably developed film. The 2004 DVD offers no extras.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable only for Ingrid Bergman's first starring role in an American film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the years we have all seen this kind of story before--where a man goes astray from his long-suffering wife to embark on an affair with a younger woman--while the soundtrack washes all of the soap-opera elements with a full dose of symphonic music. Here, at least, the story is told in a simple and brief style, the production itself is a handsome one, and although the performances are competent enough only one performer really stands out as "the new star"--and that, of course, is INGRID BERGMAN making her film debut under David O. Selznick's careful grooming and tutoring.LESLIE HOWARD makes no particular impression as the concert violinist who falls under her spell, except that he really does appear to be playing the instrument, helped no doubt by whatever technical tricks were necessary to give this illusion. Edna Best does nicely as his understanding wife and all of the supporting roles are played in a competent manner.But except for this being a star vehicle to present Bergman to American audiences, there is nothing special about INTERMEZZO. It's worth watching only to see Bergman in her debut and at her most radiant. Mercifully, it has a short running time and might have become really tedious if the story were given more footage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Like a Viennese waltz - smiling but melancholy"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>These are Leslie Howard's words to Bergman on the first night they have a drink together. It was his description of her. I think it is also an apt description for my opinion of this movie. I was expecting to like this more than I did. I am a sucker for a love story, but this one just didn't move me.First, I find Leslie Howard rather lacking as a leading man. He is too much the disillusioned dreamer in almost every role I remember him being in. After a while, it just seems redundant. I think he tends to act overly melodramatic in places too. But I do think his violin playing looked very believable (even though it was dubbed). To sum up my opinion of Howard, using his own words from this film, "Not at all a fetching fellow." Howard is 46 years old here, compared to Bergman's 24 years - but somehow he pulls it off as he still has a youthful face.Bergman, on the other hand, is remarkable in her American screen debut. At her young age, she is in my opinion already a seasoned performer. I think it just came so naturally for her. Also, its amazing that she was filmed without makeup, per Selznick's orders as he wanted to achieve the same fresh faced look she had in her Swedish films. The camera just loves her. The daughter, Anne Marie, played by Ann Todd is so adorable and acts quites naturally. Howard's wife is played by Edna Best, who looks and acts quite bland and comely. Perhaps this is on purpose so as to make the audience be more understanding how he could be unfaithful to his wife.The cinematography is amazing - I especially liked the scene where they try to say goodbye and their reflection is caught in the shop window. I would think that would have been difficult to light.Even though there is an obvious moral failing in the adulterous affair, there are good lessons such as when Halliday's character tells Bergman "I wonder if anyone has built happiness on the unhappiness of others". Bergman finally realizes this and tells Halliday "I have been an intermezzo in his life - we know where he belongs." Also, when Bergman finally leaves and writes a note, it says "Love like ours is wrong. It drags itself down with remorse and fears, and the unhappiness of others." Too bad more people don't heed that advice today. Another touching scene is Howard with his son when he returns back home. The son is bitter, to which Howard responds: "When we're young, we expect the people we love to behave like gods, especially our fathers. But sadly as we grow older, we realize we are all human, tragically human. We all make mistakes - one day maybe you'll understand. And if so, perhaps forgive... even your father."I think there are admirable aspects to the film, especially Bergman's performance and the cinematography. I wouldn't call it a masterpiece, but it is worth a look.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie about the world renowned violinist and his daughters piano teacher is beautiful. Leslie Howard did an amazing job and Ingrid Bergman looked lovely. Although their acting showed no real chemistry between the two... it went along with the story of how she was only an "intermezzo" in his life. I have never seen such a beautiful film about love, affairs, and pain brought to all those involved. It was moving and every bit theatrical as the title presumes. Besides Gone With The Wind it is Howards most lovely film and I suggest to all they see it. Intermezzo was simply... dazzling with its theme and truths. It showed real life in a way that most films of the day were afraid to.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At 70 minutes, the movie doesn't even seem forced at all, it goes by pretty quickly. My main problem with the movie is that there is no chemistry between Leslie Howard and Ingrid Bergman. Since their relationship is the entire movie, it shouldn't work, but somehow i actually liked it in spite of that. At the start, Bergman is giving piano lessons to Leslie's daughter and when he finds out she's really talented herself, they begin to have an affair. Leslie is separated from his wife and he goes on tour with Bergman. His wife wants a divorce and when she is accepted into some music school, she doesn't want to leave him. Leslie Howard does a good job and Ingrid Bergman is gorgeous.</fullReview>

The film stars Leslie Howard, Ingrid Bergman, Ann Todd and Edna Best.This beautiful love story features the Ingrid Bergman in her first English speaking role.Renowned violinist Holgar Brandt(Leslie Howard)returns home from a tour. He is warmly welcomed back by his loving wife Margit(Edna Best)and young daughter Ann Marie(Ann Todd). He meets his daughters piano teacher Anita (Ingrid Bergman)and the two fall in love. As time goes on they begin an affair and Anita leaves her employment with the family and becomes Han's piano accompanist on his tours. Holger soon begins to miss his wife and daughter and comes to realise the pain he is causing them.You feel for Holger and Anita because they genuinely do love one another but they both know their affair is wrong and Anita tries to find the strength to end it, even though it is very painful for her to do so.Ingrid is excellent in her American debut, she conveys her characters feelings so well through her expressions, her eyes especially show so much to the audience. Howard is very good as a rather self centred man, his music is his greatest passion and he falls for Anita partly because she shares his love and talent for music, Holger would be difficult to like if it were not for his love of his daughter, it's obvious he cares for her and that is a redeeming quality.Edna Best is very good as the long suffering wife, confused as to why her husband seems to have stopped loving her and who finds herself unable to forget him or hate him even when he has the affair.The film looks beautiful thanks to Gregg Toland's exquisite photography. Classical music lovers will enjoy the soundtrack and both Howard and Bergman are quite convincing in the scenes where they have to play musical instruments.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ingrid seemed to put a lot of concentration into this story. I love how Leslie plays the role so nonchalantly in the beginning, then all that changes when Ingrid's character performs at the birthday party. The story does seem a bit rushed in spots (I notice the original version is fifteen minutes longer). I think we should've had the scene where he tells the wife he's leaving her. The role of the son is very underdeveloped. But the story is great. You're not supposed to root for the main characters if you're a moral person, and the plot threads are all neatly tidied up when he goes back to the wife in the final scenes. But it leaves you wondering what happened to Ingrid's character. She may have provided an intermezzo for him but there's a sequel in here somewhere. I can't think that these two never met up again. The other thing I want to add here is that I tried to keep in mind that Ingrid had done the entire story before in her native Swedish. Imagine being an English-speaking actor and having to redo your entire performance in another country in another language.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Moralist Love Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Intermezzo comes across as another standard dramatic love story. Leslie Howard stars as Holger Brandt, a world renowned violinist who returns home from a long standing tour to reunite with his family and in the process meets Anita, played by Ingrid Bergman in her first American role as his daughter's piano teacher.Nothing much happens up to the build up of Holger and Anita's relationship. Intermezzo at this point solely focuses on the relations between Holger and his family. This is done mostly in a sentimental manner mainly through the use of the character Ann Marie who adores her Father unconditionally causing Intermezzo to become soppy viewing, setting the foundations for melodrama. It is only once Holger and Anita connect that Intermezzo somewhat becomes intriguing. Attracted to her piano playing Holger improvises with her creating an intense atmosphere as the pair play off each other.This starts the catalyst to their doomed romance in which Ingrid Bergman shines in her performance. Her acting acquires the right emotions for a character who is naturally shy and well ? mannered. Throughout she experiences guilt concerning her actions highlighting the moral dilemma their affair is conveyed to be. She struggles to hold her guilty emotions asking Holger in one scene to look in the mirror to see what she sees, two lovers in a hazardous relationship. Eventually Anita leaves Holger for the sake of decency over their happiness but not before having conflicted emotions wherever to stay or go. All done sufficiently by Ingrid Bergman who captured the senses of a naive woman swept and confused by love.The ending of their affair only intensifies the moralist theme of Intermezzo which quickly sinks to melodramatic depths once Holger returns home. After a reunion with his daughter is cut drastically short by a motor incident he is forced to reflect upon his affair and the consequences it has caused to those around him. Opening up Howard states that "we're tragically human, right up to the rest of our lives", this along with grasping the chance to be a dedicated father from then on brings the moralist theme to full circle.At the length of only 70 minutes Intermezzo may have been improved with a longer run time to expand therefore fleshing out the characters to a greater degree in order to make a more rounded story rather than having characters such as Holger's family members who seem to be nothing more than props to draw guilt onto Holger. However Intermezzo does have its peak in the form of Ingrid Bergman, whose performance here indicates the talent and versatility she showed in her later roles which made her a cinema icon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brief music-themed romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a nice little film about Holger (Leslie Howard), a married concert violinist who falls in love with Anita, his daughter's young piano teacher (Ingrid Bergman, in her US debut).The two go on tour together and true to the old lyric: "music leads the way to romance", the two musicians begin an affair. But can they ignore their duties to family and career? The film is a re-make of the Swedish film 'Intermezzo' (which also starred Bergman) and it retains the Swedish names. As none of the cast are Swedish except Bergman, they might as well have changed the names and location to suit a British setting as the film isn't shot in Sweden anyway.The film is very short- only 70 minutes long- and so even if it wasn't your cup of tea, you could still give it a go. It's an entertaining old-fashioned melodrama. It would have been nice if the characters could be fleshed out slightly more, but Intermezzo is a thoughtful study of adultery. If you liked Brief Encounter, this is worth a shot too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good quick love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A world famous violinist Holgar Brandt (Leslie Howard) falls in love with his child's piano teacher, Anita Hoffman (Ingrid Bergman). The problem is he's married with two children. When he asks Anita to join him on a world tour things start to unravel.Bergman's first English language film (she had done previous ones in Denmark). It's not a deep meaningful film (the story is very familiar) but it is a well-done and very moving love story. Also the movie is only 70 minutes long--it never wears out its welcome and moves along quickly and easily. The acting is all good but Bergman and Howard especially are superb in their roles. They bring their characters to life and make their romance look believable. It does get a little overdone at the end but it still works. A quick, moving romance and Bergman's first American film. What more could you ask for? I give it an 8.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strange Interlude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1939 Leslie Howard made a meal out of noble suffering and he did it equally well when the budget was a stick of gum as here or when it ran into the young millions as in Gone With The Wind. This is a movie you Want to like not least because it marked the English-speaking debut of Ingrid Bergman who was just as gorgeous at 24 as she remained until her death - trivia buffs may like to know that she played a classical pianist both in this, her first English-speaking film and Autumn Sonata her last film on the big screen which was, of course, shot in Swedish, her native language. With only seventy minutes to play with Gregory Ratoff is prodigal with time; the film opens with violin maestro Howard playing a farewell gig at Carnegie Hall; he then TELLS his audience that he is returning home to Sweden; he is then SHOWN on board ship to Sweden in a scene that adds little to the story and then he Arrives in Sweden. Today, in fact for the last forty years or so, a director would cut from Carnegie Hall directly to Howard at home in Sweden but that's really a minor beef. What we have here is our old friend the 'woman's picture' or 'weepie' and it's strangely disjointed; Ratoff at times seems to be anticipating the New Wave in his abrupt cuts. It's ironic that Bergman made her to all intents and purposes film debut as an adulteress who would play the part for real a decade later when she co-starred with Roberto Rossellini in Life Imitating Art. Perhaps in an effort to sugar the pill the adulterers are depicted as cultured, cultivated people, classical musicians in fact as if that somehow lessens the pain of those left behind and almost adding insult to injury they throw in a scene where Howard's young daughter (Ann E Todd) is so happy to see him when he makes a fleeting visit home that she dashes in front of a car and is badly injured. But relax, folks, this is 1939; we don't do infant mortality and lo and behold if in the final scene long-suffering and saintly wife Edna Best takes him back into the fold no questions asked. A few years ago 20th Century Fox reissued some of their classic films (Laura comes to mind) in truncated versions, a gimmick that failed to catch on and Intermezzo is reminiscent of one of these, its actual seventy minutes feeling more like forty and investing it with an air of Adultery-lite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Play It Again and Again Ms. Bergman....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gregg Tolland, Cinematographer, did win the 1940 Oscar, for Wuthering Heights, but he was also nominated for Intermezzo: A Love Story, in the same ceremony that same year. Having replaced Harry Stradling Sr., who passed away in 1970, and whose final three movies were with Barbra Streisand on Funny Girl, Hello Dolly, On a Clear Day You Can See Forever and The Owl and the Pussycat. He goes uncreated on the Black and White 1939 movie of Intermezzo: A Love Story.This is a piece of Cinematographers heaven, with the sheer beauty of light and shade that fill you with awe and astonishment, the atmospheric moods that highlight the drama that enlighten before us. This is visual storytelling at its brightest and never a dull moment.Gregory Ratoff, Russian born in 1897 and who died in 1960, was in his life, an actor, and at other times, director, with director credits going to him for Intermezzo: A Love Story. He has the honour of directing the very beautiful Ingrid Bergman in her first Hollywood role. With her reprise of the same role from the 1936 movie: Intermezzo, this is her first English-speaking role too, (using also, the original screenplay writers of the 1936 movie). As this movie, minus front and rear credits, is only one hour and five minutes long, it would seem that such an recognisable plot would benefit both Studio Bosses and actress alike, no doubt, as an introduction to the English speaking masses.Ms. Bergman's acting comes across as sincere and with her talent and beauty holds no bounds, she is amazing, her perfection and delivery are second to none. She perpetuates her skills with grace and professionalism that any would aspire too. Whilst on the other hand, Leslie Howard plays the decorous stick in the mud, with his simplistic role of the very upper middle class, and with his values and etiquette's that are so now dated, in the movies that is. He tries too hard to please, to come over as the archetypal highbrow and well-heeled good friend to everyone, except his own family. His greed for the other Love, in the end, breaks up this very happy, well-to-do, high society life. This can't be a bad thing by any means, for then we would not see the wonderful and charming acting ability of the young seven year old Ann Todd, who plays the victimised daughter caught between the heartbreak of the betrayed Mother and her cheating Father. Ann Todd is young, but her performance is extraordinary, next to any Hollywood actor of the time, they too would find it hard not to be out classed by Ms. Todd."Oh my God! Did I just see "that" or was I dreaming?" There is a very brief moment in Intermezzo: A Love Story which happens with Ms. Bergman, while she is in a shot all off her own, while looking down at her Lover, it took me by surprise and was, in a way, quite shocking and breath taking, you'll know what I mean after you have seen it. Very inventive and unexpected. Overall, Intermezzo: A Love Story is a beautifully shot movie that conveys the struggle of Marriage and how to keep the Family values together, while in the face of temptation. To convey the message that the grass may be a little greener on the other side, but only for a short while, and that Love, in the end, really does Conquer All.One hour and five minutes of Hollywood bliss. Lose yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stinker of a movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Standard, typical tear-jerker - highly-renowned concerto artist deserts family to take off with his child's piano teacher. They cavort around Europe until she finally throws him out and resumes her music career.The ladies in the audience use up three handkerchiefs apiece with their weeping. The men wonder at the idiot male who gives up the luscious Bergman to return to sleep with his wife who is stupid enough to take him back.The plot is straight out of East Lynne and told dozens of times on stage and in screen. Two star-crossed lovers finally come to their senses when they are reminded about the lives they are ruining with their carrying-ons. So they cry on each others shoulders and go their separate ways. A stinker of a movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated and stilted</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I actually bought this movie to complete my Leslie Howard collection as he is one of my all-time favourite actors ( he excels in the Scarlet Pimpernel and Of Human Bondage). However, he seems to exude a melodramaticism in this movie, he never appears to be comfortable in the role and uses a lot of wide-eyed reaction shots to get some point across that only he is privy to. Ingrid is wonderful as always and steals the movie with her freshness and innocence. Ann Todd is also a delight but even in his scenes with her, Leslie is "hammy" and awkward. A classic 30's movie where the moral outcome is never in doubt and honesty &amp; duty triumphs over undying love. On my 10 scale I would only give it a 3 of out 10 for script/plot, an 8 for music, 9 for cinematography and on overall 5 for the acting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Piece of melodrama provided with suitable duration</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Intermezzo" is a duly old-fashioned, if a bit clumsy piece of melodrama. It's a remake of the same name Swedish film made three years earlier, in which Ingrid Bergman played the same role. Her glowing on the screen is the main reason that makes "Intermezzo" worthwhile. Fortunately the film is only 70 minutes long. In this case, more would have been hard to sit through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Was that the great Leslie Howard?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Leslie Howard who has been brilliant in nearly al his films (esp The Petrified Forest, Of Human Bondage, Pygmallion, Teh Scarlette Pimprenel and of course GWTW) realy gave a stiff, false performance in this 1939 movie that he himself co-produced with David o' Selznick of the Gone With The Wind (1939) -- I'm thinking that both their creative juices were at a major low --- this movie was so insincere and contrived and lacks any universal appeal that makes movies "classics". Sterotypes Galore -- and poor, souless dialogue for a supposed deep romance/drama -- poor Ingrid Bergman -- she doesn't have much to work with -- but thank god she stuck around -- bc this swedish beauty could not only act -- she could steal your heart! Anastasia and For Whom The Bell Tolls are proof of what a great range she had! So don't judge Selznick, Howard or Bergman by this piece of crap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What is a friend for?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoilers HereinI loved this movie, although it was sad. The only problem I had with it was that Stenborg, I thought, tried to break the couple up. He convinced her to go to Paris to accept the award, and then tries to persuade him to go home and start over. Isn't he supposed to be a good friend? When someone falls in love when they're married, it ruins the marriage and cannot be started over, IMHO. Anyways, if he didn't come back Ann Marie would have never had the run in with the car, and the whole family still doesn't like him as much after Anita. Me, being old-fashioned, would like a happy ending but oh well. Very good, dramatic movie anyways.</fullReview>
