		<shortDescription>Getting philosophical about death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted by Walter Ferris, Maxwell Anderson and Gladys Lehman from Alberto Cassella's 1929 play La Morte in Vacanze, Death Takes a Holiday features Fredric March as the titular Grim Reaper. Death becomes curious about why he is so feared. He wants to understand humankind better. So through some unspecified means he becomes corporeal for a three-day period, beginning and ending at midnight. He chooses to take the form of a Prince Sirki, recently deceased, and takes his holiday at the palatial Italian villa of Duke Lambert (Guy Standing). Will he discover what makes humans tick in only three days? This is a highly successful, unusual film. It has strong touches of horror, even though it's more of an art-house drama cum romance flick. It's also frequently philosophical, and director Mitchell Leisen easily sustains dramatic tension for close to 90-minutes despite the fact that this was only his second feature, and a very "talky" one at that, which takes place primarily in a single setting (the play only had one set, but the film adds a couple other scenes).Of course March's performance is crucial to making the film work. He has the difficult task of playing both a personification of a menacing supernatural force and a chimerical human trying to "act natural" and slightly failing. That March plays the role so impeccably is made all the more fascinating in light of the fact that he was filming All of Me (1934) at the same time. He borrowed a woman's bicycle (his wife Florence Elridge's) to enable him to quickly travel from one set to the other on the Paramount studio lot. March has said that Death/Prince Sirki was one of his favorite roles, and he willingly reprised it both on radio for Lux Radio Theater in March of 1937 and on stage, in a production by Baltimore City College in May of 1938.As impressive as March is, he is initially upstaged by the fantastic special effects. We first see Death as simply a shadow. Later, March appears in more traditional Grim Reaper garb, which is eerily transparent and surprisingly modern in design. Leisen demanded that the transparency effect be achieved in-camera rather than a later manipulation during the film processing stage. So Gordon Jennings employed the same technique that made The Invisible Man (1933) invisible. Parts of the set were recreated in black velvet. These were reflected in a partially transparent mirror, which was then superimposed over March (you can see a related effect "live" in the ballroom scene of Walt Disney World's The Haunted Mansion ride). March's elaborate cloaks were composed of layers of chiffon in dark hues from gray to black. Jennings also installed tiny lights under March's "hood" to light up his skull make-up.The rest of the cast is excellent, too, if maybe a bit too sprawling for the film's length. But there needs to be a larger number of characters, as a hinge of the film is that three different women fall in love with Prince Sirki during his brief visit, one of them eventually being discouraged by his bizarre behavior, the other by being able to see his "true self". Sirki ends up falling in love with Grazia (Evelyn Venable, in her second role after 1933's Cradle Song), who is supposedly the fiancée of Corrado (Kent Taylor), but with him, she is oddly aloof. Despite the romance between Death/Sirki and Grazia, March and Venable never kiss in the film, as Venable's father had a clause written into her contract forbidding it.Leisen creates a thick, almost creepy atmosphere for much of the film (although it's strongest when Duke Lambert first encounters Death), which gives it much of its horror overtones. For me, the romance aspect has a slight (appropriate) morbidity because of this, and it's questionable whether the film should even be considered a romance. The set design is also fantastic--the villa is breathtaking; it's too bad Leisen couldn't show it off more.The constant tension invoked by Death/Sirki always being on the brink of "blowing his cover" keeps the viewer on the edge of their seat more often than one might expect. But Death Takes a Holiday is most fascinating when it waxes philosophical. Because death is on holiday, numerous accidents occur that people just walk away from (this was an intriguing and logical aspect that was absent from the 1998 remake, Meet Joe Black). This makes the newspapers, and Death finds it particularly ironic that humans seem to almost lament that war is not working correctly. He promises to the unwitting that humankind will soon again be able to blow each other up. Baron Cesarea (Henry Travers, who also played Dr. Cranley in The Invisible Man) offers that there are three "games" in life--money, war and love, and Death/Sirki ends up agreeing. Love finally gives him the answer of why humankind fears him so, and finally shows why life is not futile or simply a frittering away of time while people wait for him to arrive in his natural guise. The ending of the film was quite controversial, and suggests that love can even surmount death; it almost seems to say that possessing love, death might not be such a bad thing after all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and Romantic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have watched this movie many times over the years and I continue to love it, even more than the remake `Meet Joe Black' with Brad Pitt and Anthony Hopkins (On it's own a great movie with wonderful actors).However, In this original movie, `Death Takes A Holiday' the title role is played by the incredibly talented Fredric March, as he portrays an intensely charismatic Death/Prince Sirki. Here you will find an innocent, charming stranger who is learning from his host and the guests surrounding him yet is also imparting his own knowledge and wisdom.The path Death has taken is a journey in which all of us partake. What makes us human? What brings us joy and happiness in this lifetime? All that Death has ever seen of our world is fear as he greets those who enter his world. So, he enters our world to see and feel what more there is to our existence. In fact, we could learn a great deal from the character Death, for he reminds us of that which we take for granted in this life, and is denied to him as Death.`Death Takes A Holiday' may seem dark and forbidding but it is filled with hope that is encouraging; and love which should follow us past this life and into the next.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Holiday Affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Adapted from a play by Alberto Casella, Death Takes a Holiday is a more charming film that one might imagine. Death, using the name Prince Sirki, comes to earth in human form to learn a thing or two about life and human nature. He gets more than he bargained for. This is one of the first directorial jobs Mitchell Leisen had at Paramount, and he makes the most of it. He manages to make the film at various moments gloomy and romantic, lighthearted and very serious. At no time is the movie depressing, and the ending surprisingly uplifting.Fredric March makes a handsome, almost soulful Prince Sirki, and delivers a fine performance. I only wish that he had used the same restraint in his later, flashier character-acting roles. Offering strong support are Evelyn Venable, Guy Standing and Henry Travers (later to play an angel of mercy in It's a Wonderful Life). There's a lot of good luck on the side of this film. Paramount was the right studio to make it. They tended to bring a light touch to nearly everything they did in those days, and it is most appreciated here. I highly recommend this movie to pessimistic know-it-alls who think they have everything figured out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very worth seeing, but frustrating</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First of all, the director of this film, Mitchell Leisen is one of the most underrated talents of 30's and 40's. He's acquired something of a bad reputation because of pretty vicious remarks made about him by Preston Sturges and Billy Wilder when talking about the films he directed from their scripts in the days before they were allowed to direct their *own* scripts. However, he doesn't deserve the derision. He's made some fluff films, for sure, but he's a consistently entertaining filmmaker who, more often than not, really delivers.Anyway, Death Takes a Holiday is sort of his "art film" and it has a lot of great things in it. Fredric March's performance as Death is wonderful, the atmosphere is thick, the humor works, the scene setting is smart and romantic, and the opening titles are fun and weird, immediately presenting the film as something that's going to be a little unusual.The problem with the film lies in Fredric March's romance with Evelyn Venable. The idea of Death falling in love with a human is great, but it's just not convincing here, mostly due to Venabale turning in a wooden performance that almost suggests she might be hypnotized. Also, the dialogue between them, particularly in the closing scene, is melodramatic and pseudo poetic beyond belief. You almost want to laugh at it.It's a shame this most important aspect of the movie was handled so badly because just about everything else in film is great, particularly the interaction between Fredric March and just about everyone else in film who isn't Evelyn Venable. All of the good stuff just bursts with intruiging ideas.And for that I would recommend the film to all potential viewers. The film is not without it's problems, but the good stuff is just good enough for me to say that the proverbial glass is definitely half full.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film as a teenager and became an immediate Fredric March fan. I can't even imagine someone like Brad Pitt playing this haunting, romantic character. If you want to own this movie on DVD, though, the two-disc set of Meet Joe Black does contain a beautiful transfer of the original 1934 classic on the second disc in the set.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Why Fear Death...?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is a subject that might be brought into the sphere of a masters degree thesis: how the destruction and death of World War I created a wave of theatrical and cinematic creativity dealing with life after death, and that death is not an ending but a beginning. This trend mirrored the rise of spiritualism (as pushed and advocated by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Sir Oliver Lodge, and others) as a way of healing the real emotional losses felt by millions of people around the world after 1914 - 1918. It produced some works of stage and screen such as the anti-war FIFTY MILLION GHOSTS (attacking armaments king Basil Zaharoff - young Orson Welles appeared on stage in it), the play and film OUTWARD BOUND by Sutton Vane, and (probably best of all) Albert Casella's classic DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY. It's still produced occasionally, and even made it to a television version (in 1971) and a recent remake (MEET JOE BLACK).Supposedly, as the "Lusitania" was going to the bottom of the Irish Sea, producer Charles Frohman said to his friends standing with him on deck, "Why fear death? It is the most beautiful adventure in life?" or words to that effect. Frohman (who did drown in the disaster) was quoting the words of his close friend and business associate James Barrie from PETER PAN. In a sense, Casella's story follows this particular point of view. Death (Fredric March) has come to the palazzo of Duke Lambert (Sir Guy Standing) and is intent on taking his daughter Grazia (Evelyn Venable), but instead makes a deal. He has heard a great deal about the human emotion of love, and has never experienced it. Instead, the only experience with human beings he has had was fear. So, he will not take any of Lambert's guests, family, or friends on this visit, if Lambert will allow him to stay as "Prince Sirki", a recently deceased nobleman whose form is available. Lambert agrees.The film actually (like the play) is quite probing, into the nature of death, love, and life itself. We see the various people who are in the palazzo, some of whom have lives of pleasure or adventure, and March constantly finds small flaws in these things that the humans overlook. When he meets one who races at high speed, he asks (straightforwardly, but with a heavy ironic undertone), "Why haven't we met before?" Henry Travers in a supporting role is a lover of fine food and drink - and obviously he too may soon meet March again under different circumstances.But it is Venable who is the key to March's humanization. She is not impressed by the wonders of life and the world her friends push. She seeks something more meaningful. A beautiful woman, she is pursued in the film (by Carrado - Kent Taylor), but finds his heavy sensual love not what she wants. It is only with March, also seeking an answer, that she finds the match to herself.March too is pursued, by the social climbing Gail Patrick and Helen Westley, and both are quickly shown the valuelessness of "titles" and status. March willingly shows them (briefly) his real self, and they flee him in terror. Both March and Veneble are incomplete: he by the seeming void in his eternal duty of ending life and being feared for it, she by her realizing what the book of ECCLESIASTES said two thousand years ago that is still true: "Vanity of Vanities...all is vanity!". The one exception is true love, and both find that in each other that goal is met. So at the end Grazia willingly goes with Sirki, because there is no fear for both when together - for together they can face the universe and eternity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Little Dance With Death</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on an Italian play that performed on Broadway in 1929, the 1934 DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY would be the inspiration for the 1998 Brad Pitt film MEET JOE BLACK--but whereas MEET JOE BLACK proved a highly literal interpretation of the theme, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY is unexpectedly lyric in tone.The story is a fantasy. Death has grown weary of the fear he inspires in human beings, and in an effort to understand the tenacity to which they cling to life he decides to take a three day "holiday." He accordingly presents himself at the house of an Italian nobleman as "Prince Sirki," and soon discovers that human beings pass their lives in games, none of them of any great importance or interest. But there is one "game" he has yet to play: love.Like many films of the early 1930s, the script is a bit talky and the cinematography a bit static; with the exception of Evelyn Venable (as Grazia) and Henry Travers (as Baron Cesarea) the cast, including the usually subtle Frederic March, tend to play in a somewhat theatrical manner. Even so, the overall tone of the film is unexpectedly touching, lyrical, and strangely lovely. It is also, on occasion, gently humorous. And before Death resumes his true identity and returns to the business of mortality, we receive unexpected food for thought.The film is not widely available on either DVD or VHS, nor is it frequently televised. That is unfortunate, for fans of 1930s cinema will find it darkly charming. Worth seeking out!Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Grim Reaper vacations in Italy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Death Takes a Holiday" was based on a play, and it's interesting that another playwright was called upon to adapt it for the screen. The original piece by Alberto Casella feels almost Pirandellian, in that it elevates every day things into a philosophical realm. Maxwell Anderson's respect for the original text shows in his elegant treatment of the material. The film is greatly enhanced by Mitchell Leisen's direction.The people behind this 1934 film gathered an interesting cast to play Mr. Casella's characters. The idea of making death a human being was a novel idea. When the Grim Reaper becomes real in the person of Prince Sirki, it opened the possibilities for how he looked at life from this new perspective.The idea of bringing Prince Sirki into the Duke Lambert's palatial home was the right setting, for it gives the movie an elegance that only in that context could be achieved. It's clear that Prince Sirki falls for the beautiful Grazia instantly. Grazia is almost engaged to Corrado, the Duke's son.It's a joy to see these aristocrats at play when they encounter the figure of the prince. Only the Duke knows about him and is always by the prince's side in order to help him grasp the earthly nuances that supposedly, Sirki knows nothing about.The ensemble performances Mr. Leisen achieved from his cast shows on the finished product we see. Fredric March makes an elegant presence as Sirki. The beautiful Evelyn Venable is perfect as Grazia. Guy Standing makes the most of his Duke Lambert. Henry Travers, Kent Taylor, Gail Patrick and Katherine Alexancer are seen in minor parts.How can anyone compare this elegant production with the recent remake of this film? It is a puzzle to this observer, at best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Takes A Holiday (1934) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite some stilted dialogue and acting, this is an exquisitely opulent fantasy about the meaning of life which seamlessly mixes elements of comedy, romance and horror and emerges as an unjustly neglected minor classic - so much so that dear old Universal has deemed it fit to only give it a DVD release by proxy, unceremoniously slapping it onto their "Ultimate Edition" DVD of its overblown and unnecessary remake, MEET JOE BLACK (1998). Fredric March is superb in the lead and only confirms his position as one of Hollywood's finest, most versatile and consistent character actors (despite being blessed with matinée idol looks); March himself considers this to be one of his favorite roles. This was only Mitchell Leisen's second film as director, and his production designer past is still much in evidence, but he would go on to make several accomplished films - particularly EASY LIVING (1937), MIDNIGHT (1939), ARISE, MY LOVE (1940) and KITTY (1945) - before his career gradually petered out in the late 40s. A strikingly similar film to DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY which I also would love to watch is Harold S. Bucquet's ON BORROWED TIME (1939) with Sir Cedric Hardwicke playing Death and Lionel Barrymore as his unwilling "client" - but it never seems to get shown on TV in my neck of the woods!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An uneasy blend of fantasy, romance and sophistication</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many contemporary viewers will find the dialogue here hard going, for the film shows its stage origins; the heightened rhetoric and often extended speeches that have the characters speaking at, rather than to one another, create a rather wooden effect on the screen. This film could not have come from any studio other than Paramount during the 1930s: the only studio that produced what might be called today art films, including this one. From Mae West, W.C. Fields and the Marx Brothers; to the Lubitsch musicals with Maurice Chevalier and Jeanette Macdonald and his European-like sophisticated romantic comedies; to an occasional deMille spectacular; Paramount provided the most diversified output of the early studio era. Yet,with the exception of the occasional action costume drama, most Paramount films seem to have been made on a relatively low budget, with only one or two sets, including this film. However, since set design was always done with some elegance, economy is not as noticeable as with the Warner films. (Where a devotee has seen the same apartment set so often that s/he feels right at home).I notice that most IMDB reviewers give positive comments. Perhaps I was just not ready for this one last night (I recall having enjoyed it more years ago); but for me the components never jelled so as to provide a consistent development of plot or characterizations.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite its melodramatic and dated elements, this is a fascinating film?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Under the atmospheric direction of Paramount Pictures contract director Mitchell Leisen (who also directed Olivia de Havilland in an Oscar-winning performance in 1946's TO EACH HIS OWN), DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY remains one of most unusual and unique films to come out of 1930s Hollywood. Although the film is quite dated due to its stage origins and the dialogue in Maxwell Anderson's adapted screenplay is quite melodramatic, the story of Death adopting a human form for three days and eventually falling in love with a mortal female is an intriguing one. Plus, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY clocks around at a brief 79 minutes and does not suffer the tedious three-hour length of its loose remake, MEET JOE BLACK (1998).The cast is excellent. Although Fredric March hams it up sometimes as Death/Prince Sirki, he's a far more interesting presence than the bland Brad Pitt in the remake. One can feel Death's sense of despair and longing to explore the world of mortals in his first scene, whereas Brad Pitt displayed almost none of these qualities in his lifeless performance (pun intended). Evelyn Venable, who later provided the gentle voice of the Blue Fairy in Walt Disney's PINOCCHIO (1940), is a lovely love interest in this film. And Henry Travers, who played the angelic Clarence in IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE (1946), is delightful as an old baron who believes that love, money, and war are the three things that make life meaningful.The production values are lavish and film's atmosphere is eerie, strange, and deeply romantic. Even the opening credits are clever! The black-and-white cinematography is excellent under the hands of Charles Lang, who also provided the atmospheric cinematography for such fantasy films as PETER IBBETSON (1935), THE UNINVITED (1944), and THE GHOST AND MRS. MUIR (1947). I especially liked the scene in which Death, partly transparent and completely shrouded in a black veil, visits Duke Lambert (Guy Standing) in the middle of a foggy night with a choir vocalizing over the soundtrack.What's even better about DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY is that Death really does take a holiday?throughout his three-day holiday there are worldwide reports of accidents and incidents in which the victims mysteriously survive unhurt. This element is absent in the remake and this film also contains the humor that the remake lacked. The film's conclusion, which was highly controversial at the time, had me think a little differently about death despite its melodramatic delivery.Although this fascinating little film is nowhere near as famous as its lavish but bland remake, DEATH TAKES A HOLIDAY is well worth watching if you can tolerate the dated and melodramatic 1930s dialogue and acting styles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I see that many comments about this film mention the Brad Pitt version but not the made-for-TV 1971 film that had the same title as this one.It was good at the time but never came close to this jewel.That version really dealt with the fact that no one was dying and how all over the world no matter the catastrophe the sick,hurt,and injured lived on.For6 months I talked about getting a copy of 1934 movie off amazon.com with prices between $45-$130 all used.Passed but to my good luck I read a "Meet Joe Black" review and found out this movie was on the 2nd disc in the Ultimate Edition version.Best $11 I ever spent to see a classic 30's film.Fredrich March was wonderful and all the supporting players reminded me of the horror films classics of 30-40's that also had standout cast. I just love them.Since I'm not a Brad Pitt fan I probably won't watch his film-no offense but the super nova A-list actors just don't make me believe their character.All I see is Brad Pitt,Tom Cruise,George Clooney not the roles but that's just me -and yes I didn't see the Ocean films for that reason.I love this film!10 stars and if you like black &amp; white classics like this watch Dodsworth,State of the Union &amp; the earlier versions of Backstreet,Imitaion of Life and The Front Page.Funny thing is a movie from 1939 "On Borrowed Time" with Lionel Barrymore had a similar theme of Death walking the earth to collect someone but I didn't care for it. Funniest recent take on Death visiting is the "Family Guy" animated series.The shows with Death alone are worth the cost of the DVD collection.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Meet Death at an Italian villa.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Duke Lambert vacations with his family and friends in an Italian villa, when that night he receives the most unwelcome visitor of all, Death. Death, however, is not making his usual visit but seeking to take a holiday in the guise of a mortal to find out people's perceptions and fears on death and its relationship to life. Disguising himself as Prince Siriki (who Death made his customary visit to) he mingles among Lambert's family and friends, but strikes the most sincere relationship with Grazia, a young lady who is the daughter of a princess and the fiancé of Lambert's son Corrado. Grazia leaves the villa for a short time and in the meanwhile, Death takes in the fun that mortals do (especially these financially well-off mortals), but can't seem to find the answers to what he is searching for. When Corrado and the others learn from Lambert who the prince really is, they plan to get him as far away from the villa as possible, but that may endanger the life of Grazia, who has recently returned. A very intense film that blends the elements of philosophy, romance, drama, and dark humor. March, a comic actor in his early career, plays his role extremely well by taking the role seriously (which the rest of the cast was able to do admirably) while injecting the feeling and curiosity expected of him. Venable seemed a bit wooden, but I'm not sure if that was really her or her character. The ending seems to be acted on top of a soapbox, but the final scenes are masterfully done. Rating, 8.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Long before the atrocious "Meet Joe Black" came the classic story of love, romance and death. Suave Fredrick March portrays Prince Sirki, an Aristocrat whose identity Death has chosen so that he might better understand the fear that all people seem to have of him. For three days he stays at the villa of a minor aristocrat, during which time no one in the world dies. Evelyn Venable is the girl filled with melancholy who falls in love with him, and unknown to all the others has seen him for who he really is all along (Venable was a popular actress of her day but is best known as the Columbia Lady with the Torch symbol)A sophisticated play of manners as well as a touching and sensitive love story this one will last through the ages.

		<shortDescription>The emotions are very real</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If Death took a holiday, the guns would go silent in Iraq, the slaughter on our nation's highways would cease, and the news media would be compelled to cover positive events in the humanities, arts, and sciences. Unfortunately, Death has not had a vacation in recorded history, but Mitchell Leisen's 1934 fantasy, Death Takes a Holiday, allows us to consider the possibility. Co-written by Maxwell Anderson and Gladys Lehman and based on the play "La Morte in Vacanza" by Alberto Casella, Death Takes a Holiday stars Frederic March as the Grim Reaper who takes on human form in an attempt to discover why men fear him so much. Why he has waited 5,000 years to satisfy this curiosity is not explained.After a brief tryout as a shadowy figure who scares the daylights out of those that cross his path, Death shows up at, of all places, an upscale party at an Italian villa, posing as the mysterious Prince Sirki. Only one person knows who he really is, the host Duke Lambert (Guy Standing), and he is sworn to secrecy. Sirki proceeds to fascinate the guests. Given to bursts of wit and poetry, he can just as quickly turn sullen and threatening, and some soon find out that it is better not to look too deeply into his eyes. During the three days in which the Prince is at the villa, however, people all over the world miraculously escape death and potential suicides are doomed to frustration.To see what's behind all the conversation about love, the suave but naive Prince Sirki falls for the irresistible Grazia (Evelyn Venable), the daughter of one of Duke's friends. Grazia knows who Death is but does not fear him, much to the chagrin of her fiancé, Corrado (Kent Taylor) who has developed a strong disdain for Prince Charming. More sinister than Brad Pitt in the 1998 remake Meet Joe Black, March turns in a very convincing performance as the creepy yet strangely appealing guest. Although the ending is melodramatic, the emotions are very real and the suggestion that Death may in reality be a friend disguised as a foe is quite touching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the films that everyone should see in their lifetime.For me, my first viewing was a very personal event. The next day I went to the hospital to see my great-aunt for the last time. Her questions to me were, "What did you do last night?" "I watched an old movie on TV." Then she asked, "What was the movie?" I'll I could say was, "I don't remember." Funny how these little lies just happen and haunt you forever.The old Hollywood knew how to take a play and make it into a real movie. The staging and the effects made Death believable unlike Mr. Black. Though it is obvious in Death that it is a stage play taken to the screen, Mr. Black does an excellent job of using the current technology to make a visually stunning film. Too bad that was not the point.Enjoy them both for what they are, live each day like it might be your last and don't visit your favorite aunt on her death bed after you have seen the original.Peace...</fullReview>

The fantastical elements are handled in a plausible manner, the plot is satisfyingly intelligent, and the overall effect is one which both entertains &amp; informs.Fredric March stars as the troubled Phantom who literally descends upon an Italian houseparty in the guise of a mysterious prince in order to find the answers to the questions which have troubled him for millennia. March is excellent in what almost amounts to a dual role, that of the love-deprived Death and also of the eccentric Prince Sirki, who seems in complete command of his surroundings. Sir Guy Standing, whose own life would soon be cut short by tragedy, is first rate as the old duke who alone knows March's true identity.Death's presence has a distinct effect on three young women staying at the Villa Felicitá: lovely princess Evelyn Venable begins to reconsider her love match with handsome Kent Taylor, while American Gail Patrick &amp; Italian noblewoman Katharine Alexander set their caps for the intriguing new arrival.Three old pros, Helen Westley as the hostess, and Henry Travers &amp; Kathleen Howard as members of the houseparty, all add dignity to their supporting roles.Paramount gave the film lavish production values which entertain the eye throughout. Also, notice the clever way in which the credits identify most of the cast during the opening sequence set in the lively town market.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What If Prince Sirki Decided To Hang Out With Some Working Class Folks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Twenties post World War I saw a great revival in spiritualism of which the play Death Takes A Holiday is most certainly part. It was hard for rational man to fathom the cost of the greatest war yet fought on the planet. People sought answers in things not comprehensible in this world.Death Takes A Holiday occurs in Italy during World War I which had its own front in that war with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Seeing so much of it with the accompanying fear in men's eyes, Death in the guise of the recently departed Prince Sirki takes a three day holiday and spends it at the estate of Guy Standing and several other guests.Maybe one day someone will write a story where death personified spends time with some poor or working class family on the globe somewhere. I'm sure he'd get quite a different perspective on life. Spending a holiday with Guy Standing or with Anthony Hopkins in Meet Joe Black is not the general rule of things.Fredric March as Prince Sirki cuts a romantic and rather lonely figure and is grateful for the company for those three days. One of the guests, Evelyn Venable is a woman with rather strange ideas. What she does in the end is just a wee bit too weird for my taste. Death Takes A Holiday is a romantic drama with spiritual overtones, directed in a lavish style by Mitchell Leisen. It's an interesting, but I think at this point rather dated film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A classic love and death film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has been remade several times but the original is the one to see. Frederic March is outstanding as Prince Sirki (Death) and is at the height of his matinee idol looks. Evelyn Venable is innocent and vulnerable as Grazia who loves Death in both of his forms. There is a bit of "humor" in the film that seems out of place. The acting is surprisingly good for an early film and the supporting players are solid. My favorite scene is when Death takes Grazia into the gazebo at the end of the film and places his cape around her. It is very romantic and is not the usual "cop out" that you might expect. This is an unusual film that is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting twist to the old myth of gods walking among us mortals</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fascinating curio from the 1930s is based on an Italian stage play that posited the simple question: Would Death be intrigued by why we mortals cling so stubbornly to life in spite of our self-evident self-destructive urges. Death, in this movie, is at a disadvantage in this since he is immortal and can never death itself. It posits a question that has been posed as earlier as the ancient Greek playwrights such Euripides: Are the gods inferior to mortals because the former have no knowledge nor capacity for understanding the deep suffering the latter are capable of because mortals are always aware on some level that they will ultimately die? This story, Death Takes a Holiday, is reminiscent of aspects of Christian theology that posited Jesus, as the Son of God, was part of the divine Godhead and thus by allowing Jesus the Crucifixion, God could come to understand the suffering of which His creation was capable. By that understanding, Jesus could redeem the sins of mankind as God, through Jesus, gained an understanding of what it meant to be human. Even though this perspective isn't strictly orthodox, it was best illustrated in another movie, The Green Pastures, which was made in 1936.As to the film itself, the presentation has definitely dated aspects. What keeps the film in the category of a flawed classic rather than a dated curio is Frederick March's wonderful performance as Death who comes as Prince Sirki to a weekend gathering of Italian aristocrats at the villa of one of those aristocrats. March captures ideally the worldliness of an ageless figure, such as death, who has seen everything and his endearing naiveté as Death realizes he's actually experienced nothing of what he sees. It's when he falls in love with the beautiful Grazia that he begins to understand the suffering of which humans are capable. Indeed when Grazia wishes to go with Sirki/Death, Death feels the anguish that a person feels who must part from one he loves. It is when she declares that she knew who he really was all along and isn't afraid to follow him to his realm that Death grasps the power of love in the face of death. March conveys all of this beautifully and even makes his final rather overwrought speech memorable and moving.Unfortunately, from those thespian heights, the other aspects of the film are a rather mixed bag. The young actress who plays Grazia is given overdone dialog that irresistibly reminds me of the lines of the "serious" play that Katherine Hepburn's character in the movie, Backstage, is auditioning for. That's the play with the classic line, much parodied, "Father, the calla lillies are in bloom again..." Grazia's lines approach the laughable. Also, for a group of Italian aristocrats, the guests at the house sport frank American or English accents while the few working class Italians that appear are pure stage Italians out of the Chico Marx mold.But despite these limitations which led me to subtract three stars out of ten, it's a film well worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie made my top ten list. All of the actors gave very good performances. The selection of costumes, wardrobes and jewelry were excellent. The special effects (1934) weren't overwhelming or too far-out. The location setting was reasonable for such a low budget firm. The direction, lighting and audio were first rate. Its a shame that someone hasn't done a re-make of this classic film. With the right cast, director and resources this film could win an Oscar. Perhaps, I'll make an attempt with a short version on video. As far as I started to explain, I felt very please, entertained and taken by every line of this film. It would be a worthwhile purchase for someones personal movie library. If not available for sale. Please set your VCR for it the next time its listed on the Classic-Movie cable channels. You and your friends (if you like real-good movies) wouldn't be disappointed...enjoy, Kenny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Death Takes a Holiday (1934) ***</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Effective fantasy where the fearsome visage of the Grim Reaper is transformed into the human form of Prince Sirki, played by a handsome Fredric March in his prime. As Death, March decides to take a three day vacation from his usual duties and mingle among people to try to learn why they fear dying so much, and to ultimately discover the complexities of falling in love.Nice touches of humor, mixed with the glow of mystery and the unknown. As an added bonus, the movie also has something to say regarding death which may cause you to think differently about that unavoidable day when the Grim Reaper comes knocking on your door. *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice old B&amp;W movie from 1934.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I got the 'Meet Joe Black' DVD from my public library, it had a second disk which contained this movie, 'Death Takes A Holiday.' Since they are both derived from the original stage play, it was enjoyable comparing the two. The basic story is the same, but they are moved forward quite differently and end quite differently. However, this older movie is definitely worth a viewing whether or not you have seen the more recent one.SPOILERS follow, don't read any further or risk severe disappointment. In this 1934 version, 'death' shows up as a very dark but somewhat transparent shadowy figure, tell his 'host' what he wants, and proceeds to then take the body of someone just dead, as yet unknown to his host. He wants to experience life, and does quite a few things. In this version, while death is taking his holiday, people don't die during great tragedies. A ship explodes offshore but all survive. A school of children burns, race cars collide and flip over, race horses fall on their jockeys, and in each case all survive. Death also falls in love with the reluctant young lady, but in this version she is not the daughter of his host, instead the girlfriend of the host's son. In this version, when it is time for death to return to his rightful place, the girl goes with him, sacrificing her life on Earth to be with him. Compared with 'Meet Joe Black' this is a simpler story, and moves along quite quickly, and is only about 80 minutes long.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>the original is better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As is usually the case, the original version of this story is better than the remake. So, why not get a hold of the original instead and see the story at its best.Frederick March is an unusually handsome version of the Angel of Death. Inexplicably, he decides to STOP killing people temporarily so he can live as a mortal and see what life is like for them. Unfortunately, he falls in love in the process AND the world soon discovers that having NO ONE die isn't necessarily a good thing--those who would normally die are forced to live in pain and misery until March decides to return to his former self.See it--it's well worth the trouble looking for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fredric March &amp; Evelyn Venable are a Big Bravo</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always enjoyed the great acting of Fredric March, who won two Academy Awards for "Dr. Jekyll &amp; Mr. Hyde",'31 and also "The Best Years of Our Lives",'46. In this picture, March plays a rather strange role as Prince Sirki, who is permitted to be a house guest of a rich family and is found to be quite strange in his manners. Some rather attractive young ladies sort out to flirt with the Prince and all of a Sudan decided to run away immediately. However, Evelyn Venable,(Grazia),"The Little Colonel",'35, seems to capture his heart and soul, which he did not seem to know that he possessed. The ending of the picture will surprise you and make you wonder if the correct decisions were made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best fantasy films of all time, and ignore the remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is the biggest "spoiler" this review is going to offer: ignore the remake. Yes, I know the remake has Brad Pitt and Sir Tony Hopkins and about (it seems) a 6-hour run time - yawn - whereas this poor original, in contrast, "only" has Frederick March and about an 80 minute run time and special effects from the 1930s. Seems no contest? It is. Ignore the modern version, it is junk. See this, the original, based very closely on the original stage play, with March giving one of the best performances of this career (by the 1950s, some 20 years later, this great actor, with a mesmerizing physical presence, was reduced to B movies. Same thing happened to Rita Hayworth). The story is a one-of and as far as this reviewer is concerned, un-equalled even today. Death gets bored, wants to experience physical life, wants to experience love. Takes the form of a visiting prince at a gathering of upper class wealthy types (in films and plays of that era, the upper class were always visiting each other or partying or philosophizing). After warning his host not to reveal his true identity, Death in human form tries to mingle. And that's all the spoiler you get. Astonishing writing, deft dialogue, an odd mixture of horror story, love story, and suspense story. I would without hesitation call this one of the best 100 films of all time, and my reviews here show that I have seen my share to judge from.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Death Takes a Holiday (1934) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Death (Fredric March), curious to know why people fear him, takes on human form for a three day vacation. Things get a bit complicated when he falls in love with a woman who also loves him. This is a wonderful little film that mixes comedy, drama and various horror elements to a great effect. March is wonderful as usual and blends the perfect amount of caring and horror. His performance here is so much better than in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde. The actual horror elements of Death are among the best ever from this period.Sadly, Universal has only issued this film on its remake DVD as an extra nnd now that is out of print. Hopefully this film will get the respect it's due.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Searching for a pure soul that doesn't fear him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Forget about the green mist of "The Ten Commandments" skipping doors with blood painted on them, or the cloaked skeleton pointing his dinner at a bunch of people who ate the Salmon Moose in "Monty Python's The Meaning of Life", or even the comical figure on "Family Guy". This view of the angel of death is profound, almost romantic, with sincerity and integrity. "Has it ever occurred to you that death may be more simpler than life?", Death (Fredric March) asks. I certainly hope so!Appearing to Sir Guy Standing as an unfaced dark mist, he tells him (in March's voice) that he will be soon joining them in the guise of the Russian nobleman scheduled to visit them that "won't be there himself". All but Standing believe him to be this member of the Russian aristocracy, and as his dark presence creates discord, life is saved for aging flowers, accident victims (seen in presumed newsreel footage) and the aging certain to die as soon as he returns to his duties. Death searches for love during his brief visit with life, finding only fear in the souls of two of the beautiful women (Gail Patrick and Katherine Alexander) in attendance. Only one, the sweet Evelyn Venable, whose purity touches him, does not fear him, and this creates fear in the family as well as their visitors as they comprehend the truth.Almost operatic in its tragedy, this actually did become a critically acclaimed Off-Broadway musical drama. The film version of the stage play is solemn, yet not depressing or morbid. It certainly constitutes discussion, and "Death", itself, makes observations about the selfishness of the living in not accepting the act of death as part of life, and not letting the dead rest in peace.Venable's demeanor of the gentile noblewoman is almost saintly, as she seems to welcome Death's presence in her life without even an ounce of fear while her parents (Katherine Howard and Henry Travers) obviously have the earthly view of "She's too young to be taken" and "What will we do without her?". The beloved Helen Westley is sweetly noble as Standing's wife, while her matriarchal character in the musical became a maturing beauty played by the striking Rebecca Luker. While the title indicates that this could be either a comedy or a horror movie, it is in fact, a love story of two worlds forbidden from meeting, let alone falling in love. Of course, the cinematography is at times almost like the early sound horror movies, and it is indeed haunting. Director Mitchell Leisen prevents it from ever becoming sappy or mellow, and at the end, you might feel that the two forbidden lovers are triumphant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lovely, thoughtful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here is a film, which I have never before seen, which has Death, in the form of Frederic March, yearning to discover what it is about life that makes people so fearful and reluctant to let go of it. He interacts with people in an Italian villa to taste what it would be like to be one of the living. He falls smitten with lovely Evelyn Venable (who gives a fine, ethereal performance) and must decide between his own yearnings and the natural selection of things. This production is given a luxurious treatment by Paramount, and it is a beautiful film to look at. Thought provoking and with an ending you won't expect, it is an engrossing and well-made product of the 1930s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>March gives a poor performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setup for this romantic fantasy is kind of wonderful, but it immediately trips and falls face-first into the ground when Frederic March appears as Prince Sirki (the human disguise of Death himself). I really like Frederic March for the most part. I'd call his performance in Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde one of my all-time favorites. This performance, or perhaps it's just the character as written, is a huge miscalculation. He's supposed to be so darkly romantic that he makes all the younger women he meets swoon, but he comes off more as a cross between Count Dracula and Cousin Balki. The accent is just goofy, and those weird expressions on his face make him look like he's got to take a dump. The movie surrounding him isn't that bad - the dialogue is a little overwritten, maybe. The cinematography is really nice and the lead actress, Evelyn Venable, is gorgeous. Remade as Meet Joe Black with Brad Pitt in 1998 (haven't seen it).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't believe it but I actually prefer the Brad Pitt version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember seeing the Hopkins-Pitt version after it got ripped by the critics and was surprised that I actually thought it was pretty decent. Not great but an interesting movie with something to say and some good performances. I knew it was a remake of Death Takes A Holiday which was well regarded so I always looked forward to seeing the original. Well now I have and I can't believe I actually prefer the remake.Death Takes A Holiday: first of all, a terrible title for a movie with such a serious philosophical tone. It sounds like Mr. Smith Goes to Washington or Mr. Hobbs takes a Vacation. Meet Joe Black made the same mistake - people think they're getting a comedy not a discourse on the nature of life and death.Secondly, the acting is dreadful. That includes Frederic March, one of my all-time faves. Why he chooses to play death like Count Dracula I don't get. Everyone else is either terribly wooden or miscast.The tone of the film feels like a horror movie which is all wrong. Many of the characters blend into each other and I forget who is who or why they're even there. What else? Oh dialog and scenes go on forever and add little.What I liked was that they were willing to tackle such a weighty subject. Also the final scene was surprising and made me glad I stuck through it to the end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Don't expect 1934 version of Meet Joe Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story line is nothing like Meet Joe Black. The only thing the two movies have in common is that Death decides to take human form to find out why the living resist Death. The characters are typical of movies of this era - overacted, overly dramatic, too much makeup, almost comical. Death in 1934 forgets that he's trying to keep his identity secret, and he keeps letting slip little comments that reveal who he is. Death in 1998 has no such confusion; he is who he is, and it's for others to figure out why certain things amaze him so, such as peanut butter, tea cookies and the closeness of a woman. I thought the 1998 version was much richer, the premise was much more meaningful - taking human form so that he could learn from a man of good character why a life well lived had such great value. The 1934 Death seemed to just stumble upon this household of shallow elites who loved fast cars and parties. 1934 Death's focus seemed to be on women, and one melancholy woman in particular who welcomed Death into her life. His grand realization was that romantic love was the reason people resisted Death (huh?). The whole premise of the earlier movie just wasn't as deep as the later version. If you like the overly dramatic silliness of early movies, you'll probably enjoy this one. I was disappointed. In the category of early movies, this didn't come close to films like "It Happened One Night."</fullReview>
