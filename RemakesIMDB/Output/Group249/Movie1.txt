		<shortDescription>Classic film with powerful direction by John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the WWI raged in Europe British troops were fighting in a far corner of the world . Small solitary patrols moved over the vast Mesopotamian desert that seemed on fire with the sun . The molten sky gloated over them . The endless desert wore the blank look of death . Yet these men marched on without a murmur , fighting an unseen Arab enemy who always struck in the dark . A brave group (Wallace Ford , Boris Karloff , Reginald Denny , among others) of British cavalrymen lost in the desert are shot by the Arabs (Francis Ford , John Ford's older brother , appears in an uncredited role as an Arab) , one by one and twelve battered fighting men battle it out to the finish . Dead the official commander they are ulteriorly commanded by the sergeant (Victor McLagen) , then arise boiling passions in the burning sands .The movie gets brief psychological remarks about diverse character studios , especially the religious fanatic Karloff and although is completely developed on the wide desert , the tale results to be claustrophobic . Produced by RKO with a script by Dudley Nichols , usual Ford's screenwriter . Merian C.Cooper (King Kong) as executive producer intervened profoundly in this film along with main producer Cliff Red . The picture was shot for two weeks (1933) in Yuma desert which represented Mesopotamian desert (Modern Irak) . The temperature on the Yuma locations could be as hot as 150 degrees and actors were limited to working two hours a day . Philip McDonald (novel's author being based the movie) had been recruited in the British cavalry during WWI (1917) and he ulteriorly wrote an intrigue and suspense tale , adding his war memories . Also Andrew McLaglen actually served with the Irish Fusiliers in Mesopotamia during World War I at the same time this story takes place . Max Steiner's musical score was nominated for Academy Award , and this classic composer re-used the main title music he wrote for this film for the main title music for Casablanca , albeit with a slightly different instrumentation and tempo . Magnificent direction by the master John Ford and excellent interpretations make this a very good film . Subsequently remade and reworked several times : ¨Sahara¨ (by Zoltan Korda) with scenarios in Libya desert ; ¨Bataan¨(Tay Garnett) in Philippines jungle ; ¨Last of Comanches¨ (Andre De Toth) in Califonia desert ; and even part of ¨Flight of Phoenix¨ (Robert Aldrich) in Sahara desert . The motion picture will appeal to cinema classics moviegoers .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford is by far my favorite director</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No director impresses me more consistently than John Ford. Add The Lost Patrol to the list of his second tier triumphs - it's a cliche, but if anyone else had made this film, it would probably be their masterpiece. A British officer, riding through the Arabian desert in 1917, refuses to share his orders with his subordinates. When he is sniped by an unseen assailant, his six companions have to fend for themselves. They luckily run into an abandoned mosque, where they hold up. Their pursuers, on the other hand, now have them cornered, and start picking them off one by one. Victor McLaglen, a year before he performed his Oscar winning role in Ford's even better The Informer, was not yet pigeonholed as the Irish drunk. He has a straight British accent in this movie, which somehow makes him a bit less great, in my opinion. I just guess I have a soft spot for him as a lout! He's still excellent, however, as the troop's new captain. The other actors are also good. Especially worth mentioning is Boris Karloff as an overly religious man driven insane by the situation. That's a cliche now, but I'm guessing it wasn't in 1934. I don't think I've ever seen Karloff not buried under make-up. He's still playing a horror role, I suppose. At one point he slowly tries to escape the mosque, using a cross as a walking stick. God, what a beautiful scene. Ford's direction is brilliant. Although this is a slightly darker movie than many of his others, there are still several touching Fordian moments in which the soldiers discuss their families. McLaglen has a particularly wonderful moment as he converses about his son, whose mother died in childbirth. At first he hated the child, but he really couldn't help but love him. The smile on his face when he describes his son's life is enormously affecting. Max Steiner's score, although a bit overused at time, is mostly exceptional. At one point, the troop's situation seems about to be relieved. The music becomes triumphant. But a well-aimed bullet stops the score dead in its tracks. This is a great film. 9/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Exciting desert warfare film, compelling today, 60 years later. A fine Max Steiner soundtrack with excellent performances by Victor McLaglen, Boris Karloff, Reginald Denny and rest of cast. Unlike Gunga Din (1939) where the British were armed with U.S. Springfield '03 rifles and Colt revolvers of the early 1900's the weapons in Lost Patrol are authentically British WWI -- Lee Enfield rifles, the Lewis Gun from the airplane and it seems the officer's revolver is an Enfield of the period and attached to a lanyard in one scene. I see an underlying theme here that seems to have been overlooked. It is strongly anti-Christian throughout. Karloff as the religious fanatic soon to go mad brings on much of this, but not all. A couple of instances: Karloff reading the religious service over the body of the lieutenant is cut short by McLaglen, "Amen". Karloff confronts Reginald Denny telling of his pleasures of the flesh: "You must have faith!" Denny: "Why?" Karloff cannot answer. When Pvt. Pearson is buried, one suggests building a wooden cross for the grave. McLaglen: "Put his sword there. I think he would like that." Strange direction for John Ford, I would say! I have not read the novel "Patrol" that this film was based on. It would be interesting to learn if this theme is apparent. By the way, Lost Patrol was remade as "Sahara"(1943) with Humphrey Bogart. It is not nearly as good, but at the time it was a good wartime morale booster.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LOST PATROL from the British Army in Mesopotamia desperately defends itself in a tiny oasis from Arab attackers.John Ford directed this powerful Great War tale of agonizing heartbreak and desperate perseverance. The film becomes a character study as the eleven soldiers succumb, inevitably, to madness and snipers' bullets. Ford craftily keeps the Arabs unseen for an hour, making the implacable desolation of the sun scorched desert the men's worst enemy.British actor Victor McLaglen is the absolute backbone of the film. Beefy McLaglen--who had his own distinguished military career in World War One--is perfectly believable as the stalwart sergeant with the task of keeping his men alive at the water hole until relief can arrive. Bullying, blustering, brave, his is a heroic performance of a man fighting titanic odds.Gaunt Boris Karloff appears as a religiously fanatical private; his final scene, carrying a large cross up a dune, is especially memorable. Also in the patrol are Wallace Ford as a lively music hall performer and Reginald Denny as a gentleman with a past. Among the other men are good-natured Billy Bevan, sturdy Alan Hale and naive teenager Douglas Walton.Max Steiner's powerful soundtrack propels the plot onward to its inevitable conclusion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting and gripping desert war tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie in early 1950's in a local movie house that specialized in older movies. Hadn't heard of it before, and was delighted it was so good. A real "sleeper" from the past. I liked it very much then, and 15 or so years later, I caught it on TV, and managed to tape it. A classic soldiers survival story done right under John Ford's direction. The solid group of actors led by Victor McLaughlin do an excellent job here as British soldiers in Mesopotamia during World War I. Unusual role by Boris Karloff is believable. The enemy Arabs are unseen and pick off the soldiers one by one, adding to the suspense and drama. Good character development. I enjoyed it and awarded a "9".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>KARLOFF IS A BIBLE FANATIC!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Learned that this film was shot entirely on location near Yuma, Arizona with temperatures over 110 degrees. The music was created by Max Steiner and was nominated for an Oscar. This picture was also a remake of an earlier English film in 1929 of the novel. I also noticed there was not a woman in the cast, and no wonder, with all that heat during takes! During the First WW1, a patrol of British cavalrymen find themselves stranded in the Mesopotamian Desert. A veteran sergeant (Victor McLaglen) is in command. They camp at an oasis, and Arabs kill a sentry and steal their horses. It seems they are surrounded by unseen enemies and are killed one by one. The three remaining soldiers are: Morelli (Wallace Ford), the sergeant(McLaglen) and Sanders(Boris Karloff), a religious nut! Karloff goes insane, and creates a makeshift cross and starts across the desert. Karloff as usual has bulging eyes and tormented facial expressions. Boris made this film another great classic. It is a worthwhile enjoyable film to view.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Patrol (1934) ***1/2</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second film version of an archetypal adventure story is arguably the best despite some dated elements; John Ford deftly handles the proceedings and Max Steiner's stirring score - which at times foreshadows his later one for CASABLANCA (1942) - is a major asset. The solid cast of character actors is highlighted by Boris Karloff's remarkable turn as a religious fanatic who is slowly driven crazy by the amorality of his comrades and the futility of their struggle against unseen Arab attackers. The film can not only be seen to form part of the "British Empire" sub-genre of adventure films - with THE LIVES OF A BENGAL LANCER (1935), THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE (1936), THE FOUR FEATHERS (1939) and GUNGA DIN (1939) being its most notable contemporary examples - but, if one were to stretch it a bit, also paves the way for more modern stuff like John Carpenter's ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 (1976). It's unfortunate that nowadays, only the 66-minute reissue version seems to be available rather than the original, full-length 74 minute version. Over 20 years ago, I missed my one opportunity to watch this one on Italian TV and have been on the lookout for it ever since; however, I did manage to catch two similarly-themed wartime actioners, BATAAN (1943; with Robert Taylor) and SAHARA (1943; with Humphrey Bogart) over the years which were quite good in their own right. Curiously enough, Cyril McLaglen had played the same part played here by his brother Victor in the earlier 1929 British film version.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a rip-roaring adventure film set in the Mesopotamian desert during the First World War. It concerns a detachment of British soldiers holed up in a desert camp, where they are picked off one at a time by Arab snipers. Victor McLaglen's the star of the show, and very believable, as he had in fact played this sort of role in real-life, as a soldier, and always looked good in a uniform. The supporting cast, which includes Wallace Ford, Boris Karloff, Reginald Denny and Alan Hale, are all fine. John Ford directed the picture brilliantly, and this is in many ways a transitional film for him. His career had been in second gear for some time, and this one showed that he still had the old fire, and was a big box-office winner, which in turn led the studio to allow him to film his pet project, The Informer, the following year. And the rest, as they say, is history.Those who regard Ford as a quaint and sentimental pictorialist will be dazzled by this one. There isn't a wasted frame of film here, and the picture moves at a lightning pace. All of Ford's strengths and none of his weaknesses are on display in this one. Much of the action is synchronized to Max Steiner's score, as film music was still in its relative infancy at this time. Somehow this works in the movie's favor, as when McLaglen lurches at another character and the music accompanies his movement in such a way as to evoke King King, which Steiner had scored the previous year. The effect is sometimes frightening and quite powerful. Ford's sadistic humor comes out in odd and surprisingly frank ways. Karloff's religious fanatic is so over the top that he might have thrown the film off, yet Ford, rather than diminishing the character, decides to give him more screen time. There are moments when the character himself seems to be undermining the film. When he is tied up by the men, having proved himself to be nothing but an utter nuisance, he grins and wails in his captivity like a demented baboon. Karloff's quite funny here, giving the movie a respite from its own seriousness, which is very much needed. The film is, after all, about how men face death, and who's to say which way is the proper one?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Despite some flaws, the film still delivers an emotional feeling of helplessness.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's critically acclaimed film has lost some of its punch, but still delivers an emotional feeling of helplessness, as the lost patrol is menaced by unseen Arabs, and are picked off one by one until few are left. That feeling is reinforced when a rescue airplane lands and the pilot, unaware of the danger, cavalierly walks toward the men, who try to signal him to take cover. But there are bit too many dead spots between the action sequences. And Boris Karloff tends to overact his religious fanatic role, which got on everyone's nerve, including mine. Still, the film is beautifully photographed and has a good Max Steiner score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gripping War Film From the Distant Past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This early John Ford "talkie" (1934) crams in a lot of action and tension in just over an hour. It's the kind of classic film that could stand a good remake considering the subject matter and today's headlines in the Middle East. The plot is simple but effective. A dozen British soldiers on patrol in the Mesopotamian desert are attacked by an unseen force of Arabs. Their commanding officer is killed by a sniper and he was the only person who had knowledge of their exact location in the endless arid landscape. With no hope for reinforcements, the remaining soldiers are soon stranded on an obscure oasis and picked off one-by-one. Victor McLaglen is superb as the ranking sergeant trying to hold his dwindling force together. Boris Karloff is excellent (albeit a bit "over the top") as a religious lunatic who attempts to "convert" his comrades and the enemy to no avail. Adding to the suspense, the bewildered soldiers never see their attackers. The film's larger message regarding the utter futility of war hangs over the proceedings like a funeral shroud---but never gets in the way of the action. The surprising and shattering ending to this tale is one of the most unforgettable moments in 1930s cinema. Ford went on to make bigger pictures, but not too many were better than this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very good movie. It gets it point across with brevity and style. Some have complained about the acting style being too much like the silents. As a fan of silent movies, I consider that an asset rather than a failing.What dates this film is its attitude toward the war and the empire. In listing the good things in life, the sergeant mentions the sheer joy of killing Arabs. He says that Malayan women should be poisoned at the age of 21, since they are beautiful before that but not after. The racism and sexism of the empire is portrayed in all its dubious glory.But it is a very good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>THE Lost Patrol Reflects Ford's' Philosophy of Life</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's the Lost Patrol probably reflects Ford's views on life in general . Ford knew what he wanted in the way he handles the various actors in their parts and each fulfills their role admirably . Karloff is a bit over the top at times and evidently Ford wanted that . Ford's symbolism is reflected in the setting , the circumstances and the characters and is enhanced by Max Steiners' brilliant score . The characters are a " Grand Hotel " collection , but each having his own views about life and how death meets them.The setting is Mesopotamia , the original Garden of Eden as pointed out by Karloff . Here is Eden ruined by the fall of man , bleak , barren and deserted .There are only ruins with very little nourishment for sustenance . Death is represented by the unseen Arabs. It strikes without warning or without being seen . It strikes at the most inopportune times . All want an opportunity to fight this unseen enemy that has decimated their ranks.It strikes mercilessly and cruelly and shatters all hope . Man facing his mortality controls nearly all of the discussions and the reminiscing . The helplessness of man in the midst of his circumstances seems to be Ford's "arch" for this film . This is conveyed by the inability to see the enemy or know when he will strike . He steals the provisions needed to survive and there is no way to retrieve them .The seeming 'victory' of reaching the oasis shatters that illusion after the first night . One other commented on the anti-Christian ( or religious ) bias of Ford that shows itself in this picture . One strong point that Ford makes is that there is ' no help from above '. The airplane seems to be a sign that help has arrived , but that hope is soon shot down . Then the two men discuss that they know nothing about flying ( read religion ) . Their final act of helplessness and unbelief is to burn the plane . No help is coming from above ( God ) . I sat spellbound watching Ford weave a masterpiece of a tapestry of symbolism . Here is Ford at the top of his game and illustrating his genius whether you agree with his philosophy or not . This is not just a story ( and it is a great one at that ) , but it is man's response to life . That is where and why the attempted remakes have failed . They see only the struggle and try to focus on that . The struggle against odds has been done in every genre ,so they bring nothing new to the table . Ford used the struggle as a tableau for the deeper struggle of the basic dilemmas of man and life.I will watch this over and over .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Garden Of Eden?????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Patrol is set in of all places, Iraq. It takes place during the First World War when this was a very peripheral theater of operations in that way. But as Boris Karloff puts it, this small patrol could be standing on the Garden of Eden. Well we know that God expelled all the inhabitants of that place.It's no garden, but a small oasis where a small cavalry patrol commanded by Sergeant Victor McLaglen stops to camp for the night. They are besieged by a band of hostile Arabs who both are at war with the British and want that water.Bit by bit they're picked off. Will relief get to them and how many will be left before it's over. It doesn't get more basic than that.The Lost Patrol is a short running film, but manages to pack in a lot of good characterization. The various military types are shown here, everyone from the hedonistic Reginald Denny, to the fanatically religious Boris Karloff, to the callow youth Douglas Walton, to the tough professional soldier Victor McLaglen in charge of them all. John Ford directed this film and in McLaglen used one of his favorite players, a year before getting an Oscar for that other Ford classic, The Informer. As typical in a Ford film, there are some beautiful shots of the vast Mesopotamian desert over which our own troops now fight with a lot better communications and weaponry than these guys had. The foe hasn't changed any though.The Lost Patrol is as elemental as it gets, sheer survival until relief comes. Once you're viewing it you'll want to know how it all turns out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty good, but occasionally the characters acted a bit too "batty" to be realistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a movie that must have played a lot better back in 1934 than it would now. To many it's considered a classic, but I just felt that one stupendously clichéd performance and often irrational behaviors from many of the men helped to sink this drama to the level of "good but not especially memorable". About the only character who came off really well in the film was Victor McLaglen as the sergeant in charge of the lost group of British soldiers. The rest either were often just very irrational--mindlessly running across the dunes to either save someone when they are ordered NOT to or just to die because their character was being written out of the film. Many times, soldiers stood up during fire fights or did really dumb things for no apparent reason. One memorable example is the pilot who lands the plane without surveying the area--only to be shot as soon as he gets out of the plane! Had the British army REALLY been that stupid, there never would have been a British Empire!! An even bigger problem was Boris Karloff's character. Robert Osborne from TCM said that he was a character that movie goers "either loved or hated". I apparently was among those who hated him. He played a total maniac religious freak who is almost 100% insane. Don't you think the army would have somehow figured out he was nuts and given him his discharge papers long before this mission?! His wild-eyed expression and bizarre behavior are very reminiscent of the Jonathan Brewster character he played on Broadway in ARSENIC AND OLD LACE--not a soldier in what was at the time the finest army in the world!! If you edited out the stupid and irrational deaths and all of Karloff's performance, you are left with a pretty good film with an interesting premise--but that's a lot of film to remove and the remaining bits wouldn't make up an entire film. Overall, the movie isn't bad, just not all that good. A true time-passer and that is all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Odd movie for John Ford since what's on screen could have been done by a score of less talented directors. My guess is that his movie-making personality had yet to assert itself and that screenwriter Dudley Nichols is the molding force here. Clearly, Nichols is behind Karloff's wacky religious fanatic given Ford's generally sympathetic view of religious folks (The Searchers, for one). Note the parody of "Onward Christian Soldiers" as Karloff advances into the desert behind a huge crucifix. Such caricatures would largely disappear during the restrictive Code era soon to follow, 1934.True, the acting is pretty stagey as often happened with Ford, but exaggeration was not unusual for the time. Fortunately, the often comedic Victor McLaglen shows an effectively somber side, providing the movie's needed dramatic core. Note too, that there's little of Ford's celebrated poetic eye for natural landscapes. Instead, he films in pretty un- ornamented literal fashion. I agree with those who believe the film has lost much original impact. The florid acting, Karloff's especially, certainly doesn't help. And for that matter, neither does the British pilot who exits his plane looking and acting like he's going to a prom date instead of a war zone. There are the other implausibles pointed out by other reviewers, so no need to repeat them here. Unfortunately, the sum total of these negatives works against the film's effectiveness, especially for modern audiences.Nonetheless, there's still that really creepy element of instant death. It strikes the patrol suddenly and silently, stalking them like an evil metaphysical force. It's this unusual dimension, sort of like our worst nightmare, that continues to lend the movie real distinction and unnerve the viewer. Too bad, in my book, that the screenplay relents in the end when we see the men (Arabs) behind the force. Better that they had been kept out of audience reach and remained a shadowy presence throughout. But my guess is the script couldn't end by implying that the Arabs had won the battle. So eventually the natives get mowed down in good conventional fashion; McLaglen gets rescued in good conventional fashion; and the British colonialists ride into the sunset in good conventional fashion. One of the film's strengths is that it's ambiguous enough that we can't be sure how it will end. Thus the conventional ending for me is a disappointment, unworthy of what's gone before. Consider how forceful the film would be had no member of the patrol survived and the attackers remained unseen. That would have violated political correctness, but also resulted in a more memorable movie. After all, in real life, the so-called good guys don't always win, and sometimes it's helpful to be reminded of that. And sometimes an unhappy ending also makes for good, memorable cinema. Too bad this movie, with so much pre-Code potential, couldn't or wouldn't carry forward its unnerving side and end outside the box.</fullReview>

Placing our heroes in a situation where their location for home in uncertain(..and never knowing where the enemy is hiding)provides the viewer with little hope of any survival.Boris Karloff has a flashy scene-stealing role as a bible-thumper succumbing to craziness as he watches those around him dying.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Strangely affecting even with the falseness of some of the shooting and acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Lost Patrol (1934)A John Ford war movie five years before his breakthrough movie, "Stagecoach," is interesting at least in relation to his career. So I watched this (on Warner Archive Instant).And his lifelong themes are here?men in the wilds facing their weaknesses. His war films and westerns all have qualities of machismo, for sure, but they aren't just masculine adventure flicks. That's what makes even something like this minor effort stand up over time. When two of these men, after seeing their fellow soldiers die one by one, sit and smoke a pair of cigarettes and talk about themselves and their lives and their halted dreams, you have the depths of the movie. And of John Ford. The plot is a contrivance?a British WWI patrol gets lost in an Arabian desert with hostile fire around them. As each of the dozen or so men dies, either from standing up at the wrong time, making a run for it, or just losing their mind in the heat, you zero in on the few that remain. And on the idea of survival. But none of this is particularly realistic. In fact, most of the film is supposed to be a night and it's bright as noon. But Ford must have known it was a fable he was laying out, and he knew as well the realism he needed in the interactions between the men, all ordinary fellows. Except for one religious nut played with believable excess by Boris Karloff, and he also is a symbol of what their options are. And so it steadily dwindles on, the men and the film, honing down to the final moments of desperation. And then a big sudden end which feels about right. That's what is odd, somehow?the actions of the main characters become more and more realistic as they get more extreme.For those interested in Ford's famous blocking out of how his movies are shot, this is a decent example. Because most of it was shot on this oasis set, he could control within these confines the angles and the use of space of confinement well. Which is partly what the movie is about, too, thinking about either escape or entrapment and death. Not a great movie, but with an aura of greatness here and there and in the overview.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Plot</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is really a classic piece of work of what I don't know. I generally enjoy the older black and white movies and I don't mind making allowances due to age but here there is no room to cut any slack. We have a group of soldiers pinned down in an oasis by an unseen enemy. So far we have the basis for a good plot. But things go seriously awry from that point forward. First off the enemy as unseen as they are, are only attacking from one direction and although they seem to be able to move in and out of the oasis at will and kill guards as they want, why they just don't wipe everyone out is beyond me. Another plot hole and one of my favorites was in an enviorment with snipers lurking about why would any one climb up a palm tree and just perch on top is beyond me. Do I really need to say what happens next. I almost expected to hear the old cliché' issued in many a 1950 WW II movie.."Gee sarge there isn't an enemy within 50 miles" Bang! I don't think Boris Karloff could have over acted anymore had someone told him too. I mean this is bad to the point where he really gets annoying after the first two lines. After that your begging for someone to shoot him. The whole movie to sum it up is a group of people trapped doing stupid things that lead to their death. While the whole time the viewer is thinking one more down one step closer to the end. Bad film and not even worth looking at.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grim Lost in the Desert Drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The title of this film gives you the gist of the story. A British patrol is crossing a desert in 1917 WW1 in what is now Iran. The commanding officer is killed by a sniper's bullet taking with him the orders under which the patrol is to proceed.The sergeant (Victor McLaglen) is left in charge with no idea of what their mission was supposed to be. He decides to head north towards what he believes to be Brigade headquarters. The group stumbles upon an oasis complete with water and shelter. After refreshing themselves they discover that their horses have been stolen by the enemy. They are now marooned in the middle of nowhere with no hope of escape.Snipers begin picking off members of the patrol one by one until.........Victor McLaglen long a John Ford regular, stands out as the sergeant who tries to keep his men under control and hopeful of an eventual rescue. Boris Karloff plays Sanders a doomsday religious fanatic. He showed that he was a better actor than many believed at the time due to his many horror roles. Reginald Denny perhaps best remembered for his silly ass light comedy roles, is effective as Brown a man with a mysterious past. Wallace Ford plays Morelli a man who slowly becomes unglued as the tension mounts. Others in the cast are J.M. Kerrigan as Quincannon (there always seemed to be a "Quincannon" in Ford pictures), former silent comedy star Billy Bevan as Hale and Alan Hale in a blink or you'll miss him part, as Cook one of the soldiers.John Ford as always gets great performances from his actors. He had a reputation for browbeating them to the point that they would hate him but give exceptional performances as a result. "The Lost Patrol" is a low budget masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not bad at all</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE LOST PATROL is set in Mesopotamia, or what would be what we call modern Iraq, in the year 1917. Britain, along with several other world powers, is making its move to carve up the pieces of the broken Ottoman Empire. The lost patrol in this story is a group of British enlisted men, who've gotten separated from the main body of their regiment, and are in complete disarray due to the death from sniper fire of their patrol leader, which we see at the start of the film. The patrol has found some small sanctuary in the discovery of a small oasis, which contains an abandoned mosque. In attempting to hold ground, they are routinely eliminated by the Arab population of the region through the action of snipers, leaving only their Sergeant (McLaglen) to be rescued when the rest of the column finds the patrol location at the close of the film.The plot of the film is built around the trauma of battle fatigue, and the exhaustion of men sent to fight a war in a culture that is not their own. I was pleasantly surprised to find in viewing this film that John Ford strove to keep the portrayal of the racist current and cultural supremacy ideas that always exist among invading armies to a minimum, and instead chose to focus on the contradictions in the lives of these men so far away from their homes in England. Given the anti-Arab characterizations of our own era, THE LOST PATROL seems positively evolved by comparison. Victor McLaglen leads the cast, with able support from Reginald Denny as a mercenary, Wallace Ford as a displaced vaudevillian, and Boris Karloff as a religious fanatic. Among the many fine supporting cast members is Alan Hale Sr. in an almost invisible part, but for the few seconds he's on, he's really on.Like many others, I'd heard from the very first review I'd seen of this film written by Denis Gifford in his biography of Boris Karloff "The Man, the Monster, the Movies" (1973) that Karloff is way over the top in his portrayal. I don't think so, but that may have more to do with the edition that is available on DVD then anything else. Perhaps there are prints of this film that contain footage not available on the disc I was able to lay my hands on.Still, I think if anything, that Karloff seems to be overplaying it because many of his co-stars are actually under-playing the situation. In fact, the delivery of their lines seems somewhat glib and typical of the 1930s war film delivery and macho super white man characterization that rose to the fore between and after the two world wars. Some have said Karloff's portrayal of the religious fanatic who goes completely over the edge is anti-Christian, I think the actuality of combat fatigue and isolation has created far stranger emotional and mental disorders than Karloff attempted to re-create in this film. In my opinion, his performance, while far from stellar, is one of the stronger ones in this movie. Given Karloff's love of Joseph Conrad's novels and "Heart of Darkness" in particular, I believe he was trying to explore the mostly unrecognized nuttiness of the European invader and "civilizer" through the character of the religious fanatic Sanders. But that's just an opinion.THE LOST PATROL is an interesting period piece, and for admirers of the work of John Ford, I believe it's a must see. It's not bad at all, indeed, much better than I expected it to be, considering the portrayal of non-white people in most western films of the period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Perhaps because the sound quality was so bad, perhaps because nothing much seemed to be happening, but I didn't really like this film.It was rather downbeat, frankly.However, Victor McLaglen gave one of his best performances.He was not a bigger-than-life character, not a stereotype, but very life-like.Wallace Ford also gave one of his best performances, in what was one of his best roles.Watching this on TCM, I heard Robert Osborne say Boris Karloff's performance drew mixed reviews, and I come down on the side of those who said he was exaggerated.Since it is a classic, I believe everyone ought to see this, at least once. There was certainly a lot of talent, on both sides of the camera.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** Cut off in the fighting against the Turks a British patrol is lost in the vast Mesopotamian Desert trying to find it's way back to it's brigade. Almost out of water and ammunition the patrol lead by it's battle hardened sergeant, Victor McLaglen, finds it's way to this deserted mosque at first thought by the patrol members to be a mirage. Lucky for the patrol The mosque is by a water hole and surrounded by a score of Palm trees giving the men both the shelter and water that they desperately needs.It's at the water hole that the local Arab Bedouins encircle the patrol and one by one take out it's dozen or so soldiers with murderous sniper fire. As the British soldiers of the lost patrol start to panic at the thought of being annihilated by the unseen and sharp shooting Bedouins two of them McKay &amp; Cook, Paul Hanson &amp; Reginald Denny, decide to take a chance and go out to get help. The two are later found dead and viciously mutilated, with their eyes cut out,by the Bedouins.There's a slight chance that the surviving members of the patrol could have been saved when this British aviator,Howard Wilson, flew over the water hole as he spotted the Sergeant and Monelli, Wallace Ford. The soldiers were waving and shooting off their rifles at him in order to attract his attention, as well as that of the surrounding Bedouins. But the aviator being that he was either out in the sun too long or not knowing that there's a war going on and instead flying back to his British army, or RAF, air field he lands his plane. As he gets out of his cockpit and strolls towards the surviving patrol members, who are frantically trying to warn him to stay put in his plane, he immediately gets picked off by a Bedouin sniper!At the water hole one of the British soldiers Sanders , Boris Karloff, seemed to have gone off the deep end from he isolation and the blazing heat, as well as the Bedouin snipers. It's then when Sanders religious feelings about himself and his fellow soldiers start to take over his mind. The religious fanatic starts to think that he's in some way on a mission from God to not only save his lost patrol but what seemed like the whole world from the horrors of war. Sanders gets so impossible to handle especially after the aviator, whom Sanders thought was God's answer to his prayers, was shot and killed that he had to be tied up in the mosque by the Sarge and Morelli in order not to hurt them as well as himself.Breaking loose and making what looked like a makeshift cross and dressed in shack-cloth a mad as a hatter Sanders walks out into the desert, like a biblical prophet of old, only to be gunned down by the hidden Bedouins as Morelli tried to save the crazy kook only to be shot down and killed as well. Being the only one left alive of his patrol the Sarge who earlier had set the aviators plane on fire, in order to attract his fellow British soldiers, is now prepared to meet his maker. The hidden Bedouins, thinking that all the platoon members are dead, come out in the open and unknowing to them giving Sarge for the first time in the movie a chance to avenge his dead and fallen comrades.1934 war classic thats been copied, but rarely equaled, many times since that brings a major conflict into focus. Instead of showing massive battles with thousands of soldiers participating in them "The Lost Patrol" shows how war effects just a handful of combatants. Who in the case of the Arab Bedouins where not on either side, the Turks or the British, of the conflict but were just protecting their turf or desert from foreign invaders.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining Ford's film that created sequel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The lost patrol" is a remake of a silent film sound British with the same title, held in 1929. The story is based on a novel by Philip MacDonald, a veteran of World War campaign fought in Mesopotamia. The campaign is very little known, in my opinion for two reasons. The first is that the quotas were not very numerous and fought in a remote and arid. The second is that initially was a disaster for the British and encompasses one of the greatest military blunders of that country: the siege of Kut.The plot is fairly simple, and very reminiscent of those of other productions, military, past and present. A small group of British soldiers trapped in an oasis surrounded by Arab raiders. No wonder that Ford decided to direct this remake, if we change "oasis" with "strong" and "Arab" with "Redskins", we have the typical production of the Far West. But if we think, that this plot is very much later in other productions, such as "The Flight of the Phoenix", "Southern Comfort" or "Alien".Two things stand out in this movie. First, its short duration: 65 minutes. Second, it is not starring big stars. Boris Karloff is the most famous of all that gives life to just unhinged religious fanatic. The other protagonist is Victor McLaglen, a regular in the production of Ford and interpret the unforgettable and stubborn Will Danaher in "The Quiet Man". In this movie is "the sergeant," a veteran who will be in charge of the patrol officer after losing her. As curiosity is the fact that the first version of this work the character of "Sergeant" was played by Cyril McLaglen, Victor's brother. And Victor himself was a veteran of the campaign in Mesopotamia."The lost patrol" school and I think it may be one of the minor works of John Ford, but keep in mind that directed a legend and it would probably be considered a masterpiece if he had taken any other director. A great classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The wonder of the desert is it's immensity. In it, man and time blend to create the illusion of life, when in fact, it's tugging it into the shifting sands. This early Black and White film depicts the story of a British Desert Patrol, written by Philip MacDonald and is directed by John Ford. The film begins with the commanding officer being killed and ironically enough, is the only one who knows where the Patrol is headed. From then on, the cast which has Victor McLaglen playing The Sergeant arrive at a desert Oasis and do their best to survive against desert tribesmen who are systematically killing the soldiers. Boris Karloff plays Sanders, a conscience ridden soldier who succumbs to the desert isolation by becoming a religious fanatic. With Wallace Ford, Reginald Denny and Alan Hale in the cast, the movie becomes a study of men, each with his own thoughts on life. This is a wonderful, though at times a bit over the top film, but one which has established itself a an early Classic. Good Show. ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Disapppointingly light war film with Karloff and McLaglen</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really didn't enjoy the film very much, even though it's a well made movie with some really exceptional aspects.First off -- let me say I really enjoyed the very beginning of the movie, the first 2 minutes or so. I loved how he showed the young officer being killed from a distance before we know who he is or how important it was that he lives. It's a fascinating technique which I've only previously seen used in Westerns like "Johnny Guitar".Now, the movie itself is a bit of a bore for me.... the whole movie they were holed up in an oasis as Arab snipers killed them one by one. As my girlfriend noted, it was interestingly similar to a later era horror film, with the audience perhaps taking part in a guessing game of "who will be the next to die?". It was effective for Ford to only show the effects of the Arab snipers, and not the snipers themselves, though he kind of ruined it by the film's end. There's also a very "horror-like" scene where they are almost rescued by a man in an airplane who is killed by the Arabs, a device that reminded me of "almost" rescue attempts in horror films such as "The Shining".Speaking of horror, how bout that Boris Karloff? I thought he was pretty weak in this one really. There were times when his performance was good, in a silent movie kind of way. But IMHO he was too far over the top. It is a very cool image of him at the end, walking up that trench with his crucifix. But none of it is remotely believable, and I can't see much symbolic significance either.McLaglen is really excellent, though. I liked how he was subdued and maintained the illusion of total control, right up until the moment that all of his men are dead and then he absolutely snaps.An uneven film, I think, well directed by Ford and certainly very well photographed by Wenstrom, but it feels like an A movie trying to burst out of the seams of a B movie skeleton.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak at first but gets much better as it goes on despite some obvious limitations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the World War raged in Europe, British troops were fighting in a far corner of the world. Small solitary patrols moved over the vast Mesopotamian desert, that seemed on fire with the sun. The molten sky gloated over them. The endless desert wore the blank look of death. Yet these men marched on without a murmur, fighting an unseen Arab enemy who always struck in the dark ? like a relentless ghost! We join one such patrol as the senior officer is killed by a sniper and the group are left with no orders and no idea where they are in the desert.In theory this film should be a dark and tense film that starts with the type of sunny, "lads together" squadron of men but gradually descends into tension and in fighting as the unseen forces close in on them. With negative reviews on this site I did have my worries that it would fail to do this but, despite some glaring problems early on, this is actually a really enjoyable film that does well considering the period it was made in. The limitations of the film are obvious early on because this is very much of its time and it hasn't dated that well in areas such as acting but as the film goes on these slipped away for me as I got sucked into it more and more.Ford contrasts the wide open space of the desert with the confines of the oasis hut really well to produce the two effects at the same time ? like dying of dehydration in the middle of an ocean. The use of sets and back projection is obvious at times, but only really by today's standards, mostly it looks convincing. The story uses the characters well and their gradual slide into hysteria compliments and adds to the sense of danger closing in. It didn't have the ending I had hoped for but this is still pretty dark fare when you consider the sort of aversion films had in the 1930's to seeing "good guys" killed off ? particularly by Arabs (although the film would be a good remake, that aspect would pretty much need to go for US tastes).As already stated, some of the acting is a bit ropey or hammy. However for me this was mostly a problem early on when all the characters were wooden squaddie types. As the film wore on, performances got better with more material and the slide into slight hysteria tended to cover up the hammier performance. Karloff was pretty poor early on because he did tend to exaggerate everything as he does, however later in the film this doesn't stand out as badly (although it is hardly "good" at any point). I liked McLaglen because he was convincing from start to finish and Ford was one of those that got better with the varying of his material. The rest are more fodder but they still did so-so. The Oscar winning score (so I'm told) was good in itself but I didn't think it was used particularly well; at times it seemed plastered on and rather than setting the mood (as it was clearly intended to do) it got in the way and I didn't appreciate the way I felt it was leading me by the nose into a certain tone.Overall this is much better than I expected. Yes it has its limitations and parts of it were of the time and don't look/sound so good now but in essence it does what it does pretty well. The story is simple but is tense and engaging and, like the acting, gets better as the film goes on. An early one from John Ford then but one that is still worth a look so long as you can get past the weak opening stages.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boris Karloff in a John Ford Movie? Yes, Please!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A patrol of British soldiers is lost in the Mesopotamian desert in WWI. The men happen upon a desert oasis and hole up there. Soon they find themselves surrounded by Arabs that pick them off one by one. A great cast helps make this one of director John Ford's early winners. Victor McLaglen, Reginald Denny, Billy Bevan, and Wallace Ford are among the recognizable faces in the cast. But it's horror legend Boris Karloff as an insane religious fanatic that steals the show. Judging by some of the reviews here, not everybody loves his performance. Some think he's over the top. Perhaps he is but I think it works quite well for the role and adds some flavor to things. This sort of story's been done many times over since but rarely better. A classic must-see for Karloff and Ford fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Lost Patrol makes its way well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the inept officer in charge of a small detail fails to convey his orders to his second in command before being eliminated by an unseen enemy in the Mesopotamian dessert the detachment heads north on a hunch. With water running low they find an oasis. On the first night the horses are stolen and a trooper killed. The invisible enemy begins to increase the body count with no relief in sight when a bi-plane spots them but the ordeal is far from over. One of director John Ford's better early sound works The Lost Patrol is carried the entire way by an unrelenting sense of desperation conveyed by the pinned down patrol with the suspense heightened by keeping his villains offstage until the climax along a quick twist at the end. Ford economically develops his characters in the brief moments with each giving a capsule bio while scanning the dunes emphasizing both humanity and the loss that follows. With most of the picture taking place in an oasis less than an acre in size and a fine music score by Fritz Steiner Ford managed to get the most out of his small cast and the magnificent horizontals and light and shadow of the sultry and foreboding Garden of Allah (Yuma, Arizona) competently lensed by Harold Wenstrom. It is a compact epic adventure that conveys the same impact the king size might only achieve through a variety of scenes and sets along with a cast of thousands.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This couldn't have been the first of the genre but it may be the most popular and still packs a wallop despite the familiarity of the plot. In brief, a British patrol of some half dozen men are lost in the Arabian desert in World War I. They are stuck in an oasis with plenty of water and dates but no hope. One by one, they're picked off by unseen enemy snipers until only Victor McLaglen, the top sergeant, is left.In these movies, there are always a couple of adumbrations of tragedy. First of all, you don't want to be the officer who's in charge. He's always the first one to get it. Second, never climb a tree in a war movie. Third, if the camera moves in on you and allows you to express your deepest thoughts to a comrade, even if those thoughts are shallow, you'd better make sure your life insurance policy is up to date. Fourth, you may or may not survive, but, since you're the last man alive, you'll have plenty of automatic weapons around to slaughter the enemy when they finally confront you.The musical score is by Max Steiner and the movie was shot near Yuma, California, in 1933, only a few years after sound was introduced, so there's hardly a moment without music behind it. If there is a shot of a Scotsman standing guard at the edge of the oases, you will hear bagpipes. The music is what was known as "Mickey Mouse music" because if, say, Mickey Mouse took a tumble down the stairs, the music followed him down -- plunk plunk plunk -- into the lower register, emphasizing the action on the screen. "King Kong" was full of it too."The Lost Patrol" established a genre in which the company is slowly whittled down by a faceless enemy. It was a good formula, and you can see it used to good effect in "Bataan" in 1942. In "The Lost Patrol," McLaglen survives and is rescued by the cavalry but that was okay because, after all, the Allies won World War I. I'm afraid in "Bataan" there are no survivors, but then the message in 1942 was no longer "we won" but rather "we will win someday." (Kids: 1942 was a terrible year for the Allies, who were then fighting what was called "World War II." We were not winning. There was some question of whether we WOULD win, so movies advised us to hang in there together despite setbacks. Got it? Fine.) In "Red River," the director Howard Hawks commented on a funeral scene that he held up shooting for a few minutes until the shadow of a cloud passed over the mourners. He thought it looked nice. In a voice suggesting a bit of puzzlement, he added, "John Ford does that all the time." This was directed by Ford and you can find an example of what Hawks meant when two of the soldiers pack up some canteens and trudge off into the desert to try to find help. It's a hopeless task. And as their tiny figures move away into the blinding landscape of sand dunes, a cloud shadow almost imperceptibly darkens them, prefiguring their deaths.I've kind of made fun of "The Lost Patrol" and in fact it does look and sound a little dated, but it was fairly original at the time. Ford and his performers handle the story deftly. Nicely done job.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's visual poetry, but not much else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a fervent admirer of John Ford's movies, I was disappointed with this one. By the time he made The Lost Patrol, Ford was already an accomplished director, with a good number of silent and sound films to his credit, and you can see his skill here with pictorial composition, action shots, and landscapes. But the story and characters leave much to be desired, as does Max Steiner's score.The characterizations are stereotypical and even ham-fisted. We have the fatherly sergeant, the crazy religious fanatic, the drink-loving Irishman, the 'arf a mo' cockney, the eager young recruit, and so on. This would be acceptable if so much of the movie were not dedicated to presenting their back-stories. For an action picture, there is an awful lot of talk here, none of it very interesting. (Some of them sound awfully American for Brits, but that's another matter.) The contrast between these lovingly detailed soldiers and the "Arabs" they are fighting is stark. We see more than enough of the human side of the soldiers, but we don't even see the faces of the Arabs. They are cloaked figures, regularly subjected to hateful comment by the soldiers but never actually appearing as real people. When they are killed, we are meant to feel satisfied and glad. The Arabs are even more dehumanized than the Indians killed off in droves in so many cowboy films, including some by Ford in later years. In fact, other than the vaguely seen cloaks that they wear, we don't even know what distinguishes an Arab from anybody else. We never see one of them up close or hear them speak.Ford had a weakness for a certain kind of ethnic humor, like the stereotypical fighting, drinking Irishman, whom we are meant to find colorful and lovable. It shows up here, and, as elsewhere, it's not all that funny. Then again, one of the few Ford movies I find unwatchable is a much-praised Irish movie full of fighting and other "colorful" behavior--The Quiet Man.Max Steiner's score for The Lost Patrol has also been praised. Like Ford, he was a master, but he too had a weakness--for weaving allusions to familiar tunes into his scores. In this movie, he quotes all sorts of military and patriotic songs. There's more quoting here than original music.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Overall Good Movie That Continually Picks Up Steam Throughout</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This starts out on a very dramatic note as the officer in charge of a British patrol somewhere in the desert (it's presumably World War I and the desert is presumably in Iraq, since later in the movie there's a mention of "Mesopotamia") is shot by a sniper as he leads his troops. The problem? The officer hasn't shared his orders with anyone, so the patrol (now led by a Sergeant) has no idea what it's supposed to do, or where it's supposed to go. So, the basic premise is set up right from the start. After that dramatic opening, the movie does plod along a little bit for a while, with nothing much for the viewer to do but watch the soldiers traipse through the desert. It picks up steam again, though, when the patrol stumbles upon an oasis with an abandoned mosque. This provides water and shelter, but also makes them a fairly easy target for the mysterious snipers, who start to pick the patrol off one by one.This is a pretty good movie. It gets a bit wordy at times as the various soldiers reflect on their personal lives, and while we do learn a lot about what they have back home, it seemed artificial - people generally don't talk that way. Still, there's real suspense involved as the movie winds down, because you really don't know if any of these guys are going to be able to come out of this alive. In addition to Victor McLaglen as the Sargeant, the cast is highlighted by Boris Karloff as a soldier who's also a religious fanatic. I wasn't taken by his performance at first. He seemed to have an other-wordly look and sound that would have suited his character of Ardath Bey in "The Mummy" but didn't seem - at first - to work here. But as the movie goes on, and Karloff's "Sanders" begins to go insane under the pressure, that type of presence begins to make sense and actually works quite well by the end. A very good movie. 7/10</fullReview>

The actor's career would peak the following year with a Best Actor Oscar for "The Informer," another Ford film before he became a reliable member of Ford's stock company of supporting actors. Karloff, taking a break from a string of horror films he was making during the time, is horribly over-the-top as a religious fanatic. The premise of the story is compelling and the desert cinematography is impressive but the uneven script fails to sustain the interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE LOST PATROL plods along in the desert sun accompanied by a Max Steiner score that gives some life to the proceedings, as a small group of British cavalry gets lost on the hot desert sands and takes refuge in an oasis.VICTOR McLAGLEN is head of the patrol and he's his usual blustery self and BORIS KARLOFF is a Bible quoting soldier devoid of his usual horror make-up. In other supporting roles are REGINALD DENNY, excellent as a gentleman soldier and WALLACE FORD and DOUGLAS WALTON as the lesser of the ill-fated soldiers. ALAN HALE has a brief role, as does SAMMY STEIN as a robust Jewish soldier. DOUGLAS WALTON is sensitive as the nineteen year-old soldier comforted by McLaglen when overcome by fear and fatigue.Once the lost patrol reaches the oasis, it becomes clear that there's a stagey quality to the dialog in an attempt at character development, but McLaglen remains genuinely convincing as the tough but tender-hearted man who has to keep his men alert in the face of Arab snipers.The action is slow, but Steiner's music has a mixture of exotic flavors mixed with the feeling of wind, sand and military themes. For '34, the very fact that the music is so prominent is an unusual factor.A wild-eyed Karloff tells Reginald Denny: "You're a gentleman. You must have faith!" and Denny, after extolling the virtues of women natives, says: "Why?" Once again, McLaglen has to take a firm hand in keeping his men under control. Karloff, with a mad stare in his eyes, eventually goes out of his mind and has an unusual final scene.The story ends with McLaglen the last man standing by the time the cavalry arrives and everyone marches off into the desert dunes while Steiner's music reaches a pitch of military flavor.Not bad, but not the best of John Ford either. Watchable mostly for McLaglen's performance which is worthy of an Oscar nomination--but the only nomination went to Max Steiner's score.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When This Patrol Got Lost, Brother, Did It Get Lost!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With this film now being 80 years old, I believe that it deserves to be at least cut some sort of slack in spite of its many flaws and irksome short-comings.But, with that said, the truth is, when it comes to a "War" picture (this time it being WW1), The Lost Patrol was actually quite a bore for the most part.This picture's story suffered considerably from it containing far too much talk-talk-talk and not enough action.As well, this film was very racist in its depiction and attitude towards Arabs who were never given a fair chance to be viewed as "real" people (as the English soldiers were).Instead, the Arabs were clearly portrayed as being vicious (almost unseen) assassins (always dressed in traditional Arab garb) who were pretty much summed up perfectly in the saying that goes - "There's no good Arab like a dead Arab." I'd say that these Arabs (who never utter a single word) were even more dehumanized than were the Indians in so many of director John Ford's later pictures.Set in the year 1917, one of The Lost Patrol's pluses was the impressive setting which took place in Iraq's Mesopotiama desert (which was in reality the Arizona desert).The stark, desolate beauty of this location was very nicely photographed and this greatly enhanced the "lost" and hopeless situation of the British soldiers who were being stalked across this vast, sandy plain by their cunning enemy who knew this endless wasteland like the back of their own hand.One of this film's biggest deficits was Boris Karloff as Sanders, the raving, religious nutter who spewed out passages from The Bible as if he were doing it while in the midst of a painful defecation.Believe me, Karloff's over-the-top, unintentionally laughable performance was so bad that it literally stank to the high heavens.Filmed in b&amp;w, this picture (with its all-male cast), thankfully, only had a running time of just 72 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a master piece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this movie more than 30 ago at the TV - I was 10 of age +/- - and see it one more time yet as a teenager. I can't say is the best Ford's movie. I hardly know deeply is films to say that. I seen it for the third time now in a DVD. It a marvelous film both in is images as in sequences of happenings. The empty landscapes and the close-ups on the faces are alternate in a fantastic fusion with the things that happen or are supposed to happen. This is a film of no concessions, made surely with poor resources, far from a great production, however the density of the events and of the persons appears in it's roughest state with no camouflage or glamor. I wonder how much did Herzog saw this movie to make Aguirre.The most touching of Ford's movies for me; until now. A truly masterpiece.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I still remember it from the '30's seeing it as a kid. It foretold war in the desert, war at the "grunt" level. Any small unit today who lost their GPS, unit radio, and was stranded in the desert might revert back to the fears of ordinary persons in a lethal surrounding.How can we get this movie today ?

		<shortDescription>Get Lost in the Desert in The Lost Patrol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A bunch of men get lost in the windy desert oasis of the Foreign Legion, and can't help but get picked off by unseen Arab enemies. Whatever they were fighting for didn;t seem worth the endless sands they are set on. Led by intrepid (and Oscar winner for 1935's The Informer) Victor McLaglen and tempted by super-religious Boris Karloff (in another "pre-Frank role") to turn to God, this disbanded band of soldiers must fight to the death in 100+ degree heat. There's even a critical biplane overhead that somehow figures late into the plot. These movies set in minimalist, claustrophobic locales have to rely on dialogue, internecine squabbling, and rescue of some sort to prevail to its viewers...The Lost Patrol is no different, and early Karloff gives an eerie view into what was to come in his future roles and his effective use of that Britich baritone, slight lispy voice. If you're into Karloff, don't miss this non-monster flick. A "9" in my book.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worth a look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Strong story and a good cast help this one from RKO. Hard to dislike a film like this, but it has dated badly. Acting is uneven. Has the look of "an old movie" which doesn't help it at all today. However, Ford directed it and Max Steiner wrote the very impressive musical score. You can't go wrong with these two movie pioneers behind the scenes. Was remade several times under different titles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing cliché-setter.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I always try to make allowances for the age of a film, and this is one of few of the early 1930s to be shown on British TV recently. Let's be kind and say it was an early example of a film portraying a situation that was to become very popular - a handful of people (soldiers, crashed airmen, US cavalry and/or civilians) besieged by hostile natives and dealing with it in different ways. Most later films, including lesser Westerns of the 1950s, did it a whole lot better.So many of the characters and parts of the plot of "The Lost Patrol" were to become clichés, and this word is one that sprang to mind many times when viewing the film. A bit unfair, perhaps, because contemporary reviewers seem to have liked it. There were long exchanges of dialogue to establish the backgrounds and personalities of the soldiers, but I couldn't find much sympathy for any of them, apart perhaps for McLaglen. Karloff overacts, and the score may have won an Oscar but it grated. At one stage McLaglen peers out into the desert and wishes that something would move; what about the plot, I thought.There were two memorable scenes: Karloff approaching the Arabs with his cross, and McLaglen dumbly pointing to the graves of his comrades.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has Dated Poorly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there was ever a movie whose dated production values let down its very effective premise THE LOST PATROL is it . Philip McDonald's story of a British Army patrol being picked off one by one by Arabs in 1917 Mesopotiamia is compelling enough and no doubt works very well on the written page but this 1934 adaptation has dated very badly . I am trying to be very forgiving , something that other people on this page have tried but something I personally am not very good at The main bugbear is the acting . In those days actors were used to acting on stage which is entirely different from film acting where the camera picks up on every little nuance and _expression which greatly exaggerates what the actor is trying to convey . Watching THE LOST PATROL in 2006 means you're stuck by how hammy everything is . Again I'm trying to be forgiving but I can understand people falling out laughing if they were to watch this . Karloff especially comes off as being far too over the top , even though inevitably you could make the same criticism of nearly any other religious fanatic seen in cinema with perhaps the only notable exception being piper Laurie in CARRIE . Despite being Oscar nominated I did find Max Stiener's score very intrusive adding even more irritation to the unsubtle aspects of the movieWhere the film does work is in the characterisation . All too often in movies the military characters are just cyphers there to spout lines and despite some criticisms of how the parts are played you do believe that these guys are a very good cross section of the British army in 1917 . And of course all the tension centres around on who gets killed off next , a bit like TEN LITTLE INDIANS set in the desert A flawed film whose dated qualities stop far short of it being called a classic . Despite this there's enough bare bones for it to be a contender for a remake . Think about it . Mesopotiamia is now in present day Iraq and we could see a film where a British patrol of 1917 finds itself cut off from reinforcements by Sunni nationalists as they describe a cruel and ruthless enemy without the story becoming consciously post modernist</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford Missed The Mark on this One !</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If ever there was a totally forgettable war movie this is it! It is wildly overacted with a very obvious plot- in short it commits the one unforgivable sin in a war movie -it is boring! Some allowance has to be made for the fact that it was made in 1934 but there were war movies made in the 1930's that were excellent such as All Quiet On the Western Front and Beau Geste. The acting of Vic McLaughlin is the one bright spot in the show but he can't overcome a terrible script and as others have commented Boris Karloff's Bug Eyed frothing at the mouth performance is embarrassing! John Ford was to become a great director so he was just learning his trade at the time this was made but he lost his way on this one !! Nobody's perfect !</fullReview>
