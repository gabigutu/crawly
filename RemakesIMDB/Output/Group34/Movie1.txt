		<fullReview>This is why we go to the movies. Great story telling, great characters, great actors, great directing, suspense, a certain pace and so on... a perfect movie. Why, oh why they don´t make movies like this anymore? Why are we treated to flicks like "King Arthur"? Have we lost it?It´s all about adventure. Suspense, thrill, wit....Well, they would nowadays add some cruelties and that would be okay but it still would be superior to 99,9% of recent Hollywood flics.Come back Capra, Hawks, Frankenheimer, Zinnemann, Ford, Hitchcock, Lang et al. - please come back10/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Foreign Legion Epic very well done.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I know this, along with Sherlock Holmes, is one of the most filmed stories ever, but the 1939 version must stand out as the best. The mood and atmosphere of the desert is captured brilliantly, the photography is excellent as is the cast. Gary Cooper fits the role of Beau exactly as one would have imagined him, while the brothers played by Ray Milland and Robert Preston are spot on. Of course Brian Donlevy was at his best in this film as the vicious Sergeant, and it is one of the few times when I have thought he acted well. Susan Hayward's role was minor, but of course she was a virtual unknown at that time. It was good to see Donald O'Connor as a young Beau, as well as stalwarts like Albert Dekker and J. Carrol Naish. The opening scene is quite remarkable even by todays standards.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Rousing adventure when Hollywood knew how...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fine film wears exceedingly well more than 60 years after it was made. The story of a jewel with a haunted past, a trio of gallant brothers, a beautiful girl and the French foreign Legion make for for a mighty entertaining diversion. Brian Donleavy's riveting Oscar performance, as brutal Sargent Markoff, alone is worth the price of admission. Excellent acting all around From Gary Cooper's Beau Geste, his two stalwart 'brothers' played by Ray Milland and Robert Preston to that of J. carrol Naish as the 'human hyena' Rassinoff and Albert Dekker plays a menacingly mutinous legionaire. A great story of love and loyalty set in a rousing adventure film. A must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brotherhood, Leadership and Gratitude</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The orphan brothers Beau, John, and Digby Geste have been raised in Brandon Abbas by their dear aunt Lady Patricia Brandon (Heather Thatcher) with the also adopted Isobel Rivers and their cousin Augustus Brandon since they were children. Lady Brandon is near bankruptcy paying the debts of the absent Lord Brandon, and the fortune of the family is limited to the valuable "Blue Water" sapphire. When they are grown-ups, Lord Brandon tells that he will arrive in the property to sell the precious stone. Beau (Gary Cooper), John (Ray Milland), Digby (Robert Preston), Isobel (Susan Hayward) and Augustus (G. P. Huntley) ask to see the "Blue Water". Lady Brandon brings the stone, but the lights go out, the sapphire is stolen and Lady Brandon promises to call the police on the next morning. However, first Beau and then Digby write notes confessing the robbery, and they are followed by John. The brothers join the Foreign Legion and are sent to North Africa, Beau and John under the command of the cruel and sadistic Sergeant Markoff (Brian Donlevy) in Fort Zinderneuf in the Sahara Desert. After an unsuccessful mutiny due to the brutal treatment of Markoff, the fort is attacked by Tuaregs and the men have to join forces to fight for their lives."Beau Geste" is a dramatic adventure about brotherhood, leadership and gratitude. I have never watched the original version, but this remake is a great movie. The screenplay is intelligent, with two initial mysteries (what has happened in Fort Zinderneuf?, and why Beau Geste stole the stone?) and reveals the mystery in the fort in the end and the reason why Beau Geste stole the jewel in the very last scene, showing how honorable and gentle he was. Brian Donlevy is amazing and together with Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston, they have unforgettable performances. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Beau Geste"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The three Geste brothers, wards of their Aunt Patricia, go off to the Foreign Legion because they are suspected of stealing a family jewel, the Blue Water sapphire. It's a question of family honor and pride back in the day when this was thought to be a real virtue.Beau Geste continues as a story about the Geste brothers in the Foreign Legion. Since they are all adopted wards with no clue as their real origins, that might account for the distinctly non-British speech of Gary Cooper as Beau and Robert Preston as Digby. Ray Milland as the youngest brother John was presumably influenced by British speech at a young enough age.Though the three brother leads perform more than adequately, Beau Geste is truly a film where the character actors take over. Brian Donlevy was given his one and only Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actor as the sadistic Sergeant Markov. You won't forget him, I promise you. Three others that also stand out are Albert Dekker who leads a mutiny against Markov at the distant outpost of Fort Zinderneuf and Stanley Andrews as Maris who tries to prevent the mutiny. And last but certainly not least is J. Carrol Naish who is Rassinov the eyes and ears of Markov among the men. Naish was an amazingly versatile character actor who played just about every ethnic type you could name. He blended into his characters so well he almost has no identity of his own on screen. And that hyenish high-pitched cackle that he uses for Rassinov will linger with you forever.Susan Hayward is in this also as the love interest for Ray Milland. She's young and pretty wasted in a thankless role in a male dominated film. No hint at all here of the characters she later portrayed like Lillian Roth or Barbara Graham.Beau Geste is the kind of adventure story for those who like their heroes gallant and romantic as so many of us do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful Gesture.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who know Julien Duvivier's "la bandera"(1935) will find analogies between the two movies.In both of them, the legion is an escape from law.The approach is different however:in "la bandera",the hero and his mates are simple,crude people.In Wellmann's work,they are distinguished,"noblesse oblige" characters.Wellman's movie has a romantic flavor,which is totally absent in Duvivier's pessimistic story.It seems that "beau geste" has worn well,better than Duvivier's dated saga.Both movies have the same flaw:the Tuaregs are the "villains",we absolutely know nothing about them.In Duvivier's movie,we don't even see them,and they are always referred to as "the bastards" (sic)They seem reduced to attacking baddies,an entity whose humanity is denied. Wellmann's superiority lies in the fact that he plays the game of adventure ,now matter how unlikely it is while Duvivier has "realist" ambitions.Wellmann smartly blends a whodunit with pure adventure elements.The solution of the mystery,which we learn at the very end of the movie is very unexpected and gives the movie some kind of Hustonian touch (and in 1939,Huston had yet to make a movie!)As for the directing is concerned,the last third of the movie shines.If the legion routine life scenes inside the fort are inferior to those of Duvivier,on the other hand its finale is more moving and more astonishing.The sergeant,using dead bodies as scarecrows ,is almost surrealist and might have influenced the conclusion of Anthony Mann's "Cid".A scene we saw at the beginning ,"the Viking funeral" finds an absolutely brilliant explanation .While John (Ray Milland) is preparing the "ceremony" in a fort full of dead bodies,we don't realize.It's only when he explains to his brother (yes,there was a dog at his feet)that we understand.A very fine cast,including Susan Hayward on the threshold of a brilliant career (it's her second movie).The title is justified too.Because "Beau Geste" means in French "Beautiful gesture".NB: A trip to Norway taught me this:the Vikings were buried in the ground on their boats.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A magnificent blue sapphire is stolen from the English estate of Brandon Abbas. BEAU GESTE and his two younger brothers are all suspected of the crime. To save their family from dishonor, they each make their way to join the French Foreign Legion. In the emptiness of North Africa, supported only by their love for each other, they will encounter pure evil...Not only a wonderful adventure story, BEAU GESTE is also a morality tale on the true meaning of courage, the loyalty of brother for brother, and the responsibilities of virtue when confronted by absolute evil. Examined this way, the film can be enjoyed by the thoughtful viewer on many levels.In the title role, Gary Cooper is excellent, exuding quiet strength &amp; righteousness. Robert Preston &amp; Ray Milland, as his younger brothers, give top-notch support. Here is a band of brothers to be reckoned with.But it is the villains who really steal the show. Brian Donlevy is unforgettable as Sergeant Markoff, a sadist from the lowest depths of hell. To watch him drive the defense of his outpost, using the living &amp; the dead, is to see a man driven mad by the evil chewing away at his very soul.J. Carrol Naish is equally memorable as Rasinoff the rat. A little man used to lies &amp; thievery, he becomes the natural toady for Markoff. When his fear finally drives him insane atop the watch tower, and he begins to cackle like a beast, it is a horrible sound to hear.Broderick Crawford appears as a cowboy turned legionnaire. Albert Dekker is formidable as a mutinous soldier. Adolescent Donald O'Connor plays young Beau.Director William Wellman gave the film fine atmospherics. Who can forget, in the very first sequence, the quiet ride up to eerie Fort Zinderneuf, manned by its unblinking sentries? The flashback scenes are rather tedious, but when the plot returns to the desert, there's adventure enough for the most jaded viewer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How different adventure movies from in the 1930s are from their counterparts today. Honor, loyalty, bravery, sacrifice...what concepts! Beau Geste has them all in spades.A very interesting story, this movie is as much a mystery as adventure story. It spans 15 years, following three adopted brothers from their childhood in an English manor house to their membership in the French Foreign Legion and their stationing at a fort in the remote reaches of the Sahara.If you are tired of the paperthin, hole-ridden plots of today's action movies that rely on CGI and special effects instead of story, then this movie is for you!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In The French Foreign Legion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It gets off to a great start ... as a mystery. A relief cavalry approaches a Saharan desert outpost called Fort Zinderneuf, enclosed on all four sides. A cursory investigation from the outside indicates that all the soldiers at the fort are dead, propped up like mannequins with guns in their hands as if prepared to shoot. Then, without warning, two shots are fired at the arriving cavalry from inside the fort. The head of the relief cavalry sends a soldier in to investigate, but he disappears. When the relief cavalry moves inside the fort, a note is found on the body of one of the dead soldiers. The note is a confession of theft of a high-priced sapphire."Beau Geste" is a rousing adventure story of three brothers who start out as close-nit siblings in a privileged English household, and end up as adults in North Africa, as part of the French Foreign Legion.The plot structure is mostly one long flashback. After the opening mystery, the plot reverts back fifteen years to when the three brothers were kids, with dreams of being in the military. The plot then progresses forward to reveal their actions that led ultimately to the film's opening mystery.The plot is okay but a tad weak in the middle Act. Too much emphasis is placed on the sadistic Sgt. Markoff (Brian Donlevy), leader of Fort Zinderneuf. He overshadows the three brothers, and is thus somewhat distracting.The film's B&amp;W visuals are quite good. Yet, this is one film I would like to have seen in color. All that sand and the emptiness of the desert contrasts nicely with the staid, claustrophobic Victorian interiors the three brothers grew up in.Acting is acceptable overall. But Gary Cooper is miscast in the lead role. He looks too old to play Beau. And his acting is rather wooden. I would have preferred a younger, perhaps less well-known actor.Background music is wasted. It's too nondescript to contribute any emotional tone to the story, and it is at times manipulative.Overall, "Beau Geste" is an engaging adventure story, with themes of loyalty, bravery, and honor. Despite some minor irritations, it's a well-constructed, highly credible film, one that is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Adventure - Dated Geopolitics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The film gets high kudos for being well directed, well acted, and well produced. It is one of the great films of 1939 that remains entertaining nearly seventy years later. But like that other classic GONE WITH THE WIND the racism in the background is amazing.Percival Wren's novels are not readily available today, although back in 1971 I was amazed to see them on the shelf of my high school library. Wren, growing up in the late 19th Century, was growing up in an age of hyper - nationalism, and imperialism. So when he writes, the negative stereotypes of third world types (and of peoples of other European countries) come out. In this case, the Arabs are the evil villains. That the French are invading their land is not dealt with. The odd thing is that the author was British, and he could (if he wanted to) have made the French less likable, but that did not happen. To Wren, British character was the top of the line, and French not far behind it. But Arab was at the bottom (in some of his books Jews do not come out too well either, but that is not apparent in this film).He's lifted some of the plot line from Wilkie Collins' THE MOONSTONE, as the plot is about the theft of a very valuable jewel, and how the "Geste" brothers (Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, and Robert Preston) leave England in disgrace and join the French Foreign Legion to make amend for their apparent theft of the jewel, leaving Heather Thatcher (Lady Isobel - their guardian) and Susan Hayward (Isobel - Ray Milland's sweetheart) and James Stephenson (Major Henri De Beaujolais - their friend since childhood) shocked. Only their old childhood nemesis, G.P.Huntley (Augustus "Sir Mordred") is glad to see the thieves go.Question might arise - why join the French Foreign Legion? Well, if they joined the British army or navy, after confessing the theft, they could have been brought back for trial. They could have crossed the Atlantic and joined the American cavalry out west (there are cases like that), but they choose the Foreign Legion as Major De Beaujolais has always told them stories about it.So they go to North Africa and sign up. It is a harsh life as a mercenary, in one of the all-time hardest fighting units in military history. The Foreign Legion is usually associated with fighting the Riffs and Tuaregs of North Africa (particularly with books or films like this). They also fought in Mexico (in the 1860s) to prop up Emperor Maximilian, in Southeast Asia (Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam) in the 19th and 20th Centuries, and are still in use today. But here they are used for policing purposes: they are to put down revolts by the natives who won't give up their rights to rule themselves. They are actually fighting the grandfathers of the men who reclaimed Morocco, Algeria, and Tunisia in the 20th Century.Cooper, Milland, and Preston soon meet the men they fight alongside with: Broderick Crawford, Albert Dekker, and J. Carroll Naish. This is one film with a great cast of character actors. As was pointed out on another comment it is the character actors who make this film live. Naish as the hyena-like Razomov, who makes himself too useful to the villain of the piece (the unscrupulous Sgt. Markov - Brian Donleavy) gave one of the best performances in his career. Same with Donleavy, who is a real bastard but also a great fighter. Watch as Donleavy keeps figuring out ways to fool the enemy such as propping up dead bodies on the roof of the fort, or having the men laugh to suggest there are more men in the fort than they think. Yet for all of the clever tricks, it's a lucky shot killing the head of the attacking forces that ends the siege.If this film were made today, we would get to know the personalities of the Arabs. It would be a more complex tale. But the complexities of the story are enough as is. Why do men willingly go into danger to prove themselves? Why do they act in negative ways, surprising and hurting those who love them? And what are the secrets that we carry with us that we try never to reveal. That is at the heart of BEAU GESTE and it's characters, and of the Foreign Legion it glorified.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful adventure yarn, I promise you!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this back in the '60's when little, seen it umpteen times by now over the decades and still love it. The classic first novel of the Beau trilogy by P. C. Wren was an excellent read ("the mystery and adventure story of a generation" first published in 1924), but both the 1926 and 1939 films were special too and each added something of their own to the tale while staying as faithful as possible. It was perhaps also the first time I understood and appreciated the purpose of a flashback, with the grim opening fully explained by the logical ending.In the desert a Foreign Legion relief troop comes across Fort Zinderneuf being defended from the native Touaregs by seemingly motionless legionnaires. Previously in England a sapphire worth GBP 30,000 is stolen seemingly by one of the three inseparable Geste brothers played by Cooper, Preston and Milland ? who escape possible retribution by joining the Legion. There they and the rest of the troop become soldiers under the "trifle uncouth" leadership of Sgt Markoff played by Donlevy. It's a fabulous story fabulously played and fabulously produced, rich in adventure, emotion and good old fashioned honour, duty, devotion and courage. Everyone ? and I mean everyone in the marvellous cast gives one of the best performances of their careers; watching this it's even hard to recall some of the clinkers Milland was involved with when he was older! There's so many memorable bits, from the naval battle when they were children to Rasinoff laughing like a mirthless hyena in the tower at Zinderneuf; the funeral promise movingly fulfilled; but especially cinematic was the rolling and running down the sand dune sequence by Preston and Milland.One of my all time favourites: it's Art, utterly gorgeous in its bright black and white. But it's always seemed to me that the major Hollywood studios had to try very hard to produce a film that was less than very good in 1939; it wasn't quite the same after that wonder year. However, the future onslaughts of TV and rock &amp; roll would have curtailed the making of routinely decent movies like this anyway. This is an entertainment classic that even though probably now incomprehensible in its mores to many people will outlast the many already incomprehensible films made today such as Man Of Steel. Give me Men Of Gold any day.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over long adventure with stars too old for their parts</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The tale of the Geste brothers, one of whom is a jewel thief, all of which run off to join the Foreign Legion is considered an adventure classic. This version of the film is held up as one of the many films that makes 1939 the best year there ever was in the movies.As for me, tonight was the first time I was really seeing the film from start to finish (I don't think I'd ever seen any version of the story before other than Marty Feldman's Last remake). I had seen bits and pieces but never the whole thing. My reaction to seeing it is one of disappointment. Its a long rambling story with some great action, some wonderful lines, and allure that completely alludes me. Not a bad film, I just don't get it.Yes I know what happens but why is this hailed as something so great? I don't know. The cast Gary Cooper, Robert Preston, Ray Milland, and others are very good. except that with the exception of Robert Preston, everyone is at least 10 to 15 years too old (Beau is suppose to be 27 when the events take place Cooper was almost 40). For me I was watching lets pretend and not a real story.I know I'm a party pooper but the film never got beyond okay, and I really wanted to reach for the remote on more than one occasion, though I didn't.6 out of 10. Worth a look on a slow night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Opening scene. Turn of the century Sahara. A long line of French troops approach one of their isolated fortresses. The tricolor still flies, though the bugle calls get no answer. The French captain enters and finds the embrasures manned with armed dead men. Not a soul is left alive.Lots of excitement in this story of three upper-class English brothers -- Cooper, Milland, and Preston -- two of whom die heroic deaths in the French Foreign Legion in the African desert. There was a time when everyone talked about joining the Foreign Legion to forget. The film makes clear that there must be far easier ways to forget than joining an army of stumble bums commanded by sadists.The three brothers grow up happily together. (Donald O'Connor is the young Gary Cooper.) Not a care in the world until some tomfoolery about a stolen emerald leads them to take off for exotic climes.They're stationed at a remote fort that is surrounded by hostile Tuareg tribesmen. The lieutenant in charge is stern but fair. But he dies and the sergeant takes over. In a nicely directed scene, by William Wellman, the lieutenant gasps out his last breath in the presence of the sergeant, Brian Donlevy. Donlevy, like Captain Bligh, is a splendid soldier but has a hellish disposition. He stares at the recently expired body, leans over it, presses his ear to the lieutenant's chest, and in a close up, a fiendish grin of satisfaction informs his features.And what a bastard he is. He calls his men "scum," "pigs", and "my children," which must be mes enfants in his language. He relishes dealing out punishment, always operating more or less within the rules but pushing the envelope. He lives only for the army and for promotion. His goal? To become an officer and be awarded the Legion of Honor. He doesn't quite make it.The three happy brothers are just that -- playing jokes on one another, clapping each other on the back, waving and smiling even as they're about to be swept away on the very stream of time. Sort of dull.But Brian Donlevy's sergeant is a much more complex and interesting character. The actor himself was quite a guy, pursuing Pancho Villa into Mexico under General Pershing, then the army in France, the Lafayette Escadrille, and a couple of years at Annapolis, before becoming an actor. He was usually a restrained mid-executive type. But here he reaches for the stars and turns in a very spirited performance.Make up helped a lot. His bullish neck is encase in a tight uniform collar so it bulges over the edges. His haircut is abominable. And he has a discrete but nifty scar all the way down his cheek, suggestive of a combative past. In fact, make up is good all the way around. It's turned the curly haired, Italianate J. Carrol Naish into a whiny little Russian babushka.It's slow getting started. We know how playful and loyal the brothers are, long before they run off to join the Foreign Legion. But once it achieves flight speed, it's highly enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Though Gary Cooper and the rest of the adult cast are fine in Beau Geste, it was mainly my interest in Donald O'Connor that finally got me to see this</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having heard about this movie for the last 30 years, I finally got around to watching this on DVD that I borrowed from the library. The main reason I'm watching this now is because I've been on a hook to watch various of Donald O'Connor's movies in chronological order, what I can find of them anyway. So when I found out he's in this one as Gary Cooper's character's younger self, I knew I had to watch this one pronto! Anyway, he appears with his co-star from Tom Sawyer, Detective-Billy Cook. With them are two kid stars from 1938's The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (made by Selznick, not Paramount which made the TSD movie as well as the one I'm now reviewing)-David Holt and Ann Gillis. Their scenes were fun to watch which extended when we first watch some of them as adults when portrayed by Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, Robert Preston, and Susan Hayward-before she became a leading star herself. By the time those men-who are brothers in the film-join the Foreign Legion, there's some great drama concerning them and their encounter with their sadistic sergeant played perfectly by Brian Donlevy. There's more but I think I'll just stop there and just say I highly recommend this version of Beau Geste.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning, the title of "Beau Geste" appears for a brief moment elusively in dunes of wind and dust. After this the viewer follows a French platoon discovering a deserted fortress all of whose guards are armed but dead. The incomprehensible mindlessness of war is drawn with simple crude strokes, leaving the audience gasp of astonishment. Taking a few steps back to shed light on the beginning, the film tells the story of three brothers who join the foreign league. During their service they come across with a cruel general, Arabic rebels and moral that is highly questionable. "Beau Geste" is really a basic classic of adventure film but also one of William A. Wellman's highest achievements. In the film, Wellman draws grand yet personal -- both individual and social -- lines of war and misery in a reduced fashion. After WWII he continued such depiction in "Story of G.I. Joe" which immersed deeper into the inhumane world of war. Although "Beau Geste" is very clear in means of narrative, it also features profoundly intense emotional depth. It has a severe tragic undertone but, at the same, it's filled with romantic and even comic moments. There is one gentle scene between two brothers, who rest for a while under attack in the zone between life and death, which particularly gave me the impression of this being an utterly moving film. I must confess that I wasn't expecting much of "Beau Geste" on the account of unfair factors that normally don't affect me when it comes to my viewing habits. Therefore, I apologize and recommend this film even to those who aren't interested. All in all, "Beau Geste" grows out to be a beautiful tale of brotherly love, enhancing the importance of fraternity. It is truly a film to remember.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this, quite literally, "Boy's Own" adventure of three brothers' lifelong devotion and appetite for adventure. I liked so much about it and also found it well constructed with its clever play on "circular time" where the mystery of the apparently lifeless fort at the beginning is cleverly cleared up and the touching "Viking funeral" afforded Beau by his grieving brother and the neat way the secret of the missing diamond was resolved too.In between, there was strong characterisation (although I was disappointed not to see a re-appearance by the boys' childhood pet hate, Gussie, before the end) some good action scenes and fine cinematography in recreating the vastness of the desert and the wretched conditions the Legionnaires had to endure. I may be seeing something that wasn't there but with the death of Digby, I was strongly reminded of the famous and then recent picture by Robert Capa of the death of a soldier in the Spanish Civil War.Best of all though, was the marvellous acting, not just Cooper in one of his archetypal strong silent types, with a hint of gaucheness, naturally, but also Preston and Milland as his gallant, supportive brothers and especially Brian Dunlevy as the sadistic Sergeant Markoff.1939 in hindsight has been considered an "annus mirabilis" for Hollywood productions, with so many wonderful films turned out that year from "Gone With The Wind" on down. "Beau Geste" seems to me to be among the best of the very best and as good an adventure film as you could hope to see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A childhood pleasure, an adult jewel.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night, upon receiving a mail order, borderline watchable DVD, I played the silent version of Beau Geste starring Ronald Colman. The 1939 version is not a scene-by-scene remake, but it is darn close. Where there are notable differences they are for the better. But I heartily recommend the 1926 film to those who love the Cooper-Milland-Donleavy version and are willing to pay for a crappy transfer. (Why there are so many great movies that have never been released in a cleaned-up DVD version beats me).I'll blame shelling out for a sub-par, silent version on my dad. I was blessed to have a father who loved movies. Dad's gone now. But his encouragement and never-ending desire to turn me on to the films he loved as a kid lives on in me. So many great movies together on the couch in the era of four channel television.Some of dad's favorites, "The Thief of Bagdad," "Trail of the Lonesome Pine," "Gunga Din," and "Lives of a Bengal Lancer" to name a few, are now my own. As for "Beau Geste," I've lost count of how many times I have watched it. I seem to recall my first viewing. The set of foreign legion toy soldiers that followed. My pal next door had a sand box. Soon we were building our own Fort Zinderneuf and waging mock battles.Sappy, huh. Well that's okay. It's hard to embrace old movies without a little sap. But there's more to it than just nostalgia. As a child, I loved this movie for the adventure, the action, and what may be the most drop-dead eerie beginning in film history. Fifty years later, the love between brothers (I have three), between an adoptive parent and her children,and between lovers separated by time, distance, and moral dilemma are new reasons I will be screening the 1939 version this evening (not to mention one of the most odious screen villains).There will be several times when I "well up." The opening quote from Kayam (or the Koran) is a slam dunk. The first viking funeral not so much, though it use to tear me up as a child. The death of Beau. The second death second funeral, and the reading of his letter.If you've made it this far without an insulin shot, and are under the age of forty, I challenge you to come up with films made since 1980 that you feel will have this kind of hold on you when you're sixty. If you're having trouble thinking of any, I suggest you investigate some of the classics of the '30's and '40's. Hell, even a silent flick or two. How else are you going to pass the lasting beauty of film down to your children? Some closing observations in comparing the silent version and first remake of "Beau Geste:" (1) Wow what a difference a soundtrack makes! I'm talking orchestration not dialogue, the silent DVD version I now own having a typical, and possibly original, score. I can hear that awesomely spooky and provocative music from the '39 film and I have yet to put the DVD in! Then again, think of your favorite films, then try to identify one with a score you don't find incredible! 2) Watching Ronald Colman act, I started to believe I was actually hearing him! Kinda like a foreign language film where halfway in you think you now know the language. That remarkable "Prisoner of Zenda" voice spoke to me. But had I not known Colman, would his performance have seemed so powerful? I'll never know.(3) Victor McLaglen plays one of the American legionnaires. Small role notwithstanding, I kept seeing him as one of the sergeants in "Gunga Din." Same mischievous grin and infectious laughter you could only imagine. Same happy-go-lucky Irishman though younger and thinner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Three brothers join the Foreign Legion following the mysterious disappearance of a valuable sapphire.This movie came out the same year (1939) as that other masterpiece of colonial adventure, The Four Feathers. Both make first-rate use of family bonds and family honor to create a strong emotional context to all the colorful combat. Those bonds really work here, establishing a strong sense of one for all and all for one. Plus the fact that the brothers have been adopted by the kindly Lady Brandon (Thatcher) not only lends poignancy, but makes the central twist work really well.As good as Cooper-Milland-Foster are, it's really Donlevy's movie. His cruel martinet has stayed with me over the decades?the military haircut, the perfectly squared shoulders, the command voice. He not only commands his legionnaires, he commands the movie, as well. And, when he falls, I still have mixed emotions, despite his many acts of cruelty. It's a crackling good story, but it's his imposing presence that makes the adventure memorable. No wonder Donlevy was Oscar-nominated, a near-perfect blend of character and actor.Two minor reservations. Cooper's fine in Beau's role, more animated than usual. However, at nearly forty, he appears a shade too old for the youthful part. Also, I've never been able to reconcile to the relative ease with which the mutiny is put down. There's like five guys with guns facing a hundred guys who stand to be executed for their planned mutiny, yet they meekly give up, especially after Schwartz (the great Albert Dekker) has so powerfully roused them to action. To me, director Wellman's staging here is less than convincing.Nonetheless, the mix of mystery, emotion and action remains superbly entertaining, and is ironically, one of the few movies that actually lives up to its title.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>from the magic year of 1939</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Told many times, this version of "Beau Geste" stars Gary Cooper in the title role, and Ray Milland and Robert Preston as his brothers. The three boys live in the home of Lady Brandon, who has adopted them. Lady Brandon is the owner of the famous "Blue Water" sapphire. Because of tight money, however, it has to be sold. Lady Brandon brings out the sapphire for a final look by the family, the lights go off, and when they go back on, the sapphire is gone. Beau admits to stealing it to his brothers, and in turn, Digby and John confess, leaving us not knowing what the story is. The three brothers join the Foreign Legion and are under the command of the cruel, sadistic Sgr. Markoff (Brian Donlevy). Eventually John (Robert Preston) is separated from the other two. The film starts with John and the troop he is in coming upon Fort Zinderneuf, where everyone is dead. It then flashes back to 15 years earlier, and we learn about the boys' camaraderie, Digby's (Ray Milland) love for Lady Brandon's ward Isobel (Susan Hayward), and the battle games they played as children.Briskly directed by William Wellman, "Beau Geste" is a great adventure, a neat mystery, and a heartwarming story filled with wonderful performances. Gary Cooper is at the peak of his handsomeness and brings humor to the brave Beau, and Ray Milland does well as the one with the romance. Robert Preston in those days was not a great movie star, though he is excellent as John. His major coups would be on the stage, and it was in his role as Henry Hill in the Music Man, which he brought to film, that would much later make him a true star. Here he doesn't have a chance to shine until the end of the film. Susan Hayward is very sweet in what would prove to be an unusual type of role for her - just a few years later, she would be playing the other woman, and later than that, the tough, emotional one.Beautifully done, with some amazing desert shots, "Beau Geste" is a film that again demonstrates the "magic" of 1939.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remarkable film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One way that I personally know this is a really good film is because I expected not to like and probably turn it off after the first 15 minutes. Instead I was glued to the screen! I thought I wouldn't like the film because I expected it to be along the lines of "Gunga Din". But in the early scenes of the film you realize it's really a mystery about a stolen sapphire (great early scene in the secret crypt). Not just another film of men trudging through the desert fighting Arabs (although there is that, too, although not until well into the second half of the film, and then only to advance the plot surrounding the mystery).But even before you realize the mystery surrounding the gem, there's the opening mystery of why the French Foreign Legion fort is deserted, except for all its dead soldiers. Spooky! And answered so well at the close of the film.The early scenes when the main characters are children are delightful, and it's particularly interesting to see Donald O'Connor as one of the boys -- Beau. Much to my surprise, it was his 9th film! As the kids mature they turn into Gary Cooper, Susan Hayward, Ray Milland, and Robert Preston, and then the family gem is stolen and one of the boys appears to be the thief...so off the 3 boys go to the French Foreign Legion to hide and attempt to figure out which one of them has the jewel.Once in the Foreign Legion they meet up with all sorts, including a very odd American cowboy -- Broderick Crawford! Brian Donlevy, as the sergeant doesn't seem quite so bad at the beginning, but becomes increasingly sadistic as the film went on (and received an Academy Award nomination for his performance).The closing scenes of the movie, beginning with the attack by the Arabs, are quite remarkable -- among the best I've seen in any movie. The attack scenes in the desert are stunning...not always easy to say for black and white. The scene where Gary Cooper dies and is cremated...remarkable. And the way the film comes to a conclusion is quite unique.However, beyond the action of the film, this movie has real depth. It is as much a psychological drama as it is an action flick. You just have to focus on the drama of what must have been an almost untenable life.A wonderful film from that remarkable year 1939.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First for the view: This 1939 black and white adventure yarn, not nominated for best picture (GONE WITH THE WIND and some flying monkeys beat it out) covers a type of warfare somewhat less epic than that hovering over the horizon of GWTW. Muslim tacticians throw somewhat predictable hordes of horse-mounted riflemen against a fort the French have built in a misguided attempt to babysit a northern African population estimated at 20 million more than a century ago. With a stolen valuable and a sadistic sergeant playing a big part in the plot, this film combines elements which would later carry movies such as FORT APACHE, THE MALTESE FALCON, and Marlon Brando's MUTINY ON THE BOUNTY by themselves. With an extended prologue featuring some of the lead characters as children providing background for later events, and a couple postscripts (the first of which is totally unnecessary and counter-productive), it is hard to rate this remake any higher than 8 of 10.Now, for the gist of the jest, with just a kernel of truth: It is too bad BEAU GESTE costumer Edith Head was not allowed to provide technicolor hoop skirts such as those seen in GWTW or Anna's THE KING AND I outfits to Isobel and perhaps a few other gratuitous females in an added ball scene. The producers still could have filmed on the cheap by pulling a reverse WIZARD OF OZ (which, oddly enough, also was nominated for Best Picture in '39); that is, instead of having just a few minutes in black &amp; white at the beginning and end per OZ, GESTE could have bracketed its desert gray-scale middle with color.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rousing adventure...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It is an amazing testament to the power of the 1939 offerings from Hollywood that a film as superb as "Beau Geste" could not be considered one of the very top offerings of the year! But, with films like "Gone With the Wind", "Goodbye, Mr. Chips" and "Mr. Smith Goes to Washington" you can perhaps understand why. It was a very, very tough year to get noticed and if I named all the great films of this year, I'd have quite a few more to add! This tale begins in a wealthy home where three brothers are inseparable and lovers of adventure. However, when they are older, a crisis strikes when it appears that one of them has stolen an incredibly valuable jewel that belongs to the family. In reaction to this, each of the three runs off to join the Foreign Legion--hoping that they can take blame for the theft and allow the others to preserve their honor. However, it turns out all three have joined separately and just happen to be stationed in the same place (yes, I know this is practically impossible). They don't realize, however, that the Legion is not all it's cracked up to be--thanks to a sadistic Sergeant who takes pleasure in making his troops miserable and on the verge of mutiny. In the end, you learn the secret--one which one of the brothers kept from everyone until after his death.This movie has it all--a great cast (with Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston), a wonderful script and a great desert location shoot. I would say that it's a bit better than another great and similar adventure tale, "Gunga Din"--also from 1939!! And, just for fun, here are a few other films from this amazing year: "The Wizard of Oz", "Stagecoach", "Midnight", "Ninotchka" and "The Women"! By the way, when you watch this film, note the chubby guy with a beard and pipe when he dies. The sadistic Sergeant (Brian Donlevy--in his best role of his career) props the dead guy up to make it look like he's alive. Look closely--he's obviously breathing! Also, a moment later in a scene that is NOT a mistake, watch as one of the dying guy goes into spasms. This is pretty cool--something you don't see in films very often.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Who Stole The Blue Water?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this Old Chestnut, as they refer to old entertainment, several times. This is a terrific picture that gets better with the passage of time - mainly because it's a great movie and also because they don't make 'em like this anymore.Whatever happened to Hollywood? Can't they make a picture for adults anymore? I don't mean X types, I mean with a plot for grownups. The plot of 'Beau Geste' has been synopsized by many reviewers and needs no further rehash, but it is a classic example of "escapist entertainment" prevalent in the late 30's in which you can put your mind in neutral and just go with the storyline, however illogical. It works here. The three leads, Cooper, Milland and Preston, play off each other extremely well, and the part of Markoff had to have been Brian Donlevy's best role - never cared for him very much.I never took a film course - I just know what I like, as Justice Stewart once said. I know what movies are good...and the thief of the Blue Water is beside the point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The First Remake of "Beau Geste"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The addition of sound, and a sharper focus, only serves to make this version of "Beau Geste" (1926) seem older, and less European; specifically, the lack of consideration for the change in technology, from silent to sound, does not make this an improvement over the original silent film. And, the ages in the cast do not add up. Still, it's a good adventure story, and a fine Hollywood production. Despite showing the obvious "generation gap", Gary Cooper (Beau), Ray Milland (John), Robert Preston (Digby) are valiant as the brothers Geste, who join the French Foreign Legion for honor and gratitude.Brian Donlevy's sadistic "Sergeant Markov" (nee "Lejaune"), who promises his men, "I make soldiers out of scum like you and I don't do it gently!" was duly nominated for a "Best Supporting Actor" Oscar. A future nominated J. Carrol Naish (as Rasinoff) is also quite nasty. Donald O'Connor (young Beau) and the opening segments help get the film off to a great start. You'll have to decide whether or not the film proves the Arabian proverb: "The love of a man for a woman waxes and wanes like the moon, but the love of brother for brother is steadfast as the stars and endures like the word of the prophet." ******* Beau Geste (8/2/39) William A.

		<fullReview>Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston play three orphaned brothers who are raised at Brandon Abbas by their aunt Lady Patricia Brandon. When money troubles hit the household, attention focuses on the Blue Water Sapphire, the last remaining wealth in the Brandon estate. The sapphire disappears and is thought to have been stolen, fleeing the scandal, the brothers follow each other into the Foreign Legion, where at Fort Zinderneuf they encounter sadistic Sgt. Markoff and face a test of their respective courage, honour and loyalty.Beau Geste is a truly classic picture, directed by the highly talented William A Wellman, it combines all the elements needed to entertain across the board. Heroes and villains, battles ahoy, potential mutiny and a mystery at its heart, all combine here to flesh out a ripper of an adventure picture. The actors all perform excellently, with a special mention for Brian Donlevy as the nasty Markoff, it's a truly frightening and bully like characterisation, while a nod of approval goes to Susan Hayward appearing in one of her first pictures. The art direction from Hans Dreier &amp; Robert Odell was rightly nominated for an academy award and Alfred Newman's score flows seamlessly within the film's fluctuating story.So many wonderful scenes to enjoy here, watching the boys {and girl} as children playing Admirals is just wonderful, and sets us up a treat for the films emotive last reel; it's a masterstroke of story telling to observe the innocence of youth surrounded by staunch loyalty. Then there are all the sequences at Fort Zinderneuf, where the boys are now men of stature, but still they have that mystery in their past to carry around with them, this makes for an involving viewing as the tests are thrown at them. As this is 1939 the film fails to give us any insight as to why the enemy is the enemy, the Tuaregs are merely the aggressors of the piece, but to over analyse and be critical there would be churlish. For Beau Geste is something of an action adventure leading light, it is in fact, a Beautiful Gesture indeed. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on P.C. Wren's novel and a remake of the 1926 film tells the story of three brothers, loyal to each other, but one of whom swiped a fabulous family treasure, who enlist in the foreign legion to save the face of the family name as well as each other. They may have decided otherwise when they encounter a brutal sadistic sergeant and a murderous desert tribe attacking the post. The film succeeds in every way with great performances by leads Cooper ( who was a bit miscast here but makes up for it ), Preston, and Milland. Donlevy earns his best supporting actor nod here by stealing every scene he's in as the sergeant ( especially during the battle scenes ). Naish is also quite effective as the informer. Hayward's role in the film is miniscule and wasted. The setup of the film is also brilliant setting itself as a mystery/adventure epic. Don't miss this one. Rating, 10 out of 10.</fullReview>

The author of the book actually served in the French foreign legion, and he knew a lot about it.

		<shortDescription>An Action Adventure with Shades of WWII Already in It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The year was 1939, and the world seemed to be cloaked in an overwhelming sense of dread. After the failure to stop Germany's annexation of the Sudetenland and the consequent military buildup, everyone from France to the United Kingdom to the United States was nervous about Adolf Hitler's machinations in central Europe. Allied reaction to the looming Wehrmacht is expressed in the films each country produced at the time. The French produced what is arguably their greatest cinematic achievement, Jean Renoir's The Rules of the Game (1939) a complex and bitter tragic-comedy about an aristocracy blissfully unaware of their own impracticality. The United Kingdom released the ostentatious British-Empire film Four Feathers (1939) and the thriller The Spy is Black (1939) both typifying the trappings of their genre but still fatalistic in theme. Finally there was the United States famous around the world for two things, Hollywood glitz and rebellious bluster; to that end Gone with the Wind (1939) satisfied both criteria to become the most popular film ever.Beau Geste pre-dates Casablanca's (1942) coalition building tale of an American helping European refugees in Vichy France. Beau Geste is the story of three English brothers who join the French Foreign Legion played predominately by Americans and produced by an American studio. The three brothers Beau (Cooper), Digby (Preston) and John (Milland) are adopted by the Brandon Abbas estate headed by lady of the house aunt Brandon (Thatcher). The estate is secured by the possession of "The Blue Water" a supposedly cursed diamond that the never seen patriarch is anxious to sell. The diamond disappears promptly followed by Beau then Digby then John. Both Beau and Digby have left confessions of the theft. While in the Foreign Legion, the brothers are separated in North Africa, John becoming a cavalryman while Beau and Digby remain under the abusive thumb of Sergeant Markoff (Donlevy) at Fort Zinderneuf.In some ways Beau Geste acts like a white man's burden, Christianize Africa, make way for progress, British-Empire film with the appealing call for adventure and the hordes of nameless "savages". Yet there is no talk of colonialism and its supposed good. The novel originally written by P.C. Wren borrowed the title from "Chanson de geste" a genre of medieval French poetry literally translated to "song of good gesture". This manner of poetry celebrated grand adventures and the value of the group or the stock over the individual of romantic poems. They also tended to be epic, bittersweet and cyclical. Beau Geste definitely accentuates the theme of brotherhood, chivalry and good gesture but also hints that that may not be enough.The foil to the brothers is Sergeant Markoff, a Russian born former criminal made cruel by Siberian prisons. This worthy adversary along with fellow Russian Rasinoff (Naish) find out about the diamond and try to betray the brothers much like Russia would betray the Allies with the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact. Yet while he's duplicitous and a tyrant Markoff proves resourceful in battle and practical immediately following a mutiny. After every attack wave of nameless, faceless Arabs, Markoff takes the dead soldiers and props them up on the Fort's embrasures and insists the bugle be played to intimidate the enemy. His resourcefulness is hard won unlike the brothers; at an early point Markoff examines John's hands and states "never done a days work in your life have you?"Yet every important figure in the film comes to realize everyone has their reasons for fighting, none of which will suffice alone. Beau fights for glory, Digby fights for his brothers, John fights to see the lovely Isobel (Hayward) again and Markoff fights because he craves power and control. There are also two Americans in the mix Hank (Crawford) and Buddy (Barton) both of which are hobos who join the French Foreign Legion simply because it provides three square meals a day. There's a moment before the infamous Fort Zinderneuf mutiny where Beau remains loyal to Markoff out of a sense of allegiance to the French Flag. It's a poignant and old-fashioned scene which unlike the rest of the film rings hollow. Is it hollow because on the eve of World War people felt jaded about Nationalism and director William A. Wellman knew it? Did he want to subtly critique the duty-bound works of Rudyard Kipling and H. Rider Haggard? Or does it seem hollow because I, as a contemporary audience member am unable to fully grasp the context?Beau Geste was released in August of 1939. By September, Germany invaded Poland thus stoking the fire of what would eventually become WWII. In the years before the United States entered the war, there were plenty of films that tried the coax the populous into supporting intervention, most made by European refugees. You had Hitchcock's Foreign Correspondent (1940), Wyler's Mrs. Miniver (1942) and Lang's Man Hunt (1941) as well as the aforementioned Casablanca which began production days before the Japanese bombardment of Pearl Harbor. While many of these films remain well known to this day Beau Geste has fallen by the wayside despite the presence of Hollywood superstar Gary Cooper. It's a shame too because this film is not only an adventurous row but a bittersweet goodbye to a standard of fortitude gone by. An excellent companion piece to The Life and Death of Colonel Blimp (1943), Beau Geste should be rediscovered by all.</fullReview>

They're running from a family scandal of the theft of a missing 'Bue Water' sapphire. But their troubles are overshadowed in the burning Sahara desert under the tyranny of a sadistic sergeant and defending a desert fort from the native uprising Arab riflemen.*Special Stars- Gary Cooper, Ray Millard, Robert Preston, Brian Donlevy, J. Carrol Nash, Broderick Crawford.*Theme- Family is all important.*Trivia/location/goofs- B &amp; W. One of the most remade film stories/plots in film history. Fort was in Yuma, AZ. The French flag is flying before a soldier is ordered to climb the tower to put it up. Several University of San Deigo students discovered the Location of the fort and then shot their own version of Beau Geste in the 40s.*Emotion- This is the best and most memorable version of the Beau Geste script. The wonderfully casted and acted lead roles make this film the hallmark of how the other remakes are judged. A gem of an entertaining and dramatic film that everyone should see at least once.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1939 version of "Beau Geste" remains the ultimate Foreign Legion movie. That's hardly surprising considering the fact that the director, William Wellman, was himself a Legionaire. "Wild Bill" Wellman didn't become a move director by studying at film school, he began as extra and stunt man during the 1920s. Prior to that he served as a fighter pilot in the French Air Service, during World War I, as a member of the famous Lafayette flying Corps. Like all the other Americans serving in the Lafayette, Wellman entered the French Air Service via the Foreign Legion.Like "The Four Feathers", "Beau Geste" is based on a novel written at the turn of the last century. The world was a very different place then, so some aspects of the story might seem somewhat less than politically correct today. If they did a remake of "Beau Geste" today they would undoubtedly add entirely new sub-plots in an effort to make it more politically correct. In fact, that's exactly what they did do in the 2002 re-make of "The Four Feathers". Needless to say, the result was no improvement over Alexander Korda's spectacular 1939 version of "The Four Feathers". By the same token, it is doubtful that any similar meddling with the plot of "Beau Geste" could possible produce any improvement over Wellman's fabulous 1939 version. "Beau Geste" is a perfect example of how the old Hollywood studio system was able to combine the right material with the right cast and the right director to achieve a level of film making almost impossible to reproduce today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The best Geste and then some.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Gary Cooper, Ray Milland and Robert Preston are brothers who run off and join the foreign legion in order to preserve the honor of the family name in this classic romantic adventure. P.C. Wren's novel about honor, courage and Viking funerals gets its best treatment (there have been three)under the knowledgeable direction of William Wellman the performances of the the leads and an effective supporting cast.After a family scandal involving a stolen gem surfaces the brothers Geste make themselves scarce by entering the French Foreign Legion. Two of the brothers end up at Fort Zinderneuf, a besieged desert outpost run by a martinet sergeant. When the third brother arrives the rumor that one holds the precious gem gets back to Sgt.Markoff who makes plans to extract it from them. Meanwhile inside the walls he sadistically drives his men while marauding Arab Taurogs pose a huge threat outside the walls. The troops mutiny but must quickly turn to defending Zinderneuf when the Taurogs lay siege to Zinderneuf.With two plots driving the story Beau Geste moves along at a steady suspenseful pace after it's rather slow nebulous opening that nevertheless sets the stage for the rousing action and drama ahead. As the title character Gary Cooper might be a tad old to play the youthful idealist but he makes up for it in nobility and courage while remaining stoically conflicted by what Markoff is and represents. Brian Donlevy's Markoff is one of film history's great villains. Both corrupt and courageous he may lust after the gem but it is tenacity and leadership that saves the fort from being overrun. J.Carrol Naish as the craven Rasinoff also registers in a supporting role.The Fort Zinderneuf setting amid the blowing dunes of the desert makes for a dramatic atmosphere that Wellman and his cameraman utilize to full effect. Alfred Newman also adds accent to the dessert's mood and mystery with a score that partners perfectly to the isolation as well as the action and bonding of the brothers.Nearly half a century ago as a child I was mesmerized by this film. While that may no longer be the case, it still stands on its own as an excellent adventure film that can be enjoyed by children of all ages.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was eleven and I loved it from the start till the end. The story is about three brothers who go and join the Foreign Legion. Their commanding officer,Sergent Markoff (Brian Donlevy) is the villan and Susan Hayward is the beaty in this big screen adaption of P.C. Wren's novel. Also stars J. Carol Nash, Albert Decker, Broderick Crawford and Donald O'Connor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Every man does his duty at Zinderneuf - dead or alive!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beau Geste presents a magnificent based-on-novel re-telling of one of the greatest stories ever told. Three brothers embody the ideal reservoir of human resource and comraderie as they travel together from England to the battlefields of the French Foreign Legion and manage to stay wholly devoted to each other. Beaten down, broken, and sometimes bloody, they serve as models of absolute integrity which transcend traditional paths of moral thinking. Never faltering from their direction, never stopping from pain, and never complaining, the Geste brothers show the viewer what it means to be human in times of desperation and need.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I almost always love seeing classic old movies I've never seen before, like all the Hitchcock films I've watched for the first time in the last year. Even films that aren't exactly my type, like 'Now, Voyager,' have their interests which I find enjoyable. But I must say I think I've finally stumbled across a cinema classic that I found boring, confusing, and just plain goofy- 'Beau Geste.' What was I expecting? Well, an exciting drama having to do with the French Foreign Legion, I suppose. As I read the cast members, my interest increased. Gary Cooper, Ray Milland, and Robert Preston are the three brothers whose lives are chronicled. A very young Susan Hayward plays Milland's love interest (she has almost nothing to do except play piano and look pretty.) Broderick Crawford is not immediately recognizable to those only familiar with his much later 'Highway Patrol' series. And Charles Barton of all people plays one of the soldiers. (Who? you ask. Charles Barton, the principal director of the Abbott &amp; Costello films.) 'Beau Geste' certainly starts off strikingly enough. A Foreign Legion detachment arrives to reinforce one of its forts in the Sahara Desert. There they find the entire company dead from an attack by Arabs, yet their corpses are propped up at their posts to give the impression of the base still being defended. It is a grisly and spooky scene and, as it turns out, actually the movie's ending, as the rest is a flashback leading up to it. We meet the Geste brothers, Beau, John, and Digby, as children, with their constant companion, Isobel. Then we see them as young adults, though frankly the brothers don't seem to have grown up much. As I said, 'goofy' is good way to describe them. There is some intrigue over a family jewel, a huge sapphire, that ultimately turns out to be a red herring of sorts. The brothers all join the Foreign Legion; Beau is ultimately killed, then Digby, leaving John to return home and (we assume) marry Isobel. Along the way they have to deal with a sadistic sergeant, Markoff (Brian Donlevy) and a weaselly fellow soldier (J. Carroll Naish), both of whom suspect Beau has the sapphire and conspire to steal it from him. At one point, Markoff appears ready to execute almost the entire company for mutiny when, luckily, the Arabs attack. I couldn't help wondering why nobody killed Markoff when they got their rifles back. There is much silly banter back and forth between the brothers, a lot of venomous spouting-off from Markoff, and the occasional exciting battle scene. But in the end, it really doesn't add up to much and the film peters out to a brief final scene that seems more of a shrug than a climax. 'Beau Geste' is definitely no 'grand gesture.'</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A solid adventure tale told in big block figures perhaps but still fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Beau, Digby and John Geste are brothers who have been loyal to one another since childhood. When one of them is suspected of stealing a valuable jewel from their wealthy guardian Lady Brandon, Beau takes responsibility and leaves during the night. Blaming himself, Digby leaves later than morning, followed by John, who knows his brothers will have joined the foreign legion in disgrace and doesn't want them to be alone so sets out after them. Under the harsh eye of Sgt Markoff, the brothers band together even when they find they have enemies within the legion as well as the Arabs at the gate.There are surely so many remakes or variations on this story in the world that most people will already be familiar with the plot. As I came to watch the original I had seen several other version of one form or another but I still enjoyed this. The story does a terrible job of explaining why the brothers all ran off (and found each other) and it was just as well that it quickly moved past this and onto the main body of the story. The three brothers are far too jovial for my tastes but the main "bad" guy Markoff breaks them down into more convincing characters. Of course these are probably unfair criticisms because this is a broad adventure yarn and detail is not its strength. However with these basic blocks it does fashion an engaging tale that has intrigue, death, battle and mystery.The cast are a mixed bunch and it is telling that the material doesn't do a great deal to help them. Cooper, Milland and Preston all work well together but they only find depth towards the end of the film ? for too long they are back-slapping and happy regardless of what's happening round them. Thank goodness then for the scenery-chewing piece of work that is Donlevy. He loves every second of it and delivers a character that stands alongside Full Metal Jacket as one of the finest sergeants on screen.Overall then this is not a perfect film because it does have cut-out shapes instead of characters, leaving many of the actors just to puff out their chest and do the best they can. That said but it is still a solid adventure which has a great ending to compensate for the rather forced opening twenty minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie remains as one of my all time favorites.Brian Donlevy should have won an Academy Award for his performance. I have never been disappointed with any of Mr. Donlevy's performance, but, this one, is the apex of his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anglo-Saxon Attitudes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anglo-Saxon manhood was pretty largely celebrated in the Hollywood of the thirties and forties, which makes sense. The audiences for movies, both in the U.S. and abroad, tended to be either Anglo-Saxon themselves or to have similar attitudes and concerns. Brittania still ruled the waves in those days, and whatever the ethnic composition of moviegoers there was the prevailing attitude that not only was "white" right, but that Anglo white was the best kind of all.Beau Geste is not about Empire, or at least not the British one, but it has undercurrents. Adapted from a popular novel, it is a combination mystery story and action picture that begins with the theft of a valuable jewel back in England, and winds up in the French Foreign Legion in North Africa, where the three Geste brothers have retreated. We know that one of them stole the jewel. The question is, which one? Meanwhile, there's action aplenty, as Arabs attack the fort and the multi-ethnic military unit that must defend it. Nearly everyone who isn't Anglo is either a coward, a traitor, a swine, a murderer, a sadist or a thief. Only the Gestes, it seems, have dignity and values.Chauvinism is one thing, but Beau Geste just doesn't play fair. Most of the movies set in colonial outposts of the British Empire were jingoistic and arguably racist, yet within their narrow limits they showed both sides of the issue. To put it another way, while they were basically pro-Empire it was understood and communicated that this was not the only attitude there was, or even that it was the correct one. It was the attitude the film-makers chose. Gunga Din is a good example of this, with the loyal Gunga at one end of the spectrum, the evil Guru at the other. Many films of this type allowed for a little local color (so to speak), and gave off the general feeling that these native blokes weren't such bad fellows after all once you take into account their "heathen ways". Such were the times.Beau Geste plays the Anglo-Saxon card more often and with greater vigor than most, which is odd, since it isn't strictly speaking about either Empire or empires and is merely a lively adventure story, well told. While one wouldn't call the Gestes moral prigs, they do carry themselves a certain way. Looking down on others would be bad form, so they don't do it, or don't talk about it anyway. But they do look down on others. The others are, alas, worth looking down on, and thus the deck is stacked.Maybe this was in the book. I don't know. As someone with some roots that go back to Great Britain I must say that even I find these attitudes annoying, and I tend to go easy on the Brits. In other more overtly pro-British films from this period the Anglo business is more soft-pedaled, as if a mere by-product or symptom of being numero uno in much of what we now call the Third World. Here its in its fully glory, Viking funeral and all.Shorn of its attitudes, Beau Geste is a decent movie. William Wellman was a good man for this kind of story, and the opening scenes are marvelous. Gary Cooper has the lead, and his appeal has thus far eluded me. He was fine in cowboy parts but this British gentleman role was beyond him. Robert Preston is likewise an unlikely choice for a Brit, but Ray Milland was the real deal. Brian Donlevy barks commands with demonic energy and makes the most of his role as the despicable Sergeant Markoff. The movie's pacing is a little draggy, and it seems older than it is. Fort Zinderneuf is a splendid creation, as imposing as it name, which is also fittingly exotic since it houses so damn many of those foreign chaps.</fullReview>
