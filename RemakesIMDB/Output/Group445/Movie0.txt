		<shortDescription>Things Are not How They Seem to Be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Paris, the international police force and the Russian mafia are chasing Anthony Zimmer, an intelligent man responsible for laundry of dirty money in France. Zimmer was submitted to a plastic surgery, and his new face and voice are completely unknown. The only means to reach Zimmer is through his beloved mistress Chiara (Sophie Marceau), who is under surveillance of the police and the mobsters. While traveling by train to the country nearby Nice, the common man François Taillandier (Yvan Attal), who has the same body shape of Zimmer, is select by Chiara as if he were Zimmer and used as a bait to lure those that are pursuing her. When Taillandier is chased by the professional Russian killers, he runs the French police when the real situation begins to be disclosed to him."Anthony Zimmer" is a great thriller, with a situation that recalls Hitchcock's classic "North By Northwest", i.e., a man mistaken for another and pursued by criminals. The attractive story has many twists, a nice cast with the gorgeous Sophie Marceau and the efficient Yvan Attal in the lead roles. The beautiful locations in France is an amazing tour in this wonderful country. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Anthony Zimmer A Caçada" ("Anthony Zimmer The Hunting")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I liked it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are some movies you watch to learn something, and some you watch to be entertained, and some you watch for both purposes.This is a pure entertainment movie, and I liked it a lot. The most important things in a movie like this are to have a plot that twists and turns but remains at least semi-plausible, to have a reasonably attractive hero, a super-sexy femme fatale and appropriately menacing villains, and above all to keep up the pace no matter what. Anthony Zimmer does all of these things rather well. Throw in the bonus of lots of the high life -- the mountain-top super-house, the suite at the Carlton in Nice and all the rest -- and the extra bonus of a happy ending (I don't think that's a spoiler) and you make a very enjoyable evening out.Don't bother trying to work out later how all the bits fitted together. Some of them don't fit all that well, but then they never do in films like this, and it's not the point. They fit together well enough while you're watching it.I saw this at the annual festival of French films put on by the Alliance Française in Melbourne, Australia. It opened the Festival, and later was shown again at a multiplex. The later showing was originally supposed to be in one 250-seat cinema, but demand was so great that it eventually was shown in three 250-seaters simultaneously, all of which were completely full. We all went home happy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Is he only a pawn in her game...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...or she in his? Captivating, elegant little thriller. It's not spectacular in any obvious way, yet I couldn't take my eyes off the screen for just one second. It starts out almost exactly like "Mr Bean's Holiday": a guy on a southbound express train, headed for the coast, hoping for recreation. Which he won't find. That's where the the script leaves the common ground. It's rich in twists and turns, clever to the point of cunning. Production design and cinematography are among the most elegant you will find. Cool, minimalistic interior sets contrast with the time-tested cinematic sparkle of the Côte D'Azur. Similarly, wide-angle shots are inter-cut with extreme close-ups, e.g., of pills dancing on a shaking spiral staircase, the pulsing red halo of the caller light on a ringing telephone, or a pair of shades dropped casually into an earthenware bowl. Scenes you have seen a thousand times, this movie makes you see them with new eyes: a guy killing time watching TV, a car chase in an underground parking lot, or someone having coffee and reading the paper in the morning sun. Admittedly, Sophie Marceau helped to keep me interested. She plays a woman six years her junior, and she more than gets away with it. She is in the shape of her life. I think she may have had something done to her face, but it looks good and doesn't show. I can see why President Mitterand took her on his trips abroad as an icon of French allure. The five-second scene in which she wires herself for the showdown alone made it worth my while. The final plot twist may not be up to common standards of plausibility, but it doesn't subtract from 90 minutes spent in silent wonder at what the French can do with a little sunshine and lot of mascara.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not that bad, but the ending is unconvincing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not bad after all, but the ending has a problem with suspension of disbelief. Like in every other mystery identity movie, once you know you the bad guy really is, you tend to rewind the whole film in your memory and see if the whole thing is coherent. Which here is not the case. Even when the main character is alone (and therefore doesn't have to "act" in front of other characters who don't know who he really is) he seems to react like it were the first time he is in fancy hotel, etc. So, in a way, it's not the lead character who is lying to the other characters, but the filmmakers who are lying to us viewers. It's a great joy when it's done playfully by someone like Brian De Palma (in Dressed To Kill and Body Double), but this trick is irrelevant here !The final twist notwithstanding, the filmmakers are talented enough to create tension without resorting to many action set-pieces. And, everything being said and done, it's always a treat to watch Sophie Marceau act, though she somehow manages mostly to get involved in projects that don't match her talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A double take suspense - superb production.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Zimmer has disappeared with his ill-gotten riches, to change his looks and his voice with plastic surgery to escape the French customs police and a Russian mafia gang. A vacationer is selected on a train by Zimmer's girl friend, as having Zimmer's age and body build, and set up to appear to be Anthony Zimmer in order to fool Zimmer's pursuers. It works well, and the chase is on. One nuance of note: the customs police chief becomes fully aware at the end of what the viewer finds out.A great film in all ways - superb acting, pacing, plot, scenery, and background music - all integrated in a very involving film. See this first, then see the remake (The Tourist) with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie to realize the faults of the remake. The Tourist is not all that bad, perhaps even above average, but Anthony Zimmer is much better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Not very often have I watched a thriller that entertained me as much as this one, throughout its whole duration. I don't think this film made a big splash at the box office or earned much critical acclaim, which is a shame.In my view, its fascinating scenery, the many twists and turns, a fabulous Sophie Marceau, and not least a clever ending, make this pure entertainment to watch and would have deserved better.The film does remind me of Hitchcock at his best.Not all the pieces may fit together all the time, but I don't find this to be an issue with this movie. When the final credits rolled, I was still in a kind of trance smiling to myself about the clever storyline and its convincing presentation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When you're running for your life, who can you trust?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an engaging and quite clever thriller, produced, directed and acted as only the French do: stylish, cool, suave ? and with a twist. Or, was it a double twist? Here's the setup: a wanted criminal, Anthony Zimmer, is being hunted by the French police who want Zimmer in jail; and by the Russian mafia who just want him dead. Zimmer, however, has recently acquired a new face via plastic surgery; so nobody knows what he looks like now.He has a weakness, however: the femme fatale who, in this case, is Chiara (Sophie Marceau), who keeps in touch with Zimmer via classified messages in the Herald-Tribune. As his girl friend, she's instructed by letter, from Zimmer, to board a train and pick the man who most closely resembles Zimmer's size and shape ? and then play up to him as though he was in fact Anthony Zimmer. Why? Because Zimmer wants an available sap to act as stand-in when the mafia make their hit...Enter poor Francois Taillandier (Yvan Attal), minding his own business on the train when the gorgeous Chiara sets down opposite and, very adroitly, gets Francois to join her in her travels to the Cote d'Azur and a luxurious holiday? he thinks. Francois figures he's maybe in heaven for the first day, a wonderful dinner, followed by the potential for real romance.And then, the sky falls in...In short order, Francois is running for his life (almost like Dustin Hoffman in Marathon Man [1976] and for similar reasons) as the mafia try twice to kill him, Chiara reveals that she set him up, the mafia keep on trying to make a hit on him, the police try to help him, and Zimmer's still pulling the strings it seems. Things are closing in on Francois, and it seems like only a matter of time before he takes a hit.Not everything is as it seems, however...To say more would spoil this film for you. Suffice to say that, like Hitchcock and others before, the denouement between the police, the mafia and the elusive Zimmer is very satisfying, if somewhat contrived, perhaps.The ending, however, does raise some interesting questions and provides no firm answers, an aspect I particularly like ? because that allows me to formulate the complete end according to my own inclination. Besides, whenever you read about murder and mayhem in real life, you never get the full story anyway. Right? The cinematography is exquisite on the French coastline, the sound track is good, the acting is...oh, who cares...I was too busy looking at Sophie Marceau anyway. Okay ? the acting was adequate, but not spectacular.See this one. You won't regret the ninety minutes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story which we've seen many times in American movies. About the common gentle guy who without wanting so, gets involved in heavy things. And it could happen to all of us.The plot is rather clever, but you have some unanswered questions in the end. Sophie Marceaux plays the mystic lady and you never know whether she really is good or bad. Not even when the movie is over.What is a quite intelligent psychological drama, turns into a violent outburst. Anyway it's nice to watch such a plot in another environment; here the French Côte d'Azur. But it's too physical in the end and maybe the plot maker hasn't had any real good ideas about how to finish it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enchanting Sophie Marceau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A guy-next-door type translator (NOT "interpreter", mind you) (Yvan Attal) recently "ditched" (I took this from the sub-title in the version I saw) is on a train going to a seaside resort to enjoy a quiet vacation by himself when an enchanting woman (Sophie Marceau) sits opposite him and asks him to help her with the stuck zippers on her cardigan. Examples of stories starting with an encounter on the train can be easily found, for various genre: Strangers on a train (1951), Notre histoire (1984), Before sunrise (1995), just to name a few. Anthony Zimmer involves a crime mystery and a romance.The silly plot (and the even sillier plot twist) is there merely to provide a platform for Marceau and Attal to act, and does not worth talking about. Marceau can play the role of the beautiful enigmatic women without even trying and Attal delivers the persona of an all-too- familiar absolutely ordinary guy caught in a whirlwind of unsought excitement to perfection. But then, both handle the deeper second layer extremely well too. The well attended to mise en scene provides good support, and the effective script carries the movie in a delightfully crisp pace through its relatively short 90 minutes. Very pleasant to watch, but somewhat forgettable, maybe with the exception of the lovely image of Marceau.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not an exceptional movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found this movie a bit slow paced in many places, sometimes unnecessary so.However that being said, I have noticed that the major part of the plot has already been given away in the first 20 minutes of the film. If you watch and listen carefully, you will realize who Anthony Zimmer really is. I thought this is a real let down to this movie. Too predictable.Sofie Marceau is really very sexy in the movie, much better than what Hollywood filmed her in their movies. As usual, she portrays a woman who is coldly sexy, turning to a hot object of desire in several scenes.The plot of the movie is relatively simple, and its length is a bit too short. There were many subplot possibilities which were not explored.If you like a evenly-paced thriller, this is probably for you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Yvan Attal has a weakness for Sophie Marceau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anthony Zimmer" has an interesting story, new to me but not to other reviewers who have mentioned several other movies that have similar story lines ("The Tourist" and "Cypher"). The premise, which is really science fiction, is that the unseen Anthony Zimmer, a brilliant money launderer, can change his identity so that he is unrecognizable to one and all, including his girl friend for whom he has a weakness, Sophie Marceau.The story is a romance thriller. Zimmer is tired of being pursued, as by the Russian Mafia (always a convenient bogeyman in recent movies) and he really wants Marceau to be his. He presumably knows that she's an undercover agent for the police and realizes that the police are closing in on him, especially since he can't live without Marceau. He also wants her to want him, whereas she sees him as a target for arrest. And so he devises a plot that will achieve his goals, which are to renounce his life as a rich money launderer and secure Marceau for himself. This is one of those open-ended plots where he must take opportunities as they arise in order to get what he wants.The character played by Marceau is very interesting in the context of her being out to get Zimmer and having to deal with Attal's character, who seems to be an ordinary guy. She finds herself drawn to him. He in turn is very protective of her and exposes himself to great dangers, suggesting to her that Zimmer would not have done so and is a cad. She is somewhat confused and then finds herself saving the life of Attal's character.As a thriller, it is slow in some spots, a bit stand-offish, and even lacking in warmth, perhaps due to the constraining features of the plot. The photography and settings help compensate. Overall, it works reasonably well. It works best as a romantic cat and mouse game between Attal and Marceau, but I have to admit that their chemistry didn't seem real to me, partly because Marceau was playing such a cool, manipulative and remote person.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remake of Cypher (spoilers)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty much a remake of "Cypher", Canadian movie made three years before this(2002). Both revolve around a geeky main character, out of their depth in a dangerous world, rescued and in love with a cool good looking action capable femme fatal (Sophie Marceu/Lucy Liu)..who has the answers....and is also in love with them.In the end, despite both of them being geeky *very* everyman characters, their geek personas are in fact a disguise, they are actually the so far unseen central anti hero character (Anthony Zimmer/Sebastian Brooks) of the movie, a very secretive and highly capable independent agent, who's face has never been seem (except by the female central character).In both films, two bad guy organisations (Russian Mafi and French Police/Sunway Corp Digicorp) are chasing after him, however don't know what he looks like.In the end, the bad guy organisations are outsmarted, and the Zimmer/Brooks character escapes with the girl...the only people to witness his face are killed. Both movies even finish off with the respective couples traveling off into the sunset together.Anthony Zimmer is stylish in a typical French way, but Cypher itself is quite stylish and the original and the cleverer of the two. Jeremy Northam's acting is probably more solid, and Cypher is more sophisticated and harder to predict. If you have seen this French Version of Cypher, its worth seeing Cypher as a comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An entertaining film that does have a good time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Entertaining thriller, which tells the story of "François", an ordinary man who during a train journey meets "Chiara", a beautiful girl. For the police, this indicates that it is "Anthony Zimmer," a clever swindler who are in the spotlight, and they can not identify otherwise, they do not know his face. With this promising premise starts "Anthony Zimmer". Once the conflict, loses a bit of steam, but never bored, which is very pleasant during the whole film. The only negative is that the story is a bit simple, or perhaps predictable, but know how to entertain.In the other sections, also plays. The atmosphere is substantially achieved, with luxurious and warm and sunny scenes on the French coast. For its part, the technical section not remarkable: it is in this respect like any other tape. And finally, the cast is quite solvent, unremarkable. The protagonist, Yvan Attal, gives the appearance of an ordinary guy with no remarkable feature and Sophie Marceau is also well in her role as mysterious and sensual woman, which achieves her spectacular physical smoothly.In short, this is an entertaining film that does have a good time, but for fans of this genre is an ordinary film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A much more serious film than the Hollywood remake...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'd seen 'The Tourist' when it first came out over a year ago. The Angelina Jolie-Johnny Depp starrer was an entertaining film...one of the things which prevented it from being great though, was that it could never make up its mind as to whether it was a suspense thriller, an action thriller or a comedy. But I'm pleased to say that the French original 'Anthony Zimmer' has no such identity crisis.The plot of 'Zimmer' is very simple and in retrospect I can't but help feel that 'The Tourist' sometimes needlessly embellished (and in the process, complicated) the story. The simple premise allows for more focus on the characters, their motivations and their relationships. Another thing that stuck me while watching this film, in contrast to 'The Tourist' was that on the whole, it was a much more 'intelligent' film...things weren't always explained to the audiences word for word. Some things the viewer needs to put together himself while watching the film. Case in point, Chiara's (Sophie Marceau) motivation in befriending Francoise Tallandier (Yven Attal) as part of her scheme to fool Anthony Zimmer's pursuers is something which one has to assume based on the action on-screen and other subtle hints-its only explicitly spelled out more than halfway through the film (whereas in 'The Tourist', its made glaringly clear to us pretty much from the start).A major superficial difference between the two versions is to do with the style and grandeur of the remake, which is contrasted by the relative simplicity of the original. Whereas the remake had a speedboat chase in Venice, the original has an equivalent scene of a chase sequence in an underground parking lot. The lack of emphasis on set designs and scenic beauty reinforces the film's prime focus on the character's and their story and also serves to give the film a much more 'serious' feel as opposed to the flamboyance of the remake.Special mention must be made of the lead actor Yven Attal. Unlike Johnny Depp's comedic take on the bumbling American tourist caught up in a world of intrigue, Attal's character is an ordinary man who is keenly aware of the danger he's in, but who also adapts to circumstances quickly enough. His relationship with Marceau's character does read more like genuine love, as opposed to the relationship between Depp and Jolie in the remake which felt more like an infatuation/fascination on Depp's part. Sophie Marceau's 'Chiara' is likewise a VERY different character from Angelina Jolie's 'Elise Ward'...unlike the glamorous and enigmatically playful Elise, Chiara is a much harsher individual, though she does reveal a softer side as the story progresses.On the whole, I feel 'Anthony Zimmer' is a much more serious, and tighter film, than the remake, though I will always remain a fan of the comically thrilling Depp-Jolie starrer as well!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Anthony Zimmer Hitchcockian</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First I have to confess Alfred Hitchcock is not my favorite filmmaker - perhaps partly due to the somewhat clunky exposition he sometimes used but there are elements of Anthony Zimmer which I enjoyed and which recalled Hitchcock at his best. As so many have said before me Sophie Marceau is very,very good in Anthony Zimmer but , for me, Yvan Attal was the standout. I have liked his somewhat deadpan style since "Les Patriots" (still one of my favorite thrillers) and here, as the 'ordinary' guy supposedly caught up in things beyond his knowledge he plays a much more realistic Cary Grant type than you would usually see in a Hitchcock movie. Sure, you can tell pretty quickly he's not really who he seems to be but then how long did it take you to figure that Grant wasn't all he seemed in "North By Northwest". That's part of the fun of films like Anthony Zimmer. I've seen "Zimmer" twice and I'll be more than happy to watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film (which came as add-on to German magazine ComputerBild) last night, in high anticipation for Sophie Marceau. In the end, I felt a bit disappointed - slightly giddy by the twisty plot, and I had waited for Marceau's strong acting (as seen in Marquise) in vain.Then I read the comments here, and was thinking what I would write in a comment, and became unsure. And decided to watch it again this morning, for breakfast, what I hardly ever do. And this time around, being acquainted with the plot and the end, it was a whole different experience - and much more pleasing. Now I could really enjoy the music and camera-work, and the little details all contributing to artfully build up a great suspense... more in the head of the viewer than on screen (witness several chase scenes, or even just when Chiara takes off her bikini top).One detail that pleased me most in the first viewing was the mirror in the questioning room. You could call such things red herrings, but they certainly worked very well for me.I'll certainly watch "Anthony Zimmer" again - with all its quotes of Hitchcock (the mansion on the hill, and many more) it can stand up well on its own, and be enjoyed even though one knows how it ends, like a true classic. And I could even appreciate Marceau's much subtler acting...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I decided to watch the movie entirely for Sophie Marceau but Yvan Attal was surprisingly good. There are some scenes in the movie which demand praise and some which are unconvincing. The scene which forms the crux of the movie ought to have been done with more finesse that is Anthony Zimmer being revealed. I have always thought that foreign language movies which are screened in other countries are award winning serious movies and honestly ANTHONY ZIMMER changed that for me although I admit I have'not watched too many foreign language movies. Two scenes which are standout are the TGV train sequence and the climax when the police are waiting for ZIMMERs arrival. Sophie Marceau looks as beautiful as ever in the movie. Watch this movie for good story telling and a very believable setting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In here somewhere is a strong movie hidden in an espionage and crime cliché...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Zimmer (2005)Ah, this has its moments, but it sure is overly clever and at times overly derivative. The interactions and scenario of an elite crook and some undercover and suspicious types on the boundaries of the big hunt for him are taken straight from a lot of previous movies--even from "North by Northwest," of all things, which you'll catch in the train conversation and in the general nature of the leading woman in both cases. It's all well enough done to keep you watching if this is your kind of movie, and I didn't mind traipsing along even as it seemed to bowl into a lot of old tricks.What was worse, overall, was the dependence on a huge trick, one that you might or might not anticipate, and which comes along at the very end like a splotch of ketchup on your plate. Yeah, yeah, we were warned the escapee was a master of disguise and had had a lot of plastic surgery, but still, it's just not enough, not enough.Everything is set in the south of France, Nice to be exact, and is pretty and fun (like a lot of other movies set there). The movie itself is French, of course, and in one nice scene a man starts to ask a question in English, and another man (one of the chief cops, we suppose) says, "I don't speak in English," or something to that effect. It seems a perfect point to make as so many movies these days are partly in English as if to make it easier on British and American (and Aussie and South African and Singaporean, yes yes) audiences. (A lot of French films in particular use a bit of English--or a lot--to do more than just sound international.)But I find an interesting nuance mostly because the movie is otherwise a very straightforward affair. Enjoy. See it on a plane. Have alternatives in mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fair attempt at a French thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film has a Hollywoodesque quality that screams "Us Frenchies can make thrillers too!". I'm not saying that it's a bad flick: the actors are a pleasure to watch, particularly the absolutely stunning Sophie Marceau (and this is coming from a straight girl). However, the ending didn't come as a surprise: I never rewound the film in my head thinking "I should have seen it coming!", because I did see it coming. It's not that there are any hidden clues (and, as another viewer commented, if you think back, the protagonist's attitude seems rather incoherent), it's just that the least probable suspect is our guy. And the least probable guy is always the one. Which leads me to my final point: from the soundtrack to the unconvincing conclusion the same name comes to mind: Kaiser Sose. Yes, Anthony Zimmer tries very hard to be The Usual Suspects, without the craftiness (but with a foxy lady).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is great entertainment. Beautifully filmed (great aerial shots) and well acted especially by Yvan Attal who was just superb in the role of a nerdy mystery reading accountant type. Marceau does a fine job although you find her a bit bitchy at first. Also the story is not perfect her role is not completely logical but this is a minor thing...There are twists and the final one makes the movie work. In US films the bad guys mostly don't get away with it--you have to go to more cynical European creations to get the ending you want. In fact during the movie I was despairing of a stupid ending which did not happen.This movie is one the great finds I have made on Netflix streaming---some others include "Aura" and lots of others.... You can skip the bad ones you start watching and go on to something else...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>North by Northwest in France with a twist ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an excellent film to watch with a significant other ... but make sure to schedule some "debriefing time" afterward. If you like films such as North by Northwest and The Thomas Crown Affair, you are bound to be intrigued by Anthony Zimmer.Sophie Marceau plays her part as femme fatale with a perfect mix of Eva Marie Saint's Artemisian aloofness and Rene Russo's no-nonsense sensuality, and it is a pleasure to watch her interaction with Yvan Attal throughout the film. I think I can safely promise that as soon as the film has ended, you will want to see it all over again.In an age of computer-generated action and ever-expanding body parts, it is true bliss to be seduced by a film that generates suspense in such a variety of ways. Jerome Salle needs no ticking bombs or buried treasures to tell a good story. As long as a man knows how to dress, how to write a script, and how to deal with a lady like Chiara, the rest will naturally follow ... Too bad so few Anglo-Saxon writers/directors respect those basic rules.Bottom line: If you rent Anthony Zimmer, you won't need a back-up film. Just make yourself comfortable, and get on that train. (PS: I'm not sure shoes like that are legal outside France ... )</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had forgotten I wanted to see this film, and while I thought The Tourist has it's good points, that class is awesome, I only wish I knew it was really a remake of Anthony Zimmer. That would have changed everything.Can't use English folk think of good ideas on our own? So many remakes that have far less meaning or solid characters. OK. The Tourist is a funny, and AZ is much more rugged, despite the location. I wish I could compare the sexiness of Sophie to Angelina the other way around, but I have to say Angelina was a natural at wooing poor old Johnny. So powerful. Sophie is a different story, but they sure know how to photograph her.I like the rawness of AZ. A shame this was not my first impression of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Tourist</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Anthony Zimmer" is a conventional romantic thriller and con movie which finds a gang of Russian criminals and law enforcement agents frantically attempting to apprehend master criminal Anthony Zimmer.The film was directed by Jerome Salle, whose style is unimaginative and at times dull. The film was remade by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck as "The Tourist", a much better film. The only thing Salle's film has over Donnersmarck's is the presence of the always stunning Sophia Marceau. She plays Zimmer's love interest.5/10 ? Worth no viewings. See "The Tourist" instead, a critically maligned ode to Hitchcock and Stanley Donen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I doubt a translation can do this justice ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... as so much can (and obviously does) get lost in the process.I was surprised so many agreed to the main user_comment at the beginning, until I noticed likely none had seen the french version.What I particularly liked is that there are various pieces of information what can figure out; like the fact the Sophie (Chiara) is hiding something, what cannot be guessed immediately. Why is even harder. Motivitations are at the core of such movies, and since some things we take for granted can lead us down the wrong path, and like a chess player having read several moves ahead, one must backtrack and start over.Ms. Marceau surprised me - I knew her to be very pretty, but in this movie she adds a new twist. Mr. Attal is also very good - I'm not sure how easy/difficult it is to portray this - but I was hooked from the get-go.### It's one of those movies that makes you feel very intensely, even if you can question the motives (i.e. you know that if a "femme-fatale" hits on a plain looking guy, she wants something). Should he go along with this - common sense dictates you shouldn't but there are times in a person's life where you are not ready to make the right decision or don't care to - not realizing how serious the situation can become. ###All in all, a very enjoyable movie for those tired of CGI, or totally unrealistic movie story lines.Keep 'em coming, JM.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Weak copy of "Cypher"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anthony Zimmer is an average suspension movie, but if you have seen Cypher (http://imdb.com/title/tt0284978), you know how the movie is going to unwind from the first five minutes on. The story is very similar (not to say, in some parts identical), although in Cypher, the main character actually "deleted" his memory, so the entire "Who's the guy?" game actually makes sense.As has been mentioned elsewhere, even when alone, Zimmer doesn't act like himself, and it doesn't really make sense why, unless to lead on the viewer. The movie has a lot of potential, but doesn't go far beyond the average, which is a pity. Sophie Marceau pulls off her part nicely (you don't really see her 40 years, do you?), and tragically outshines everybody else. The characters remain flat and two-dimensional (even the main character...), and the final twist just doesn't come off right (especially since most viewers will have the identity shuffle figured out by now).If you haven't seen Cypher, maybe this movie works for you. If you have seen it, this really isn't a lot of fun, as it gets boring pretty quickly. It gets an average rating for the nice camera work and Sophie Marceau, but I'm sad to say it would probably have scored higher if the producers had directly copied Cypher.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a wonderful love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The only interest in the movie is the relationship between Chiara and the mysterious man. Of course, you guess quite easily the truth, but if you like Chiara you will be in love with the movie. Sophie Marceau has never been as beautiful and demonstrates at last that she is a great actress. There is at least a real sadness, a real mystery in her eyes. The music does a lot for a story: of course, it is very "Hitchcockian". The movie is clearly inspired by Vertigo and by To catch a thief, an it gets some of their respective magic. The only disappointment is Samy Frey, who tries too much to look mysterious. another pleasure of the movie: its location. A wonderful home to die for, appears at the end. It must be located in Ibiza, because i don't think you can find something as wild on the Cote d'Azur nowadays.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>far from Hitchcock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director Jerome Salle wanted this film to remind us Hitchcock's or Polanski's movies with the next door guy type getting caught into a web of mistaken identity. He actually tries more with a story which may have had a better chance if it decided whether it wants to play on the thriller or on the romantic movie line. Unfortunately he seems to try to do both and fails on both, because we are never sure what the director wants for us, and because the point of gravity where he takes us changes too sudden. We are left with a well acted film with Sophie Marceau and Yvan Attal leading a good team of actors, but also with a feeling of in-satisfaction because despite the good ideas the film ends by looking too short and too superficial to give us time to be thrilled or to be moved.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So Who IS In The Frame?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Cryptic is as good a word as any to describe this. If red herrings are your thing then you've come to the right place. Jerome Salle takes a leaf out of Patrice Leconte's book and starts on a pair of feminine feet but unlike Sandrine Bonnaire in Leconte's movie, who wore granny shoes, these are stylish high heels. In another departure Salle keeps us waiting to see the woman in question approximately three or four times as long as Leconte, who revealed Bonnaire in less than one minute screen time. Salle teases us in several ways; showing a female hand - her back is to us - selecting and lighting a cigarette in close up, then more feet as she walks the length of a platform before finally boarding a train and walking past several empty seats to select a place opposite Yvan Attal - whom we might be forgiven for assuming is the eponymous Zimmer - and even then her eyes are hidden behind dark glasses. Friend Zimmer is by all accounts a criminal genius wanted far and wide by both sides of the law. Attal is strangely subdued this time around with little or none of the macho arrogance of his small-time crook in 'Bon Voyage' and Sophie Marceau is suitably enigmatic as well she might be given the role she's been handed. Ultimately this is one you watch for the acting rather than the plot which could conceal itself behind a spiral staircase.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Anthony Zimmer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't find the plot "silly" twisted, and not only providing a platform for the two actors to act.In fact, this movie goes far beyond the easy crap usually sold. I it a movie that takes you back in the intrigues that could be found in the old spy movies genre.The two actors are doing a great job and the plot is unbelievably smart. It some how reminds me of a the previous movie "Patriots" with Yvan Attal.In this movie, everything might be real. This movie deals with one aspect of what life is for some people in the world: an uneasy understandable manipulation of individuals by other individuals.I'm sorry for the guy who did put the previous comment but I just feel that he should read more books, or maybe go back to school and learn to think "out of the box" before he puts unadequate comments that are to viewers, to the director and to the actors a real insult.Stratege thinker Sun Zi said 2500 years ago : an country without spy is like a blind army. What do you think is happening now ?</fullReview>
