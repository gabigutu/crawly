		<shortDescription>An Enjoyable Light Comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) is trying to protect his daughter Theresa (Zoe Saldana) from ending up with the wrong guy, and though he does a thorough background check on her new boyfriend Simon (Ashton Kutcher), there's only one thing his research didn't tell him. He's white and he wants to marry his daughter.The "meeting the parents" premise has been done to death recently with Monster-in Law and Meet the Fockers being the most recent films. However, what the film lacks in originality, it makes it up with laughs. There were a lot of funny moments and the movie hardly ever got boring. However, most of the funny bits were used in the trailer and this makes the jokes a little less effective since they are already expected. Also, the repeat value of the movie is very low. It's worth watching once but that's pretty much it. I don't think that's a bad thing since most light comedies are like that.I think the film works well because of the two leads. Both Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher give funny performances and they have nice chemistry together. Their scenes were the best and they never felt forced. Zoe Saldana also gives a good performance and she has come a long way from appearing in Crossroads. Most of the supporting actors are also funny including Judith Scott, who plays Bernie Mac's wife. Mike Epps also makes a cameo though it wasn't that good.Kevin Rodney Sullivan directs and he only does an okay job. The first half of the film is pretty funny and the racial issues are handled lightly. During the second half, the film becomes all serious and it's kind of awkward. The director ditches the laughs for awhile and he approaches the issue in a mature manner. It kind of works but some of the serious scenes felt fake. It seemed like the actors were about to burst out laughing at any second and the film also got kind of dull. The ending was surprisingly strong though. The changes of tone in the film worked out okay but they weren't as effective as they could have been. In the end, Guess Who is worth a rental, nothing more though. Rating 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To take a work of pure genius (Guess Who's Coming To Dinner / Stanley Kramer 1967) and turn it into a Bernie mac, Ashton Kutcher roll reversal. I have nothing against the actors in this film... BUT! The original still stands strong as a cinematic masterpiece. Reviewing the troubled historic times past. Any comedic treatment of this classic work is nothing more than panhandling.You can rent or buy the original for under $10. Sydney Portier was and is his generation. Don't be fooled, This series of remakes being spit out by the studios are simply because they already have the rights to the films and they will be the only ones making money. But the best question is what will they remake in 20 years from now.Don't buy any of it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bernie Mac still makes this movie a pleasant one.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course this movie is mostly being blasted because it was released so shortly after the success of "Meet the Parents" and "Meet the Fockers", which uses the exact some concept. Only difference with this movie is that it's about an interracial couple. But also when you look beyond this and ignore the fact that this movie is basically the interracial version of "Meet the Parents", it just isn't a great movie because for a comedy its surely lacking. Basically Bernie Mac was the only reason that I still found this movie to be an enjoyable one to watch. Perhaps biggest problem is that the movie is too predictable. No not just with its story, I mean basically everyone already knows in advance how this movie is going to end but also comical wise the movie is too predictable. They surely didn't came up with a whole lot of original moments and because everything happens in such a predictable manner, the comedy also just doesn't always work out.The movie could had been a better one, had it handled its subject of an interracial relationship better. That way the movie could perhaps had send out a message but it doesn't really does so now. The movie doesn't take away any stereotypes, instead it only sort of confirms them and it happily does so, in order to provide the movie with racial-typed humor. Somehow I have the feeling that it perhaps could had worked out better had the guy been black and the girl white and so her parents, who they are visiting, as was the case in the original movie this movie got based on; "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", staring Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier and Katharine Hepburn, which was also a drama rather than a comedy. Even though I haven't seen that movie yet I still am sure of it that that movie its theme worked out better, perhaps also because it was a '60's movie when interracial relationships obviously were still a bigger issue. Seriously, when I take a black girl or Asian or whatever home one of these my parents surely won't make a big issue out of it at all. So isn't this a movie a bit too outdated already with its theme and only relevant had it been made about 40 years ago? That is if the film-makers intentions were to take away the stereotypes and reluctances and intolerability of people towards interracial relationship but I have the idea that the film-makers simply dropped this idea and intentions and went for a simple full-blood comedy instead. I haven't seen Bernie Mac in an awful lot of movies, also since he started out pretty late white his acting career but so far I have always liked him in his comical roles. He plays it serious and sarcastic rather than over-the-top funny which makes him such a great and hilarious actor in my opinion. It's also mostly his movie in my opinion and Asthon Kutcher gets pushed more to the background by him, even though Ashton Kutcher surely ain't a bad actor either, no matter what other people always say about him.A comedy you can surely do without but when you decide to watch it you'll still be most likely lightly entertained by it.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Even though the movie is corny, it still sends a message that love will prevail. Family means everything and without their support, love and consideration, life will be harder. Just knowing that your family loves you and what you love, makes facing the world that much easier.I compare this to My Big Fat Greek Wedding in cultural attributes. There is a world out there of give and take and for the most part, I feel people have forgotten that. These two movies show that consideration and the almighty give and take are important to long-lasting relationships in any culture, religion and family.I recommend watching this movie with an open mind, hoping to laugh, love, cry and remember how to have a healthy relationship and I hope this inspires you to have consideration for others in your world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>an "edgy" comedy without the edge</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When it was released in 1967, "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" was acclaimed as a "breakthrough" film for its lighthearted, yet serious, depiction of an interracial romance. In the years since, society has moved so far in the direction of acceptance of so-called "mixed marriages" that any remake is bound to feel, at least to some extent, superfluous and anachronistic. And that is exactly the case with "Guess Who," a 2005 update whose abbreviated title is only the first of the many changes the filmmakers have rung on the Stanley Kramer original.The screenwriters' first alteration involves switching the race roles, so that it is now a black family having to accept a white male as a prospective in-law rather than the other way around. Bernie Mac assumes the Spencer Tracy role as the father whose world is turned upside down when his beloved daughter brings a Caucasian boyfriend (Ashton Kutcher as a white Sidney Poitier) home to meet the family. On the distaff side, we have Judith Scott taking over for Katherine Hepburn as the understanding mother and Zoe Saldana replacing Katherine Houghton as the freethinking daughter.Since interracial marriage is no longer the hot-button issue it once was, the filmmakers have been forced to inject a number of other non-race-related plot complications into the mix to develop and maintain the conflict and drama. Thus, we have Kutcher trying to hide the fact from both his fiancé and her family that he has recently quit his high-paying job at a prestigious firm and that he may, in fact, be the target of a securities-and-exchange commission probe. Indeed, with Kutcher spending most of his time trying to win over his critical and overbearing future father-in-law, "Guess Who" feels more like a remake of "Meet the Parents" than of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." The real problem with "Guess Who" is that it rarely has the courage of its convictions. Having decided to tackle a relatively dicey topic, the film too often drops the issue in favor of scenes that wouldn't pass muster even on a third-rate sitcom. For every scene that is incisive and daring - i.e. Kutcher telling a series of black jokes at the family dinner table - there is another that is pure Hollywood hokum (Mac and Kutcher sleeping in the same bed together, Mac and Kutcher having a go-cart race to determine who has the higher testosterone level and the greater machismo, etc.).All of the performers are fine, especially Mac and Kutcher in the lead roles. However, they just haven't been given very sophisticated material to work with here. "Guess Who" might have been a better film had it aimed more for genuine, hard-edged satire and less for lowbrow slapstick and predictable romantic comedy sentimentality.Still, it's been 38 years since "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" first shocked the nation with its in-your-face defiance of miscegenation laws, and the world has since moved on to other issues of social injustice and marital definition. Which is why, in the year 2005, "Brokeback Mountain" was a breakthrough film and "Guess Who" was not.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More nonsense from pap-Maestro director Kevin Sullivan. Another Cordon Bleu of racially motivated comedy designed to suck the dollars from a dumbed-down middle America. The cliché of the Oedipally challenged father refusing to relinquish his jilted grip on his daughter is far from a stranger to our screens. A successful director's job these days seems simply to be that of taking an already burned out concept, removing all intelligible plot moments, merging in a few racially 'hip' moments and then repeat until they have enough money to breed and make more of these sordid offerings. The 'comdedic' castration scene alone should be enough to silence this director's career forever. Nonetheless in addition the scene when the delusional father starts physically befouling the prospective stud's mattress in an attempt to quite literally dirty him in his fiancée's eyes is perhaps one of the lowest points of cinema in the last hundred years. A degrading attempt at comedy, at best a cringing wallet filler for the director. All I can say is that I hope his daughter turns into a transsexual mud-wrestler and elopes with an incontinent zebra.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Guess Who' is a good reflection of the changes in society since the Sydney Portier version was made many decades ago. Ashton Kutcher is an underrated comedic actor, who despite his good looks, can still be quite goofy and amusing. The movie raises good points about reverse racism, people's continuing prejudices and the pressures society puts on 'mixed-race' couples. I think the director and writers found a happy medium that allowed issues to be raised while at the same time keeping the movie light-hearted, funny and entertaining. If you are looking for something meaningful and entertaining at the same time, with a touch of romance and some eye candy, this is the movie for you!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, I am not a fan of Bernie Mack and certainly not of Ashton Kutcher, but I liked this movie.While the movie is certainly predictable, it has its humorous moments. Although Bernie Mack plays a little overly protective father, he does not over play it to the point that it is just a ridiculous caricature. Ashton Kuetcher has a good haircut and looks like a nice clean cut male, not the long haired goof-ball we usually see.My favorite scene was the one at the dinner table. Not to give anything away, there were racist comments and racist jokes, but in good taste and fun. That scene shows that both sides can be racist in their own rights but still enjoy a good joke when it is truly funny.While not the masterpiece that "Look Who's Coming to Dinner" was, it was a whole lot more fun to watch.This is you typical formula romantic comedy, but it is heavier on comedy than romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ashton Kutcher is going out with Zoe Saldana and while they do not have a problem with their relationship a lot of other people do. That's because Kutcher is white and Saldana, welllll, isn't. One of the main people having a problem with their relationship is Bernie Mac (playing Saldana's father), about to meet his daughter's partner for the first time and completely unprepared for the obvious racial differences between them. It's a remake of Guess Who's Coming To Dinner for the MTV generation.I like Ashton Kutcher and I also like Bernie Mac so this movie benefits from their central performances. It also has to be said that the rest of the cast do just as well and are all likable enough. So the cast isn't a problem.There is also a little bit more going on here than you might expect, with the movie admirably tackling not only racism from one point of view but any prejudice between races, generations and classes. It's actually a bit braver than most during some moments (ie, Kutcher relating a number of "black" jokes at the dinner table) but then, sadly, dwindles back to rom-com clichés whenever scenes are lacking any tension.The direction from Kevin Rodney Sullivan is blah, everything stays within very standard Hollywood limits and, for the most part, it's unexciting, safe movie-making at its most average with character development at its lamest. Which is a shame. Because I DO like Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac.See this if you like: Just Married, Save The Last Dance, Soul Man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a delightfully funny movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found "Guess Who" to be absolutely delighful. Even though there are a lot of differences between "Guess Who" and "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", I still see a resemblance. I also think that Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy would have enjoyed it. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher did a wonderful job. They seem to work well with each other.As far as the movie is concerned, I found nothing racial in it, except for the scene at the dinner table when Simon makes some racial jokes, but remember it was only a movie. Yes, the jokes weren't necessary but they were part of the script and movie, and I think no one should have gotten offended because it was just a movie.As far Bernie Mac's character and Ashton Kutcher's characters getting off to a slow start, sometimes that happens between two characters. Eventually you see them start a friendship near the middle of the movie.Even though there were some serious things happening in the movie, basically the movie was very funny. A perfect example is when Bernie Mac's character doesn't believe Ashton Kutcher's character about him knowing about the racing circuit and tests him by racing him in a go-cart, I found it extremely funny when they start to race each other and try to beat each other and land up tearing through the hedges and getting stopped by a police officer. Another funny example is when Ashton Kutcher's character teaches Bernie Mac's character the tango and later on Bernie Mac's character denies to his wife that he was taught the tango by Ashton Kutcher's character.This movie had a great cast. Zoe Saldan is extremely great in this movie and so is Judith Boot, as is Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac.I basically found nothing offensive about the movie except the scene at the dinner table. But like I said before the movie was absolutely delightful and very funny</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's do the tango</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not having a clue about what this film was about, and for lack of better films on cable, we decided to check "Guess Who". Then, it dawned on us this was a remake of Stanley Kramer's 1967 film "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner". Both films use the William Rose original premise about a prospective son-in-law that is being brought by a daughter so her parents can meet the young man. Everything has been reversed for this occasion. While Sidney Poitier was the black fiancé, in this new version, it's Ashton Kutcher, a white man, who is the odd man out.Most of the comments in this forum are downright negative. We don't think the creators of the film wanted to capitalize on the original model, or even to imitate another recent movie of the same theme, "Meet the Parents", this was just a vehicle in which to showcase the talents of Mr. Kutcher and that funny man, Bernie Mac. The film was directed by Kevin Rodney Sullivan.That said, the film, although predictable has some good moments. Both Mr. Mac and Mr. Kutcher show an affinity for the roles they are playing and both are good together. Best moment in the film has to be the home dinner sequence where the Jones family is sharing the meal with Simon and he starts with his ethnic jokes about blacks. This would have been something no film would have dared to show because Hollywood would not dare offend Afro-Americans in this climate of affirmative action, and they wouldn't dare to get Rev. Jackson, or Rev. Al Sharpton to have them boycott the movie.Aside from Bernie Mac and Anton Kutcher, the lovely Zoe Saldana is seen as Theresa, the daughter who is living with Simon, and comes home to be made aware of her parent's unease caused because of the ethnic background of the boyfriend. Judith Scott, a beautiful actress that should be seen more often, plays Marilyn, the understanding mother. Hal Williams and Kellee Stewart, are seen as the other members of the Jones family.Just enjoy the film for what it is, as comparisons are always unfair. Who would not like to see Bernie Mac and Anton Kutcher rehearsing the tango late one night on the patio?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Consistently Comic, Cultural "Mac Attack"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To be confessional, I didn't have the bar set high for this recent installment of "the comical bridges of the races" Bernie Mac-Ashton Kutcher product. Surprised as I was, "Guess Who" very much surpassed those expectations and worked throughly well as a hilarious comedy that attacks cultural differences with an irreverent, raunchy, and jovial punch. Simply put, here is a film that could have excelled with any number of premises, given the inimitable charisma and comic wit of Bernie Mac, who flat out carries the show on his own piercing, sarcastic own. Ashton Kutcher works well with what he is given, yet his character comes across as a trite, clumsy bumpkin to Mac's ferocious flare, and is merely the butt of every comedic catastrophe, rather than a multi-dimensional character who can hold a candle to thwarting his own preordained chagrin. Kutcher gets involved with "his other half", is initially terrified at meeting her father (he's better with moms), and all hilarity ensues when he and "the father with the bulging eyes and capricious temperament" get uncomfortably and frolically acquainted with one another, eventually realizing that maybe this relationship will require some self-depreciation and frenzy to eventually be accepted. To be certain, much of the comedy adheres to the "racial tension" theme, and there is of course plenty of the proverbial cultural clash that abounds- consummating with, you guessed it, a torrential family dinner scene in which Kutcher's "empowerment" eventually gets the best of him, but "Guess Who" isn't content to strictly deplore racial boundaries, as it also works effectively as a howlingly funny "meet the father from hell" scenario, succeeding solely on Mac's uncannily nimble charisma and wit, who has an aura about him that would make any future son-in-law shrink to his skin, or to a greater extent, be obliged to sleep and "spoon" with the man! Of course, while this is consistently amusing and funny, what we're mostly left with toward the end are the platitudes of mawkish sentimentality, of "rekindling the love we lost" that seem to always hobble the comedy of even the most outrageous of premises, as if the premise has been exhausted enough and becomes more of an "endearing love story" than a convivial comedy... Why is that? Anyhow, I would solidly recommend "Guess Who" for its cutting, raucous comedy and for Bernie Mac's spunky, fleeting charisma that really gives a convincing element to this otherwise wired premise. The laughing stock might not be constant throughout the film, yet there is just enough humor to enjoy and laugh yourself silly. After all, watching Bernie Mac popping a blood vessel over a basketball game, debasing a man's character for not being avid in sports, or keeping a cautious and close body near Kutcher's "nighttime affairs" is certainly worth the price of admission! *** out of ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>OK remake of a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This oddly titled remake of Spencer Tracy's final flick, GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, has Bernie Mac as the bullying patriarch of a family who learns one of his daughters is dating a white guy (Ashton Kutcher). Worse, he's a white guy out of work and who tends to lie. (Imagine if this had been the case in the original, which involved Spencer Tracy meeting his daughter's black boy friend. But never fear: the beau in that movie was played by Saint Sidney Poitier, who is a doctor, for heaven's sake, and can do no wrong.) In the remake, a clash of cultures predictably ensues, embroidered with large doses of slapstick. The daughter herself is played by someone named Zoe Saldana and is dull as dishwater, but then who in their right mind would want to date the klutzy Kutcher, who keeps falling down and stumbles over every sentence? Mac is pretty subdued, as befits his role as a loan officer of a small town bank. Clichés abound as the movie drags onto the inevitable lovable, huggable conclusion. But to believe this gal's many relatives would openly accept Kutcher as her fiancé places GUESS WHO in the realm of science fiction. It's watchable, but avoid the part where Mac and Kutcher tango together. Fast-forward that part or better yet, leave the room for two minutes. It's embarrassing and just not funny.</fullReview>

Ashton Kutcher was the same although a bit more ganglier. All I wanted to do was jump into the television set and give them both a kick in the pants. The script was bland, the acting was bordering on vaudeville and the storyline was handled with no tact at all. There is absolutely and totally NO comparison to "Guess who's coming to dinner".

Even Bernie Mac wasn't funny in this movie, which I didn't think was even possible. It's pretty much like this - you know how on his show he's basically doing a watered down version of what he he does in his standup? Well, this was like the third filtration from the standup and basically a watered down version of what he does on the show. I don't even know why this movie was PG-13. It was a solid PG as far as I could tell. You could edit out the word "sh*t" maybe a couple of times and show it uncut on network television.I hate it when comedies forget to be funny.

		<fullReview>A remake of Guess who's coming to dinner, but this time, it's hilarious because Ashton Kutcher is the minority!! Oh the hilarity of racial tension.....Theresa takes her boyfriend, Simon home to meet her parents on the occasion of her parents' 25th wedding anniversary, planning to reveal that they are engaged. However, what Theresa has also left out is that Simon is white......Actually it's not as bad as you'd think because Mac and Kutcher have great chemistry in the film. And the the fact that Theresa's boyfriend is White is nothing more than a parlour trick, distracting the viewer.The film is nothing more than the age old problem that fathers have when their daughters grow up, hoping that the man they marry will provide for them, and be able to step up when the going gets tough.And although some of the humour does ebb towards cultural references (the dinner scene is the lowlight of the film), it's charming enough just to get by with Mac getting on at Kutcher throughout the film.It's never going to be anything else but a background film, but there are a few funny moments.RIP Bernie Mac.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess Who (2005): Dir: Kevin Rodney Sullivan / Cast: Ashton Kutcher, Bernie Mac, Zoe Saldana, Judith Scott, Hal Williams: Expectations are surpassed in this routine comedy that takes the theme from Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and reverses it when a young black woman brings her white fiancée home to meet her folks. Simple setup works with a structure that is sitcom within its limited sets. Director Kevin Rodney Sullivan toys with modern culture. He does a terrific job at taking the situation from the 1967 film and reversing the odds. Where it goes wrong is the screenplay taking these themes and turning them into a situation sitcom where it relies on the leads to carry it. Ashton Kutcher plays off the nervousness of racial tension. He also quit his high profile job without informing his fiancée. Bernie Mac is hilarious as the father-in-law who suspects Kutcher as a fake and takes precautions. Despite their chemistry they are dealing with predictable formula. Zoe Saldana plays Kutcher's fiancée who is basically there to be pulled in two directions, get angry, then demand resolution. Judith Scott plays mother-in-law who is at best when she is cautioning Mac otherwise the role is standard issue. The film that apparently inspired this mishap was not a comedy and certainly hit harder with its theme. Who would have guessed that the remake would disappoint? Score: 4 / 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The concept of interracial couples isn't the easiest of topics to touch upon. Some individuals are open to idea and think it's a beautiful thing, while others think it shouldn't exist. It really all depends on how one is raised as a child. No one is born prejudice against anyone else, nor should anyone ever be taught to be that way. Unfortunately, the past is a hard thing to let go of. Thankfully though, in movie history, there have been films that break down these walls and expose to viewers this controversial topic. Simon (Ashton Kutcher), a Caucasian male and Theresa (Zoe Saldana), an African American female are an interracial couple. After being together for so long, they felt it was time for Simon to meet Theresa's family. To Simon's dismay, Theresa tells him that she did not tell her family, her father Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) especially, that he was Caucasian. And it's at this point where things get interesting and a tad dangerous. The film is comedic which is good, but this is also its flaw. Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), the original film that this film is based on, shows a few similarities but there's hunk of important material that was left out. The seriousness of the issue.Nowadays interracial couples are much more accepted into society than it has ever been before, but the way this topic is treated is slight bit overblown. Out of the three writers, the best one to handle the screenplay should have been Peter Tolan. David Ronn and Jay Scherick have the reputation of writing comedy driven screenplays that weigh heavily on one gag. It's not to say the comedy doesn't work but with a lack of seriousness in its tone, this topic could become a stereotype of itself. When it fact, the whole point of the film is to break down those stereotypes - not to reinforce it. That's the disappointing thing about this movie.Everything else about the movie works well though. Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana make a convincing interracial couple and Bernie Mac is good choice for an overprotective father. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac show the required chemistry to be likable on screen too. In fact Bernie Mac is the actor who carried around a lot of the weight in the film. The supporting cast also helps drive comedy and contains some of their own unique scenes. I enjoyed the small tracks that composer John Murphy installed into most the scenes. They were light, goofy, and it added to the overall tone. I enjoyed it. It has a good cast and fun laughs. I'm just curious if viewers prefer the realistic or comedic tone.Although the seriousness in tone is dropped, the comedy works well thanks to Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac's chemistry. However, the film does flip flop between realistic and stereotypical.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guess Who, which is a loose remake of the 1967 classic "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner", is a better film than I anticipated, but still not all that great. It's more of a mediocre film that has some good laughs at time and subtle chemistry between the two leads. All of these comedies that tend to be about race(black vs. white) are generally unfunny, but this film does have some funny moments.Kevin Sullivan's film is about a young couple named Theresa and Simon who just got engaged. Theresa takes her fiancée to meet her parents and they, especially her father, Percy is taken aback on how much different Simon is from them. That leads to tension and all sorts of fun things happening.The acting is not too shabby. As mentioned previously, the actors have some subtle chemistry. I always happened to be a fan of Bernie Mac so I was happy to see him here since he was the best thing about the movie. I'm not a fan of Ashton Kutcher and probably will never be, but I did feel sympathetic for his character.Overall, this is a decent movie if you can look past the racial themes and more unfunny moments than funny moments. That being said, there are some good jokes and my favorite scene is when Simon meets the grandfather for the first time around the dinner table. All-in-all, not a bad film but could have been better. I rate this film 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Racism sucks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not about comedy, this is not about great actors, this is a movie about racism. It must be stopped. I haven't watched many American movies dealing with racism this way. I wish racists watch this movie and try to get the answer why would they hate someone only because they are not from the same race. So what if our kids' partners are of a different race? Should we judge them just because of that? Should we make our kids suffer because we can't accept their choice? NO. Let's be happy no matter what our beloved ones choose to do, be with and find the happiness with. Be happy for them being happy. Racism is such a big world's problem, but I feel much better about the future when I see that someone is making this kind of movies. It can help. If only one person changes opinion about races this movie is worth of making.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I did wonder about the title when I heard about it, then I heard it was loosely based on the classic film Guss Who's Coming to Dinner, so I was certainly interested to see it, from director Kevin Rodney Sullivan (Barbershop 2: Back in Business). Basically Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) and wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are planning to renew their wedding vows, and at the same time their daughter Theresa (Avatar's Zoë Salda?a) is planning to bring home her boyfriend Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher). The parents had no idea that Theresa's boyfriend was white, and they certainly didn't know that they planned to tell them of their engagement plans during the weekend. The race issue complicates situations between Simon and his to-be father in law, Percy doesn't trust him, so much so that he looks into his past history, and he finds out he lost his job recently. He never told Theresa, and she is upset with both Simon for lying to her and her father for doing what he did, and so is Marilyn, both are ditched and have to come together to work things out. In the end. all relationships are restored, and the final scenes see Percy and Marilyn happily marrying again, and Simon and Theresa happy and looking forward to their future together. Also starring Hal Williams as Howard Jones, Kellee Stewart as Keisha Jones, Robert Curtis Brown as Dante and RonReaco Lee as Reggie. You could argue that this is pretty much a remake of the classic Spencer Tracy/Katharine Hepburn/Sidney Poitier film, just swapping the races round, but there are some big differences, like a more competitive rivalry between the black father and white guy, such as the racing scene, but that doesn't mean it is better, the original is obviously much more poignant, and this attempt to make it more funny doesn't quite work, but it is a romantic comedy worth a go once I suppose. Okay!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ebony and Ivory bomb</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Kutcher plays a merchant banker taken by his African-American fiancé to meet the parents ahead of their engagement announcement only to discover that her parents are unaware that he is white. Bernie Mac is the intimidating but essentially well-meaning father who initially discredits Kutcher for his lack of sporting prowess but gradually builds a mutual respect for his noble morality in spite of several embarrassing indiscretions.Inept picture is conceived on the basis of a one-joke premise that starts poorly and never recovers. This misfiring remake of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" borrows more than a little from "Meet the Parents" in its attempt to blend interracial social commentary with sentimental romance. Kutcher doesn't register on the laugh-ometer (he never recovers from the elevator scene, an absolute howler), and Mac makes maximum mileage out of his piercing glare and bulky frame, but it's a gag that quickly runs thin.The situations are contrived (the cross-dressing, sex act gag is a prime example of the weak set-ups) and most of the jokes fail at the punchline. Hal Williams as Mac's cantankerous father is perhaps the funniest aspect of this film, and the scene in which Kutcher digs his proverbial grave at the dinner table is for the most part very amusing, but it's a brief respite from the disappointment. If "Ebony &amp; Ivory" soundtrack gags still pass for humour, then I recant - otherwise, this remake should be retrospectively aborted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I absolutely loved this movie. I thought it was brilliant. And it delivers the one thing you would expect from a comedy: laughs. Time and time again.The cast was hilarious. Kutcher, Mac and Saldana had so much chemistry and it made the film work so splendidly. I didn't find anything racist about the movie as well, just some great jokes. And it showed that white people aren't the only racists. And the film wasn't a classical corny romantic comedy, it has a deeper meaning and message in it.I would recommend this movie to anyone. It makes you think about different problems starting with that love isn't always perfect, that people are different and everyone has to deal with problems concerning racism and family. I really enjoyed Guess Who. A magnificent film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"When Theresa (Zoe Saldana) brings fiancé Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) home for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary, she's neglected to mention one tiny detail? he's white. Determined to break his daughter's engagement, Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) does everything he can to make Simon feel 'apart' of the family, from running his credit report to locking him in the basement at night. But, when Percy gleefully exposes Simon's most embarrassing secret, it leads to an outrageous series of comic complications that only goes to prove that with a dad like Percy Jones, father doesn't always know best," according to the DVD sleeve description.You know, of course, that this situation is a reversal of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" (1967), wherein "black" Sidney Poitier is taken home to meet "white" Spencer Tracy and Katherine Hepburn. Those six shoes would be hard for any actor to fill, but, because this is more throwaway comedy than social commentary, the replacements do quite well. Wisely, the story is less about race than it is about relationships. Holding the film's threads together, Mr. Mac reacts as many fathers when confronted with his daughter's sexually interested boyfriend. Mac's relationship with Ms. Scott is nicely played; he and Mr. Kutcher have a winning chemistry.****** Guess Who (3/25/05) Kevin Rodney Sullivan ~ Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher, Zoe Saldana, Judith Scott</fullReview>

		<fullReview>So no it's not the best movie in the world and personally I don't think they claimed it to be. I don't also think they were actually trying (though I could be wrong) to fully remake the original "Guess who's coming to dinner". I think it was more of an inspiration. I think if people are going to go off and compare a movie then they don't need to watch it. Typically a remake isn't going to be as good as the original in most peoples eyes. Like many I found the movie predictable (like most) but I personally did find it funny! Its one of those movies that is fun to sit and watch with your friends :). I think it does have a good message as well. It's like a lot of movies, all movies have stemmed from something. Most romantics, dramas, action movies are all about the same, and typically end the same but yet we still watch them! I would say if you are an easy going person, you have a good sense of humor, you are not looking for some award academy winning film, just some fun watching a movie then this is the flick for you. If you are looking for something that is just blow your socks off funny then you might want to look else where.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie had me laughing all the way through it. Though Ashton Kucher is not my most favorite actor, he nailed this part as a white man trying to hard to fit in to his soon to be black family. Bernie Mac does a remarkable job of being the unaccepting father. The two combine for some very funny scenes. The racial overtones are handled in a very comedic and non-offensive manner. If you are trying to compare to another movie you must look at a cross between Meet the Parents and "Guess Who's coming to Dinner" with Sidney Potier. But, this movie is not a spoof, knock off, or a comedy in the gross out or dumb funny genre. This movie has a legitimate story and is funny along the way.

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly good</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story seems to be a tired remake of "Meet the parents" and the title led some people to think it is some kind of remake of "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner", which is not. While in the Stanley Kramer's movie race relations were the central focus, it's not really the case in "Guess who". It is really the same plot than in "Meet the parents" but with racial twist. People seem to consider that an heresy of some kind but honestly, if originality of the story was so important, Hollywood would produce 3 movies a decade, so I think this doesn't really matter as long as the treatment is noteworthy. In "Meet the Parents" the comedy is pure slapstick with some great clumsy Ben Stiller opposed to some pure De Niro tough man and this works throughout but this is just it: a good slapstick comedy. "Guess Who" tries something different but not totally, so I think a lot of people didn't like it because they couldn't put a label on this one : is it a slapstick comedy like "Meet the Parents" or is it a serious movie about race relations with a message like "Guess who's coming to Dinner?" ? Well, it's both and therefore for some I think this movie fails to deliver what they expected from it, hence the disappointment and the, in my opinion, low rating. But this is for me a strong point of this movie: it is not a one dimensional movie. Hollywood movies can be soooo boring because they never get out of the boundaries of the genre they belong to. A few ones work perfectly in their own categories (like "Dodgeball" for example as a slapstick comedy) but most can 't sustain perfection throughout and it makes them lame because they rely on nothing else. Hollywood Romantic comedies are the perfect example, they are usually so boring and childish because their characters have one dimension and the reactions of teenagers (I guess their targeted audience) and directors painfully explain every single little thing that anybody older than 12 know. Compare with some good korean romantic comedies for example ("My Sassy Girl", etc.) and you'll understand what I mean. So I must admit that "Guess Who" had, in my mind, a lot against itself, but it turns out as a rather good movie because it tries to be more than just a comedy, more than just a movie about race relations, and it's not directed and edited so primary school children can follow the plot. The director seems to have noticed that people have a brain and don't need to have everything spoon fed and that you can connect the dots (okay it's not "2001 Space Odyssey either).The movie is basically just a love story with the usual family complications, the race thing is an added twist that provides the writers with most of the comic material, so this is no Spike Lee movie, it doesn't address the issue, it just illustrates an example. Nevertheless, the most touching and dramatic scene is when Theresa (Zoe Soldana) tells her father "I'm scared. I know nowadays things have changed but you should really hear the kind of things that people tell us sometimes and the way they look at us". This nailed it for me. You can blablabla all you want about race relations, it all comes down to that. And just before there was a scene with Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and Theresa where they comment about him making a fool of himself by going one black joke too far and she says "This isn't us laughing at home about all this bullshit"... For those who have been in that situation, they know it all starts here, so thumbs up for that part.The rest is pretty good, with some weak parts here and there, like the "all black women scene" that, though not overdone, becomes tiresome. I mean, aren't American black women tired to be portrayed like that all the time? I'm not American, nor black, nor a woman either, but the ones I have met in my life, be it in KS, TX or elsewhere in the world were not all "I'm a princess, no I'm a queen, no I'm a goddess" kind of girls. It's funny when the Wayans are making fun of the "sistah attitude", but it seems this is the only way you'll see the (few) black women in Hollywood movies. I guess that's why I liked Zoe Soldana's part, she is a black girl that doesn't come across as helpless, selfish, oversensitive or manipulative. Unfortunately, it seems to be noteworthy...All in all, not a master piece, but a good comedy for a Saturday night with a few sparks that can make you start talking about its topic: choosing a spouse. 7/10 and a bonus point for showing a normal interracial relation, one that is not intrinsically dysfunctional.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie that offers absolutely nothing new. Even the racial jokes that Kutcher's character tells around the dinner table have been heard so many times before. The movie borrows and then oh so cleverly switches the premise of the Sidney Poitier drama "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" and uses the "Meet The Parents" template to make their movie. It doesn't work.This movie doesn't work fundamentally because this is movie making without any soul. It is what you might call a "movie by numbers". Bernie Mac is okay although he isn't utilised to his full comic potential and the much derided Ashton Kutcher does nothing to win over his critics although to be fair it would have been hard for anyone to have done any better with such lazy and uninspired material.On the front of the DVD box it said "If you liked 'Meet The Parents' - you'll love this" to which I say - Yes I did and no I didn't.</fullReview>

Bernie Mac plays the father of the daughter which Ashton Kutcher is dating and whose house at which they go to stay for the weekend leading up to the vows. It has the same mishaps including the car journey involving just Kutcher and Mac where De Niro turned on the radio and played Puff The Magic Dragon which led to the drug storyline of Stiller's character, in this movie the music played involves colours but again just clones the "Parents" plot.

		<fullReview>Guess Who starring Ashton Kutcher &amp; Bernie Mac is basically the same movie as Guess Who's Coming To Diner (1967)which starred Sidney Poitier &amp; Spencer Tracy but the only difference is that its reversed in colour. To be honest with you all I wasn't expecting much from this movie, mostly because of the bad reviews &amp; from what my mates have told me. It gets a little slow at times mostly due too the repetitive jokes &amp; remarks made by Bernie Mac. There are some scenes where you would laugh out loud, this is one of the fewer PG-13 rated movies that you can actually watch with the family. Overall the movie had a pretty good meaning to it but it all could've been done a little better by putting a few more jokes in it to make it a better comedy. To make a long short Simon Green (Kutcher) &amp; Theresa Jones (Saldana) are an interracial couple Theresa wants to introduce (Kutcher) to her family but hasn't told them he's white, basically Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) starts to test his patience &amp; how honest he really is.

		<shortDescription>A movie that had nowhere to go</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guess Who skipped the drama elements of the movie it's loosely based on ( Guess Who's Coming To Dinner ), in order to be a comedy hit. The problem is that in the last 4 years, we've seen 2 ( better ) movies that were about the same concept. So I think Guess Who had nowhere to go from the beginning.Guess Who tells the story of Simon Green ( Ashton Kutcher ), who has to meet the parents of his girlfriend Theresa ( Zoe Saldana ). The problem is that Theresa's father Percy ( Bernie Mac ) is not the nicest person on earth. What makes it worse is that Simon is white while Theresa is black.Guess who started really well. Actually after the first half hour, I thought this was going to be as good as the Meet The Parents movies.After the good start, the film starts to repeat a lot of things that were done in The Meet Parents movies. The go cart racing ( vs car racing in Meet The Parents ) , the football playing, making the boyfriend sleep in another bed, were all done, in a funnier way before. Therefore I thought the middle part of the movie was really boring. Fortunately, the last 20 minutes were good enough to restore my interest in the movie.This movie was not made to discuss the issues that Guess Who's Coming To Dinner Discussed. Nevertheless, i was surprised that the white-black issue was limited to only one scene, where Simon starts telling jokes about black people. I think that if this issue was treated better, it would have given the movie some needed depth. That depth would have helped the movie not become a second hand Meet The parents. With the way the movie was made, Percy was always going to have a problem with Simon, whether he was black or not.Ashton Kutcher &amp; Bernie Mac were good, although they delivered better performances before.So overall, I don't recommend watching Guess Who. You can watch the original or The Meet The Parents movies, and you'll have a better time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A light-hearted remake of Stanley Kramer's 1967 classic "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner" has young white-collar worker Ashton Kutcher getting engaged to African American photographer Zoe Saldana. Of course the only thing left to do is meet Saldana's parents (super calm mother Judith Scott and highly suspicious father Bernie Mac). Naturally Mac steals the show as the whole development puzzles and bothers him with hilarious results as he and Kutcher lock horns on more than one occasion. The original was a powder keg drama that did indeed have some comedy, but the social and moral messages were the picture's calling cards and that fact made it an American cinematic classic. To compare this production with its inspiration is not really fair. This movie goes for comedy and the drama takes the backseat. The social and moral messages are still clear and mean a lot in 2005 as well. Not a great movie, but I still enjoyed it anyway. As with Spencer Tracy in the 1967 version, Bernie Mac dominates as his character has the most depth and complexity. There are a slew of films that fail where this one succeeds. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A lackluster comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guess Who is a light comedy that isn't without it's occasional charms, but for the most part is a predictable formula film with little or no surprises to offer most any audience member that has been watching movies for a few years. It doesn't have to be stellar, but it has to have more energy than this.Based on the title, some might think this is a remake of the 1960's film Guess Who's Coming to Dinner? That film featured a similar situation, where a family has to adjust to the daughter bringing home a black boyfriend. Aside from the premise, Guess Who doesn't borrow much from the aforementioned film, and instead feels more like a remake of Meet the Parents. Simon (Ashton Kutcher) is a successful stock broker who is currently dating, and living with, Theresa (Zoe Saldana), who's father, Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), has a reputation for being rather harsh with his daughter's boyfriends. It doesn't help the situation that Simon is White and Theresa is black, not to mention the fact that Simon has just quit his job to make a point to his boss, and one of Percy's pet peeves is that his daughter's boyfriends have gainful employment. Upon arriving at Percy's home for a weekend where Percy and his wife Marilyn (Judith Scott) are planning to renew their wedding vows, things quickly being to go wrong. Simon lies to Percy about his love of Nascar to stop Percy's nagging about not being interested in sports, and also finds himself sharing a bed with Percy in the basement to ensure no hanky-panky is going on between Simon and Theresa.If there is one thing Guess Who does well, it's to create a fairly strong family setting that the Jones family has created. It seems that Percy genuinely cares for his family, especially his daughters, and Bernie Mac does a good job of selling Percy as a protective, but caring, father. However, the script goes through some rather familiar motions that leaves little room for any surprises as the film progresses. Simon and Percy lock horns almost immediately, and it seems as if there is nothing Simon can do right or that doesn't turn bad for him. The character of Marilyn seems supportive, as is often the formula, and she also clashes with her bullheaded husband over his treatment of Simon. This eventually leads to some rather expected heartfelt talks and melting of ice later on, but it can all be seen miles in advance.When you know what is going to happen like the back of your hand, then a film like this had better deliver the goods in the joke department. However, Guess Who is a rather lackluster comedy. There are a few amusing scenes and good jokes along the way, and the actors are doing their best, but Guess Who is simply not that funny. It can offer up a few good chuckles, but no riotous scenes to speak of. This is especially disappointing in its waste of Bernie Mac's talent. He is perfect for this kind of role, but the script doesn't give him much funny to do.As for the rest of the cast, they are capable, and Ashton Kutcher is notable for one of his better, straighter performances to date, but they also aren't really helped much by the script. In the end, Guess Who is one of those films that is mildly entertaining while you watch it, but is quickly banished from memory shortly after it is over.</fullReview>

Also Theresa(i forgot her normal name) and Marilyn(i forgot her real name to) are really good actors and there really pretty. Everyone says i look like theresa which i do.(don't mean to brag!!!!!)

		<shortDescription>Great Beginning, Awful Conclusion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In New York, the Afro-American Theresa Jones (Zoë Salda?a) goes to the suburb of New Jersey with her Caucasian boy-friend Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) for the renewal of the vows of her parents after twenty-five years marriage. Her father, the racist banker Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), does not accept the white Simon and does not give a break to Simon. In the end, love is beautiful, and all the family problems are fixed.Although having the theme "visiting the family", which is very explored in comedies by Hollywood, the beginning of "Guess Who" is funny, with many hilarious racist situations. I laughed a lot, for example, with the confusion of Percy with the cab driver in the arrival of Simon to his house; or with the stupid dialogs of Simon with Percy, making the situations worse and worse. There are some jokes at the grandfather's dinner table that I did not understand (for example, the joke with the "ho" sister). Bernie Mac is simply perfect in the role of a very racist black man, and Aston Kutcher is very good in the role of an impulsive young guy that does not think before speaking. Indeed his character is too much silly to be a good and disputed professional in business. Unfortunately, in a certain moment the story become boring and corny, certainly for commercial interests in order to have a politically correct conclusion. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): "A Família da Noiva" ("The Family of the Bride")</fullReview>

It shows that to people from very different backgrounds can fall in love. This movie will make you laugh your socks off. I absolutely recommend you rent this movie and watch it with your family or by yourself. Anyway Bernie and Ashton are the most hilarious couple to appear in a comedy/ romance movie ever. This movie i have almost no words to say it was so funny. um... I don't think i would have seen this movie if any other actors were acting in it. The director couldn't have picked a more hilarious couple.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Surprisingly misogynistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie expecting a light-hearted comedy. I enjoyed the additional complexity added to the characters played by Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. Both actors did an excellent job in their roles, playing the characters realistically rather than over-the-top. Mac and Kutcher are definitely the highlight of this film.This film addresses the issue of race, particularly the interaction between whites and blacks in the U.S. Such is an inflammatory topic and the filmmakers deserve credit for tackling the topic without partisanship. It is played for comedic effect at times but ultimately is treated with respect.But I was disappointed that the female characters in the film were written as manipulative and deceptive. Whereas the arc involving Bernie Mac shows a man struggling to come to grips with the conflict between his love for his daughter and his feelings on race, the female characters are shown as conniving and inauthentic. This surprisingly misogynistic message clashes with the tone of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth the time or the money...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film, which (from title to premise) is drawing heavily on the original _Guess Who's Coming to Dinner_, had a lot of potential. The story concept, although not new, is one that could be freshened up and put back into the public eye -- it is as relevant today as it was when Sydney Poitier did it the first time.Unfortunately, the film cannot seem to identify itself. It cannot seem to decide if it wants to be a tender dramatic tale with comedic elements, or a goof-ball comedy with tender elements. This gives the film a disjointed feel that distracts from what little story is actually there.The film also seems to draw (read: "steal") much of the worst parts of _Meet the Parents_ at the same time. And as if this is not enough to kill this film, the acting is sub-standard; the story does not flow; and at least three story elements are introduced that are never spoken of again, never coming to fruition.In other words: it is best to avoid this thing. It is really not worth the time or the money.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See Guess Who's Coming To Dinner Instead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm gonna put it like this, for those who haven't seen Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, plain and simple...WATCH THAT MOVIE FIRST AND LEAVE IT AT THAT!!!!!! The actors in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner acted brilliantly, it's a CLASSIC film. Not only was it HILARIOUS, it was very touching and real as well. Sadly, 38 years later, they had the nerve to remake a classic comedy like Guess Who's Coming To Dinner and reverse racial roles. Guess Who. was far from hilarious. First off if you saw the original, you never saw Sidney Poitier in the same bed as Spencer Tracy, nor in the same bedroom for that matter. Guess Who was the opposite. In the original, all the parents met. In Guess Who, Ashton only mentions what his mom and grandma said about his future fiancée. Sidney never ever argued with his fiancée and then had the nerve to be desperate and sing horribly to get her back (not to mention make 35 cell phone calls). The most distasteful thing about Guess Who was the fact that they had to make a bunch of racial jokes with the black actors laughing. There was only one instance in Guess Who when Isabel Sanford called Sidney Poitier the N-word, but that was once. The fact is Guess Who was the WORST movie Bernie Mac ever starred it and it's a poor excuse for a remake. Guess Who's Coming To Dinner was a classic, pure, hilarious comedy without all the filth and sex-related humor, Guess Who was the opposite, PLAIN AND SIMPLE and that's it, ENOUGH SAID!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Telling it like it is with heart</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I realize right off the bat that my 10 mark looks a bit to high. I admit it, this movie should really be something like an eight, but I have a specific marking style. You see, every film I see starts with a 10. If while I'm seeing it I can come up with something I would have done to make it better if I were making it then I take off a point. So, I say, "I would have had better character development," there goes one point out the window for the film.If I can't think of a way that the film can be improved then it's kind of dumb if I start taking off points. Even if I didn't like the film, there is no way they could have made it any better.With this film I can't honestly come up with a way to improve it so it gets a 10. Also, I really enjoyed it, so that's always a plus. ;) Once again Bernie Mac finds himself in a pretty series/drama film, but this time, unlike with the film Mr. 3000, there is a lot of comedy. Now, remember this film is trying to be a drama above all, so even though there is a lot of comedy and you will chuckle quite a bit from time to time it never really reaches the you laughing your head off level so it can keep itself as the series film it needs to be. Now, that isn't to say there aren't a lot of over the top gags. There's tones of them. But, I found that most of the time they were down played and even though they were a bit out there they were still understandable scenes. So, this is not the funniest film you will see, but it's cute and it also has something else going for it.Yes, this is yet another remake. Maybe before you sit down to see this film you should try to brain wash yourself into thinking that this film is the first of its kind. I think it's more enjoyable that way. We're all a bit sick of the remakes.Well, anyways, the plot is this, Simon Green(Ashton) has just quit his job and is now meeting with Percy Jones(Bernie Mac) his soon to be father in law. Percy is a bigot, and proud of it. Needles to say he is not impressed with Simon being white, and not only that, but he soon clicks into the fact that Simon is lying about something, namely him quiting his job, and Percy starts his quest to expose Simon for the fraud that he is.We've all seen films before where they turn racial differences into a joke. Well, this is the other thing that the film has going for it. You see, with most of those other films they over do things and make it seem that everyone in a specific race loves rap and hip hop. Well, this just isn't true. This movie does not make fun of the groups that are being mistreated by racism. It does not turn them into the but of the joke by having them use countless hip hop terms and trying to be cool. It makes fun of racism itself. The insult becomes the but of the joke in this film and I couldn't be happier. Ashton doesn't come off as the white stereotype and Bernie doesn't come off as the black stereotype. They come off as regular Joes. In fact Bernie even reminded me of my dad at times. So the film is realistic in this sense and quite enjoyable in this sense to.Also, the film kind of tells it like it is, but it's a heart filled drama/comedy so it will never bring you down. Things that it points out to be true is that love isn't perfect and there is no happy ending, life is just on going, and there will always be racism and that we are just going to have to deal with it, like it or not. These themes are very true and illustrated well in the film. All you can do is kind of nod in agreement and then smile at the fact that the film still shows off the happier side of life.It's true that Bernie and Ashton play the same character they always do, so you wouldn't really want to call them very good actors, but hey, they are enjoyable and likable characters. They make the film.Well anyways, it had heart and was very enjoyable, so ya, a 10 fits well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>waste of time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I went to this movie under the impression that this was a comedy. "A fun lark of a movie" is what we were hoping for on a Friday night. Whoa! We were quite wrong. It was uncomfortable and boring. Uncomfortable like watching "Meet the Parents" where EVERYone and everything in this movie was set up to make Ashton's character feel awkward. Boring - to the point where I found myself looking down and staring at the empty chair in front of me rather than watch the staged events on screen.There was no chemistry or apparent love between Ashton and his fiancé and no chemistry or apparent romance between Bernie Mac and his wife - who were renewing their vows at a party when the kids come home to stay with them. It was confusing because you could tell some scenes were meant to be "laugh out loud" but we found ourselves just staring at the screen shaking our heads.The sad part is... we rarely (2-3 times per year) go to the movies anymore because the prices are so high ($9.50 each tonight) and the movies are usually disappointing. Out of 20 movies at this multiplex, THIS was the movie that looked best to us? We're going to stick with Netflix. The only good part of the evening, besides when the credits starting running and we were thinking "that's it?", was that we had gift cards to see this movie, and got cash back when we paid for our tickets. So it was a waste of time, but at least we got paid for our time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A daughter brings her boyfriend home to meet the parents to announce their engagement. Problem is her family is black, her boyfriend, Simon Green (Kutcher),is white and she hasn't told them.The funny stuff was shown a million times in the promos. And, I can only remember two of those times, but they were pretty good. When I got to see the movie, that funny stuff wasn't as funny as before, and the rest of the movie was filled with tired old jokes, bad dialog, and an overpowering black father, Percy Jones (Mac). No one stood out except for Bernie Mac. He had all the good lines and overpowered everything, and no one challenged him. Now, that is okay, up to a point, and he did have cause to be upset -- his daughter brings home a white guy without telling anyone. But, Percy says he is more upset that Simon is hiding something and not that Simon is white.Kutcher brought absolutely nothing to the table and he should hope That 70s Show and that other one he is involved aren't canceled. The mother (Judith Scott), and daughter (Zoe Saldana) had muted lines that are good enough for family TV, but no more than that. Oh, the acting was good, but the dialog suffered all throughout in that it was too bland. That is, the dialog suffered except for Bernie Mac's lines. Some were pretty good.Yes, this has similarities to Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, Meet the Parents, Meet the Fockers, but those shows, while not all that funny, were, at least, not bland. Okay, Guess Who's Coming To Dinner was nervously funny because of the time it played??years ago...in the 1960s, I believe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After 10 Min's every body knows what's going to happen at the end of film. That's okay with me nowadays you can find large number of these films in Hollywood and some of them are pretty good, but there is something you can't be sure of at the end of this film. you will wondering would someone come out of the screen and tell you get punk'd. They really want you to laugh at their jokes, but all you get from this film is headache caused by waiting for the ending. the old meet the parents techniques wasn't help Ashton this time and trying to be nice, innocent, cute and white boy just made it worst. The film also has some basic logical problem with story. It seems at the end of the film director forget about them completely. For example Simon looking for money to buy some stocks and he told his friend to put it on the order. He doesn't have any money , unemployed and promised his friend to give him the money till next Thursday. After this scene you will hear nothing about this event at all. Simply let's forget it. just imagine this part and I wont say a word about this film anymore. You sit on a bench in railway station alone. You are deeply sad and because you are such a good boy you can't do anything to disturb your lovely wife and her family. Suddenly your father in law come to you and told you he knew why you quit your high class job and you say really??? And he replies yes your boss told you not to marry this black girl!!!"Guess who" is the worst film I have ever seen in father of the bride category.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie sucks.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The reason I rented this movie from Blockbuster, was I wanted to watch a 'soft' romantic-comedy movie, and because I have similar experience where my Black mom is not properly accepted by my dad's White family. In other words, it's racial theme, and how I identified with it, was what attracted me to watch this movie. However, the 'genre' of the film is a 'comedy' and not a 'drama', so if expecting some sort of dramatic theme with a deep treatment on the subject, you will be very disappointed.As a romantic-comedy - it's merits is whether it is 'funny', and if it had any 'magical moments' or 'touching scenes', what would seem 'romantic. In terms of comedy I personally did not find the movie funny - it seemed very predictable, and there were no surprise's. However, there were black jokes and the 'obvious' hypocrisy of the Black family seemed remotely amusing. In terms of the 'romantic' it seems to be an inferior version of the 'Meet the Parents' series, only with a racial twist. It seemed to be a Hollywood money-maker (or a B-type movie).On a positive note, there was no real swearing, violence, and nobody getting hurt of blown-up and no drugs or sex. However, I usually take away points if these are present as opposed to adding points if they are absent.I do not recommend buying, renting this film unless you can borrow it for free at the library or watch it on TV.</fullReview>

And to make this movie even more crap, it represented thoughts that i hate, like feminism ("remember my son, woman is always right"), wannabe not-a-racist (this theme is past a long while), idiotic jokes for people with intelligence below forest gump.This one is definitely masterpiece.

That movie, starring the late Spencer Tracy in his last role, the late Katherine Hepburn and Sidney Poiter dealt with the issue of race as real people would do. The original was made during a time of racial tensions in this country. Tracy's moving speech at the end of the original 1967 movie brought it all together for me.Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher do not deal with race seriously. This movie is not about social justice like the original. The jokes are not funny. Mac seems too grouchy and Kutcher is not funny. Kutcher's girlfriend and Mac's wife do not seem like real people. This movie has no soul and for a rental it was money poorly spent.</fullReview>

And the race thing was turned into a huge deal in this movie, and it actually became the focus of the film for a good matter of time. I was surprised. The movie will go from comedy to portraying racial issues in society. It's an awkward movie and at times you simply won't feel comfortable in your seat.

		<fullReview>I never saw a movie like this. How original! This movie will create a brand new genre of movie. We will now call it "interracial buddy" movie. Imagine the concept we will put a white guy and a black guy together. Yes, that's right! Two different races will be put together in one movie. Guess what? The movie will start with each other hating each other, mostly hating each other based on skin color. By the end of the movie they will become buddies. They will learn that no matter what the skin color, the other is human, just like them. Oh what a celebration of diversity this is. I could never imagine Hollywood making a movie like this. All I have to say is WOW! Now let me stop kidding around, because I guarantee people will respond "Is he serious?" I hate this tired formula. I want to see a movie where two men of different races are put together, and they hate each other in the beginning all the way to the end. I think that is why "Do the Right Thing" was so successful. The climax of that movie was intolerability toward ethnic diversity. The movie climaxed into an explosion of differences. I like the idea of a movie pointing out that diversity leads to trouble. Why do we have to accept diversity in America? I don't want to. I am very ethnocentric. I know it's wrong, (according to American society), but I feel like I should have the right to have opinions and thoughts, even if they contradict what is perceived as correct.I know this is only a damn movie, and I am taking it way too serious. I think what triggered this rant is the lame formula and thoughts of double standards. If a white boy is brought home to meet a girlfriend's black parents, it's a comedy, (yuck up the differences). If a black boy is brought home to meet a girlfriend's white parents, it's a drama (condemning bigotry and prejudice). More than anything, I think I am just sick of formulaic Hollywood movies dealing with white and black people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who, should be renamed Guess What, This Is A Really Lame Movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Or Guess What Could Be Career Sucide For Ashton Kuthcer. It is clear that he cannot act, he is just a personality, he is not famous for his acting, It is his presence in the film. But his performance in this film was about has annoying as his performance in Cheaper By The Dozen. And the women seem to get immense pleasure making a fool out of the Bernie Mac character, even Judith Scott,the woman playing his wife in the film. And now I wished Queen Latifah would have come out, and kicked all there butts. I feel bad for Bernie Mac, he really is the only who is funny, but his effort comes up short, as the story just get really lame has it goes on. I can't really comment on Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, cause I didn't see it. But I'm sure it was a better film, then this remake/spoof. This movie was about as annoying as Paris Hilton. I'd probably go crazy if had to sit through this movie again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Never intended to see this film but didn't want to disappoint my friends. Went in with extremely low expectations and was absolutely right. The movie is very predictable with the formula we have seen thousands of times before. A nice black girl brings home a white guy to meet her parents. Ashton Kutcher plays the part of the boyfriend Simon Green. Don't get me wrong but does anyone else think that Ashton Kutcher cannot act? Every time I see him in a film, he seems to portray very similar characters. I never felt any chemistry between him and his girlfriend. Bernie Mac who plays an overprotective father goes out of his ways not to like Simon from the start. The jokes are not very funny and at times offensive. Supposedly, this was a remake of a 1967 movie "Guess who is coming to dinner". I cannot comment on the original movie since I have not seen it but I sure hope it was a much better film. 3/10 for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't horrible, don't get me wrong. However, if you are going out to see a good romantic-comedy type movie I would suggest something else. Hitch for example. 'Hitch' is everything this movie is not. It is funny, fast paced, with great chemistry between actors, and a good leading male in Will Smith. 'Guess Who' however was incredibly predictable and slow moving at times. While there were a lot of "funny" parts in the movie, there was nothing in it that I laughed out loud at. The jokes were forced out for the most part, and the actors looked like they were going through the motions. There didn't seem to be much chemistry between the the leading male and female in this. At no point did I feel I was looking at real characters. I just felt I was seeing Bernie Mac playing the role of the father, and Ashton playing the 'boyfriend'. Ashton was silly while trying to be funny, which is his style and personality. But he was unconvincing and awkward while trying to be serious. Ashton is just in over his head with this kind of acting. He was in his element with the show 'Punked', and 'Dude Where's my Car?'.In short, this is one I would suggest waiting to see on video. If you were thinking of a good evening out, I would suggest Hitch or go with a totally different genre of movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know the movie was supposed to be humorous, but i found it rude and extremely racist towards white people. If there were a comedy made like this but the roles were reversed where it was a black man dating a white woman and he was meeting her white family for the first time and if the white family were treated him the way they treated the white man in this movie it would be severely frowned upon and not humorous at all. Although, because its a white man going into a black family were supposed to look at it as humorous? I think its unfair and disrespectful. I'm sure it would be very much frowned upon but when its the way this movie is everyone expects you to laugh at the racism of white people. Its wrong, i do not like this movie at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Heres an idea for this kind of movie- instead of the guy who's about to meet his girlfriends parents being a spineless wimp who really wants to be accepted by his future in laws, how about a movie where the guy actually has enough courage to stand up for himself, and tell his future father in law that hes not gonna put up with stuff like being hooked up to a lie detector or sleeping in the same bed with him? Another question- how come none of the characters like Bernie Mac's from this movie have ever been accused of incest ? For most of this movie Simon Green is such a pushover that he really does not make a sympathetic character. Bernie Mac basically just plays the same arrogant character he always does.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A slight but very sweet film, greatly enhanced by the likable stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Theresa (Zoe Saldana) is becoming very close to her boyfriend, Simon (Ashton Kutcher). They live in Manhattan, where Simon is a rising businessman, and an engagement between the two of them may be forthcoming. However, Simon has never met Theresa's folks. But, an introduction is about to occur, as Theresa is taking Simon home for the weekend, where her parents are hosting a big party to celebrate their anniversary. There is one small glitch. Simon is a Caucasian and Theresa is an African-American and the young woman's parents have not been told about this detail. Needless to say, Theresa's father, Percy (Bernie Mac), mother and sister are surprised to meet Simon face to face. As such, Percy has his misgivings and insists that the young couple can not occupy the same room. In addition to that, after Simon is installed in the basement bedroom, Percy makes it clear that he will sleep WITH Simon to make certain that there is no midnight rendez-vous. Oh, boy! In truth, everyone is so stressed about the party arrangements and the family's reactions to Simon that the celebration almost gets cancelled. Will everyone learn to love one another? This is a slight but very sweet film, loosely based on the classic Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. It's sad that, almost 40 years later, the film's premise is still relevant but it is. To the writers' credit, the movie does not shy away from truth and meaning, although the plot is somewhat thin. But, it is the film's cast that is the movie's greatest asset. Mac is a very humorous and likable star and so is Kutcher. Get those two together and you have a dynamic duo of comedy, helping to overcome any of the movie's weaker elements. The rest of the players, including Saldana, are also very worthy. As for the film's costumes, sets, and production values, they are quite nice indeed. If you love romantic comedies or are fans of Mac or Kutcher, get yourself a copy of this one. It's this viewer's guess that you will be very pleased with the final result.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess Who is a funny comedy that Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac are hilarious in separately and as a team. The movie is about a guy who has to face mans worst dream, meeting his fionseys parents and to make matters worse they are black and he is white. This movie is very light hearted and is done really well with Ashton Kutchers character being the silly one and Bernie Mac being the serious one. This movie is good for many reasons 1. It has all the laughs you could want from a movie like this, 2. It does the black/white thing in a responsible way and do not get too racist or stuff like that, 3. It is very understandable and does not lose meaning. Overall I think this movie is very underrated and a must see for movie Goa's every where. So I rate it 84%.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wasn't keen on seeing this one, as I am not a Bernie Mac fan, nor am I a fan of Ashton Kutcher, but I have to admit, this film is more entertaining than I anticipated.Simon (Kutcher) is going to meet his fiancé's family. The family has not been told that Simon is white. Mayhem, racist jokes, and stereotypical clichés ensue.Above that, though, is a sweet rom/com. IF, that is, you can get beyond the racial slurs and bigoted behaviors of the beginning to enjoy the later "unity." I could, though with difficulty. If nothing else, it shows how fast things deteriorate when lies (even by omission) come into play in any relationship.It is mildly entertaining (which is more than I hoped for) although predictable throughout. You can see what Bernie Mac's leading up to, where Kutcher's character is going, and what the ending will be, from the beginning.There's better things to do with your time, but it is a decent rom/com...sort of.It rates a 5.4/10 from...the Fiend :.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sometimes stays as a great Meet the Parents type of movie, but then sometimes goes too far</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>But I shouldn't really complain, I knew what I was getting into when I wanted to borrow this movie from my friend. I think that's why this movie doesn't have a top rating, people are probably judging on the situation alone and hating it, but actually I think along with a few others, that this is a very important situation in today's society, a biracial relationship. Only the director seemed to take a comedic turn on it, which wasn't a bad idea, it just seemed to take a turn into bad taste.Basically, Ashton Kutcher plays Simon Green, a young successful man who just quit his job at J.B. Oliver due to "disagreements" that play an important part of the story later, and he's in a very healthy and loving relationship with a woman, Theresa Jones. When he's about to meet her father, she fails to mention to her parents that Simon is white, while her mother doesn't mind it so much, her father, Percy, played by Bernie Mac, is having a few problems with it. He even has suspicions that Simon isn't honest and won't treat his daughter with the respect she deserves, not to mention he worries about the future of biracial kids and the looks.Of course, we have a little bit of the cliceed ending, but you'll have to see it, believe me, it wasn't that bad. I did like this movie on a few notes, it had some pretty cute moments. I did love the scene where Percy stays in bed with Simon just to protect his daughter, and the dinner scene with the "black jokes" was painful to watch, but still I think that some people could really get into this. If you enjoyed "Meet the Parents", you could get into "Guess who?".6/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The main reason I watch the movie cause it does look alright in the trailer; plus it also got Ashton and Bernie. Unfortunately this movie is nothing more than about the racial discrimination about the white boy tries to blend in with the black family - The kind of stuff that you normally see when the director and writer is an African American, cause that all they seem to think of.The story is nothing that you haven't seen before zillion of times; however I don't mind that, but to used the exact same joke as other movie that is totally bad. Came to think of it, it is the exact same situation as one episode of Fresh Prince of Bel Air. This movie is rip-off from Fresh Prince. It rip-off all the same comedic situations from there, plus all the characters personality, and the style of the movie is too alike. The worst part is it is not even close to as good as Fresh Prince.Everything about this movie is way too average, though I did get a smirk 3-4 times I am not sure if that is enough or worth your time and money on watching this movie again. It is like those useless comedies movie that Ashton did before this. My advices - if you like his previous then watches it but if you don't, don't bother about it.Reason To Watch: Ashton and Bernie Battling It Out.Reason Not To: It Is Nothing That You Haven't Seen Before.Rating: 4/10 (Grade: D-)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Guess Who" is a comic remake of the 1967 classic "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner." This time,the story is in the reverse as a Caucasian (Ashton Kutcher) wants to marry a black girl.Bernie Mac steals the movie as the girl's father. Due to the story line, the sequences in the film become highly predictable. Naturally, the parents are about to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary. Naturally, there has to be a falling out which of course has to be resolved.Just before the engagement is to be announced, Kutcher loses his investment job when he quits. The boss isn't thrilled about the pending inter-racial nuptials.There is some stereotyping in the film. The girl hides the fact that her boyfriend is white and Mac tells everyone that the guy is a black man named Jamal who went to Harvard and is now a doctor.Whether its 1967 or 2006, there is still a lot of sensitivity regarding inter-racial couples. The pictures tries to bridge all that but we come away with the feeling that we've seen a lot of this before.</fullReview>

I expected a bit more on Bernie Mac, even though I'm not that fond of him either, but at least you always counted on him being funny most of the time. That's not the case in "Guess Who". The story wasn't organized nor did it make sense. I expected Ashton to be a disappointment, but I didn't think the whole movie would be that bad. Definitely not worth the time, effort, or money to see this movie. Find something else that can give you an actual laugh and not a tickle.</fullReview>

Her mother accepts it while her father can complain so much about it. Now, Simon (the white man) has to make his girlfriend's father think that he's good enough for her. This is a loose remake from the original Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. This is a funny movie but not as funny as I expected. The trailer looks hilarious but that's maybe all the good jokes there.

		<fullReview>To say that i had any expectations from this movie would be saying to much. The truth is i only guessed the theme of the movie when i put this movie in a DVD player. And i must say its been another one of those movies you end up loving just because it exceeds all your expectations (in this case 0).The first thing that struck me about this movie was the lack of chemistry between the young lead actors kutcher and saldana. But the thing is I've never seen kutcher have any real chemistry with any girl on screen so that doesn't count for much.5 min into the movie i guessed what it was all about and thats the best part of the movie.You know whats in store for you and even then you love it. I expected the Loud Super Black Guy, I expected the bumbling white guy, i expected the tension between them and the black guy white guy jokes and stereotypes and by God i got everyone of them and i loved it.The few scenes that were brilliant and surprised me though was the dinner table scene with the racist jokes that scene was brilliant and even though i didn't laugh that hard i loved it.And as a person who frequently dishes out and is at the receiving end of racists jokes this movie makes me believe in the importance at laughing at oneself.That said this movie has a humorous look at an otherwise relevant topic and not just in the US but in my country India as well. Intercaste and inter-community marriages are always awkward and being from a family that had its first inter-community marriage in 2 centuries i can identify with the humour in this film.From the American point of view i somehow feel that its now the Black people who are far more racists then the Americans especially in the urban areas and i have seen a similar state in my country where the castes that were earlier on the receiving end of caste-ism are now their greatest practitioners.With that in mind this movie gets full credit at twisting the original (where the white girl gets the black guy home) and making this film.The acting of this movie was top notch and although Aston may not have good chemistry with his female costars he shared great chemistry with Bernie mac (whos made a career playing the Quintessential Black Guy) who a little over the top in a few scenes but in comedies i guess its OK.All in all a great film if you don't expect much and are willing to have a funny outlook on a relevant topic, which leaves you laughing during the film and thinking afterwords.Watch this film.</fullReview>

I mean I am a guy that can't not smoke for 28 minutes; who can't stay on a diet for 28 days; well, you get the idea. 28 years is a long time and I don't know how I managed to do it.Anyway, I selected Guess Who. Now, I cannot imagine what made me think that anyone could remake a movie that starred Spencer Tracy, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Hepburn; much less one starring Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher. The trick is that you have to not compare the actors and just enjoy the movie. It was an enjoyable update of the previous classic, and it had some great moments, especially when they were talking about being complete: "That's just it, she's everything I'm not. You know, she's my other half. Without her I'm not whole. You know the thing about meeting your other half is you're walking around, you think you're happy, you think you're whole, then you realize you ain't sh*t without her. Then you can't go back to being just a half 'cause you know what it's like to be whole." Yes, that's what 28 years is all about.</fullReview>

His love for Theresea, whom he is engaged to, is never convincing. Ashton had no chemistry with Zoe Saldana, who played Thersea. The film is not convincing as to why Simon loves Theresea. Bernie Mac was a little better, but his character is not well written either. The jokes revolve too much about racism. Like Percy gives Simon a hard time just because he's white. And he wants Simon to tell off-color jokes at the dinner table. This is what is supposed to be laughs, but I don't find those kind of jokes funny. They are such a cop out. They are more like jokes from a stand up comedy act instead of a movie. And there was nothing original about this.FINAL VERDICT: Ashton Kutcher is a disappointment.

'He's married to Demi Moore, right?' But with this movie ... the love ... it just wasn't there and that is what I found most disappointing. From this movie I just got the feeling that he wasn't into black women and there is nothing wrong with us!

This is a terrible film, all the more so because it's put together just well enough to stop you leaving the room. You keep waiting for the next scene hoping that it will be just a little bit funnier and it never is. Ashton Kutcher is dire and everyone else, apart from Bernie Mac, merely competent. But even Bernie can't flog this dead horse back to life, because for that, you need a good script. No script, no movie, I thought that was one of the things they taught at film school. Apparently not. What made them think that a blatant and shameless rip-off of a decent film would work when they don't even include a little inventiveness? For inventiveness, read original and fresh gags, situations etc. Their "Big Idea" was to put it in a racial context, the reverse of the one depicted in "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner." That's all. That's the only thing they thought of by themselves. How very original. Don't waste your time with this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It takes some courage to do a remake after a classic staring Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn and Sidney Poitier. That memorable movie was belonging to a very different time, when movies like 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' and 'In the Haat of the Night' were bringing to the screen the echos of the civil rights fights. Now, the remake is reduced to a good-feeling comedy, and one cannot really feel some kind of disappointment, not because it's a bad movie, but because it waters down the subject of the inter-racial relations to a degree that is exaggerated even for a comedy.Although based on a rather incredible pretext, the story has some fun and rhythm, the characters interact well, we get a few laughs from the comic of the situations. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac are the real couple in the movie, and their chemistry builds as the the relationship on the screen builds up. The problem lies in the exaggerated caution the script and the pain that is evident in every scene and dialog to obey the rules of the politically correct. The final result is that we feel somehow cheated, because there are still problems out there that this film completely ignored in order to make us feel well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered-Down Comedy Has Warmth But Lacks Genuine Relevance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To say this movie is not as bad as I was anticipating is actually my way of complimenting director Kevin Rodney Sullivan for his patently inoffensive, occasionally perceptive update of 1967's "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner". Whereas Stanley Kramer's earlier film is often lambasted for deifying its principal character, the esteemed, tragically widowed black doctor portrayed by Sidney Poitier, the race-reversed 2005 film goes the opposite route by making its protagonist, a self-absorbed Wall Street trader named Simon Green, a morally flawed, buffoonish romantic.The conceit of the switch is fine, but the execution is simply not as gutsy as the concept. Consequently it is useless to make any further comparisons between the movies as the former was written as a 1960's social statement at the height of the civil rights movement, while the latter feels like race is being used as a generic plot device for a series of soft-hearted comedy bits similar to those in the "Meet the Parents/Fockers" movies. The threadbare plot focuses on Simon, the upwardly mobile boyfriend of Theresa, a free-spirited photographer. Of course, he's white, she's black and they travel to New Jersey to meet her parents, Percy and Marilyn Jones, who are planning a celebration around their 25th anniversary and - color me surprised - don't know Simon is white.What happens thereafter until the inevitable conclusion is relatively inconsequential, as most of the comedy is predictably derivative - the mistaken identity greeting; Percy and Simon having to share a bed (a pale rip-off of the much funnier "Planes, Trains and Automobiles"); the testosterone-driven go-kart competition gone awry; a sexually questionable party organizer that recalls Martin Short's loopier turn in "Father of the Bride"; the male-bonding all-nighter between Simon and Percy; and a hen-party of men-bashing women cackling and giving poor advice to Theresa and Marilyn (shades of "Waiting to Exhale").An hour into the film, there is a surprisingly provocative dinner scene in which Simon tells a succession of "black jokes" at Percy's goading until he inevitably crosses the line to offensiveness. If the rest of the film maintained the edginess of that moment, it could have gained some much-needed resonance. But instead of a thoughtful look at contemporary racism, we have a "fish out of water" story that flows downstream. Yet, the movie somehow manages a genuine sense of goodwill by the end, for example, there is a subtle moment when Theresa explains Simon's work situation in surprising detail to her father and then catches herself caring about him before going further.Bernie Mac plays Percy with his trademark comic bluster - hilariously brilliant on TV but here rather constrained by the conventions of his character and the weak-willed script. The female performances help the proceedings considerably - Zoe Saldana is refreshing as Theresa, exuding a Thandie Newton-like quality of dewiness but with greater verve; Judith Scott makes Marilyn the ideal wife and mother - sexy, no-nonsense and sympathetic; and Kellee Stewart makes her moments count as sassy little sister Keisha (she delivers the movie's best line when she first sees Simon: "Oh my God, are we being audited?"). Unfortunately, like Adam Sandler and Ben Affleck, Ashton Kutcher is part of a generation of actors who suffer from a lack of dramatic gravitas. Although likable at times, he lacks sufficient depth and texture to carry a movie with a social message, even one as watered-down as the one presented here.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is okay. There are parts when it has you rolling on the floor laughing, and other times it's so boring it can put you right to sleep. It's about a white guy (Simon) and a black girl (Theresa)who get engaged and decide to announce this at Theresa's parents' 25th anniversary party. Simon does everything he can (even extreme lying) to impress Theresa's moody father (Percy), but every attempt to do this backfires on him. The thing that is really funny is that the only reason Percy likes Simon at all is because Simon has a great job at the JP Oliver law firm, but Simon quits this job right before he leaves to meet Theresa's family. But he does not mention this to anyone, not even Theresa, and when this secret is exposed, Theresa becomes furious and calls off the engagement. Can Simon win her back? I won't reveal that one!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was an OK movie for its category, that being the films made on a conveyor belt by using a big molded pattern. You take some actors, add some small, insignificant spice to the movie, then you stamp it hard to take the form of movies you know had success. Moderate success, but with a huge English speaking audience, moderate brings you the big buck.Now, for this horrible, boring movie category, this film was OK. Ashton played OK, so did big Mac, all the rest was cliché after cliché. Somehow, movies about boys meeting her parents or the first time, goofing a bit, then succeeding to be part of the family always find an audience. It is always painful and, in most cases, a complete failure, but still, after going through this, we watch movies of other people going through the same routine. Are we masochistic or are we sadists?In this particular film, the boy is white, while the (unsuspecting) family is black. This is the small spice additive. The rest just follows the pattern.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The big joke of "Guess Who" is that the Joneses are whiter than the pasty boy toy their baby brings home! But as if to prove you can take the boy out of the hood but you can't take the hood out of the boy, Bernie Mac does his obnoxious, grammatically-challenged, egomaniacal shtick which is totally wrong for the educated man he's playing. Worse was Percy's creepy obsession with protecting his not-so-innocent baby from McWhitey while ignoring his other daughter, who's a skank-in-training. Yep, family means so much to Percy, he tossed Dad in the old folks home, dragging him out for special occasions. It's obvious Dad exists solely to react to the jokes Percy bullies Simon to crack. The joke wasn't nearly as offensive as the ones before it; for Dad try to throttle Simon over it is just inane! It shows the film makers have no understanding or respect for the characters. This is epitomized by the reason the future Master of the Universe quits his job like the dumb wuss he is. If that happened in the real world, the boss would be sacked and Simon would be one rich brother from the subsequent out-of-court settlement! For all its posturing as an examination of race relations, the film makers have no idea how to address the issue. It's just goofy male-bonding on rom-com autopilot.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This romantic comedy is better than its given credit. Theresa(Zoe Saldana)brings her fiancé Simon Green(Ashton Kutcher)home for her parents' 25th wedding anniversary. There is one small detail that will become a big issue...Simon is white. Percy Jones(Bernie Mac)will use everything at his disposal to break his daughter's engagement in the name of protecting her. Simon has an embarrassing secret he has yet to share with Theresa...he recently quit his job with a stock brokerage. Percy discovers the secret when he runs a credit check. Theresa's mother Marilyn(Judith Scott)tries to force her husband to give Simon a chance. Planning the anniversary party tends to induce stress, but not before a series of comic complications.One of my favorite scenes is at the family dinner table when Percy challenges Simon to share a few "black jokes". I got a kick out the scenes with Percy trying to find music on the car radio that did not pertain to "black and whites".The scenes with Kutcher and Saldana at times seem forced. I would have really been impressed if the role of Zoe had been played by Kellee Stewart, who plays Zoe's more outgoing sister. Scott is excellent as Mrs. Jones dealing with her very vocal, sarcastic husband. Also in the cast: Hal Williams, Robert Curtis-Brown and Paula Newsome. I laughed more than I thought I would.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GUESS WHO? Hired this last night. Wasn't expecting much, but Bernie Mac movies are kinda like Chris Rock movies- you like the guys so much you'll nearly always give them a chance, hoping for at least a couple of good one liners.From early on it's pretty clear it's a poor rip-off of "Meet The Parents", which was probably in a way a rip-off of the original "Guess WHo's Coming To Dinner". It's probably a less ridiculous and more believable scenario in this movie, but you don't get how Simon (Kutcher) puts up with Percy's (Mac) actions. It has it's moments (particularly mid movie when the whole family sits down for a meal), but after about the first hour I found myself saying "they've used every possible joke, how about we wrap this up?".A few good laughs, probably recommended for a lazy weekend afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ashton Kutcher (Punk'd, Butterfly Effect), Bernie Mac (The Bernie Mac show, Bad Santa) and Zoe Saldana star in this comedy that is basically a meet the parents type story. Kutcher's character is successful and well-adjusted so the comic situations mostly arise from the fact that his girlfriend's family were expecting someone black.I think Kutcher and Mac have crossed over to feature films successfully, and they perform their parts well in Guess Who but I think the writing or the direction holds them back. I found too often that as soon as a situation started I could predict how the scene would play out.There wasn't a lot that I laughed at, I'm not sure if this film has been miscategorised but as far as the comedy goes it's pretty thin on the ground. Maybe this could be considered more of a romantic comedy than a straight-up comedy.For any readers trying to decide whether to watch this or not, I'd give it a miss if you're after a Kutcher-Mac laughsfest as it may bore you, but if you're in the mood for a heartwarming relationships story with some comedy mixed in, this might be your cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess Who is a remake from the movie "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner". It stars Bernie Mac, Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana. Ashton Kutcher plays Simon Green. His girlfriend Theresa's (Saldana) parents are having a 25 Year Anniversary and she takes him to go meet her parents. Only she forgets to mention one thing. He's White. Percy (Mac) makes it a big deal and treats Simon like something else other than human. From trying to check him into a hotel to making him sleep in the basement, Percy just doesn't like Simon. Of course we all know what was going to happen in the end. This movie reminded me of Meet The Parents, but only Meet The Parents is quite better.I liked Guess Who. It was funny and entertaining. Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher worked great together. It's weird seeing Kutcher in a role like this. I'm used to seeing him in his other movies and him on the hit series "Punk'd". Zoe Saladana was good in this. Although in some of her movies she was pretty annoying. I recommend Guess Who to fans of Comedy and Romance. I would give it a 7.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No surprises, what you see is what you get</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Honestly I don't know if you pick up Guess Who how you can say you hate it because you have to know right from square one, just from looking at the box, or even just see who's in it to know exactly what it is. Ashton Kutcher is beginning to become stereotyped with these type of gushy comedy romances (Just Married, Boss's Daughter, and to a lesser extent A Lot Like Love. He hasn't done anything remarkable or different since The Butterfly Effect. Point is anyone going into Guess Who has to know exactly what they are gonna get...no surprises. So if you don't want it, don't watch it. It's not outright hilarious, it's more subtle, sitcom type comedy and Kutcher and Bernie Mac as the future father-in-law are left to carry the whole film in a rather unremarkable supporting cast, and an unremarkable tedious script.The movie is not bad, don't get me wrong. You could do far worse for a cute little movie on a Saturday night but that's all it is...cute. It never gets roll on the floor funny and Mac and Kutcher have awesome chemistry together that never gets unleashed. The two of them could have been the ultimate rivals and instead it's all done with just a hint of what could have been. Both guys are great comedians and in my opinion not terrible actors but they aren't used to the best of their abilities. There is of course the racial undertone throughout the film which is dealt with in a quiet non-confrontational, humorous manner which is a nice change.I admit I love Mac, ever since the hidden little gem Mr. 3000 which I thought was just awesome...yes go ahead and kill me...but I just can't get over how poorly done this script was. It felt like it needed some physical comedy, some big laughs...some might compare it to Meet The Parents but at least that film went for over the top outrageous comedic stunts. Although I enjoyed Guess Who's less gross out adult comedy and a bit more family aimed. Overall it's an okay movie that gives you exactly what it says it will. Basically you see the best parts in the numerous commercials for the film which were showed to death during theater and DVD release. Check it out for something light and cute. 6/10</fullReview>

Despite some laughs here and there, the movie isn't worth a cinema ticket.The movie is about a Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) who visits his fiancée's family for the first time. Percy Jones (Bernie Mac), being the father, greatly questions Simon's suitability as his daughter's future husband.Bernie Mac appears in this movie in a role similar to his role in "Bernie Mac Show". He is the man who cares about the family and wants their best interest in all means possible. As for Ashton Kutcher, he is the shy cute guy with his main concern is satisfying his fiancé's father.There aren't any outstanding performances in this movie. The script is poorly written and the movie is directed in a rush. Overall, I give the movie a 4/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting analysis of casual racism in the noughtys, played out in the confines of your average Hollywood movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm in two minds about this movie. My first opinion is that this movie is your standard "beginning-middle-end they hate each other then grow to love each other" Hollywood guff, with added racism and the Hollywood interpretation of what has been classed 'metrosexuals'. Yet the movie is full of great observations and comparisons that it certainly greater than average. At its core it's pointing out how ridiculous it is to judge and treat someone because of something as mundane as the color of their skin. It then goes to the next level by examining casual racism (such as slang names for different races, and racist jokes). The younger sister thanking her fellow sibling for bringing a white guy home because all the bad stuff she does from now one will be nothing in comparison to what her elder sister just did. It's done in jest, yet shows how people see a difference when in fact there should be none. In an intentionally embarrassing scene we see what the reactions are when these jokes that are meant to be private are said to the intended subjects of the joke. Racism in the elderly is deftly handled as well, showing how its not hatred per say, but its just how they've grown to see the world. The only difference between racism then and racism now is that they deem it socially acceptable to comment about it. They can be (and in this movie) are good, but say really hurtful things. This compared to today's society when later, the daughter says "I know times have changed, but you should really hear what people say to us, the way they look at us." Have times really changed that much? The main character (Bernie Mac as the Dad) is shown to be racist. What impressed me was that his character arch was not him being racist, then getting to know the potential sun in law and suddenly beginning to love him. I don't think he's as racist as portrayed in the film. He simply uses overt racism as a defense tool against a new guy who's seeing his daughter. At the end he's still gruff towards Ashton Kutcher's character and still sees the world as he always did; but with the added exception that he sees and accepts that he has a new member of the family in the form of a new son in law. This film has many subtle moments in its overall loud comments on racism that I do believe that there was a different version of 'Spanglish' in there at one point. My favorite point of the whole movie is when we find out why Ashton Kutcher's character quit his job. There's no moralizing or ranting, just the dad suddenly beginning to understand his potential son in law. It was that scene which made me realize that this movie is greater than the sum of its parts. At no times does it descend into slapstick (as other movies would when they run out of jokes) thank the lord. I highly recommend this movie to those who can see past the adverts of this movie that portray it as 'kooky black racism with jokes'. But it's certainly a 'find it OK' or 'hate it' kind of film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Here's some neat facts about the movie, which had some exterior shots of my hometown in Cranford (where's it's based out of). -The police patches and badge style of the officer in the go-cart scene were authentic (except the 8 point hat). The large patch on the police car matched the real Cranford police patch, but the design of the police car did not match Cranford's (black and white's). -The taxi in the beginning of the movie made a left turn onto North Avenue against the lane markings (after passing under the NJ Transit Bridge). Surprised that didn't make it into the "goof's" area. Overall, I really didn't believe that Bernie Mac's character didn't like Ashton's character. He wasn't cold enough. Bernie was trying to be funny, and their on-screen interaction wasn't distant enough. Ashton's just the same spaz character throughout each movie he's in. But, at least they're two big names for this remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ashton Kutcher almost prevented me watching The Butterfly Effect. I eventually got talked into it and it is now a favourite. Fantastic plot and Kutcher is tolerable ? even believable. Bernie Mac is fantastic. Hilarious in stand-up comedy and movies such as Ocean's 11 and Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle. Taking these factors into consideration, I watched Guess Who. Kutcher plays Simon Green and stars opposite Zoe Saldana, as Theresa Jones. They play a young interracial couple in love, going to meet the future in-laws, played by Mac as Percy Jones and Judith Scot as his wife, Marilyn. The plot lacks originality. Mac gives a solid performance however can't carry the movie on his own to account for Kutcher's lack of acting ability. The laughs are few, delivered by Mac. The storyline grows tired a quarter of the way in. The film touches on racial issues, romance and comedy but doesn't quite deliver with any of the above. The ending is predictable. Without Mac, it's doubtful the film would have made it to cinema. Do yourself a favour and wait for the video.</fullReview>

Guess Who is also a remake of the classic Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, and could'nt shake a piece of bread at that masterpiece, but instead of even trying it just try's to crush laughs out of its own audience. The story is fair, it worked great in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner, but that was a drama, and that I think is where it goes wrong. The Screenplay is fair also, the dialogue is good, but the jokes don't usually work, and the scenes are put together wrong. The acting is bad, but than again we already knew that Aston Kutcher and Bernie Mac are a pair of non actors. The direction is even worse, it seems to not know what kind of movie it is making, the direction might have worked on an animated film. The visual effects are also fair but are also in all the wrong places.</fullReview>

Many of the race jokes were just petty and childish, perfect for an Ashton Kutcher film. Mac and Kutcher do however riff off each other pretty well but it's very hard (nay impossible) to see Kutcher as a romantic lead no matter how bumbling he presents it. "Guess Who" is another tepid remake short on real laughs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>With one of the most popular comics in tow, director Kevin Sullivan had the opportunity to make one of the funniest movies of the year. Instead, a casting mistake and poor execution meant a movie that had the potential to be on par with Jay Roach's 'Meet the Parents', fell short.The usually side-splitting Bernie Mac seemed constrained while the young Ashton Kutcher, who manages to be funny at times, appears to be miscast in this odd-couple caper. Still, Bernie does his best to hold up the movie and manages to keep the audience amused.The bright spot in the movie is the vivacious performance of the slender Zoe Saldana which leaves the single male audience yearning for a refreshing woman like Theresa.Although there are several laughs throughout the movie, most of which are in the trailer, one can't help but feel that expectations weren't met. Bernie Mac is one of the funniest comedians today and to hold him back can only hinder a movie.If you're in the mood for an enjoyable evening at home with the family, 'Guess Who' is worth the rental as everyone will have something to smile about.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A comic twist to the 1967 Spencer Tracy, Katharine Hepburn, Sidney Poitier, and Katharine Houghton ground-breaking picture Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. This time around the proverbial shoe is on the other foot as Ashton Kutcher (a.k.a. Simon Green) tries to finagle his way into the hearts of the Percy Jones Family; patriarch by Mr. Bernie Mac.Simon Green is an upwardly mobile individual, full of potential and possessing the two things that Percy Jones demands in potential suitors for his daughter: (1) an excellent credit report, and (2) a job. Of course, after meeting Simon, Percy realizes that he might have a third requirement. However, unbeknownst to everyone involved, Simon has just quit his job. Simon has joined his fiancée, Theresa, on her parent's 25th wedding anniversary; they are planning to use this event to announce their own engagement.Percy Jones resides in an upper income neighborhood, and wants nothing but the best for the little girl. Although, the sight of his future son-in-law does take him back. As in the first film, the mothers are easier to win over. However, Percy is skeptical to say the least. After some very embarrassing circumstances, both Percy and Simon are left without their significant other; this provides the perfect opportunity for them to get to know one another. After a long heart-to-heart conversation, Percy realizes that Simon, though jobless, does love his daughter.The events that follow are corny, but comical. I did enjoy this film. The reversal of switching to a black family dealing with a white fiancée was original enough, and Bernie Mac is Pure Genius. I think you will enjoy this film as well, if you give it a chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is about Simon meeting Theresa's parents for the first time and all the comedy and love that comes with it as he tries to impress the future father in law.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really recommend this movie to anyone. I think that Theresa and Simon have a very realistic relationship that I could truly see one of my friends in a relationship like theirs. Like real love, they have their ups and downs, their awkward moments, and their little fights and all those little things that make it a real and believable love and not just a movie love. It's not your typical fantasy life is not really like a chick flick movie. It is a good mix between comedy and the tough stuff. Simon seems to really love Theresa and you can really tell that they are good for each other and compliment each other. I'm kinda a romantic and like the fantasy chick flicks, but this one is probably one of my favorites because the relationships and situations are what love is really about and how it is to want to make that good first impression on your future in-laws. Bernie Mac plays a great dad and reacts like a real father would when meeting his daughter's boyfriend for the first time. One of my favorite lines of his was when Ashton says, "You knew you were going to kick me out a week ago?" and Bernie replies, "Boy, I knew I was going to kick you out 24 years ago when the doctor announced it was a girl." That just seems like something a real father would say. So overall, I love this movie and recommend it to anyone. Don't let the chick flick part turn you away, it's more realistic than most. To me, this movie is not mainly about the race issue, or any other issue other than love and the love of two people wanting to spend the rest of their lives together and trying to work their two worlds into one.</fullReview>

But the moral of the story is True Love and thats what you see in this movie so everyone stop making such a big deal jeez. I thought Verney mac treated everyone the same he was rude. It was wrong when her grandfather talked about his grandma like that cause i wouldn't let no one talk about my granny i would have to cut them. but anyway i love Ashton hes so funny. and Verney i love him too but since Ashton is more in my age range i like him more he attractive too uh oh i think i have a crush anyway they say i have to write ten line so I'm just killing words. but my point was true love has no shade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>21st Century pseudo-Poitier becomes "Father Of The Bride"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bernie Mac and Judith Scott appeared to be a bit too young to be the parents of girls in their mid-20's, yet the premise is all too real in the USA and in the Caribbean...Many black families have a problem with racial jokes yet object to their children being "colour-blind," and marrying outside The Race, but this is a problem swiftly solved by both intendeds letting everyone in their respective families know that they're marrying each other and not the family! Back to the picture, Bernie was funny as the NASCAR loving loans officer and Ashton Kutcher was good as the well-meaning devoted and sappy fiancé.However, the problems started from the time that Theresa/Zoe Saldana left out that Simon/Kutcher was caucasian...Some of the stereotyping in the picture is probably parodied as it needs to be made like a dinosaur, extinct and fast - having an anniversary celebration that only one side wants and doing what YOU would like and not really have the other person in mind; the Metrosexual male (I was shocked to see Dante, the Wedding Designer was married, must've been for convenience); black women gathering in a drunken hive to bitch over a man who's done one of them wrong and not answering your mobile for pride's sake... Pride don't keep you warm at night, sugar! Grow up and tell your Mommy too! The hilarious parts involved Bernie getting his pants adjusted, Ashton teaching Bernie how to dance, the Go-Kart race and Ashton's accurate prediction of the rain and Bernie's refusing to use the windshield wipers - His character was best summed up at the hotel, when it was learned he rerserved a room from the time he knew his wife gave birth to baby girls! Yet in the end, when Bernie got what he originally wanted, he discovered it was no longer so as he learned how much Simon/Kutcher really loved his daughter and that Simon indeed had principles even if he didn't play sports...Opposites attract, plain and simple - Simon is businessman and Theresa is an artist... They have what the other longs to be! Same as the speech that Bernie stole from Ashton to woo back his wife on the day before their 25th Wedding Anniversary.In the end, for this culture - at any rate, fathers just have to realise they can't marry their daughters (except for Woody Allen) and just grit and bear the fact they will never accept whoever their daughter marries even if the prospective son-in-law develops the cure for AIDS! Better to dislike him and have grandkids with blond dreadlocks and light eyes than not knowing where your daughter is as she eloped and left the country or moved town to avoid seeing or hearing you...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you have seen "Meet the parents" or any film like that then you know it will remind you of this film. Instead of your father to be being an ex-C.I.A agent he is black and does not like him at all and trusts no one who is white. Until at the end despite being a liar, upsetting his dad and telling a racist joke his noble side shine's through (after having a major argument with his girlfriend) just like meet the parents they make up and get married. Jokes are predictable and not funny, laughed twice through the film (think that was the go-kart race). I would not bother watching this film instead take a trip to the zoo and stare at the monkeys it's far more entertaining.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Many of the critics of this movie need to chill out. "Guess Who?" is meant to be a light-hearted look at what happens with interracial dating in the modern world;it is not meant to be taken so seriously. Also, the use of changing the situation around and making the woman African-American gives the audience a different point of view and lets them see it a totally different way. Remakes are not meant to be exactly how the first movie was...because if it was what exactly would the point be? "Guess Who?" is a refreshing look at interracial dating today by showing how some things have changed...and some things have never change. In my opinion this movie was great--I mean, it's no "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" but it isn't supposed to be. Take "Guess Who?" for what it is, and when watching it...try not to think too hard.

		<shortDescription>'Guess Who' fails to remake a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Guess Who's Coming to Dinner," released in 1967, examined racial tolerance with a story about a young woman bringing home an African-American male to her parents and requesting marriage to him. It was a groundbreaking feature that was a little trite, but ultimately important.The new film "Guess Who" takes its name from the original, as well as its central plot point (a woman brings home a man of different race.) However, 38 years after the original, interracial relationships aren't uncommon enough to be a daring subject for the screen. In turn, the producers decided it should be a homogenized racial comedy instead of a social commentary piece.Boring and frequently unfunny, 'Guess Who' is an uninspired trip in familiar territory. Having much more in common with "Meet the Parents" than the original movie, "Guess Who" takes the unfriendly in-laws approach.The story unfolds under simple pretenses. New Yorkers Theresa (Zoë Salda?a) and Simon (Ashton Kutcher) have recently decided to get married. They're young, happy and of two different colors. Although they receive foul comments from people about their relationship, they've decided to stick it out. Only one thing is left before they can get married: Simon has to meet Theresa's parents, Percy (Bernie Mac) and Marilyn (Judith Scott).Theresa decides to bring Simon along to her parents' 25th anniversary party, where they will be renewing their vows. A big problem arises from the fact that Theresa didn't tell her family Simon was white. Her sister and grandfather have their own comments to say about it, but Percy seems the most taken aback.To make matters worse, Simon has just quit his job as a stockbroker, but in an effort to impress Percy and Marilyn, he pretends as if nothing has happened. This little fib eventually leads to more complications.You can see where this going. "Guess Who" is startlingly predictable, leaving nothing for the viewer to guess.The screenplay, credited to David Ronn, Jay Scherick and Peter Tolan, is just too tame to evoke many laughs. It tries to incorporate the comic subtleties of "Meet the Parents," but each joke tries too hard, creating a reverse effect.Thankfully, Mac, one of the best black comedic actors around, ensures that the movie is not a complete failure. His charismatic presence on the screen adds a few laughs, even when the dialogue is lacking. Although, when he is not on the screen, the film suffers.In addition, there are a few great moments when Simon and Percy begin to acclimate to each other. The two drink vodka, play indoor football and practice the tango together, creating an unusual bond.It appears director Kevin Rodney Sullivan ("Barbershop 2") was trying for a "love triumphs over color" film with comedic moments to smooth out the edges. However, it doesn't work as well as it should.It's not as if the film doesn't try to do something with its subjects of race and in-law acceptance, it just doesn't do enough of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>GUESS WHO, in my opinion, is a good comedy that will make you laugh, smile, and feel good from start to finish. If you ask me, it was absolutely romantic that Simon (Ashton Kutcher) and Theresa (Zoë Salda?a) were engaged. Also, to me, Percy (Bernie Mac) was an absolute a******! The reason I said that is because she couldn't handle Kevin being engaged to Charlie. However, when Charlie slapped her, I was amazed. Now, in conclusion, I highly recommend this good romantic comedy that will make you laugh and feel good to anyone who's seen GUESS WHO'S COMING TO DINNER, although I haven't seen that one. You're in for lots of laughter, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it.</fullReview>

The trailers on TV were excellent and Bernie Mac is an great comedic actor but about half way thru I was getting so agitated and could not sit still. I rarely walk out of movies but I was close to this one. I think it was ASton Kutcher that made it as bad as it was. Yes, Bernie Mac was relentless in his bullying but Ashton rarely stood up for himself and when he did, he just spoke out of the side of his mouth ....mumbling. It was just painful to watch.The last 20 minutes of the movie were the best...but it just did not redeem the movie.I wondered why the theater was empty on a Saturday nite...the movies reviews must have killed it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Boring and not funny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I found so many things wrong with this movie, it's hard to know where to start. For one thing, it's not funny. I think I laughed out loud about three times. Even worse, there are many times when you are expecting--make that hoping--that something funny is going to happen, or someone will say something funny--but it doesn't happen. For example, there's the go-carts, a scene that wants to be played for big laughs. What is funny about two men driving go-carts? Nothing. Something MIGHT happen along the way that's funny, but doesn't. They race, they make crazy turns, and they yell loudly. And it seems that when they discovered this wasn't funny, they had to add some slapstick to end the scene. Trouble is, it's so unbelievable that it's painful... and unfunny. Related to that are scenes and dialog that go on and on without making any contribution to the story or to the exposition of the plot. Like when the sister takes a drink out of the refrigerator, shakes it up and drinks it while her mother makes a face. And then someone starts talking. What is the point of that action? Why did the camera linger on it? Why do we care?The worst example of this is about 2/3 of the way through, when the two lovers run off into the night and end up telling each other how much they love each other. This is perhaps the longest scene in the movie, but it serves no purpose. What is it doing there? To show us how much they love each other? We already knew that. Character development? Hey, the movie is 90 minutes old--it's a little late for that.And the editing is so awful at times, it makes one cringe--such as when Kutcher is climbing back into the basement. One moment he's fiddling with the window, and a second later he's standing on the floor next to the bed. And at the end of the go-cart scene, the two guys are surrounded by cars and trucks and the sound of a crash; and in the next moment, all the traffic is flowing smoothly around them. But I think the most disappointing thing is how little the movie makes of its premise. About 75% of the conflict in the movie has nothing to do racial issues; instead, it has to do with a guy trying to get along with his girlfriend's dad. In this way, it is very close to Meet the Parents. But Meet the Parents was funny because it had a lot of funny jokes and situations, and it honored its premise. Guess Who has very few funny jokes, but worst of all, it doesn't do much with its premise. And the "black joke" that is supposed to be a shocking, critical point in the drama isn't even all that offensive.About half the audience at my screening walked out before the movie was over. Too bad. I wanted this to be a good movie, but I guess the writers and director didn't want it as much as I did.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like a cartoon episode</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although this film was intended to be a modern-day and comedic version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, IMHO, Guess Who played much more like an episode of "The Proud Family" cartoon. Bernie Mac's character, Percy Jones, seemed especially like the over-protective, nobody's-going-to-date-my-daughter cartoon father that Penny Proud contends with every Saturday morning on ABC.Unfortunately, Guess Who barely touched on the racial issues. The jokes about racial difference were old and predictable. The funniest portrayal of the racial difference was the music playing while the father and the fiancée were riding together in a car. And in true sit-com fashion, all the issues are ironed out for a nice happy comedy ending.If you don't mind paying a few dollars for a matinée show, it's not a bad way to spend a couple hours entertaining the children. Otherwise, I'd say skip it.</fullReview>

An easy way to try to create a nice (which nice is totally not in this case) humor about the natural racial preventions which every race still fill in front of other races (unfortunately). This movie sometimes makes you laugh, most of the time is stupid and pathetic. Technically this movie is very cheap (many directors of comedy genre does not take care of a good cinematography etc).

		<fullReview>Another feeble attempt from an idea-bankrupt Hollywood to cash in on past classics (Guess Who's Coming to Dinner) and recent successes (Meet the Parents). It puts nothing new on the table. All the jokes are predictable and stale, and the subject itself is somewhat offensive since it seems to (yet again, as in "Taxi" or "Hitch") justify racially-tinged humor at white guys without taking the same swipes at the other races dishing it out. In other words, it's just Hollywood making another safe bet. But irrespective of that, it's just not a funny movie. Bernie Mac is not a chuckle-inducing actor. His entire repertoire consists of making funny faces and acting aghast when confronted with a sitcom-like situation, which in the real world most of us would brush off as a problem barely worthy of consideration. And Ashton Kutcher is a total dud. He's also a one-note actor, like Bernie Mac in a way because his acting range also consists solely of gulps and looks of surprise in response to stupid, artificial situations. Bad movie. Only for dummies with no discriminating palettes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the updated reversed version of "Guess who's coming to dinner" Ashton Kutcher is the white man that his black girl brings home to her parents. Her father Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) is off put that she brought home this honky ass cracker, and precedes to goad Aston into telling off color jokes, go cart racing, and other things. This film was rather unfunny, didn't have anything profound to say like the previous version, in matter of fact, it doesn't do much of anything well at all. A better updated version of "Guess Who" would be to keep Ashton as the boyfriend, but replace the parents with Demi Moore &amp; Bruce Willis (get rid of the girlfriend part). THAT I'd pay to see ( this I just caught on Encore). Yea i know, my hypothetical film as great as it would be would NEVER be made.. However with the success of "Brokedown Mountain" (critical NOT financial), I think I know what the next version of "Guess Who" is going to be and may god help us all. But I digress, back to this movie. This film is best summed up in two words: SUPREMELY forgettable.My Grade: D</fullReview>

And being an avid lover of "Guess who is coming to dinner," I had even more to worry about. However, I believe that this "new take" on the movie was great and inventive. It was updated to give it a modern twist and wasn't an exact replica of the original. In fact I laughed hysterically through out the movie. Of course there may be some over-the-top antics, but it is in good fun and this definitely constitutes a meaningful feel-good movie. So I am recommend watching Guess Who highly.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am stunned to see the low rating that this movie is getting here. I saw "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner?", and I found it rather stereotyped and one-dimensional. (And "Adam's Rib" is my favourite movie of all time, so it's not like I don't appreciate Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy.) "Guess Who," on the other hand, is fresh, touching, funny, and honest. The idea of switching the races from the earlier movie -- a white guy being introduced to a black family -- is a good one, and the movie tackles racial issues much more head-on and with an immediacy that affected me. The scene in which the white boyfriend tells jokes that has the family roaring with laughter but then suddenly frigid when one joke goes too far is highly symptomatic of the confusing problems behind the race issue: namely, that there are identifiable differences culturally between (most) blacks and (most) whites, but that some differences are more sensitive (on both sides), and that, in the end, we all wish they would go away."Guess Who" always deals with serious relationship issues in a way that had my wife in tears. Yet, in spite of its seriousness, it was still basically a comedy that made me laugh out loud repeatedly. Unless racial issues are too serious for you to laugh at or too sensitive for you to want to think about, or if you don't like Bernie Mac's style of humor, this is a terrific movie that hits on all cylinders.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I suppose I shouldn't admit this, but after seeing the trailers for "Guess Who" some months ago, I figured it would just be very light entertainment with a lot of slapstick humor. I was mistaken. The director has done a good job of presenting a situation which involves "race relations", but gradually turns it into sharp focus on "what is love?" Bernie Mac is Percy Jones, New Jersey bank loan officer and loving but hard-nosed dad. He has an artist daughter Theresa (very pretty Zoe Saldana) who is bringing her boyfriend home to meet her parents during their 25th anniversary re-dedication party. What she neglects to tell them ahead of time ("I didn't think it would make any difference!") is that he is Simon Green, a very white Wall Street investor. The funny scene that is in the trailers, where the cab shows up and Percy automatically assumes the black guy is the boyfriend and the white guy is the cab driver. So, much of the movie is about Simon trying to please Percy, because he is mad about Theresa and, they are hesitant to announce, are planning to get married. But Percy doesn't trust this white guy.SPOILERS. Simon also has a big secret, and he deceives Theresa, because he quit his nice job right before they left for NJ. We don't find out why until near the end of the movie, but it was because Simon's boss had made a big deal of his girlfriend being black, and Simon quit in defense of Theresa's honor. When Percy eventually figures that out, he accepts Simon and everyone ends up happy. In between, Percy sleeps with Simon on the basement fold-out, to "protect" his daughter. There is a funny, but tense, scene over dinner where Percy dares Simon to repeat the ethnic jokes he has heard, and everyone laughs until ... "What are three things that a black man can't get?"</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Alright, first of all: If something is funny, it doesn't necessarily have to be good. I'm just saying this because now I'm going to declare: "Guess Who" is very funny, but it isn't very good, get it? It is good and that's just perfect for a comedy these days, when all the ideas are running out.It is not like the film has a new original idea, it is a remake of an old film with Sidney Poitier I haven't seen, but I can be sure the screenplay is not the same; not with Bernie Mac on screen. Mac is one of the funniest actors across the world and watching him talk is tempting, because a big laugh can come anytime. There are some films I watch, where I laugh a lot of times, but laughs are little; with Bernie Mac on screen laughs are big, no matter how many.We all know Bernie Mac has always been a good actor and an excellent comedian, but it has been since "Oceans' Eleven" that we've all seen him grow into the leads he's played in his last films. Last week I was watching "The Players Club" and it made me remember the flexible actor he is and the different roles he can play. The role of Percy Jones is made for him, and he takes advantage of it, so to insult white boy Simon Green (Ashton Kutcher) in some occasions, give advice to him in others and ultimately steal the show.The thing with Ashton Kutcher is that I still don't get him. I mean, I wanna like him and his efforts of making each of his characters different couldn't be clearer, but if it hadn't been for his dramatic turn in the amazing "The Butterfly Effect", I wouldn't have noticed a difference in his ways yet. I remember hating him in "Dude, where's my car?" because I hated the film, and just when I was seeing something different in "Texas Ranger", he came back with the awful "Just Married"; maybe the problem is in his role choosing."Guess Who" is the second important film for director Kevin Rodney Sullivan, after the sequel of "Barbershop", and although I didn't see the latter one, his eye for genres is remarkable, with the camera angles in each of the characters' faces at the right comedic moments and the approach from behind in the emotional ones. About the screenplay I won't say a thing, because recently I saw "Monster-in-Law" and the movie follows the same line, so I am amazed I could even say some other things at this point.Despite being another strong point for Mac's recent rising, it wastes chances for the rest of the players, because Zoe Zaldana may look cute, but it is incredible her most noticeable performance to date was in Britney Spears' acting vehicle, "Crossroads" (talking about that film, I haven't seen much of Taryn Manning in a while) where she clearly established how talented she was (I believe she still is).I haven't been disappointed with comedies in my last theater visits, and "Guess Who" lies in my list of "good contemporary comedies"; I hope my luck lasts longer, I'm still waiting to laugh as I laughed with "Liar Liar" again.</fullReview>

Simon is about the Meet the Parents of his girlfriend, Percy Jones (Bernie Mac) and his wife (Judith Scott). When Percy is Shocked at his daughter that she's dating a white guy. Percy is trying to find If Simon is a fake. While Simon trying to know Theresa's father, Percy is pushing Simon as far as he can. Since Percy is trying to enjoy his 25th wedding anniversary.Direcred by Kevin Rodney Sullivan (Barbershop 2:Back in Business, How Stella Got Her Groove Back) made an enjoyable comedy with a well cast role for Bernie Mac playing the Spencer Tracy role. Guess Who is a loose remake of the 1967 interracial romance "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner". The film has the occasional quick hit gag (Like songs "Walk on the Wild Side") with some hilarious moments between Mac and Kutcher. Kutcher and Saldana make a lovely couple in the film.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an fine-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an running commentary track by the director, deleted scenes with optional director's commentary, outtakes and more. The film is wildly uneven but entertaining just the same. The film's highlight:When Simon tells Black Jokes at the dinner table (Which some is funny and some are tasteless) but you wish Percy made some White Jokes also. If you want to see a lighter subject to a Hot Topic, you may enjoy this. (*** ?/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I enjoyed the original well enough (1967, with Sidney Poitier), it was a bit too serious. Yes, inter-racial relationships, especially marriage, might be seen by some as a serious situation, but even in 1967, would a family *really* have handled it like they did in the film? It seemed a forced and ingenuous storyline. On the other hand, this one (Guess Who, 2005) lays it all out on the table and is absolutely hilarious. There's no stepping on eggshells or worry about "political correctness." The characters simply call a spade a spade ... and honky a honky for that matter! The joke scene at the dinner table was side-splitting. It was just more realistic than the original ... and realistic almost always equals "funny." I also thoroughly appreciated the reason for Simon (Kutcher) leaving his job at the first of the film. It builds respect for the character in the eyes of Percy (Mac) as well as the audience. A very good romantic comedy that I think I would even pay to watch again in the theater. A very nice addition to a RomCom hound's personal library.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>No, no, no!. What happen to you people? Again the same story about a man visiting the girlfriend's parents. Again and again. It seem's like the script was stolen from "Meet the Parents" or another "exactly the same" movie. I can't believe that! OK guys: we know that in Hollywood the new ideas doesn't appear, but this is ridiculous. If you not have ideas, donate the money, but this...Poor Ashton Kutcher: when it seemed that her work was ascending, again fall down. I don't know why filmed this movie: one year ago worked on "My Boss's Daughter" (same comedies style).I have 5 stars because I'm a good man.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Guess Who: A Bias Analysis</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 2005 revamping of the 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner portrays a series of social bias in an atypical manner by placing the Afro-American characters not only in greater number and directly opposite to the one Caucasian character, but also by placing them in the upper end of the socioeconomic stratum.As the story goes, Simon, a successful young Caucasian stockbroker, is very much in love with Theresa, his Afro-American live-in artist girlfriend. In light of her parents' 25th Wedding Anniversary Celebration, Theresa brings Simon over to her parents' house for the first time and, in doing so, the young couple is compelled to face society's prejudices which, in turn, force them to introspection and consequently to the discovery that their own prejudices is strong enough to break them apart.Just prior to departing to visit his in-laws-to be, Simon, a promising professional, was faced with the ethical impasse: accept his superior's scrutiny and disapproval on his interracial love relationship or dissent from it by quitting his job and move on as to not only not allow such external biased opinions to interfere with his personal life but also to disassociate from such status quo.In light of such dilemma, Simon, whose name is etymologically presented in the New Testament as Peter, thus inferring valor , quits his job and, as to not mention the reason why, hides his chivalrous act from Theresa and her family, which opens the door for a new assortment of biases to flourish.Percy, Theresa's father, whose name etymologically conjectures the Arthurian-legendary chivalrous knight who was given a glimpse of the Holy Grail , displays his pseudo omnipotence by stating that he can assert his son-in-law-to-be's character "in five seconds". Hence, as the young biracial couple arrives, Percy, insensitive to the possibility of his daughter dating a Caucasian man, assumes that the Afro-American cab driver is his son-in-law-to-be. As the situation promotes social discomfort, it concomitantly denotes that the discriminated against has the capability of being just as discriminatory.As the story develops, Theresa's mother, Marilyn, whose name's Egyptian etymology derives in part from mry "beloved" or mr "love", exercises a great power of rationality and appeasement over the ever emerging racial tensions, which, in turn, increase the marital friction between Percy and herself prior to the renewing of the vows. Eventually, as all sorts of idiosyncrasies get carried out, Simon, hypothesizing that certain sports are "whiter" than others, attempts to impress Percy by falsely alleging that that he has driven NASCAR. Ultimately, as Percy turns out to be a personal friend of Jeff Gordon's, Simon depreciates his status with his father-in-law to be. Meanwhile, as the plans for the ceremony develop, tensions rise. Percy, who had had an issue with Dante, the wedding planner who he erroneously assumes to be a homosexual, further struggles with his wife due to her acceptance and understanding of Dante's metro-sexuality as well as of their daughter's interracial love affair. Furthermore, Marilyn wants a classy second wedding ceremony where they would dance the tango, an atrocity to Percy who wishes to do "The Hustle".As the social discomfort persists, Percy, who had portrayed his son-in-law to be in an ultimate altruist African-American alter ego he named "Jamal", is finally caught on the lie. As Simon confronts Percy about "Jamal", Percy counter-confronts him about NASCAR, hence as to defend the position that each of their lies, caused by a biased societal synergy, had its due justification. Hence, one facet of racial prejudice was argued as legitimate due social process in order to avoid one's discomfort within its own micro sphere. At this point, racial and ethical tension reach the limit causing all involved parties to break apart, which causes gender acceptance to ensue and overcome racial issues in concomitance to a reversal of social roles as Percy sets out in Simon's defense by procuring his best interests before Theresa, and other family members, who was pushed apart by ethnocentricity. Up to this point, the issue of religious virtue is also brought up twice as Percy questions Simon's valor when he asks for liquor at dinner, an issue that is further reasserted when Simon finds vodka at Percy's "Christian house? full of sinners".Reality eventually turns into men versus women, illustrating hence a gender bias whose commonality levels Percy and Simon, both develop a new bond, careless and free. As such, Percy accepts the "whiteness" of Mary's wishes for their second wedding and, veering into an instance of homosexuality he would have previously repudiated, he practices the tango with Simon. As the dance passionate dance is practiced, both men talk to each other from deep within and seemingly at the same level; hence peeling off societal layers of inherited bias.With that done and out of the way, Percy reconciles with Marilyn and attempts to have Simon and Theresa back together. Nonetheless, the young couple seem resent each other's racial remarks and, at first instance, unable to reconcile, remain apart. During his second wedding, however, Percy leaves in search of Simon just prior to reciting his vows. Finding Simon at a train station, Simon tells him that, although noble, it was stupid for him to have let go of his promising professional future because of someone else's meaningless opinion.Returning to his wedding, Percy does "The Hustle" for his vowels, after which he introduces his new son-in-law to his family and friends as "broke, unemployed and white", all of which do not matter because he, i.e. Simon, loves his daughter, i.e. Theresa.All in all, Guess Who causes discomfort and forces one to think about racial, gender and socioeconomic issues as it presents such issues with crude humor and reversed roles that do make situations stand out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Heartwarming comedy about multicultural relationships</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw the preview for this movie and it didn't really make me want to see it. From the preview it seemed to me that it was going to be one of those 'white boy gets introduced into a black family' stories with all the usual stereotypes and situations.Fair enough, there was some of that. But having a mixed-race marriage myself I found that the talking points that came up between Ashton and Zoe's characters were some of the same ones we went through. The usual fear of meeting the in-laws and also the fear of being accepted by a tight-knit (in my case) Italian family.Bernie Mac and Judith Scott were wonderful as Zoe's parents. Strict but funny in their little ways. Being a parent I can see where almost each and every main character was coming from. This movie has become a favourite of my wife and I and we'll definitely be buying the DVD.If only they didn't market it when it first came out as just simply another '(culture 1) boy meets girlfriends (culture 2) family' kind of movie it might have been viewed by more people. The story was much more than that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Guess Who was a good comedy/drama that had to do with father/daughter issues as well as racial issues very well. The characters didn't skirt around the issues, they actually talked about them candidly, which of course got them in trouble sometimes. Of course, BernieMac and Ashton Kutcher were very good in their roles. BernieMac was very good at being the concerned father (and a little insane) about his daughter's relationship and he definitely didn't pretend to be happy when he wasn't. Ashton Kutcher was very convincing at trying to impress his girlfriend's father and get him to like him. There were quite a few very funny moments mostly between BernieMac and Ashton Kutcher. I'm not going to say anything about the end except that I thought it was very original.</fullReview>

Well I was FORCED to watch that stupid movie in one of my classes for school. And let me tell you that that stupid movie put almost everyone to sleep. It didn't interest anyone. And someone even put in their comment about 'Guess Who' that the movie sucked because Ashton Kutcher looked into the camera?? Okay.. um that doesn't make a movie bad ...its just means that your paying waay to much attention. I say its a good movie for teenagers because most teenagers haven't seen 'Guess Whos Coming To Dinner' because its old and Ashton Kutcher is HOTT ..so is Reggie!

When mac told "simon"(Kutcher) to tell some of his black jokes they found most of them funny. this movie was funny. to me this movie is a movie the whole family should watch. It shows you how some relationships can be. when Berine uses Kutcher's line it was funny and it was funny to watch their faces.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I know many of you who watched the original "Guess who's coming to dinner" were proablly disappointed, but it wasn't written for Baby Boomers it's written for younger audiences.I thought this movie was hilarious. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac are a perfect comedy team. Like Gene Wilder and Richard Pryor and can see more movies coming soon starring the two of them.This movie is a great story surrounding keeping secrets from your parents. Especially a secret as big as you're engaged to a "white guy" and you're black.I heard many reviewers saying that didn't think that people still had problems with interacial marriages. I don't know what planet they live on, but that is still such a big social taboo. I was glad this movie tackled this topic in a light yet provocative way.I rarely gives movies 10's but this one deserves it. Go enjoy this great film! I wish they would add comedy to the academy awards because Mac and Kutcher would both win one.</fullReview>

I really liked his portrayal of Simon! Bernie Mac was of course hilarious, playing the protective father very well! Theresa's sister was also a good supporting character, not the typical spoiled sibling! Finally though what i loved most about this film was the on-screen chemistry between the leads Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana! I was very convinced of their love, and that unlike so many other films that deal with inter-racial relationships, the colour of one another's skin was not an issue with each other! I found that this film performed extremely well where other films dealing with the same issues have not! I highly recommend it!</fullReview>

How can you replace Katherine Hepburn, Spencer Tracy, Sidney Pontier these are great actors that are irreplaceable what is wrong with Hollywood can't they make anything new anymore why do they try to remake great classics you just can't remake these films today as the acting today is not that good and the overall production is not of the standard of the Golden Age of Films. I do not know how these remakes get finance to make them because they are not as good or better than the old classic's. Please Hollywood stop trying to remake the past.</fullReview>

I guessed the ending and later I found I was correct, all the 'laughs' I had seen and heard before and I sat there completely board as though I was staring at a blank screen. However, I've seen plenty of films like that before so why was I so surprised at this one? For the simple fact that had this film been reversed and it was a black man coming into a white family, no one could have gotten away with it. I am a strong believer that racial abuse of any kind is unforgivable, but why doesn't the door swing both ways? Why is it perfectly acceptable in a film for a black family not to want a white person in it but not the other way around. As a young white girl, I find this outrageous and am very surprised that it would seem either many people don't see my view or do and are too chicken to raise the point</fullReview>

No matter who you are, you've got to have a good sense of humor to not just punch out everyone on screen, all the way from the almost rhythm-less white boy to the almost ghetto black man. Ironically, I don't think they took enough advantage of the comedy's premise. Bernie wasn't allowed the freedom he normally is in his movies; he is normally a lot funnier than he was. And Ashton, I've seen the role before, just not put into this context. The guy hardly ever amazes me (Butterfly Effect).

		<shortDescription>A Nutshell Review: Guess Who</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The premise of this remake is something you probably have seen before in other mis-matched racial pairing flicks, like the Lethal Weapon series, or Rush Hour series. You'd sort of expect the usual barrage of racial jokes coming hard and fast, but somehow this film falls flat in that aspect.Not that it isn't funny, just that at times, it sounds too contrived and tries just too hard at getting the audience to buy into the idea.While the jokes are somehow weak, it does make up some ground in the relationship aspect - it tries to explore inter-racial relationships, racial bigotry, and near the end gives some tips to the guys in how to maintain a 25 year relationship... but that's that. Since it isn't a serious relationship drama like Sideways or Closer (hey, it's supposed to be a comedy, remember?) the film tends to gloss over details and punctuate these moments with humour.Not that this film doesn't have its moments - the dining table scene and the end credits (yes, do stay and watch, and pay close attention to the dialogue too) were redeeming bits, if I can consider so.We can't blame pretty boy Ashton Kutcher playing yet another pretty boy role similar to My Boss's Daughter, or Just Married. Guess he's a bit stereotyped given the minor success of his better films like The Butterfly Effect, which I thoroughly enjoyed.Watch this show and it feels like you've just been punk'd!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of the controversial classic Guess Who's Coming To Dinner starring Sidney Poitier and Spencer Tracy this version flips the pragmatic white family hosting their daughter's black fiancé with a cynical black family head (Bernie Mac) meeting his daughter's white fiancé (Ashton Kutcher) for the first time. The original was full of social commentary, this remake is just comedy.The film pairs the completely self-contained comedy of Bernie Mac with the ever-popular physical comedy of Ashton Kutcher. Although I'm not a huge fan of remakes, I fell in love with this movie's gentle yet comedic approach to a touchy subject.Bernie Mac just has a way with words. He knows how to say a line and make it hilarious. You or I could say the same thing and no one would laugh. That's a gift few possess. And at the other end of the comedy spectrum, Ashton Kutcher's (aka Demi's Roni) perfect All-American image works well with his squeaky voice and his comedic timing. Bernie Mac was Bernie Mac, but Ashton Kutcher was not Kelso. And that was good.An alternate title for this film could easily have been Meet the Blacks. The storyline was closer to Meet the Parents than Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Both stories involve a girl taking her unsuspecting boyfriend home to meet her over protective parents. The boyfriend, who is normally a great guy, gets caught in a web of lies and plays a complete idiot for the entire weekend.Ashton and Bernie were very funny and they saved the movie...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Can't wait for the sequel - Guess Who 2: Guess Who's Black</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Guess Who is the type of movie I enjoy watching for an hour and a half, but it's not exactly the kind I like to spend over 3 hours writing a review for. So I won't. Why should I? If I heap praise on all the jokes that I felt worked is Zoë Salda?a gonna come running to me, plant a big kiss on my cheek, and shout that I should've been in the movie instead of Kutcher? Doubtful.I know this is a "remake" of 1967's Guess Who's Coming to Dinner, starring Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poitier, but since I haven't seen that movie I can't make any comparisons. However, I can confirm that this does indeed have shades of Meet the Parents.Zoë Salda?a and Ashton Kutcher are engaged, and well, she's taking him to ... DUHN DUHN DUHN ... meet her parents. Sound familiar? Oh, there's a little twist. Salda?a's parents don't know that her boyfriend is white. In fact, IL' Bernie Mac is expecting Denzel Washington to show up on his doorstep, not the skinny, pigment-challenged Kutcher. Mac likes to pretend that race doesn't matter, but we know in movies like this it always does. Well, until the end of the movie where all the characters go through miraculous 90-minute character transformations and everybody learns to accept everybody else for who he or she is.What proceeds is a consistent stream of fun, silly jokes that constantly entertain but never really have the audience rolling in the aisles. You know the formula. Father sleeps with daughter's boyfriend to keep him out *her* bed? Check. Father takes ride with daughter's boyfriend and songs such as Ebony and Ivory conveniently play on the radio? Check. After boyfriend lies about working for Jeff Gordon's NASCAR pit crew it turns out that girlfriend's father loves NASCAR and Jeff Gordon? Check. It's all very coincidental and convenient, heck, it could've easily been titled Guess What Plot Contrivance is Coming Next, but it's funny enough for me not to get all bent out of shape over it.My biggest disappointment is that the movie decided to stay on the "cutesy" and safe side of the interracial fence in an effort to not offend anybody. Come on, a little controversy never hurt anybody, right? Things get a little edgy at dinner one night when Bernie Mac forces Ashton to tell some of the black jokes he knows. Ashton agrees to do it as a way of not "empowering" such jokes. For example, how do we know Adam and Eve weren't black? Well, have you ever tried to take a rib from a black man? Mac and family actually find the jokes pretty funny until Ashton takes it one step too far, causing Salda?a's 80+ year-old grandfather to attempt to cross the table to take a swing at poor Ashton.The movie would have benefited from a little more such edgy humor examining the interracial relationship and the conflicts between the two backgrounds. Maybe we'll see that in a sequel. I'm predicting right now that in a couple of years we'll see Guess Who 2: Guess Who's Black where Ashton takes his girlfriend to meet HIS parents. Throw it into the heart of Mississippi, cast Billy Bob Thornton and Delta Burke as his parents, and you've got some serious potential.THE GIST Guess Who is a fun, silly, easy-going cinematic experience. Bernie Mac, Kutcher, and Salda?a all work well together. If you're a fan of any of those three then give the movie a look. Your sides may never been in imminent danger of splitting, but you just might find yourself consistently chuckling throughout.Rating: 3.25 (out of 5)</fullReview>

Though, the moral of accepting a different colored couple - Caucasian and African American - was very cute. =) I think it's great for young children, like myself, to learn at their point of lives.

		<fullReview>While the original scriptwriter of "Guess Who's Coming To Dinner" got credit for this movie too (perhaps for legal reasons), the two films have little in common. The Spencer Tracy (or Robert de Niro in "Meet The Parents") curmudgeon character is given to Bernie Mac. I think Tracy is the best of the lot.This movie seemed a collection of out-takes. But in my opinion, whole scenes should have been cut. I don't blame the editor, I blame the director. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac can apparently act but they need to put themselves in the hands of a better director.Conclusion? I admire any attempt at cross-cultural understanding but a better truth can be found in Spencer Tracy's "Father of the Bride". This movie is primarily Ashton Kutcher eye-candy. And that's about all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not really a comedic plot?....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what I'm saying, but I just got back from my theatres, employee preview, and Guess Who? wasn't exactly what the trailers made it seem. A lot of the jokes were in the trailer, some of the jokes were really inappropriate. I mean, since there isn't an age limit restriction on PG-13 movies, any 5-year-old can learn about sex, and other sexual stuff. This movie seems to be trying hard to be a funny movie, but also have plot. And it seemed to lack in both. If the plot gets interesting, the movie isn't funny. If it's too funny....there's no plot.Although this was the perfect movie, for Ashton to play, I mean it was pretty awesome.I think the ending should have gone on a bit in the funny category, I mean, we all like the end of the movie sing-a-longs, but they get kind of old after Shrek. Although the movie wasn't the best, I'd probably go sit down, and get a few more laughs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Guess Who" like "Meet the Parents"?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At first I thought this movie would be some kind of cheesy spin off on Meet the Parents except with an interracial relationship. It turned out to be quite original and absolutely hilarious. Although the plot was similar to Meet the Parents (the boyfriend has to win the reluctant father's blessing), the conflicts still ended up being creative and original. On top of being original, I thought that this was the funniest romantic comedy I have seen for quite some time. This is because of the fact that the boyfriend happens to be white which provides plenty of room for some racial jokes. Another element that makes this film funny is the characterization of the two male characters. Bernie Mac plays the character Percy, the intimidating father who's defensive of his daughter, and Ashton Kutcher plays Simon, the clumsy, awkward, white boyfriend who's just trying to impress the father. When these two characters are put together, they create the funniest quarrels and moments. I think everyone who's looking for some laughs and who like the Meet the Parents plot should see this movie. 8 out of 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Relax!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many of the critics of this movie need to chill out. "Guess Who?" is meant to be a light-hearted look at what happens with interracial dating in the modern world;it is not meant to be taken so seriously. Also, the use of changing the situation around and making the woman African-American gives the audience a different point of view and lets them see it a totally different way. Remakes are not meant to be exactly how the first movie was...because if it was what exactly would the point be? "Guess Who?" is a refreshing look at interracial dating today by showing how some things have changed...and some things have never change. In my opinion this movie was great--I mean, it's no "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner?" but it isn't supposed to be. Take "Guess Who?" for what it is, and when watching it...try not to think too hard.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a good comedy that is not overwhelmed by its main subject .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher are teamed perfectly for this film because they are fun to watch together.The story keeps moving along at a good pace and doesn't do the usual joke setups that we have to suffer through so much in comedies lately.The dialog is well written for all of the characters-not just the leads.Whoever cast this movie did a good job because everyone was of good quality and fit perfectly. I was happy to see that interracial relationships were dealt with candidly but not with the usual tasteless one liners.It's so hard to find a good comedy lately , I mean one you actually laugh at. I liked this movie , it's a good comedy, I laughed a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More than just black and white</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have not seen Guess Who's Coming to Dinner and so I am in no position to declare Guess Who as an adequate remake. I do not know that source material it was based on and so when judging its script I will, by default, give credit to the film that I actually did see.That said, I enjoyed Guess Who much more than I thought I would. I was expecting a film built on weak chemistry and a money whoring cast. Now, the ladder may be true but it didn't affect that on screen presence that sells a film. Ashton Kutcher and Zoe Saldana have the perfect mix of trust and understanding with sexual sparks and heated eye contact. If you saw them walking down the street you'd probably say 'Aww, how cute'. As well as their chemistry with each other, they both share some with Bernie Mac, Saldana's father and Kutcher's soon-to-be father-in-law. It's connections like these that make one comedy float and another sink.In the original, Katharine Houghton, the white daughter of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy, brings home a black man, Sidney Poitier. The tables have turned now as Theresa (Saldana) brings home her white fiancée, Simon (Kutcher) to meet her parents Percy (Bernie Mac) and Marilyn (Judith Scott). Every father worries about who his daughter will bring home but Percy has an especially tight grip on his daughter and is not prepared to give her up to just any man. He is even colder to Simon when he learns that Simon no longer has a job and plays no sports, although he did lie about test-driving for Nascar. And when he walks in on Simon and Theresa wrestling to get a piece of lingerie off Simon, Percy decides that's the final straw and that Simon is out of the house.Of course, it's not the last straw because then there would be no movie. What follows is a mix of clichéd moments stolen from daytime soaps and a new bread of racial humor. We don't live in a perfect world and because of that, interracial couples turn heads. This film is a head that turns a full 360 to see the relationship from all sides with derogatory and benign humor toward white and blacks as a side note. Sometimes the film has you holding your side and there's still more coming.Guess Who might appear crude from the outside but it's a charmer once you get past the rocky beginning. There are moments that could have been done without and some social commentary that it is perhaps not in the position to make but then again, what is Hollywood without controversy? And this is not really controversial; it's just a good laugh at the movie theater without a whole lot of B.S. like most other comic offerings now a days. ***1/2 out of *****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Movie For All People</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not just about Black and White. It's about family. Ashton Kutcher's character sums it up pretty early in the movie, "No man looks forward to meeting his future father-in-law." Every father worries about what kind of man their daughter is going to bring home. This is a simple fact. Hollywood has also tried for many years to forget that racial stereotypes and racial discord still exist in places outside of the deep south in our society, and it's refreshing to see them acknowledge it. The movie in particular is really funny. Ashton Kutcher and Bernie Mac make a great comedy team and Kutcher and Zoe Saldana have wonderful chemistry together. Ashton Kutcher also does a pretty good Bernie Mac imitation throughout the film, though someone should probably tell Kutcher he needs to stop singing in movies, he's not very good at it. Just go to the theater with your friends or relations with all thoughts of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner out of your head and you will enjoy this movie immensely.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ebony &amp; Ivory Redux</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When you go see a remake of any kind, you have got to accept the fact that it will most likely be inferior to it's original. I've only seen two remakes to recent memory that were better than the original -- The Manchurian Candidate and Ocean's Eleven (not Ocean's Twelve, oh god, no!). Guess Who is no exception to the rule. It's often hysterical at points but it never begins to be superior than the 1967 original film starring Spencer Tracy and Sidney Poiter. This time around instead of Poiter and Tracy, it's Bernie Mac and Ashton Kutcher (aka that trailer trash Demi Moore's boy toy), and instead of a white girl taking home a black man home to her white conservative parents, it's a black girl taking home a white boy (Kutcher) home to meet her black parents in the 2005 version. The film has highlights and low points. The highlights are the scenes of side-splitting hilarity and the surprisingly special chemistry shared by Kutcher and Mac. The low points is the clichéd story, lower then average acting and scenes in which they mean to be funny but fail almost to the point of embarrassment. There are also scenes in 'Guess Who' that will make you really uncomfortable, like when Ashton Kutcher is having dinner with his fiancé's parents and starts telling black jokes which eventually lead to the old black grandfather of the family almost lunging over the table threatening to kill poor Ashton Kutcher. All in all 'Guess Who' isn't really worth the price of admission to see it in the theaters. My recommendation is to wait for DVD for this one, but in the meantime go out and rent the original 1967 'Guess Who's Coming to Dinner' and see it before this disappointing remake. Grade: C+ (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 3/25/05)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simple light comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This wasn't a movie that immediately grabbed my attention, but I was interested in seeing it. It would be best described as Meet The Parents Lite. Ashton Kutcher does a good job by playing the handsome guy who isn't afraid to be goofy, which pretty much seems to also describe him in reality. He has come a long way as an actor and I have enjoyed the movies I've seen him in, with the exception of "Dude, Where's My Car?". Bernie Mac is enjoyable and an underrated comedy actor. He played the role of the overprotective father perfectly and VERY believably.Don't expect this film to become a staple of comedy or to win any awards, but it is worth seeing and will provide you with some good laughs. Some scenes are memorable enough and the race issue isn't exploited. I actually found the reactions among the characters to be very believable. The jokes aren't pure slapstick, which helped very much. This movie never takes itself seriously and this is probably the reason the chemistry between Kutcher and Mac works so well.Decent film. Take the kids. There are a few moderately adult jokes, but nothing too blatantly sexual or controversial unless you're easily offended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Funny Family Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the laughs from the start to the end. This is a really great film, and deserves 8 out of 10 stars. It will have you laughing out loud in to time. Great movie to watch!It contains really funny jokes, that sometimes is somewhat of racial. This movie has only a few "cus" words, and is a great film for the whole family. It somewhat leaves tears to your eyes, and helps to create a good state of mind. Kids will enjoy this film due to its wacky jokes. The jokes will make them go into their feet. You will love this film, due to its humor. It should be nominated for one of the best films of 2005. So go now, and see this film. You will love it! 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie tonight in a sneak preview and I was not disappointed. I was apprehensive in seeing it, but I made a great choice. All I can say is see this movie when it comes out. There is not one minute where you will not be rolling in laughter and Kutcher and Mac are excellent in their roles. Better than the original, Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Kutcher plays Theresa's boyfriend, who happens to be white. Bernie Mac plays the father who is apprehensive about his daughter dating a white man. Hilarity ensues for the next 2 hours. Much like Meet the Parents but personally I feel a better made movie, without the super star power of De Niro, etc. The 25th of March this comes out. Rush to your local theater. This movie deserves to be Number 1 next week.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>over the years America has made small efforts to end racism. but it seems like each generation, it doesn't go away people just hide it better. but all of the prejudice is always geared towards black Americans. so , i think the actual purpose of the movie, was to switch it around to show that discrimination occurs on both stripes on a zebra. meaning that though some white people don't like black people, some black people don't like white people either- which believe me, is true. in my opinion, the movie was geared to showing the world, that with people becoming more lenient to other races, and compromising, that if the world would stop hating people for what they are and loving them for who they are, than maybe America would have a better economy, and get along better socially.</fullReview>
