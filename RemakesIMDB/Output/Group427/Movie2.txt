		<shortDescription>OK but what was the point?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Dudley Nichols wrote a great screenplay for a great film - 1939's Stagecoach, that is, directed by John Ford, not the 1960s remake we have here.As the Ringo Kid, Alex Cord lacks the menace, dynamism, and screen presence of the young John Wayne - meaning that the focus of this Stagecoach has to be on other participants. Ann-Margret is very good as Dallas (the part originally played by Claire Trevor); while Stefanie Powers makes her mark as Mrs Mallory. Bing Crosby is the boozy doc with a heart (not a patch on Thomas Mitchell's turn thirty years earlier but Crosby was always worth watching); while Red Buttons is disappointing as the liquor salesman with eight kids (far better was the twittery Donald Meek).Using the 1939 screenplay, this film is pretty much a straight remake, but in standard class. Slim Pickens does a fair imitation of Andy Devine as the hapless coach driver, and Bob Cummings is just plain irritating as the crook who has a mysterious case he won't let out of his sight.So, 'Stagecoach' is OK as a time-filler, but was not needed - why bother when the film has already been made and stands as a classic. Liked the end portraits of the cast though, and always good to see Keenan Wynn, however brief a role he has (and it is pretty brief here), although pivotal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Cinemascope / Color Remake.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>20th Century Fox's STAGECOACH (1966) is of course a remake of the classic 1939 John Ford production of the same name. But this later version, and because of its over cherished antecedents, has at times been rather unfairly pilloried by both critics and public alike. I have to admit myself to being never too fond of Ford's much vaunted western. While admittedly there are some great things in it I always found it quite dull in parts and a number of the supporting players not wholly conducive to their respective roles. Also the Ringo Kid's shootout with the Plummers towards the end is little more than alluded to and merely consists of John Wayne hitting the dirt and letting go with a Winchester. It is a cop-out really and is the movie's most disappointing aspect. On the other hand the later remake has none of these failings. All ablaze in awesome Cinemascope and DeLux color it is a sturdier more strident version of Ernest Haycox's story with a well chosen cast. And here Ringo's showdown gets the full treatment in a brilliantly staged and exciting confrontation which has about 15 minutes screen time. The picture is also graced with a terrific score by the great Jerry Goldsmith. Streets ahead of the creaky Acadamy Award winning music by Richard Hageman from the earlier film. Written for the screen by Joseph Landon from Dudley Nichol's original screenplay it was stylishly and excitingly photographed by William Clothier. His opening aerial shot panning across the lovely Colorado locations is breathtaking as it swoops down to track the speeding Stagecoach on its way to Dry Fork. A wonderful spine tingling few moments! Produced by Martin Rackin for Fox STAGECOACH'66 was perfectly directed by the estimable Gordan Douglas.Of course we all know the story which concerns a mixed bag of passengers who are thrown together on an arduous Stagecoach journey to Cheyeanne and fearing, among other things, an Indian attack along the way. There is the banished dance hall girl Dallas (Ann Margret giving the performance of her career), Gatewood the wily and mean spirited embezzler (an excellent Robert Cummings), a surprisingly good Bing Crosby as the whiskey sodden MD, a terrific Van Heflin as Curly the Marshal and shotgun guard, the wonderful Slim Pickins as Buck the stage driver (Pickins - an ex wrangler - was the only actor capable of handling a six team of horses) and Alex Cord making an impressive Ringo. The picture does however get a little bogged down in the middle but there is splendid character development in these scenes and once the Indians begin their pursuit of the stagecoach the action never lets up. Unlike the earlier film and the famous chase across the salt flats - here there is much more vegetation as the Stagecoach is pursued over mountains and through wooded areas and streams before a wheel collapses and the hapless travellers must now make a stand against the Indian horde who they eventually manage to beat off. (This whole chase sequence is quite riveting as the brilliant camera shoots from the air one minute and then from under the speeding coach). The stagecoach finally struggles into Cheyeanne and Ringo must now take on Luke Plummer (Keenan Wynn) and his two murderous sons in a blistering action packed shootout in the best tradition of the revenge western. The picture ends, just like the original, with Ringo and Dallas riding off side by side to begin a new life together.One of the great aspects of STAGECOACH'66 is Jerry Goldsmith's stunning score. The instrumentation is extraordinary! The main title is heard over that amazing aerial shot at the opening and distinctly discerned are jew's-harp, banjo, guitar, a lovely jazzy button accordion, solo trumpet, harmonica and pizzicato strings all lending an authentic and inspired western feel to the picture. Then there is an attractive love theme "I Will Follow" heard in the film's softer moments with Ringo and Dallas which gives their scenes together a tender and persuasive charm. STAGECOACH'66 is one of Jerry Goldsmith's finest scores for a western.STAGECOACH'66 is a good and exciting western and should not be judged as simply a remake of a classic. It should be enjoyed for its own intrinsic value plus the added quality that was brought to an old story with some fresh innovations and new techniques. And, who knows, perhaps in that way this STAGECOACH could itself become a classic too?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ain't a Patch on the John Ford version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this version on AMC a few days ago, I took out my copy of the original from 1939. It's the difference between a classic western and a routine action film.Director Gordon Douglas probably because there is an unwritten rule in Hollywood that no one is ever to shoot a film in Monument Valley but John Ford, shot this thing in Colorado. It's not badly photographed, but you really miss the sweeping vistas of the Arizona desert. The Apache become the Sioux here and instead we have Geronimo jumping the reservation it's Crazy Horse instead. One of the great moments of cinema westerns in the original Stagecoach is when the cavalry sweeps by the passing Stagecoach to engage the Apaches in the rescue. John Ford liked it so much he used the same gambit in Fort Apache. In this version you have to believe that the passengers fought them off themselves and then made it into Cheyenne on three wheels with less horses. No way, Jose.Poor Alex Cord, a competent actor, is no John Wayne. Of course who is and Cord tries his best, but you can't forget the Duke. Michael Connors as Hatfield lacks fire in his portrayal. John Carradine created a real air of mystery about the gambler. Nothing like that here.This is one of Bing Crosby's few non-singing roles and he got some deservedly good reviews for reprising Thomas Mitchell's Doc Boone. In fact some of his scenes with Red Buttons as Peacock the whiskey drummer are faintly reminiscent of Crosby's work with Bob Hope. Buttons is not Donald Meek and he plays the part differently. Meek was a man with a Dickensian name and he played mostly parts that fit that name perfectly. After the Indian attack, Buttons is a man with a few drinks under his belt ready to lick the world. It's different, but nicely done.Another musical performer in this was Ann-Margret. For the life of me I can't figure out why with two people like Crosby and Ann-Margret, they didn't give her and him a song or two, a duet maybe. Especially since in the plot line here, Crosby takes a fatherly interest in Ann-Margret as well as in Alex Cord. Her role of Dallas is as a saloon girl so a musical number would not have been out of place.The rest of the cast performs adequately. Bob Cummings's Gatewood is more fully developed a character here and a bigger rat. Van Heflin and Slim Pickens are able substitutes for George Bancroft and Andy Devine. Stefanie Powers as the pregnant cavalry officer's wife is adequate. The part itself is as thin as the original version with Louise Platt doing it.The gunfight between the Plummers and Ringo is more fully developed here. You actually don't see it in the 1939 version. Keenan Wynn as Luke Plummer is also more fully developed than was Tom Tyler. Tyler with a minimum of dialog suggested the menace of Luke Plummer. But Keenan Wynn is one evil man here.In fact whole pages of dialog are taken from the original. Interesting that 20 years later another version was done. But this Stagecoach is a perfect example of why classics should just be left alone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Ensemble Western Drama/Mild Spoilers, Beware</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns come in several types: classic, John Wayne, John Ford, spaghetti, and ensemble. Each has its strengths and weaknesses. If a viewer is a big Clint Eastwood fan or loves John Wayne, then any film starring those men is golden. However, there is nothing wrong with this film as an ensemble western. It is incorrect to consider it a flat-out remake of its predecessor; the original was both a John Ford and John Wayne project and carried the indelible marks of both men. It was a sweeping vista of a western that focused heavily on Wayne's character, the Ringo Kid. This 1966 version doesn't sprawl across the screen. It has instead a warmer, more intimate feeling that draws the viewer into caring about the characters that inhabit it.The characters are archetypical for a western movie. There's the fallen woman who'd love a chance at redemption (Dallas), the alcoholic doctor (Josiah Boone), tough gambler with a heart of gold (Hatfield), nervous reverend (Peacock), pregnant young lady (Mrs. Mallory), slimy guy with a secret (Henry Gatewood), tough-as-nails marshal (Curly Wilcox) and young misunderstood outlaw (the Ringo Kid). Add a shaky stagecoach driver with no nerve named Buck (how'd he get this job?) and trail perils that include washouts and hostile Indians, some very nasty outlaws called the Plummer Brothers that Ringo wants to kill, and the result could come across as a cliché of a classic western. Somehow, it doesn't. Instead, what was a big-screen extravaganza starring a larger-than-life Duke is melted down into a more balanced and less histrionic movie that is easy to enjoy on a Sunday afternoon.The cast is well-chosen and, despite the temptation to compare them unfavorably to the original set of actors (As though this bunch is second-rate), each plays his part very well. Bing Crosby is perfect as the boozing, amiable doctor who nevertheless comes through in time of need. Young Ann-Margret sizzles on screen as the sultry-yet-sweet Dallas, who loses her heart to the outlaw who treats her like a lady when nobody else does. An also young Stephanie Powers is more than a pretty face in her portrayal of the woman who gives birth. Red Buttons is funny as Peacock and Mike Connors plays the southern gentleman gambler as well as Carradine did; he just appears less creepy. Van Heflin is great as the rugged marshal and Slim Pickens pulls off the shaky driver who keeps bawling that he wants to turn back, etc. Keenan Wynn makes a great and vile killer as the oldest Plummer. And finally, no offense to the Duke or his fans, but Alex Cord was a pleasant surprise as the Ringo Kid. His strange facial features, which are both masculine and sensitive, help him pull off the part of the oddly gentle outlaw who can kill efficiently when he has to. John Wayne's Kid was also good, but on a different level; Cord makes the man he plays incredibly sympathetic, so much so that when we watched the movie for the first time, we kept hoping he wouldn't get killed off. Wayne is great for the older version of Stagecoach and its more epic feel, but Cord fits more seamlessly into this ensemble drama. His on screen presence isn't as big but it's more natural and believable.The movie is slightly shorter than the older one, too, coming across as more economically filmed, yet fleshes out the characters nicely into real people.Some have different levels of good and evil within them: the amiable passenger turns out to be a mean-spirited creep; the disreputable gambler is a true gentleman at heart; the outlaw may or may not have committed the crime that has earned him his unsavory reputation; the saloon girl is surprisingly good with the baby. The characters evoke emotion, whether it be pity, dislike, disgust, or affection. In that sense, this movie succeeds.We liked it better than the older one; it seemed fresher and faster-paced. However, if one's preference is for the more Wayne-centric western, then the 1939 version would be more to taste. However, don't be too quick to put this one down. As a John Ford saga, it didn't work, but as an ensemble drama that focused on all of its characters, the 1966 version came out fine.We hesitated to watch it based on negative reviews and enjoyed it well enough to add it to our video collection.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie in 1966 when it was released, and It was one of the few movies that left an impression on me all these years for several reasons. I feel the aesthetics of this movie make it worth watching. The artwork of Norman Rockwell alone is unforgettable. The music is very appropriate for the movie, not overwhelming but rustic and timed well. The scenes that were shot on location are truly breathtaking. You wont find many mattes or computer digitized images in this movie, Forget about the plot, just enjoy the artwork. But I still feel There are a few good lines in the movie. Some are even worth including in ones vocabulary.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>stagecoach 1966 is a well made film. it only comes up short when compared to the original. Granted Alex Cord is no John Wayne, then again who is. If you look at the other actors and actresses their parts are a little more fleshed out. We learn a little more about the characters throughout the film as compared to 1939. This is another 20th Century Fox Film from my youth that deserves to be at least on VHS if not on DVD, just like the recently released to DVD, What A Way To Go. It amazes me that the film studios will pop out so many dvds that are dreck and ignore classic movies, there are other movies that deserve to be on DVD, such as Major Dundee, Fort Apache, Ride The High Country and others.</fullReview>

I also think that there was more"Meat"to this version.I recommend that everyone see it,buy the video or CD version.It held me captive throughout the entire movie. Everyone's role was more fully expanded and scenes were portrayed better.I've loved Ann Margaret's performances in all the movies she has starred in.I think that she is an top of the line actress.I compare her acting with Elizabeth Taylor and Katherine Hepburn.She is vivacious,beautiful,and would look good even in a gunnysack.Sincerely,rose61348@gwtc.net</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I kind of liked this movie better than the original. First, it was in color; I realize some films are better in black and white, but I'm not a purist and most films benefit with the addition of color. Second, I thought Bing Crosby did a great job as the drunken doctor, better than the original actor. Third, I felt the roles were played with more believability -- for instance Lucy Mallory actually seems to be pregnant. And last, I like the song at the end. Maybe it was only worth a "7" rating, but I gave it an "8" because it was panned so bad by others.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent (color) remake of the 1939 John Wayne version.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the 1966 remake of Stagecoach is not quite of the caliber of the 1939 version, this well done and very entertaining western is well worth a look, if only to see the beautiful color scenery in Cinemascope.Particularly notable among the cast is Bing Crosby, for once in a non singing role. His portrayal of the disgraced doctor with a taste for whiskey is a solid one, it proves that despite some of his later work (Say One for Me - 1959, etc), that the popular crooner could actually act.Alex Cord, (who is remembered for Gray Eagle - in which he portrays a Native American) is here to be seen as Ringo, and pulling a gun on the marauding "Indians" chasing the stagecoach, while trying to keep the sheriff from shooting him as an escapee, and he is in top form. Cord has not the screen presence of his predecessor in the role, John Wayne, but he carries the role off with a believable grittiness that is convincing, nonetheless.Not to demean Robert Cummings, whom I respect very much, and once worked with in films, I don't "believe" his character as the dishonest Banker, he has the right stuff, but doesn't seem able to show it off. His portrayal is nonetheless competent and does not detract from enjoyment of the film.The scenery is outstanding and Gordon Douglas and his cinematographer, William Clothier have done a fine job of giving this film an expansive and authentic look. The music is very good evoking the mood of the film as it changes from tense to exciting and back to tense. The final scenes were a trifle bloodier than the original film, and could have been less drawn out, but overall, the film works well. Just a word about the supporting cast. Ann Margaret is, as always, very fine; Red Buttons (See "Red" in Poseidon Adventure" for comparison) adds a certain comical manner to his role, which was a weak spot in the 1939 version. Mike Connors is convincing and gives the film a "familiar" feel (due to his many television roles, no doubt). Van Heflin is his usual solid self, giving his role all you would expect, but with a hint that given more to do, he would have pulled that off too. All in all, a satisfying if not top notch film, any western buff should find it very enjoyable. If you like Ernest Haycox's book (on which this film is based) "Stage to Lordsburg", you will love seeing his story in color, it really helps.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Agree with a comment about another Edition of Stagecoach.....that with Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings etc. DON'T COMPARE this with the John Wayne movie....Just enjoy it on its own. Alex Cord is cool, Ann Margaret beautiful, Red Buttons and Bing Crosby fun..... I still use Red's lines "la la la la la la etc............." Keenan Wynn is great as usual....Even at that...let's compare a little..... This movie is IN COLOR....and it has great credit art by Norman Rockwell.... I bought the book....don't remember reading it..... maybe it is good..... BUT the book had the portraits of the main characters by Rockwell and the Stagecoach, as does the movie. Very cool. Jerry Goldsmith's music is quite nice and the song Stagecoach to Cheyenne (Pockriss and Vance) and the twangy jews harp..... memorable!Also...Remember, this is just on the verge of the Revolution....when the movies went akilter....the antihero came on etc. This is in the last tier of basic Nice Pleasant movies, when you knew who the good guys were and who the baddies were.... 1966. Italian spaghetti westerns were just being made this year, too. The good writing from the first movie ....the basic plot is still here and it holds together.... This group of people have to or need to go to Cheyenne, even though it could mean attack from Indians. Danger.Slim Pickens is Great as Buck, the Coach Driver and Van Heflin, the co-star of Shane, is fun to see in a western once more,too..... Enjoy!</fullReview>

It has one of the best chase scenes ever, with Indians and Helicopter shots of the racing horses and stage, it has a great performance by Bob Cummings and Kennan Wynn, and I actually felt the hair coming up on the back of my neck during the storm on the cliff, even though I knew it was just a process shot against a painting. It's not Shakespeare, but hey, it's a fun 1960's good ole American film just as TV production values and over lit sound stages were taking over film making and as the last reviewer said, just before the Anti Hero revolution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this version (1966) a few years ago and cannot find it available. I saw it on television. They continue to show the John Wayne version, which is good, but people want variety. Just because some people are so enthused with the Wayne , others should not be deprived of the 1966 movie. besides this version was in color. I owned a DVD of the Wayne version and at this point tired of it. The acting in my opinion is done very well and the characters they portray are very believable. I especially like Ann-Margret's character. and Slim pickens adds a bit of humor. The color and the western scenes are just beautiful. Let those of us who like the 1966 version have it, please. I cannot find it at Best Buy, Tower Records, or anywhere else. What's going on here? THAT'S ABOUT ALL that I have to say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have also seen the 1939 version of "Stagecoach" starring John Wayne and enjoyed it as well. I have also seen a couple of other versions of "Stagecoach". I don't find it difficult to enjoy watching different versions of the same movie or story. Sometimes they are not quite as "good" as earlier or later versions, but they are still fun to watch. Each version of a story has it's own unique qualities and features. Two features that I really, really enjoyed from the 1966 version of "Stagecoach" was it's theme song, sung by Wayne Newton, and the other was the beautiful paintings that Norman Rockwell did of the cast members that were shown at the end of the film. They were magnificent (I would really like to know what was done with them). I remember when "Battlestar Galactica" aired and a lot of people were downing it as not being as good as "Star Wars" and "Star Trek". Needless to say, that upset me a great deal. I like all three of them. Each has their own unique qualities. I just wish people could enjoy each film or show as it comes along and not compare it to death with others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This stylish remake of John Ford's 1939 classic western has everything that the original had except for the Duke. Alex Cord is a decent actor but can hardly fill the shoes of the greatest western actor of all time. Fortunately, the rest of the cast is terrific. Bing Crosby as the besotted doctor more than surpasses Thomas Mitchell and actually manages to steal most of the movie. And the final showdown between the Ringo Kid and the men who killed his father is much more satisfying in this remake than in the original. It's a shame they couldn't of cut John Wayne into this one--it would have made it a near perfect western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For once a sequel worthy of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When I first saw this movie in 1966 I was vaguely aware it was a remake but I had never seen the original. The premise - a group of vivid characters traveling together across Indian territory - is a classic formula. The key to making this work is the casting, which in this case is as perfect as the original. The interplay between Bing Crosby, as the drunken doctor, and Red Buttons, a traveling liquor salesman, is particularly delightful. Bing Crosby had a comedic style that brought out the best in anyone cast as his foil (see Bob Hope) and his performance here is worth the two hours alone. Bob Cummings, the quintessential movie nice guy, is terrific as the nervous thief on the run. Van Heflin and Slim Pickens are exactly the kind of guys you'd want at the reins of a stagecoach making a run for your life. Ann-Margret, Stefanie Powers, Mike Connors and Alex Cord do what they can with parts that were perhaps too closely patterned on the originals. Although movies of this type can at times seem contrived - with events and action occurring at the most inconvenient moments - you have to give a little leeway for dramatic license. Who would want to see a movie where nothing happens? As for the action this movie delivers - the Indian attack and chase scenes through the mountains are every bit as compelling and edge-of-your-seat thrilling as the original. And the music, by Jerry Goldsmith, is a classic in western movie scores - I remember wearing out my soundtrack album of it back in the sixties. Overall, far from being a pale imitation of the original as some have suggested, this movie stands on it's own because of the performances and crackling good direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pale remake of the original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1966) is a pale remake of the original, and mediocre on its own. Actually, I would describe it as a pathetic remake.What most sets the films apart is that there was moral commitment, whether for good or evil, in almost all the characters in the original. There is hardly any from anyone in this remake, whereas this provided the center of the original. There is here little but stereotyped buffoonery with no felt underlying moral stance. The moral setup is also lacking in that Dallas is now simply a dance hall girl unfairly victimized, instead of the prostitute of the original.It would be impossible to reprise John Wayne's role, but, most importantly, he serves as the moral center of the earlier film. Alex Cord, however, is hardly anything but a cardboard, almost after thought presence, in setting the tone in the newer production.Ann-Margaret and Bing Crosby are interesting to see and a cut above the rest of the cast. Van Heflin has presence at the sheriff, and Slim Pickens fulfills his role nicely.Visually and otherwise, Gordon Douglas, the director, is no John Ford. This by itself, however, doesn't account for the great disparity between this remake and the original.It's no accident, imo, that no DVD or VHS of this film is available.**** minor spoilers ****The best sequence in the new film is the chase of the stagecoach. The original's classic rescue by the calvary, however, is replaced with the stagecoach passengers now amazingly holding off the Indians themselves, shooting enough of them to constitute whole tribes.The gunfight at the end is slightly above the standard where one overcomes many. It was, however, a virtue of the original that John Wayne's defeating his three vicious antagonists is off-screen. Better to keep unreality invisible where it can't be plausibly depicted. An understated, and therefore of more consequence, than the stereotyped victory of the good guy while maintaining the requirements, back then, of good triumphing</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Definitely coach, not first class...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original version of this story (made in that year of years, 1939) stands as one of the all time great westerns for many people. Therefore, a remake can only hope to come close to the original's heights and, in this case, it doesn't quite make it. The fairly straightforward story of nine people en route to Cheyenne, Wyoming (in the title mode of transportation) during an Indian uprising isn't exactly monumentally meaningful or complex. It would seem hard to mess it up too badly and this version is OK. It just isn't able to shine as brightly as its predecessor. Boozy doctor Crosby and baby-voiced, skyscraper-haired saloon girl Ann-Margret are driven out of town (after two men, literally, kill themselves trying to dance with her!) They join slick gambler Connors, liquor salesman Buttons, sticky-fingered banker Cummings and pregnant soldier's wife Powers on the coach. Fretful Pickens and determined Marshall Heflin ride on top, eventually picking up Cord along the way. On the plus side, there is some gorgeous scenery, lots of great music, the legendary Norman Rockwell portraits of the cast at the end and good performances from Crosby, Buttons and Pickens. Detriments would have to include the lackluster work of Connors (walking through and never fully realizing his part), Powers (mostly blank and uninteresting) and Cord (alternately wooden and over-dramatic.) Cord (what? was Michael Parks busy?), in particular, is a let down in that he lacks the physical presence to really stand out as the hero of the story. Most of the cast can hardly get a close-up in since so many are devoted to Ann-Margret (who, at 25, was already getting the gauzy, fuzzy treatment in them.) She does an adequate job throughout, though she really only sparkles in her catty scene with Powers when the coach is delayed by a fallen tree. There are certainly worse westerns out there, but this can't begin to approach greatness. Too many of the actors are just marking time and the direction isn't particularly creative. Also, what was revolutionary and trend-setting in 1939 was already becoming cliché by 1966, so the whole thing comes off as a little reheated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Inferior remake by Gordon Douglas , with interesting character studio , passable performances and spectacular outdoors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So-so remake to the considered to be first adult Western , ¨Stagecoach¨ by John Ford that changed the course of the modern Western turning into adult Western and dealing with a motley crew of roles in a cross-country coach beset by Indians and thieves . A voyage throughout Arizona with varied group of characters with nothing in common are stuck together inside a coach , they form a strange assortment of individuals , such as : a prostitute with a broken heart (Anne Margret who received top-billing , in classic rendition interpreted by Claire Trevor) , a coward swank (Red Buttons , anterior acted by Donald Meek), a crooked card-player (Mike Connors , previously by John Carradine) turned into protector to pregnant young wife (Stephanie Powers), a philosopher alcoholic doctor (Bing Crosby-Thomas Mitchell) , a swindler banker (Robert Cummings-Barton Churchill) , a sheriff (Van Johnson , formerly performed by George Bancroft) taking in his prisoner , a sympathetic coach driver (Slim Pickens who bears a remarkable resemblance physical as well as acting to Andy Devine) and Ringo Kid (Alex Cord , priorly by Wayne) , an outlaw looking to revenge killings . The motley crew pull off a journey through Indian territory passing Apache Wells and towards Lordsburg . All of them riding to greatness Across 2,000 miles of flaming frontier . At the beginning they're protected by a military detachment commanded by a brave lieutenant . The stagecoach is besieged by Apaches and several dangers.....The plot is plain and simple , as the story follows a stagecoach ride through Old West Apache territory , portraying in depth characters and brooding events with allegorical issues running beneath surface . Slick edition , nice cinematography and rousing musical score make it an acceptable film , but far from original . Based on the story 'Stage to Lordsburg' by Ernest Haycox and this one based on Guy de Mauspassant's novel . Decent main cast and extraordinary support cast , even the artist Norman Rockwell, famous for his Saturday Evening Post covers, appears as a "townsman" in a brief scene . Outstanding cinematography capturing the nebulous skies by William Clothier and thrilling soundtrack by maestro Jerry Goldsmith . The motion picture was professionally directed by Gordon Douglas , though with no originality . He's an expert on adventures genre , such as ¨Black arrow¨ , ¨Fortunes of Captain Blood¨ , ¨Maru Maru¨ , ¨The Sins of Rachel Cade¨ ; Noir Films and Thrillers as : ¨Tony Rome¨, ¨They call Mr Tibbs¨, ¨Lady in Cement¨, ¨The Detective¨, ¨In like Flint¨, ¨The Falcon in Hollywood¨, ¨Dick Tracy vs Cueball¨ and made a classic Sci-Fi : ¨Them¨ . And , of course , realized lots of Westerns with good actors , as he proved in the films starred by Clint Walker such as ¨Fort Dobbs¨, ¨Yellowstone Kelly¨ , ¨Gold of seven Saints¨ , Gregory Peck as ¨Only the valiant¨ , Richard Boone as ¨Rio Conchos¨ considered the best , ¨Chuka¨ with Rod Taylor , ¨The Nevadan¨ with Randolph Scott , ¨The Charge at Feather River¨, ¨Doolins of Oklahoma¨ , ¨The Great Missouri Raid¨ , among others .The original is a very superior remake in 1939 by John Ford being perfectly played by excellently assembled actors : George Bancroft , Louise Platt , Tom Tyler , Tim Holt and Thomas Mitchell who deservedly won Academy Award for secondary actor , and of course , John Wayne , who arose his career languishing in Poverty Row and being first pairing of Ford and Wayne . And stunningly shot by John Ford in the mythical Monumental Valley , capturing its particular air , a place that Ford was often to revisit and he befriended Indians tribes . Besides , a forgettable adaptation for TV in 1986 by Ted Post with Willie Nelson , Kris Kristopherson , Johnny Cash , Elizabeth Ashley , Mary Crosby , Tony Franciosa , John Schneider and Kris Kristopherson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sturdy Western Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is no shortage of action in "Rio Conchos" director Gordon Douglas' remake of John Ford's venerable western classic "Stagecoach." Comparatively, the original ran 96 minutes, while the Douglas remake clocks in at 115 minutes. The impressive cast won't make you forget John Wayne, Claire Trevor, and Thomas Mitchell, but they make you believe them. This revenge-driven Twentieth Century Fox release qualifies as an above-average remake. Douglas and "Rio Conchos" scenarist Joseph Landon shun a scene-by-scene remake, but they preserve a lot of Dudley Nichols's dialogue from the 1939 masterpiece. Like the Oscar winning original, this "Stagecoach" remake assembles a number of diverse characters and cramps them within the claustrophobic confines of a stagecoach. The passenger list constitutes a microcosm of nineteenth century society. A pregnant cavalry officer's wife, an amoral Southern gambler, a whiskey drummer, a soused doctor, an ostracized saloon girl, a crooked banker, and a lawman make up this gallery of oddballs. Veteran lenser William Clothier, who shot his share of John Wayne westerns, makes producer Martin Rackin's sumptuous production look larger-than-life. Although it doesn't unfold in scenic Monument Valley like the Ford original, the Twentieth Century Fox remake features its own stunning scenery in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado. Mind you, Douglas isn't the cinematic poet that Ford was. Nevertheless, he is no slouch, and this version of "Stagecoach," the second of three, . Alex Cord appropriates the role that made John Wayne a star. Sexy Ann-Margaret steps into Claire Trevor's role. Bing Cosby steps into Best Supporting Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell's shoes as a drunken doctor. Red Buttons is splendidly cast as the whiskey drummer that Cosby takes advantage of during the trip. Some scenes, particularly the battle with the Native Americans, stand out. "Stagecoach" shows Douglas in fine form.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Tension, Passion, Intensity of purpose - SUPERIOR VERSION!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love John Wayne's bulk and toughness in Stagecoach. He's the epitome of "a man to be reckoned with", but this version (1966) of Stagecoach, starring Alex Cord and Ann-Margaret is definitely worth seeing. In fact, I much prefer this version to John Wayne's... simply because John Wayne (though an exceptional actor in his own right and worthy of all the honors heaped upon him during his career), has always had a tendency to seem a bit "stiff" and it feels as if he "reads" his lines. I love John Wayne, but I've always had trouble watching his westerns because of that. He's definitely not a "love scene" Don Juan and in this version of Stagecoach Alex Cord and Ann-Margaret play up the love interest very effectively. They create a softness to The Ringo Kid (Alex Cord) that needs to be seen for the ending of the movie - the showdown - to be affective. There's an intense tension in this version that is sadly lacking in the original... and that's what makes this version of Stagecoach so great. Prove me wrong... watch it yourself all the way through.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A reason for a remake?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people question why this and other films that we think are great are remade. I don't know about many others, but I did hear about why this one may have been remade.Before there was Cable TV and Movie Classic Channels people like me were at the mercy of TV programmers. We could look through TV Guides or newspapers and hope to find a certain movie would be on and then maybe it was showing at a time we would actually be around to watch it. Didn't have VCR's back then either.Then there were movies that weren't available for TV. Sometimes the powers that be wouldn't allow the movie to be shown on TV because they didn't approve commercials interrupting the director's vision. Sometimes there was other reasons that they weren't available for TV.I heard that the 1939 version of Stagecoach was one these movies. I can't find anything about this online, but I seem to remember hearing it. I do know that I didn't see the 1939 version till sometime in the 1990's. I see it was re-released in 1996.So, if people were deprived of seeing the original, then I can see why a remake was done and they didn't do a bad job either. I had put off seeing the 1966 version simply because the original is readily available and played frequently on TV here. I got to see it today and it in no way comes close to the original, but it isn't anything that anyone connected to it need be embarrassed about.As for other classics being remade in this day and age when the originals are easily available, well, Don't even get me started on that tangent, makes me want to pick up my Winchester and ride the Stagecoach into Indian Territory!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Good remake of the John Wayne film. While this is not the best western I've ever seen, it did have some of the most exciting scenes around. I really enjoyed the comic relief of Bing Crosby as the boozed out doctor, Red Buttons as the misunderstood drummer, and Bob Cummings playing the frantic embezzler. Good performances by the entire cast kept the show going right along, and the 2 big shoot-outs near the end were dandies. I really liked the part when Alex Cord came crashing through the window of the saloon and a large piece of plastic remained quivering in the frame.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This remake is a treasure due to the fabulous cast. Very interesting performances by Bing Crosby as the drunken doctor, Oscar winner Red Buttons as the Whiskey drummer, Slim Pickens as the stagecoach driver, Bob Cummings as the bank clerk with a secret and Keenan Wynn is frighteningly evil. The lovely Ann-Margret in an early role as the beautiful dance hall girl Dallas. Alex Cord is sexy and mysterious as Ringo. This is my favorite Stagecoach. Norman Rockwell does the paintings and appears in a cameo. Theme song by Wayne Newton. This film is also gorgeous with excellent scenery. I found these characters stayed in my memory for many years. Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It lacks the magic touch of John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Similar cast of characters as its 1939 namesake. But only Bing Crosby as Doc Boone really shines among the passengers on this stagecoach journey. Van Heflin as the sheriff tried, but was disappointing. Silm Pickens as the stage driver always fits neatly into any western like a well fitting glove. Alec Cord as Ringo was rather wooden in his performance. Ann-Margaret seemed uncomfortable in her role. But to me she has always been a heart-throb. She fits all her other film roles like a smooth silky glove! Just watching her is akin to an art connoisseur staring with total appreciation at any of the world's most beautiful paintings!  But this movie does have something that Ford's 1939 production lacks. And that is crisp outdoor color photography. And let's add to that, Norman Rockwell's excellent portraits of the main characters, which would have been better served with the opening credits instead of at the end. To me, Norman rockwell's paintings are always enjoyable to look at, anytime.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>somebody should have sat down the director of this movie and made him watch the John Wayne original of 1939. This is the worst remake of a classic western ever.Alex Cord is hopeless in the role of Ringo,and to see Bing Crosby and Ann Margret waste their talents in this shocker is too much to bear. I found it impossible to watch after the first 30 minutes,and quickly went to my video shop to rent the original.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was very heartened to read that this wonderful movie has a loyal legion of fans. I agree that it is streets ahead of the overrated original. Alex Cord had charisma in spades - just try to tear your eyes away from him in any scene. Ann-Margret gives a marvellously gritty performance as Dallas,the emotionally battered saloon girl who's scared to hope for a future with Ringo.I caught this on TV in the 80's, taped it, and found myself watching it several times a week for months. I still have the tape and wouldn't dream of erasing it. Hope it comes out on DVD soon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loaded with classic western actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This version was probably made because the original was black and white while this is color. Also, think about the actors: they have been given the opportunity to act in a classic film. And they get paid for it! Cummings deserves a better review... he took the role which was played as a curmudgeonly bank owner out to steal the entire vault of his own bank... as an obsequious and overly polite character; it was a funny takeoff of the original. Alex Cord, alas, could do nothing with his pivotal role of Ringo. Not a good idea to try to take a role so completely 'owned' by John Wayne (directed by John Ford.) I'm watching this version out of curiosity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>pales in comparison, but still worth seeing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach 1939 changed the the story of the western movies. It is a great work of art for what it is, what it was and for what it has been. One might ask what is the point of remaking it since it is practically impossible to attain the same level. This version, directed by Gordon Douglas pales in comparison but at the same time it justifies being made. It is the story of the outcasts, the main characters being the whore and the convict where the wild west will provide a new life, without the stigma of society. A world of the past, which does not exist anymore and creates a feeling of nostalgia. The stagecoach itself, pulled by many horses, going through the beautiful colored scenery is the star of the film. Ann Margret is no Claire Trevor and neither Alex Cord, John Wayne, but they do their parts competently. Bing Crosby and Red Buttons are not at their best, but Stefanie Powers, Robert Cummings, Van Heflin and Slim Pickens are excellent. I enjoyed the action scenes, quite a lot of them, more than on the original version. A good western, quite enjoyable, worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>its a wash</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I agree with other posters who say that this is nowhere near the original. I also agree with the poster who said that John Wayne would have made a perfect movie.When watching this movie I couldnt help but picture the actors from the original. However, I think both Slim Pickens and Van Hefflin are at least equal to their predessors. I also felt that Bing Crosby was outstanding, even though I thought the original actor (his name escapes me) was terriffic. I missed John Carradine very much. His replacement doesnt even come close.The main difference in this movie is that it is carried more evenly by the cast. In the original, John Wayne was a superstar and his prescence took over the film. This movie is kind of like the Chicago Bulls without Michael Jordan, and Alex Cord is Scottie Pippen. They were a good team, but they never won without MichaelP.S. I apologize for my spelling but it's late and I want to finish this post before i forget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dreadful excuse for a western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Poorly-written remake of the 1939 John Wayne chestnut has stagecoach full of disparate people encountering personal strife and drama on the treacherous route to Cheyenne. Since the characters are such an obvious lot (what with a prostitute, a pregnant woman, a bank robber, a wily alcoholic, an outlaw, etc.) and are written and portrayed as caricatures, there's nobody here to care about. Newcomer Alex Cord broods mightily as the outlaw, but this actorly process of cool non-projection is a snooze by now; Ann-Margret, as the saloon girl with the shady life, is only comfortable in her carefully-posed close-ups, her line readings rendered false by a peculiarly twangy accent and no conviction in her behavior (she reverts too easily on being 'lewd' without giving the character any other dimensions). The direction is sloppy, the pacing leaden, and even the Colorado scenery fails to enliven the proceedings. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach - another version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It takes courage to make a new movie based on a story so well developed in 1939 by John Ford and starring John Wayne so magnificent, but Gordon Douglas decided to take the project forward and the result was not bad. The cast except Mike Connors and Bob Cummings (bad bad bad) is very good, especially Bing Crosby and Ann-Margret. Alex Cord is not up to John Wayne did not disappoint. It has good stage presence and fulfills its role. The final scenes, so different from its predecessor are explicit, while in 1939, John Ford chose to hide details of the final confrontation. Finally a movie is interesting and should be considered. It has more positives than negatives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Far and away The Best Stagecoach version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know what to say about the taste of those who like the 1939 version of this movie. The original version just flat SUCKS. The acting of Wayne sucks, and everyone but Andy Devine as Buck stunk it up (even John Carradine as McCoy, Mike Connors showed him how it's done in the 1966 version). There is nothing, I mean nothing, even remotely worth watching in the original, once was all I could stomach of it. The ending was gawd-awful; the Luke Plummer character was a sniveling coward. Keenan Wynn's Luke Plummer was sensational, and the ending in the 1966 version was light-years ahead of the 1939 version. All the actors and acting is infinitely better in this version. With the possible exceptions of McClintock, The Conqueror and The Green Berets, Stagecoach is hands-down the worst movie John Wayne ever made. Even the 1986 version is better than the 1939 one, and it sucks too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When ever one watches a remake of a film, one always wants a movie that advances on prior treatment of the subject. The original movie was about unspoken prejudice, but for some reason the makers of this film wanted it to be a pointed film. Making Ann-Margaret's Dallas to be only a bar hall girl not the prostitute of the original. For some absurd reason Dallas is kicked out of town because she was the reason for a quarrel between two men that ended in a killing. So now Dallas hates the Army....The mystery of the characters is not to be found...they are now a stereo-typed. They all now have met and have preconceived animosity instead of creating relationships good or bad. Bing Crosby's doctor is terrible, Alex Cord as the Ringo Kid is flat and lifeless; Red Buttons attempting to be a frightened and shy person is way beyond his capacity to play Mr. Peacock. Finally, Mike Conner's can in no way hold a candle to the acting of Carradine. Also, Curly the sheriff is in it for the money and not a character of law and order but of selfishness. Sad to see that this film ever made it to the screen, it should have stayed unmade.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Minor (First) Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1966)** (out of 4) Ann-Margret, Red Buttons, Alex Cord, Mike Connors, Bing Crosby, Stefanie Powers, Van Heflin and Slim Pickens star in this (first) remake of John Ford's 1939 classic. The storyline is the same as a group of people are traveling across Apache territory trying to put up with one another and fighting off the Indians. Having now seen all three versions of this, I think this one here is the weakest but neither remake can come close to Ford's original. There are some good moments in this film but there's just not enough to really make it worth viewing. There are some noticeable changes here including the fact that this one is in color and comes in a full 2.35:1 ratio, which makes for some interesting cinematography. The color also allows for some great visuals to jump off the screen. Another major change is that we get quite a bit more violence including a terrific opening where some men are attacked by the Indians in a full-on force that includes some surprisingly violent moments including one guy taking a fatal axe to the face. With that said, there's not too much else that works here. The performances are all a mixed bag and that includes Ann-Margaret who is great to look at but she does very little in the role. Buttons and Crosby fit into their roles well but the screenplay really doesn't give them much to work with. Pickens and Heflin add some minor charm but, again, the screenplay offers them very little. The biggest problem with the film is Cord playing the role originally done by John Wayne. I certainly didn't expect him to equal Wayne but his performance is just so wrong for this role and the lack of any real energy or chemistry with Ann-Margret pretty much kills everything. The final couple action scenes aren't too bad but in the end you do have to question why they bothered remaking the film and not trying to do a bit more with it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If the world's thinnest book is "Notable Hollywood Remakes" this one would NOT be between the covers! There are some pictures that just should not be 'remade'..."Night of the Hunter" (1955) is another example of an abysmal attempt to improve on perfection. In this version of "Stagecoach" the makers have taken the lean, literate tale of danger, romance and revenge, and convoluted it until viewers are screaming "Who cares!!" And what do you suppose the studio moguls were smoking when they decided to cast Alex Cord in the lead role of Ringo? It must be said, in the nature of fairness that past-their-primers Heflin, Cummings, and Crosby supplement thier social security checks admirably. And of course we have the "Legend" that surrounds this picture . . . that the studio, in an attempt to prevent box-office distractions, scooped up, and destroyed all existing copies of the 1939 Ford/Wayne classic . . .and it was only because Wayne had a personal copy of the movie at home in a safe, that we can still see the superior, earlier picture. This is one pitiful movie.</fullReview>
