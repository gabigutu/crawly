		<shortDescription>Sad. Very, very sad . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movies just shouldn't be remade. Gone With the Wind, Casablanca . . . and Stagecoach. For some reason, though, Hollywood can't keep its hands off it. It was remade (badly) in 1966, and this one is even worse. It looks like a bunch of wannabe cowboys with some money decided they could make a western better than John Ford could (Willie Nelson was the executive producer of this), and they couldn't possibly have been more wrong. Everything, absolutely EVERYTHING, about this movie is pathetic. Ted Post is normally a first-rate director, especially of westerns (he did most of the "Rawhide" series with Clint Eastwood), but he either had a really bad day, or (what seems to be more likely) everyone in the cast simply ignored what he told them; there doesn't appear to be any discipline at all in this film. Everybody keeps trying to out-ham everyone else, or they're either so laid-back they're practically comatose. The photography isn't particularly good, the editing is horrendous, the scenery around Old Tucson (where this was shot) is completely wasted . . . and on and on. A really sad waste of time and money. Skip it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>doesn't hold a candle to the John Ford/John Wayne original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>this is(a far as i can tell)the third version of the classic movie first directed in 1939 by John Ford and starring John Wayne.i haven't seen the second film(1966)so i can't comment on that one.this 1986 version though,i can comment on.in my mind,it doesn't come near to the original,which is a classic,and one of the best movies i have seen.this version has in many of the starring roles,Country and western singers of the era,including Willie Nelson,Waylon Jennings,Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson.also in the cast are John Schneider(TV's Dukes of Hazard),June Carter Cash,Jessi Colter(wife of Waylon Jennings),and Mary Crosby(TV's Dallas)the movie was an entertaining diversion,but the acting was underwhelming.The only decent performance of the bunch came from Kristofferson.most of the dialogue wasn't that great,either,including a lot of one or two word conversations.and what was up with Mary Crosby and those lips,which looked like she'd had an allergic reaction to peanuts or shellfish,or something.either way,it looked stupid.the movie was also slow,with not much happening of any consequence,and almost zero character development.when it was over,i was indifferent to it.it's nothing memorable and will probably have faded from my mind in a day or so.still,if you have nothing better to do,it passes about 90 minutes or so.for me Stagecoach(1986)is a 6/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Explosive remake of the classic John Wayne film.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie once and I've wanted to see it again for a long time. I thought it was great, especially with an all-star, country legends cast. Willie Nelson and Kris Kristopherson have an automatic explosive chemistry together that works to their advantage. Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings, though both have sadly passed now, shall continue to amaze viewers for generations with their high-handed, traditional, western attitudes and sharp wit and sarcastic remarks. June Carter Cash is sassy and blunt (jus like they was in them IL' days). John Schneider is incredibly hot and sexy as a driver and might have been a bit hot=headed, though like i said, i only saw it once. it's not that hard to believe he plays the famous Bo Duke on the The Dukes of Hazzard (the original). Director Ted Post has expertly endeavored to make a wonderful classic come back to life. Stagecoach is one movie I'll not soon forget. i'll be sure to buy it sometime and make sure my own kids appreciate it as much as i did, and still do.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Waste of the stars talents</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With great country stars like Johnny Cash, Willie Nelson, Kris Krisofferson, and Waylon Jennings; not to mention June Carter Cash and not having one good song makes about as much sense as Harrison Ford, Kevin Costner, Tom Hanks and Tom Cruise hosting the Grand Old Opera. The only one of the four who can really act is Willie. If it would have been more like "Red Headed Stranger," with a few songs like "Red man don't take my scalp," "Forty miles to water," or "My butt gets sore in this old stagecoach," would have helped. This remake of the great, classic, John Ford original was a total failure. Mostly for the reason given above. I believe a great movie cannot be remade. This is proof.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Feel sorry for the actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(SPOILERS THROUGHOUT)I recently read an article concerning the movie, then watched it. I must agree with the article. It mentions how the actors/singers were extremely dissapointed in the script when they did the movie. I heartily agree. The base story is all right for your typical western. It involves the trials and tribulations of a particular stagecoach run. Almost every person on the coach, their lives somehow become intertwined with the other's, in more ways than just the ride. Some of the characters are "famous" from the old west (Doc Holliday, Ringo), and others are general cardboard cutouts of people we've seen in other westerns (the gambler, the marshal, the soiled dove, the helpless lady, the "greedy one"). I personally thought that was fine. However, it went downhill with the SCRIPT ITSELF. I've never heard more long, drawn-out, windy speeches in my life! Almost everyone has some speech that, when spoken, means you're supposed to drop everything and listen in awe. Each speech is supposed to be some moral awakener. What's worse? Every other line spoken is one of those speeches! I will give the movie credit though-there are some funny parts. (SPOILER) The best: the Marshall and stagedriver debating who will talk to Doc about a certain matter (watch the movie and find out!) I also enjoyed seeing some of my favorite singers/actors together. I'll never get enough of the Highwaymen (may Mr. Cash and Mr. Jennings rest in peace). Overall (out of 10): 5. 0 for the speeches, 5 for the rest.</fullReview>

The Cast; Johnny Cash, Waylon Jennings's, Willie Nelson and company were legends of country music, were brought together by Jack Thompson to remake the original John Ford/John Wayne Classic for television. It received the highest ratings for its time slot when it first aired in 1986.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you haven't seen the 1939 original directed by John Ford to make the comparison, this film doesn't stack up too badly. It pretty much follows the script of the earlier movie, with characters who remain mostly the same with a couple of minor variations. Willie Nelson's Doc Holliday is the notable exception, appearing here with fellow country music legends Waylon Jennings, Johnny Cash and Kris Kristofferson. Seeing as how as an actor, Kristofferson is no John Wayne, it wasn't surprising that his entrance as The Ringo Kid didn't have the same high drama as that of Wayne's Ringo. The stakes weren't as high either, "Stagecoach" was the film that launched Wayne's career after only about fifty other films prior that he appeared in.The picture could probably have used a bit more humor to liven things up a bit. One of the things that impressed me about the original "Stagecoach" was how most of the characters started out as caricatures and wound up being people you either cared about, or so repulsive that you wanted to see them get what was coming to them. I didn't get the same sense of that here, as most likely, the celebrity status of the principals kept intruding on their portrayals. I thought Willie Nelson did the best job in his role as Doc Holliday, by contrast I felt Johnny Cash was rather bland as Marshal Curly Wilcox. Waylon Jennings was OK as gambler Hatfield, while Kristofferson's take on the Ringo Kid seemed watered down by his relationship with reformed hooker Dallas (Elizabeth Ashley). It didn't help that the chemistry between them seemed non-existent, except for Ashley's swooning eyes whenever she gazed on The Kid.So if I'm forced to make the call, I'd say see the original "Stagecoach" at some point, but if you're a fan of any of the principals, I don't think you'll come away disappointed. You might even learn a thing or two from the likes of Doc Holliday, like washing your hands with whiskey before delivering a baby. It's supposed to kill germs, right?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Substandard script with substandard acting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching this film, I was really wanting to enjoy the experience. All my favorite country singers were assembled into a cast that would make any fan of music quiver with anticipation. But soon into the film it was obvious that the quiver turned into shivers as most of the acting was low-quality.The idea for the story was actually a nice idea. But what was missing was someone that could write a teleplay that would bring the idea to life and make the story interesting. In this movie, nothing seemed to gel. The writing was weak and the words delivered by people that really were not actors.Johnny Cash, who is one of my all time favorite singers, was stiff as a board and seemed to be reading the lines with little, if any, emotion. Willie Nelson was nearly shameful playing Doc Holliday and having him deliver a baby was absolutely embarrassing and painful to watch. Throw in Waylon Jennings that seemed mortified to be on camera and you have a cast that brings nothing to the table. With the weak script and the poor acting- this movie never had a chance.I will credit Kris Kristofferson, John Schneider and Elizabeth Ashley with their acting ability as they are the bright spots in this dismal cast. Even Anthony Newley and Mary Crosby did a nice job with their character but it was not enough to help the unfortunate situation.It was a movie I so wanted to enjoy but felt uncomfortable the entire time. Not sure anything could have helped this troubled project.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Improves as time passes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When the movie was first made virtually the entire cast was very familiar and it was difficult to see the people as their characters since they were so famous. Now that time has passed I watched it again and found it very enjoyable. The movie is a remake of the John Wayne classic and when it came out that version was still being played on TV and was popular on DVDs. Since then a flood of other movies have come out and made that one a little more distant. I love the John Wayne-John Ford version and this one sticks pretty close to that story but with the "Highwaymen" taking 4 of the lead roles. It's a really interesting cast with lots of family and friends popping in for small parts.The basic story of a group of people wanting to get across a piece of country where Apaches have been raiding. They have different reasons revenge, wanting to repay old debts, escaping from the law, running from the past, etc.There are changes from the original as the doctor (Willie Nelson) is now Doc Holiday rather than the town drunk. The gambler (Waylon Jennings) is openly a card shark with a very shady past rather than the rigid southern gentleman.The stagecoach crew has to contend with many problems and the story never lags. There is a nice "Hollywood ending" but that was fine with me.If you feel like sitting back and enjoying a modern "B" western this is a good one. It's a throwback to the old TV Westerns like Gunsmoke and does a very good job of it!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Who exactly is this.. Geraldo.. fellow?"Mr A.Newley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In "Stagecoach" the late Mr T.Post treads a difficult line between the original Ernest Haycox story "Stage to Lordsburg" with it's frontier values and the rather more liberal views of a mid 1980s audience to some of whom Geronimo might appear to be a freedom fighter rather than a brutish savage. His voice is articulated by Mr W.Nelson,one of the most significant Country artists of the 20th century who appears slightly uncomfortable as "Doc" Holliday,a man plucked from history to be the conscience of the movie. Having appeased contemporary sensibilities,Mr Post goes pretty much down the traditional Western road with a brave if not very bright lawman (Mr J.Cash),a bar girl (Miss E.Ashley),a gambler(Mr W.Jennings) and that most revered of American figures a pregnant lady(Miss M.Crosby) amongst others travelling on a stagecoach through Apache territory. It's a pleasing enough picture that lovers of TV Westerns should enjoy. There are some funny lines,many of which are deftly handled by Mr A.Newley as an itinerant whisky salesman,a role in which he was allowed to retain his English accent.Half - hearing a conversation about Geronimo,he says.."Excuse me..who exactly is this ..Geraldo.. fellow?" a line which,if spoken in American would have been meaningless but as he says it immediately brings to mind that most determinedly English of English bandleaders. Unfortunately,Mr Newley is whisked away in such haste as to almost appear rude,and the picture is rather diminished by his going. Nonetheless the second half is enlivened by the appearance of Mr K.Kristofferson as the Ringo Kid and he is twinkly but determined to get his vengeance on those who murdered his brothers. This is all good TV Movie stuff and my generation can sigh at the appearance of Mr L.Larue whose adventures at the Saturday Morning Pictures set many an 8 year - old heart a - flutter. You don't have to love Country Music to enjoy "Stagecoach" but it sure doesn't harm in any either.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Ain't Broke...Don't Fix It!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Around the time this film was made, stars Willie Nelson, Kris Kristofferson, Johnny Cash and Waylon Jennings were performing concerts as "The Highwaymen" and they were good. So, having success as a performing group Nelson thought..."Why not make a movie together." Well sir, the one Willie chose (as Executive Producer) was a re make of the classic John Ford film "Stagecoach".By now any movie goer worth his salt knows the story line of "Stagecoach"....a group of unlikely travelers taking the stage to Lordsburg through hostile Indian territory. Veteran TV director Ted Post follows the original story to a point.The major difference is in the casting of the "Doc" character. In the original, Doc was a boozy reprobate on the make for his next drink. Willie Nelson however chose to play the character as "Doc" Holliday...yes THAT Doc Holliday complete with a pair of six guns and a brazen attitude. That made the character of Peacock the whiskey salesman (Anthony Newley) totally irrelevant so he quickly exits the story.The rest of the characters stick to the original. Kris Kristofferson plays Ringo, Johnny Cash, Curly the Marshal, Waylon Jennings the gambler Hatfield and John Schneider, Buck the stagecoach driver. Others in the cast include Tony Franciosa as Gatewood the banker, Elizabeth Ashley as Dallas the saloon girl and Mary Crosby as a very pregnant Lucy Mallory.Director post keeps the story moving and the action flowing. The Indian attack is well staged although without veteran stunt man Yakima Canutt, the stagecoach stunt work suffers in comparison. The final showdown with Luke Plummer (Alex Kubils) is changed somewhat to include all of the Highwaymen.As actors, one could say that the four principals made great singers although they do carry off their respective parts as best they could. Others in the country music oriented cast include June Carter Cash and son John Carter Cash as proprietors of a relay station, David Allen Coe as one of the Plummers, Billy Swan as a bartender and Jennings' wife Jessi Colter in a minor role. And for the old timers among you, there's a brief appearance in the Plummer sequence by veteran cowboy hero Lash LaRue.Given that this was a TV movie and the violence toned down somewhat, the boys give us a pleasant if not entertaining old style western. But because it tries to re-make a classic, it suffers in comparison. It just shows to go ya that "If it ain't broke, don't fix it".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent Fun with the Singers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1986) ** (out of 4) Made-for-TV remake of John Ford's classic 1939 film is pretty lifeless from start to finish but fans of country music (or at least the actors here) will find some mild entertainment to be had. Willie Nelson (Doc Holliday), Kris Kristopherson (Ringo Kid), Johnny Cash (Marshal Curly Wilcox) and Waylon Jennings (Hatfield) lead the stagecoach into Apache territory where Geronimo is wanting some scalps. I'm somewhat shocked that they even bothered calling this STAGECOACH as it owes very little to the John Ford film. Sure, the entire set up is the same but it seems this film was more interesting in dialogue than any sort of action or drama. I think a lot of people will hate this movie with a passion or turn it off at the half way point unless they're fans of the cast and if that's the case they'll probably be able to make it through simply on their charm. I've always found Cash to be a fairly good actor (see THE GUNFIGHT with Kirk Douglas) and he clearly steals the film with his down to earth qualities that really come off quite charming. I think he fit the role perfectly well and there's not a second where you see Johnny Cash but instead you see the character. Kristopherson also comes off pretty well as he should since he's the most credited member of the cast. Nelson, as Doc Holliday, isn't going to go down as one of the greatest to ever play the role but he's not too bad and he does manage to get a few laughs with that dry sense of humor. Jennings doesn't get as good of a role but he's not too bad either. Fans of the Ford film really shouldn't compare the two movies as they're clearly both trying to do something different. This film here just wants to be fun and the cast delivers that but I think the screenplay is still full of holes and I have to wonder why they waited until the very end of a 100-minute movie to throw in some action. I think the film would have been better had some been sprinkled in towards the start of the film. With that said, country music fans will certainly want to see these legends acting together in one film and we even get the title song sung by Nelson. Look fast for other country folks including June Carter Cash and David Allan Coe.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great movie IF you pretend it wasn't Ford's version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you liked Silverado-an homage to the old B's with a bit of an edge, this movie is for you. If you are a woman over 45 and want a little romance in your life, this movie is for you. If you think it is a hoot to see some truly great entertainers tying one on in a great old western, this movie is truly for you. (And if you see this review and have also seen the movie...please let me know when Lash LaRue appeared 'cause somewhere I must have gone to replenish the popcorn and missed him-darn it!) What was a hoot was seeing Kris Kristofferson not a day over 50 when this was shot playing Johnny Ringo which, if they were worried about playing it close to the '36 version-would have picked someone two and a half decades younger..., romancing Elizabeth Ashley, not a day over 46, playing a girl of 30. The minute this pairing occurred you knew they weren't trying in the least to cater to the original; they were out to have a lot of fun! And it was. Tony Franciosa was wonderfully hypocritically nasty as the banker; Waylon Jennings was super as the Gambler, Hatfield; and for all the world no one would recognize the gorgeous John Schneider, a Hazzard Duke, as the stage driver Buck without a program.John Carter Cash, son of June and Johnny even seemed real and both mom and dad were equally convincing. But the tour de force went to Willie Nelson playing Doc Holliday (yet another hint that they weren't trying for the original version). He was so good and believable as the hero of Tombstone...yet every so often had a deer-in-the-headlights look about him...especially when he finds out he is to be an obstetrician! All in all, for sheer entertainment and a lot of fun-especially if you are an aficionado of old westerns-this was a FUN movie!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It stand fine on its OWN</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It seems most reviewers are impotent to view and comment on artistic work on its merit. They remain cognizant of previous works with the same title and their innate objectivity [if they had any] goes screaming out the door.This work if being compared, should be compared to earlier works by these singers .... er actors. I've seen Johnny Cash so stiff and stoic he appears like a page in a dull novel. Here he comes to life and is really believable in his role. The writers gave these people lines that they rarely muffed or failed to deliver with absolute perfect clarity and hesitancy if orchestrated that way. I was so impressed with the writing I made a bee line to see who the writers were. I was amazed I must tell you it gave me more appreciation for the artistic work of these singers in their second at least not primary, chosen area of labor. Any objective person who wants to enjoy a western movie can relish and savor this to the penultimate if he or she sits with NO preoccupation with the title, how many times done before and who might have played the parts. Bring innocent objectivity to your seat and then sit down and savor a well done movie [arguably the BEST ever done] by these talented artists who are not working in their primary field but skillfully put their varied abilities to the test on the big screen which is unrelenting enough of mistakes without someone sitting there with the preoccupied thought of seeing what doesn't compare with 1939. Its a winner if YOU can be objective.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The way a remake ought to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start? Well, it's a good movie. Very good. And not a 100% shot by shot remake of the 1939 John Ford story. Events closely mirror the 1939 film, but are changed up, almost entirely for the better, so even if you've seen the 1939 film, it's like you're watching a different movie because you're never quite sure what will be included and what will change from the original. In general, the changes are almost all more naturalistic. Without giving spoilers, I will say that Mr. Peacock gets a chance to leave the stagecoach at the first stop, preventing the story from having to carry on the deadweight of an unwilling passenger who has no reason to take the dangerous trip, Buck is changed from the cowardly moron he was in the 1939 film to more of an every-man, and Curley Wilcox is a more compassionate, sensible man, instead of the guy dragging everyone along like he seemed in the 1939 film. The 1939 film was good in its own right, and a classic, but that's no reason to skip over the fact that it had plot holes. My hat goes off to the writers of this movie, who changed it so it's the same basic story, but people act more logically and events happen more naturally. Plus, the dialogue was good. Willie Nelson and Johnny Cash stole the spotlight as the only really recognizable actors (well, musician-actors), but the other, less recognizable actors in the movie held up quite well. And, particularly in the middle of the movie, there were several conversations with laugh-out-loud funny parts in them (at least I thought so!).Now, for why I'd rate it a 9 out of 10 instead of 10. First, I thought changing Doc in the original to Doc Holiday, on his way to Tombstone, was kind of contrived and gimmicky. Second, the movie was a bit lower budget by comparison to the 1939 film, and it had less cinematography and less music (it seemed like there was only one tune in the movie, the one made by Willie Nelson), but that was only a minor disappointment. And third, the conversations between Dallas and Ringo were only so-so, and I felt like Curley and Buck had a more meaningful relationship than they did.But those are just minor quibbles. If you haven't seen John Woo's 1939 movie Stagecoach, you won't be lost watching this movie. And if you have seen his 1939 film, this film is an improvement and a new story, which will keep you guessing what will happen next from beginning to end. Either way, this movie is well worth your money if you see it as a triple-feature DVD in the Wal-Mart Bargain Bin like I did.</fullReview>
