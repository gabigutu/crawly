		<shortDescription>A great western which enables multiple interpretations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne is "The Ringo Kid" in this John Ford-directed parable of outcasts traveling towards various kinds of figurative and literal redemption/salvation. On a surface level, the basic plot is disarmingly simple--a motley crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg, trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on the way. They are having their own problems with the U.S. government and are thus likely to attack. The stagecoach bounces from outpost to outpost while the relationships of its passengers evolve, helping each other to "find themselves" and (usually) providing hope of some kind of new life.The Ringo Kid has been wrongly accused of a crime and is on his way to Lordsburg to avenge both the false accusations and more importantly, the murder of his father and brother. Dallas (Claire Trevor) is implied to be a prostitute, and so is ostracized from Tonto (which means "stupid", "foolish" or "daft" in Spanish) by a self-stylized matronly moral majority. Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) is far more concerned with getting drunk than being a doctor, and is partially ostracizing himself from Tonto. Hatfield (John Carradine) is a "gambler gentleman" with a shady reputation and a false identity. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is trying to get to her husband, who is in the military; she's in a surprisingly "secret" physical state. Samuel Peacock, whom everyone keeps mistaking for a reverend, is in the alcohol business and just wants to get back east to get back to his business. Henry Gatewood is a crooked banker trying to flee before his questionable dealings are discovered. And the stagecoach drivers consist of a lovable buffoon, Buck (Andy Devine) and the most forthright, straight arrow of the bunch, Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft).Even though Stagecoach remains tightly focused on its wilderness road trip, that might seem like a large stable of characters to shape into a taut plot. Ford, working from script by Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht, based on a short story, "Stage to Lordsburg", by Ernest Haycox (which itself bears a relation to Guy de Maupassant's "Boule de Suif", 1880), keeps the proceedings in check by only giving us the information we need to explore the evolving relationships, and only focusing on each character when they're important to the plot. This results in a few of the characters being functionally absent for extended lengths of time, but Ford can so easily establish a "deep" character with a minimum of screen time that the absences are not a detriment.The principal focus, of course, is between Ringo and Dallas, as on a significant level, Stagecoach becomes a romance. They're initially brought together via their mutual ostracization, even among the ostracized, which gives them an immediate bond beyond their physical attraction towards one another. Wayne and Trevor are both fantastic in their roles, avoiding the occasional overacting by some other performers. But this is a film where it's difficult to count the slight overacting as a flaw, as it was more of a stylistic tendency of the genre during this period and it provides a nice counterbalance to Wayne and Trevor.Stagecoach is also famous for its setting. Much of the film was shot in Utah's Monument Valley, along authentic stagecoach "roads". The (beautiful) starkness of the desert is often taken as a symbolic trip through a kind of purgatory for the characters, where they're left alone with their souls, their only connection being their small group, to contemplate their pasts and futures. Whether we choose to read something along those lines into the film or not, Monument Valley is at least a captivating presence in the film, although for me, the cinematography could have been better technically, especially considering that Stagecoach was made at the same time as The Wizard of Oz (1939). Ford's famous tendency to do only one take results in a couple minor gaffes, such as the initial shot of John Wayne--a zoom into a close-up--that is out of focus for most of the zoom.As one could guess, eventually our passengers run into a band of Apaches, who are often interpreted as representing more of a "natural force" that our heroes must surmount. The climax features a fabulous extended chase/fight sequence with a number of amazing stunts by both humans and animals. The most impressive human stunts are performed by the legendary Yakima Canutt, including one that involved being dragged through the dirt by the horse-pulled stagecoach, which was moving along at about 40 miles per hour and supposedly missed running over Canutt by only 12 inches (30.5 cm). This scene was an inspiration for a similar stunt in Steven Spielberg's Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981).Although it's not a "perfect" film to me, and it's not even my favorite western (I'm more partial to the classic spaghetti westerns, for example), Stagecoach is a very good film and was very influential, despite being made at a time when Ford was told that he was committing professional suicide by even contemplating a western. As the plethora of critical literature attests, it works on many levels, including as an allegorical microcosm of U.S. Depression-era society, and should be seen at least once by anyone serious about film literacy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The classic film that started it all.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Overland Stage Lines stagecoach is traveling from the frontier town of Tonto, Arizona to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Geronimo, the Apache chief, has just jumped the reservation and starts an uprising. Before leaving Tonto, the passengers are notified by the Calvary that they are now traveling at their own considerable risk but they will be escorted by the soldiers (here's a clue: don't believe it). Among the passengers are a prostitute being thrown out of town by a group of women with their noses so stuck up in the air you could fly flags off of them. She is joined by a drunken doctor, a gentlemen card shark, a meek whiskey salesman, a crooked banker, a pregnant woman on her way to meet her husband, and a young cowboy who just broke out of jail and out to revenge his family's murder. The coach driver and his shotgun complete the group. It's all based on a short story called appropriately Stage to Lordsburg but also on a French story (Guy de Maupassant's Boule de Suif) with similar characters traveling in a coach during the Franco-Prussian War.The basic structure of the plot is also familiar to fans of disaster films. Passengers are introduced, board a common conveyance and face a tremendous danger. The exciting adventure of who lives, who dies, will the stage make it to its destination, and what happens next is highlighted by perhaps the most famous stunts in film history by the most famous and respected stuntman of all Yakima Canutt. If one of the stunts looks familiar, Steven Speilberg recreated it for his first Indiana Jones film. The film is also a lot more. Unlike other westerns up to its time which were mainly shoot-em-ups between the good guys in the white hats and the bad guys in the black hats, it examines very serious social issues and how different people look down at others differently. Besides prejudice, some of the characters are flawed with alcoholism, greed and revenge. We also see the good in bad people with respect for new life and ultimately redemption. Nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, Best Supporting Actor (won) and Best Score (won), Stagecoach was John Ford's first sound Western and elevated the genre in both critical praise and popularity. The low camera angles in Monument Valley would become a John Ford trademark. Despite doing 70 films, this is the one that made Wayne a star and it's easy to see why. Many consider it his best performance; both subtle and clear he cares for the needs of the people around him and yearns for his own need for a home, a wife and a family. It is considered one of the great films in cinemas greatest year, 1939. Gone With the Wind, Goodbye Mr. Chips, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Wuthering Heights, Dark Victory, The Wizard of Oz, Of Mice and Men and Ninotchka were all nominated for best picture alongside Stagecoach that year.Regarding the political incorrectness of an Apache uprising, well, they happened. If you just happened to be in a stagecoach in the middle of the southwest during an Apache uprising chances are you would be killed. This story does not examine the reasons for the uprising only the effects on a group of travelers trying to travel through it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great ensemble western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching the old, crotchety, gruff John Wayne, the iconic hero of the right wing, and even though I'd seen some of his early films on television, I'd forgotten what a sexy and compelling presence he had when a young man. It's easy to see while watching his performance how this film made him a star. As great as Wayne is in this film, he doesn't overshadow any of his fellow performers. Thomas Mitchell plays the drunken doctor thrown out of town, a performance that earned him an Academy Award. Andy Devine is hilarious as the complaining, squeaky voiced stagecoach driver. John Carradine is sleek and snake-like as the gambler. Claire Trevor gives a heartbreaking turn as the good-hearted whore thrown out of town by pious hypocrites. Donald Meek plays his name, a meek whiskey salesman befriended by the whiskey-loving Doc. Each actor quickly and deftly sketches his character so vividly that every performance is memorable.But the real star of the show is John Ford, the director. To introduce and define nine characters in the context of a fast-paced western is no easy task, and he accomplishes it in masterly fashion. Much of the action takes place in the limited confines of a stagecoach, but Ford takes advantage of the limits by staging brilliant and subtle bits between characters; John Wayne casts sultry glances at Clare Trevor, who blossoms under his glance, the young calvary wife's eyes glaze over as the banker pontificates, and Doc sneaks sips of whiskey from the samples case while he solicitously keeps the wind from chilling the whiskey salesman. When the action moves outside, he films the action in dynamic angles and stunts that were the most daring of its time.If you enjoy westerns and haven't seen this, you have a great night of film-watching ahead of you. And if the last time you saw Stagecoach was some midnight years ago when you wandered home for a bit of the late show before bedtime, watch it again and rediscover what a great western it is</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Over the rise, it's the Duke, Winchester in hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite movie shots of all time comes in Stagecoach when the coach rounds a bend and you see a figure in the distance and has the camera zooms in closer you recognize it as John Wayne, saddle in one hand and winchester rifle in the other.Certainly the figure of John Wayne is familiar enough even to today's moviegoers as the man who put more people in theater seats than any other player. But back then in 1939 all he was known as was B picture cowboy who was a friend of John Ford, whom Ford happened to be giving a break to. He sure took advantage of it.Wayne heads an ensemble group of players who are journeying from Tonto to Lordsburg by stagecoach. It is a dramatization of the western novel by Ernest Haycox and John Ford brilliantly cast his film.Anyone of them could have been Oscar material, but one player did win an Oscar, Thomas Mitchell as the alcoholic Doc Boone. 1939 was maybe the highpoint of Mitchell's career. Imagine being in three films nominated for Oscars, Stagecoach, Gone With the Wind, and Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. He could have been nominated for any one of them.On top of the coach is driver Andy Devine and riding shotgun is Marshal George Bancroft. Devine is a befuddled dunce and a lot of reviewers usually pass him over in talking about the film. To be sure he is, but there is a scene where the stagecoach has to cross a deep stream. A pontoon like device is rigged, but it's professional teamster Andy Devine who drives the stage across with his team swimming it. He may be a dunce, but he's a professional at his job. I think it was Andy's moment to shine.Bancroft is a stern but kindly marshal. He and Mitchell are friends of Wayne who plays the Ringo Kid. Wayne's busted out the penitentiary to get the Plummer brothers who framed him. There's a reward for Wayne, but Marshal Bancroft ain't worried about the reward, he's concerned about Wayne getting killed, biting off more than he can chew. However Mitchell spends most of the journey cultivating mild mannered Donald Meek who's a whiskey salesman. A useful friend to have you like to imbibe. If ever a character actor was aptly named it certainly had to be Donald Meek.In 1939 you couldn't say that Claire Trevor was playing a prostitute named Dallas. But it's surely hinted at often enough. Claire Trevor was Hollywood's greatest portrayer of girls with easy virtue and a heart of gold which she has here. She got her Oscar in Key Largo again playing just such a role. The difference is she loves good guy John Wayne instead bad guy Edward G. Robinson in Key Largo.And to add to the mix we have an embezzling banker on the journey played by Berton Churchill who played many a sanctimonious hypocrite in his career. He gets news that the telegraph is down because of the Apaches on the warpath and in an act of impulse fills a satchel full of the bank's money and grabs the stagecoach at the last minute. He's also trying to escape a hatchet faced harridan of a wife. Nevertheless he's the least sympathetic and most useless character on the journey.A few months ago I saw and reviewed the film Carrie which was based on a Theodore Dreiser novel. The lead character in that, George Hurstwood is also an embezzler of his employer's money as he runs away to New York to get away from his harridan of a wife. But Hurstwood, same crime for the same reasons, is a sympathetic figure. Not our friend banker Gatewood as Churchill portrays him here. It some times depends on the writer's point of view.The last two passengers are John Carradine a mysterious gambler of Southern origins and the pregnant wife of an Army Captain played by stage actress Louise Platt. He also boards the stage at the last minute as he's crushing out big time over her. He becomes her protector during the journey.Of course Stagecoach is the first film that John Ford shot in Monument Valley and the long shots of the valley with the lonely stagecoach driving on to Lordsburg are breathtaking. And there's the Indian attack. The question is often asked why didn't the Indians just shoot the horses. The real answer is you wouldn't want to cut short abruptly one of the most spectacular chase scenes in film history. And then of course maybe the Indians wanted the live horses.Ford uses for the first time a spectacular gambit during the Indian attack. I won't say more, but think about the fact that he repeated the same shot in Fort Apache with the Indians chasing John Agar and the repair party there.What I like most about Stagecoach altogether is that it sticks to the first rule of movies, it moves. Even in the scenes of dialog inside the coach you get the feeling of movement. Nothing static about it, and the story could never be adequately done on a stage.It's what movie making is all about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not just a great western but one of the best movies ever made.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach has all the hallmarks of a truly great film.The characters,the direction, the camera work, the scenery, the soundtrack. The story may seem simple but the characters are skillfully developed and colorful. They are real and interesting, not cliches. The desert setting and the stagecoach itself serve to make the great directing and camera work even greater. So many classic scenes in one movie. There are lot of little things like the shot of the coyote howling in the desert night. The shot of the stagecoach from behind going through a sand wash. The shot of the Indians on the hill looking down at the stagecoach. They look real and they look serious. The shot of the "Ringo Kid" watching Mr. Hatfield die.The "Kid" does'nt say a word but you can tell he's thinking about his murdered brother. The very first shot of John Wayne in his very first "A" movie may be his most memorable. Even if you've never seen Stagecoach you have seen that scene of the "Ringo Kid" holding his rifle and saddle while waving down the stage with the Monument Valley as a backdrop. No actor ever had a more spectacular debut. When you here the soundtrack, you can't help thinking about the Old West. John Ford should have won the Oscar for best director. His attention to details make this movie a classic. Classic in the sense that Stagecoach does'nt seem manufactured but seems like something that always was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Grandeur of Monument Valley, Utah, became part of the signature on a John Ford Western...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The remarkable thing about Ford's Westerns is his gift for simultaneously contemplating people as individuals and as representatives of virtues, vices, and other abstract qualities?"Stagecoach" is the Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imagery West with pure entertainment values? It is the Western in which the public first saw Monument Valley, Utah on film ? a place that Ford would revisit again and again, and that became his favorite location for the exterior sequences of his Westerns? It is the first Western to combine successfully the poetic grandeur and sense of myth-making of the real and imaginary West with pure entertainment values... It is so rich it has become a treasury of Western characters and motifs? Prior to 'Stagecoach,' the western was in grievous decline, but with 'Stagecoach' a renaissance occurred..."Stagecoach" makes much capital out of an early means of communication? Ford used it as a symbol ? there is nothing more striking, as an image of loneliness, than a long-shot of a coach twisting its way through the arid and dry South-Western landscape ? but also as a box for shaking and mixing human drama? The combination is devastating? Despite some complaining criticism that there is just a little too much contrivance about the selection of passengers riding in the 'box', that they look as if they've been handpicked for contrast and for drama, "Stagecoach" always repays another look? It still works admirably? Time takes little away from it?Everything seems to fit in "Stagecoach" from the first moment that the camera races in on the imposing figure of John Wayne, a man of heroic size with a powerful stance, twirling his Winchester rifle in one hand to the gallery of colorful portraits in a shaking box to the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade including cloudscapes and silhouettes?Ford carefully selected 'characters' boxed in for a troublesome ride? They are not characters, save perhaps for the drunken doctor, in the usual Ford sense of beloved eccentrics? They are highly contrasted 'types' who, by some alchemy that the movie develops, do grow to some extent into credible human beings?Apart from the drunken Doc (superb1y played by Thomas Mitchell), there's the mysterious southern gambler (John Carradine), a pregnant wife (Louise Platt) joining her soldier husband, a Whisky salesman (Donald Meek) who could kid anyone at first sight?especially an audience?that he's a parson, a whore with a heart of gold (Claire Trevor), and an absconding banker (Barton Churchill). Andy Devine is in the driving seat, George Bancroft, as a U.S. Marshal, rides shot-gun and keeps a wary though fatherly eye on the Ringo Kid (john Wayne) who has come along for at least part of the ride...Two things are at once apparent? Ford is employing a dramatic device for which there is plenty of precedent?compressing diverse characters into a confined and highly charged situation in the certainty of reactions, and, secondly, that the Claire Trevor character is the spitting image, as they say, of Maupassant's tart, Boule de Suife?Geronimo will be the catalyst for this load of combustibles? He's on the loose again and the escorting cavalry have already had to say their farewells to the coach party?Along the way you will also see: The birth of a child, the telegraph lines cut, an attack by Indians, a chase, a cavalry rescue, a poker game, a three-against-one gunfight on the streets of a town, and an exciting climax?"Stagecoach" leaves a whole host of abiding impressions? There is the dramatic black and white photography taking advantage of every trick of light and shade in the wonderful Monument Valley location? It was the first time that Ford had used this setting within the Navajo Indian reservation around and about the Arizona-Utah state dividing line? The eroded lunar landscape has its own beauty and its own menace and these two qualities are reflected in the film? Cloudscapes and silhouettes?these linger on."Stagecoach" bulged with all the required ingredients of the classic Western? It carried a full complement of the historic-pioneering elements and it also made room for that other constituent, the domestic law and order issue?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw Stagecoach the year it was released 1939, when I was nine years old. I saw it again the other afternoon as a rerun on tv. Despite that technically it is showing it's age, afterall it is 63 years old, and all of it's players are no longer with us, it is still one of the greatest westerns to ever grace a cinema screen. The indian attack, the cavalry to the rescue, the drunken doctor, the bar room floozie with a heart of gold, the gambler, and the hero doing "what a man's got to do" and escaping without a scratch . All the ingredients and more of a classic western but done superbly. Not a scene overplayed, not a (film) shot wasted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is not your normal, run of the mill, western. It will have you on the edge of your seat as passengers make their way through some dangerous Indian country. By the time the film ends, you will know all of the characters very well and ,for the most part,care whether they live or die.John Ford's excellent directing, great performances from John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Andy Devine and, especially, Thomas Mitchell who won an Acadamy Award for his portrayal of a drunken doctor aboard the stage. Add a great score, super stunt work, and filming done at Monument Valley (Arizona /Utah border) and you have a complete motion picture. I highly recommend "Stagecoach".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Setting the Stage.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Grand Hotel"-styled Western that puts nine very different people together on the titled vehicle to go across some very dangerous Indian territory. There is convict John Wayne (in his star-making role), scorned prostitute Claire Trevor, drunken doctor Thomas Mitchell (in a well-deserved Oscar-winning role), slick gambler John Carradine, pregnant youngster Louise Platt, shady banker Berton Churchill, whiskey salesman Donald Meek, lawman George Bancroft and driver Andy Devine on this star-studded ride. Soon the characters are turned from would-be stereotypes to very complicated three-dimensional figures that are all deep and humanistic. "Stagecoach" does not only benefit from its actors and screenplay though as legendary director John Ford (Oscar-nominated) shows his ability to mix and mesh quiet, heartfelt moments with amazingly detailed action sequences that were way ahead of their time. A great picture from arguably the cinema's finest single year of films. 5 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Western with a timeless appeal; one of the few essential Ford/Wayne collaborations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is not exactly a matured western, as it does show and (may or may not) endorse the conventional slaying of the battling natives by gunfire and such. But it shows how much a western can change in time, yet still have an appeal with its story elements, character, and especially with its style. An American classic nevertheless with director John Ford bringing his valley in Arizona which he would later use with star John Wayne in The Searchers and She wore a Yellow Ribbon, among others for himself as director, to the film of the tale of a group of people all stuck together on a stagecoach. After reading the short story from which the film is based on, some of the characters made sense, but they are still very much casted perfectly. New star John Wayne is in one these kinds of iconic performances that only got as good as with the Searchers. Plus there is Oscar winner Thomas Mitchell as a drunken, but not stupid, doctor. Very memorable as character study and as a pure action Western as well. As far as the style goes, the long-touted rumor that Orson Welles watched this film 40 times before directing Citizen Kane only makes the experience more enjoyable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great western thanks to the characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stagecoach sets out across the desert with a load of passengers, looking to catch up with a military unit and drop off the wife of the officer in charge. All the other passengers have their own reasons for getting to the destination, including a vengeful outlaw, a prostitute, a drunken doctor and a cad. However the journey is made incredibly hazardous by the fact that Geronimo is on the warpath in the area they must pass through.Although I miss seeing the desert landscape in full yellows and blues, this film is one of my favourite westerns and only suffers a little by being in black &amp; while and not really enjoying the visual sweep that later Ford westerns had. The plot is quite simple on one hand - a group battle Indians on their way to a town while some of the characters confront their own battles. However this succeeds because it is more than just a B-movie shoot'em up, it has characters and sub plot.The characters may be quite broad and the film may well use them like a disaster movie (set them up just enough to care about and then see who gets knocked down) but it does have touches that improve it. Characters are shunned due to their social status, `good' people are revealed to be not so good as they think themselves while `bad' people reveal themselves to have good hearts and the potential for redemption in their lives. While it isn't earth shattering it is well crafted and well written in the context of the traditional western.Wayne is good and this film allowed him to step up from B-movie westerns to the type of films that made his career. The rest of the cast are also good in their various roles, while the characters are broad they all play it well, especially Trevor, Devine, Mitchell and Carradine.Overall this is a solid western that has good action (include a great stunt that was lifted directly into Raiders of the Lost Ark) but also has characters and interactions which make for a polished and enjoyable movie.</fullReview>

Classical Hollywood Narrative in a Genre that refuses to die, the Western. Stagecoach is a movie which is begging to be remade as a sci-fi road movie, but has been poorly remade on so many occasions no studio would / should touch it. Its difficult to assess the movie in the twenty-first century - the pace seems laboured at time, the portrayal of natives seems crude, the climactic cavalry charge cliched. Perhaps because it created those cliches. Watch it, sure... but don't expect to come away with Citizen Kane under your belt. I'll eat my sandwich, and watch it another thirty-nine times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dallas and The Ringo Kid -- Awesome!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>`Stagecoach' isn't so much a traditional Western as it is a forefather to the modern disaster film (with Apache warriors being the `disaster'). In many ways, the film is closer in style to `The Towering Inferno' than to `True Grit', but it's undeniably a great film, one of John Wayne's best. It's a simple story, really -- eight strangers, each with their own secrets and emotional baggage, are passengers on an Arizona stagecoach going from the town of Tonto to the city of Lordsburg, despite the looming threat of imminent Apache attacks. Along the way, the stagecoach comes across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), who's just broken out of prison -- he's looking to go to Lordsburg as well, to avenge the death of his kid brother. He joins the passengers to Lordsburg, and during the journey, in one way or another, most of the passengers wind up learning something about themselves -- and wind up fighting Indians as well.Hokey? Not really -- the story's quite good, and for the most part, the acting's wonderful. John Wayne's great as the Ringo Kid -- this actually may be one of his best Western roles. The Ringo Kid is a murderer, looking to avenge his family, but he's also a fairly principled man. The role's a lot deeper and more complex than some of Wayne's later `white hat' heroes who were always perfectly good and flawless. The Ringo Kid wants a normal life, but at the same time knows he'll probably never have one, and John Wayne pulls off this internal conflict flawlessly. Wayne also has great chemistry with the wonderful Claire Trevor, who plays Dallas, the former lady-of-the-evening -- she's also seeking to create a new life, and the uncomfortable, almost shy way she reacts to Wayne's gentle, genuinely polite comments is terrific to watch. Like the Ringo Kid -- indeed, like most of the characters in `Stagecoach' -- Dallas wants to change her life around, but doubts that she can. The other characters in `Stagecoach' are excellent as well, but it's Claire Trevor and John Wayne who really make the film enjoyable. (Side note -- while he's quite good, I was shocked to read that John Mitchell actually won an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for his portrayal of Dr. Josiah Boone in this film. His character's essentially a cross between W.C. Fields and Yoda, and while I'm not sure who else was in contention for the Best Supporting Actor award with Mr. Mitchell, I find it hard to believe that this was, in fact, the best supporting performance captured on film in the year 1939.)John Ford's direction is excellent as well. `Stagecoach' is the first film where Mr. Ford used the breathtaking landscapes of Monument Valley, and even in black-and-white, they're still used to vivid effect. His action shots of an Apache attack and war raid are also stunning, even by today's standards. Ford also has great touch with changing moods in `Stagecoach' -- the film moves effortlessly from light comedy to tear-jerking drama, and the changes of mood never seem contrived. `Stagecoach' is clearly one of John Ford's better films. Does `Stagecoach' have problems? Yes, but most of them are more a by-product of the customs and conventions of filmmaking in the 1930s. For example, the music is often obtrusive, and doesn't always fit with what's actually happening in a given scene. There's also not a lot of time spent exploring the character's backgrounds -- it would've been nice to know lot more about where the characters had come from (particularly Dallas), if only to help understand each character's motivations. Since this can be said about most films made during this era, it' somewhat forgivable. However, one significant flaw of `Stagecoach' itself is the character of Hatfield (John Carradine) -- while Mr. Carradine does a good job with the part, the character constantly contradicts himself. He behaves one way in one scene, then in a completely different manner in the next, and there's never a reason given for this. Add to this that Hatfield adds next to nothing in the film (his only useful purpose, apparently, is to ask Mrs. Platt (Lucy Mallory) `Are you all right?' every thirty seconds), and he becomes totally superfluous. If the part of Hatfield had been excised entirely from the script, "Stagecoach" would have been much better. `Stagecoach' is not a typical Western (there's a lot more character introspection going on than blazing six-shooters), but it's an extremely entertaining film nonetheless. The memorable interaction between John Wayne and Claire Trevor alone makes it a near-classic. Grade: A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unavoidable.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For some reason, 1939 has been proclaimed "Hollywood's greatest year". I doubt that, but the year IS important if only because John Ford released his mythic *Stagecoach* in the midst of the surrounding Technicolor sap 'n' pap (*Gone With the Wind*, *Wizard of Oz*, etc.). In fact, *Stagecoach* firmly gets my vote for the best Western John Ford ever made. Unlike the current critics' darling, *The Searchers*, this movie doesn't depend solely on John Wayne to save it from self-parody and/or pretension. In 1939, Monument Valley wasn't a cliche, yet. (As it was by 1956, when *The Searchers* came out.) The whore-with-the-heart-of-gold, the Southern-gentleman-who-is-handy-with-a-gun, the overeducated-drunk-who-can-be-counted-on-in-a-pinch, and naturally the honorable-gunslinger weren't cinematic cliches yet, either. For that matter, John Wayne wasn't a cliche, yet. Therefore, if you can forget the 6 or 7 decades of baggage that trailed after this movie, baggage that has turned up not just in Westerns but in other genres such as film noir and romantic comedies and "disaster epics", then the freshness of *Stagecoach* becomes readily apparent.Oddly enough, the movie seems at first to be a cowboy spoof of *Grand Hotel* in the manner in which it throws together its 7 archetypal characters into the stagecoach for the long journey to Lordsburg. But soon enough Ford creates his own archetypes, like John Wayne emerging from the desert, alone, carrying his saddle like some epic hero. And there's the magnificent setting itself, empty and unforgiving and beautiful. Unfortunately, Ford would come to rely on Monument Valley to convey "significance", but here it seems at once incidental and yet integral to the plot. *Stagecoach* ultimately comes to feel like the birthing of our great mythos, both of our understanding of our nation's expansion and of the importance of our 20th-century entertainers. Even the characters' names have been burned into our consciousness (Ringo Kid, Stella Dallas, Doc Boone). And this is the movie that made John Wayne the indispensable American hero, a role he easily carried for 4 decades.Above and beyond all this, the movie also features one of the all-time great chases in cinema: the breakneck race across the salt-flats, with Wayne expertly wielding his shotgun, keeping Geronimo's hordes from getting too close. Watch for some death-defying stunt-work as Wayne's character leaps from harness-to-harness along the team-of-eight . . . then consider how cheaply it would be done today, with computer imaging and choppy editing. Ford delivered action the old-fashioned way: he made his stunt-players EARN it, keeping an unblinking camera on them the whole way. Superb. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>First adult Western with interesting character studio perfectly played by an excellent plethora of actors</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Classy Western dealing with a motley crew of roles in a cross-country coach beset by Indians and thieves . A voyage throughout Arizona with varied group of characters , a strange assortment of individuals formed by a prostitute (Claire Trevor, who received top-billing) , a coward swank (Donald Meek) , a crooked card-player (John Carradine) turned into protector to pregnant young wife (Louis Platt) , a philosopher alcoholic doctor (Thomas Mitchell , deservedly winner Oscar) , a swindler banker (Barton Churchill) , a sheriff (George Bancroft), a sympathetic coach driver (Andy Devine) and , of course , Ringo Kid (John Wayne , who arose his career languishing in Poverty Row) . The motley crew pull off a journey through Indian territory passing Apache Wells and towards Lordsburg . At the beginning they're protected by a military detachment commanded by a brave lieutenant (Tim Holt). Ringo Kid is an outlaw looking for to revenge the killing his father and brother by the Plummer brothers (Tom Tyler) . The stagecoach is besieged by Apaches and several dangers.....The first pairing of Ford and Wayne changed the course of the modern Western turning into adult Western , portraying in depth characters and brooding events with allegorical issues running beneath surface script . But the movie's little budget looked cash well spent when this classic picture earned more than two million dollars on first exhibitions . Based on the story 'Stage to Lordsburg' by Ernest Haycox and this one based on Guy de Mauspassant's novel . Outstanding cinematography capturing the nebulous skies by Bert Glennon and Ray Binger . Thrilling as well as sensitive soundtrack by Richard Hageman based on traditional music . Slick edition by Dorothy Spencer , a woman with a long career during fifty years . Stunning shooting by John Ford in the mythical Monumental Valley , a place that Ford was often to revisit and he befriended Indians tribes . The film won Academy Award for secondary actor , Thomas Mitchell , original musical score and was nominated to best movie for Walter Wanger and major studio , United Artists ; furthermore, for edition and Production Design . Very inferior remake in 1966 by Gordon Douglas with Alex Cord , Anne Margret , Red Buttons , Van Johnson , Mike Connors ; and a forgettable adaptation for TV in 1986 by Ted Post with Willie Nelson , Johnny Cash , Elizabeth Ashley , Mary Crosby , Tony Franciosa , John Schneider and Kris Kristopherson.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The start of all westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach, compared to any amount of western films would seem almost bland and stereotypical. All of the characters are exactly what you'd expect, a lead female without fault, a kind-hearted prostitute, a greedy banker, and John Wayne being John Wayne. It takes place in the wild west and there's a constant threat of attacking native Americans. There's guns and saloons. It's all very... generic. However, Stagecoach gets credit where credit is due, as it is THE western film to base all western films on and because it helped make John Wayne become a success. The story consists of three parts, a buildup, and action packed climax, and a wrap-up ending. Without going into plot details, the buildup focuses entirely on character development. At the time, this would be great, no one has seen these character tropes before. Now it almost seems excessive. I found myself bored for a good portion of the intro simply because the film establishes well defined character tropes for half the film. After making it through the character build-up phase the film picks up quite a bit and is over all quite enjoyable. Also John Wayne never said 'Pilgrim", which was a little disappointing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a child my father would watch John Wayne movies over and over and at that time being a little girl I wasn't interested in those types of movies so I never watched them. It wasn't until my boys were growing up and into cowboys and Indians that I saw my first John Wayne movie.John Ford is one of America's most important directors and pretty much made John Wayne a star. Stagecoach is a movie about a journey cross the West for a group of people with different agendas. None of these individuals have anything in common at first until the journey develops into a need of survival so they all come together over the course of their voyage.The use of the moving camera from the beginning of the film to the end gives you great visuals and details of the characters and the situations happening within the film.The use of the different characters changes throughout the film and we see that people are not as they seem on the outside. A prostitute with a heart of gold, a well respected woman is actually pregnant, a doctor is an alcoholic and a convict (Ringo Kid) is actually on a mission of revenge but at the same trying to keep everyone safe.The use of off camera sounds gives us a different visual of what is going on in the film. For example the ending scene of when you hear shooting you don't know exactly who gets shot until the survivor appears out of the dim lighting.A brilliantly directed movie of western outlaws and crime turns into a love story. I wish that I watched more John Wayne movies as a child.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If John Ford's Stagecoach is clichéd today, it is merely because it set the standard for `A' Westerns in 1939. That many of Stagecoach's attributes eventually became cliché simply speaks for the importance and the elegant simplicity of the film.I had intended to see Stagecoach for years. This, in fact, was one of the few times I actually read several IMDb reviews of the movie before seeing it. Ford's classic definitely met or surpassed all of my expectations. I came away with a strangely fulfilled feeling after watching it. Much of the plot, shooting style and other devises were so familiar to me (from later duplication if not outright plagiarism) that one corner of my brain occasionally complained `This is a tad corny.' Yet the bulk of my brain came away immensely satisfied-as if I had just enjoyed a favorite desert, alamode. My best explanation for this is that Ford's film simply WORKS. It worked in 1939 and it does in 2003. That, of course, is why so many other Westerns and other movies borrowed so heavily from it. It set a standard that held sway for more than a quarter of a century.What is so good about Stagecoach? Plenty. Ford combines just enough action with strong character development, solid dialogue and outstanding cinematography, to piece together a very satisfying 96 minutes of entertainment. Those unable to comprehend that a film made in 1939 and set (by my best estimation) in 1880 is not going to be played out in 1999 politically-correct sensitivity, naturally cry long and hard-as they do with nearly all pre-1990 films. Other than `Get a life,' I have no real comment to direct at this group. To those others, who fail to see anything above the ordinary here, I suggest an additional viewing. It may not be Hollywood's best film of the 1930s-or even the legendary year of 1939 for that matter, but it is a true Hollywood classic.SPOILERS AHEADSet in the Arizona Territory, probably in 1880, (The Longstar newspaper editor noted that the Republican National Convention was in Chicago at that time, making it 1868, 1880, 1884 or 1888. Considering the apparent age of the Civil War veterans and Geronimo's activities, 1880 would be my best guess.) the film has a simple, linear plot. A private stagecoach tries to make it from Tonto to Lordsburg, despite the ominous threat of the legendary Geronimo going on the warpath. Soldiers are promised as an escort, but are later reassigned, when more pressing dangers arise. The stage forges ahead, unprotected, and eventually faces the Indian attack everyone has feared. Inside the coach, nine individuals are gelling into a somewhat cohesive mini-community. As some posters have noted, Ford was good at building characters that were deeply developed, yet still managed to represent an entire class or group of people.The ensemble cast is outstanding, with John Wayne bursting on the scene with a strong and likeable performance as the Ringo Kid. Claire Trevor, Oscar-winning Thomas Mitchell, David Caradine, George Meek, Burton Churchill and Louis Platt, along with Andy Devine and George Bancroft are believable and for the most part likeable.Without rehashing every aspect of the plot, I will comment on the Caradine character, which has bothered and/or stumped some viewers. Hatfield, at first called `a notorious gambler' and `certainly no gentleman,' certainly perceives himself to be an old style southern gentleman. He seems to prove that he really is-at least when he is in the inspiring presence of a real southern belle like Lucy Mallory (Platt). Of course Hatfield turns out not to be the lecherous wolf we assume he is. Rather, he is a loyal ex-Confederate solider who fought under Mrs. Mallory's father. Apparently recognizing the now-grown Lucy, he decides she needs protection on the voyage. I personally do not find this sudden show of loyalty/chivalry out of character-despite Hatfield's recent activities.The most fascinating and riveting scene for me-and one I have seen no other reviewer accurately pontificate upon-is the climactic moment in the Indian fight when the ammunition supply has been exhausted. We have sensed that the `good guys' have a slight chance of surviving, thanks to the good shooting of Wayne, Caradine, Bancroft and even Mitchell. Now, however, the ammo is gone and only a fraction of the attackers have been dealt with. Hatfield finds one lone bullet in his chamber. Apparently envisioning likely rape and torture for Mrs. Mallory-as well as her possibly being forced to witness her baby's murder, he faces a titanic moral dilemma and then puts his gun to the head of the praying woman. Before he can perform this apparent `mercy killing,' though, an Indian bullet hits HIM. Moments later, Mrs. Mallory closes her prayer and seems to be deliriously imagining a bugle call. Of course it isn't her imagination and the first of the ever-present just-in-the-nick-of-time U.S. Cavalry charges of Western fare quickly saves the day.Other than Hatfield apparently dying, everything is wrapped up smoothly and happily. (One hopes SOMEone takes poor Mr. Peacock up on his invitations to visit his wife and himself in Kansas City, KS. Since no one can seem to remember his name correctly, however, this seems unlikely!) Of course Ringo and Dallas ride off into the panoramic Ford sunset, `safe from the blessings of civilization' and wise enough not to let social stigmas hinder their love for each other. For Ford, Wayne and the modern Western, of course, the end was really the beginning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The famous John Wayne got his first major break starring as Ringo Kid in the 1939 classic "Stagecoach". Personally, I'm usually not a big fan of the old westerns but this one definitely interested me. The presence of a mysterious villain, Geronimo lingers along a feeling of suspense throughout the movie. The audience feels like he could appear at any moment and that is exciting, As the characters in the movie ride on the stagecoach throughout the movie, we get to know each character better and each is more unique than the next. With the presence of many western elements, this film also contains a love story between Ringo Kid and Dallas. Ringo promises her a simple life and vows to keep this promise as the movie goes on. Many consider this film to be significant solely due to the emergence of John Wayne as the focal point of western films. However, this film is significant due to the plot, action, suspense, and love. Any western lovers would surely enjoy this movie,</fullReview>

It's simply John Ford's greatest film.The highlight of the film, for me, has always been the during the Indian attack when veteran stunt man Yakima Canutt first doubles an Indian mounting the stagecoach team of horses, being shot off and falling under the coach and its horses. Later in the same sequence, he doubles John Wayne jumping onto the team and working his way up to the lead team and bringing the coach under control as the cavalry rides to the rescue.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Walking into this film you don't think much of it. It appears to be another early western film with bad acting and terrible stunts. However, this film will gladly prove you wrong! Stagecoach delivers the classic essence of western films that we all know very well. The form this film takes brings us into the middle of the old west and soon before you know it-BAM! You have these characters thrown together all for separate reasons but for all the right reasons. The cinematography is one of the most outstanding parts of this film and really helps you capture the feelings and emotions sought out by the director and creators. The acting is actually very precise and outstanding. Keep in mind I have not seen many movies like this one but i know excellent acting when I'm on the edge of my seat fearing whos going to shoot first. Without giving away any spoilers there is plenty of action in this film, action that seems to pile up more and more until the ending. While the film is rather slow to progress at the opening, the middle half makes up for it with enough attention to detail and character dynamics to keep the audience running through this film. Stagecoach will let you ride shotgun across the old west and experience true movie magic in this 1930s film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns are my least favorite movie genre. I don't hate them, but I don't like them either. However, I have to say that I did enjoy Stagecoach, much to my surprise. The story was entertaining, flowed well, and had interesting characters as well as some moral subtleties? rather than all shooting/chase scenes all the time (and when it did happen it was well done). The main reason it stood out to me though was the camera work. There were some really lovely shots, and the composition was just great. John Ford utilizes the frame and angling of the camera very well. I specifically enjoyed a few of the early shots of Hatfield: his face through the window, and over the shoulder of another man while they're playing cards. Also the camera movement during the stagecoach chase. I love that these things were taking into consideration, especially for a western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Citizen Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I will spare you the details of how universally influential STAGECOACH was. It set the framework for 70% of westerns made after 1939 and, most importantly, became the artistic model for Orson Welles first little production, CITIZEN KANE. More on KANE later, but for now lets look at Bert Glennon's cinematography. This is the man who would later work on numerous Ford productions in addition to such projects as THE RED HOUSE, SHADOW OF A WOMAN, and RUTHLESS -- all in the Noir tradition. This suggests an intriguing interplay between John Ford's westerns and the Noir style. Fritz Lang was already developing the Noir narrative during the late 30's, but, surprisingly and inarguably, Ford was forging the early stages of Noir design. It couldn't be more evident in STAGECOACH. Powerful single lighting sources, long black shadows, and high contrasts. The whites are real white. The blacks are real black. Orson Welles said that he learned how to make KANE by watching STAGECOACH over and over and over again. What's this about KANE creating the ceilinged set? It's all over the place in STAGECOACH. Where did he get the sound idea for the opening tracking shot of TOUCH OF EVIL? Watch STAGECOACH. I don't think Welles would deny this and I don't think he would have rather lost the Oscar to anyone but Ford that night in 1942. Indeed, STAGECOACH is all over KANE. Everywhere you look. Ford's style is at its most pure and unadulterated here. It is done with his usual degree of technical virtuosity. The graceful camera motions are subtle beyond all others but possibly Murnau. Ford left so little to the editor in terms of choices, thereby exerting extraordinary artistic control over the picture. By giving so much artistic power to the natural surroundings, Ford allows Monument Valley to ornament his shots and they are thus illuminated by this dwarfing presence. The expanse of the west rightly plays a starring role in STAGECOACH. It's a Western's Western where outcasts can be redeemed by the expanse of the unexplored. The lawless and unruly land encourages entrepreneurship and thrift. Here, the west is the land of misfit cowboys, ready to take their chance and wake up from that American Dream. Of course, I can't finish this review without giving credit to the ensemble of decent actors who turn a stagecoach into a courtroom of extraordinary personalities. Wayne isn't strangled by his own image yet and his exuberance is tangible. Ford directed him with one side of the whip and Hawks with the other. Both directors drew some of this century's greatest moments out of Wayne. Unlike Hawks, who had a trove of his own gifts, Ford could pull more feeling and direction out of a human eye than anyone else. It's so evident in STAGECOACH.STAGECOACH, aside from being the mammoth standardizing western that it is, possesses a style that crosses boundaries and prepares the way for Orson Welles and Film Noir. If it isn't the best from Ford, it's at least a testament to his formidable output.96.8001</fullReview>

However, the movie wasn't as painful to endure as producers thought it would be. The locations were gorgeous, the main roles all seemed to contribute one thing or another to each other, and the structure of the plot allows for a great collaboration between characters. Noted, John Wayne can get pretty laughable on screen, and it's often fairly easy to pick him off from the other characters in the story. I think my favorite thing about this movie is in how many different emotions it can fit together in nearly two hours. We end up feeling instances of joy, sadness, and remorse. We end up laughing, gasping, and thoroughly refreshed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I image most of the reviews for this film are going to be constructive and say nice things. This one is not. I'll start by saying I'm not a fan of westerns in any capacity, so if you are a fan disregard what I have to say. It's not because the movie is old, there are many even older than Stagecoach that are better. This film was just too dry. I'd estimate the entire first half of the movie is almost exclusively dialogue with very little happening. 6 (?) strangers, few of whom are endearing to the viewer (I'm looking at you, Lucy Mallory), embark on a stagecoach journey to a near-by town but get derailed along the way. With much of the movie being strictly dialogue I found myself unable to become interested in what was going on. You may say I'm just a naive youth who doesn't appreciate the genius behind this particular film and don't respect the original's, and we as audiences have been spoiled cinematically with flashy, over the top films of recent making it hard for us to enjoy simple old goodness like stagecoach. That isn't true, I just cannot force myself to sit and watch 6 people talk without interest. Many of the characters were flat, predictable people (I'm looking at you, Andy Devine, or Buck) and the comic relief felt so incredible forced and dry. There are redeeming qualities, however, as Doc Boone surprises us all with a very nice and insightful piece of food for thought toward the end of the film. Overall, this movie does not work without John Wayne, he is the only one who was able to keep me remotely interested, as he draws energy and life into his part. THE MOVIE DOES NOT WORK WITHOUT JOHN WAYNE. Sorry for yelling, I just wanted to make that clear. If you can tolerate 6 people talking for an hour before things start to happen, giddy'up. Not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was one of the more less interesting films I have seen in my opinion. It is classified as a "western movie," but does not have as many chase scenes or fight scenes in it to make it more intense and fascinating. Although many western movies have the clichés and the stereotypes, that is how we notice them. For instance, the Indian race/tribe who fights and chases the "western" men. Yes in this movie it had a small chase scene that actually made the movie good to watch, but it still did not meet my standards because it was very slow pace. The slow pace of this film made the movie seem to drag on and on and seemed like it never ended. But, my favorite aspect about the movie was that of the higher class woman ( Lucy Mallory ) learned to accept and appreciate the help that was being given to her by the prostitute Dallas. It sends the message that even though there are many differences between people and their social class, it doesn't mean that they aren't people and have feelings to. So by Lucy appreciating what Dallas was doing for her, it allowed their differences to be put aside and their appreciation to shine.</fullReview>

We don't get to know the characters until later in the film because they talk and fight because of close quarters. Most of the time there wasn't much to hold my interest. The fight with the Native Americans was done very well and was the one part that held my interest except for the fact that after some Native Americans were shot more kept appearing. The end night scenes were done well and could see a lot for the amount of light they probably used. But I would recommend the movie to anyone who hasn't seen it and loves old westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My First Western Experience...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was my first venture in the world of the western, and I have to admit that despite some serious doubts, I found the film to be enjoyable. Granted, there were some parts where the film lagged a bit, and for a runtime a little over an hour and a half, it seemed to stretch longer. That aside, there were several aspects of this film that were exceedingly well done. first and foremost among those would have to be the outstanding camera work and general cinematography of the film. The long sweeping shots of the open west, combined with the action sequences were both fun to watch. To me though the most memorable scene of the film is probably the same as every other persons, namely the first time the audience gets to see John Wayne. That shot was particularly well done, what with the shot first starting from far away, and then drawing into an extreme close-up. A second enjoyable aspect of the camera-work was the way in which the camera rotated around inside the actual stagecoach, allowing the viewer to connect at different moments with each of the different characters therein. There was no one point where I was able to simply forget that one of the character's was there, as they all played so well off each others respective personalities. The film's story, while far from unique in and of itself, proved to be unique in the sense that as a viewer I was able to truly grasp the range of emotions that the characters were feeling due to their respective back stories. Be it the banker, or Doc Boone, or even the slightly less than memorable Peacock. Some things that I did not enjoy however, were times during the "indian" scene, where the "good guys" would almost never miss, and the Indians always did. While it is understood that the film was striving for perfect accuracy in its telling, a greater sense of realism would have been appreciated. In addition, the love story between Ringo and Dallas, while obviously needed to give the film its "Hollywood" ending, in my opinion, could have easily been left out. That being said, it is not as though I have no appreciation for a good love story in the middle of action, it is simply more to the point of avoiding such well-worn clichés. Nonetheless, despite these minor shortcomings, this film is a classic unto itself and it is clear to see how after starring in this film, John Wayne began his rise to super stardom. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone who is a fan of classic westerns, as it clearly set the mark for all the films in the same genre that followed it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A stagecoach with diverse people, a kind of microcosm of post-Civil War American society, makes a trip from Tonto, a typical Western town, to Lordsburg, a much darker version of a typical Western town. Along the way, the passengers pass through increasingly dangerous situations. Most change, at least temporarily. Some survive and some don't. It's taken from a short story that appeared in Collier's Magazine and is probably a rip off of de Maupassant's short story, "Boule de Suif," but with a happier ending.The character I enjoy most is the one who doesn't change in any way. That would be Berton Churchill as the banker Gatewood, whose wife runs the Law and Order League that's driving drunken Doc Boone (Mitchell) and the whore Dallas (Trevor) out of town. Churchill is a fat cartoon, his jowls wobbling, his voice quavering, always indignant and angry, spouting off anti-New Deal bumper-sticker slogans about how business is good for America, and we ought to have a businessman for president, and the government ought to keep its nose out of the affairs of the free market. He's running off with all the bank's assets.The year in which this appeared, 1939, was a banner year for Westerns. During the 30s they'd been cheap and crummy. But all at once we have a wave of "major motion pictures" starring names like Errol Flynn, Olivia de Havilland, Tyrone Power, and Henry Fonda. They amounted to a reexamination of traditional values that had become problematic during the Great Depression. What, exactly, does the word "progress" mean? The character of Gatewood aside, Ford doesn't address many of the contemporary difficulties directly. Poverty isn't brought up because the subject is the difference between social status and honor. His West is stripped of most of the conventions. There is no fast draw. Nobody cleans up a corrupt town. The movie is in black and white, it's Ford's first film in Monument Valley, and it has no bankable stars. It made an icon out of John Wayne -- perhaps in one single and sometimes out-of-focus shot -- who had spent most of the last decade in Gower Gulch cheapies with names like "'Neath Arizona Skies." It's a little too perfectly done. We can more or less tell from the start who is good, who is bad, and who is likely to reform. It's over-engineered like some German automobiles or Swiss watches. Yet there's a good deal of built-in ambiguity and qualification.For instance, Doc Boone is the happy but abject alcoholic. As Wayne's character tells him at one point, "That was my brother's arm you fixed, Doc. You did a good job even if you was drunk." Boone replies with a satisfied smile, "Thank you, son. Professional compliments are always appreciated." Later, Boone's skills as a physician are called for and he pukes himself sober and rises to the task. The expectation now is that Doc Boone, having "found himself" again, is off the booze for good. Not quite. At the end, when he and the sheriff send Wayne and Trevor away, the sheriff proposes they return to the saloon and have a drink. Boone hesitates, then says, "Just one!", in a tone of voice that tells us there is likely to be more than just one.The other characters have their stereotypical qualities similarly undercut. John Carradine is a gambler who has shot men in the back, yet he takes a pregnant aristocrat under his wing. "I'd like to offer this lady my protection." At the same time, he treats the whore with nothing but disregard.There isn't enough space to get into all of the virtues of this simple but fascinating look at American values. I'll mention the dark and dispiriting red light district of Lordsburg, which is Dallas's destination, and the insane laughter coming from some of the houses. The neighborhood is so drenched in shadow that there ought to be a neon sign somewhere, Abandon Hope All Ye Who Enter Here. In the final scene she avoids her fate by riding off with Wayne in search of a little ranch "across the border", a paradise that may exist only in the cognitive map they share.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Standard Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's "Stagecoach" is the definitive western film and it is only made more so with John Wayne acting in it. The movie is constantly entertaining and the action is often hectic but amusing. The cast of characters is what defines a western as most of them fit into the stereotypes one attributes to a western style film. The film is in every way about John Wayne's character and the feeling of the old west he defines. The movie touched upon some social concepts like the disrespect that follows women who engage in prostitution and the corruption of banking one could find. Characters generally get the ending they deserve and outcomes of struggles usually end in the favor of justice. The most impressive aspects of "Stagecoach" are likely the action sequences that are endlessly over the top and incredibly dynamic. Shootouts and the stagecoach chasing scene are handled with exceptional care and the film work for them is very impressive given the time of the movie's production. Essentially "Stagecoach" is one hundred percent western which is to be expected as it may have set the standards for practically every western film that followed it. The movie posses many aspects that define it as both a western and a film that defines it's era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning and some good laughs but the romance and crime drama fall short</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's Stagecoach(1939)does a great many things well. The photography of the beautiful and deadly wild west landscape, impressive action sequences, universally solid performances and very good use of light and shadows to set the tone and mood of the piece. Where the film failed for me was that I just didn't find any of the interlocking stories of the travelers very interesting. The romance between John Wayne's Ringo and Claire Trevor's Dallas seemed to come out of nowhere, as the characters had no previous contact it just seemed like the romance hadn't been earned in the time they shared on the screen. At one moment Ringo is inviting Dallas to sit next to him at dinner and at the next he's proposing marriage, it just didn't follow for me. The crime drama story seemed to be completely thrown away and needless with Berton Churchill's Gatewood being a thief that nobody really cares about. John Carradine's mysterious Hatfield is probably the most interesting of the dramatic characters as the dark and brooding gambler is not one to show his cards. The film's main thrust is John Wayne's revenge storyline and it certainly the most satisfying storyline of the piece but Wayne's characteristic lack of emotion hurts what could have been a more interesting and personal through-line. The film's brightest spots are two genuinely entertaining comedy double acts in the drunkard Doc and whiskey salesman Peacock as well as Buck the driver and Marshall Curly Wilcox. Both pairs have great comic dialogue and wonderful comedic performances and really bring a lightness and an easiness to an otherwise dark film. The other highlight of the picture was the climatic wagon chase scene near the end of the film, while it wasn't exactly believable(the Indians just kept coming)it was extremely impressive and entertaining. Stagecoach(1939) is certainly a mixed bag but there are a few very nice treats for those like me who just can't get into the whole John Wayne thing.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although this movie was not one of my favorites, I could definitely see and appreciate why it's considered to be a Western classic still to this day. John Ford utilizes breathtaking landscapes and views which even in black and white prove to have a vivid effect on all of its viewers. For example, his action shots of the Indian attack and war raid are truly impressive, even by today's standards. The scene where John Wayne's character leaps from harness to harness is a captivating and magnificent stunt - it was hard to take my eyes away from the screen! However, my unexplainable lack of interest in Western films may be the reason for my dislike of this movie. I thought the story line was simple, and the characters were intriguing enough to hold my attention. I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone who, like myself, has no desire to watch Westerns unless they wanted to see it for historical value.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going into this film I thought it was going to be just another boring western movie. Personally, I do not enjoy John Waynes acting and do not care much for the whole awe of Western movies. I think that Hollywood has overstreched its glory and has worn its magic completely out. Though, this movie isn't exactly like that. The cinematography is done extremely well, filmed on location in some scenes. The movie also takes a deeper look into the class clash. In the stagecoach is a variety of different characters, which makes the movie interesting. Watching the different ways that each characters acts towards one another is socially constructive. It highlights the flaw in humanity, and the inability to overlook such simplistic qualities that stand to separate people. I found the film extremely boring at times, just was not into it at all. I am confused to why John Wayne is revered as such a legend of the silver screen. He was revolutionary for his time, but I think his unique style and approach is boring and tasteless. I would recommend this film to those in search of good cinematography and to get a look into the social classes back in those days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The granddaddy of them all. A really enjoyable film- just wish they'd have colorized it. Lots of rich characters and excellent performances. First a tip of the bottle to Thomas Mitchell as Dr. Josiah Boone,displaying great wit and alcohol consumption. First movie display of a dubious remedy for a bad hangover. John Carradine both mysterious and noble. Buck the stagecoach driver played divinely by Andy Devine. I think this was the role that probably etched him as the talky, funny,perpetually married to an Indian/Mexican wife with lots of kids. The movie is somewhat reprised by The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance with Edmond O'Brien replacing Mitchell as the drunken professional with great morals.The movie is a showcase and a stagecoach for John Wayne. The icon mold is set here. Tall, handsome and laconic. Protective of woman while brave, Wayne does just fine while not saying a lot, yet he says enough to attract Claire Trevor and is good enough to earn the admiration of the Doc &amp; the Marshall. I've seen the remake. It can't stand up to this early classic. Every stagecoach flick with a cast of characters owes a fare to this trip. I'll bet Elmore Leonard's Hombre was remotely influenced. Nice job John Ford.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Wayne had 171 screen appearances starting in 1926. he got his first starring role four years later in The Big Trail, but it was nine years after that that he really came into the hearts of America as The Ringo Kid in Stagecoach.He burst onto the screen twirling a rifle and never left our hearts. He was such a friendly outlaw here that the sheriff reluctantly arrested him. His co-star, Claire Trevor, who had been nominated for an Oscar a year earlier for dead End, played a prostitute that was struck by his gentlemanly persona. Never had she been called a "lady," and she loved it.Ringo was the standard by which western heroes are measured. Yes, he wants to settle down and get that farm and marry a good woman, but there is business to finish first.Wayne will draw on the soulful speech and body language he displayed here in many films to follow. He knew that America liked that and he gave them what they liked.As we remember this great John Ford film that won an Oscar for Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), we fondly celebrate The Duke's 100th anniversary this month.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Among the most celebrated of all westerns; (some people think it remains unsurpassed). John Ford turned to the French writer Guy de Maupassant, (though effectively it's Ernest Haycox's story 'Stage to Lordsburg'), for this tale of sundry travellers trapped together on the eponymous stagecoach and fighting both the Indians and their own troubled psyches. Its reputation rests largely on being the first western to deal explicitly with 'serious' issues in an intelligent, uncompromising way without losing sight of the entertainment value inherent in good old Cowboy and Indian pictures, in establishing Monument Valley as a key Ford location and in giving us a new star in John Wayne, (his introduction on the road is legendary), even though the actor had been around for almost a decade. Personally I think Ford made a number of better westerns but this was really the beginning and it's still a classic.</fullReview>

They all have the same goal: make it to Lawrenseburg alive. It's a pilgrimage involving all walks of human life which reminds the literati of The Canterbury Tales. All have a unique past, and all have a different reason for wanting to get to their destination. Monument Valley may not be as impressive in black and white as it is in The Searchers, but there is no better scene in all of film as the one which ends with the sound of the cavalry bugle.

		<fullReview>...there's so much more to recommend this film than the Duke in an archetypal strong-silent role. Actually, as he plays an escaped killer, he's a little more interesting than when he's on the right side of the law. Practically every element here later became a cliche--the whore with the heart of gold, the drunken doctor, the small-minded small-town women--but they're fresh and unhackneyed in this setting. For me, the highlight is the Indian attack, and political correctness be damned: It's so thrillingly shot and edited that, while the outcome is never in doubt (this is 1939 Hollywood, after all), I really feared for the lives of the passengers. The photography is gorgeous, the dialogue lean and pithy (this screenwriter was known for this), the details authentic. All in all, it may be the best John Ford movie for folks who aren't particularly into John Ford, or Westerns.</fullReview>

They are temporarily joined by the US Calvary.

		<fullReview>Whenever I've heard people discuss this film, it's always been declaring it a western and not much else. A western it most certainly is, but I found it was much more than that. Stagecoach was a movie about a group of characters who had little in common, and through circumstances were forced together on a harrowing adventure. Much of the story takes place in the confines of the stagecoach itself, centered on conversation and how these characters relate. It tackles social norms, and even throws in an element of romance. Yes, there is an epic battle sequence that is intense and exciting, but what makes it so intense is you care about the characters experiencing it. Stagecoach serves as an example to all action films that would come after. This is how make your larger than life scenes matter to the viewer in a personal way.</fullReview>

Terrific as the doctor with a heart oozing in booze, Mitchell hit dramatic heights in this film.

		<shortDescription>"They're safe from the blessings of civilization"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is widely credited as the film that brought the western back in as a serious genre, after years of being relegated to b-picture status during the talkie era. For me, what really stands out about this picture is that it really takes the west seriously as a setting. What I mean is, whereas most westerns of the time simply trot out a load of genre conventions ? the cattle drive, the saloon brawl etc ? Stagecoach is first and foremost a gripping action adventure and a very mature humanist drama which uses the west as its backdrop. It announced to Hollywood that the west was a place in which stories could be told.Stagecoach also marked a turning point in the career of John Ford ? his first shoot in Monument Valley, his first time working with John Wayne and not to mention his first western since the silent era. It is perhaps the quintessential Ford film. It's a story about redemption, forgiveness and understanding for the outcasts and underdogs. It's about resolving the contradictions between old and new, and between civilization and wilderness. The west, and in particular Monument Valley itself is the ideal location for this story. Monument Valley is not only an incredibly beautiful and impressive landscape, it's also overwhelmingly empty and bare, with the rock formations as isolated as the outposts and ranches. For Ford the unclaimed outdoors was a place of uncomplicated freedom, but also dangerous and inhospitable. The growing civilization is also full of contradictions ? it is safe and secure, and the fairness of democracy was something Ford really cherished, but on the other hand it is tarnished by corruption and prejudice.What is really key to this work however is Ford's even-handed respect for his characters. The really amazing achievement here is to tell the stories of eight or nine individuals over a mere ninety-minutes. Each character has their own demons, their own reasons for travelling ? some are outcasts with nowhere to go, some are running away from something, others are desperate to get home. The journey in Stagecoach heals divisions, puts the fallen back on their feet and gives everyone what they deserve.Of course John Ford knew that cinema is really about entertainment, and he had the respect for his audience to give it to them. The action sequences in Stagecoach are truly exhilarating, and really unlike anything done before. You can even see echoes of Stagecoach in the action movie revival of the 1980s, particularly in the truck scene in Raiders of the Lost Ark, or the finale of Mad Max 2. I think one of the reasons cinema has always had this love-affair with the old west is, although it's quite a narrow genre in that it's confined to a particular time and place, it works so well as a backdrop for all kinds of relevant stories, allegories and so on. It's very often a safe retreat for a director who wants to get their ideas across untainted. Take for example the character of the Ringo Kid. Stagecoach was made at a time when there was a massive hoo-hah in Hollywood about gangster films turning criminals into heroes, and films like Angels with Dirty Faces came along to reverse that image, but with Ringo the outlaw is once again a likable rogue who deserves to escape the law.But, in spite of this being a very "wild" west, it's still a comparatively rosy picture Ford is painting, with all the innocence of 1930s cinema. The cavalry, for example are like a kind of perfect force, capable of anything and indisputably good. Stagecoach put the old west back on Hollywood's map, but the genre was to be massively shaken up over the next thirty years.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent! ...and it was only the beginning...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By 1939, John Ford was already a established director who had gone from making countless B-Movies of the Westen genre during the early decades of cinema, to direct very effective and successful A-Movies through the 30s. It was at this point in his career when, at the age of 45 years old, Ford returned to the genre of his earlier films with "Stagecoach", his first Western since his silent classic "3 Bad Men", and not only meant a revolution of his own style (that very same year he would also direct three other gems: "Drums Along the Mohawk", "Young Mr. Lincoln" and "The Grapes of Wrath"), it was also a turning point for the Western genre, as pretty much as he had done previously with "The Iron Horse" in 1924, Ford took the genre once again to the level of art, and proved once again that Westerns were more than silly shoot'em up stories of cowboys and Indians. With "Stagecoach" Ford not only introduced a new way to make Westerns, he also introduced the world to one of the most enduring icons of cinema: John Wayne."Stagecoach" is essentially the tale of a simple stagecoach trip across the dangerous lands where Geronimo and his Apache warriors are preparing for War against the U.S. Army. The travelers inside the stagecoach include a young woman (Louise Platt) hoping to reunite with his husband, who is a member of the Cavalry, a whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), a moody banker (Berton Churchill), and four persons of "bad reputation": a gambler (John Carradine), a drunk doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a prostitute (Claire Trevor) and the infamous outlaw Ringo (John Wayne). Together with the driver (Andy Devine) and the Marshall (George Bancroft) watching over the stagecoach (and Ringo), the odd group will find themselves not only worried about the apaches, but about each other's secrets as well.While virtually a mix of road movie and Western, what makes the plot of the movie (written by Dudley Nichols) really interesting is the way he plays with the characters and their relationships. Adapted from Ernest Haycox's story "Stage to Lordsburg", the film plays heavily with the theme of morality and hypocrisy, as inside the stagecoach are characters of every "social class", but everyone has some kind of secret. It has been stated that Haycox based his story in another interesting study of morality and hypocrisy, the story "Boule De Suif" by Guy De Maupassant, translating the story to a Western setting and toning down the story's heavy handed use of the themes. Of course, "Stagecoach" still retains many of the elements of the typical Western of its time, but yet, it shows that like Ford, writer Dudley Nichols was decided to make "Stagecoach" something more than another Western by adding a considerable amount of character driven drama.As written above, it is in this movie when finally the "Ford style for Westerns" is born, as he takes the genre to the level of art by his excellent use of cinematography (by Bert Glennon) to capture for the first time in his career, the amazing landscapes of Mountain Valley. However, this extraordinary use of wide shots is not the only remarkable feature of Ford's directing, together with Glennon he gives new and original uses for the camera with a great eye for the use of light and shadows. "Stagecoach" is a very atmospheric movie, as the story requires a great amount of tension between the characters and their environment and Glennon's expert cinematography plays a key role to achieve that effect. While books could be (and have been) written about Ford's visual style, it's worth to point out that specifically this film is very character driven, and Fords proves to be up to this challenge with great control and superb storytelling skill.After building a 10 years long career as a star of B-Movie westerns, John Wayne finally proved that he could be a real Hollywood star with his remarkable performance as Ringo Kid in this film. Granted, Wayne never had a big acting range, but this film shows what he could do when provided with a great script. Claire Trevor is simply awesome as Dallas, taking the classic "hooker with a heart of gold" archetype to perfection, making a very real and human character. John Carradine shows his talent in a role that, while not having many lines, says more with physical expression than with words. However, the real jewel of this movie is the truly outstanding performance done by Thomas Mitchell as the friendly, yet unreliable Doc Boone. It is truly the work of a master.One could say that "Stagecoach" is simply a film where everything is just the way it has to be for making a masterpiece; for starters Dudley Nichols' screenplay is certainly one of his best works, playing with his assortment of characters in very clever and original ways. It's true that "Stagecoach" owes a lot to Ford's directing style, but Nichols too deserves the credit for its freshness and overall success; I would even say that along with Ford, Nichols reinvented Epic Westerns with this movie. Finally, Ford's terrific use of music to enhance this atmosphere and Yakima Canutt's brilliant stunts (after all Ford knows how to make action sequences) complement this film and put it in a category few Westerns to that date had achieved.While of course by today standards this film is considerably dated, it still is one of the best Westerns ever made. True, it still has some of the characteristics of 30s Westerns, and I don't doubt that it won't be everyone's cup of tea, but it's hard to deny that this is no b-Movie, this is the birth of the Western as an A-List film, and the beginning of the legends of Wayne and Ford. Anyone remotely interested in the genre must give it a look. It'll be worthy. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"If there's anything I don't like, it's driving a stagecoach through Apache country."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne's first appearance on screen in "Stagecoach" is one of the great character introductions in film. It's as if he took the energy from all those Republic, Lone Star and Monogram Westerns and compacted them into one grand entrance that subliminally announced 'here's a brand new Hollywood star'. John Ford's trust in his actor friend forged a new chapter in American movie-making, and with it, the birth of the modern Western.I was surprised by the amount of humor in the story without a traditional comic relief character. For sure, you had Andy Devine in a characteristic role, but other individuals took their turn as well, notably Thomas Mitchell in his Oscar winning turn as Doc Boone, and Donald Meek as the subdued alcohol salesman. Can you picture him as the father of five kids in the story? The best concept though was the 'Ladies of the Law and Order League'; who came up with that one? For all the times he's mentioned by name, the one character who never winds up being a part of the action is the 'Apache butcher' Geronimo. Checking even the secondary uncredited cast, one can find no mention of an on screen appearance by the Chief.One of the impressive things about the story is the way virtually all of the stagecoach characters start out as caricatures, and wind up evolving into three dimensional people you wind up either caring about, or disliking enough to want to see them get what's coming to them. They wind up feeling the same way about each other too, perhaps the relationship between Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) and Dallas (Claire Trevor) to be the most transforming on a personal level.Hey, did the Plummer's ever have a chance once the Ringo Kid hit town? Luke draws an aces and eights hand and a black cat crosses the path of the brothers as they take to the streets of Lordsburg. Wisely, the saloon owner took down the mirror over the bar, or there might have been seven years bad luck on top of the shootout.If I had to come up with a single odds defying moment that didn't work for me, it would have to be the ballistics (is that the right word?) of the arrow that struck Peacock at the start of the Apache attack. It might have been possible if it had gone through the Doc's head first. On top of that, the booze salesman survived! In fact, everyone on the stage survived, putting to shame the law of averages in a situation like that.One thing remained certain for John Wayne, after dozens of Westerns, no matter what the situation, he winds up getting the girl. Unlike his many Lone Star films though, he actually had to work at it a bit, and vice versa for co-star Trevor. But at least it was neat the way Marshal Curly (George Bancroft) and the Doc gave Ringo and Dallas their send off, and it only cost the sheriff one drink!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Western tale of nine compelling coach passengers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not normally much if a Western aficionado but enjoyed this old classic, directed by John Ford and apparently the first serious one of its genre. The musical score is lively accompaniment to the coach's journey, and the scenery through which it travels is spectacular, even in black and white. It's very impressive to watch this stagecoach wending its way through the desert. I understand the picture was filmed in Monument Valley on the Arizona / Utah border. The movie portrays a dramatic stagecoach trip through dangerous Apache territory from a frontier Arizona town to Lordsburg, New Mexico. The nine very disparate travelers include an outlaw under arrest called Ringo the Kid, the Marshal escorting him to prison, a woman of ill repute named Dallas, an alcoholic doctor, an embezzling banker, a pregnant lady (Mrs. Lucy Mallory) en route to join her soldier husband, a mysterious Southern gambler, a timid liquor salesman, and the coach driver. From the outset of the trip, they realize that Geronimo is on the warpath. However, the calvary is unable to continue offering protective accompaniment throughout the trip. Not only that but if Ringo survives this journey, he still has a mission once he gets to Lordsburg to exact justice for his family's murder.The climax involves both an Apache raid and a classic street shoot out in keeping with the true spirit of Westerns. The Indian chase scene with the horses is masterful. However, this movie has much more than the standard good guys versus bad guys. It paints a character portrait of each of these nine travelers in a short time, and depicts very skillfully the conflict and other interactions that develop between them, the loves and the hates. During the trip a baby is born and as a result of the raid, there are injuries and perhaps even deaths (don't want any spoilers).A very young John Wayne is brilliant as always here in his role of Ringo, a cowboy who has broken out of jail. Claire Trevor plays the ostracized, kind hearted prostitute Dallas. A romance develops between these two social outcasts, although Ringo doesn't realize from the onset the nature of Dallas's work. It's a very moving scene when Dallas conveys to Ringo where she does work...the sorrow on her face and tears in her eyes would melt the coldest heart, as she feels her dream slipping away.The film tackles themes of social issues and prejudice. The respectable folk are not always as they appear to be. The banker is a thief, the doctor is a drunk (albeit a lovable one), and the Southern gentleman is an enigma. The outcasts, Ringo and Dallas, are good hearted folk with the potential for ordinary, decent lives. Initially the very proper ladies have run Dallas out of town. Likewise at the beginning, even some of her fellow coach passengers turn their noses up at her. Mrs. Mallory seems to undergo quite a change in her own attitude toward Dallas as a result of the unfolding events. Everything is so deliciously subtle in these films of old. For starters, perhaps I didn't scrutinize closely enough but I didn't even realize that Mrs. Mallory is pregnant until she's fainted and they're calling for hot water! Also, at no time is it ever directly stated that Dallas is a prostitute, the viewer simply gathers it as a result of the attitudes of others. No subtlety these days, everything must be blatant. This is a wonderful old film that appears to be quite simple, but has much more complexity than at first meets the eye.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Looking on the surface like a simple western tale of seven passengers trying to cross Apache territory in a stagecoach, this is actually an examination of the microcosm that is American society. Yet it's still a darn tootin' good prairie saga as well! Mitchell as a booze-soaked doctor and Trevor as a shamed saloon girl board the title vehicle under a certain amount of duress. They are joined by whiskey-peddler Meek, gambler Carradine, pregnant soldier's wife Platt and crooked banker Churchill. The addled driver Devine and marshall Bancroft are on top. Before long, prison escapee Wayne is picked up and added to the coach. As the stagecoach makes its rough and tumble way towards Lordsburg, the threat of Geronimo looms everywhere. The passengers all have reasons why they do or do not want to reach their destinations which creates the conflict and interest of the story and makes this a sort of sand and saddle "Grand Hotel". More thoughtful film fans will recognize that the passengers represent various elements of humanity and certain social groups. Director John Ford made this his first foray into the remarkable landscape of Monument Valley and achieves gorgeous results. He also does some wonderful things with lighting throughout the film. The actors are all exceedingly fine, most of them having acted in dozens upon dozens of films. Trevor is gorgeous and heartfelt. Wayne is given the star treatment even though at the time he wasn't quite one completely. This put him on the map. Even as young as he was, his forehead has washboard wrinkles in it, but his height and virility make him a striking hero of the west. Mitchell is nothing short of amazing. A man of many, many talents, he won an Oscar for his amusing, yet engrossing work here. Western veteran Tyler pops up at the end as a bad guy. Though the film is clearly dated in certain respects and has a few flaws (a heinous and unnecessary musical number and some misplaced levity in the dialogue), there is plenty to keep viewers occupied and a healthy dose of threat from the marauding Apaches. Unlike the inferior remake, this version keeps the stagecoach rolling during the first climax, which keeps the suspense rolling. Comparing the two films, the flat, TV-level actors (Mannix, Mrs. Hart, etc) of the remake can't hold a candle to the veterans in the original. Sixty-plus years later, this still has a lot to offer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superb short story of the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was a pleasure to watch a movie that told a simple story without ruining it. There were no over-the-top plot twists, and no loss of focus. Nine people are on a stage journey in the Old West. They are a corrupt banker, a drunken doctor, a timid Easterner, a Sheriff, an escaped prisoner, a notorious gambler, a Captain's wife, a 'woman of questionable morals', and of course, the driver. Their journey is complicated by the fact that Geronimo has 'jumped the reserve', and the US Army Cavalry is nowhere to be seen. As are all great Westerns, this is a story of character, or characters. A cross-section of society is examined under extreme stress, and justice finds everyone in the end. This movie reminded me many times of O. Henry's short stories, because it so often 'rang true'. The characters were all more believably human than those in most movies, certainly all of the recent ones. I'm now looking for this movie remastered on DVD, as the sound quality on the old rented VHS I watched it on left something to be desired.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>SPOILERS! BEWARE!It's no secret that "Stagecoach" has been a very influential film. What distinguishes it even more than that, however, is how simply GOOD it is. This is a must-see that is to be watched less out of artistic obligation and more 'cause it's damn good. It's the original Road Movie. You know the routine: A group of people (at least two are needed) undergoes a great journey from point A to point B and, on the way, everyone gets to be real good friends (well, in this case: almost everybody). The plot is as narrow as the path they take. You just heard it. Nevertheless, if the elements are just right (as they definitely are in "Stagecoach") these movies are a wonderful journey for the watcher as well."Stagecoach" is responsible for fostering or even inventing quite a few other trademarks too. The oft-used Stretcher scene near the end of your favorite movie. It's here. And so's the "redeemable prostitute". But this was back when it meant something, when wrong was wrong and forgiveness meant something. The relationship between Lucy and Dallas reminds me of the President's wife and the pilot's wife in "Independence Day". (Remember when the First Lady finds out that Jasmine is a stripper?) Only (like in Demi Moore's "version" of "The Scarlet Letter") no forgiveness was needed 'cause no wrong had been done. "Stagecoach" is "old-fashioned" enough to still think that selling your body to strangers was a sin. In this light, it's message of redemption is actually meaningful. Furthermore, its action sequences (really there's only one) are still wonderful. Watching those Apache warhorses pitch their riders after being shot can't help but make you gasp. And the Ringo Kid's intrepid stunt with the stagecoach horses is probably the best known of all this movies scenes. Finally, "Stagecoach" is filled (literally) with interesting characters. None of them are flat. All of the travelers get at least one chance to surprise us. John Wayne is still fresh and wide-eyed. His character, the Ringo Kid, is as guileless and doughty as they come. Nevertheless, even this early, he is a powerful presence on the screen. The Ringo Kid may have a heart of gold and seem even overly-naive but we aren't surprised when he walks away victorious from a shoot-out with three men."Stagecoach" is an exciting, endearing little journey that needs (for the uninitiated) to be taken as soon as possible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just as historical as the Old West itself!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the cinema's most historical films, this now septuagenarian masterpiece was responsible for making the Old West fashionable for the screen, not to mention kicking off the fabulous careers of legendary director John Ford and star John Wayne. All this, and its still as fresh as it was back in 1939! The simple story follows of a group of travellers who leave town behind on a stagecoach journey through Indian territory. The young, fresh-faced Wayne is excellent as the runaway Ringo Kidd who joins his townfolk and the rest of the cast is equally splendid and memorable in numerous, characterised and interesting roles. The screenplay is excting and light-hearted, though skilfully steps up the tension when it wants to. Ford also masterly balances the drama with compulsive action. You could go on writing for much longer about Stagecoach but it has to be said that this film is probably almost worthy of a place in American history as the Old West itself!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everything You Want in a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A classic with everything that you want in a Western, "Stagecoach" may be a little old-fashioned, but it's still one of the best movies of its kind. Besides a lot of action and suspense, there is a wide assortment of characters, brought to life by a good cast headed by John Wayne and Claire Trevor. The plot includes everything from outlaws on the run and Indian attacks to romance and a woman in need.After an introduction to the main characters, most of the action takes place on a crowded stagecoach ride through territory where Geronimo is on the attack. Each of the passengers has his or her own reasons for traveling - some good, some bad - and there are a lot of interactions among them, which may not be especially profound, but are certainly interesting. If some of the characters and events seem a little stereotyped by later standards, that is at least in part because films like this have so often been imitated. "Stagecoach" stands out from the average Western in that most of the characters have a particular purpose and a distinct personality, which make otherwise familiar events a little more meaningful. Some of them do irrational things, but that is what many of us would do in the kinds of situations depicted in the story.The scenery and settings are also good, helping the viewer to feel part of the old West and emphasizing the predicaments faced by the passengers. For example, one particularly good shot occurs when the cavalry unit that escorted the stagecoach for the first step of its journey has to go in a different direction - there is a slow shot of the path splitting in two, with the stage taking one fork and the cavalry the other.While some aspects of "Stagecoach" may be dated (such as the portrayal of Indians), this is still an excellent Western, and it is also worth watching for anyone who likes classic movies of any kind.</fullReview>

I mean, sometimes I see a film that everybody calls a classic, but I can't find what makes them like it so much. This however, is beyond stunning. Trust me, you'll have a hard time sitting through any cheap 'B' western after watching this. Just compare the two. 'B' westerns: very short, often running an hour or less, the really old ones have no soundtrack, and the plots were beyond stale. Now look at this film: Everything is top-notch. A great western classic, one of the best American films I have ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An amazingly timeless Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the breakout film that helped to propel John Wayne from a B-movie star to first-rate status. Up until 1939, he'd been relegated to series B-movies like the Three Mesquiteers or other rather generic hour-long movies. In this case, he heads an ensemble cast of dynamic supporting actors in one of the best Westerns of the era.Before I go any further, I should mention that I've seen this film several times but only this last time did I realize that this movie is actually a re-working of the old Chester Morris film, FIVE CAME BACK. In FIVE CAME BACK, the setting was a downed airliner in the jungle and in STAGECOACH the setting is a stage that is trying to avoid Apache Indians on the warpath in the old West. However, apart from this, the films are remarkably similar--with many of the same style characters--such as the "fallen woman" who in the end proves that she is "true blue", the embezzler, and all the rest of the characters are so similar that at times I mixed the movies up in my head.Both are superb films, but I have got to give the nod to STAGECOACH as the better of the two films due mostly to some amazing stunt and camera-work. The scene where they are being attacked by Indians on horseback is incredible--without the use of cheesy rear projection and top-notch stunts. In addition, the location shooting throughout made it a much prettier film, as FIVE CAME BACK had more the appearance of a stage production with lots of decorative plants--it wasn't bad, really, just not quite as realistic.Overall, I loved both films but insist you see STAGECOACH if you consider yourself to be a film lover. It is one of the top 5 or 10 Westerns made and is brimming with quality from start to the exciting finish.UPDATE: I had a chance to actually see this on the big screen last weekend. I enjoyed it immensely. However, I also saw another great Ford film that same weekend ("How Green Was My Valley") and realized that "Stagecoach" actually was more impressive when it came to cinematography. Inventive camera angles, the use of light and dark and impressive framing of the scenes give me an even greater appreciation for "Stagecoach" and because of that I am raising its score to 10. For a relatively low-budget western, it is awfully impressive and is without flaws.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Doc Boone and Lucy Mallory SPOILER</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The main characters in the film were complex and interesting people worthy of any viewer's emotion. These characters were so well developed that they portrayed life in the late 1800s excellently. The character of Doc Boone was an entertaining view into the life of an extreme drunk. Although, Doc Boone was a cheerful and witty drunk most of the time, he was also able to sober up and become serious when need be. The actions taken by Doc Boone were very humanistic symbolizing the good heart and values that this man does carry. It was Doc Boone's wonderful character who helped bring Lucy Mallory's child into the world.Lucy Mallory represents more of a solid character who does not take lightly to change. Lucy Mallory's upper class upbringing separates her from the other characters, but adds to the socioeconomic diversity of the group. It is interesting to see the social interaction between herself and others in the group, seeing that they are all from many different sides of the sociological spectrum.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Where what counts is what you are and not what you were.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When John Wayne shows interest in Claire Trevor, she tells him he does not know a lot of things about her. He answers that he knows all he needs to know. This dialog resumes the whole idea of the film. The people that are on the stagecoach to Lordsburg are entering a different world, where what counts is what you are and not what you were. It is the magic dream world of the west where everything is possible and you can start a new life. The trip to get there is full of dangers, because of Geronimo, the Indian warrior, to the point that the soldiers refuse to follow them as was determined at the beginning. Each one of them has his reasons to continue, in spite of the danger. Four of them are outcasts: an outlaw, a drunkard, a gambler and a prostitute. There are also a crook (the banker), a shy whiskey merchant and a pregnant lady. SPOILER AHEAD. Before the final showdown , when Luke Plummer sees that he has aces and eights (dead man's hand), John Ford is telling us before it happens that John Wayne is going to come out the winner in spite of being one against three. Why? Because the Ringo Kid (Wayne) stands for the myth, the legend of the west; how can Ford kill him? Stagecoach is one of the best westerns ever made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The perfect western from Guy De Maupassant</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In the 1880s the master of the French short story wrote a classic about the Franco Prussian War entitled "Boule De Suite" (translation: "Ball of Fat" - a reference to the nickname of the heroine). It dealt with a coach of middle class Frenchmen traveling together in 1870, who are captured by Germans (it is during the Franco - Prussian War). One of the passengers is a prostitute the others look down upon, although she is a nice person. The Prussian officer in charge takes an interest in the prostitute, and the others notice this. They overcome her patriotic scruples and she agrees to sleep with the Prussian. As a result the passengers are released. But once they return to their journey, they snub the poor young woman - she is still just a whore, even if she saved them all.The story was actually filmed in the 1940s (produced by Val Lewton and starring Simone Simone as the prostitute) as MADEMOISELLE FIFI. It is not considered one of Lewton's classic films (certainly not in the same breath as his three films with Boris Karloff). But in 1939 it was part of the basis of this film, one of the greatest Westerns and John Ford movies of all times: STAGECOACH.Claire Trevor is the prostitute taken from the De Maupassant story. But she is not given the same central ironic position that her French original had. Trevor does not have to sleep with the enemy to save lives, only to be spurned by them. That she is spurned by them is part of the plot, but her prostitute is far luckier than the original one. Trevor actually has a chance for real happiness in the end.Now set in 1884, STAGECOACH is set in the southwest, where a stagecoach is leaving a small dirt town with a mixed crowd of passengers (several of them are outcasts types - borrowing a little from Bret Harte's short story "The Outcasts Of Poker Flats". The passengers to the larger city of Loudsberg include the town trollop (Trevor), the town gambler and ex-Confederate (John Carridine), the town's drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), the wife of an Army Captain (Louisa Platt), a liquor salesman with a satchel of samples (Donald Meek), the town's Sheriff - going because of current dangers from the Apaches under Geronimo (George Bancroft), and the stagecoach driver (Andy Devine). Bancroft is going along because he knows the Apaches are on the warpath and have cut the telegraph lines to Loudsburg. Therefore he is surprised when the town banker (Berton Churchill - in his possibly most disagreeable character part) shows up on the town's outskirts with a single large carpet bag and the statement that he just got a telegram to head for Loudsburg for business. What's up there?It is a crowded little world inside the stagecoach, with Trevor being cold shouldered by Churchill, Platt, and Carridine (although the others treat her better). Carridine, proud of his Southern military heritage collides with Mitchell, a former Northern soldier. Mitchell keeps emptying out Meek's sample case (at one point Meek tries to stop him very gently - it doesn't work). Churchill keeps bloviating about Government interference with banks (to the annoyance of everyone else). Carridine shows most consideration of Platt, who is pregnant. This seems tied to knowing that at one time Carridine served under Platt's southern father (but under his real name - not his current one of "Hatfield"). Bancroft, when not thinking of the mystery of Churchill's appearance, is watching for the arrival of the cavalry to protect the stage, and the dangerous Apaches.Then he and Devine see a figure on the road - it is John Wayne in the cinematic moment when he stopped being an actor in grade B westerns. John Ford just shows his tall figure rising out of the earth as the stagecoach screeches to a halt. Bancroft now has another problem - and a personal opportunity. Wayne is "the Ringo Kid", a wanted prison escapee - he too wants to go to Loudsburg to kill Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler) and his two brothers, who murdered his own father and brother and stole their land. Bancroft, a peace officer, arrests him - but because of the situation Wayne is allowed to have free movement. Soon he and Trevor begin noticing each other - and becoming attracted.The film builds through a series of sequences that have classic, such as Mitchell's pulling himself together to deliver Platt's baby. The balance of the film is perfect, as is the casting. We end caring for these souls (except possibly Churchill). And it concludes with one of the best filmed showdowns in movies. Made eight years after CIMMERON won the first Best Film Oscar, STAGECOACH was deserving of the same award, but it came out in the best year for Hollywood movies in the Golden Age of the talkies (and GONE WITH THE WIND won instead). But it has maintained it's standard of greatness, and remains the yardstick for all Westerns that have been made since.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Stagecoach' is an effective western, John Ford's first with sound and one of the best he has made (in my opinion only 'The Searchers' is better). It tells about a couple of strangers on a stagecoach with the city of Lordsburg as its destination. It is a dangerous trips since Apache Indians are out there looking for war. On board we have Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), Dallas (Claire Trevor), the always drunken Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell), Hatfield (John Carradine), Peacock (Donald Meek), Gatewood (Berton Churchill), Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft), his prisoner The Ringo Kid (John Wayne) and Buck (Andy Devine) as the driver. All have their own secrets, making 'Stagecoach' interesting on a lot of levels.We understand that at some point the Apaches have to attack the stagecoach, but before all that happen there are other things that make this film interesting. The mysterious Hatfield, the romance between Dallas and The Ringo Kid, moments when the drunken Doc needs to be sober. A lot of the comedy comes from Peacock and stage driver Buck, who is not the smartest person on board. When the Apaches finally do come John Ford gives us one of the best chase sequences I have seen. Even for todays standards it is very good and as exciting as a scene like that can be.Director John Ford is always able to make a John Wayne-performance pretty good and in 'Stagecoach', their first collaboration, we have a Wayne on the top of his game. His character is more conflicted than we are used of him and he handles it pretty good. This is a classic western with some minor flaws, easily forgettable realizing the film is released in 1939.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The John Ford Stagecoach (1939) is a movie to be treasured, not analyzed. Its enormous virtues have more to do with the way it was made than what it is about, whether the characters are well-written, or how much sense certain scenes make. Stagecoach is not sensible, it is a movie; and it is the kind of movie than Americans do best and which no one else can touch.Ford was a great primtive artist, not a thinker. In Stagecoach we see him at his best. He blends action and emotion seamlessly; and has the one virtue that all great directors possess whatever their subject matter or level of sophistication: he knows exactly where to place the camera. This may seem like a minor virtue to literary-minded critics and viewers, but it is as much as anything what Ford is about. Stagecoach is, among other things, one perfectly photographed and acted scene after the other; with the camera, whether discreet or close at hand, always positioned for maximum effect, which in this film is as much musical as visual. Stagecoach is among Ford's most graceful films. It is also perhaps his least pedantic.The actors, whether sitting, standing, jumping, riding, talking, shooting, giving birth or dropping dead, are at all times where they ought to be on screen. How they go through their motions constitutes the bulk of the movie. We are not told how characters feel through dialogue; it is shown to us, vividly. The later scenes in Lordsburg are staged almost like a ballet; a ballet in the dark. Whether in a crowded saloon or an empty street we experience the movements of the principle characters, as well as the denizens of the town, often accompanied by music, some of it underscoring, some of it from an upright barroom piano, all of it relevant to the feeling of the story and the film. This is not a smart movie of the kind they make today. What irony there is is none too impressive; and the dialogue is not clever. It works at a different, almost subconscious level; and what one of its characters says about the young couple riding off to freedom in the end could be said of the entire movie, saved as it is, from the blessings of civilization.</fullReview>

Something I will say the film does well, is give some depth to characters, as goofy as they may be at times.

The idea of not using a set is so much better to me cause it takes the viewer there immediately. The audience doesn't have to be convinced that they are actually in the west because the movie is actually filmed there. Then the idea of all characters being confined in a small enough area to develop was great as an idea. The execution was poor in my opinion since the characters were boring. I feel as though I missed out on this genre of film since today it is almost corny. All the scenes and characters can be predicted before the movie even starts. This type of film was so popular it would be incredibly difficult to make one today that isn't predictable and unoriginal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach marked the beginning of a known career for John Wayne. Director John Ford had his eye on John Wayne since his stagehand and stunt man days. Believing there was further potential in the strapping 6'3" Wayne, Ford fought for him to be the main star of his picture, Stagecoach. John Ford certainly knew what he was doing, as John Wayne proved to have a prolific career in the western genre he would call home.Stagecoach brings together a mixed gang of individuals, each armed with their very unique intricacies forced to endure a long journey together. As their trip progresses, they learn about each other, and some even find love. The Ringo Kid (John Wayne) is introduced to the audience, with a superb zoom shot, as a towering figure believed to be a criminal by the other members of the group. Taken captive, Ringo joins the group comprised of an alcoholic doctor, a prostitute, a gambler, a wife searching for her military man husband, a "reverend", a corrupt banker, and an endearing stagecoach driver for the duration of the trip. Through the trip, a baby is born to the searching wife in the unit, we meet a native family with a visit capped off by a beautiful song, and we see an unlikely love blossom between the believed criminal Ringo and the prostitute, Dallas. The travels prove electrifying culminating in an intense shootout in which the audience is treated to a horse hoping John Wayne.Given the director John Ford's immense talent behind the camera, it is not surprising to see such a myriad of great shots in this film. As we meet the gambler, there is a great shot in which he is shown through the window. We see a wonderful overhead shot of the stagecoach fording a dangerous river. There are several other shots spread throughout the film, as enough good cannot be said for John Ford's exceptional camera work. Accompanying the superb camera work, was an exceptional score and sound effects. Realism was achieved with enough depth to make the audience feel as though they were riding atop one of the gang's horses. Also, in typical fashion for a film in the western genre, the ominous music played at just the right time to captivate the audience and keep us engaged throughout the journey.Stagecoach was a pleasing tale of involuntary comradery among very different people in circumstances which were not ideal. It was a joy to see the characters learn and interact amongst themselves as each story line progressed. It was enjoying to see John Wayne in a starring role, as I have not seen him in too much. I quickly learned why Wayne is regarded as such a giant to the genre. It would be difficult to not regard Wayne as a giant, considering his burly figure, but he also commands the screen with his presence in a fun way for an audience. I would recommend Stagecoach to any fans of Wayne's for sure, or anyone that enjoys a story told with a small cast in a confined area. This is a difficult type of film to pull off, but John Ford being John Ford accomplishes these difficulties in stunning fashion creating a visual treat for all those who take part in this picture.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is pretty much everything you would expect from a western film in the early 1940's, starring John Wayne. The best part of this film is the characters. Through out the film we follow a group of travelers who are looked down upon by much of society, including a drunk, outlaw, and prostitute. This makes for some interesting dialog and some funny moments. However, that is the only good part about this movie. The film is quite long and just as you think it is over, its not there was more. The cinematography at certain times is actually quite good. Some scenes stand out much more than others. The action and night time scenes for example. All in all if you are into westerns of this time period you will more than likely enjoy this film, or if you are interested in some great camera work.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Western that's crack full the worst stereotypes and racial negative views of Native Americans of the 1930s, like that scene were the coach is being chased by Native Americans. There is literally five to seven minute clips of nothing but Indians getting shot off their horses and trampled. Like for real. Any redeeming qualities they move had went to hell after that. The prostitute is being shunned and kicked out of town, and the supposed gentle man and lady treat her as if she is dirt at the bottom of their boots, why I bet you all the money in my wallet right now, the man has paid for a prostitute or two at one point in his life. I'm glad he dies. I used to like westerns, but this movie has killed off a bit of that like. Even the end was predictable. The only thing could about this movie is the gathering of strangers from different walks off life, and trapping them together. Novel idea. Shitty movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After watching this film all I can say is that this film is not even worth watching. For this being the first John Wayne film that I have ever seen I don't even want to see any of his other films. The characters in this film are so uninteresting and are just so boring. I feel as though the only reason that the film decided to have all of these characters was to get every sort of stereotype in the film. You have the drunk, the high class girl, the prostitute, a rich man, and so much more. The only thing I even remotely enjoyed about this film was the shootout with the caravan and the native Americans. Other then that there was nothing about the film that was even memorable. The plot of the film is predictable and leaves nothing for the audiences imagination. Just avoid this movie because there are better things you can do with your time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The sound effects in this movie were very good, the gun shots really rang through the speakers and made the fight scenes more intense. The ability to pick up who was a round or flat character was pretty distinct and showed a lot of evolution between the characters.There was also a social significance involving prostitution, and how most of the men were judging one of the women for being a former prostitute and didn't really look at her like an important human being. It also showed that sometimes in times of need, your unlikely allies will aid you and prior stereotypes go out the window. The acting was fairly good. The drunken doctor did an excellent job with continuing creating his character and the women he treated, and how she turned quiet and kind to an upsetting and judging woman. It had a lot of important scenes, but the plot could get confusing and the dialogue was really quiet and they never really explained anything that was going on.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>On the surface it seems to be a classic western film with the Native American threat ever present, and the American versus the hostile nature of the west. While this threat may always be there, it only actually has a very small part in the film, and mainly serves as a catalyst to forward the subplots of each of the individual characters in the stagecoach. This is the interesting part of this western, each character's own reasonings for the things they do, why they are on the stagecoach, who they are, and most importantly how they act towards each other character in the stagecoach and the relationships they form with one another. The movie does a great job of pointing out the social stigmas of the time and we actually find ourselves routing for and liking the most outcast characters on the coach.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Western movies for me (at least the old ones) have always reminded me of Star Wars. And I hate Star Wars. Cliché plots, cliché character archetypes, and always focusing on the good vs. bad storyline with very little variation. Bad guys always get caught, good always triumphs over evil. In short, old westerns seemed a tad bit too utopian, and I almost always knew exactly what would happen. This movie was no exception in that I knew exactly what would happen. The exception comes in with the characters. I knew good was going to triumph over evil, it always does in older movies. But what I didn't expect was what characters would be "good" and which would be "bad". We were introduced in the beginning of the movie to several character archetypes. The prostitute, the respected banker, the gambler, the refined lady, the drunk, and the outlaw (mainly). What was different about this movie from other westerns, was the way this movie explored both the good and bad aspects of all these characters, even though some archetypes (like the refined lady and the banker) were usually considered "good" characters, and archetypes like the prostitute and the outlaw were usually considered "bad" characters. The movie did a great job of showing how people aren't always the way they seem, and how every character has good and bad qualities to them,</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach has an apparent focus on camera work.It is shot almost like a silent movie, it has a lack of dialogue, to the point where most of the emotion of the characters is shown in their facial expressions.John Wayne (Ringo) is amazing in the film. His unlikely love story with Dallas is the most interesting plot line in the whole film. There is an implication that Dallas is an outcast from society due to sexual deviancy of some kind. Ringo is treated as though he cannot be trusted because he is a criminal. Both of them are neglected, even though they seem to be the most virtuous of any of the other passengers. The ironic twist at the end is that the high-class banker was the criminal all along. Ringo and Dallas are set free to go live together happily. The social message seems to be one cannot be judged on character based on whether or not they fit into society.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford, director of the 1939 film Stagecoach, was able to put together a movie that in turn was a real thinker. John Wayne, however is one that will bring people into the theaters for years to come. At the time, no he may not have been a "household name" but now-a-days he definitely is. This movie was able to get into people's heads and force them to think about "figurative and literal salvation." Of course the immediate focus to any movie goer would be the plot idea of travel and wilderness. However Ford was able to incorporate a high romance into the movie between Dallas and Ringo. Although there is not a piece of every genre in this movie it is definitely one that could get a lot of viewers due to its intricate plot. The different themes going on around in the script come together beautifully for a different type of movie for all kinds of viewers to appreciate.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To put it mildly, I wasn't the hugest fan of this movie the first time I watched it. It wasn't until I viewed it for class, forced to sit still and actually stay with the movie, that everything began to click for me. The boredom I felt upon first pass was now, oddly, acting as a benefit instead of an annoyance or distraction. Who knows, this might be the first big movie about boredom -- or not necessarily boredom, but the idea of being forced into a situation, and of taking a journey alongside strangers with which you wouldn't otherwise identify. John Wayne may have been the big "get," but I loved John Carradine and Thomas Mitchell most of all. Talk about two dudes meant for the silver screen. I'm not saying they share a ton in common, but by the journey's end, I was curiously reminded of The Breakfast Club. THINK ABOUT IT.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was a definitely a hallmark of its time, especially with its emphasis on major socioeconomic and cultural clashes. The list of strangers differ along with their personalities, which, undoubtedly are not cliché or stereotypical as usually regarded by common class and professional standards. Bearing ideologies such as childbirth, vengeance, prostitution, public notoriety, and alcoholism the film is far from bland with many of the films finesse lying beneath the phenomenal camera work with its powerful subliminal communiqué. Unfortunately, that's about the extent of its reach. To the common viewer who just watches to be entertained, the story is lackluster, along with some of the acting. Although quite a few viewings are mandatory to completely appreciate what the film has to offer, it is nonetheless an alright film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Western genre was always my least favorite films (most of the time I'm reminded of Clint Eastwood), but I never did sit down to watch one. Surprisingly enough, I enjoyed this film greatly, and it's thanks to the cast of characters. My favorite one had to be Dallas. She was driven out of town because she was a prostitute, and you know how everyone dislikes them. However, even being one, she had a heart full of gold. Mrs. Mallory, who didn't particularly like her, Dallas helped anyway when it came to delivering and taking care of her baby when she was unable to. Besides Dallas, we had Ringo the supposed "criminal" who ended up being a good man along, he was only seeking justice, the hilarious silly doctor who actually knew what he was doing (to an extent at least), and the corrupt banker. Stagecoach wasn't just a simple western film that was all about shooting and what not. It took the time to develop the relationships between the characters, and that's really important. It was pretty much my favorite thing out of the entire movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a great film for those viewers who may not necessarily enjoy watching Westerns. It's clear why John Wayne made such a career by doing Westerns, his presence and the overall ease at which he comes across to the viewer made watching this Western, bearable. All of the characters in the film make this movie a great watch, right down to the actors playing the Indians at the end,, during the chase. This film was never really slow, as I had anticipated, since it was a Western, and everything pieced together really, really well. If you're looking for a film with great character development, this is the one for you! As you watch this film, you find yourself really connecting with the characters, in a way that definitely adds to the ease of viewing of this western classic.Even though this is a Western, the director enjoys adding in your quintessential love story between the rugged, cowboy who is heading to back to jail, and the towns whore who is being shunned out of the town by the townspeople.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Well, I guess you can't break out of prison and into society in the same week."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach marks the first collaboration between director John Ford and actor John Wayne. The film tells the story of nine people embarking on a dangerous journey through Apache territory on, you guessed it, a stagecoach. The cramped interior of the stagecoach forces its passengers to interact and deal with each other in ways made unique by their situation. The film has some memorable characters and a thrilling climactic chase scene, but overall left me with a bitter impression of John Ford as a director.Stagecoach struck me as the sort of film that did too much in too little time. Thinking back to the events of the film feels like a hurricane of underdevelopment. The problem with having nine people on the stagecoach is that it never allowed most of them to become anything more than a totally flat character. In my opinion the banker, Peacock, the gentleman type gambler guy whose name I cannot even recall, Lucy Mallory, and Dallas all felt very one-dimensional. This is particularly troubling because Dallas is supposed to be the main love interest and her character didn't seem to extend anywhere beyond "the love interest." The other four characters were good. Doc Brown was alright but not what I would consider to be Oscar worthy, John Wayne was John Wayne, so either you're thrilled by his performances or don't care for him at all, but the thing about this film that surprised me most was the characters I thought were the best. The sheriff and the stagecoach driver really stood out. They were played so excellently that their actors took the sort of flat characters they were given and turned them into something worth watching. Were the performances of two secondary characters enough to carry the film for me? No, but they certainly put forth a gallant effort.I gave the film a 5 out of 10 not because I liked it enough to warrant a 5, but because I noticed and understood that there were parts of the film that were very well done. That being said, I hated it. It sickened me. Cowboys versus Indians type westerns disgust me to no end. The way the films so often portray their native American antagonists is absurd and bigoted, with Stagecoach being no exception. I do come from a place of bias, I was raised by a proud Native American mother, so I realize I'm taking more offense to this than the average viewer, but that doesn't change the fact that John Ford must have had an ignorant and hateful view of these people. The truth is "Geronimo" was a real man named Goyathlay, and he did lead revenge attacks after Mexican soldiers murdered his mother, wife, and three children. Geronimo was a name given to him by Mexican soldiers, so a good number of people at the time of this film's release would have recognized him as a real person, but John Ford just relies on the Native American tribal killer stereotype to make him a threatening villain in the film, no other substance is given to the antagonist.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I personally do not like western movies at all. I think they are way to cheesy and they are all about the same thing; a cowboy, sheriff, and Native Americans/Indians. And they always have someone who is drunk and is making a fool out of themselves. I personally think that this is annoying to watch. This particular movie portrayed a doctor as being the drunk. I think that this was terrible. One part of the film that I did enjoy was when the Indian jumped from his horse to the horses of the stagecoach. He was then shot by Ringo Kid and proceeded to fall on the ground was trampled over by both the rest of the horses and the stagecoach itself. Anddddddd he survived! This was pretty cool. Another part of the film that I did like was the very end when Ringo Kid shoots the Plummer brother. But, the nice part about this scene was that the Plummer brother proceeded to enter back into the Saloon, which makes the audience originally think that Ringo died, until Plummer falls dead to the floor. Overall, western movies aren't the best but, there was a few scenes that did make the movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>True Colors and Redemption</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Westerns are not typically renown for exhibiting depth, emotion, and evident truths about human nature. Unlike many of John Ford and John Wayne's other films this Western challenges that stereotype. The film has significance in what it illustrates regarding social attitudes, exposing the truths and who people really are, and celebrating redemption. Furthermore, this film differs from other westerns in the sense that the epic battle scene is not it's most memorable aspect. A key relationship in the film that ensues is the one between fugitive John Wayne and the marshal responsible for bringing him to justice and inevitable incarceration. After the lengthy, dangerous, and dramatic these men exhibit there true colors and the result is an iconic redemption for both of them. In the heat of a battle against native American attackers Wayne rises to the occasion and essentially saves the passengers from being killed. We see here that he is not a criminal but rather a well intentioned man willing to act for the good of those around him, his assistance in getting everyone to safety is his redemption. In turn, the marshall who appears a stringent law-abiding enforcer sees that Wayne is not a man who deserves to be in prison. In light of this new perception, the marshall lets Wayne go and begin a life with Dallas, the women he has fallen in love with. This exhibits the Marshall's true colors. Rather than the strict enforcer he is a man that appreciates good, thoughtful actions and is willing to reward them. The release of the Wayne is the Marshall's redemption. Stagecoach has significance regarding social attitudes because of the perception and treatment some of the characters display toward the former prostitute, Dallas. In a scene where all the characters are sitting down to dinner a few are disgraced with the idea of sharing a table with Dallas given her past. In the end however, they are forced to look past this when they must host the idea they all may be killed in the Indian attack. At the point the characters pasts become irrelevant to one another and they seem to embrace a sense of togetherness in what could be their last moments alive.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'll come right out and say it. Westerns are not my type of thing. I've just never had a big interest in them. However, I know that some of them can be very good, and I respect that. This one in particular wasn't bad. As the movie began, as with most movies, I already knew who I liked the most, and this time, it just happened to be a secondary character. Regardless, I much preferred the nicer characters to the not so nice characters, but that's just the way I am. The major battle scene closer to the end of the movie, even though I knew it was coming, was fairly surprising. It made me a bit nervous, considering the way it started with that single first arrow that seemed to come out of nowhere. I was mainly fearful of the baby that they had in the stagecoach with them (I found the baby utterly adorable from the second it first came on screen), because I knew that there was the possibility of it getting hurt or killed, and that would have been horrible. Overall, it was not my favorite movie I have ever seen, and not even my favorite movie that I saw in my movie class this semester, but it was pretty well done, and gave me a few laughs and a few thrills along the way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a very 30s film with the actors coming across as overtly goofy and comedic and the editing leaving a bit to be desired (though the action scenes are wonderful). There is some goofy stuff going on in nearly every frame, I guess this is how they made films back then - without the characters not contemplating much.However, STAGECOACH is still a very entertaining and cleverly plotted film. There are some hilarious moments thanks to THOMAS MITCHELL (I could totally identity with his hard drinking character :)) and BERTON CHURCHILL. CLAIRE TREVOR evokes sympathy and I could relate to the seemingly younger RINGO THE KID (John Wayne) falling for her. It is not clearly stated that she is a prostitute. But the fact that she is thrown out of town and the other passengers ignoring her at the dinner table and refusing to give her a drink of water in the coach indicates that she is a woman of easy virtue.The film does offer us some insight into the attitudes prevalent during that era. Especially through BERTON CHURCHILL's complaining about government interfering in the activities of businessmen and banks and the paranoid attitudes towards the Indians. It was interesting to see a very thin and fit JOHN WAYNE play an outlaw figure before he became a man of the system.There isn't much scope for tension between the characters as they are pitted against the enemy (the Indians) all the time. American masculinity is celebrated in an uninhabited manner (like when one of the men in the coach gets ready to shoot the woman whom he covets because he thinks they are losing the battle against the Indians).The hands on action scenes are excellent. So much more exciting than any of the over the top special effects crap being made these days. There are also some great outdoor shots of grand vistas.(8/10)</fullReview>

The political correctness of nowadays was not even on the horizon back then so the referrals to the First (they are as native as I am) Americans was not kind. The nine passengers are an interesting mix form an expectant, snob of an officers wife to a drunken doctor to a con on the way to prison. They get attacked on the way by some Apaches. I do get tired of almost always seeing the dumb "Injuns" just ride after the whites charging into their fire and losing many warriors. They were a lot smarter than that. Andy Devine is funny as the driver. After they make it through the attacks and the birthing of the baby they arrive in town. Here Wayne reveals he held back three shells for his rifle. They are for the three brothers he is after. They meet and Wayne does kill them all, no wild shots here! Wayne then goes to the hooker, played very well by Claire Trevor, and sends her to his ranch where he will join her after his prison term. A great movie!!!</fullReview>

When the Apaches come around the music really sets the mood and the editing between them and the stagecoach makes the whole scuffle really intense. Each character has such strong personalities its magical watching everything come together between all 9 strangers. The end of the film is epic and I was glad to see everything work out for Dallas and Ringo. After seeing this movie I can now understand where all the other westerns get their ideas from. Anyone who likes westerns must see this film simply because it is the king of its genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford's "Stagecoach" is an undeniably well-made film. Bert Glennon's cinematography beautifully captures the landscapes of the American west that most Americans at the time had most likely never seen. The camera also gives the illusion that the coach, inside which the character spend a decent amount of screen-time, is larger than it really is. Also, the hard lighting used during the film's interior shots and during the ending serves to build tension and draw the audience in. Despite its technical perfection, I found the film's screenplay to be weak, especially the dialogue. The scene in which the Ringo Kid asks Dallas to come live with him on his ranch, which I understand to be one of the most famous scenes in American film history, seemed to me to be forced and unnatural. The relationship between the two characters is not developed as much as it should have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though there were westerns before stagecoach it still is a classic. The main character played by John Wayne is witty and fearless. It Is a good mix between action, comedy, and drama.it includes the feared Geronimo in it which I found pretty cool. It the environment in the film was done very well. The acting from the whole cast is perfect for a classic western of cowboys and Indians. There is a god mix of drama and romance into the film as well, it is pretty well rounded. So i feel like it can be enjoyed by most people. It also does a good job of making the film seem real and give the viewer a suspension of truth. It rolled smoothly through transitions and the editing was good for the time period.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" is a B&amp;W Western from 1939. I'm a big Western fan but I didn't view this classic until last night (although, of course, I've seen clips here and there over the years). When it comes to really old movies like this I generally dislike the music and the B&amp;W photography, so the story and characters really have to work in order for me to enjoy the picture. Not to worry here as within 20-25 minutes I found myself involved in the story.THE PLOT: A number of characters travel on a stagecoach through an area where Geronimo and his clan are on the warpath. The people include a somewhat goofy driver and his shotgun, a marshal; inside are an outcast prostitute, an escaped prisoner named the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), a pregnant woman traveling to meet up with her husband, a suave Southern gambler who knew the lady's father during the Civil War, an alcoholic doctor, a crooked banker and a meek whiskey salesman.The first 2/3 of the film is mostly character development as the group travels on the stagecoach and spends the night here and there. The last third involves an action-packed Indian attack and the Ringo Kid settling scores. The attack is quite thrilling and there are a couple of outstanding stunts.Films like this are like going back in time to the period in which it was made. Although times have changed dramatically there's not a lot of difference in some ways. People are people whatever the time period and certain behaviors or lifestyles will never be respected by society at large no matter how "progressive" we become, like being a prostitute or drunkard. It's just the moral facts of life.The film works because it establishes the characters well and effectively builds suspense concerning the Natives. The outcasts all prove their worth one way or another because they all want redemption or to make things right. The doctor may be a drunk but no one else on the stage can do what he can; the saloon girl is repeatedly overlooked or disrespected until the Ringo Kid stands up for her honor, an outlaw, no less. The marshal must perform his duty, but how do you take an "outlaw" in when you've been through a life or death situation together and he was instrumental in their survival? Something else occurred to me while watching. People often think that the "antihero" originated in the mid-to-late 60s with the Spaghetti Western and the like, but we see the whole "good badman" concept here way back in 1939. Or consider Brando's character in "One-Eyed Jacks" from 1961. In other words, the antihero was nothing new in the late 60s.It's also great seeing John Wayne back when he was lean and mean, or pretty kind actually.The film runs 96 minutes and was shot in California, Colorado, Arizona and Monument Valley, Utah.FINAL SAY: Step back in time and enjoy a truly classic Western.GRADE: B+ or A-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Playing With Perspectives</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford helped popularize the serious western as a film genre and put its biggest and best film star on the map in this entertaining movie. It's not his greatest work, at least by my lights, but "Stagecoach" still plays well, especially at establishing Ford's clever use of perspectives.The Apaches are on the warpath in Arizona. While most whites know better and stay low, a group of disparate, desperate people travel on a lonesome stagecoach. Some are running from trouble, while at least one, the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), is running to it. But a final destination proves hard to reach, and Geronimo is making sure they never get there.John Ford was a great director, and "Stagecoach" shows he knew a lot about what made a film special. In some ways he is quite subtle, like in his launching of Wayne, who keeps our attention even though he seldom dominates after making his signature entrance. Wayne plays Ringo way too nice, with little of the grit he effortlessly displayed just three years later in "Flying Tigers," but his reaction shots here, a source of quiet lifelong pride for the Duke, are in fine form.Ford also gets rather broad, playing the comedy of a drunk doctor and a disapproving town or the ignominy of a crooked banker with hammy acting and cutesy musical cues. Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar as the doctor, and though fine in parts he is also another in a serious of problem alcoholics Ford played too much for laughs. There's a lot of talk and no action until the two-thirds mark, when we get a big chase battle between the stage and the Apaches that shows off brave stunts as well as cruel animal mistreatment all too typical of the period. Yakima Canutt has the stunt people talk about, but it looks too much like a stunt for me. (He's better with other, less showy stunts, and delivers the movie's first lines to boot.)Anyway, "Stagecoach" is often brilliant, never stupid, and not racist in the way some posters here complain. For me, the racism is more problematic in a scene where we see a woman abandon her husband so she can help her Apache brothers get some scalps, a scene rendered even more artificial by the fact she performs a song while rendering her betrayal.The reason directors still love this film is not, I'm convinced, for its take-it-or-leave-it storytelling but for the masterful way Ford delivers on the subjectivity of perspective. This is done both in the camera-work, lighting on individual faces exchanging significant looks in group shots, and in the script. At one point, the Ringo Kid is upset because he thinks he's being snubbed by some more respectable citizens, not for himself but the fine girl he's seated next to."Looks like I got the plague, don't it?" he huffs, starting to get up for a confrontation.The woman stops him, knowing it's her they are snubbing. Demurring on her behalf, Ringo sits back down, his admiration for her enlarged. Little does he know...The most memorable scene of the movie is during that big Indian chase. Just as the chase builds to a climax, Ford closes in on the face of a praying woman. Her face fills the frame, but our attention is more on the object slowly entering the left-side of the frame. It's a double portrait of hope and despair, but just as you figure Ford has no more trumps to play, he cleverly introduces via the soundtrack a music cue over the dramatic score that sounds like bugles. Is it just part of the score, Gabriel blowing his Horn, or something else? We don't know, and thus become part of this wonderful depiction of perspectives all askew - until Ford throws in what would become a cliché in later films but works like a charm here.Seeing isn't quite believing in this film, not for me. But as a calling card of things to come, from Ford and Wayne, "Stagecoach" makes an impression and works as solid entertainment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>When Rejection provides Direction ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not American, no ancestor of mine was a pioneer inhabited by the 'frontier' spirit, but I grew up watching American movies until they became standards of my global cinematic taste. But like many kids of my generation, it's only when I became a true movie lover that I started to consider watching the good old black-and-white Hollywood classics.However, I have one cultural privilege that increased my enjoyment of "Stagecoach": I grew up reading the "Lucky Luke" comic books. I've already made a tribute to the legendary cowboy created by the Belgian 'Morris' in the "Ballad of the Daltons" review, I mentioned that the comic-book was a celebration of all the Western myth, through humor and caricatures. Like many men of his generation, Morris grew up with the Western classics and each of his adventure-albums tackled one or two archetypes. And one of my favorite albums was "Stagecoach", and it really made John Ford' classic even more rewarding.Granted, there was no hooker with a gold of heart, there was an elegant gambler, in fact, all the gamblers had John Carradine's instantly recognizable features, there was a priest, the coachman was a caricature of Wallace Berry, there was a meek little man bullied by his dominant wife, and Lucky Luke was assigned to escort them. Yet "Stagecoach" doesn't feature stereotypes, it created them, hence its status as a landmark, not just on the Western genre but on the adventure movies consisting of reassembling different persons with different background and different motives in a same place, and the interactions combined with the action lead to close each main character's arc at the end. The notion of character's arc is one of the most basic principles in screen writing, in fact the reason to be of any film, because the purpose is to make us care for a character, let alone many characters. Maybe it's one of the reasons Orson Welles was said to have watched the film almost 40 times while making "Citizen Kane", beyond the masterful editing, the way the characters evolve all through a relatively short picture is exemplary. The film was unanimously praised, it's still regarded as one of the greatest Western classics, and was rightfully nominated in the AFI's Top 10 list, but one of the reasons it maintained its impact is because the film transcends the archetypes of the genre. "High Noon" was a psychological thriller, "The Wild Bunch" influenced the depiction of violence and "Stagecoach" is the milestone of arc-movies.And on that level, a gallery of unforgettable supporting characters carries the film: Thomas Mitchell steals the show as the lovable drunkard Doc Boone, John Carradine as the chivalrous and sophisticated Southern gambler is a living enigma and Andy Devine never gets over the top as both the coachman and the comic relief with the incomparable raspy voice. But naturally, "Stagecoach" is mostly remembered for the true pillars of the film, Clair Trevor as the prostitute Dallas, and John Wayne as the Ringo Kid. He's an outlaw determined to avenge his father and brother, she's a pariah whose past prevented her from all the privileges a lady should have, and it shows all through the film where she doesn't get the same treatment as the other lady, played by Louise Platt. Now, the more I'm getting familiar with John Ford, the less conservative I suspect him to be. I'm not sure his portrayal of the banker speaks in favor of capitalism. And Ford' indulgence toward the hooker and the outlaw reveals a very subtle vision: a man can find redemption anywhere, and maybe that's the core of the conquest of the West, a place built by people who escaped from a past to build the future, like Tom Joad in "The Grapes of Wrath", he killed a man, doesn't regret it, and only sees toward the future. Ford's movies are all about a movement, the idea of going forward, go west: the core of the frontier spirit, with the passing of time, across the nature, transcended by a magnificent geography. When Wayne proposes to marry Trevor, the night is the fitting symbol of a new day coming, a new life. There is some humanism in Ford' ideological view on the West, yet Ford doesn't compromise himself for humanistic considerations, notably through the infamous portrayal of the Natives. They are not the 'bad guys' but only those who try to block the road to the west, symbolized by the stagecoach and the iconic climactic sequence. Some would feel uncomfortable with the gut-wrenching moment when Carradine finds a dead woman in an uncompromising position (mirroring the taboo issue of rape in "The Searchers"). But the scene is not gratuitous; it explains his last act of gallantry when he saves one last bullet, to use on Louise Platt's character, while she's praying when everyone is running out of ammo, right before the providential arrival of the cavalry. There's no doubt that ideologically speaking, from Ford's point of view, Indians are the antagonists and although they elevated the film to its iconic status through one of the most emblematic sequences of American cinema, it hardly masks the controversial aspects. But the way I see it, John Ford was an ideological director because he made iconic films out of his own ideas, never gratuitously and never at the expenses of sheer entertainment. At the end, we don't cheer because the voyagers kill the Indians, but because they didn't die, it's a case of self-defense embodying all the survival instinct that guided the pioneers who conquered the West. We're glad the stagecoach arrived, but that doesn't make the characters any good 'morally', there is an outlaw, a greedy banker, a prostitute, a gambler, Ford selected a bunch of people who were own rejected in a way or another, they were not perfect, but at least their rejection gave their life a specific direction.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wayne before Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it may be difficult to evaluate aged movies on an unbiased scale, Stagecoach has certainly remained distinguished over the years. Sure, the film shows its age when being viewed more than seventy years after its release, but its cinematic value is unhindered. For one thing, the movie puts forth an array of characters who are both likable and unlikeable, but rounded regardless. Having only been familiar with John Wayne's later works (with which I was admittedly unimpressed), I was surprised not only to see him so young but delivering a performance I truly appreciated. It is impossible to discuss Stagecoach without mentioning the beauty of the cinematography. The camera-work, particularly in the more complex scenes such as the climactic battle, was really well done and made the movie easy to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This old western movie was quirky in its own way. I really enjoyed the stage coach with six horses, it was definitely interesting. The camera angles and the way it was shot was really cool too. I was really interested in the story line, although to some it was "hard to follow", overall I could easily follow it well. I really enjoyed watching the round characters show different colors and you begin to fall in love with them, like the doctor. He was my favorite character of the whole film. The acting, at times, was a little melodramatic but all in all? I really enjoyed watching it. When the new mother was praying in the stagecoach for the sound of the military trumpet, I was on the edge of my seat hoping for the sound to ring in her ears. To me? That is more impressive than most of the new movies with incredible graphics and if I say so myself, I'm beginning to fall in love with old films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's Make Some History, Colorada</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The expedition of Stagecoach, throughout which a contrasting cluster of amplified archetypes encounter immense peril, adheres to a more intimate formula of the ensemble disaster film. Claire Trevor plays saloon girl Dallas, ostracized by a citizens' committee of stuffy wives. Thomas Mitchell, with the physique of a giant baby, the countenance of a sopping chimp, but peculiarly dignified, is Doc Boone, an alcoholic surgeon, and nomadic John Carradine is Hatfield, a gentleman gambler. Joining these men are pregnant southern belle Lucy Mallory, though the time's cinematic decorum prohibited Louise Platt from revealing any of Lucy's external indicators. There's Sheriff Curley, played by George Bancroft, with his bizarre headdress of hair, en route to arrest fugitive jailbird Ringo, known to be going to Lordsburg to kill the men who killed his pa and brother. Andy Devine's plump coachman Buck Rickabough, his voice a fluctuating scratch, easygoing whiskey salesman Mr. Peacock played by the fittingly named Donald Meek, and there's Berton Churchill's corrupt banker Gatewood, a grudging incarnation of double standards and bigotry. Bankers were as hated in 1939 as now, by which I'm sure Ford wouldn't be surprised.Standard pigeonholes, but Ford and the cast make them inventive and warm by having them rebound off each other in startling ways. Character arc exalts Stagecoach. Practically everyone in the movie is either ripened or changed throughout the journey. Snobbish Lucy surpasses the biases of her background through her budding deference to Dallas, and even the faint-hearted Mr. Peacock reaps some might. A family man, he's better inclined to make a stande after Lucy's gives birth, albeit nobody care too much. Curley, meanwhile, because of his rapport with that gracious desperado the Ringo Kid, deserts his unyielding service to the law so a higher impartiality can be resolved.And Nichols's script was a star maker for Wayne, delaying Ringo's appearance till the other trekkers have been familiarized and the voyage started. The swift dolly-in close-up on Wayne indicates the conclusion of his B-movie limbo and the commencement of his fame.The conventional Western is inherently chauvinistic because the woman represent a way out without violence, but to assure the desire for action, this compromise must be discarded, making the woman's role a tedious obstacles to the star attraction. Yet Dallas does more than let the anti-violence spirit be provoked and rebuffed. All the characters can be distinguished by their thoughts about her. If Dallas seems a bit too defenseless, she still propels a convincing flavor of melancholy. The carriage becomes a tiny society, secluded in an immense breadth of antagonistic wasteland.Ford distorts the layout of Monument Valley, changing hills around like pawns and rooks to form a never-ending loop of sandstone background. Conversely, low ceilings put pressure on the characters, flooring echoes with deep clunks. It imposed naturalism on cinematographer Bert Glennon, who had to blazon light in from outside. But Glennon makes realism painterly, with the lustrous glimmering as Wayne lights his cheroot with a lamp, or the dawn burning through a distant entryway. One thing Orson Welles didn't absorb from Ford was the 180 degree rule, because Ford disdains it throughout the Apache assault, carriage and horses consecutively traversing in opposite directions. Yet because the arrangement of the pursuit is so straightforward, we're not deceived that they've changed course, and the hectic sequencing invigorates the tumult of it.The Apaches are an indistinctive danger, Geronimo a purposeless, one-dimensional agitator. As the m?lée climaxes, we suddenly switch rhythm for an insert where Carradine's character, with one bullet left, trains his pistol on a more unexpected target. What transpires is a striking moment. The spiritual implications correspond with the movie's storybook characteristics: The classic characters who cart with them the backstories of innumerable western tales, the fairy-tale backcloth suggesting a legendary myth. Ford's method is to construct a Wild West of the mind's eye, guided purely by the commandments of storytelling, and then go into it as a voyager, obliging its authenticity by filming compelling minutiae, a sociologist for an imaginary world.The story takes us from a town of haughty hypocrites to a noirish conflagration of prostitution and budding brutality. When our surviving characters make it there, the supporting figures urge dramatic exoduses and Ringo's payback shifts to spotlight, with his looming incarceration and his affection for Dallas as complicating dynamics. These are so skillfully steady that a happy ending feels unworkable, which is all part of Stagecoach's storytelling dexterity.The screenplay devises some distinctive, credible frontier outlooks: In the closing face-off, three versus one is deemed non-discriminatory, but if one of the three sports a rifle, that's cold-blooded. The showdown is only overheard, which evokes the dramatic reduction by which Ford swells to a poignant culmination. Ford affords the lurid diversions of the western the substance of myth, with concentrated psychology and social editorial lugged through human exchanges and fleeting looks. Stagecoach turns trendy amusement into cinematic balladry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the first Western I've seen, and for the most part, I enjoyed the film. I thought the movie was filled with good acting, especially in the performances by John Wayne, as the Ringo Kid, and Clare Trevor as Dallas. Their characters were interesting and likable. However, I thought the romance between them wasn't that interesting. Because they were both outcasts, they seemed to be drawn together by the situation rather than because they had genuine feelings for each other. What I thought was a more interesting relationship was the one between Dallas, a prostitute, and Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt), a young wife, who initially shuns Dallas, but gradually comes to respect her as a person.While some of the story seemed to drag, especially in the early stages of their journey, the suspense did begin to build once they discovered that they were being followed by the Apaches. One especially exciting part of the movie was the battle scene with the Apaches near the end. Both the stunts and the camera work were excellent and held my interest. Another enjoyable part of the film for me was some of the comedic parts from Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) and Buck (Andy Devine).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the epitome of the Western Genre. How could you possibly go wrong with John Wayne and John Ford? Answer, you can't. This film is shot on location and it gives the movie a very authentic feeling. I feel this was crucial to the success of the film, too many movies feel forced in their attempt to achieve believability and one advantage of shooting on location is that it gives us the most realistic look possible. On top of this it brings us the great John Wayne. AFI ranked him as the 13th greatest male star of all time and that's hard to argue especially after you've seen him in this film. He's exactly what a western needs; a rough, rugged, hard nosed no-nonsense cowboy. Orson Welles regarded it as the perfect textbook for filmmaking and he's widely considered as one of the greatest directors of all time so you be the judge.</fullReview>

Another great social commentary pointing out a common misconception that all fugitives are bad. The excellent story line combined with the extraordinary scenery of the west come together to make an all around good movie. I liked that as the viewer we get to see a lot of the characters background or find it out throughout the movie. I enjoyed the combination of both long range panoramic shots combined with the close ups, and the action follow camera during the Indian chase creates the feeling that the viewer is actually in the movie.

		<fullReview>What stood out to me in "Stagecoach" is the visually stunning landscape. It gave the film an authentic feel which was not achieved by the sub-par acting. The story is good, but also a simple one which takes a rag tag group of strangers with nothing in common, and puts them in danger. United by a common goal of survival, these stereotypical characters break away and reveal they aren't the people their stereotypes would lead you to believe. This motif may have been new at the time of the films release, but I didn't find it to be all that captivating. I expected more action from this film, but really didn't get it until the end of the movie.

		<shortDescription>An entertaining and intimate western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The narrative of Stagecoach is very simple. A group of contrasting individuals travel across the Arizona desert in a stagecoach. Their journey is from the prim 'Eastern' town of Tonto to the wild 'Western' town of Lordsburg, via the Apache infested desert. Although the story is basic, the characterizations have some depth and the interactions between the passengers provide most of the impetus of the film. The characters can roughly be divided into the Eastern four ? the banker, the salesman, the upper-class lady, the gambler ? and the frontier five ? the driver, the lawman, the doctor, the prostitute, the outlaw ? and much of the conflict in the film comes from the culture clash between these two groups. Clearly the sympathetic characters are the frontier folks. The group from 'civilisation' are portrayed as snobbish, superficial and dishonest, while the westerners are imperfect people ? the coward, the drunk, the whore, the outlaw - but all have noble characters. Stagecoach is as much about the impossibility of these two disparate groups living harmoniously together than it is about the hazardous trek across hostile terrain. The Apaches are presented so one-dimensionally that they have no character or motivation beyond being murderous savages. They are just another obstacle for our group to overcome. Although what a glorious obstacle they turn out to be ? the action scene involving the Indian attack is excellently orchestrated and exciting, with some terrifically dangerous looking stunt-work. Not quite the same can be made of the final scenes in Lordsburg between the hero and the three gunslinging villainous brothers; these final parts just seem somewhat underwhelming overall and means that the film doesn't end on a great climax.Stagecoach seems to have been a landmark Western. It ushered in a brief period where the genre was treated as a prestige category and it made a star of John Wayne. So its significance in cinematic history is cemented. It's quite an accessible film for those who aren't too keen on the genre as a whole, as it doesn't really focus on the Cowboys and Indians side of things that much, and mainly concentrates on its character interactions. An enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I enjoyed Stagecoach (1939). It was a little slow at first when all the characters were introduced, but then picked up the pace once they began their voyage and came across Ringo Kid (John Wayne). The action scenes were well done and fast paced. I think the chase scene was intense, I wasn't expecting Hatfield to try and kill Miss Mallory with his last bullet, and I was totally convinced he was going to carry out his attempt, I never saw it coming that the cavalry would arrive just in time. Also, the stunt one of the Indians pulls off when he goes underneath the horses and coach was impressive. I personally could have gone without so many diving horses during the chase scene. The lighting during, and shortly before the final shoot scene with Ringo and Plummer was great, especially the way Plummer is introduced at the card table sitting ominously in the shadows. Overall it was great and I would recommend it to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is directed by John Ford and adapted by Dudley Nichols from a story by Ernest Haycox. It stars Claire Trevor, John Wayne, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine, Donald Meek and Louise Platt. Director of photography is Bert Glennon and director of music Boris Morros.6 people on board a stagecoach bound for Lordsburg, each one very different in character, each one with their own issues in life, and some carrying shame as well as dark secrets. The journey is fraught with danger as the Apache are tracking them thru the desert flats, can all the polar opposites come together to form a united front?It's now written in history that the 1930s was a bad decade for the Western movie. The decade began with expensive flops The Big Trail &amp; Cimarron and from there the big studios pretty much condemned the genre to being nothing more than a B movie production line. Then in 1937 a story called Stage to Lordsburg was published in Collier's magazine, a story written by Ernest Haycox that itself was inspired by a short story called Boule de Suif written by Guy de Maupassant. John Ford liked the story very much and purchased the rights, trusting Dudley Nichols to rework a screenplay into a classic Western narrative. Meeting resistance from some of the head men at the studios, Ford had to fight hard to not only get the film made, but to also have John Wayne playing The Ringo Kid. Gary Cooper and Joel McCrea were wanted instead of Wayne, and Marlene Dietrich was suggested for the role of Dallas, the role eventually went to Claire Trevor. But Ford stuck to his guns, and rightly so, for now Stagecoach can be seen as a wonderful film that not only launched Wayne to stardom, but also as the film that reignited the Western genre and paved the way for some essential classics that followed.John Ford's first sound Western is rich with character dynamics at play, with the great director exploring what would become a trademark theme of his, that of moral qualities born out of people deemed less pure in society's eyes. True enough Stagecoach is still very traditional in an early Western movie sense, but the study of different characters under duress is magnificently moulded by director and cast alike. It was something that Orson Welles liked about the film, calling it perfect textbook film making, even claiming it to be a film he watched numerous times whilst crafting Citizen Kane. It's easy to believe Welles, we obviously remember the stunning Apache pursuit of the rocketing stagecoach, the stunt work, the breathless energy and the majestic location of Monument Valley, but thematically the film sizzles as well. That Ford is able to marry sharp action with real human drama-intimate drama played out on a massive panoramic landscape-is why Stagecoach continually entertains and influences with each passing year.From the moment Ford zooms up close on the face of John Wayne, a mega-star was born, but more importantly, from the opening credits to the last second of Stagecoach, the Western movie was reborn. A near masterpiece of the genre. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For all the John Wayne fans out there this is a great movie to watch! The younger Wayne's character is almost immediately "charming" and well liked. His character displays the personality traits that any good person should hand want to have. The personalities of all the characters are either scripted to be rounded or very forthright. Stagecoach offers a deeper look at women and the line between black and white becomes very gray. The virtues woman in the movie has her faults just like the saloon girl. The aspects of the saloon girl are further explored and John Ford (director) looks deeper into why she has the life that she does. She is treated poorly and shunned by the "good" people of the town and the stage coach. But John Wayne's character is the kind of man/person that looks beyond labels and at the people behind them. And the "rules" of society are broken by the small things like a married woman who is a little bit interested in the gambler; or the well to do banker who is a thief. The story line is written really well and depicted beautifully by John Ford. Every camera shot that was filmed was natural and done smoothly. From the close up shots to long-shots, actions shots and "quiet" shots, each was done with the intention to make it feel as real as possible. Even the lighting done to hide the faces or to cast a heavy foreshadow of what was to come.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>My First Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach was my first venture into the western genre, but I didn't enjoy the film as a whole. I found it to be slow at times. This was also my first John Wayne movie. In this particular movie, his acting was not the best and it is apparent in the scene where his character reveals that his brother was murdered.Aside from the few things I found disagreeable, the rest of the film was quite good. There is a solid dynamic between the characters that definitely draws the viewer in. John Ford makes excellent use of lighting throughout the film to set a tone with in particular scenes. Also, the stunt work in the Indian chase scene was fabulous. Knowing how dangerous the stunts were makes the scene even more memorable. Overall this film is definitely worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was my first John Wayne starred film and the earliest made western i have seen. i was not very impressed. i thought the majority of the movie was rather dull. the story in my opinion doesn't grab the audience in way that keeps them attentive, though I did perk up during the more action filled parts including the chase scene and on (maybe i am just too accustomed to the action filled modern films around today). there are some great characters and actors. I really enjoyed the doctors role, he was very round. I also enjoyed John Wayne, but i do think others stood out more. I will not rule out westerns altogether, i think i should see a few more before making a final judgment of this genre.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"True Grit" being my favorite John Wayne movie, if not the only one I had seen. So when I saw "Stagecoach" I was immediately shocked by how young John Wayne was. I had forgotten he had a successful Western career, playing pretty much the same character. This was a very good movie in terms of the message. The bad guy was the good guy and the good guy was the bad guy, one of the first movies to do that and makes the audience think and question their judgements of people in general. However, the acting itself was a tad mediocre. There was not much to John Wayne's character. Although he was the star of the movie, I felt as if the audience viewed him as more of a flat than a round character and I cannot determine whether that be the fault of the script or the acting itself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Old Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a pretty darn good movie! I have never actually given an old western or a John Wayne movie a chance until recently. I'm really glad I did, because I think I would watch it again, and I am very happy that I was finally exposed to the genre.I have heard many people say throughout my life that they do not think that John Wayne is a very good actor, and it always seems to be "John Wayne in another movie." I cannot relate to that comment because this is the first movie of his I have seen. I was not knocked out of my chair by his acting skills (like I have been by Robert de Niro or Marlon Brando), but I thought he was a pretty good actor. He has a very charming smile that almost makes your heart melt, and I can see why the man was so popular.The whole movie is very entertaining and it is interesting to watch all of the characters interact. It seems to turn out in the end that the virtuous woman is actually not so virtuous and the prostitute seems to be the one with more of a heart. I absolutely loved the war scene between the "cowboys and Indians." I have never actually watched a movie with this and I was very pleased to finally see one of those scenes. I definitely recommend watching, if you haven't already!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of my favourite westerns of all time, second only to "High Noon".</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" is one of the most influential Westerns ever made. It is based around a concept which has since become a classic Western plot- the motley group of strangers forced by chance to travel together through hostile territory. This plot was used, for example, in the Paul Newman film "Hombre" and has also been used in non-Westerns, such as the British-made "North-West Frontier", set in India, and "The Journey", about the 1956 Hungarian Revolution.In this instance the motley group is travelling by stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. The date is 1880, during the period of the Apache Wars. Among the travellers are a prostitute, an alcoholic doctor, a Southern gentleman-gambler named Hatfield, a pregnant woman travelling to meet her cavalry officer husband, a banker and a whiskey salesman. Along the way the stagecoach also acquires a reluctant passenger, an outlaw named the Ringo Kid, who has been taken into custody by a US Marshal."Stagecoach" is notable for two reasons. Firstly, it is the first sound Western directed by John Ford. Although Ford had made westerns, such as "The Iron Horse", during the silent film era, he had not made any since the coming of sound, and had spent the late twenties and thirties working in other genres. It was also the first film that Ford made in Monument Valley with its sandstone buttes which were to become something of a trademark in his films.Secondly, this was the film which made a major star of John Wayne, previously regarded as a B-movie star but only a supporting player in A-movies. Although Wayne has the largest role in the picture, that of the Ringo Kid, he took second billing behind Claire Trevor, regarded as a much bigger name in 1939. He was 32 at the time the film was made, but looks younger, surprisingly youthful for those like myself who chiefly remember him as the grizzled old hero he became in the sixties and seventies. Part of the myth which has grown up around Wayne is that he only played characters who were patriotic, courageous and 100% morally upright, but the truth is rather more complex; it is worth recalling that in the film that made him a star he plays an outlaw in search of redemption, not a flawless hero. (The same is also true of Wayne's last film, "The Shootist", from nearly forty years later).Some of the scenes in the film make use of what were later to become standard Western clichés, notably the final shootout between the Kid and his enemies the Plummer brothers and the Indian attack on the stagecoach, thwarted by the timely arrival of the cavalry. (Would a skillful tactician like Geronimo really have wasted the lives of so many warriors in order to capture a target of negligible military value? At least a dozen Indians are picked off by the unerring marksmanship of Hatfield and the Kid). In 1939, however, scenes like these must have seemed much fresher than they do today, although even then they were probably not completely original, given the vast number of Westerns churned out in the twenties and thirties. Ford, however, manages to bring considerable excitement to these scenes, especially the attack on the coach. There are a number of excellent acting contributions, something essential in a film of this nature which depends upon characterisation and upon bringing out the contrasting personalities of the travellers. Those that stand out are from Wayne, from Trevor as the prostitute Dallas, from Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone and from John Carradine as the slightly dubious Hatfield.The film is based upon a 1937 short story by Ernest Haycox, but there are also similarities to Guy de Maupassant's short story, "Boule de Suif", another story of a wartime journey by stagecoach which also features a prostitute as one of the main characters. As in de Maupassant's story, it is the seemingly disreputable characters who reveal their moral strengths, whereas the ostensibly respectable ones are exposed as cowardly, hypocritical or dishonest. Dallas proves to have hidden reserves of decency, the wanted criminal the Ringo Kid displays great courage in fighting off an attack by hostile Indians and the drunken Doc Boone manages successfully to deliver a baby when Mrs Mallory unexpectedly goes into labour. The pompous banker Henry Gatewood turns out to have embezzled $50,000 from his bank.Like most Westerns from this period "Stagecoach" is based on a good-guys-versus-bad-guys morality, with the added twist that a whore and an outlaw can turn out to be good guys, and a respected pillar of society turn out to be a common thief. Much of the appeal of this film lies in the fact that it is a celebration of life in the Old West and yet subtly subverts the conventions of the Western genre in precisely this manner, presenting us with something both reassuringly familiar and yet also refreshingly different. It is an exciting tale of adventure, a morality play and a study in characterisation. It is also one of my favourite westerns of all time- perhaps second only to "High Noon". 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach was released in 1939. It is the story of a stagecoach traveling to Lordsburg, New Mexico during an Apache uprising. The passengers are from all walks of life and are heading to Lordsburg for a variety of reasons. The drunken doctor and the outcast woman are forced out of town by societal prejudice. The whiskey peddler is heading home to his wife and children in Kansas City (Kansas, not Missouri, as he often points out). The banker is sneaking out of town for mysterious reasons. The other woman is going to meet her husband, who is in the cavalry, and the gambler boards at the last minute to protect her. The driver wants to turn back for fear of the Apaches, but the sheriff riding shotgun won't let him stop his pursuit of an escaped convict. Last but not least, John Wayne, the convict, called the Ringo Kid is picked up along the way. He busted out of prison and is going to Lordsburg to avenge the murder of his father and brother by Luke Plumber. These are the main characters, but Stagecoach also has many memorable supporting characters. My favorite has to be the Mexican man at one of the stops who always ends his sentences in "I think" ("Si senora, I think.") I'd forgotten about him over the years.The film boasts an ensemble cast, most of whom were much more established actors than John Wayne at the time and some of them would go on to be regulars in his later films. Andy Devine, with his always recognizable pre-pubescent like voice, plays the driver. Thomas Mitchell, who plays the doctor, always did the best drunk, it seems like he played one in all of his films. And Claire Trevor plays the outcast woman. Fifteen years later, Wayne and Trevor starred in another film together, The High and The Mighty. This time their star status is reversed. Trevor is an aging, once well- known actress, while Wayne is at the peak of his stardom.Stagecoach is a significant film for a number of reasons. First, it was John Wayne's breakthrough role. He'd had his first starring role in 1930 in The Big Trail, but then spent to next nine years making low budget B westerns and serials. Stagecoach was another chance at an A list film and one that finally earned him some notoriety. It was also Wayne's first starring role for director John Ford. He had done stunts and bit parts for Ford as early as 1928, but Stagecoach was the real beginning of a lifelong friendship and famed working relationship. They would go on to make another thirteen pictures together over the next twenty-four years, along with various television projects. Stagecoach was also the first time Ford shot in his beloved location of Monument Valley, where he produced a total of nine of his films. Finally, and perhaps most importantly, many consider Stagecoach to be the film that raised, not only John Wayne, but the western genre from B movie to A-list status. And lest you think I overstate the films influence, it is said that Orson Welles viewed Stagecoach around forty times before making his masterpiece. Citizen Kane.Several years ago, I had a discussion with a co-worker about American History X and its use of black and white photography during the flashbacks. Apparently, the director had said that you always have to have a good reason to use black and white, before explaining his reasons. I accepted this as at the time, but I later began to question it. Why do you have to have a good reason to shoot in black and white? It's not a flaw that technology fixed with the advent of color, it's an equally valid art form. In fact, Welles once said "You know what I say about black and white? It's the actor's friend, because every performance is better in black and white. Name me a great performance in color."What does this all have to do with Stagecoach? This viewing of it was the first time I've gained a full appreciation for black and white. I'd never realized how much more beautifully pronounced light and shadows can be in black and white. Paying attention to the shadows in the interior shots of the film was quite mesmerizing.I recently read a journal entry of Roger Ebert's in which he states: "Two of the most wonderful props in film noir were cigarettes and hats. They added interest to a close up or a two-shot." Though not a noir, I found a perfect example of this in Stagecoach. The stagecoach is traveling through some major winds. All the passengers are bundled up with their heads down to fend it off. Just the top of Wayne's hat is shown. He looks up at Trevor, his face still half concealed by the hat, and she looks back at him briefly. It's a wonderful shot in a brief but important moment between the two characters.Though not his masterpiece (which is debatably,The Searchers), Ford directed Stagecoach masterfully. He utilized Monument Valley perfectly with many beautiful landscape shots. The way he shot the ending is ingenious. The entire climatic shootout is only heard off screen. This may seem like an odd choice, but it is the unexpected and greatly adds to the tension of the scene.Thanks to time, experience, and Criterion's wonderful restoration, my appreciation for Stagecoach has increased exponentially. I suspect I'll be revisiting more of Wayne and Ford's great movies soon in hopes of a similar new experience?Check out this and other reviews at: notexactlyaquote.tumblr.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a movie great for western fans</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a classic action western film. This film stars John Wayne, in a classic masculine role. When the cast was attacked by the natives in the stage coach, it was by far the most exciting part of the movie. The special effects were similar to those you see today. There were gun shots, men being thrown off horses, horses falling down hills. It was very realistic. Also when the stagecoach needed to cross the river, and the horses were up to head level in the water, this scene shows how well trained the horses are.This movie had many great special effects. The story was a little hard to get into at first, but it is definitely worth seeing. I did not really understand when exactly Dallas and Ringo made the connection they did, but it works for the story. Miss. Mallory having a baby was very confusing; I didn't even know she was pregnant. This movie was very action packed, and is good for anyone who is a fan of westerns.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Everyone is just colorful, and subtle, enough to lift the story above its form, its impeccable construction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939)John Ford created archetypes as much as he used them, and the stature of John Wayne as an American conservative icon, and a movie star, starts here. The story, and the characters, around him are the larger-than-life basis of America and the West--making good in the face of adversity, courting prejudice as well as fighting it, having an eternal sense of humor and need for love.Not that any of this is solely American turf--and so Ford is cruising through the archetypes of any society. Everyone here is a familiar type, exaggerated just enough to be clear for the viewer, but complicated enough to be believable and interesting. Everyone in this little container on wheels (the stagecoach) is flawed, and yet everyone (except maybe the greedy banker) is good deep down. The yearning gambler, the displaced prostitute, the refined lady, the wise doctor, the earnest sheriff, and most of all the troubled young man ready to make his life over again, and take the most fundamental of human steps, settling down and having a family.The movie is tightly constructed and has moral and logical clarity (no wonder Orson Welles watched if forty times while making Citizen Kane). It can be seen as a sequences of distinct parts--the setup in town where we learn the types, the first stretch of the ride, the stop in Dry Fork, and so on. If the story slows up for some (the long break in the middle where they all sit to eat) or is a little redundant (lots of shooting and hollering in the famous chase near the end), the whole makes sense with these changes of pace, which are part of the balance. Characterizations are as vivid as the actors who pull them off--character actors coaxed (and bullied) by Ford to their subtle and not so subtle best--and without too much bland stereotyping (the whiskey seller is a bit thin). The camera-work feels like the best of what you might see in the earlier 1930s in some Warners gangster films, which is probably Ford's visual sensibility even in 1939, when this came out, and if there is a weakness to the movie, the visuals might be it (and if Welles saw this flaw, he made up for it nicely in Kane).And 1939, that year, as the world plunges into darkness across both oceans, issues of morality, tolerance, and, in the end, escape ("safe from civilization") are on everyone's mind. Could this film have been made earlier? Maybe not--the public was used to Westerns being cheesy or cheap B-movies. That an independent producer (Wanger) and little known star (Wayne) were lifted to A-list quality and exposure is a small wonder. Ford had the vision to pull it off when the public was ready for it, and Stagecoach, a study of character above all, was a commercial success. But he wasn't alone. Three other mainstream Westerns are remembered from 1939, and if you watch even one other you'll see that the fine-tuned perfection of the studio system is lifting all the boats: Destry Rides Again (a spoof with Stewart and Dietrich), Jesse James (with Fonda), and Dodge City (directed by Curtiz).You'll also see that Ford's contribution is special among them. Stagecoach is enjoyable a second and third time even though you know all the little twists, like the three bullets set aside after the Indian chase, or the last moments of the film, which leave the audience cheering a little, too. It's just that tightly made.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wayne's Stagecoach!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939): Dir: John Ford / Cast: Claire Trevor, John Wayne, John Carradine, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine: Early adult western using its title as a term for vessel regarding the lives and personal dilemmas of the characters. It stars John Wayne as Ringo the Kid who is arrested and placed on a stagecoach that is set for dangerous territory. There are two women, one pregnant and wishing to reunite with her husband who is serving in the war. The other is a prostitute ignored by all except Ringo. Other characters include a Sheriff and a drunken doctor. Adventurous and exciting with an ending of simplistic violence that seems cliché even for those days. Tremendous work by director John Ford with a highlighted pursuit by Indians. Ford would go on to become one of the most impressive directors in the business. Claire Trevor is clearly the lead here as she struggles to maintain her dignity and finds sympathy from Ringo. John Wayne expresses regret in his eyes yet dutifully accepts condemnation. Unfortunately the showdown in the conclusion hasn't the dramatic power that it was perhaps intended to have. Great supporting work by John Carradine, and Thomas Mitchell as the doctor. Both have their moments of scene stealing as they reach their destination. Andy Devine plays the stagecoach driver. A trend is set for westerns showcasing great production showcasing the excitement.

		<shortDescription>My favourite John Wayne film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A stagecoach encounters danger on its journey to Lordsburg. Among the passengers are a drunken doctor, a pregnant soldier's wife, a bank manager who has run off with his customer's money, a southern gentlemen/gambler, a 'loose' woman chased out of town and the Ringo Kid.I think the key plot is not the story of the passengers battling against the Indians, again with the Indians but the romance between Ringo and Dallas, two outcasts from "normal society." Ringo because he has escaped from prison and Dallas as she is considered a loose woman, this is only hinted at in the film. Ringo treats Dallas like a lady unlike everyone else around her. It is a very tender romance and you hope at the end that they will get together but they have obstacles in their way, Ringo is on his way to kill the men responsible for his brother's murder and Dallas doesn't want Ringo to know about her past and knows it will come out if she stays with him. The chemistry works really well between Claire Trevor and John Wayne.The film is about how judgemental people can be if they see other people not fitting into the way society rules. Ringo, Doc and Dallas are regarded as the dregs of society and it is only when the people classed as decent members of society are in a life and death situation and spend time with the 'dregs', they learn to look past their initial judgements.This is John Wayne's breakthrough role from B movies to the big screen. Even at this point, there is leading man qualities. He has a tinkle in his eyes, he is a lot more easy going as a character in this film then any other film I have seen him in.The cinematography is amazing even though it is in black and white. It shows the vastness of the west and how desolate it was in those days with nothing around for miles.John Ford builds up the tension especially at the end when Ringo goes to kill Plummer and Ford keeps the audience on tenterhooks about whether Ringo will survive and you cheer when he does because you want the film to end with these likable characters going off together in the sunset.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach sets a standard for all westerns but it seems to be more than that. By tying together the lives of its different characters in a unique way, it manages to bring each of them alive. Who can ever forget some of those scenes? I first saw this film about 50 years ago and I can't count the number of times I've seen it since. Just writing about it makes me want to pop the tape in and see it again. I have not always admired John Wayne's work but in this film his is more than a stereotype of himself. And Claire Trevor? Her husky voice gives me goose bumps every time I hear it. Andy Devine is the perfect stage coach driver "Next stop Lordsburg" and Carradine's character - so much like John Wilkes Booth - is perfect. And, if your doctor must be a drinking man, "Stagecoach's" is the one you need!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Nine disparate characters - a fearless outlaw, a big-hearted strumpet, a drunken doctor, a canny sheriff, a suave gambler, a society lady, a timid salesman, a pompous banker and a cheerful driver - ride the stage together across Apache country, headed towards danger and an uncertain future.This film is rightly praised as the first great western, and invented many of the classic icons of the genre. Like all great movies, it's also a wonderful drama filled with fascinating and memorable characters. It is beautifully judged by Ford to play as both a spectacular action film set against a fabulous backdrop (the gorgeous Monument Valley in Utah) and as a brilliant character study as folks from every walk of life are thrown together into a desperate situation. The entire ensemble give tremendous performances - Wayne is brilliant in the keynote role of the Ringo Kid, but Trevor, Mitchell and Bancroft and particularly Carradine as a Southern Gentleman rogue are all terrific. Almost every scene has a poetic quality to it, enhanced by the traditional score (six people worked on the music) and the wonderful dialogue, and the Injun attack sequence (featuring amazing stuntwork by the great Yakima Canutt) remains a textbook example of how to shoot and cut an action scene for maximum impact and entertainment value. Being British, and a child of the late twentieth-century, I'm not a particular fan of classical westerns because it's hard for me to get into that good old American frontier freedom sensibility. Despite that, I can identify easily with every single one of the characters in this movie (except maybe the banker), and that's what makes this a great picture for me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the finest examples of the standard western, a good introduction to John Ford and a small hint as to the reason behind Wayne's popularity.The film handles an unremarkable story expertly. Throughout the course of their hazardous journey, nine people randomly stuck together display a range of emotions and interact in various interesting (and often witty) ways that are made more pleasurable by their fleeting nature. In fact, the only mistake the lingering close-ups on the wounded Trevor, when Ford is a little over-zealous about emphasizing her hurt. However, the now-cliche theme of prostitute-with-a-heart-of-gold is done very well, in a fashion that stands fresh amongst much of today's.Monument Valley is beautiful, though Ford focuses on it perhaps a bit too much. There's the expected stereotyped Mexican characters and some of the characters are a little over-acted, but the sincerity of the piece is tangible.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The first for Ford and The Duke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Imagine you are 25 year old Orson Welles watching this one more than three dozen times as he works on his masterpiece Citizen Kane. Such is the influence of John Ford's Stagecoach. It may or may not be the greatest western film of all-time (a matter of preference), but it's inarguably the most influential.More than 75 years later, it's difficult to imagine a time when John Ford and John Wayne weren't joined at the swaggering hip making movies together. By 1939, Ford had won an Oscar for The Informer (1935) but had not directed a western in more than a decade, while John Wayne's career to this point consisted of bit parts and B movies. The "firsts" here include: John Ford's first movie with John Wayne, the first movie filmed in Monument Valley, Ford's first talkie-western, and the first starring role in a major motion picture for John Wayne Probably the most iconic star-making screen ever is that first shot of John Wayne twirling and cocking the rifle as the camera zooms in on his face. It should be noted that The Duke was wearing his own cowboy hat ? one he would wear in many movies over the years (until it finally was in such bad shape, it was placed in a glass display case at Mr. Wayne's home).Dudley Nichols (Oscar winning screenwriter for Ford's The Informer) adapted the original story from Ernest Haycox into a screenplay that examines the early attempts at transitioning the "wild west" into a more civilized society. Social commentary abounds as several characters from disparate background are crammed into a confined space (the titular stagecoach) for an extended period of time. Some viewers may complain about the use of clichés, but in fairness, what we have come to label as cliché, was anything but at the time.Adding their own special touch to the wide range of characters were some of the finest actors of the era. Claire Trevor was the best known star in the cast at the time, and she plays Dallas, the good-hearted woman whose past/profession causes her to be treated as an outcast by most in the group. Ms. Trevor would go on to win a Best Supporting Oscar for Key Largo (1948). Donald Meek plays the meek travelling salesman ironically named Peacock. John Carradine is perfectly cast as Hatfield, the elegant gambler carrying a secret. Drunken Doc Boone is played by Thomas Mitchell, who many will recognize as Uncle Billy in It's a Wonderful Life. Louise Platt plays Lucy Mallory, the pregnant wife who is on a mission to reunite with her soldier husband. The villainous banker is played with gusto by Berton Churchill, and Law Enforcement is represented by Marshal Wilcox, played by George Bancroft. The stagecoach is driven by the great Andy Devine (as Buck). Mr. Devine manages to create a bit of comedy relief by the use of his trademark high-pitched raspy voice. Other notables making an appearance are Tom Tyler (once known as the strongest man in America), Woody Strode (one of the saloon patrons) who is known best for his fight scene in Spartacus; and Tim Holt who brings the charging Calvary to the rescue, and is best known as one of the prospectors in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (1948).Of course, it's John Ford and John Wayne who draw most of the attention when this film is discussed. The Duke plays bad-guy-with-a-heart Ringo Kid, and gets to show a pretty full spectrum of machismo, humanity, dignity and sensitivity. His extraordinary physical screen presence led him to the top of the film world with roles in some of the most popular films over the next 4 decades, capped by a Best Actor Oscar for True Grit (1969). John Ford won 4 Best Director Oscars (plus two special Oscars for his WWII documentaries): The Informer (1935), The Grapes of Wrath (1940), How Green was my Valley (1942), and The Quiet Man (1952).Two others deserve special mention. The movie provides Stuntman extraordinaire Yakima Canutt the opportunity for what may be his best and most daring stunt ? leaping onto the moving stagecoach and its 6 horse team and then sliding down under the carriage and out the back ? all at breakneck speed! It's fascinating to watch, and in this age of computerized special effects, it demands a level of awe and respect. While this film provided the first on screen glimpse of Monument Valley, it was Cinematographer Bert Glennon who figured out the best ways to take advantage of this breathtaking setting. Mr. Glennon was nominated for 3 Oscars (including Stagecoach), and was a frequent collaborator with both John Ford and Cecil B DeMille.Stagecoach received 7 Oscar nominations including wins for Thomas Mitchell as Best Supporting Actor and Best Music (score) for Richard Hagerman, W Frank Harling, John Leipold, Leo Shuken. The other nominees were for Best Picture, Best Director (Ford), Best Cinematographer, Best Art Direction and Best Editing. 1939 is considered by many to be the best ever year for movies: Gone with the Wind; Mr Smith Goes to Washington; Wuthering Heights; Goodbye, Mr Chips; Ninotchka; The Wizard of Oz; Of Mice and Men; The Hunchback of Notre Dame; Young Mr Lincoln.Despite being the first movie to feature the "dead man's hand" ? a pair of black aces and a pair of black eights (the hand Wild Bill Hickok was holding when he was gunned down), this film continues to live on in cinematic lore and is often included in the discussion of the best westerns of all-time. It was a joyful experience to finally get to see this one on the big screen in a theatre setting. It's clear how this film elevated the western genre, and it certainly deserved recognition by the National Film Registry in 1995.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What a movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I give this movie a 10 because that is as high as the IMDb scale goes. Otherwise I would give it a 30, or a 300, or ....Everything, but everything, is right in this movie. It deals with basic human emotion, presented in a very fundamental way that hits you over and over again right in the gut. It is as 'true' to human nature as any movie could be.You see all the basic human virtues and vices here. But what most impressed me is that you see something Hollywood seems to have forgotten altogether: basic human decency. The way Ringo (John Wayne) treats Dallas (Claire Trevor), whom some of the other riders on the stagecoach ostracize because she appears to have been a prostitute, goes to the very basis of what we should all admire as human decency. He isn't nice to her because he wants to be 'nice'. God forbid. He is good to her because she is good to others. She earns his respect, just as Mary Magdaleine earns that of the Christ.The cinematography in this movie is astounding. You see painting after painting, carefully composed.But it is the presentation of basic human virtues, stripped of all social pretense, that hits you in the gut. And no movie does that better than this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of John Ford's Best Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's "Stagecoach" boasts dynamic characters with satisfying arcs, classic thrills, a breakthrough performance by John Wayne, charismatic set pieces, as well as a charismatic director--it is rightfully deemed one of the most influential Westerns. Wayne's performance is restrained and charming, and among his other stagecoach colleagues are an empathetic prostitute driven out of town, suitably named Dallas (Claire Trevor), the vulnerable stagecoach driver Buck (Andy Devine), an alcoholic and shameless doctor Boone (Thomas Mitchell), a cowardly whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek), a rigorous marshal Curly (George Bancroft), the mysterious gambler Hatfield (John Carradine), an unlikable banker Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), and a stressed wife Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt). With these characters--empathetic, sympathetic, mysterious, charming, likable, unlikable--all crammed in a claustrophobic stagecoach, we ultimately get a character study with Western thrills thrown in there to fill us with anxiety in losing one of them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Rebirth of the Westerns !!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stagecoach' is a landmark film in film history. First of all it is the film that led to the rebirth of the Western as a genre to be given importance and attention after it had been relegated to B-movie status with overused clichés and tropes. This is the film that undeniably put John Wayne on the map and pushed him on his way to stardom. This is also the film that re- energised John Ford's career as a major Hollywood filmmaker.The screenplay of 'Stagecoach' written by Dudley Nichols is based on the short story 'The Stage to Lordsburg' written by Ernest Haycox. The storyline for the film is deceptively simple. On the outside it looks like a ensemble piece with different characters coming from different walks of life put together on a journey which we have seen over and over again to some extent as a result of this very film's influence on filmmakers and screenwriters. But in a subtle way, the film is an exploration and a study of the class divide existing in the American society at the time which was the time of the great depression. Ford and Nichols are championing the rights of the downtrodden and frowned upon in the societal system through the film. The characters like Dallas, Doc Boone and the Ringo Kid i.e. the receivers of social prejudice are the ones who get treated with the most sympathy by Ford. While the banker gets mocked which must have been a reflection of the public sentiments of the era. In a way the stagecoach itself is a metaphor for the birth of America as a nation.The script is good, but Ford's direction is absolutely brilliant and it is what makes the film. His camera movement itself is extremely expressive. The pans, the tracking shots and static shots are all very expressive. Some of the examples of these breathtaking shots are - the static shot where the stagecoach and the troops part ways, the static shot where Ringo in the foreground watches Dallas walk away from the camera down the passage in a straight line darkened by the shadows and then when she crosses the door, a glistening light falls on her and she almost ends up looking like an angelic figure(which is very meaningful), the shot where the camera pans away to reveal the Native Americans looking on,etc. But the most famous and iconic shot has to be the zoom-in which introduces Wayne in the film. The bravura with which Ford introduces Ringo Kid here reminded me strongly of Scorsese's introduction of De Niro's character Johnny Boy in 'Mean Streets'. These have to be two of the most badass character introductions in film history. The film also clearly is a call back to the silent era. Ford's composition and certain dramatic choices are very reminiscent of silent films.This brings me to the action sequence in the film. 'Stagecoach' is a Western, but to be honest it doesn't depend on the familiar generic swashbuckling elements of the genre. Ford takes his time to build the storyline and explore the characters and make us familiar with them. He doesn't feel the need to be unnecessarily flashy. But when the action hits, it hits harder than the viewer will ever expect especially from a film made in the 1930s. This action sequence which is basically a chase is edited in the most fast paced way with the intertwining of static camera as well as moving camera shots. The shots where the camera moves along with the running horses are awe- inspiring and are bound to get the adrenaline flowing through your body. Some of the stunts performed in this scene are extraordinary. The way Ford captures the beauty and elegance in the simplicity of a bunch of horses running fast is amazing. I can see the influence of this particular scene in films that came decades later like the Indiana Jones series or Mad Max Fury Road.One aspect of the film that can easily turn people off in today's day and age is the way the film treats Native Americans. If this film offends viewers, I can completely understand that. Even though the social politics in the film is something that no one will have a problem in supporting, but the racial politics can leave a large section of viewers cold. This is because the Native Americans are nothing but villains here. That's it. Their motivations, their characters are not explored. Now in order to admire the film one has to accept this as a mindset of the past. But some won't be able to overlook this and I can completely understand that.The acting is very solid from everyone involved. Although John Wayne is in the film, but the narrative doesn't revolve around him. He is a part of the ensemble and 'Stagecoach' is first and foremost an ensemble piece. This is a film about a group of people going together on a journey. Every character either undergoes a change or experience self discovery. But the humanity of the film I believe lies with the character Dallas expertly and affectionately played by Claire Trevor. The heart of the film is the cute and innocent romance between Dallas and Ringo. What makes this romance work is the fact that Ford allows the romance to develop and prosper through sharing of affectionate glances, small acts of kindness and lack of judgments instead of flashy, over-the-top romantic gestures. Thomas Mitchell also deserves a special mention for perfectly playing the role of the alcoholic but kind-hearted Doctor Boone.'Stagecoach' was a great introduction for me into the filmography of one of the most revered and influential American directors of all times. Once you accept the fact that the racial politics is a reflection of the time in which the film was made, you will be able to admire and appreciate a master director at work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"There are some things a man just can't run away from."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is one of the first western that drew the attention of the audience. John Ford directed his first sound western, which is also a very modern movie. The film, which is definitely the foundations genre. Set design could be a bit better. The story is one of the best in the history of cinema. The acting is top notch.This film is a milestone in the careers of director and lead actor. The story may not be original but it is great. I appreciate movies where each character in the story gets space. I would not go so far as to say that every character becomes a segment involved in the story. On peculiarities of the characters the story is based. This is perfection.John Wayne as Henry "The Ringo Kid" is a young rancher, a fugitive from prison in search of revenge and a sense of his future life. Wayne was an amazing authority, at times with his statements and act as if the whole world is his. I am glad that Ford was not overly forced his character, because it would have the opposite effect. Claire Trevor as Dallasis very attractive lady of pleasure, although a better description was "on the verge of prostitutes" because the contempt related to her. Extremely strong female character. A brave woman with a big heart, capable to love and nurture. Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone is a doctor and an alcoholic. It's hard to determine what's on better. Alcohol humiliates his profession, but at the same time raises his humanity. Other characters are also excellent. Southern gentleman and elegant gambler Hatfield (J. Carradine), haughty heroine and pregnant wife cavalry officer Lucy Mallory (L. Platt), feminine whiskey merchant Samuel Peacock (D. Meek), evil and treacherous banker Henry Gatewood (B. Churchill) stagecoach operated temperamental and screeching Buck (A. Devine). All of them watchful eye observes and analyzes Sheriff Curly Wilcox (G. Bancroft).Ford in this film dramaturgical structure whose end also brings a denouement developed to perfection, impressive character profiling a group of very diverse people face significant risks, gradually revealing the true nature of all of them and in the center puts romance hearted girl formal dubious morals and boys also formally outside Act. Ford and subtle moralist who never condemned, indeed, an impressive realist, and a great director of action sequences, and innovator and respects the genre.Stagecoach is a film that exudes freshness and stays long in the memory.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Like many of the other films in it's genre, the label of "Western" very accurately describes the film. The cinematography of this film accurately follows the action of the film and the vision of the director as to where the audience should be looking and when. This film uses sound to help connect the viewers to the action happening in the film and furthermore made the film that much more realistic. The scenery for this film has to be the strongest element. It's realisticness is such that it makes viewers believe that this was actually happening which leads to further enjoyment by the audience. The intensity of this movie also left the audience on the edge of their seats which tends to leave a lasting effect on them. This genre is not for everyone so if this doesn't sound appealing to you, you probably shouldn't watch it!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a movie that I think was not that bad but also not the best. I have watched westerns all my life because my dad is a really big fan of them and because of that I am a decent sized fan of them. This was John Wayne's first good movie that allowed him to get to be the legend that he is today so this movie does have historical significance. But it is was not my favorite western of all time and isn't really one that I would recommend watching more then once. One of the things that I like to take in consideration when saying whether or not a movie is on my favorites list or one that I would recommend to others is its rewatchability and the second time that I watched this movie I couldn't really get through its without felling really bored. With all these negative things I am saying about this film you would probably be wondering why I gave it a 6 because thats a pretty high score. Well the first time I watched this movie t was actually pretty enjoyable because It has tons of different personality's and I especially liked the Doctor. So all and all I would recommend the movie to people if they have never seen it and they like westerns but it is not a very good rewatchable movie in my eyes and if your not already a fan of westerns I don't think that this movie is good enough to sway you into liking them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Waynes softer side</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was never really a huge fan of old westerners, but my dad always watched them so I of course always knew who John Wayne was. I did enjoy watching Stagecoach in cinema class and think that it is one of John Wayne's best films. John Wayne seemed to have more of a softer side in this movie than other movies I have seen him in, because he had a love interest in this one and tells her to live with him on his ranch. In other movies I've seen he just treats women like they are a pain. It was a huge surprise to the audience when we find out that the woman is pregnant, because they tried to hide it so much in films back in the 30's. For a movie back in the 30's it had some pretty good cinematography and shots of the dessert.Stagecoach was John Fords first Sound western and his first time back to making westerners after 13 years and Stagecoach instantly became a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I very much so enjoyed this movie. This is the first fist movie i have ever seen with John Wayne and it wont be my last he seemed to be a very good actor in this film. The movie was about a group of people leaving a town to go through Apache country. however nobody on the stage coach knew that until it was time to leave. there were many unexpected twists and turns in this film as nobody could tell weather or not who was aginsed one another. this movie i believe really shows that you shouldn't judge a book by its cover. what i mean by this is that the Outlaw ends up falling in love with a prostitute and she was treated very unfairly until John Wayne comes along and shows everyone that if you respect someone that you will get respect in return.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a well rounded western movie. It is layered with Action, Adventure, Romance, Drama, Suspense, etc. In my own personal taste, I really like films that pull off all those amazing scenes to really intensify our visuals and "Stagecoach" is a prime example. All the characters we learn one by one and step by step makes this film much more progressive to the audiences knowledge as the movie goes along. Doc Boone was my least favorite character. I thought that his role as being a "drunk" was a bit over the top and played out at times. He had some amazing scenes and great lines, but I think the humor he had as a drunk, just taking booze from the character openly. Other than that, this was a great movie that I really enjoyed watching for the first time.</fullReview>

I'm still not entirely sure what the point of it was, The main mention of the movie was about some guy named jeronemo? but i thought that was a place? So many different things were going on that it made it hard to keep track of everyones problem. Out of no where a baby showed up in the end with no prior back story saying its mother was pregnant, people were constantly shooting, and for what?

		<fullReview>All in all the movie showed a lot of promise but had certain things held it back. I felt as though the acting was pretty stale and lacked a lot of emotion and genuineness. I also didn't enjoyed the sloppily done love story between Dallas and Ringo. It didn't feel right to me as if it was kinda forced into the story, just not executed properly in my opinion. I did however like the fact that the movie focused on the relationships between characters and how each of their story lines played out nicely. The action in the movie was also very good, it felt very real and was very exhilarating to watch. The setting and sets were also very well shot in that it gave the viewer a scope of how vast and perilous their journey really was. All in all the movie was pretty good, their are certain things I could nit-pick at but that would take away from what the movie is about, the hero getting the girl and defeating the his enemies, and in that respect it does it pretty well.</fullReview>

She seemed to be the center of attention when the movie first started and the attention slowly to focus more on the other girl as the movie went on. That kind of threw me off. Something else that threw me off was when the mysterious guy from the beginning was going to shoot the girl with one of his last bullets. I was curious to know his reasoning for it? I just felt like it was a pointless scene and all I could do was question why he would do something like that. Even though there was a couple of things that threw me off, the movie was still enjoyable because it included some twists to it and included a lot of action and even some romance.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really enjoyed this movie. It was very fast paced and I liked that a lot, it kept things very interesting. There were also so many stereotypical characters in it which made it fun to watch as one of the first western films, and it was cool to see where the basis for the rest of the films in this genre sprouted from. It was a very typical western film, when I think of a western I think of exactly what happened in this film; Indian and Cowboys fighting, drama, gossip, suspense. I also enjoyed the character development, for example Miss Mallory was so against even sitting near Dallas at the start of the film, but by the end of the film she was holding her baby and they became friends. The shootout scene towards the end was also really intense and I liked how it happened while they were all on the go, whether it be in the stagecoach or on horseback. I especially liked when the gambler had a gun right against Miss Mallory's head and she didn't even notice, but he got shot down before he could pull the trigger. It was intense and suspenseful even if it was only for a few seconds of not knowing what would happen. The last shootout scene was incredible, you think the film is over and all is well but it isn't. I liked that Ringo saved three bullets from the Indian shoot out because he knew he would have to use them against the brothers who were after him. Overall it was a really fast paced and intriguing film.</fullReview>

It was funny to see how the doctor was sobered right up with just black coffee and a few cups of weather splashed in his face.. seeing the film taking place on top of the stage couch was very cool, to see something like that taking place on such an old film was great.

		<shortDescription>This Is One 'Stagecoach' That's Powered by a 'Ford'!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Several characters from all walks of life board a stagecoach, bound for Lordsburg. The mixed coach-load of stock characters include "Doc" Boone, a tipsy man of medicine; Major Hatfield, a professional gambler and once a Southern gentleman; Dallas, a lady of such transparently dubious virtue that she was leaving Tonto by popular request; Mrs. Mallory, who, given her condition, has every reason to be hastening to her army husband's side; Mr. Gatewood, an absconding banker and windbag; Mr. Peacock, a small and timid whiskey salesman; Sheriff Wilcox and his prisoner, the Ringo Kid (played by John Wayne with effortless authority).Onward rolls the stage, nobly sped by its six stout-hearted bays, and out there, somewhere behind the buttes and crags, Geronimo is lurking with his savage band, the United States Cavalry is biding its time to charge to the rescue and the Ringo Kid is impatiently awaiting his cue to stalk down the frontier-town street and blast it out with the three Plummer boys. Worse, tension arises from within the coach as the different social classics begin to mix. Confined for a good deal of the film inside the stagecoach, these characters create a fascinating community as they gradually reveal their hidden reasons for traveling in great discomfort through hazardous Indian territory.Seen today, 'Stagecoach' may not seem very original. That's because it influenced countless later movies in which a mixed bag of characters are thrown together by chance and forced to survive an ordeal. But here the notion seems as fresh as a prairie daisy. In taking an ensemble cast on a perilous journey across back-projected landscapes, John Ford classically constructs and superbly directs the maiden voyage of a celebrated cliché - with a climax that's one of the great masterpieces of editing and clearly one of the greatest stunt sequences of all time, sustaining interest and suspense throughout. Additionally, Ford ventures into Monument Valley for the first time, and instinctively uses the Western landscape as an artistic, emotional, and physical enhancement for the on screen drama, rather than just a backdrop. But even aside from all these advances, Stagecoach holds our attention effortlessly and is paced with the elegance of a symphony.The greatest enjoyment in watching Stagecoach is in observing how John Ford builds and populates this moral universe, in seeing complex personalities sketched in simple words or gestures. He doesn't squander his action and violence in an attempt to whore for those with short attention spans, but tells a story, during which we learn to know the characters and become invested in them. This is one stagecoach that's powered by a Ford!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the best westerns ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a shortened review. For my full length reviews, please visit: http://guywithamovieblog.blogspot.com/Stagecoach is a relatively simple film from a plot perspective. Nine individuals are on a stagecoach trip from Tonto, Arizona, to Lordsburg, New Mexico. Along the way, they have to deal with personal prejudices, weather conditions, a baby being born, and the dangers of traveling through Apache country while Geronimo is on the warpath.Claire Trevor, a fairly successful and "name brand" actress at the time, had top billing and one of the largest roles as Dallas, a prostitute who is being forced to leave Tonto on the coach. The ladies of "The Law and Order League" are trying to clean up their town and also send the drunk, amiable Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) on his way. He joins Dallas on the coach, along with a whiskey salesman (Samuel Peacock, played by Donald Meek), the pregnant Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt), a Southern gentleman and card shark (Hatfield, slyly played by John Carradine), and Ellsworth Gatewood (Berton Churchill), the town's banker who's recently embezzled $50,000 and is fleeing the scene of the crime. Driving the coach is Buck (played by the wonderful Andy Devine) and Marshal Wilcox (George Bancroft) is riding shotgun.Along the way, they come across the Ringo Kid, an escaped fugitive played by John Wayne. Ringo seems to be a nice guy who simply got himself into some trouble, but he also broke out of prison with the lone goal of killing Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler) and his brothers as retribution for killing his own father and brother. There's a long history between the families, but the audience is only given the slightest information - just enough to keep us wondering just what kind of men Ringo and the Plummers are.Wayne is rather good in Stagecoach and impressed me with his relaxed manner in some scenes and quiet intensity in others. Ringo is a complex character and Wayne is able to play all the angles really well. Wayne had been toiling away in "B" pictures - as everything from a crew member, stuntman, and actor - for over a decade, but Stagecoach was his big break. Ford insisted on casting Wayne, even refusing to change his mind after numerous studios passed on the film because of Wayne's attachment. Luckily, Ford eventually got to make his film the way he wanted, and cinema history was changed forever. Wayne, of course, became one of the biggest stars of all-time and spent the next three decades entertaining millions of people, eventually becoming a true Hollywood icon.Wayne's character isn't introduced until about the twenty minute mark, but it's a fantastic introduction. Some terrific editing and a quick zoom add up to a shot that I'll remember for ages. Ford seemed to be saying, "Here's John Wayne. You don't know him, but you'll never forget him now." The rest of the cast is in fine form, too, especially Mitchell, who has probably the showiest role as the habitually intoxicated Doc Boone. There are definite comedic moments at the expense of Boone's alcoholism, but Mitchell never plays it too far over the top, so there's always a human side in sight. Mitchell gets to shine in both funny and serious scenes and went on to win the Best Supporting Actor Academy Award for the role. It was a well-earned award, no doubt.I'd also like to highlight the work of Andy Devine as Buck. I've only recently discovered Devine (after watching The Man Who Shot Liberty Vallance), but after seeing him in these two films, I'm excited to see more of his work. Devine has a very unusual voice, but it instantly lends pathos to his performances and helps him create interesting, uncommon characters. In Stagecoach, Buck is a bit of a coward, ready to turn and retreat at the first signs of trouble, but once the trouble arrives, he doesn't shrink away. Devine's folksy performance immediately pulled me in and I rooted for Buck during the entire film.The lone performance that I think fell flat was Churchill as the scheming banker, Gatewood. He just comes across as a little too one dimensional and I didn't really care about him one way or the other, unlike the rest of the characters, who I were emotionally invested in. Gatewood seems like a stock character and nothing more. I think the blame for this can be spread in three different directions: To Churchill, Ford, and the screenwriter Dudley Nichols. Churchill gives a mostly lifeless performance, but he wasn't aided by his director or writer. There are a couple of moments near the beginning of the film where Ford lingers on closeups of Gatewood, hitting the audience over the head with the message "This guy's no good and can't be trusted!" Both shots really struck me as odd and hurt the film's flow and made Gatewood seem like a silly character. And Nichols just didn't seem to put much work into the character, unlike how he handled the other eight main roles and even most of the supporting roles.All the technical components of the film were absolutely fantastic. Everything from the cinematography and editing to the art direction and costumes were first rate. The totality of all these aspects is what makes Stagecoach such an enduring classic, I think. It doesn't just do one or two things well; it does everything at a high level. The score was especially well done and added nicely to the film, rather than distracting from it like some scores do. The music was used expertly to underscore intense or romantic or comedic moments, but never was overbearing. In fact, the score was so good that it won an Academy Award.Stagecoach is certainly one of the best westerns I've seen and the American Film Institute agrees, ranking it as the #9 western film of all-time, a distinct honor considering all the films in contention.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach (1939)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I love western films and was so excited to learn that we were watching one in class.This film is about a group of individuals who are traveling together to another territory in a small stagecoach. They rush to cross the state lines to avoid running into unwanted guests.During the film you learn that a baby is on the way, which was shocking to me, because I never realized one of the woman aboard the stagecoach was pregnant. Soon after, a gun fight breaks out among the Apache Indians and everyone aboard. However in the end the stagecoach finally makes it to its destination.I loved the acting done by all in this movie, especially the stagecoach driver and doctor. They were exceptionally funny and having them in the film made the film more interesting to watch.I can't say this was one of my favorite John Wayne films, but it was well directed and the casting was right on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Western authenticity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Stagecoach' (1939) is a Western directed by John Ford, and starred John Wayne in one of his first signature roles as a cowboy hero. The movie is set in the Southwestern USA during the late 1800's. The region is still wild, and cavalry troops protect the frontier from warring Native Americans. The story opens as an eclectic group of travelers are preparing to board a stagecoach in Tonto that is bound for Lordsburg. With the journey passing through hostile territory, the local Marshall decides to ride shotgun, while a small band of cavalry troops accompany the stagecoach partway. In the first few scenes, we learn of the plight of each traveler and their unique reason for taking passage ? the prostitute that was run out of town, the physician who has become a drunkard, the young bride looking to meet her husband, and the whiskey salesman. On the outskirts of Tonto, a corrupt banker and a gambler join the ensemble as they begin their drive towards Lordsburg. Out on the trail, the stagecoach travelers meet up with the fugitive, The Ringo Kid (John Wayne). Now all of the characters in the story are present, and their adventure begins.John Ford's western was a difficult sell to the major studios ? the theme was considered passé, and John Wayne was a minor actor. However, Ford was able to obtain funding and United Artists distributed the film. 'Stagecoach' was nominated for seven academy awards, with several lauding the film for design elements ? editing, art direction, and cinematography. Most of the movie was shot on location, using Arizona's Monument Valley as the backdrop. The sweeping landscape shots, the dusty stagecoach trails, and the battle with Native Americans added much authenticity to the movie. While the story line was simple, Ford reinvigorated the Western style movie for the American audiences through this film. With a run time of 96 minutes, the cinematography and editing makes 'Stagecoach' a film worth viewing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's First Sound Era Oater</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's immortal western classic "Stagecoach" made a movie star out of John Wayne. Ford and Wayne began a long collaboration with this Ernst Haycox inspired oater and made several memorable westerns, among them "Fort Apache," "Rio Grande," "She Wore A Yellow Ribbon," "The Horse Soldiers," and "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance." When you watch this stark but impressionable horse opera, the first thing that you notice is the ensemble cast. John Wayne's Ringo Kid isn't the only character in "Stagecoach"; he is surrounded by other strong characters. One of the strongest characters is a drunken doctor; Thomas Mitchell played this role so well that he received an Oscar for his performance. The Dudley Nichols screenplay concerns the passage of a stagecoach through Indian infested terrain when Geronimo is on the warpath. Each passenger is a character. Doc Boone is being run out of Tonto by his landlady, while a prostitute Dallas is being escorted to the coach with a group of prudish women. A banker is leaving town because he has to attend a meeting out of town; in reality, the pompous banker is fleeing because his books are not balanced. Finally, after they leave town, the coach comes across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) who has broken out of prison to kill Luke Plummer (Tim Tyler) and his two brothers who murdered the Kid's father. "Stagecoach" is about relationships. The Ringo Kid cannot take his eyes off Dallas. Laan Curly cannot take his eyes off Ringo. A genteel Southern gambler in a white hat named Hatfield is drawn to protect Mrs. Mallory while she awaits the return of her cavalry officer husband. Doc Boone buddies up to a whiskey drummer. In effect, the stagecoach becomes a microcosm of society. The scene where the Apaches pursue the stagecoach across a dry lake is exciting stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>How the 'Western' was born.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 was probably the best year for cinephiles of all generations. From the world of film critics to frequent movie-goers to people whose favorite pastime is watching movies, it's a memorable year with Victor Fleming's colorful romantic epic set during the Civil War, "Gone with the Wind", and the movie that made fantasies realities, "Wizard of Oz"; William Wyler's "Wuthering heights"; Frank Capra's "Mr.Smith Goes to Washington"; Billy Wilder's "Ninotchka"; and many more releases.John Ford bolstered his stature as one of the most revered directors with this film that gave birth to a new genre in movie-making. The movie may be too slow and boring to those accustomed to the colorful spaghetti western flicks where a gunslinging man with no identity maintains balance in the town he visits. The movie was probably one of the first few movies with on-the-move action sequences that has one bunch of people firing at the other and vice-versa, on a stagecoach that is far behind its destination.Ford's "Stagecoach" has a group of travelers from different walks of life, disparate in every sense, but think better of each other as they travel through the "no man's land", the West.An inebriated Doc Boone fetched Thomas Mitchell a well-deserved Academy award. A wonderful classic from a great director.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am not particularly a huge fan of western films, but I found this film to be interesting and able to hold my attention. It's setting is mostly inside the stagecoach, though a few scenes are outside of it as well. All of the people in the stagecoach are very different, which makes it so interesting to see them interact with one another. Some of the characters you get to know more about then others, but it's amazing that the director, John Ford, was able to give you a little information about all nine characters in this film. The one scene I found to be a little cheesy was when they were being chased by Native American's towards the end. The whole gun fighting and what not didn't really match up and seemed a little unrealistic to me. All in all though, for a western film, it was very good.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If hell is other people (as one of Sartre's characters said in No Exit), one level of hell is certainly other people on a stagecoach careening through a dusty stretch of desert where lurks an army of angry Apaches. Stagecoach is a classic and for good reason. A bunch of strangers, each with their own murky and complex motivations, are jostling around on the stagecoach trip from hell.The beauty of it all is that each person, more or less, has their polar opposite along for the ride. There's the morally upright and pregnant wife of a cavalry officer off to rejoin her husband, and her antithesis, a "fallen" lady ready to end her ways of harlotry; but will society let her? There's a drunken, flamboyant, disgraced doctor ? beloved, but run out of town for his incompetence, and his opposite, a meek, mild mannered, easily forgettable whiskey peddler. There's a ramrod straight sheriff who can't see fit to bend the law, and his counterpart ? Ringo Kid (John Wayne showing why he would become a star) who has escaped from prison to avenge a wrongful death and is a criminal, even though he has justice on his side. Rounding out the motley crew, a smooth gambler with impure intentions, an embezzler and Andy Devine as the stage driver, bringing his peculiar voice and comic relief to tie it all together. And it works beautifully.This was 1939 and director John Ford was pulling together what would become standards in movie language ? the hooker with a heart of gold, the against all odds love story, etc. It may seem trite now, but it was likely revolutionary in those days. The natives, sadly, were basically cardboard cutout characters, and it seems many horses suffered in the climatic running gun battle, but fans of westerns should see this.And there's one more character worth mentioning ? the landscape. Much of Stagecoach was filmed in Monument Valley and even though their linear trip inexplicably circles past the same buttes repeatedly, the back drop is amazing. It must have been a revelation in those days when seeing that part of the county was less straightforward than clicking on the internet. We had the good fortune of staying at The View hotel overlooking Monument Valley (go there if you can) and the buttes and mesas featured in the film. We hiked the only trail into the now-protected land circling around one of the most familiar outcrops (bring water!) and the movie was even more enjoyable as we saw them traversing the same country we walked through.--www.cowboyandvampire.com --</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" set the stage for most westerns after 1939. Why? Because John Wayne was in most of them. This was the breakthrough performance of the actor and it definitely did not fail to impress. The mix of humor, action, and morals in this film is blended well with the help of an eccentric doctor and a wide variety of characters ranging from a whiskey salesman to a prostitute who give classic comic relief amidst the serious backdrop of native-American attacks, a pregnant passenger, and an escaped convict's presence. The climax of the film has one of the earliest and most spectacular gun fight scenes with John Wayne laying atop a speeding stagecoach with his rifle fending off hordes of Indians on horses. Any fan of the Cowboys and Indian genre will find a must-see in "Stagecoach".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach can easily be considered a template for most western movies. Although there were westerns before it, this movie set the bar incorporating a cavalcade of different characters, and beautiful scenery. Stagecoach is a truly entertaining film. John Wayne steals every scene he is in, and his entrance is legendary in every way. The incredible, sweeping landscapes are contrasted (sometimes enigmatically) by the confined stagecoach. Despite all of the wide open space, the characters are forced to stay close to each other, for better or worse. The film really has good balance, each character is important and developed, there is great pacing between the action and the buildup, and there is even a hint of romance that really seems natural. All of this coupled with a wonderful shoot-out at the end really makes this film special.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Old Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach, 1939 Before I saw this film, I was told that director Orson Welles (Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, duh) saw this movie forty some-odd times during his creation of his masterpiece Citizen Kane because he argued that it was a "perfect textbook of filmmaking." So, I really had high expectations for this...And I wasn't necessarily disappointed, because I did like certain aspects of the film, including the cinematography of the old Western Frontier, the acting, Ford's direction, and pieces of the pretty traditional outlaw story. But the ending ruined it for me...I was just left with asking myself, "It ended like that?" Not necessarily like it ended badly, but personally I didn't like it. I thought it was a bad direction to take the final, say, 15 minutes. Because for the original bulk of the film, it went rather fast paced and it was very interesting and enjoyable, but the ended was so slow. If you're in to watching all the old classic Westerns, check this out.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" has to be one of the great first westerns. Just the mix of so many types of characters traveling together leads to so many different views on how they should handle the obstacles that they come across. You learn that sometimes the bad guys aren't necessarily bad and you never know who the good guy is really. The passengers of the stagecoach go through so many different trials together that bring some of them closer together but others farther apart at points until eventually they learn that they all need to work together. I used to love watching westerns growing up with my grandfather and its nice to see where they all came from and were based off of. The director John Ford did an incredible job showing some of the different history of the characters but leaving out others that weren't necessarily needed to tell the story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was pure visual excellence. A visionary and influential presentation of the wild west, impressive in its scope and grandeur. Some really beautiful photographs in this one really transported me to that time.The slow camera pan as it followed the horse-drawn wagon galloping across the ever-wide expanse of desert hills and shrubbed dusty plains midst a never-ending backdrop of bright clouds in the thousands hanging softly and serenely was gorgeous. I think John Ford was one of the first to cinematically and photographically realize the potential of the so- called Western setting. The actors mixed well together, each one with his or her own unique personality adding to the whole, it was highly entertaining, the drunken doctor and silly stagecoach driver being my favorites. Of course the film is also chock full of racism, misogynistic undertones, homophobia and especially worst of all the lack of respect for Native Americans. It's embarrassing and somewhat distracting if not repulsive but like most are quick to say it was a part of that period. John Wayne was John Wayne and I praise him for that he created a new style, the way he looks at people is timeless and all throughout the movie he exudes pure manliness and lust.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a film about a group of people attempting to make the journey form one town to another. On this coach there is a thoughtful sheriff, a drunken doctor, a kind prostitute, a chivalrous gambler, an anxious whiskey seller, a runaway bank manager, a southern girl, a notorious outlaw, and a worrisome driver. The whole stagecoach is venturing to Lordsburg, however the only way takes them through hostile apache territory. Patiences are tested and friendships are formed. This film is definitely one of John Wayne's better westerns. He does a superb job with his character. I don't enjoy many westerns however I found this one entertaining, much better than some of John Wayne's older films. I give this film a 7 out of 10 because I thought it was an enjoyable western that wasn't too cliché.</fullReview>

Even though he escaped jail he was still a really content man and kept everyone in the car calm together. I also really liked the Character Doc. Even though he was a drunk he still thinks about other people, he is not selfish. Also the camera is great in this movie, the low angle shots throughout the movie are amazing for 1939.

		<fullReview>I had to watch Stagecoach for a class I am taking in college, and it was one of the few in which I liked the acting/plot and the technical elements equally. The plot is very interesting, which is saying a lot because I'm normally not all that interested in westerns. I find the characters very likable--interestingly enough, I think that Dallas and Ringo, the two criminals, are actually the most round and likable characters. Technically the movie has many interesting elements, including a lot of shots of the horses/coach riding through the desert, which I always find really great because I like seeing a lot of scenery. It sets the mood wonderfully and really helps to make everything feel authentic. I also liked the shots inside the coach itself just because they really illustrate that cramped feeling you get when traveling a very long distance with many other people very well. In my opinion, that feeling alone makes the movie great. The idea that it can really make you FEEL something is just incredible, especially for a movie in a genre I usually quite dislike.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In one of my previous reviews, I said that Rio Bravo was the best John Wayne movie in my opinion. I've just always thought that it held up the best over the years with its engaging story, great characters, and genuine suspense. But now, my previous statement is being tested, because I've just been reminded what an amazing classic Stagecoach is. I saw this movie when I was a kid, and always seemed to dismiss it amongst other John Wayne movies. It was probably because it was in black and white (I watched a lot of black and white films when I was a kid, but I still preferred John Wayne's colored films) and most of it was dialogue. It wasn't until I was older that I realized how great a movie this is. As a kid, I was very big into action, but now as an adult, I'm much more into good characters and good writing. And that's what Stagecoach is all about. We spend so much time with these characters, and the writing is so good that you feel like you're there with them. Now this movie is very light on action, but I think that's what makes it stick out from other westerns. It's not about revenge, it's not about saving the girl, and it's not about protecting a small town. It's about the characters we meet, and how the journey they take changes them. The characters we're given are unforgettable. Some may be more flat than others, but the whole cast is just great. I've always loved movies that put character and writing in front of everything else. One of my favorite films of all time is 12 Angry Men, because even though it's non-stop dialogue and takes place in one room for an hour and a half, it has great memorable characters, great writing, and it's great watching these characters work of each other. And that's what makes Stagecoach so great; the interactions between the characters. You got funny characters, serious characters, nice characters, mean characters, over the top characters, and mysterious characters. These characters are all completely different, and that's what keeps it interesting. The whole cast is great, but it's the young John Wayne who steals the show. He just has this presence to him, and you can see why he's one of the greatest movie stars of all time. Now like many classic films, the only flaws in the film are the ones that are just a product of their time. One thing I can't stand is when people watch a classic movie, and take offense to every little out dated thing. Yes, the women faint and ride off with the man, the Mexican characters eat nothing but beans, and the Native Americans are bloodthirsty savages. But it was the 1930s, what do you expect? America just got over the Great Depression and there was a war overseas. Movies like this were made to boost the spirits of the American people. It was a dark time, and the people wanted to see a brave American hero rise up against their oldest enemy, which at the time were the Native Americans. Yes, today these things seem very outdated and offensive, but it's what the people needed. If you want to whine and complain about every "product of the time" moment, and make an argument about why today's racism is so much better than the racism of yesteryear, then go right ahead. But if you can appreciate the film for the time it was made, and realize how important it was to audiences, then you truly know what cinema is all about. Stagecoach is one of the Golden Age classics; don't let the dated elements blind you from how great this movie really is.</fullReview>

These characters are shown over over again in western films and shows. The Hooker, the businessman, the drunk guy, the doctor,the gun slinger, the uptight girl and the con-man. In the film though there are some genuine points. Like when they see the baby, it's true everyone reacts the same to a new baby. I love love love the action. To get a horse to fall is very hard to accomplish. Unrealistic yes, but classic none the less. I lover that they tried to have a back story for Ringo and make him have some depth but I don't think it worked. I'm not normally a John Wayne fan but I do think he is less of a cartoon character in this film then in any other one I've seen him in. I mean, except maybe True Grit.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This western was the first I've watched in my lifetime, it was cool how the movie was setup. The characters all had to sit in this stage coach together. All these different characters have very different personalities which gave the story a bit of humor. With that being said, whenever a predicament came about, each character wanted to settle it there own way which caused even more problems. But by the end of the movie, they all seem to have a stronger friendship. It's very realistic because when one goes through a bad experience with someone they've never met, they have to work together to get through it, which gives those a sort of morality they may never have had with someone else before. It's a great lesson, when a big problem such as the one in the movie, Native American's out to kill, they must work together to get to their destination safely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was my first "western" movie, and honestly it was much better than I expected. It was a little dry and boring at times, but overall I would recommend it to someone who enjoys a western love story. Love stories happen to be my favorite genre, so needless to say I loved following the story of Dallas and Ringo. Despite everyone else's opinion of the prostitute Dallas, Ringo saw her for who she really was and didn't let other opinions effect his perception of her. For me that was the main story in the movie, but there were also many other important stories going on as well. I liked this aspect of the movie. Every character had their own purpose, and perused what they were after. It was all very convincing, except for the Indian fighting scene. There were about 50 Indians shooting arrows and guns at every angle and yet the stagecoach barely got hit, meanwhile Ringo, Buck, and Curley had no problem hitting an Indian every time. Besides this unrealistic scene the film was very entertaining; there were very few negative characteristics.</fullReview>

The story line was pretty basic nothing really exciting, but the characters had a well balanced amount of seriousness and humor that made it interesting to watch. I thought that Claire Trevor (Dallas) did a phenomenal job, she played her part so well that her character was believable. When "Dallas" had troubles Trevor did an excellent job of expressing the struggle of being the better person! I loved the interaction between her and John Wayne, I thought they had quite a bit of chemistry. For a typical western I thought it was pretty good, it was funny and sweet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought this movie was good, it was better then I expected a western movie to be like. I think that the variety of characters used really added a humor sense to the movie, but still showed a seriousness. I liked how the music was tied in as they walked, each step they took the music seemed to be right on key and the camera was in front of them following them each step they took as they walked towards the cart. It almost seemed as though the characters steps were slowed down to make it look as though it was slow motion to show that they were off on a long journey. The lighting seemed to be high key, the backgrounds were really dark and the faces were brightened with light. I think the lighting was different at times, I think that sometimes they used high key lighting and other times it seemed to be low key because of the harsh shadows shown. As Dallas was walking down a long hall way to a lightened door, the path is almost completely overexposed with white lighting and then her shadow is super black. It is trying to show some scenes as dramatic. I loved the scene where they were fighting with the Indian's that were on horses, I liked that they did not keep it at one consistent shot. They mixed up the different angles to show the scene as more of a dramatic one.For example they had one perspective were the camera was at the horses feet showing them running towards us, but they show them getting closer and closer to us.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic western hit</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach can be definitely called a unique and unconventional film in the western genre. It's not concentrated on gunfights, robberies or any other stereotypical aspects of a classic in this type. Along with its fast pace and great storyline it is able to provide a deep and thorough analysis of all the characters sitting in the titular stagecoach running through the Wild West. It certainly is a mastery of its kind by the director John Ford, who made so many fantastic westerns in his career. However, this, very early, film merges entertaining action sequences and psychological insight to produce a picture so great that it should be the one we think about when we think about westerns. It is also the first of many collaborations between John Ford and John Wayne. He plays the famous gunslinger Ringo Kid, possibly the most unwanted passenger here. Even though he is the biggest star of this film his performance doesn't outshine any of the other characters', due to the fact the viewer is able to observe each and every one of them separately during their ride in the far country.Inside the stagecoach we find many, totally different personalities, who embark on a journey that will definitely become the greatest adventure of their lives. Even though at first they don't trust one another, in the process they have to fight together in order to overcome various obstacles and the murderous threat of Geronimo. In order to get to the final destination they need to put all differences aside.In the only, but very impressive, fast action scene of the great Indian chase we ultimately see a clash of all those individualities, as they help each other to survive this deadly onslaught.Because of the fact that the movie takes place mostly inside the cramped stagecoach it gives a claustrophobic feel. The viewer can place himself as one of the passengers and get a glimpse of the mysterious stares given by everyone around. It's hard to be locked for such a long time with a group of strange and not-so-friendly personalities, and that's the general impression this movie makes.Here we have a really fantastic ensemble of actors in the roles, which made them famous in the industry. Andy Devine as the high-pitched and always scared coach driver is probably the funniest person from the bunch. There is Thomas Mitchell as the doctor, who needs to have a drink every once in a while from his precious whiskey hip flask. Claire Trevor as a woman of high class, but also respectively huge ignorance towards others, which makes her unlikeable at first.It's probably one of the most interesting takes on humans as individuals, and at the same time as a unity, ever made. It's a classic western hit, but its structural sense and style is totally different and that's what makes it such a valuable movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As a kid, I never really understood the draw of the western. I just remember wild Indians charging across a field yelping and waving weapons in the air. Guess what this movie has in it?Fortunately, I get it now. I just didn't see the potential for adventure and excitement before. This is a good movie. Filmed very well with breath-taking views of the American south west.You cast of characters is a bit trite, and the actors that play them are not much better. I don't think it detracts much from the experience of the film though. All of the characters were surprisingly layered, and as this stagecoach ride proceeded, so did the development of each character.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a classic western. This film actually got me into some other western. I enjoyed the classic close-ups of John Wayne some classic shots of him. The film work for it's time was good. The plot and characters were amusing and kept the storyline going. There was a diverse group of round and flat characters. The on location shot was one of the first and used in the 30's and started a trend that continued for the future of films. There is also a great shot the the stagecoach during the chase from the Indians of the horses that is amazing. To get a feel of westerns this is a great starting point to see the blueprint of westerns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really dislike western movies, but the only one that I enjoyed watching was The Good The Bad and The Ugly with Clint Eastwood.In this movie you had some flat charters that made the movie boring at first then throughout the movie they make it come together. It was kind of weird how this movie took place on a stage coach. You would think what can go on in a movie in 96mins on a stagecoach. A lot that I did not expect, this movie also had some dynamic characters, which was the main characters of the movie. Making it a little more entertaining to watch. I love the end of the movie when Ringo escape with Dallas. That was like the typical ending of most old time movies. John Ford did a great job in putting this movie together, it was pretty OK.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best of the Wild West In My Opinion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most Wild West movies that are made often come out a little short, even though they have enough action to impress the masses. This movie, however, doesn't come short in every instance. Every character that roll through this movie are actually the opposite of what they seem to be. This movie is the perfect example of showing round and flat characters. The round characters would be Ringo and Doc Boone and the flat characters would be Hatfield and Buck. The former two have a change in their ways and the drunk Boone even gets to shiny in the movie. The latter two have no absolute changes and the they are extremely predictable. This movie is grand and any who says otherwise is missing out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film really had the true meaning of the wild west! One of these reasons could be because they did a lot of location shooting and the characters took on the roles of people of that time.No one does this better than John Wayne, the cowboy of all cowboys! He really takes on each character he plays very well, it also helped that he was probably in a hundred wild west movies. Anyway the shots they used during the scene when the Indians are attacking the stagecoach, during this scene they use a lot of close ups on the people shooting back and forth but also lots of wild angle shots creating a more intense scene. They make the scene more intense by showing the Indian's coming into the frame more and more as the scene continues, giving the illusion that they are going to kill all of them. Over all this movie was awesome, though I might be bias because i'm a big fan of John Wayne!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Puts a twist on the classic western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach puts a twist on the classic western film. First of all, this film being in black and white gives its western feel a huge advantage. Without the black and white old-timey look, it just wouldn't be the same. The rebellious mood of this film gets its audience gripped. When the wagon crew first set out, it is unknown just how much of an adventure they're going to have. When the wagon picks up the outlaw who recently escaped from jail (Ringo), it paves the way for an action packed flick. As they travel, they become more and more aware of the trouble they will face with the Apache Indians. Although this film is mostly serious and adventurous, the relationship between Mr. Peacock and Dr. Boone gives the intensity a huge comedy relief. Their interactions with each other bring the audience to hysterical laughter. This brings us to the not-so-ironic but ever-important relationship between an outlaw (Ringo) and a prostitute (Dallas) which brings the adventurous film a romantic factor. This film has many different sides, with its amazing photography, classic cowboys and Indians scenes, and fast chases and shootouts. Stagecoach is a film packed with drama, action and humor.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is one of many black and white films that just wouldn't be the same in color. I feel as if the black and white really brings out the contrast in the background and the main character or view point. With many of these shots film on location, you get the amazing sunlight and actual picture of the American Western lifestyle. What i enjoyed most about this film was the amount and variety of well played characters. Each one was played to perfection and held a strong role in the film. Whether it was a round character or even a flat one, they all reflected off of the main plot of the story. The idea of the social ranking was often brought up in the film and but to an extent that almost felt normal. It just goes to show you how often people in society judge a book by its cover, even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film is not by any stretch your average Western. Although the plot may follow the typical 'lone cowboy saves the day' format the overall smoothness of the story and the incredible flow that it has throughout kept me much more tuned in than I would normally be for a Western.I found the humor in this movie to be very well done. The doctors drunken antics never failed to make me laugh and the overall sarcastic form of humor the movie had was right up my ally.The main characters equal regard for everyone and his tendency to treat everyone with kindness and respect was truly moving in the film. When he spoke to someone he didn't speak as if he was speaking to a gambler, or a prostitute but instead spoke as if he was speaking to a person which I feel reflects the underlying theme of the movie.On the surface the film is your classic Western but if you look a little deeper you find that the film has a very socially critical message. Everyone is equal and should be treated as such. The harsh judgments placed on the prostitute by the travelers in the beginning illustrate this perfectly. Later on in the film we find that she is not a bad person at all but rather, is very sweet and caring.An awesome, socially critical, well put together masterpiece. Well worth a watch or two!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Panoramic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An interesting movie set in the old west, but not really what I have come to expect from a Western. Even though the traditional gun-toting outlaw bent on revenge, a shootout, and a small town sheriff were present, this was ancillary to the real plot: people, like books, should not be judged on surface appearances.The cinematography is artful with the memorable zoom shot of John Wayne and the panoramic exterior shots of Monument Valley which provide an air of exquisite and expansive isolation between fragile, "civilized" human settlements traversed by a tiny, intrusive stagecoach. Those great exterior shots mostly make up for some of the traveling scenes which are obviously shot against a projected background.While some of the situations seem to be a bit unlikely (Dallas and The Ringo Kid deciding to marry so soon after meeting for example), the writing and actors do an admirable job of driving the plot forward in an entertaining manner.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film takes place in the Wild West which was unpredictable in dangerous. The story follows a stagecoach through remote, unsettled parts of the western United States which is Native American territory, Throughout the film the main characters are trying to stay away from Natives and to plan a way to travel safely. The characters in the story all have complicated, intertwined stories behind them which directly affect their actions throughout. The main message in the movie is to not judge a book by it's cover. This is illustrated a few ways throughout the movie but most notably when dealing with John Wayne's outlaw character. The film includes beautiful scenes of Monument Valley shot on location. Excellent camera work and acting throughout the entire confrontation with the Natives.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Left a great first impression of westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I honestly have never watched a western before, at least not in its entirety. Watching Stagecoach, however, gave me a wonderful impression of the classic western. The concept of several different kinds of people with different backgrounds, professions, and personalities all sharing a stagecoach seems like a kind of early reality TV show setup. This was very entertaining to watch them interact with one another, and to team up to make it from town to town. The only complaint that I would have about the movie was that it was kind of difficult to follow around the beginning. It was difficult to tell what was going on, and Geronimo was mentioned as if he were to become an important part of the storyline, but he never materializes again. Other than that, this was a lovely film, full of action, and that was certainly able to hold my interest.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was a thrill to watch and definitely worth a watch. It has all of the aspects that you want in an old western film. It just has a rustic feel, and it's in black and white which; frankly, every western should be shot in. It's got guns, prostitutes, alcohol, all the tools needed for a fun movie. The action shots and all of the photography was excellent, the photographer was able to catch some great angles and views of the scene that gave you a great perspective of what was going on in the film. The sound was great as well, the guns and all of the sounds were realistic and with no delay. The only complaint is that some points of the film were very dark, mostly inside the actual stage coach; but it's not dark enough to where it ruins the film, it was just darker then I would've have it. The acting was great, John Wayne played a great "bad guy", Ringo, and Claire Trevor played her part as Dallas exceptionally. Overall I rated the film an 8 out of 10 and I advise people to see it if you like Westerns! This is definitely comparable to Westerns released nowadays; if not, better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A surrealistic vision on the pioneers of the West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of course the film Stagecoach is a classic. Writing yet another review is only of value, if you make a connection to your own perceptions. Many decades ago the film Stagecoach made a deep impression on me, even more than its reputation justifies. As a child I had read all the cowboy and western stories of Karl May, a German author of adventure books. May was a fantast and had never been in America, but his books were extremely liked in Europe. In his adventures there was never any doubt about good and bad, and in the end the good always prevailed (sometimes after a struggle of decades). It is apparent why for me, after such an early education, the film Stagecoach fell on fruitful grounds. For years John Wayne became my greatest hero and example, and his deeds seemed to be the obvious answer to many problems. Time has passed, and my interest in western movies withered. How do you revalue an artefact, that shaped your youth? The cover of my DVD version describes Stagecoach as a journey of social misfits, and that is probably an accurate summary. Actually it paints a gloomy and incredible picture of the early pioneers in the American West. On closer examination many of the events are very unlikely or even impossible. This degrades the film, since it insults our intelligence. However, my main objection concerns the crooked presentation of human sentiments. For instance doc Boone, a severe alcohol addict whose liver is most likely about to collapse, is portrayed as a witty, proud, capable (when he is sober) and at times courageous man, and a patriot during the civil war. In short, he is essentially good and a hero. Ringo Kid, the other hero, decides to propose to an unknown woman, after a day together in the stagecoach. And the director John Ford admits of no doubt, that this development is in his perception highly romantic. You have to think deep in order to find a even a rudimentary moral lesson here. It makes you wonder about Fords own private life. In one aspect the film Stagecoach differs from the books of Karl May. With May the Indians are noble wild men. With Ford they are just targets, and we will never know why Geronimo organized an uprising in the first place. In conclusion Stagecoach seems to advocate a surrealistic world, that is twisted to the bones.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Best Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not a big Wesern fan but this was a great movie. Seeing it for the first time, you'll enjoy watching the elements that make it great: First, locations. As the stagecoach makes its way, thousand foot high buttes spike out of the terrain. The streets teem with commerce, the interior shots are just as genuine-feeling -- low ceilings of stagecoach stops, the "tattered elegance" of saloons, and dramatic lighting of every interior. Watch for little details of lighting and camera angle to suggest themes or to reveal character. Second, a wonderfully paced mix of theme and plot, the plot being the escape through Apache territory toward lives which may be worse than the ones they left, and in the case of the Ringo Kid (John Wayne) the escape from prison to possible death. Claustrophobic human settings against the grandeur of the wide skies work perfectly for Ford's theme, and the major theme is a dark close one. Hypocrisy, pretentiousness and pettiness devastate the lives of some of the film's characters. Claire Trevor is the prostitute Dallas, and magnificent Thomas Mitchell is the alcoholic doctor, both evicted from the town of Tonto by a sanctimonious committee. This rejection is Ford's commentary on the weaknesses of the American character, just as John Wayne's decency and innate sense of democracy are comments on its strengths. Third, the characterizations and the brilliant performances to make them real. From gambler Hatfield to the little whiskey salesman, their characters all have puzzling pasts, and they interact with one another in ways that lay out their own strengths and weaknesses and themes of American greatness and American pettiness. Andy Devine portrays a decent guy who can't leave a room or hoist himself into the driver's seat without complaining about something or other. He is, along with all the others, magnificent.</fullReview>

The only acting I had seen by John Wayne before this movie was done by people impersonating him. His swag and his way of talking is funny and interesting. I didn't like anyone else in the movie though, especially the really thin guy with the really thin face that died. I didn't enjoy the story that much and got a kick out of how terrible the Native Americans were at their bows and arrows and how amazing a shot John Wayne was with an inaccurate weapon on a moving stagecoach.

		<shortDescription>Great Character Development</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Ford's "Stagecoach" is an excellent film that helped propel John Wayne into the Hollywood legend we remember today. The film tells the story of a group of unlikely travelers as they travel through dangerous Apache territory together. The characters are diverse, well written, and superbly acted. The strength of this film was in the development of deep characters and complex relationships in a relatively short amount of screen time. The dialogue and interaction help you feel for the characters in a very real way. You feel the scorn of the prostitute, the nobility of the gentleman, the aloofness of the drunk, the determination of the sheriff, and most of all the pain and grit of the misunderstood outlaw, Ringo. John Wayne's portrayal of Ringo Kid is undeniably real and heartfelt, and is without a doubt the strength of this film. The story is a good one, if not wholly unique, but the reason "Stagecoach" is a classic is the development of deep, and unforgettable characters, specifically John Wayne's Ringo Kid.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The start of the great John Wayne. He was awesome in Stagecoach, but that's about as good as the movie gets. We meet each of the characters early on in the town, and learn a bit about them as we travel. But that's it. The characters travel on a Stagecoach west, and along the way we learn a bit about each character. We see into their past and their relationships with each other, and how they know each other, but we don't go much deeper than that. The plot is relatively boring, with one interesting subplot with Wayne. The characters travel on the coach and stop for dinner a couple times, which is a nice change in plot but then move on. The Indian chase scene is unrealistic. The only exciting part is the final scene with Wayne killing the brothers who murdered his brother, with the three bullets he saved.Stagecoach was not very interesting, and could easily lose the audience. The only good thing about it was John Wayne and the start of his rise to the top.</fullReview>

I find them to follow the same story line and drag on to no end, but with this film Stagecoach I found myself engaged and wanting to figure what was going to happen next to the passengers. I genially cared about the characters and their well being. I think why I liked the film so much was because of the dialog. The use of dialog between the characters really allowed you to get to know them as a person and not for their stereotype or label. I also enjoyed the comical character of the doctor. He kept a comedic tone throughout the film even when there were pressing matter or events taking place.

So slow that I almost fell asleep before anything happened.The biggest highlight of this movie is the scene with the stagecoach and the natives on horseback. The action in that scene was extremely well done and whoever the man was that dropped down in front of the stagecoach and in between the horses is the bravest stuntman to ever live in my opinion.</fullReview>

His role as Ringo ,the outlaw with a heart of gold who seeks justice for the murder of his family ,released him from being a joke among the film crowd. The cast of characters in this movie is most wonderful. Among the character who partake in the adventure of the stagecoach my favorite is by far the drunken Doctor. The scene were the other men are trying to sober up the Doc by splashing him with water and forcing strong black coffee into him is hysterical because it really shows the age and is a nice comedic break away from the drama of the story.

		<shortDescription>A cactus-filled portrait of the human condition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The idea of watching a western initially, did not seem very appealing but Stagecoach actually turned out to be an incredibly well done film. The characters the film follows each encompass a unique social position or personality, which the actors portray wonderfully. The film's focal concentration is on an alcoholic doctor, prostitute with "a heart of gold" and a cowboy seeking vengeance; they are fleshed out by their counterparts; a cold and pregnant aristocrat, a mysterious love-struck gambler and a nasty banker. It is easy to see why this movie changed the very way westerns were viewed before its release (as cheaply made "B" movies) because everything about it was so "on-point" and tightly presented.As the coach travels through the beautiful rocky desert landscape (impressively enough it was actually shot on location in Monument Valley) the characters interact in the small, cramped space unable to ignore one another and everything we may have thought about the characters is broken down. Their real personalities are revealed. The prostitute is more than just a depraved individual (as movies usually present a lady of the night) but a woman with more warmth and "breeding" than her rich and snobby counterpart. The aforementioned woman ultimately cannot even be troubled to thank the prostitute for saving her infant's life, and watching over her in her time of need. Stagecoach is not just an action-filled saga, but an interesting depiction of the "human condition."</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent Excellent film. Superb, pure and original. John Ford brings us Stagecoach with a whole new look about western films. Location shooting, sound. This movie is considered the first A movie western and for good reason. The cinematography in this movie is so intelligently shot. Outstandingly flexible camera angles, good low light composition and incredible cuts. One of the most interesting shots in this movie is during the battle between the native Americans, An extremely low angle shot, shot subjectively on the ground as we see a horse and Indian ride right over the camera. It was single hand-idly one of the coolest looking shots I've ever seen in film! This movie was amazing to watch from start to finish John Wayne is a classic western character and Stagecoach is a classic film. It's a must see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Just a Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So far this movie has been my favourite to watch in class as it crossed boundaries from an ordinary action-packed Western to a socially stimulating film as it focused on breaking down stereotyping and the social prejudices at the time, while also pushing the limits set by the Code. I thought the cast was really in touch with each of their characters, the expected social standings they were to portray, and how to reveal the person they were beneath these labels, whether for the good or bad. I was surprised at how well each character revealed his or her inner layers and the way it affected the interactions between the group as a whole. It became clear at the end of the film who the "good" and "bad" characters were despite the role in society they played. The same can be said for people in real life and I found this commentary to be very refreshing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gotta love the Westerns</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stage Coach" is definitely one of the better old western movies out there. What made it stand out to me the most was it didn't follow the standard moral "black and white" that was used during the code era of film making. John Ford sent the message that this world isn't just made up of rights and wrongs. Sometimes you may have to do things that you may know aren't right but you do them because you have to get by. "Stage Coach" made the point just because you've done some lousy things in your life that doesn't make you a bad person and sometimes the upstanding member of society is the villain. You going through the movie with a few upstanding citizens on the stage coach and a few shady characters but as you go farther and farther into the film these characters start to round out. You learn this so called terrible outlaw Ringo the Kid is actually a nice guy that's just had a rough life. That Dallas who once sold her body for sex isn't some "defiled whore" and is still suitable for some man to marry (not really how I'd put it but I'm trying to do this from a some what 1939 perspective). You learn Doc Boone isn't just some drunken fool and when he has to can get serious and do his job. The main shocker being that Henry Gatewood the banker (the so called upright citizen) is the real villain trying to steal folks hard earned money. Ford showed Americans that you can't always judge a book by it's cover in this one hell of a Western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was a very classic old "western" movie. My favorite part in the movie was when people were getting shot at and horses were falling over and getting trampled on. It is definitely a classic western movie and lots of little things happened in the back of the car, a man almost killed a lady to put her out of her misery but wound up never doing it and the way the horses ran into the John Wayne with the rifled and he sattled up and hopped on for the ride. John Wayne played a great actor and he was my favorite part of the movie because the whole time he acted like he had no fear. Great movie because of John Wayne in my opinion!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The classic western "Stagecoach" was excellent. I am not a huge western movie fan, but the acting just brought me to love it. The acting played by the doctor and "The Kid" was awesome.I thought it was funny how the doctor always seemed to want some more too drink, but when it came down to it he'd straighten right up and become his doctor figure. I also really liked the lighting in the movie. There was a lot of scenes that would be dark, but behind the main scene would be lit up. I really liked when the character that wants "The Kid" dead, stands up from the card table and they leave his head in darkness, leaving us the viewer wondering who he is. Overall a great western movie, I love John Wayne as an actor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the finest westerns ever made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I admit I am not a huge western fan, but there have been some I have really liked. Stagecoach is no exception, in fact it is a brilliant film not just as a western but of any genre really. Everything about it is wonderful, and I can see why Orson Welles watched this apparently 40 times preparing for Citizen Kane. The cinematography is gorgeous, and as always the Monument Valley locations are magnificent. The music is very well done too, and the story while simple always grips. The script is clever and well written and all the characters are credible. On top of that the big chase sequence for me has to be one of the finest action set pieces for any film. The special thing about these characters are that by the end of the film they aren't as they are initially seen to be. John Ford's direction is superb, and the acting is excellent, not just from John Wayne who gives one of his better performances here but also from the likes of John Carradine. Thomas Mitchell though is the one that steals the show. Overall, a fine film and a benchmark in the western genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Doc, the gambler, the dance hall girl, the liquor salesman, the sheriff, the stage handler, Tim Holt and the pregnant girl all expertly casted around the "Duke". Donald Meek could have received more accolades for his efforts. Now then, the incredible Monument Valley is shot from a dozen angles and with some snow as well! Plummer's death scene was believable and Thomas Mitchell looked to be at times tasting possibly the real thing rather then iced tea! The walk through town on the last night was loaded with authentic extras in the background. The girl who played Plummer's admirer during the card game was lovely and appeared to be deserving of higher casting later in her career. High Noon was great but I can't think of a better western than Stagecoach!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought for one of the first western movies made they did a great job showing how the west was. I thought the charters and scenes really made the movie come together. I also thought that the charters played there role extremely well. They were very put together and made the movie flow and made it more realistic. I also felt that they did a great job keeping you interested in the film by making the plot more drawn out and the way the camera was. The camera was taken long shots and close shots that were both important to make the movie come together and flow smoother. All in all I say the movie was a pretty good and really came together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Great movie. This is a furiously entertaining and exciting movie. John Ford directs the first of many westerns set against the back drop of monument valley. This film transcends the usual western formula and becomes something completely new and fresh. Everything is pitch perfect, cinematography, story, pacing, everything. Some of the acting is a bit ridiculous but it actually works and helps fit the films atmosphere. John Wayne puts on his best...John Wayne. He does what he does best, sure he may not be the strongest actor but he has a strong enough personality to carry himself through the film. You can't imagine the film without Wayne, if you were to see his performance when this film first came out you would have know he was going to be big. So many things happen in this movie, it never lets you go. You are locked in and taken on one hell of a ride. Its just building intensity for an hour and a half, and its so enjoyable and so much fun to watch. I highly recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Seeing this movie's title, I thought I was going to be watching another John Wayne western movie, when in fact I was not doing so. I was actually watching John Wayne's first sound western film and the 1st film from over a decade long absence from film making. The setting of the film was also of significance. It was the 1st time we see the backdrop of the Monument Valley of the Southwest. This same place is used in about seven other films he stars in.One thing that caught my eye when watching the movie was how greatly made the film was. I was used to watching low grade budget western films that had no substance. This film on the other hand, actually showed how the west really was and the themes of the time. Overall, it was one of the best westerns I have ever seen and recommend to others.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a really good movie. The film has an interesting, engaging story, which is believable and entertaining. The movie flows really well from one scene to the next. The acting performances in the film are great. I especially liked John Carradine in the movie. I remembered him from Grapes of Wrath, and I liked his performance in that film as well. I love actors who can believably portray different types of characters, and Carradine's portrayal of a western gambling man in Stagecoach was great. A great deal of the film takes place inside the stagecoach, and sequences in those parts of the movie were really impressive. There were a lot of close up shots and cutting between characters; also, there was a lot of subtle interaction between characters and information was frequently conveyed through facial expression, often without much dialogue. Acting in these scenes was top notch. It's really amazing how the directer was able orchestrate the stagecoach scenes so well. Character interaction integrated with camera work was really impressive throughout the entire movie. Overall the film was really smooth and well made, and I enjoyed it a lot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If plot is a stagecoach, the characters are driving.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A highly character driven film, "Stagecoach" boasts beautiful shots, climactic action, and great comedy. The diverse and colorful range of characters is the obvious focus with such archetypes as a drunk, an outlaw, a sheriff, a gambler, and a prostitute present among others. The characters begin their journey with obvious prejudices and feelings towards one another, but develop and change as they travel and fight together. The drunken Doc Boone and Buck the driver splash comedy throughout the film, while Ringo Kid and Ms. Dallas provide the romance. Ringo Kid shows Ms. Dallas respect and care when no one else does, but Dallas is afraid he will no longer have interest in her once he discovers she is a prostitute. Ms. Dallas shows compassion and care to Lucy Mallory, whose disdain for Dallas grows into respect after Dallas protects her newborn baby. Sheriff Curley also changes his opinion of Ringo, who was to be arrested, but is set free to enjoy a new life with Dallas. The dynamic range of characters and their interactions in different situations provides an interesting and enjoyable experience. The film seemed a bit rushed, leaving certain details undeveloped. But the richness of dialogue, and elegant photography support an otherwise great western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach was directed by john ford. This was not his first western film but it was his first western that used sound. The movie is about a groups journey through the desert with the threat of Indians. I loved the scenery of the desert. It portrayed the vastness of the desert and how alone they were with nobody to rely on for help in an emergency. The members on the stagecoach are very different people from different backgrounds. My favorite character was the doctor. He was very smart and always put a positive outlook on things. He was disliked by many people because of his drinking problem but I think that added a lot to the character. Luckily they were traveling with a doctor because something very unexpected happened that shocked me quite a bit. One women who was trying to reach her husband went into labor. The dresses the women wore were very bulky so there was no way of telling that she was pregnant. The scene when the Indians attacked was very exiting and it got my heart pumping. I did not imagine that the Indians would be carrying guns on horseback. Luckily the army came to their aid just in time and they got away to their destination safely. I liked this movie and would suggest it to my friends.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm not really into old films or Westerns, but this one was surprisingly interesting to me. A bunch of strangers are taking a stagecoach together through the West, despite threats of an Apache attack.It has really great character development. Everyone starts out as some kind of stereotypical Western character, but by the end of the film, almost all of them are changed or revealed as something other than what we thought they were. I thought that was great. It does it very well. They don't just change in a cheesy way, and the audience is sitting there like, "What? That was easy." No, it really made sense that they were enhanced by their shared experience.I completely understand why it is a classic and known as pretty much the best Western ever. It displays the era very truthfully, including the racial tension and the treatment of women. It shows whites vs. Indians. It shows how rich women are treated, vs. how prostitutes are treated. It's a very interesting piece. It takes generic characters and makes them feel original.I am not in a rush to buy this, but I would like to. I think it would make really good studying material for anyone hoping to enter the business. It is a great film and I definitely recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film is the basic Western, a template for everything that followed. In Stagecoach various Western characters board a stagecoach which is besieged by an Indian war party.What might have been a minor Western became a classic by virtue of its firm characterization, restrained writing, exciting climax, the scenery of Monument Valley - and some world-class stunt work by the great Yakima Canutt. Whatever the reasons, the film works. The film was director John Ford's first sound Western.

		<shortDescription>Humanity in the Wild West by John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>1939 was probably the first great year for movies. One of them was a western-a genre once regarded with contempt-that revolutionized the western. To have contempt for John Ford's monumental, action-packed and compassionate "Stagecoach" is like shooting yourself with a shotgun, blindfolded.Post-Civil War, Geromino and his band of Apache warriors terrorize the western part of the United States, giving the Union Army trouble and threatening the welfare of a particular stagecoach and occupants, going from the wholesome but prudish hamlet Tonto (Spanish for "fool") to the upscale but decadent mini-city Lordsburg in the state of Arizona.Among them are chubby, cowardly driver Buck Rickabough (lovable, rusty, whistle-voiced western stock player Andy Devine); dutiful lawman Curley (George Bancroft of "Mr. Deeds Goes To Town"); mysterious gentleman gambler/Confederate vet Hatfield (future horror staple John Carradine); prim Southern belle/Union army wife Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) whose pregnancy seems illegitimate in origin; pompous, crooked banker Gatewood (Berton Churchill), a barrel of hypocritical hot air and a populist cartoon of crooked bankers then (Great Depression) and now (Bernie Madoff); alcoholic but wise sawbones/Union vet Josiah Boone (Thomas Mitchell, who roped an Oscar here), exiled from point A town by a band of moral harpies; polite whiskey salesman Peacock(the suitably-named Donald Meek of "You Can't Take It With You") and socially tortured saloon gal Dallas (sweet, precious future Oscar winner Claire Trevor of "Key Largo"), also exiled for her "sexual immodesty". It's society, and its conflicts, in a buggy.Completing and protecting the group is the Ringo Kid (John Wayne, out of the B-film hole), a prison escapee Curley's after. Ringo wants vengeance for his father and brother, both killed by the Plummer Boys (led by B-western idol Tom Tyler). Mallory's pregnancy, Geromino's menace and Curley's duty are barriers to him, but Ringo's honest love for Dallas, a woman he mistakes for "a lady", keeps him pure and straight, while she's torn, frightened by the truth and enamored by a man who has kindness for her.Working with a tough and tender script by Dudley Nichols (Bringing Up Baby, Ford's first script pal before ex-film critic Frank Nugent) that was based on the short story, "Stage To Lordsburg" by Ernest Haycox, Ford masterfully matures the western by twisting the archetypes (Sam Peckinpah and Sergio Leone sure got the hint) and challenging the expectations attached to them.Though the Hays Code demanded morality and propriety from films at that time, the film's most controversial element is probably Boone's reply to Dallas, who wonders if whether or not to accept Ringo's marriage proposal, since she's not the type of gal a man who'd bring home to see his folks: "Gosh, child, who am I to say what's right or wrong?" Saints are not totally clean and sinners are not totally corrupt here, and the main players band together (well?most of them) to survive against adversity. The cast works, especially Wayne and Trevor, whose roles beat the odds by being in love.The story's backdrop, Monument Valley, is vast and breathing. No wonder Mr. Ford returned here for future projects, with and without Mr. Wayne. The climax action's basic but fearless. Stunts are provided and managed by Mr. Wayne's B-movie chum, Yakima Canutt, who has a talking cameo in the film's starting point."Stagecoach is forever an epic, a lesson in filmmaking (Orson Welles learned how to make "Citizen Kane" from watching this film more than once) and a study of humanity.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Ford's best film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There seems to be a myth that John Wayne's dramatic entrance as the Ringo Kid in the film STAGECOACH immediately catapulted him into the first rank of film stars. That's an exaggeration to say the least. After STAGECOACH Wayne starred in four low budget quickies for Republic Pictures. He got second billing to leading ladies and played the second male lead in a few major studio productions. Ford cast him in THE LONG VOYAGE HOME in a forgettable minor role. In the early '40s he starred in a series of cheap Republic war films. His stock rose later in the war, but not until his excellent turn as cattle baron Tom Dunson in Howard Hawks' RED RIVER (1948) did Wayne garner Ford's respect for his acting.Nevertheless, Wayne is very good as the Ringo Kid determined to pay back the Plummer boys for murdering his family; but Claire Trevor is even better, exuding vulnerability as Ringo's love interest, Dallas, a sympathetic prostitute. Thomas Mitchell (Doc Boone), John Carradine (Hatfield), Donald Meek (Peacock), George Bancroft (Curly), Andy Devine (Buck), and Tom Tyler (Luke Plummer) are likewise fine. So it's a little unfair to view STAGECOACH through the prism of John Wayne's legend status. In its time STAGECOACH was not a John Wayne vehicle but a John Ford film, the first to convey the stark beauty of Monument Valley's desert mesas in high-contrast black-and-white. It was Ford's ingenious camera set-ups that captured those luminescent cloud formations that look like Ansel Adams photos.The work by the stunt crew has never been equaled, but it was Ford who cast Navajo Indians as extras, and added bits such as Indians reloading single-shot breech-loaders while riding at full speed, or the little colt trailing the buckboard when the soldiers evacuate the way station. Such small details pass almost unnoticed, but add significantly to the feeling of authenticity we see in John Ford's best work.Bert Glennon's B&amp;W cinematography is superb, but one suspects Ford had more than a little to do with the noirish lighting, especially in Ringo's showdown with the Plummers, which may have been influenced by George O'Brien's eerie night-walking scenes in Ford's favorite film, F. W. Murnau's SUNRISE. Ford certainly chose the parlor tunes and folk songs that make up the Oscar-winning score, which resembles many of the compilation scores in his later films.This film is a landmark western that wasn't the morality tale audiences were used to, but dealt dramatically and realistically with Depression Era themes that resonated with 1930s audiences: a girl who is decent and kind, forced by circumstances into prostitution; an aristocratic southern Belle - one of society's paragons - who is a snob; and of course the banker, a pillar of the community who is really a thief. There are many films that make use of archetypes to tell a story, but very few like this one that invented and defined them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a pretty good movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty good film, even at it's age. Nice plotting, there was real character development, good direction, and good acting. John Ford sure did like Monument Valley, even though it doesn't really look like anywhere else in the West. The time is set set at some time before 1887, since Geronimo was captured then. I have always been interested in how Hays Office-era films treated adult subjects. As a kid I saw that Western towns had "saloon girls" but no other real reference was made about them. Claire Trevor's character, Dallas, was apparently a prostitute, and was run out of town at the beginning of the film. If I had seen this in the 1960's I would have wondered why all those people disliked her. I suppose that nowadays all ten-year-olds know about prostitution, but I was fairly innocent of that. Interestingly, John Wayne's character was said to have been in the penitentiary since age 17 to explain his naiveté about it, since he appeared to be in his late twenties or so. Did they have penitentiaries in the 1870's in the West? Anyway this is still a pretty good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As someone who is not a big fan of films that fall into the western genre, I can honestly say that I really enjoyed this film. The combination of the different personalities and use of suspense during the film was great. Each character represented different things causing the film to have multiple layers to it. For example the doctor and the prostitute are shown being thrown out of the town and the start of the film, therefore they were looked down upon for most of the movie and represented the social outcasts. John Wayne's character and Claire Trevor's characters seemed to be bad individuals because of what they stood for, Wayne being a criminal and Trevor being a prostitute but those two turned out to be the kindest and most caring characters.Foreshadowing is used quite often during the film most notably in the beginning when the passengers are warned of the Native Amercians, this helped to build up the suspense. The closeness inside the stagecoach also added to the tension, not only could the characters not escape one another inside but they had no where to go if they were attacked by the Apaches. The suspense is built all during the movie and the scene in which the passengers are being attacked the camera work is fantastic. Wide shots are used to show just how many Apaches are attacking the small stagecoach while the on screen movement of the horses the actors, and their weapons keeps the viewer on the edge of his or her seat. The combination of the acting the camera-work, and storytelling techniques makes this a great film.</fullReview>

I am not sure where they were going but it seemed like they never went anywhere...maybe I am crazy. I also thought it was funny that the number of Apache Indians never dwindled during the last action scene and that barely anyone in the stagecoach seemed to get injured even though there was nothing protecting them. Other than that, I thought the film was filled with suspense and it even had a little romance to boot. I certainly didn't expect the ending, so that was a nice change.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When individuals are being introduced to one another, the main rule of thumb is to never judge a book by its cover. People that we meet have various personalities, identities, and stereotypes that should be respected by everybody. Most of the time, people aren't always what they seem to be, at first. But once, you get to know them and cooperate with them, they'll be able to accept each other for who they are and not by their stereotype.Stagecoach is an example that uses the golden rule, "never judge a book by its cover" rule to an extreme, throughout the story as all of the main characters are traveling together to find their loved ones, discovering their true selves, and starting out a new life where they'll be able to attain their goal. Traveling to this new place was used as a metaphor for all of these characters to accept each other for who they are, work as a team to save themselves and get a job done, discover something new about themselves and redeem themselves and start a new life with their new identities within themselves. Although a few people's actions are unchanged, people are constantly discovering things about themselves. The director uses this rule and these stereotypes and reverses the thoughts of how at one point, we would see some of these characters as bad people and let us see them doing good things and lets the viewer get rid of that bad stereotype and accept them for good people, especially the main characters.The overall story line and the various plots that were used with all the main characters were developed and used well throughout the fast paced movie that kept you glued and curious about what was going to happen to the characters. The use of the western theme in a real outdoor setting was used well and with the setting, storyline, writing, and costumes made this story more realistic with real life issues that these characters faced in the western life. The acting was performed well throughout the film. The framing in the cinematography was used well with the film as the camera was able to give some scenes a great sense of depth of field and shallow scenes with great lighting to make the scenes more dramatic and adventurous as the viewers were watching the film.Overall, it's a great movie to watch!! With its drama, suspense, adventure, moral lesson, story, and plot, this a great movie that you don't want to miss watching on television or on the internet.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford's vision of the Old West begins here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford, arguably the greatest director of American westerns and one of the finest to ever step behind the camera, began his serious journey as a film maker of high standards and scope with Stagecoach, a perfectly realized ensemble piece that works as both a character study and an action picture depicting the struggle to pioneer the American west.Here, every element comes together and meshes wonderfully beginning with the cast; immaculately picked. Claire Trevor brings a tempestuous and fiery reality to Dallas, the prostitute who is looking simply for some type of acceptance; along with her in that search is the alcoholic doctor Doc Boone in an Oscar-winning performance by one of the best of all character actors, Thomas Mitchell. Of course, the one with the greatest legacy started out here as the one known only as a B-movie actor with seventy-plus credits to his name. With one brisk but famous closeup, Ford introduced his friend and favorite actor as well as the man still today most associated with Westerns: John Wayne. Along with the man he called "Pap," he starts out on a journey that would take them to the Hollywood stratosphere.Still, Stagecoach works as it does mostly because of Ford's direction. Here, he does a masterful job of tying all loose ends together as well as corralling all pieces of the plot into a dense and entertaining story. He also makes incredible use of closeups and mise en scene, techniques only discussed but not truly used at the time. It's no wonder Orson Welles screened this so many times when making Citizen Kane; it is a blueprint for how to create so many different emotions with so many different characters. As for the cinematography, it is gorgeously expansive and breathtaking, even if it is black and white. Today, Ford is respected but also tainted for his portrayal of Indians. That racism is shown here, but so is jealousy, pride, prejudice, and social class differences. All these years later, Westerns still have their way with us and this movie from this director are a big reason why.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this film recently on TV. Despite that it is showing it's age, it is still one of the greatest westerns I've seen to date. The Indian attack, the cavalry to the rescue, the drunken doctor, the bar room floozy with a heart of gold, the gambler, and the hero doing "what a man's got to do" and escaping without a scratch. All the classic and a bit cliché ingredients that makes a classic western but it's done superbly. Not a scene wasted. I highly recommend watching this movie and enjoying a good classic.Its just a fantastic really great western movie, really one of my favourites. I can't understand why anybody wouldn't like this film! Love Westerns you will love this!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid John Wayne western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is an entertaining, fast paced 1939 western film directed by John Ford. It stars John Wayne in a role that put him on the map after years of relative obscurity toiling in Poverty Row movies before Ford insisted on having him play the role of Ringo Kid. Shots filmed in Monument Valley and other location are very impressive. The stunt effects of one scene in particular later in the movie are amazing and must have been terribly risky.While the primary plot is a little thin, it holds its own but thankfully is buttressed by interesting and entertaining secondary characters and sub-plots. The camera work, lighting, and costumes, sets etc. all provide a very realistic impression.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stage Coach, the movie which officially introduced the world to the man who would become a legend in the Western genre of films, John Wayne. Before this, he was considered just not a good actor, overall, because of some of his film role choices. The film, surprisingly to me, didn't start off as slow as other movies from that era. Within ten or fifteen minutes, the party of main characters were already off on an adventure on the titular Stage Coach. From thieves to Geronimo and his gang of Native Americans, the ensemble encounters many other characters during their ride. With occasional comic relief and an awesome and iconic scene near the end, this film really ties these and other factors of the film very well</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In a year that has become known as one of the greatest years in movie making history, Stagecoach, starring John Wayne, has become one of the most classic western films of all time. with the emergence of a star such as John Wayne and a high quality group of supporting actors and actresses, Stagecoach was bound to be a hit for years to come. the movie works great to convey multiple story lines and allows the viewer to feel as if they are out in the desert with the characters. The filmmakers did a tremendous job shooting this movie with a brilliant setting. The amount of effort that went into making this film was worth it for the stunning scenery in the open area of the desert. Also, the movie did not require as much violence and gunslinging that you see in more modern westerns because the movie was able to focus on other aspects. Stagecoach set the precedent for westerns and really upgraded the genre over what was being made at the time</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film that launched John Wayne's career and raised the bar on the American Western, "Stagecoach" is a spectacle and thrilling achievement. Filmed in Monument Valley the vistas are the perfect backdrop for a motley crew of people on a stagecoach traveling through Indian territory. The group of passengers include an alcoholic doctor, a pregnant woman with a chip on her shoulder, a prostitute who has just been thrown out of town for immorality, a gambler from the south, a banker who has just fled with $50,000 that does not belong to him, a whiskey salesman and the one and only Ringo Kid, played by John Wayne. Along the way, prejudices are revealed, a baby is born, people are shot and two people fall in love. For me the best part of the movie was the fantastic chase scene with the Indians and the amazing stunts performed during the chase. Of course there is a lot to be said about the ending. If you love Westerns, and who doesn't, this is a must see film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Now this is a movie, everything about it is superb, the cinematography, the setting, the characters, the script, the execution, everything about it. Even the tale leading up to the eventual creation of this film is even legendary, with John Ford on his "A game" and an amazing crew of technicians, cinematographers, stunt doubles, and a colorful cast of characters including the big time debut of John Wayne, this film has a damn good reputation for itself. It did not disappoint, everything was filmed with a purpose in this film, and with John Ford's experience, the movie was so well recorded that the characters most of the time don't even have to speak to portray what's going on in their minds. A good actor can speak and sound convincing, a great actor can speak and look convincing, a legend doesn't have to speak at all. Some of the greatest character moments are forged through the "well oiled" tactics found in the silent era, conventions that can set up the characters very well, and make them feel much more organic, make them feel alive. A must for any film buff, and a NEED TO SEE for anyone who likes a western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was just great. It had a superb blend of action and comedy that made it fun to watch throughout the whole movie. The characterizations of each of the nine main characters was very well done and each actor put in a good performance in my opinion.John Wayne was the typical western hero doing what a man's got to do and being a gentleman throughout. I was mostly impressed with Claire Trevor's performance. Her reactions to her getting kicked out of town genuinely made me dislike all the women from the Law and Order League. Her response to Wayne's character being nice to her was believable. Thomas Mitchell's performance as Doc Boone was too funny not to mention. His portrayal of a drunken doctor was just hilarious and perfect in every way. I found myself rooting for him to be on the screen more.I believe this movie deserves to be considered as one of the top five western's of all time. I'd put it with, in no particular order, "The Searchers", "High Noon", and both versions of "True Grit".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The camera work in this film was amazing for its time period. I was surprised to see how well every frame was put together. It great to see how the film starts us off by walking down the streets of the western town that was presented. It made you feel as if you were there. And also in the way the camera man/woman had the frame at a angle, it was nice. I believe it was something I haven't seen in the movies that were created before it. The characters are followed throughout the film and it gives you the ability to focus on every movement they may had made. The transitions in each scene is smooth when going place to place. The scene when John Wayne ( main character) is introduced to the audience is so impressive. The way it zooms in on his face, man its just breath taking. My heart literally jumped out of my chest for a second ha. And also the scene when the stagecoach is being attacked by Apache soldiers is impressive as well. It was crazy to see one of the "villain's" jump from a horse onto the horses that drove the stagecoach, so dangerous but epic at the same time. The actor who did that had to be extremely brave. This film was good, I felt it rushed at little when it came to the love story that unfolds in front of us. But then again it worked.</fullReview>

I wouldn't classify this as his best film, but there are many redeeming qualities to the overall film. John Ford, the legendary director, did a great job at leading his cast and crew, and delivered a good film. A certain aspect I loved about the film is how it captured the divide between North and South, by playing on the American Civil War. At the end, despite the plot being wrapped up, I couldn't help but feeling like there was something missing. Don't think that I am bashing this film, because it isn't my intention.

		<fullReview>John Ford was the director of this great film, which starred John Wayne as "The Ringo Kid" and Dallas (Claire Trevor). The Ringo Kid was wrongly accused of a crime, and looks to correct it and avenge the murder of his father and brother. The film takes place in a stagecoach while, the characters were traveling from Tonto to Lordsburg trying to avoid Geronimo and his Apaches on their way. This was a very unusual western because, it was not all about duels and shooting things up. This made the film much more because, you experienced the characters evolving because of the small space in the stagecoach. You could see the love that was forming between The Ringo Kid and Dallas.</fullReview>

He uses camera techniques to further communicate what is happening in the plot. Like camera positioning to emphasize how the characters feel. These formal aspects go mostly unnoticed by the viewer. It is almost like tricking the audience into believing what you want them to. In Stagecoach, Ford examines the grit of the American will. Stagecoach goes much deeper than many westerns.

		<shortDescription>Best Western film I've seen.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is for sure the best "Western" style film I have ever seen. It is set in the wild west during the time of western expansion in America. It is filled with all the same Western stereotypes you would expect; by this I mean it started off in an old dusty town with your typical characters: cowboy's, outlaws and a crew of shady individuals. It is here that the similarities of your typical Western fade away for a bit. John Ford the director focuses the majority of the film on character development as the group of misfits travel through dangerous terrain. The plot is pretty brilliant and camera work is superb.Ford uses unique camera placement and long shots with lots of different motion such as tracking shots and also dolly shots that pull away from an individual to reveal what is around them. This kind of shot can be seen in the scene where they are eating at a table after stopping for food. The camera pulls away beautifully as Lucy moves away from Dallas to reveal the rest of the table and the clear division between the two of them. It's brilliant camera work like this that defines Ford's films and is what has earned him the title of best director. So overall it is a great film for its time and a definite must see for classic film lovers and Western fanatics.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This was an excellent film. It was my first film with John Wayne in it, and even though prior to this film he was a flop, in Stagecoach he did not disappoint. His entrance to the story was so classically western. The rest of the characters were also very well played, I particularly like the gambler with this suave good looks and gentlemanly ways. Even the villainous self-centered banker was a well played character. The story itself is very good as well. A man looking for retribution, a woman running from her past, another woman trying to reach her husband, and a sheriff trying to do the right thing. It has all the trappings of the western tale, even the Mexicans, the riotous Indians and the cavalry coming to the rescue. Throughout their trip the travelers learn to protect themselves and look out for each other against the impending threat of an Apache Indian attack. The directing by Ford was so excellent, focusing on everything and everyone's story, not just a single main character. The scenery was fantastic too, it added so much to the film the fact that it was not a studio set production. The vastness of the west itself almost portrayed it as its own character element.</fullReview>

The group includes a drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a prostitute (Claire Trevor), a pregnant woman (Louise Platt), a gambler (John Carradine), a banker who is carrying stolen money (Berton Churchill), a whiskey salesman (Donald Meek), and a fugitive named the Ringo Kid (John Wayne). A terrific cast directed by one of the all-time greats, John Ford. This classic is the first truly great western, in my opinion. It made an overnight star out of John Wayne. Thomas Mitchell deservedly won an Oscar for his role.Don't let the simplicity of the plot fool you. It's an intelligent story that takes time to get to know each of its characters. There's not as much action as you might expect but when there is action, it's exciting. Ultimately it's a character-driven story that never lags. It's always moving and keeps your interest the whole time. A must-see for everybody.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ford, The Duke &amp; The Coach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some actors find stardom right out of the chute. Some toil for years before making a name for themselves. John Wayne, one of the biggest movie stars of all time, falls into the toil category. He made dozens of pictures (many of them in the silent era) before finally breaking out with a star turn in director John Ford's influential western Stagecoach.The story is rather simple. The Ringo Kid (Wayne) joins an eclectic group of people travelling from Arizona to New Mexico by horse and buggy through Monument Valley in 1880. In a racist shot at Native Americans, Apaches (including superstar Geronimo) are always on the warpath, even gunning for our stagecoach filled with these ordinary people. After the cavalry detachment pulls away its escort, the coach is ripe for Indian attack.Claire Trevor has an important role as Dallas, the prostitute kicked out of the town in Arizona for *horrors* being immoral. Fortunately, she makes a friend in the Ringo Kid. She's also got just as much character as any other person on the stagecoach. Thomas Mitchell won an Oscar for his supporting role as an alcoholic doc. John Carradine also shows up as an enigmatic Southerner.Ford's direction is outstanding as he shoots his first sound western and also sets the story in his beloved Monument Valley. The camera-work and camera placement are wonderful, especially considering how much of this picture was shot on location. Why the film would rank 63rd on the American Film Institute's 1998 Top List and then not make the 2007 version at all is a mystery. Maybe it isn't one of the greatest movies ever made, but it's awfully solid. Just go back in time and ask The Duke. He'd tell you it was one of the most important things to ever happen to him.If this snapshot review tickled your interest, check out the website I share with my wife (www.top100project.com) and go to the "Podcasts" section for our 26-minute Stagecoach 'cast...and many others.

		<fullReview>The film is superbly gripping I must say. A plain story with nine strangers come together in a stagecoach journey. Each character with different motive builds a nice premise. The journey is puzzled by the threat of Apaches. The film grows on its characters as it moves. There aren't much situations but still somehow I felt calm-before-the-storm kind of thrill in the first half. It pursues with romantic affairs and a few funny scenes, until the dynamite finally explodes. The last half an hour of this film is real excitement. The wild chase sequence and shootouts takes the adventure to another level. Especially, John Wayne's shooting on moving stagecoach was one of the most breathtaking moments I have watched. The whole cast was perfect. Claire Trevor really stole the attraction and equally brilliant was Thomas Mitchell playing an alcoholic doctor. It was great to see young John Wayne in action as Ringo Kid, though I admire some of his later screen more. Overall this is totally epic ride in the old west. One of my finest film experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a Western style film produced in 1939. This film was directed by John Ford and it stars John Wayne. This film, common to Western styles, is extremely fast paced. The cinematography is a majority of constantly moving shots. They're are rolling backgrounds which gives the look of a moving stagecoach. During one of the final scenes, in which a battle takes place, the stagecoach is "moving" extremely fast through the desert while engaging in combat with the Apaches. Although the coach isn't really moving on set, the backgrounds are moving which gives the appearance of a fast chase scene that was extremely advanced at this time. Another element that I really enjoyed was the camera cutting out when John Wayne's character Ringo shoots at his enemies, this makes for a really nice suspense camera trick. To match the fast paced cinematography, the music throughout the film is very lively and fast paced as well (this is true for most aspects of such Western style movies) The majority of the music is played by a piano, in one scene however with Mrs. Mallory, the music is slowly played- almost like a lullaby. The acting throughout this is well done. John Wayne is constantly flashing a coy smile paired with a set of calm eyes. This body language to me makes him seem that much more dangerous. Claire Trevor has a constant nervous attitude and always observing eyes. Her acting, next to Wayne's, seems confident yet respectful of his main role. Dallas' character is high spirited yet caring and passionate. This cast of actors/actress' are well suited for their parts and to act with one another. As an example, as Ringo and Dallas embrace towards the end, it is heartfelt and sincere. These two play well together and well off of each other. Although this film is a Western (typically not one of my favorites) I enjoyed it very much. I appreciated the pace of the film, it kept me interested from the beginning to the very end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good, for a Western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For a western(generally I'm not a fan), "Stagecoach" was a decent movie. At times it got a bit confusing because there were so many main characters. It took me until almost the end of the film to get all of the characters names straight. It's easy to see how it started John Wayne's career in major films. His performance as Ringo was, well, what you'd expect from John Wayne. The rest of the cast was fairly interesting as well, John Carradines performance as Hatfield was perfect. The plot itself was good, and it had a couple interesting twists, but it was somewhat generic. I liked the role reversal that occurs within some of the characters, i.e the criminal becoming the hero. The conclusion of the film is fantastic, with justice finally being delivered. Overall, I'd recommend this film to anyone who is interested in seeing a good western, or someone who is unfamiliar with Westerns. This film represents a crowning example of what exactly defines a western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One thing that you notice right away in this film is that where the movie set is shot works. It looks just like you would picture an old western town. I enjoyed how the movies jumps right into it, introducing most all of the main characters, and give us some quick back-round info on each of the Stagechoach passengers. As soon as the stage car leaves town the beautiful landscape in the background jumps right out at you. Really adding to the lawless feeling of the film, you can tell there not as safe as there were in town. The movie just continues to increase that feeling after they drop the troop escort and the Apaches Indians are there biggest concern. The movie soon add's a love story aspect to the film between John Wayne's character and the prostitute. This is depicted perfectly in the shot of the prostitute walking down the dark hall way with John Wayne starring at her. The suspense continues to build through the film. Its ends with a great battle against the Apaches. This fast moving shot is done excellent must have taken hours of film to put together the ten or so minute scene. The final scene has an interesting twist that I did not see coming. Not my favorite John Wayne film but a good one.</fullReview>

In addition, This was the very long trip, and it was quite boring, so I looked forward to when the climax scene was going to happen. However, there was the music which performed during the trip, and there were many beautiful background among the desert that I have never seen. Moreover, when the man interrupted the horse carriage after that the camera zoom to him, I suddenly knew that he was going to be the important character or maybe the main character. Besides, the scene that while people in the horse carriage were drinking water, I thought of while I was drinking water in my car, it was quite hard because of the vibration. Therefore, if that scene wants to be more real, the characters should have shown the act of more harder of drinking water. Finally, the climax scene of fighting was very impressive because there were many scenes of interest. For example, the scene that the Indian jumped from his horse to the carriage horse, and he threw the body down from the carriage horse after he was shot. The scene that the man jumped between the carriage horse to do the control was exciting too. Besides, I really want to know how they can make the scene that they photographed from the ground. Nevertheless, I still do not understand when the Indian people were shot, why they fell from their horse immediately ,or sometimes they were shot;their horse went down before they fell.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film "Stagecoach" from 1939 was the first Western film to truly become popularized. During this period the main genre of films were the Screwball comedy and of course the new Techna color films. Westerns during this time were commonly characterized as 'B' rated films that never really took off. The director John Ford knew in order to make this work he wanted John Wayne and good directing skills and would hope for the best. his theory worked and in turn created a new basis for the western genre. Stagecoach is a movie with action, drama and suspense; 3 main characteristic to make any good movie. It is based on a stagecoach with an array of different social classes and personalities all together with one similar goal; They just wanted to make it safely to their destinations. The passengers were earlier made aware that Jeranamo was planning for an attack, and where they were going was right in the middle of where the Indians were thought to be hiding. John Waynes character Ringo Kid is a wanted man. Along the way he is picked up by the sheriff and forced to travel as a prisoner on the stagecoach. The way the movie is written and brought together with each persons conflicting personalities was genius. It helped to create dynamics in the movie that other wise may never have been expressed. The most irony during the film is when Ringo turns into the saving grace when Geronimo does decide to attack. It is at this point that everyones opinion of each other come to a realization; No matter where they come from or where their lives will lead it is that moment that they're all equal and dependent on one another. Stagecoach is a movie that will be enjoyed by those that like westerns, but still appreciated by those that they don't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>AHHHH another Western!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>So being in the History of Cinema class that I am in, I am introduced to all types of movies. From Silent, to drama, comedies, horror, western,, and musicals. Thus far I have come to find I am not fond of westerns. This particular western I thought was great for the time frame it was created in. The gun fights in it were amazing. There were very few errors I found throughout the film. I felt bad for the adults that had to ride in the carriage because that was a small carriage for 6 adults. I thought it was so smart of Ford to take such a small plot of land and shoot the movie from different directions and angles to make the back round appear much larger than it really was. Such a great use of scenery, you really felt like you were out west with the rest of the cast! I do have to say though, I would get so angry if the man sitting next to me for a few days drank all my liquor and smelt like ti the whole time. Other than that, I wasn't too crazy about this movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Greatest Western Ever?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For me this is one of the finest Westerns ever made, and its also the movie that made John Wayne a star.Wayne is the Ringo Kid a well intentioned but wanted man who ends up on a stagecoach with an interesting group of passengers as they travel through dangerous territory.Wonderfully directed and beautifully shot by John Ford, the film includes some great action sequences. The film also features some interesting and well developed characters with great performances from Wayne, Claire Trevor, Thomas Mitchell, Andy Devine and others.The screenplay is adapted from a short story and was written by noted screenwriters Dudley Nichols and Ben Hecht. According to John Ford the story was also somewhat inspired by a Guy de Maupassant short story.This would be the first Western which Ford would make with sound, the first time he would shoot in the visually stunning Monument Valley, Utah, and his first time directing Wayne.The film won the supporting Oscar for Thomas Mitchell best known as Uncle Billy from It's a Wonderful Life, and was nominated for another 5 Academy Awards including Best Picture.Although this would be the film that made Wayne a star it was far from his first, he had made mostly B westerns and Stagecoach was his 80th film.According to Orson Wells he watched the film more than 40 times while making Citizen Kane.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic Ford, classic Wayne</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" is 70 years old and is compelling today as it was when it was first released. Directed by John Ford, with John Wayne in his star-making role, it's the story of people riding in a stagecoach through Apache country. Ford shot "Stagecoach" on location in Monument Valley, the first of many times not only he, but Wayne, would make films there. I rode the "Stagecoach" trail some years ago - it's hot, dusty, with the magnificent formations in the background. And it's a bumpy ride.There are many elements that come together to make this film great. The first is the striking group of characters: a prostitute (Claire Trevor), a drunken doctor (Thomas Mitchell), a gambler (John Carradine), a Virginia woman trying to get to her soldier husband (Louise Platt), a liquor salesman (Donald Meek), a skittish stagecoach driver (Andy Devine), etc. Most impressive is the accurate depiction of the mores of the time: It was considered unladylike and distasteful to a woman to speak of her pregnancy; ladies did not consort with prostitutes. These standards worked in the east, but once you got into the wild west, you were either together or you were dead.The second thing that makes this movie great is the way it was shot - Ford has a marvelous cinematic sensibility - he has large panoramas where the stagecoach looks very tiny against the vastness of Monument Valley, and one wonders how they could ever make it through. One feels the heat, the dust, the wind, and the bumps.The third thing are two performances in particular: Claire Trevor's and John Wayne's. Producer Walter Wanger wanted Gary Cooper, an established star, and of course, he would have been excellent. Ford went with Wayne and gives his character of Ringo a stunning introduction. Trevor, a brilliant actress, shows us all sides of the fallen woman Dallas. She's the prostitute with the heart of gold; she tolerates the insults and indignities, but still manages to help where she's not wanted, to want what every woman wants, and to fall in love with Ringo.Truly vintage Ford and vintage Ford/Wayne, a collaboration that went on to make many great films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A hard to beat Western classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's "Stagecoach" is one of the most acclaimed Westerns of all-time. It is also notable as the film that made John Wayne a star.The story is fairly simple: a stagecoach trip is made perilous by the threat of Geronimo and his Apaches on the warpath. Nevertheless, a varied group of individuals is determined to make it to their destination regardless of the danger.Perhaps the film's greatest strength is the ensemble cast composed of a number of fine actors and actresses. Thomas Mitchell won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his role, but his was only one of several worthy performances in the film. John Ford regulars John Wayne, John Carradine &amp; Andy Devine were augmented by the likes of Claire Trevor, George Bancroft &amp; Louise Platt, all of whom gave memorable performances. In fact, there isn't a single weak link in the entire credited cast.Ford's direction garnered a well-deserved Oscar nomination, as did the editing, art direction and cinematography. Filming in Monument Valley was an inspired choice that would benefit future Ford films as well. Also worth mentioning is the score, which secured the film's second of two Oscars.All could have been for nought, though, if the stellar acting and assured direction weren't in support of a compelling storyline. Luckily, the Dudley Nichols script juggled the movie's characters masterfully, weaving several story threads into a satisfying tapestry of human drama.In the end, "Stagecoach" is a classic for good reason. John Wayne's star-making turn as the Ringo Kid is not to be missed and it's only one of the film's many attractions. I'd even venture to say that this may be John Ford's all-around best Western, trumping later classics like "The Searchers" and "The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outdated and corny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Listen, "The Searchers" is my favorite movie of all time. I'm a huge John Ford and John Wayne fan. However, "Stagecoach" is just too outdated to be really watchable. Here's what I didn't like:- The film quality is so bad, Monument Valley is barely recognizable.- The so called profound "social relevance" of the movie is a joke. Hey, guess what? If you really had to ride in a stagecoach with a prostitute, drunk, escaped convict and a gambler, you'd be pretty upset too. So the "great theme" of the movie is to sanitize and glorify the criminals and deadbeats and ridicule and parody normal law abiding middle class citizens? As Tom Hanks says in "Big", "I don't get it." - Did the Ringo Kid really propose marriage to Dallas about an hour after he met her? And most of the time he spent with her he was crammed in a sardine can with 6 other people. Sorry I wasn't swept up in the romance of it. Just looked like poor decision making to me. No wonder one's a whore and the other's a convict.- Claire Trevor did nothing for me. I read in a Jimmy Stewart biography that Ford wanted Marlene Dietrich for the part. Too bad, Dietrich was born to play this part, but even she couldn't have saved this turkey.- I'm sure this is heresy, but I thought the 1966 version with Bing Crosby was much better than this. And if that guy Thomas Mitchell got an Oscar as the drunk, Bing should have won a Nobel prize for his performance. And give me Ann Margaret as the whore over Claire Trevor any day.- I felt like I was watching "Airport" or "The Towering Inferno". What a legacy. The first corny disaster movie. A model for so many great films that followed - "Earthquake", "Airport '77". Thank you, John Ford!I think this movie's big rep comes from the story that Orson Welles watched it 40 times while he was making "Citizen Kane". Well guess what? Orson Welles was an overrated pompous a**!!! There. I said it. The emperor has no clothes!!!!!This movie is truly memorable for one reason. It made Duke a star. For people who grew up watching the older Wayne, it is quite a shock to see him so young, handsome, glowing and vibrant. Every John Wayne fan should see this movie for that reason.But if you want to watch "Stagecoach", watch the 1966 remake. It's not half bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Still a modern and original western.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a movie that is mostly mainly set at one location; of course in a stagecoach. It makes this already quite an original movie for its time but its also original with its overall approach. "Stagecoach" is not just purely a western about cowboys fighting Indians, it's also a real character movie, in which all of the characters have their own personality and motivations and start to bond together, since they are all together in the same situation. Under any other normal circumstances they would had most likely never met. It's a movie that has basically everything in it; action, romance, comedy and drama. The fact that the movie is almost entirely set aboard a stagecoach and therefor is always on the move, gives the movie also a great adventurous feeling.You could say that this movie was John Wayne's big breakthrough, even though he had starred in many movies before, including westerns, prior to this movie. He was still a big unknown at the time and isn't even the top-billing actor of this movie. It must be said that he also just doesn't play the biggest role of the movie. He is just one of the characters. It was the first of many collaborations between director John Ford and the actor John Wayne. The movie has a great assembly cast next to Wayne, with actors such as John Carradine and George Bancroft, who were quite big names at the time. It's of course really a movie that allows its actors to shine, since its a movie that mostly relies on all of its characters. I especially liked John Carradine in the movie.It above all things is a great made movie, that is beautifully looking. The John Ford directing for the movie is dynamic and knows to combine elements from all kind of genre, with always keeping the movie look and feel like a western, despite featuring so much different 'non;-western like elements. Ford also received an Oscar nomination for his directing of this movie. The movie received a total of 7 Oscar nominations but took only home 2 awards, of which not the most important ones. I also really liked the movie its Oscar nominated cinematography, which gave the movie a great look and overall atmosphere. The movie also uses some nice settings. For some part the movie was filmed in Monument Valley, Utah. A location director John Ford would use many more times again after this movie but he used for the first time ever in this movie.Some of the stunts in the movie also deserve credit.Guess it's not a movie for just everyone, especially not those who are expecting a typical John Ford or John Wayne western. The movie for most part feels and progresses like a typical '30's drama. It nevertheless is a timeless classic. When people call this movie outdated, they just probably have something against black &amp; white pictures in general, for "Stagecoach" was a quite modern movie for its time and still perfectly holds up this present day.A wonderful timeless movie, even for those who aren't into the western genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A true classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And a first ... a first appearance from Mr. John Wayne! Of course John Wayne had done a few smaller parts before, but this was his big break! And all because John Ford believed in him! Close friends (although one wouldn't say so, judged by their set relationship, Ford being mean and harsh to Wayne), he stick up to John Wayne, although the studios and the producers, wanted known (back then) stars! John Wayne has an unforgettable entrance too, which was deliberate by Ford! But it's not all Wayne here. It's also the story and the other actors who jointly put their work together, to a complete whole! And it was the first Western that used the Monument Valley (fondly named John Ford country later)! This is also, not an all action Western, but more of a character piece! John Wayne will also be seen, in one of his favorite on-screen poses (used by Jean Reno in "Leon" as Homage, in one scene), but there is so much to say here (even if I'm more of a Sergio Leone Fan), about this fantastic movie, that it would break the mold here ... Highly recommended (despite a little sour taste towards the end of the movie ...)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Claire Trevor, John Wayne, Thomas Mitchell, John Carradine, etc. What a terrific ensemble cast! Although Claire Trevor and "the Duke" are nominally the stars of "Stagecoach", they're ably complemented by a great cast of recognizable character actors plus Monument Valley and the stagecoach, itself. Yes, in reality the Apaches would have shot the stagecoach's horses. Further, it's unlikely the Ringo Kid would have either met such a caring, father - figure sheriff or survived the final gunfight. But let's not get sidetracked. This is a lovely film with diverse identifiable themes, interesting characters, wonderful backdrops of Monument Valley, just the right amount of sentimentality and John Ford's renowned detail. I hadn't seen "Stagecoach" for several years and had genuinely forgotten what a treat this film is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Yes the Searchers is powerful and was the first film to represent the Native Indians in a generous manner. Yes Unforgiven was a tour-de-force of direction and symbolism. Yet neither of these can be defined as THE classic western. Stagecoach stands above the rest of them for many reasons. One of John Wayne's best performances in a role which required few words. His presence is phenomenal in the time he has on screen. Clair Trevor is utterly convincing as the wronged woman, and Thomas Mitchell's performance as Doc outshines all and thouroughly deserves his Oscar. The simple story of a bunch of strangers together inside a stagecoach, each with their own problems and reasons, is a simple but believable story. This is the perfect western.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that was a first in so many ways.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If High Noon is the pinnacle of the Western film, then Stagecoach is the groundbreaker. It was the first Western movie to combine John Ford as director, John Wayne as star, and Monument Valley as backdrop. It was the first film that got John Wayne noticed and made him a star. And most importantly, it was the first Western that had a real plot and character development in addition to the requisite shoot-outs. A very fine film from that very fine year for movies, 1939. Standout performances from Claire Trevor, Thomas Mitchell, (who won the Oscar for this role in the year in which he also played Scarlett's father in Gone With the Wind, a reporter in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, and the Beggar King in The Hunckback of Notre Dame!), and of course, Wayne, electric in his first moment onscreen, where he twirls a rifle and yells, "Hold it!" in his famous drawl, and not really any less than that afterwards. Good direction from Ford, great scenery even if the film's in black-and-white, and, (forgive me if I'm being politically incorrect), a very exciting shoot-out with the Native Americans, featuring stuntman Yakima Canutt's breathtaking drop in between the legs of running horses.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"THE" Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If there is one western that set and still sets the guidelines for all other westerns to follow, Stagecoach would be it. John Ford took a simple story, some interesting characters and a newcomer named John Wayne and combined them all to create the greatest western of all time.There is never a dull moment during Stagecoach, which says a lot when compared to other films of the day. Unlike westerns made over the past thirty years, Stagecoach doesn't have guns blazing throughout the film. A credible story is built up which makes the climax all the more interesting.This film has quite a lot of humour as well, helped by throwing a drunk into the situation and a driver with a high-pitched voice. Without these few moments of humour, Stagecoach would have been rather dull, again crediting Ford for knowing when to be funny and when not to. John Wayne's performance is in my opinion top five for his career. One would never know that he had basically no acting experience before this film was made.I would recommend this film to anyone, especially those who are not accustomed to the greatness of John Wayne.8/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The passengers who board the stagecoach, in the town called Tonto, are well defined. There is the whiskey drummer named, Samuel Peacock, who's submissive character lives up to his actor's surname, Donald "Meek". Gatewood the banker. Arrogant and anxious; the supposed pillar of of any community and running out with a valise full of the bank's funds. Hatfield, the so-called gentleman gambler. A possible southern aristocrat, who's probably fallen on hard times as a result of the civil war. Lucy Mallory, the pregnant wife of a cavalry officer, who is joining him at his frontier outpost. We have the likable, drunken doctor, Josiah Boone. Dallas the scarlet woman, the good bad girl who worked in the Tonto saloon, driven out of town along with the whiskey-sodden Doc Boone by the hatchet-faced sourpuss old matrons of Tonto. The stage driver is excitable and squeaky-voiced, Buck. The man riding shotgun is Sheriff Curly Wilcox.On the first leg of the journey to Lordsburg the Ringo Kid, recently busted out of jail, flags down the stage. Curly Wilcox orders Ringo to hand over his Winchester rifle. Ringo tells the sheriff that he may need him to help to fight off Geronimo's Apaches who are on the warpath. Ringo is determined to get to Lordsburg to hunt down and kill the Plummer boys who killed his family.The stage stops at a way station for the passengers to rest and eat. At the next stop, Mrs Mallory gives birth. The now sobered up Doc Boone and Dallas deliver the baby, and the softer side of Dallas surfaces as a result. She tries to get Ringo to make a run for it but he's determined to get the Plummer boys.On the final leg of the journey the stage is attacked by an Apache war party and is saved by the timely arrival of a troop of cavalry. Back in nineteenth century frontier reality Sheriff Wilcox and Ringo would probably have shot and brought down the Apache ponies instead of the riders. Blunting the attack at the beginning of the chase. Likewise, the Apaches could possibly have shot down the lead horses in the coach team. But on the big twentieth century silver screen the tension and excitement would have been blunted for the moviegoers!In Lordsburg Ringo finally catches up and kills the Plummers. He shoots Hank Plummer, played by Tom Tyler, in the street. Hank then crashes through the bat wing doors and into the saloon, and staggers to his death like a drunken man. Tom Tyler would repeat a similar drunken-like performance when in his death throes seven years later as the gunman, Lafe McWilliams, when Errol Flynn kills him off in "San Antonio".Critics have rated this a classic. It may well be; but his later westerns, like the never-to-be-forgotten, "The Searchers", are miles ahead in perfection. Ford raised the western genre from its Ken Maynard, Charles Starrett, and Buck Jones, 1930's "B" picture existence to a well deserved prominence. He took liberties with frontier history. Then who didn't? He did frontier history a favour by painting the harsh and cruel loneliness of human existence in the new republic, in a poetic manner and on the broad canvas of Monument Valley. It has won him plaudits ever since. And how well deserved they are, too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a film that gets into the very core of human existence. We have a ship of fools who all get on board a stagecoach going to a specific location, but all inside of it are going for different reasons. And they are all of different social class. The use of photography, made all the more powerful by the use of light, frame this motion picture perfectly. Such as the chiaroscuro on the prostitute when they all stop for dinner. She sits by a window, and instead of being illuminated as one would expect from such a location, she is in the shadows. And due to her costume, which is also dark, she is cast further and further into the shadows. She sits alone near the window, and the rest of the ship is apart from here, which is meaningful photography in the beginning of this film. Then in the same scene, one individual sits by her and another pair are at the opposite end. Another great use of photography to frame the symbolism of the scene and nature of the characters placed in them, how the interact with one another. Towards the end, we get a reserve shots between 2 of the characters, which highlights their newfound connection as people rather than parts belonging to a particular social class. I believe this movie is full of meaning and progresses well, but that the Hayes Code hurt how impactive this movie could have been. Had they been allowed to say/show certain things more without the stringent limit placed on them by the Hayes Code, the impact could be felt a great deal more than it is. Regardless, it is an impactive film that well deserves it's praise.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love this movie. I grew up on westerns so I am partial to them I guess. But this one is special. I don't think I can explain what makes it so great. It has a good story, but it is much more than that. There was a remake done in 1966 and while it was well done with good actors turning in good performances I was disappointed in it. Of course this was the breakout movie for John Wayne. It is strange to think he was in about 70 films before this one made him a star. He plays the Ringo Kid, a sympathetic character in this film. A disparate group of passengers wind up taking a stagecoach with an army escort due to reports of Indian trouble. The calvary is actually looking to meet up with another group of soldiers though and parts company with the stage about halfway on the journey. There is a crooked bank employee who has stolen money with him, a drunken doctor and a saloon girl who have been forced to leave town, a liquor salesman, a southern gentleman gambler, a pregnant lady, a Marshal riding shotgun and the stagecoach driver on the stage. The crooked banker is in a hurry to reach his destination but is continually frustrated by circumstances. There is a lot of interesting give and take among the different characters. Indians attack the coach during the second half of the trip. Thats as much as I will say about the plot. I heartily recommend this movie. It is a classic and should be seen for that reason alone.

Unlike some of the films I have watched, these characters had so much depth, and every single one of them were not what they appeared to be on the surface. John Wayne was not only a hopeless romantic, believing in true love at first sight, but he cared so much about avenging his lost loved ones. Dallas, despite being a prostitute, was so caring and gentle to Lucy Mallory, who was a woman who was not very caring towards Dallas. Both Dallas and Ringo chose to ignore the judgements people had towards them, and instead showed the audience as a whole that there truly was more than meets the eye, and the people they actually were, were genuinely good people; heroes even.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ringo Kid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overall I enjoyed this movie very much. The plot of this movie was about a traveling stagecoach from Arizona to New Mexico which encountered many problems on their way. I enjoyed the classic western feel to this movie and the well rounded characters that accompanied it. I thought John Wayne did a great job as portraying the Ringo Kid in this movie. He showed his soft side between him and Dallas and also his classic gritty and rough personality showed in this movie. The character I liked the least was Doc Boone because I thought his drunkenness was somewhat excessive and unrealistic. I also enjoyed the cinematic shots of the canyons and valleys throughout the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spectacular Movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was absolutely spectacular. It is hard to believe that John Wayne wasn't taken seriously before this movie after knowing the mega star he became. However, he realized this was his chance and he took it. I have always been a John Wayne fan and anybody who enjoys The Duke should definitely watch this movie. He is a much younger spritely John Wayne but his performance is still inspiring. Aside from John Wayne's always superior casting, each and every character in this motley crew was cast perfectly. The doctor, the prostitute, the gambler, the socialite, the driver, the sheriff, and the "outlaw" come together to form a movie that is truly culturally significant. The beautiful and amazing shots of Monument Valley and of the American Southwest inspire your inner rancher or cowboy and projects the feeling of the open Southwest. John Ford's "Stagecoach" truly stands the test of time and is a must see for anybody who enjoys movies due to its highly revered reviews and its gripping plot that i couldn't get bored of even if i tried.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns have never been a favorite genre of mine but this film was a pleasant surprise. It didn't just focus on the cowboys vs the Indians it had a deeper plot than that. The best part of this film was the depth in which you learn about each character. There wasn't just one main character that we got to watch grow but a group of people who grew not only individually but also as a group. While i did enjoy the the character growth i felt that other than that the plot felt slightly boring and bland. There were little spurts of action but not enough to maintain my focus throughout the whole movie. Overall this movie was enjoyable but a little bit more action would have made it perfect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Western films are not nearly my favorite genre of movie, in fact Stagecoach might be the first movie of its kind that I have ever seen. However, I would definitely watch this again, and I would recommend it to anyone. This movie is so much more than what is on the surface. The scenery in this movie was very well done, and the soundtrack isn't so bad either. John Wayne is truly a star as far as his performance in Stagecoach goes. The sound effects in the movie may be magnified in some area (i.e. sound of horses hooves hitting the ground) but it works to add to the overall effect of the movie. A film that I would recommend to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's Stagecoach employed one of my favorite characterization methods. Putting a very unlikely group together, these characters seem to grow and change in relation to each other, simply by being different from one another and revealing that throughout the story.The film is very stylistic, while still giving each character a little bit of their own unique atmosphere in their introduction. This makes it a little strange (not uncomfortable, not jarring) to see them together, filmed in the singular stylistic way throughout the film. It reflects a bit of what the characters must feel, cramped in a stagecoach with such different people. In particular, collisions of characters like Mrs. Mallory (Louise Platt) and Dallas (Claire Trevor) reflect this uncomfortable atmosphere.Many shots are heavy with shadow, emotion, or suspense, yet there is still so much room for humor in Stagecoach. The balance between tension and humor is perfect, yet unexpected. Not until I had time to reflect on the film did I realize how strange it was to pair those things the way that Ford had done, but it was welcome, and not at all out of place. This play between fun and drama comes to a head in the beautiful series of final scenes.Between shots of Doc Boone (Thomas Mitchell) in the bar, Dallas showing Ringo Kid (John Wayne) her "home" at the Stagecoach's destination, and the coming danger the audience is made aware of, humor, drama, and romance swell to an exciting-action filled sequence: the climax of the film. Artful, fun, and exciting--Stagecoach is truly great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The struggles they face are basic. The interaction between characters wasn't bad, but being that it seems to have been the focus of the film, I was hoping for better. I think they should have culled the less rounded characters from the movie, the banker for instance didn't add anything to the meat of the story, yes there's a reason he's there, for the plot, but he just doesn't add anything interesting. I did really enjoy Doc and Dallas, they were well rounded characters who face conflict, but are both great people at heart who just haven't had life turn out well.The action towards the end was pretty good, but not exactly imaginative. They shoot. Bad guys shoot back. All the bad guys die.</fullReview>

Taking place in the wild west a journey begins with interesting characters all who are in for a wild ride. Director John Ford really does a superb job with this film and the dangerous journey through Indian territory. John Wayne the "Ringo kid" is an interesting character who fancy's the prostitute "Dallas". The lighting in this film works really well because its a black and white film and there are so many things that take effect in this.

		<fullReview>I grew up watching westerns because my dad was such a fan, this is a very memorable one, and it's what brought back Wayne's career. The action with the feel and fantasy of the old west work really well to create a classic. This movie did so well with it's tonality as well, a western can use all sorts of lighting, whether its out on the road or in a dingy saloon, both actors Wayne and Trevor create such interesting drama that you end up watching it not only for the action and cowboy and outlaw feel, but for a bit of story as well. It had the feel that you could keep watching this into the present and future and feel the excitement from this movie. Americans fantasies with the west really shine through on this one, it's wonderful desert cinematography and memorable shots definitely help i=with the dream.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At first I expected this to be the classic western, cowboys and Indians type movie. I didn't think that some characters would make me laugh. The characters made the movie for sure. John Wayne, the Ringo Kid, is the typical bad but good cowboy. Dallas is the girl that Ringo Kid falls in love with, she is thought lowly of at first but by the end of the movie she is much more liked. One of my favorite characters was Doc Boone, he was a very heavy drinker and always sprouted a laugh. When the time came, the doctor was able to take the time to sober himself up and do what he needed to do. Another character that I found very amusing and entertaining was Buck. Buck was the stagecoach driver and was very funny and seemed to be clueless all the time. I also enjoyed Mr. Peacock, he is the man that kept to himself mostly. He made booze and Doc drank all of his whiskey which was always quite humorous.</fullReview>

He was a doctor who had quite the drinking problem and he was pretty funny. Another Character i really enjoyed was Buck. Buck was the guy who steered the horses. He was hilarious. Everything about him was funny. Like his voice, it sounded like his voice was constantly cracking and he reminded me of a little kid. For the most part this movie can relate a lot to other western movies. But the characters in this movie really stand out and make the movie interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Film that Started The Duke</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a western from 1939 directed by John Ford (The Searchers, The Grapes of Wrath, The Man who Shot Liberty Johnson). It was written by Dudley Nichols (Bringing Up Baby, Scarlet Street, The Bells of St. Mary) and Ben Hecht (His Girl Friday, Notorious, Spellbound) who based it off of Ernest Haycox's (Union Pacific, Canyon Passage, Abilene Town) original story. It stars Claire Trevor (Key Largo, Murder, My Sweet, The High and the Mighty) and John Wayne (The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Vance, Rio Bravo).Stagecoach is about a group of strangers traveling down a dangerous path on a stagecoach and while they are hunted by apaches, a romance ensues between Dallas (Claire Trevor) and the famous Ringo Kid (John Wayne).John Ford took a large risk with this movie. Before, westerns were b- movies and weren't taken very seriously after this they became a legitimate genre that were recognized by people as being actually good. Not only does he change a genre but he does a terrific job behind the camera particularly a chase scene between the stagecoach and the apache. This film was also very influential to that of Orson Welles (Citizen Kane, Touch of Evil, F for Fake) who watched it 40 times before directing Citizen Kane.The Duke makes his big break in this movie that led to a career of typecasting of this very role that he plays in this movie. However, this is the one that started it all and he does quite well in it. He plays a cool and macho man that you believe. Despite this is the only character he ever played this was the first time he did it.I have little complaints about this movie, it is funny, exciting, and well acted and would recommend it to most.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was one of the first western movies that I've seen. I was under the impression that horses, guns and cliché's would be the only part of a rather dry story. While there were indeed horses, guns and cliché's, it was not nearly as a bad as what I thought to be true. I believe there was a solid balance between all the characters, from tough to soft. John Wayne was very good in his performance as Ringo. He showed his toughness and his compassionate side many different times. The evolution of Dallas, Doc Boone and Ringo were very well done. Though I did not like how Mrs. Mallory was not portrayed as pregnant, and randomly a baby pops out. I also wish that there was more about Geronimo, and more scenes with the Native Americans. This movie changed my opinion on western movies for the better, and for people with the bias that all westerns are similar I would recommend this film</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Wayne is the epitome of America. Strong, brooding; yet unmistakably flawed. Nobody is going to confused Wayne for a chameleon actor. This is the guy you bring in when you want a John Wayne type personality. One of the first signs of this is here in Stagecoach. All of his mannerisms are present and they play into this John Ford film quite well.I'm a fan of well-made Westerns so I had fairly high expectations of Stagecoach going in and I'm happy to say that it didn't disappoint. The acting throughout is ho-hum without much to write home about, but the execution of dialog and character development is where the films fleshes out into a well told story. One of the beneficial plot devices come in handy as each individual is within the Stagecoach, the story is allowed to develop in a necessary but smooth way. It doesn't feel like these conversations are forced as its natural people are going to open when forced into such close proximity for a length period of time. Had they been in a bar, it would have felt far more unnatural.Visually the film looks good and there is some creative camera tricks pulled out of Bert Glennon's bag of tricks. This as expected is a well crafted film that has very little fat and goes from beginning to end and tells a good story in the process.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach directed by John Ford and was a great movie in every aspect. I do think that it wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be. Also having John Wayne in it made it so much better. His acting job was very good. The stage coach had a variety of people who were all different from one another. They all had their own reason for traveling to get to Lindsburg. It was produced in 1939 when many good movies were produced. The whole scene with the shooting and fighting towards the end was my favorite scene. The guy was jumping from horse to horse and then the stunt where the guy fell off and laid under the coach. He did it perfectly for it being such a dangerous stunt. It was shot well and the camera movement was good.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach - A Not So Bad Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach was released in 1939 and was directed by John Ford. While Westerns are not a favorite film genre of mine, this movie was well made. The stunts were one the most memorable and remarkable parts of the film. They were truly dangerous and extravagant and added much excitement to the film. Thomas Mitchell who plays Doc Boone and George Bancroft who plays Marshall Curly Wilcox both add some much needed humor and good nature to the film as Louise Plat's character Lucy Mallory was such an uptight, serious snob. The friendship between the Ringo Kid and Dallas feels very real, as does their concern, acceptance, and affection towards one another. Claire Trevor's character Dallas adds a lot of spunk, fire, and good nature to the film, but she is wrongly judged by most people, except Doc Boone and the Ringo Kid. It is this mistreatment that keeps your rooting for her and the Ringo Kid throughout the whole film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Going in I had high expectations for this movie because of how highly regarded it is by so many individuals, but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as I thought I would. Not to say that the movie was bad, there were definitely some noteworthy parts in the movie that I found very enjoyable, just not many. The part that stuck out to most to me of course was the end chase scene with the Native Americans attacking the stagecoach. I found this scene to be absolutely amazing. The low angle scenes with the horses jumping over the camera, the camera going back and forth between the two sides of the stagecoach, and just the overall action and stunts hat were done in this scene were fantastic. But other than this scene I didn't really find any other parts of the movie very noteworthy. I didn't really get submerged into the movie, most likely because I didn't really find the story very compelling and most of the characters were rather flat, some of whom I didn't find very necessary. And the few round characters in the movie didn't really have much growth or definitive character traits in the movie. Overall, I found this movie to be alright and rather uninteresting except for the end chase scene; I would most likely not watch this movie again.</fullReview>

It was also the first movie to be shot in the Monument Valley which Ford became known for. Another aspect of the movie scholars note about the movie are Ford excellent use of light and deep focus. Ford seems to use many long shot and close ups throughout the film. Stagecoach was also famous for its famous chase scene across hostile Apache territory and are attacked. The point of the film is that there is good humanity in all of us. overall I give this movie a 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My mom is a big fan of John Wayne and I've seen and liked a lot of his movies already, so I wasn't surprised when I enjoyed Stagecoach. It was interesting and had a lot of characters which made it easy to watch. The stagecoach was traveling to Lordsburg but experienced some difficulties along the way. The passengers at first included the town prostitute, a whiskey salesman, the drunk doctor, a gambler, a wife going to see her soldier husband, and a banker. When the stagecoach driver, Buck, informed the marshal that they might come across the Ringo kid on their journey he decided to tag along. The Ringo kid was on the run and seeking revenge on his brother and father's killer who happened to be in Lordsburg where the stagecoach was heading. Right when they were about to leave, they were warned about the Apaches, a group of Indians who would harm them if they saw them. The passengers decided to carry on anyway even if they could be in danger. The stagecoach came across Ringo kid and the marshal arrested him and put him in the stagecoach. The Ringo kid liked Dallas, the prostitute, and was nice to her when no one else was on the trip. The stagecoach even continued on with no protection, some opposed but majority ruled. He even asked her to marry him and she said she would if he gave up his plan to kill his father and brother's killer. Lucy, the woman going to see her husband, gave birth at one of the stagecoach's stops and this shocked everyone and put the stagecoach a little behind schedule. The Ringo kid had a chance to escape at this stop but didn't because he wanted to help protect them from the Indians. When they finally left again, they ran into the Apaches and a gunfight broke out. Just when it looked like the Apaches were going to win, the US cavalry came and saved the stagecoach and its passengers. When they finally reached Lordsburg, the marshal let the Ringo kid go and look for the Plummers, his family's rivals. When he found them, the Ringo kid killed them and returned to the stagecoach thinking he was going to be arrested again. However, when he returned the marshal let him "escape" and ride off with Dallas. I liked this movie a lot and I can see now how John Wayne was such a big star.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I couldn't quite get into this movie. I grew up on my dad loving spaghetti westerns and his plethora of Clint Eastwood films, but for some reason, whether it's the concept or not, I couldn't wrap myself around it all. The only part I enjoyed was the parts with the Mexican family and the chase scene with the Indians.I didn't find it very interesting, either. I found it a bit dull and not as exciting as it could be. Then again, I was never too stricken by westerns in general. I love the concept of westerns, because there's a certain romanticism with westerns and that time period that people find so endearing. I love cowboys and gunslingers and horses and riding into the sunset, and I can see that with this film, and I liked that it captured that lifestyle as one of the first westerns that wasn't a B flick. I just wish its plot was a bit more engrossing.Overall though, I can see what made it critically acclaimed because of the nature of it, and its character development (even though I couldn't really see any, but that's just me--unless I missed something?). I guess it's just not my cup of tea.</fullReview>

So the universal wisdom and gospel of the movie buffs goes.The fact is that "Stagecoach" (1939) deserves its long enjoyed reputation as a classic.The actors are all wonderful.The script is wonderful.The direction is wonderful.And, for me best of all, the camera work and presentation of Monument Valley, Arizona (owned entirely by the Navajo American Indian Nation, along with the all land along the eastern Arizona/ New Mexico border, including the Painted Desert!) is a thrill and one of the best black and white travelogues every made in the movies.Monument Valley, Arizona (located on the far Northeastern corner of the state) is breathtaking, and "Stagecoach" (1939) director John Ford shows us why.Monument Valley never changes. Same wonderful place 30 years after "Stagecoach" (1939) was made, presented in 1969 in the "Easy Rider" (1969) movie starring Peter Fonda.Another good (color!) depiction of Monument Valley, AZ is presented in "Easy Rider" (1969) shown as Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper motor cycle though it...incredible color sunsets in that movie are wonderful.But the best "Monument Valley" movie of all is "Stagecoach" (1939), which an old friend at my house, screened and re-screened faithfully at least once yearly every year, always reliable, aways welcome, always edifying.Hooray for "Stagecoach" (1939).Make friends with this movie.

The combination creates an all-around stunning and genuine movie, with transcendent performances delivered unto a dramatic screenplay and commanding, pointed direction from John Ford.Beyond the film's immediate successes, it takes the saturated and stale Western genre and reinvigorates it with a wide cast of characters that are forced to cooperate despite their differences. I can't help but be reminded of Firefly whenever I see this movie. The influence Stagecoach had on that show can't be denied.</fullReview>

Overall the acting was very authentic; John Wayne delivers in all aspects and his chemistry with Claire Trevor, who plays Dallas in the film, is amazing and completely believable. The scene where the stagecoach is being chased by the Indians is flawless; the moving camera and the shaking of the picture really added to the scene not to mention the stunts with the horses which were absolutely fantastic.

This was a breakout movie for Wayne as well. This movie surprised me because i typically find most westerns to be boring or follow the same basic plots. This movie had a great storyline building off of a classic motif, piling people of all different walks of life into one stagecoach and seeing what comes about! The sets in the movie were awesome because John Ford actually shot them in the desserts of the Midwest. This gave the movie such a realistic western feel. This movie did stick to many of the same ideas of westerns like outlaw cowboys, and the danger of Native Americans that all these westerners faced.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's no wonder why Ford had such an eye on John Wayne and you can see why in this film. He holds his role and makes you want to watch more of him. This movie really tells a story, and isn't just full of action and violence. The director really went into detail and great effort to give you an actual story to follow. The characters he puts into the movie each have their own story that makes you want to invest your time in getting to know them. Each person in the stage coach gets an even amount of screen time and amount of effort thrown into their characters. The actors give an incredible show and put a lot of emphasis on how their character should act and be shown. It may not feel like this movie is original compared to all the later westerns that have been put out there but this truly was the start of many westerns to come and influence the other westerns that we come to know and love. This movie is incredible and I would recommend this to anyone who likes a good western.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie for the most part was alright. It was just not the type of movie I like to watch. Westerns aren't my favorite and never really have been. It was put together well, it was just hard to keep my attention at times. The fighting and shooting among each other just got old after awhile and it's just something you always see in old western movies so i feel like its never anything different. The ending was probably the best because it was a little suspenseful because they didn't show you what happened between the men until it was over and it showed who came back alive. That was probably the most interesting part to me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach was a bland movie with bland characters. I found that in this movie there is only likable character and it is Ringo played by John Wayne. He is the only one that you can see really having a purpose in this movie and his supporting cast didn't live up to it and felt like they were forced to be there and were not interesting. The story wasn't too engaging as well and the only excitement was the chase towards the end. John Ford did a good job with some aspects of the movie with the way he handles the camera during important scenes and getting a good performance out of John Wayne. That is why Stagecoach gets a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A different Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The classic western film of Cowboys and Indians we see right in this film, you just have to wait until the second of the film to reach that point.This is a western film except it focuses a lot on the characters that are in the actual stagecoach for most of the film. All the people in the stagecoach are strangers, but the film doesn't stop there we learn about all of their stories throughout the film. There is at least ten minutes or more in the film until the main character Ringo(John Wayne)appears with a grand entrance.The film makes Ringo seem so important at first is that he is seen as an outlaw and wanted for arrest. As the stagecoach moves from town to town the more people get in and even more there is news of Indians that will attack anyone once the stagecoach reaches past a certain town.This film uses some of the best editing and the only reason I say that is that this film uses very long cuts that use less editing and not only that but use the actual west for the film.The actual story for the western film may not be so appealing to people, but watching this film you are able to learn what censorship must be used because of the time it was created in. Most people watching the film will not even suspect the female character Lucy is pregnant because that can't be shown in the film the only time you know is when a baby is brought out to the other characters.This film does focus on the law a lot with the Indians that the army can't interfere with and let the group in the stagecoach survive long enough for the army to return and help them get to their destination. One other part is that Ringo takes care of the people that made him wanted for arrest. This film had to end with the good guys winning and the bad guys go away, or the law always win.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To be honest, I was never a fan of the western genre. I have always found with westerns that the plot tends to follows the same general story line and that I usually end up leaving halfway through the film due to boredom. Though I watched the entirety to John Ford's 1939 "Stagecoach", I found myself bored much like every other time I attempted to watch a western. I found the film slow moving and incredibly predictable. There just honestly wasn't a whole lot going on in the movie that I felt all that compelled to pay attention to. Despite my general disinterest in the film, I will say that it did have some redeeming qualities. The actual production of the film was pretty neat. I liked Ford's style of directing - making sure to focus on the landscape and physical aspects of the film. And of course, as it is a western, the chase scene was pretty fun to watch. Though this film ranked nowhere near my top lists of anything in relation to movies, there were some aspects of the film that I can't deny were pretty good. And though not a film I would outright ever recommend, I wouldn't say that this is one to absolutely miss. Just because I was never a fan of the western, doesn't mean that this isn't quite possibly someone's all time favorite movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've never really been a huge fan of westerns because I think the opportunities for the plot to go somewhere different are not extremely broad by any means, each western follows virtually the same or similar plot, though I suppose that is what really defines it as it's own genre. Stagecoach is still charming despite this, with memorable characters, and a great cast. My favorite part was definitely the chase scene, up until that point everything seemed fairly slow paced. What I do love is John Ford as a director, his huge sweeping shots and wide angles that really focus on the scenery is an amazing addition to the film, so much visual language is communicated in these dynamic shots. Also the cinematography of the chase scene is absolutely brilliant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great way to get to know John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939, John Ford) is a classic western, and plays out like one. The acting is good, the characters are rounded and interesting, and the directing is commendable. However, some of it is a little messy, such as when Mr. Hatfield apparently has an unexpected idea to keep Mrs. Mallory from a painful death. The representation of this is a bit unnatural, so the climactic moment is rather poorly executed. I'm of the opinion that when something that meaningful happens, it should be made a little clearer exactly WHAT it meant, so the audience (myself included) doesn't sit there for the remainder of the film wondering what they missed. Otherwise, the plot is thrilling, and the classic western horse-riding chase scenes are wonderfully exciting, spurred on (pun intended) by heroic music. The scenes are very well shot and edited, too. My favorite shot was when Dallas runs down a narrow alley to the bright "light at the end of the tunnel" which is, needless to say, a great example of photographic symbolism. Dallas's turning point comes later, when the social significance of her role kicks in, and it is revealed that the point of her story is to prove that a person's life can turn around, hence her going from a prostitute with a heart of gold to a happily engaged woman. After finally getting around to watching one of John Ford's films, I can say now that I understand what the fuss is about. Definitely worth watching if you care to get a feel for this type of film, and Ford's work in general.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach not the cliché western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is the first western I've seen other than the remake of True Grit. So by default I was expecting this movie to be a lot of cowboy vs the natives in shoot outs, but this movie focused more on the social issues between classes. We meet nine strangers who are forced together by faith, you could say, and the nine were all very different, whether it be their social class or other flaws like being an alcoholic and greedy which separated them. What makes the movie interesting is the interactions between these characters, they are all so different but have no choice but to be around each other and help one another. We also get to look at the development of the characters, see the good in the "bad". Characters like Dallas who are low on the totem pole, but by the end we see that she really has a heart of gold, and of course Ringo (John Wanye) the misunderstood criminal. The movie doesn't focus on cliché western shoot outs but the developing relationships within the characters. But it couldn't be a western with out the good against bad, so there was a chase scene the good guys, our nine strangers, and the natives chasing them on horse back. Over all I enjoyed this western mostly because it wasn't about guns and cowboys, but instead about people and relationships.</fullReview>

I didn't know that this was going to be one of John Wayne's best movies in the Western genre. As for the others, they also did very well in terms of their characters and the writing of the movie. But the true highlight for me is the chase scene with the Indians attacking the stagecoach and the way that some of the men defended it. I didn't know that there was going to be some parts that would intimidate me for a bit, like when Ringo (Wayne) was walking up to a gang of bad guys, but that was unexpectedly good. I find that this was one of the best Western films out there, if it's not THE best.</fullReview>

Action always gets to me and in my opinion for a successful movie. John Wayne played his character exceptionally well in my opinion as well as everyone else for that matter. The story line wasn't very appealing to me and somewhat made me lose interest. Just because I didn't like it doesn't mean that some one else won't.

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is not only a quality film, but an influential one. It set the standard for the modern Western, outside of B film level entertainment (both in its literacy and daring- the stunts of Canutt, during the Apache attack, are justly famed), and it made a star out of John Wayne, right from his dramatic entrance into the film (replete with out of focus zoom and twirling rifle). But it also is a great example of a film that, on the surface, seems to be all cliché and melodrama, but via Dudley Nichols' and Ben Hecht's non-wasteful screenplay (adapted from Ernest Haycox's short story The Stage To Lordsburg which had roots in Guy de Maupassant's short story Boule De Suif), and acting, rises well above such. It resists cliché by subverting it with the performances and writing. There's not even a mediocre performance in the film (look at how often details of plot are conveyed via the eyes of characters). I know of no film where the eyes of its actors convey so much, so many times, and so consistently. Even John Wayne comes across as sympathetic, gentlemanly, and lovable, and most of his 'acting' comes in reaction shots where he is silent or says little. One need only look at many other films from the 1930s to see how different Wayne's acting style was from the remnants of the overly theatrical acting styles of the silent film era actors that were still around. Claire Trevor is adorable as her non-trite version of the hooker with a heart of gold, and Thomas Mitchell won the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, as the Doctor, and deserved it. His progression from drunk to indignant righteousness in the face of Luke Plummer's gunbarrel, is truly a pleasure to watch, and a clinic in acting subtlety and bravado in tandem. The other Oscar the film won was for musical scoring, for Richard Hageman, W. Franke Harling, John Leipold, and Leo Shuken, yet, the score is really unmemorable, and the worst scene in the film (one of only a few points which keep the film as a near-great, not great film) is a scene where the Apache wife of a local Mexican sings. It simply is out of place in the film. The cinematography, by Bert Glennon, is quite good, especially in the Apache chase sequence that alternates between live locations shooting, and rear screen projections, and in numerous compositions in Monument Valley.As mentioned, watching Stagecoach, then comparing it to later films in Ford's canon, is sort of depressing, because it makes one wonder how much of this film's success was just happenstance, since, such a literate and well acted film never again made its way to the screen under the John Ford name. Nonetheless, watching this film was a pleasure, both in and of itself, and in how it is that rare work of art that forcefully demonstrates to me that even I can succumb to the rigors of habit, in expecting too little from a certain work of art merely because most works of art, in any genre, or from any artist, so often conform to one's worst expectations. Thus chastened, I implore anyone else with that or a similar bias to toss it aside, for a while, and allow its destruction under Stagecoach's ever turning wheels. What's left won't be worth much, if at all, but often it's the loss of something that is the best part of the thing. I think Doc and Curly would agree.</fullReview>

Watching it again as an adult I have completely changed my opinion and have gained a new respect for this film. The main area of this movie that really stands out to me is how John Ford introduces us to nine characters and makes each one stand out in their own unique way while still moving the story along in at a pace that lets the viewer fully understand what is going on while still keeping things interesting.The part of the movie that really surprised me was how Ford addressed some social issues that of the time. It was interesting how most of the characters were initially presented as unsavory people but throughout the the film they each proved to be caring and selfless. Take the character Dallas for example, through almost the entire movie she tried to help Lucy and yet at the end Lucy still snubbed her because she was a prostitute.</fullReview>

The camera makes it believable because it is shaky just like you would imagine it to be if you were on horseback. I thought the transitions went from scene to scene very nicely. There is one scene that shows great talent from the actor. They did not have stunt doubles back then, so they truly were doing their own work. The lighting was very dark at times and it really helped create the mood for the dark characters. Over all Impressed.</fullReview>

For those passengers being exiled, by the end they all seem to find a better and happier ending. on the other hand our highest class passenger Mrs. Mallory remains pretty much the same, and even after all that Dallas does for her, in the end all she can manage is to ask for her coat back. The characters each had a story and a personality all their own, and tough we don't get to learn much about all of the characters you get to be with them through some tough times, and feel for them as they make this long dangerous journey across Apache land to a civilization far away from their pasts and problems.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach was directed by John Ford in 1939. While still early in the movie production era, the film had great cinematography. Stagecoach is a classic "cowboys and Indians" genre film, which was quite popular at the time. They were fast paced and violent with several action scenes spread apart between as to just not lose the audiences focus. During the 1930's sound had been introduced into the movie making business. Although primitive films were able to express its message to a far greater extent. This was Ford's first attempt at a sound movie. His project turned a success despite minor fluctuations in sound from scene to scene.</fullReview>

I have only seen a few of John Wayne's movies and this just proves even more how great of an actor he really was! There is a lot of emphasis with his character but not so much that the other characters are forgotten about or over looked. I am not a huge fan of western movies in general, but I feel like this movie was very good. What I enjoyed most was the exciting scene where the stagecoach is being attacked. I thought it was very well done and it seemed like you were really there watching it happen in the desert. Also, I thought the movie in general was believable because every detail was payed attention to even down to the way that everyone was dressed and the way places were decorated. I would recommend this movie to anyone that is interested in any western type movies because it has a lot of exciting aspects to it.</fullReview>

It's a successfully invigorating action/adventure movie that isn't about the cast's survival(as they're not too worried about that), but their dauntless, spirited trek through dangerous territory. Thomas Mitchell as Doc Boone is a particularly enjoyable performance. I laughed at the scene where they're sobering him up. I laughed at a lot of scenes with him.

		<fullReview>This movie is intense. The dramatic power of the is movie is off the charts. Clare Trevor is both beautiful and vulnerable; she is the star. The other players are outstanding too; their performances are legendary. Yet, Ms. Trevor's performance brings a tear to your eye and a lump to your throat - without it being hokey, corny or contrived. The scene where she shows Ringo where she is lives - in a whorehouse - is the climax of movie, for it there that Ringo is confronted with the truth of who she is and now duly informed must decide what to do. In fact, remove Ms. Trevor from this movie and the movie fails because there would be no story. John Carradine's performance is also particularly noteworthy. Here, he portrays a gambler with a shady reputation but as the story progresses he reveals another more noble side; the same can be said for Doc Boone, played by Thomas Mitchell. Some my say that this is not the best western movie. Others may say that the story contains too many clichés. And others may say that the movie is outdated, a relic of the past, an antique, to be relegated to the closet, attic or shelf. Well, they'd all be wrong. This movie was great when it was made in 1939 and is still great today. That this movie is still watchable is proof of the story's strength. The director, John Ford, manages to bring together the script, the scenery and above all the acting to create a classic, a movie that withstands the test of time. Especially powerful are the two characters, Dallas and Ringo, played by Claire Trevor and John Wayne. Both give outstanding emotionally charged performances, one as a prostitute, the other as a cowboy, both with pasts, whose paths cross. Far from being stagy or corny, Mr. Ford manages to inject into their relationship a bond that transforms the movie from a typical cowboy movie into a cinematic and artistic masterpiece. Thomas Mitchell also gives a notable performance in this wonderful movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Westerns aren't for everyone, but as a child watching them all the time you almost feel as if it was a movie that was captured at that time somehow. As funny as that sounds it allows me to watch a western and seek that feeling because if it manages to do so then the film is a success in my book. Stagecoach is a success. Looking back at the movie it must have been difficult to shoot scenes in such a cramp area and in order to have the camera on who was talking they must of had to continue to shot and revise to make sure the conversations had a natural flow. Even though it took a while to find that person you were going to root for in the film it felt natural to me because it allowed for things to develop on screen instead of just implying what had happened. Some may have been implied, such as Ringo's father's death, but that was not necessary to show. It was sad to see how important classes and social status was to the character especially Mrs. Mallory, but nice to see how Ringo looked past that and created a genuine affection for Dallas. I'm not sure if classes were as important in the time of the film, but if it was it was nice to see it challenged through film. It's always wonderful to see films that break the boundaries. The building of so many different elements such as romance, respect, and danger makes the film a great beginning to the many sound westerns to follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film, Stagecoach was directed by John Ford in 1939. A typical, Hollywood western film, it featured the legendary John Wayne. It was shot in Utah. There was much controversy over having Wayne in the film. Ford had been turned down by many studios for financial backing. Finally, he was able to come to an agreement with a financer, but John Wayne could not have top billing as the star, instead it was given to Claire Trevor. This role, ended up being the role that made John Wayne. Wayne portrayed Ringo Kid, a prison escapee who hops aboard a stagecoach on it's way to Lorsburg. Claire Trevor portrayed a prostitute, who was outcast from her town. You can't help but feel sorry for Trevor. Two of the screen shots with Wayne are timeless. One scene is when they are all in the stagecoach, appearing to be resting, and he peaks out from under his hat. The second was when Wayne stops the Stagecoach after his escape. The scenic background, the way he rolls his rifle it is a "look" that showed his iconic nature.While some of the filming was very realistic, such as the western town scenes, and the Indian chase on the horses, there were some that did not appear as realistic. For example, in one of the scenes when the stagecoach was on the run, John Wayne is sitting on top of the roof, others are around it, as the stagecoach is on the run, the background looks very artificial and you can tell that it is not a live moving stagecoach. At times, some of the scenic backdrops were obviously not real. Music seemed to contribute to the movie as well. The runaway scenes had swelling chase- type music. The filler type of music seemed to contribute to the movie in general.</fullReview>

The perfect entrance, I should say, as the camera pans quickly in to show the new cowboy arrival, Instantly across the nation women swoon. And it's little things like that that made Orson Welles watch this umpteen times.There's also the entrance of the Geronimo Indians, another textbook way (nowadays, anyways)to shoot a buildup scene, in the classic ABABABA style, creating tension by constantly shifting between the Indians and the patrons on the stagecoach.The plot is really inconsequential to a movie that's all about the details, and anyone can pick up several textbook techniques by just watching a few minutes of this film. I keep saying "textbook" and I have to remind myself, this movie wrote the book.</fullReview>

The filming of the movie was a new age of cinema with breathtaking shots that often brought long-shots of the vast monument valley to the close-ups of individuals speaking in the Stagecoach. Stagecoach set the bar for what Western's really should be like, and John Wayne gave a performance of a lifetime as the "Ringo Kid". Although most of the story took place in the stagecoach, it never seemed to bore me. I link this to the terrific job of Ford of giving many different types of characters. John Ford added round and flat characters while not entering the Protagonist into the film for at least a half an hour in. This really leaves you wondering where the movie will take you next. This keeps you on the edge of your seat while keeping you interested with everything that went on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Stagecoach" Should Really Fly First Class</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Stagecoach" is truly an amazing movie. As with most Westerns, the film captures the truly beautiful landscapes of the famous Monument Valley. In the beginning, a series of wide shots show the long train of horses and stagecoach traveling amongst the buttes and truly amazing scenery of the American Southwest. I did wish that this movie was shot in color, not because I dislike black and white, but because I have visited the Southwest and know the colors add tremendously to the grand atmosphere. The sets are well constructed with the small, western style town being the foundation of what audiences will consider 'western'.The character relations and the comment the movie makes on people in general is what really makes this movie a must see. "Stagecoach" shows how people interact?the awkwardness, the body language, the expressions, and all. The movie is like a mix of the show 'The Real World' and 'Lost' with truly different people confined to the stagecoach together, yet having to work together to survive the constantly looming Apache. You observe how certain types of people gravitate towards one another. True sexual tension and flirtation is contrasted by utter disdain. The characters are mostly all stereotypes in some way or another. It is ironic, yet possibly quite true to life, how the "gentleman" and "gentle lady" are the most judging people in the movie, while the "prostitute" has the personality and traits we are all taught to have (except for her 'profession'). The chasing scene, where the Apache are in hot pursuit of the stagecoach, is the action-packed highlight of this movie. Quick shots back and forth between both parties, amidst gunfire, create excitement and anticipation. And the ending is anyone's guess. Will Ringo survive?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach: Review</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a beautifully written, character driven story of the American West. The movie delivers great themes such as identity, fear of the unknown, racism and romance. Director John Ford creates a great mental picture of the western frontier in its infancy. Many Americans at this time were moving west from the east coast to find success and start a new life. The problem is that Native Americans, unknown to many, had already been settling this land for centuries. So you can imagine, an American with the idea of Manifest Destiny in their heads would do anything claim this land. You can also imagine a resistance between these two groups. Each character in this film had a different reason for leaving; from outlaws, to prostitutes to a wife looking for her husband. So the question this film proposed is identity. Do you remain yourself or do you become another person? Much of the West at that time was unmapped and it was a risk to migrate west for fear of being killed by Native Americans starvation or the fear that all humans hold; what they can't see and understand. I can't forget to mention the great action with good old fashion gun slinging and a remarkable chase seen involving John Wayne's character jumping from one horse to another while they're running at full speed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>although this movie is not the best I've ever seen the movie is still spectacular. this movie has all the appropriate elements of a western movie without being overly cliché. the dichotomy between some of the characters, especially the two women, makes for a very interesting trip across the "wild" west. John Ford's use of the doctor, the stereotypical hispanic, and many of the other characters to stop the movie from feeling overly dramatic or depressing (with the impending doom of local savages attacking)also shows the true western feel. what i found truly amazing was that the film crew actually filmed large portions of this movie out in the west, and the beautiful natural landscape added a feeling of actually being there that is not possible with a Hollywood set. i truly believe that the decision to film this movie in it's actual setting is what really helped to push the movie to its legendary status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Western Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have never really been into Western movies but after watching this it makes me appreciate the genre a lot more. I know that John Wayne was a famous western actor and appeared in many movies during the height of Westerns. He is a very good actor, reading about this movie I found out that this movie was Wayne's breakthrough role.It is good to see the original word of a acting legend. The setting of the story in Monument Valley brings out the true beauty of the location and the film. I like how all the different personalities come together to ride to one place, some of them are funny and some more serious. Doc Boone played by Thomas Mitchell is one of the funniest, he is an alcoholic doctor who is drunk for a lot of the film. I like Ringos cocky attitude and is he is confident in everything he does. This movie is one that I recommend as a beginning to Westerns, after seeing this it makes me want to see more of Wayne's films from the period. Today western films aren't as popular so I am glad I got to see this one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach is a 1939 western film. The film was shot in the middle of a desert. The people are traveling in a coach to their destination and they know that it could be dangerous. The people in the coach have different personalities and some of them don't like each other. But they do get along and help each other when its needed. This film has a lot of action especially when they have to fight with the Indians and they run out of ammo you think that they are done for but help comes. The scene at the end is the best cause it makes you wonder what happens. There is a shoot off between Ringo and this guy. And all you hear is the gun shots and don't even see what happens cause the camera is focusing on another scene in the film. You then see the guy walk into the bar and you think that he has won but he ends up collapsing and you realizes that Ringo won.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach is basically the first real mature Western movie I have seen. This film was rather very enjoying.The beginning of this film was a little bit confusing for me, not knowing which character is which, they all looked similar and were in an enclosed area throughout the film. All the actors did quite an amazing job at playing their characters. The only memorable one that I personally can remember is John Wayne (figures).The setting was spectacular, and made the film jump to life. It helped the film capture such realism that made you think "wow that could have really happened back then in the West".What I really loved of this movie and so many others will too, is the film makers making it unpredictable in many places. The feeling of knowing something, but finding out differently intrigues many people to watch all the way to the end of a film.So if you enjoy Westerns or never really watched them this is the movie to watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film stagecoach released in 1939 is a great example of a classic American western film. The genre of western films is the only genre named after its setting. And the film stagecoach does it justice. The setting in this film is amazing, shot in a desert location. It gives viewers a real look at the civilization that existed back then. How the town looked also, how traveling was made possible. The types of clothing the people wore. The different types of social a class that existed back then, but in a way they still exists today. The actors are also great. They do a good job play the roles they have. The actor and actress make the film feel real for viewers. Western films are general not my type of film, I often find then dull and boring. What made this film work for me unlike other western films was the variety of different types of personalty's. Also seeing how these different personalities's come together and interacts with one another. The end scene was a scene I really enjoyed. The way the guy walked into the bar like he won the battle but then drops to the ground indicating that Ringo won. For I moment I was upset but then I realized Ringo did win. I was relieved. I like how the directed set this scene up to trick the viewers for a moment then revealed the truth. It was brilliantly done in my opinion a good directing technique. I would say it was not a bad film. A little slow on the action but entreating the whole way though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comraderie in the Old West</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An unlikely group of companions is lumped together in a stagecoach... some are kicked out of town, another is heading home to her husband, and others are on the lookout for Geronimo and his Indian warriors. But they form an alliance that works out for the best of them all.This film is notable for the casting of John Wayne (formerly a B-movie actor) and the direction of John Ford. But, for me, Wayne's portrayal of the Ringo Kid takes sort of a back seat. The real talent is John Carradine, who I think may also have been largely unknown at the time (both men were paid less than an actress whose name I cannot recall). His role as the gambler and his distinct look made him the anti-hero to root for.Also, Doc Boone (played by Thomas Mitchell), who my friend Matt classifies as one of his favorite movie drunks. I concur. Boone is a good-hearted man who wants to help his friends and neighbors, but has a bit of a drinking problem. This does not make him incapable of doctoring or violent... just happy and silly, which mixes well and goes even better with his love of quoting classic literature. He is a true renaissance man with a taste for whiskey.While I'm not generally a fan of westerns, this one works well because the cowboys versus Indians parts are fairly minor, and the real story is how a diverse group of characters interact. And they interact well, causing this to be a win for the writer, director and the actors. A must see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Let me start out with saying this: I am not a western fan. So I was not looking forward to seeing this movie. I had also never seen a movie starring John Wayne, but of course, I had heard about his premier acting skills and John Ford's great directing. I have to say that I really enjoyed this movie and the hour and a half of it went by so fast that I didn't want it to be over when it was. The editing was so excellent that the whole movie flowed together very well. The group of people that were thrown together in the stagecoach: the prostitute, the alcoholic doctor, the whiskey salesman, and the woman going to find her husband was such an odd mix of people. But that mix of people worked really well together, and the fact that Ringo (Wayne) fell in love with Dallas (Claire Trevor), the prostitute made the story even more so amusing. I can't say that I am a fan of westerns yet, but I did enjoy this well done movie.</fullReview>

It was filled with some laughs for everyone, romance for the ladies and action for the guys (That chase scene at the end is one of the best scenes of all time in my opinion the camera-work, sound, etc. was absolutely brilliant) and even the music was good.

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach made a Western fan out of me!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford's Stagecoach (1939) set the bar for future Western films. Westerns were generally B films but Ford was determined to create an A classic Western. So he did just that! Ford turned B film actor John Wayne into a star and reestablished Western films into the 1930's; which wasn't a great time period for this genre. This film deals with stereotypical characters who turn out to be good people with moral values despite a bad reputation.All of this is wrapped up in a fast paced classic Western with gunfighting, chase scenes and amazing stunt work. The last part of the film is is packed full of action and suspense. Ford even breaks the 180 degree rule but it is barely noticeable because the scene is so well done that it sucks the viewer right in. The scene is so fast, well edited and put together that I didn't even realize that the camera angle had switched to the opposite side of the action! I suppose that was Ford's intention to make the viewer unaware of this and he did a fantastic job.Ford has made me a fan of the Western genre!</fullReview>

Not only does this film have one of the most impressive shoot out scenes, where John Wayne executes a couple of very impressive and dangerous stunts, but it is so delicately and tightly crafted that there is no room for the viewer to experience one bored moment.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the definitive western. Most of the parts are played well by the cast. Even the western cliché characters are given life with good writing and directing. The comic relief character seems feels real because he reacts with other characters like a normal person in troublesome situations and John Wayne's character redefines the cliché of the clicheless protagonist. It sounds like a paradox, but if you have seen westerns then you know what I'm talking about, the everyday hero. The cinematography uses good framing techniques and lighting to make the setting look more beautiful. Everything is made clear and the reactions made by actors are easier for eyes to digest. The action scenes are also really good for the time and use great shots and lighting to distract the viewer from spotting small flaws in the movie. This is one of those movies that has a decent storyline, but its main strength is narrative more than anything.</fullReview>

He is not alone as he is with several other outcasts traveling towards a number and threats and various kinds of figurative and redemption. the plot couldn't be more self explainitory as a crew of eight takes a stagecoach from Tonto to Lordsburg, trying to avoid Geronimo on the way. of course, the crew had problems of their own with the government and were mostly likely gonna strike at any moment. with the stagecoach shifting from outpost to outpost,the relationships of the passengers emerge,helping each other to find themselves and providing hope and some sort of victory. maybe leading new life and no more complications!</fullReview>

Westerns are just not my taste, and i frankly couldn't wait for it to get over. John Wayne does a good job portraying his character, but at times I think its a little over done, loosing some of the authenticity. The actual filming of the movie was pretty nice though I must say that. A lot of the scenes/sets looked very real, so I'm assuming a good portion of the film was actually filmed on location. The action scenes were plentiful enough to break up the movie. I honestly thought they were pretty well done, very realistic, at least for the time period. They happened quite quickly and there was well depth to them I guess you could say. Like they were more than just watching someone performing a stick up.</fullReview>

Watch the scene in Nevsky when the Teutonic Knights appear. Same few bars as when the Plummer boys start walking down the street in the dark. Alexander Nevsky was produced in 1938.

		<shortDescription>Ford puts John Wayne on a Stagecoach to the Stars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Director John Ford creates magic with some stereotypical passengers on a "Stagecoach": Thomas Mitchell (as drunken Doc), Claire Trevor (as prostitute Dallas), John Carradine (as gambler Hatfield), Donald Meek (as timid Peacock), Louise Platt (as pregnant Lucy), and Berton Churchill (as banker Gatewood). Steering the coach is Andy Devine (as comic Buck), and riding shotgun is George Bancroft (as lawman Curly Wilcox).Ford makes an already great film a cinematic masterpiece by having the coach pick up John Wayne (as "The Ringo Kid"). Note how the camera treats the arrival of Mr. Wayne - it is literally a re-introduction to the actor, who was then approaching his 100th film. Possibly, Ford's increasing close-up of Wayne was only meant to highlight the legendary "Ringo Kid" character, but it certainly achieved much more - Wayne is stunningly approached, and Ford's camera clearly loves him."Stagecoach" is extraordinary. It's difficult to isolate individual elements as being "better" that others, but the traveling coach scenes are beautifully done, from both the inside and outside of the coach. Wayne's introduction, and boarding, are highlights, of course. The off-coach stop-over, with Wayne and Ms. Trevor conversing in the nighttime outdoors, is equally beautiful. Writer Dudley Nichols' scenario is great, and the characterizations universally appealing. "Stagecoach" is an absolutely essential viewing trip. ********** Stagecoach (2/15/39) John Ford ~ John Wayne, Claire Trevor, Andy Devine, Thomas Mitchell</fullReview>

Tension runs high and that several of them is anxious or nervous for private reasons don't help either. In the middle of the apache territory, there are medical complications, and they are all alone, the soldiers that should be there are missing. They decide to make a run for it, but the Indians catch up with them.An interesting movie, especially as you can divide it on two parts. The first rather extensive part is where the very interesting characters is both introduced and developed. And I must say, the entire cast is very good at portraying their characters. And all have their own, secret or known agenda, which make the discussions and developments rather interesting. The other part, more action filled, start when the apache catch up with the stagecoach. A classic chase with some very interesting stunts... very entertaining to watch.A very important movie, both for John Wayne and the western genre, that was fun and entertaining to watch. 7/10</fullReview>

Clearly, this movie is a national institution, helped establish a film genre, became a pictograph of part of our history, and made the careers of more than one actor. However, it was watching it again this morning that I came to realise how some scenes are masterfully composed. I am not talking about Monument Valley, Utah, the scenes most associated with John Ford. The compositions I was impressed by took place early in the story at Chris' stagecoach stop. Chris was the Mexican proprietor with the Apache wife ("They don't bother me..., I think...). Recall the moment at night with the Vaqueors sitting around a small fire. Each of them is wearing a broad brimmed hat (not quite a sombrero) and a serape'. One man has his foot up and is holding a guitar. The scene appears to be lit solely by the fire (a skillfull illusion in the days of "slow" black and white film!). The camera remains still on thise scene for a moment.

I think John Wayne is really good in this, my favorite of his movies. I really like the way his character, Ringo, respects Dallas (played by Claire Trevor). He's the first to acknowledge her as a lady, but Dallas thinks it's only because he's unaware of her disreputable past. She doesn't realize that he loves her.One of the best scenes in this is the chase with the Indians. This is real nail-biting excitement! That scene is definitely one of the most memorable in the movie.Last, but not least, I'd like to say that I absolutely love Thomas Mitchell in this, his only Oscar-winning performance. He was such a great actor, and his unforgettable performance ranks up with other such performances as Gerald O' Hara in "Gone With the Wind", Uncle Billy in "It's a Wonderful Life", and many, many more. This is a movie you don't want to miss!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From Oscar nominated director John Ford (The Grapes of Wrath, How Green Was My Valley, The Quiet Man, The Searchers, The Man Who Shot Liberty Valance), I had heard about this film many times in the past, I knew it was favourite in the genre, and it being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die I was much more keen to see it. Basically in 1880, a group of strangers board a stagecoach from Tonto, Arizona Territory journeying to Lordsburg, New Mexico Territory, the travellers are ordinary at first glance. They include prostitute Dallas (Claire Trevor) driven away from town, alcoholic doctor Doc Josiah Boone (Oscar winning Thomas Mitchell), pregnant Mrs. Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) travelling to see her cavalry officer husband, and whiskey salesman Samuel Peacock (Donald Meek). The stagecoach driver Buck Rickabaugh (Andy Devine) is told by Marshal Curly Wilcox (George Bancroft) that his normal shotgun guard has gone searching for fugitive the Ringo Kid, who has vowed to avenge the deaths of his father and brother, killed by Luke Plummer (Tom Tyler), so the marshal rides along as guard. U.S. cavalry Lieutenant Blanchard (Tim Holt) informs the group that Geronimo and his Apaches are on the warpath as they set out, they pick up two more passengers, gambler and Southern gentleman Hatfield (John Carradine), and banker Ellsworth Henry Gatewood (Berton Churchill), who has embezzled $50,000 from his bank. Along the way they come across the Ringo Kid (John Wayne), although they are friends Curly takes him into custody, as the trip goes on Ringo comes to strongly like Dallas. The stage reaches the Dry Fork, and the expected cavalry detachment has gone to Apache Wells, Buck wants to turn back, but Curly demands a vote, only Buck and Peacock objects and they proceed on to Apache Wells. They stop only for lunch, and find out more about each other, and on arrival Mrs. Mallory faints hearing that her husband has been wounded in battle, then she goes into labour, Doc Boone assists delivery, and Dallas emerges holding the healthy baby girl, later that night Dallas is asked by Ringo to marry him, she does not answer immediately, but agrees the next morning. There are signals of an oncoming Apache attack, so the passengers return to the coach to avoid any encounters, they reach Lee's Ferry, Ringo is released from his handcuffs to assist helping with logs to float the stagecoach across the river, all the sudden Apaches set upon them, there is a long chase, Peacock and Buck are hit, and Hatfield is fatally wounded, but the 6th U.S. cavalry arrive and rescue the group. The stagecoach finally arrives Lordsburg, the local sheriff arrests Gatewood, Mrs. Mallory is told her husband's wound is not serious, she and Dallas reconcile, Dallas asks Ringo not to seek vengeance against the Plummers, but he is determined to settle matters, Curly lets him go and gives him his gun. A shootout ensues, Ringo dispatches Luke and his two brothers, he returns and expects Curly to put him in jail, however he is allowed to board a wagon and "escape" with Dallas, with Curly and Doc laughing as the horses get moving. Also starring Chris-Pin Martin as Chris. Wayne became a big star following his great noble performance in this film, and Mitchell does give a great award winning performance as the drunk doctor, the film has only a few locations, the most frequent being inside the title transportation, but there are sweeping landscapes, including the iconic Monument Valley, the characters are good and the action sequences grab your attention, it is a most worthwhile and splendid western. It won the Oscar for Best Music, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing. John Wayne was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, and he was number 13 on 100 Years, 100 Stars - Men. Very good!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I gave Stagecoach a 5 out of 10 stars because I am not a big fan of westerns, so it was hard for me to appreciate this film. Although John Ford is a great director, and John Wayne did an amazing job acting. The story is rather simple. The Ringo Kid (Wayne) joins an eclectic group of people traveling from Arizona to New Mexico by horse and buggy through Monument Valley in 1880. In a racist shot at Native Americans, Apaches are always on the warpath, even gunning for our stagecoach filled with these ordinary people. After the cavalry detachment pulls away its escort, the coach is ripe for Indian attack. It will have you on the edge of your seat at times. There is a solid dynamic between the characters that definitely draws the viewer in. John Ford makes excellent use of lighting throughout the film to set a tone with in particular scenes. Also, the stunt work in the Indian chase scene was fabulous. Knowing how dangerous the stunts were makes the scene even more memorable. Despite my general disinterest in the film, I will say that it did have some redeeming qualities. The actual production of the film was pretty neat. I liked Ford's style of directing - making sure to focus on the landscape and physical aspects of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sad to say that Stagecoach was really a 4 out 10 for me but the chase scene at the end bumped this movie up to at least a 6.Stagecouch portrays a story of an unlikely group individuals who have to travel together from Tonto to Lordsburg while trying to avoid the Apaches. Over the course of the trip, the group works together while learning something about each other along the way.Sadly I did see any real character development in the film. The story could have been pushed further and the audience could have learned a lot more about each character. By the end of the film, the story seemed to all of a sudden be all about Ringo Kid and Dallas with his loose back story of revenge and their unrealistic plans to run away together.Although the story/plot was weak the most undeniably great scene was the chase scene between the group on the stagecoach and the Apaches. The stunts were absolutely fantastic and extremely impressive for the time this film was made. The shots taken during this scene were also very smooth and controlled while still creating urgency and chaos.Not a film I would watch again or perhaps even recommend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrific Cast, Action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939) **** (out of 4) John Ford's landmark Western doesn't contain the same punch as I'm sure it did in 1939 but it's still a very impressive achievement. Of course, the film will always be remembered for making John Wayne a star but it's also a film that took the genre out of the low-budget "B" range and put it high on the studios list of films to make. The story is fairly simple as a different range of people are trying to make it through Indian territory with the deadly Geronimo liable to attack at any moment. There's a lot to admire in this film but for me the greatest thing about it is the ensemble cast. Not only do we have Wayne as the Ringo Kid but we get Claire Trevor, Andy Devine, John Carradine, Donald Meeks, Thomas Mitchell, Louise Platt and George Bancroft. Each cast member really does a wonderful job at making their characters more that one-dimensional stereotypes and they also made the return for characters to be a mixture of good and evil. In way too many Westerns people were either good or bad without too much in between. This trend started when sound came into play and studios were making "heroes" but Wayne's character here proves that you could be both good and bad and still be a hero. It's easy to see why Wayne would become a star with this movie because there's so much energy behind him even when he's talking with that laid back style or walking at a calm pace. Carradine is another stand out to does a great job and his work with Ford was always quite impressive. The scenery is another major plus as is the cinematography. Who will ever forget those beautiful shots of Monument Valley or that incredible first shot of Wayne's character? The action scenes are filmed with so much detail that you feel as if you're right down in the middle of everything going on. Ford's direction is at the top of his game and really makes for a fun ride.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stagecoach</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I really loved this movie and all of the characters. The doctor was my favorite character. It was well acted, beautifully filmed and humorous as well. This movie drew me in, so much so that after a while I forgot to pay attention to the analysis and how it was made. I love a happy ending! The characters were all equalized in the end-the doctor became the criminal instead of John Wayne, and Dallas and Lucy bonded. I loved John Wayne although I didn't think this was his greatest acting. There were parts of it that felt choreographed, like the ladies walking Dallas out of town and the men moving in to look at the baby. It was graceful in a way. The best scene was when the Apaches attacked the stagecoach, it was tense and exciting, even though I knew what was going to happen. The look and feel of this movie was wonderful and I will probably watch it again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Ford made what has often been considered the classic western of the 1930's here. This is another of the great films in the year 1939 which had OZ and GWTW. This was one of the greatest years to have been a theater patron in the history of films.John Wayne &amp; Claire Trevor head a talented cast where the story and the great back drops of Monument Valley are exploited to great advantage by Ford. The story is simple and straight forward involving the coach and its journey across the west. Journey themes often make for successful films and this works.You have to give credit for this original cast for bringing this film off so well to. If you don't think so, see the 1960's re-make with Red Buttons which failed and there was another one since too.If you like the chemistry here between John Wayne &amp; Claire Trevor, you must see the less known and under rated DARK COMMAND they did together after this film. These 2 films together are as classic a pair for the Western Genre of films as any two films I can think of.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a 1930s "Breakfast Club"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Before comparing "Stagecoach to "The Breakfast Club," I'd like to discuss why I believe romances in old movies are often as immoral as the sexual affairs in modern films.I'm not thrilled with sexually explicit movies featuring virtual strangers sleeping with each other, but I think people who say classics are morally superior are wrong. Old films often feature pretty young women going crazy over every guy they see even if the man is middle-aged and ugly, people who just met discussing spending the rest of their lives together, and passionless marriages. These romances are NOT virtuous.In "Stagecoach," John Wayne's Ringo Kid proposes marriage to Claire Trevor's Dallas on the day they met. Before his proposal, they spent just a few minutes alone, never kissed, and often weirdly stared at each other. He has NO idea who she is. More alarmingly, he is under arrest, but wants Dallas to move to his ranch in Mexico and wait for him for years while he's in jail. Ringo is very stupid, selfish, and immoral.The romance would have been better if they snuck off and, well, did it ? or at least did something passionate. Instead, as he thinks he's about to go to jail for several years, he says goodbye to Dallas by shaking her hand. I'm not kidding. This is NOT a virtuous romance.But, director John Ford deserves credit for raising the quality of Westerns by making "Stagecoach" (1939) a character study rather than a shoot-em-up. Like "The Breakfast Club," it is mostly about characters with major problems or flaws. Ringo is a convicted ? albeit framed ? killer. Lucy is pregnant. Dallas is a hooker, Doc Boone an alcoholic, Hatfield a gambler, Peacock a whiskey salesman, and Gatewood a thief.The above seven characters are in a stagecoach that's traveling from Arizona to New Mexico through Apache territory. Their interaction is reminiscent of the relationship of the characters in 1985's "Breakfast Club" ? five teens sent to the same room for detention because they violated school rules."Stagecoach," like "Breakfast Club," has an accepted vs. unaccepted plot. Representing the good are Gatewood, a bank president whose thievery is not known by the other passengers, and Lucy, a pious, married woman with snobbish friends. Gatewood and Lucy think they're morally superior. The bad are represented by Dallas and Doc Boone, who are both being kicked out of town by the Ladies Law and Order League.Gatewood, Lucy and Hatfield ? who boarded the coach to protect Lucy's virtue ? avoid the others. Ringo was picked up away from the town where the others boarded so he doesn't know Dallas is a whore. During the characters' travails, everyone learns that Gatewood is a selfish misanthrope and Dallas is a very good person. Lucy and Dallas bond the way that people from different backgrounds in "Breakfast Club" do.Ford was very effective in satirizing pillars of society and demolishing the stereotypes of outcasts. He brilliantly conveyed the film's ultimate lesson when Ringo didn't cancel the marriage after learning about Dallas' profession. However, his characters are too black and white. While watching the movie, I kept thinking "Stagecoach" was a trendsetter as a character portrayal, but had less depth than future films of its genre which had more multifaceted characters, better dialogue, and faster pacing. I nodded off a few times.In addition, portraying Apaches as savages who kill Americans for no reason is offensive, and Wayne can't act around females. He's great as a tough guy, but he has limited acting skills. Watch Jimmy Stewart and Wayne in "Liberty Valance" if you want to see the difference between two men's romantic acting skills.In 1939, I would have given "Stagecoach" a 10 for exploring topics that earlier adventures shunned. Today, I'm unsure what to rate it because it has been surpassed by other character portrayals. I chose 8.ZWriteP.S.: I want to give an IMDb poster named Spudnic credit for reminding me of "The Breakfast Club." I mentioned that movie in a review I wrote on "The Naked Spur" last year, but initially didn't think about it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939) directed by John Ford, and starring John Wayne as Ringo Kid didn't captivate me like I thought it would. The film is a western that involves a group of people traveling across the west for different reasons. The movie just didn't pick up fast enough for me, and I was hoping for more action sprinkled throughout. The camera shots on the other hand were gorgeous though. You could tell that the director of photography knew what he was doing. The characters didn't show enough progression for me, and John Wayne's character bored me to tears. I thoroughly enjoyed the character Doc Boone though since by the end of the film, I could understand his problems. Now, I know that a lot of people may disagree with me on this, but I must give Stagecoach (1939) a 5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Early Ford and Wayne; A Classic Western</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This landmark Western served as both the beginning of John Wayne's landmark film career and his relationship with director John Ford, who would make some of his best films with Wayne, including The Searchers. The film involves a group traveling across the desert to the town of Lordsburg. The first part of the film introduces us to the group, which includes a drunken doctor, a meek man, a prostitute with a heart of gold (Claire Trevor), the bumpkin of a driver (Andy DeVine) and the wife of a soldier. There are numerous moments of comedy here, with some working better than others. The second part of the film surrounds the trip, during which the group is attacked by Apaches in what is a breathtaking sequence filmed on location in Monument Valley, Utah. Ford would return to use this location again in his other films, since it provided such beautiful scenery. An important early film and one of the classic Westerns.Vote: 7</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Society in Microcosm</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As every film buff by now surely knows, John Ford's "Stagecoach" is credited with reinventing the western genre. It presents the society in microcosm, as a stagecoach full of traditional types (the hero, the whore, the puritan, etc.) travels across the untamed West. What maybe felt vibrant and different at the time now seems obviously schematic, but that's not really the movie's fault--it's the fault of countless film classes that have turned this film into more of a blueprint than a movie. And of course it no longer feels especially fresh, but that's because it set the pattern for nearly every western that came after.What does stand out now about Ford's film are two things: 1.) On a cerebral level, this western feels much more fraught with subtext than other movies of its era; there's a cloud of anarchy that develops over this group as they get further and further away from the civilization they know, and as their cultural judgements and labels begin to mean less and less; and 2.) On a purely cinematic level, the extended action sequence in which the stagecoach is beset by Indians is a stunner for its time, and it's terrifically exciting.This movie is also credited with making a star out of John Wayne, a crime for which I can never forgive it, no matter what its other redeeming factors are.I'm not a huge fan of westerns, so by extension I'm not a huge fan of this film. But I did enjoy it, and it's one of those movies that's fun to watch from a historical standpoint if for no other reason.Grade: B+</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>'Stagecoach' Is A Dated Snoozer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Being such a highly-rated film, I was very disappointed when I first saw this movie on VHS in the 1990s. I expected more action, for one thing, especially for a western. This film was more like a soap opera. The only action scene in this 96-minute "action-packed western" was at the end, and that looked really hokey. (Special-effects weren't the most realistic- looking in the late '30s.)Then again, loudmouth drunks always annoy me, so Thomas Mitchell's portrayal of "Doc Boone" did not enhance the viewing experience for me. Mitchell played a lot of those roles. It's pretty sad the drunk in this film was a doctor! While the film looks very dated, as a whole, we do get a bunch of stereotyped characters that have been around on film for decades, like the prostitute with the heart of gold and the crooked barker (not Bob) while the nice girl is dull. Reportedly, this film made John Wayne a star. He played "The Ringo Kid." Well, I'm glad for him; he was a fine actor.As he did with his later westerns, director John Ford gave us some nice looks at Monument Valley. That photography was the best part of this very overrated oater.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is often cited as a product of 1939, a 'super' or 'golden' year for Hollywood film making with Gone With The Wind heading a crop of 'outstanding' titles. It's doubtful whether or not any of them will stand reviving seventy years on but this one could be worse. Not surprisingly there was a French film, Boul de suif, which covers the same territory - Hollywood bomber crew confined to a coach on a journey of self discovery as much as to get from A to B. Claire Trevor is rightly top-billed but Donald Meek and Thomas Mitchell also catch the eye whilst at this remove it's difficult to see what was quite so special about Duke Wayne that it propelled him to stardom. Jack Ford turns in his usual overrated job and the time passes quickly and pleasantly enough.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ambrose Bierce Will Like STAGECOACH</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Ambrose will appreciate John Ford's eye for the American West he knew so well. Reputedly the first feature filmed in Monument Valley, this locale was virtually unchanged from Bierce's day a quarter-century earlier when STAGECOACH was shot. He'll find it a hoot that a trim-looking Lucy Mallory (Louise Platt) is able to pop out a full-term baby at the drop of a sombrero. Another bonus is that the only non-Apache character SHOWN getting fatally wounded is the infamous ex-Confederate officer, Hatfield (John Carradine). After the action he saw during the Civil War with the 9th Indiana, Ambrose will not take kindly to Hatfield's mock chivalry.TO WHOM IT MAY CONCERN: The body of noted American author (An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge) Ambrose Bierce, born June 24, 1842, recently was discovered in total cryogenic hibernation at the back of a Central American warehouse. Bierce is expected to be fully defrosted by late 2049 or early 2050. Based on my 85 previously posted IMDb comments and background in Bierce studies, the author's guardians have commissioned me to review a periodically updated list of films to help guide his future leisure pursuits, with the provision that my comments also be made available to the general public.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Best Western Ever Made in 1939; Still Stands Tall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Almost anyone my age has seen STAGECOACH between 20 and 50 times. First, it was a smash hit in 1939 when I was still in the crib; second, it was re-issued more than once. The third reason is it was the shining diamond in the very first batch of major American made movies to be sold to television. It appeared on Million Dollar Movie, then it was televised over, and over, and over again.This movie is so solid in its classic storytelling, excellent direction and exquisite acting that it stands the test of multiple viewings. Just try watching the first 3 minutes (or any 3 minutes) and there's no way you'll tune it out. STAGECOACH is John Ford's greatest western (not THE SEARCHERS, which is excellent but pales in comparison). STAGECOACH will still be a classic long after everyone living in 2007 is planted in the ground.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Curious Characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching Stagecoach I was fairly forgiving of the somewhat forced and awkward moments stemming from the rather exaggerated stereotypes of the characters. Granted, one cannot deny the stunning visual scope of this film, which is yet another great epic from the magical year of American cinema, 1939. However, when the Apaches attack and the Carradine character Hatfield decides to commit suicide I was confused as to his motivations. Was he a coward, or was this somehow a heroic gesture? Was it meant as some kind of allegorical statement about the final end of the Old South in light of the future of the Union? Did he kill himself to be spared death by an arrow or anticipated torture? If so, then what of his previous chivalry towards Mrs. Mallory, wouldn't he want to stay around to protect her, or did he figure his job was over since the Calvary arrived? This still does not make sense to me. Did I miss something here? Maybe I will watch it again. After that, I started to be more picky about the rest of the apparent inconsistencies and exaggerations. The doctor who goes from a totally irresponsible drunk to philosophical seriousness was a bit farfetched at times, but played masterfully. All of the potential criticisms, and there could be many, are forgivable in light of the spirit of the times. I have noticed this same tendency toward stereotypical and almost allegorical characters in other films of that year, "Union Pacific", for example. Generally, the power of the cinematic vision outweighs the particular flaws. In those pioneering times the vision quest and the big picture of the big picture takes precedence over attention to minute psychological detail. This would later be corrected and our standards of a great classic, or great directing, would become somewhat more demanding in that regard. Oftentimes a pioneering classic both breaks new ground, and yet, of necessity (in order to get made at all) leaves behind the evidence of its growing pains.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Idiotic and Tiresome Cartoon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Stagecoach (1939) I have long heard about how great this film was so I finally purchased it and watched it. Starting out, I was startled at how stupid, meaningless and moronic it was. It was like watching a depression era Cartoon. Presented are a bunch of idiotic, tiresome, "civilized" people chatting about nothing in particular. Once they get on the Stagecoach it's no better, their self-righteous attitude, which comes across in the director's and script writers' intents, are much to stomach. You have a prejudiced, aristocratic dandy (John Carradine), a dumb as nails loner (John Wayne), a gullible, understanding prostitute, a vile corrupt banker, a smug small-minded "preacher", an inane drunk doctor, an annoying sanctimonious "lady" (who is pregnant) and a few other dimwits, all riding on the Stagecoach, ever fearful of the "evil Indian" attack. They talk about the most frivolous rubbish ever imagined. All of the characters are entirely irksome. Scenes proceed from A to B without any story, good dialogue or interest.The Apache are played by Navajo Indians (or a Mexican woman in ranch scene) in close ups and by blatant white stunt men in the horse shots. Of course, as expected, since this is filmed by a virulent, white bigoted Director, financed by a greedy studio and written by calloused short-sighted, studio stable script writers, it is no surprise that the Apache are played off as a hostile threat to the grand white civilized lifestyle (if you have a brain, you will observe that the 'grand white civilized lifestyle' is nothing but a bunch of loathing drunks who shoot each other). You will notice that the Apache are so inept that they can't even stop a Stagecoach, and are shot by the rabble riding in said Stagecoach, who never run out of bullets and put down about 55 of the attacking Apache in one of the most shallow, impalpable scenes ever imagined. If you are wondering how the Apache stopped Stagecoaches, all they had to do was shoot one horse. The Apache, by that time, having been reduced to being a poor starving band of corralled slaves, imprisoned, murdered by the US government and it's hostile citizens, were fighting for survival at that point. Instead, they are called "savages" and made to resemble sub-human scum. Having lived with the Apache myself, I realize that they have a rich culture, are deeply spiritual and had a love for their land.If you can get past all the inept portrayals and ostensible characters, which if you are intelligent, is impossible to forgive, then at least you can enjoy a narrative but Stagecoach lacks that as well. John Ford doesn't even give us a palpable story. All that is left is cheap 1930's gimmicky cutouts, as John Wayne instantly falls in love with ostracized prostitute, kills all bad guys, then everything is fine.After Stagecoach (1939) was over I was left questioning all the misleading "great" reviews. I burned my copy as it has no value whatsoever, not even as average entertainment.Stagecoach goes nowhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much overrated Ford film...time has not been kind to it...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The word "stereotypes" can be applied to every stock character in this story of a dangerous trek across Apache territory that has so many climactic moments that it seems as though the writers didn't know when or how to finish the story. John Ford made many great westerns and all of them had more finesse than this bloated tale whose main virtue is that it introduces John Wayne in his first star-making role as the Ringo Kid. Wayne's scenes with Claire Trevor give the film an intimacy that is somewhat lacking elsewhere despite the claustrophobic closeness of the passengers on the coach.The cliches are in the characterizations: the prostitute with a heart of gold, the drunken town doctor, the squeaky-voiced coach driver for comic relief, the "good woman" (played by the bland Louise Platt), the crooked banker, the timid salesman--all of whom are played to the hilt by the cast in the style of acting rampant in the '30s.The big set piece of the story is the Indian attack toward the end--after a lot of hokey storytelling attempts to flesh out the characters--and it's a stunning and lengthy assault worthy of a much more important work of the director. STAGECOACH is probably the film that started all the western cliches--but time has not been kind to it. Among the performances, aside from John Wayne the best are Claire Trevor, John Carradine (as a nice man for a change) and Tim Holt in a brief but well played bit role. Thomas Mitchell's drunken doctor gets to be a bit of a bore along the way. (I was more impressed by his Gerald O'Hara in GWTW that same year). Donald Meek does his usual timid act and Louise Platt makes almost no impression as the good woman. Andy Devine is super annoying as the comic relief. Tom Tyler does a nice bit as the villain in one of the film's best anti-climactic moments (of which there are many!!)Other John Ford westerns using Monument Valley backgrounds were far superior to STAGECOACH and far more subtle in getting their effects than this one. Personally, I find it vastly overrated with stock company acting ruining much of the proceedings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.This one film is perhaps the lead pebble that divides the great waters of film appreciation. To the left go watchers that just want high quality amusement. To the right go those for whom film is part of building a life. Film as entertainment; film as art.The conventional story is that John Ford brought the majesty of the west to the then moribund western (and thus helping to redefine America); that he helped merge the mainstream conventions of theater with still newly emerging cinematic ones, and that he introduced (with John Wayne) a new rhythm in reading lines -- in fact a whole new posture to performance.Probably so. This project mixes hackneyed conventions of theater (the group of stereotypes cast together) with cinematic contrasts: the confinement of the stage, the quiet of the town (with power lines in the background!), the motion of the openness. No one is evil in this world, only "otherly motivated." Nearly all that matters is better at the end than at the beginning.I see what he has done. I understand its importance. I still think it is banal, lowbrow, condescending. Ford opened the camera up, but didn't exploit that space. That would come with Orson Welles, who studied "Stagecoach" obsessively.Ford introduced a new pace in Wayne's dialog, and he was in this case smart enough to know what he did. But Wayne himself was too plain stupid and unskilled to know what to do with it. That would have to wait for Brando, and then Wayne could follow in his later projects.Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The more film diversity I explore, the less I like the role models held up by the public ('Star Wars', 'The Matrix'). If the average IMDb writer spends at least 10 hours per week watching TV or film, they better be learning something or they're just wasting their time. Simple entertainment alone doesn't make anything worthwhile.Any film has potential to be great, but often times it gets mucked up by some idiot without a deeper purpose. Hence a "dud" is born. Sometimes duds result from time acting against the politics of a film. Does this mean everyone must watch 'Death Becomes Her' and 'Empire of the Sun'? No. Here's one role model from John Ford. The man only showed promise when he made propaganda during World War II. His Westerns, by today's standards, are so simple to make one vomit. Zinnemann and Peckinpah took the genre further by tweaking the story and settings, not the characters.The characters here are stereotypes we've seen in 'Breakfast Club' to 'Usual Suspects'. They are the social stereotypes as opposed to the war, comedy, or crime stereotypes. They act as we expect, modern filmgoers are smarter than the viewers of films in the 30s, but they put up with more rubbish than before.Black and white is such a lucrative trait. As a filmmaker and photographer, I can say that it can add mood to scenes in ways that no other color tweaking can do. Many films in the 30s and 40s to great extremes, from film noir to 'King Kong'. Alas, 'Stagecoach' is shot in B&amp;W because color film was too expensive. The setting isn't helped and John Wayne makes his macho debut. American kids in the 50s and 60s then suffered from his baloney that wrecked their critical thought. From Wayne to Davy Crockett, so it goes...Overall, for good black and white, stick with 'Elephant Man' since a real artist was in charge of that.Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While I like other Wayne and Ford movies... this is unwatchable. This is my 2nd try. I cannot imagine why people would offer a rave for this except if ones sense organs weres shut off completely and the movie was evaluated abstractly; i.e. the movie that produced all the clichés of the western must deserve some special praise. But the praise is one level removed - a viewer has to ignore the natural tedium that pungently outdated ideas smother you with, and endure cliché after cliché accumulating. Sure they weren't clichés at the time, but they're the dry, crusty ancestors of clichés now. As entertainment, this is quite unwatchable.You could play "Memes of the 1930's" Bingo watching this. Hooker with a heart of gold? Check! Unconvincing exterior gun-fight shot INSIDE a studio? Yep.As always in 1930s movies, the score mercilessly pounds one theme into your brain over, and over, and over, and over, and over. I find I can only go back to about 1939 in terms of film viewership before I can't detect a representation of the world commensurate with modern ideas &amp; values.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Unfortunately, this is just another of those John Wayne/John Ford Westerns with no difference to any of the others, or any basis in historical facts. It is just another rewrite of American history, nothing like what actually happened, or what would have happened. The truth is that the Settlers almost completely exterminated the Native American race, yet in this film they portray the Indians as the bad guys, and the happy settlers as the good guys. Again. Has anyone noticed by the way that most of the characters are good upstanding citizens and helpless women? There is a priest, a banker and a blind woman, the first two of which are killed senselessly by the Indians, the directors using every Disney-like sentimental technique in the book. On the other hand, the baddies (or Native Americans, is there a difference?) are portrayed as being brutal, savage, stupid and pretty basically quite evil compared to the Whites.If you want to see a good, original movie about what really happened, I suggest you see Dances With Wolves. Thank God they don't make films like this anymore.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...and how unfortunate that is! John Ford's classic western film - complete with revoltingly fake background scenery (typical of 1939), horrible over-dramatization of pretty much everything in the movie, and acting that would make Pamela Anderson cringe. There are more mistakes in the movie than I could possible mention. Also, I would also not like to take the time to watch it again and keep a record. This movie had two redeeming qualities (as I see it.) The first is the suave and not-half-bad John Carradine. Unfortunately, his character never gets developed and has no purpose outside of being an extra for Wayne. The second one was that this was one of John Wayne's earlier films, and he hadn't yet evolved his character (as he only ever played one) into the pompous and overbearing man that he would become in the 50's and remain until his final picture. He was still the basis for the picture, though. His stardom was the main draw. God knows that the plot wasn't. John Wayne is no Gary Oldman, but at least a little character diversity would have been nice. John Ford was no Stanley Kubrick, or even a Sergio Leone, but at least the tiniest eye for detail and art would have made all the difference in the world. I gave this movie a 3 out of the sheer goodness of my heart.</fullReview>
