		<shortDescription>Least Horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have a confession to make.....in August 1974 I re-opened an old cinema and this was the premiere attraction. The sound gargled away from behind the flabby screen and the invited audience sat on the lumpy seats. I looked like Top Cat in a tuxedo, and this film unfolded across the joins on our cinemascope presentation. What a night! Unforgettable in its mangy charm and an intro into the glamorous world of second rate showbiz to which I am still magnetized today. As a result I have a special place in my heart for this gloriously awful musical. All I can say was that the opening night crowd fled into the darkness after the last reel flapped off the projector. Some even promised to return and asked what was on next week: "MAME ...with Lucy" I grinned as I locked the door. Somehow the business survived and I even got to showcase AT LONG LAST LOVE the next year. LOST HORIZON was quite successful in Australia and was first released in Sydney as presented in 70mm for 13 weeks.... families liked it and for a while it was considered the sort of Brady Bunch family sort of musical. I just wanted to open my crummy seaside cinema with something nice. So I did and thank Neptune the locals forgave me. I deliciously look forward to the DVD release with the infamous deleted scenes, especially the legendary diaper dance with the guys swinging teapots and extended versions of Bobby Van leaping about with Liv Ullman. Am I correct in believing this was Ross Hunter's last production?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Lost on the Right Audience</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While the songs and dance numbers, in general, aren't as strong as many would have them be, the film's storyline and message are still there and ring out loudly above the simple 70s-style musical numbers. Keeping in mind that this film was made after the Hollywood Musical had nearly died out (with few exceptions being rock musicals), the audiences that went to see it new didn't appreciate the fact that it was a brave attempt at something that hadn't been done to date. Audiences that see it today will tend to judge it against the films and musicals of today and, perhaps, the huge all-star casts of musicals gone past. But to do that to this film, or any for that matter, is an injustice to the film itself.There are some good musical moments in the film. The first is that of Bobby Van. Mr. Van took his role of Harry Lovett just after closing a 2 year Tony nominated (for best actor) run of the Broadway revival, "No, No, Nanette." He is a song-and-dance-man from way back and, honestly, the only one in the cast that was truly talented and experienced for musicals. He never misses a step in his "Question Me An Answer" and rightly so ... he was totally at home as Harry. Other pleasant numbers are done by Olivia Hussey when she welcomes the new visitors and while the lyrics are weak, James Shigeta shows his strong voice in the "Family" song, as well as a nicely done staging of the full piece.View the film for what it is ... a fantasy about a place where you never grow old, hidden in the ice and snow covered mountains of Tibet, found by a group of unsuspecting modern-day people wrapped up in the strife of any modern culture. Take this and compare it to reality and you get a film that falls short of a goal. But ... take this film for the message of love and peace and tranquility and brotherly love and you get a warm and refreshing message and a positive one at that.To some this film may seem corny to others a welcomed release from the hectic pace of reality. To the first, try to not judge and just enjoy the message. To the second, you have discovered the secret of Shangri-La!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why isn't this movie on DVD?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Much better than it is generally given credit for, this version of "Lost Horizon" not only had great music and beautiful scenery, but also some stunning mountain photography. A special edition laser disc was released some years ago which added more than 30 minutes of previously deleted material, extra music, and lots of bonus material. So why isn't this on DVD?! Hard to figure the studios out sometimes. Certainly the roles could have been given to people who could sing better than Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, George Kennedy and Sally Kellerman, but what do you want in a movie, good acting or melodious pipes? Song and dance man Bobby Van is great fun, Michael York is a suitably tragic villain, and seeing Sir John Gielgud decked out as Chang may sound silly but actually works very well on screen. Trust me, you need to check this movie out - if you can find it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Those Dancing Fools</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As Bette Midler used to say, "I never miss a Liv Ullman musical". Here is a film which attempts to inspire and uplift, and I guess it succeeds, if for reasons quite different from those intended.Unless they attempt a musical version of "Schindler's List" this will probably be the all time champion in the "Play it straight" stakes. James Hilton's novella, heaven knows, was a piece of fluff which tantalised rather than explored its themes. The 1937 film was a winner because, hey, what Frank Capra film in the '30s wasn't?But if we had to have a musical version, wouldn't it have been a good idea to hire a couple of musical stars?! Okay, at a push Bobby Van passes muster, and thank God that he's meant to be that annoying, because after five minutes the idea of him being lost in a snowdrift seemed eminently satisfying. But as for the rest - George Kennedy, Peter Finch, Sally Kellermann, John Gielgud, Olivia Hussey - well we aren't going to see them in a revival of "42nd Street" now are we? My favourite definitely has to be Kellermann and Hussey thumping around a library, the former looking bored, the latter very pregnant, singing what seems to be a 70s New Age version of the "Green Acres" theme.But its Liv who suffers most. Swinging those bovine limbs of hers, singing some nonsense about the world being a circle which never ends - an apt description of the song - she seems light years away from Bergman. Actually she bears a striking resemblance to Bill Clinton in some of her long shots.Only Michael York emerges with any credibilty. And that's mainly because his character keeps nagging everybody to run away. And who could blame him?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The "director's" version was better, but ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 19 or 20, years old at the time and living in Salt Lake City, Utah and I still remember the new dome theater, called the century 21. Layback chairs that rocked and a new sound system, large screen and huge open space between the screen and the packed theater. We felt all the excitement of a new preview screening of a film. Ta da da daa da ta da dada dada... I can still hear the opening music ringing trumpet and the crash of cymbals. I loved the interplay of characters and the filmed vistas. I know Peter Finch and Luv and Sally had some trouble with the lip-sink but hey, this was a feel good, go feel better about things film! What I regret is the way they cut the meaningful heart out of it, showed the cut version and then called it a flop. I saw the cut version and I can see it lost its view of the vision it had in the preview edition. Yes I wince a bit at Peter's effort to make love through music but, you know I didn't see it that way when I left the theater. when they surveyed us as we left I regret any comment I made that may have altered the original. I liked it then and still see it while I listen to the music on my LP. Most of my family has heard me sing much of the sound track and I can use the films monologues in our games of "what movie is this". I wish a director's cut on DVD was available. It is available on VHS but its not quite the same. I would particularly like a full serious lord of the rings style commentary about its origins, struggles and triumphs. Picky people should leave things well enough alone. Bring it back!!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A huge cast gathered for this remake which sadly was a box office failure notwithstanding a great sound track. I can't say it was riveting entertainment, nor a cure for insomnia. Nevertheless I enjoyed the film - it provided the escape I was after one afternoon. A good look for those of us looking for the ideal life, albeit a fantasy. Expect some corny moments, few thrills, and an occasional laugh.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>What "so bad it's good" really means!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Usually when a film is hailed as the above description, it has to be considered watchable enough to enjoy the film's ineptitude. Some films like this are bad, but to watch them would be asking a whole lot of the viewer. LOST HORIZON certainly does not fit that last description because while CITIZEN KANE it is not, it certainly does not deserve to be trashed.By the time LOST HORIZON came along, the movie musical was already considered a dead genre, save for the occasional import from Broadway that actually turned out well (OLIVER! &amp; CABARET come immediately to mind). However, the age of the musical where songs were written especially for the movie had long been buried. That did not matter to producer Ross Hunter, who always was a safeguard of Old Hollywood even after the advent of the MPAA allowed for movies to be made of subjects that the studios would not have touched with a ten-foot pole. Hunter may have succeeded in bringing back old-fashioned soap operas with the Douglas Sirk movies, but as THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE showed with its original songs that paled in comparison to the classics it stood alongside (well, almost), the musical was perhaps not a genre in need of a revival.You certainly could have fooled Hunter, who went full-steam ahead with his musicalization of a property that should have been left alone to begin with. Casting actors with little to no musical training &amp; badly dubbing them was bad enough, but choosing a project that worked best in its original format was double trouble. That is certainly not to fault Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David's music, which is fine enough, though certainly not up to par with their Dionne Warwick spectaculars. But you get the idea that maybe even they were doubtful of this project's bankability. Supposedly the film led to the break-up of their previously infallible partnership, as well as Hunter's film career (he mostly worked for TV afterwards).Apparently, Hollywood likes to keep its megaflops very secret because LOST HORIZON has not been seen much since its theatrical debut, and has not even made it onto VHS, let alone DVD in the U.S. (I found my copy courtesy of eBay). But if even Ed Wood's hilariously bad movies can be released &amp; enjoyed by people even for all the wrong reasons, then certainly LOST HORIZON can. So I hope that Columbia Pictures can find it in their hearts to bring this movie back into circulation so we can enjoy it (even genuinely because it appears some people actually did). Heck, if only for the camp value, it would be a surefire hit. With CHICAGO &amp; MOULIN ROUGE having indicated the musical is making a comeback, then it would be good to have LOST HORIZON out on the market again to educate people in how not to make one. But it sure is hell of a lot of fun along the way.</fullReview>

For the first time in years I'm seeing and hearing where these rediculous tunes from my youth have come from - and loved it. John Geilgud's perpetual grin and his pointy-head costumes had me in stitches. Not to mention some truly silly dance numbers AND a cast including actor extraordinaire George Kennedy!

		<shortDescription>What's everyone complaining about?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't see that much wrong with this movie. Granted, the principal singers might not be Luciano Pavarotti and Maria Callas, but they can certainly carry a tune. Burt Bacharach and Hal David are talented songwriters and I happen to love their songs, especially "The World Is A Circle", "The Things That I Will Not Miss", and "Question Me An Answer". Some people claim that Hermes Pan's choreography is ghastly and that the snowy mountain sets look as if they were made of plastic; I disagree on both counts. I've seen powdered snow before and the snow in those mountain scenes looked realistic to me. And most of all, in this film's defense, it is appropriate for a family audience (at least I remember it being that way when I saw it on Christmas Day a few years ago.) With all the outcry over sex and violence in the cinema these days, I find it refreshing to note that this film deserves its G-rating. And they don't say that naughty "F" word every ten minutes like some films I've seen. Thank God. So although this film may not be everyone's cup of tea, it does have some redeeming value and I give it ten points out of a possible ten. That's my story and I'm sticking to it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Deadly-earnest camp musical; often deliriously enjoyable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ross Hunter's musical remake of the 1937 fantasy, based on James Hilton's enduring bestseller, was written off by critics and audiences almost immediately in 1973, sounding off a backlash against musicals in general that gave the genre a bad reputation in Hollywood for decades. Group of disparate British and American individuals end up on an emergency flight out of a war-torn Asian country, but their plane is hijacked and crashes in a snowy mountain terrain; a rescue party arrives and leads the group to an isolated community called Shangri-La, where the sun is always shining and most of the residents are youthful and blissfully content. Some of the performances by the classy cast aren't so classy (the effervescent mood of the piece, the lilting Burt Bacharach-Hal David tunes, as well as the lightweight direction all conspire to make the performers look just a bit silly). Peter Finch is the international peace keeper who becomes involved in a somewhat constipated romance with resident Liv Ullmann; Sally Kellerman is a malcontent photographer who spits out lines like, "I got tired of taking pictures of people with their heads blown off, so that people with their heads STILL ON--and usually under hairdryers--could get one last kick before turning to the nearest recipe"; John Gieguld, "as Chang", is curiously cast as an Asian factotum for the High Lama who learned to speak English while attending Oxford (but why no songs for Chang?); while Bobby Van, as a USO entertainer, soft-shoes his way into the hearts of the Shangri-La schoolchildren. Hal David's nonsensical lyrics are sometimes jaw-dropping, and the pacing gets bogged down with all that talk about the outside world and how nothing is more pitiful today. However, the production is lush and the general handling strangely affecting. The two-dimensional characters are so overly serious they actually become endearing, and the movie's silliness is infectious. It ends up being a lot of fun. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Possibilities</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To remake "Lost Horizon", as a musical, the need for a Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein or Lerner &amp; Lowe type musical composition was needed. Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the wrong choice. Having said that, my favorite thing about "Lost Horizon", is its score. It's just that the score doesn't fit the piece. The cast, is made-up of mostly non-musical talents (Ullman, Finch and Hussey, were all dubbed, and still don't sound all that great).Frankly, the novella, on which this, and the earlier non-musical film versions were based, is mediocre, at best. While the possibilities for a truly good, cinematic musical version exist, they are not realized here. The film succeeds at being a good, rainy-day vehicle, to pass the time. Otherwise, you are better off, buying the CD of its soundtrack. Only recommended as a curiosity piece, due to the film's awful reputation. I've seen much better; but I've seen MUCH worse.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Himalayan "Springtime for Hitler"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are two groups of people in the world: those who love this 1973 remake of "Lost Horizon" and those who are lucky to escape with their lives if caught in a theater with a majority from the first group. There is no in between. Either you accept polar bears rumbling about the Himalayas and designer caps propped jauntily aside the head during treks at the Roof of the World, or you don't. The classic "Lost Horizon" asked the viewer to suspend belief in the hope of something better. This "Lost Horizon" makes the viewer appreciate what he's already got... no clubfooted school teachers snaking about with obnoxious children; no litter-lugging sherpas chanting "living together, loving together" to a couple undoubtedly more anxious to get on with the latter than the former; and no English lords moonlighting as high lamas.Do not let anyone persuade you not to see this movie. Like wearing purple and eating more ice cream than beans, it is a required rite of passage before leaving this veil of tears. Which, I guarantee you will have in abundance, no matter into which of the two groups you fall.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I went to the cinema in 1973 when the film was released, I was 11 at the time. I remember how much I enjoyed it and wanted to live in Shangri-la, that's how naive and young I was. I recently came across a video of the film I had recorded off television some years ago. I watched it again and am not ashamed to admit I still enjoy it as much now as I did 29 years ago. I also enjoy listening to the words of the songs, because it makes me think that one day we could live in a place where the sound of guns don't pound in our ears and if we look at our reflection - we should be happy with what we see. This is what I call a "feel good" film because I feel happy after watching it. Maybe I am still naive but it makes me happy and I'm sure it will make you happy if you watch it with an open mind and enjoy it for what it is - a good, family film. I must be one of the few people who has this film on VHS PAL video - and DVD (self-made). I recorded it on DVD as the videotape recording from TV was starting to wear thin. I still watch it from time to time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I Love This Train Wreck of a Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Spoiler Alert The first half of this movie will fool you. You have been warned. It starts out with the attempts of a peace ambassador to evacuate refugees from an airport, which is actually fairly interesting. The attempt fails, and the only people to escape are the ambassador, two journalists, a contractor, and a freakin' stand up comic. The plane is hijacked, and they crash in the mountains. A fur-clad rescue party shows up and escorts the survivors back to Shangri-La, and that's when the movie slips you a hit of acid. Everyone there sings and breaks into pathetically choreographed dance numbers at the drop of a hat. The music is (how should I put this?) instantly forgettable -- except "The World Is a Circle", the chorus of which may stick in your brain like a tumor if you aren't careful. Poor Sally Kellerman. She looked miserable whenever she had to sing, and terrified when she had to dance. The Twist she did while singing to George Kennedy was truly cringe-worthy. (I told you the songs were forgettable-- I've seen this 50 times and still can't remember what she was singing.) George Kennedy was spared the indignity of singing or dancing. Lucky him. Liv Ullman seemed just as uncomfortable trying to dance, so they let her off the hook by allowing her to sway around awkwardly while trying to keep a serene smile plastered to her face. I think they should have made her dance like Sally -- it's no fair for the director to play favorites in a film like this. And Bobby Van! Words cannot describe the prancing about this man does; you have to see it to believe it. Maybe I'm giving away too much here (no I'm not), but I was glad when Michael York died at the end. I was tired of his incessant whining about wanting to go home. Why the fuss? I'd be willing to put up with the singing and the goofy clothes to spend the rest of my life in a place with no traffic, pesky jobs or the IRS. Thoroughly misguided and miscast, it is a wonderful example of how not to make a musical, which is why I love it so. So take some prescription painkillers (they'll help!), grab a pillow to prevent a laughter hernia, and watch this disaster unfold.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Two words. GOD AWFUL</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>(Warning, there are spoilers sprinkled throughout, but I wouldn't worry)There is only one movie I have seen that is worse than this one. "Howling: New Moon Rising". This film is an utter waste of celluloid. How such a large cast of decent actors could be so totally wasted is incredible. The really amazing thing is that some of the cast still managed to keep their careers going. Michael York is the only cast member who adds any credibility to his role. In his final BIG scene, after Olivia Hussey's character ages before his eyes he begins to cry (Or he has a severe stomach cramp, I haven't decided which) and then he runs screaming off a cliff. I'm not sure if it was from the agony over losing the love of his life, or if he suddenly realized how far down the crapper this movie was going to send his career and decided to cease the humiliation. George Kennedy plays the same role he does in every movie, which is O.K., but he is dragged down by the terrible script. Sally Kellerman shows she has no shame, Bobby Van and Olivia Hussey more than likely needed the money, and John Geilgud and Liv Ullman look like they'd rather be somewhere else.What really bothers me is that we are supposed to view York's character as the *sshole because he wants to leave. Now let's think this over. His character is supposed to cut off all ties to the outside world for what? So he can live for hundreds of years and be forced to listen to Kennedy and Kellerman duet and Bobby Van tapdance and sing? Who could blame him for wanting to leave?The movie starts out with promise, It's a fairly strong cast, and a fairly good plot. then the filmmakers decided that it needed to be a musical. That alone is terrible, but they hired BURT BACHARACH to write the music. THAT is an abomination. Not only do the songs pop up in the least likely of places (Well, except for Hussey's song during dinner. I can suspend my disbelief for that one) But the songs are so swinging 70's that the movie became dated almost before it reached the theaters (And it bombed at the box office. It cost 6 million to make and only got 3 million from U.S. Moviegoers, and probably 99% of them wanted their money back.)Trust me, avoid this movie like the plague. It honestly is awful. I just can't believe I wasted two and a half hours of my time watching this when I could have done something constructive, like organize my sock drawer.0/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This musical has a deep meaning which is appreciated by only a few. The wise can see the wisdom contained in what most call folly.This music may well regain popularity as world consciousness rises. It is about a land "far away from it all" where "living things have room to grow." Its people are "living and growing together" mentally and spiritually faster than in biological age.The lyrics help us recognize the relativity of this "world that is spinning around" and to "look inside yourself; that is where the Truth always lies." The absolute level of consciousness is more real than the ever changing world of the senses.I have been searching for the video for years . When I find it, or it comes out in DVD, it will help "share the joy" of being in "Shangri-la" again. Burt Bacharach's music and Hal David's lyrics made a masterpiece in turbulent times that is just now ready to be fully appreciated.May this CD inspire you to find your own "Lost Horizon" or recognize it when "peace of mind" has found you. - LostHorizon.org</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not a great, but it's watchable - kind of</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical remake of 'Lost Horizon' has been almost uniformly panned over the years and has long been unavailable on home video. So is it really that bad? Comparisons with the 1937 Ronald Colman classic aside, this Bacharach-David musical starts as an adventure story and only moves into song and dance fantasy about 45 minutes into the film, when the mixed bag of plane crash survivors (Peter Finch, Michael York, Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy, Bobby Van) discover Shangri-La, led by Oxford graduate Chang (John Gielgud) and the High Lama (Charles Boyer).So the cast looks strong - and in Shangri-La is boosted by wimpy Olivia Hussey and pouty Liv Ullmann. But aside from Van there's no one with experience of musicals. More of that later.The songs are not that memorable, aside from the melody which first introduces the fantasy village up in the mountains. The staging of musical numbers, by Fred Astaire's associate Hermes Pan, aren't that fascinating. However, there is still enough here to keep you watching: but whether it is from the impulse to watch a real turkey unfolding or from a need to watch the story to the end, I'm not sure.I wouldn't really class this as a musical; there are too few songs. And Finch in particular is wasted in this although he plays his part dead straight.The remake of Lost Horizon is a misfire, but not completely awful. Some criticisms of this film are justified, but by no means all. Give it a go and make up your own mind.</fullReview>

Making a musical version of Hilton's tale is a welcome change from a plodding re-make. We see seasoned actors who add real depth to the emotional content and significance of each scene. I cannot agree with the critics who overlooked this scintillating gem of a film. It is a treasure of the silver screen!

		<shortDescription>True high-budget schlock</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was an extra on this film, in the part shot at the airport in the first 15 minutes or so; I was one of the fleeing (mostly Mexican) Bangladeshi refugees running across the runways at Ryan Field in Tucson. At one point, standing around in our turbans as we waited for another shot, one of my fellow extras turned to me asked me what the move was going to be about. I told him it was going to be a remake of Lost Horizons, only as a musical. There was a long pause, then he replied: "Man, this movie is gonna suck". Pretty perceptive of him, I thought. I had a good time and made a bit of money, but even with some interesting personal memories attached to this movie I can't sit through the whole thing. If you ever saw the movie "The Swarm", you can pretty much get the idea. You get to see a lot of famous and talented people wasted on an an idea that on the face of it is just BAD. The idea seemed to be that if you throw enough money at a movie and hire enough big names, then a good story and good writing aren't necessary. Just turn the big crank, and out comes the product. It's just not worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Take another look</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As a film buff, I obviously had read all the excruciating reviews and funny, sarcastic comments about this film (my favourite being Woody Allen's quip "If I had my life to live over again I wouldn't change anything ... except for seeing the musical remake of Lost Horizon"). Therefore I've never been able to watch it without smirking at the choreography/set/songs etc. Just recently I came across a widescreen DVD and watched it for the first time in years, along with a friend who had never heard of the film's reputation. HE really enjoyed it, and - after trying to block out all the negative prejudices I obviously had about the film - so did I. There is nothing especially bad about Lost Horizon, and it is far more enjoyable and watchable than many other early 1970's movies. It isn't even especially camp. The lyrics to some of the songs are rather repetitive and simplistic, but this isn't really apparent when hearing them for the first time or having the flaws pointed out in advance so you are ready to scoff at them. As for all the reviewers who claimed the cast cannot sing in tune, this criticism falls apart since Liv Ullmann, Olivia Hussey and Peter Finch were dubbed (brilliantly too, as the vocals match their speaking voices perfectly), and Sally Kellerman has a really lovely and totally unique singing style. Vocally, Kellerman's duet with Olivia Hussey on "The Things I Will Not Miss" is excellent. Special mention should be made of the legendary Hollywood star Charles Boyer's brilliant performance as the High Lama - and his comments about mankind destroying itself are chillingly apt to today's fractured world. I wouldn't claim for a second that Lost Horizon is a masterpiece (The things I wouldn't miss about it are the uninspired choreography, and Bobby Van's "Question Me An Answer" number, which could easily have been cut), but if you haven't ever seen Lost Horizon, or haven't seen it for some time, try watching without that "Oh boy, let's have a laugh at this pile of junk" attitude, and you will be surprised at how enjoyable it actually is.</fullReview>

We watched and sang along with it, like it was a new religion. Of all the movies I've seen I'd have to say, that "Lost Horizon" (1973) was and still is the most memorable. Yes, some of the actors performing their musical numbers was "cheesy", ie. Sally Kellerman, George Kennedy, but the music score was and is, still phenomenal. The soundtrack is a must have for anyone who is capable of stepping out of today's mindset, of the dark and dismal, and yearns for a feel good experience, even if it only lasts as long as the soundtrack does. The film and the soundtrack will continue to be number one on my list of movie's that, won't let go of me. This film is up there with "The Goodbye Girl"(original with Marsha Mason) and "Steel Magnolia's". Just my opinion...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie has fans?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I won't change anyone's minds with this post. A lot of people who are fans of musicals- especially classics like "Singin in the Rain" and "My Fair Lady"- disdain this musical version of "Lost Horizon" because it is an anti-musical. Unlike Arthur Freed, who produced (and co-wrote the songs for) many classic musicals at MGM, producer Ross Hunter hired mostly non-singers and non-dancers to sing and dance. First mistake. Then he gave the actors a script that was a watered-down version of the original. Second mistake. Then he hired a highly-competent British director, but one who had never directed a musical before, to helm it. Third mistake. And so on and so on. Yet the passion displayed by posters on the message boards here suggests that not everyone is put off by the shortcomings of this wretched big-budget movie that plays more like a TV musical. Too bad you supporters weren't around when it first hit the big screen. You might have saved LH from becoming what one critic called "Lost Investments".Even if you do like this film, you must admit that there had to be some validity to the criticism. Burt Bacharach and Hal David, who respectively wrote the music and lyrics for this epic, never worked together again, even after years of success. The question is- who talked who into taking the money to write songs like "Question Me An Answer"? I'm guessing that is what the post-release estrangement was all about. Why don't you LH fans see a real musical from the classic period of the 30s to the 50s, when they were made by pros who knew how to "put on a show"? Check out "On the Town", or any of the Astaire-Rogers musicals. That way, even if seeing them doesn't change your opinion about one of the only disaster films of the 70s not produced by Irwin Allen, you'll at least understand why this "forgotten" film holds up so badly when placed along side one of the real classics mentioned above.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film so bad it actually hurts to watch</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The musical remake of "Lost Horizon" is truly one of the worst films ever made. What makes it so exceptionally awful is that so much genuine talent was assembled to create this Stinker. Take away the music and you have a servicable Technicolor remake of a moody classic. Yes, there's lots of dopey dialogue and some silliness like polar bears in the Himalayas. But it's pretty to look at and Peter Finch is a commanding presence. But Lo! Now cometh a collection of Bacharach-David tunes so hopelessly out of place that every song causes an audience reaction reminiscent of the play-goers in "Springtime for Hitler." It hurts to watch. And hurts worse to listen. The Kellerman-Kennedy duet will make your skin break out. And that goofy "Living Together" number is the only thing keeping "The World is a Circle" from being the most painful five minutes any film watcher could ever sustain. Films such as "Plan Nine from Outer Space" are generally regarded as the industry's worst. But considering the Academy Award talent and big-studio budget behind "Lost Horizon" it stands (more probably stoops) as two of the most horrific hours ever birthed by Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Something's shining in the (lost) horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I watched this movie some years ago, and it's still hard to get some of the songs out of my head. "The World is a Circle" and "The Things I Will Not Miss" are two of the strongest of the musical numbers supplied by Bacharach/David, and both have choruses that will stick with you like flypaper. Unfortunately both these and the other songs are victims of very poor choreography, as pointed out by many of the other people here who have commented on the movie. Especially the Sally Kellerman song by the pond, towards the end of the movie, will make you cringe and wish she would just slip on a rock and fall in instead of moving her hips about like that. One of the all time masters of choreography, Hermes Pan (Pal Joey, My Fair Lady, Top Hat), seems to be at a total loss as what to do with the music he has been provided. It must have been way too hip and pop music-like for him at the time to fully understand and appreciate it, as this was quite late in his career and he was an old chap at the time. Most of his best movie musical efforts were made during the 30s up to the 50s. Bear in mind that most of the actors also have no or little previous musical experience (Liv Ullmann was even dubbed in the movie), and one can understand why the numbers just fall flat. Just to see the Bergman queen of angst do a Julie Andrews impression, as a happy Von Trapp dancing (or at least swing her arms) around the mountainside, is reason enough alone to check out this movie (in fact, Ullmann refuses to talk about this movie when doing interviews nowadays).That said, this movie ain't half bad. It starts of as a promising drama about people on the run from a war ridden China, who crash land in a picturesque, mountainside utopia where time stands still. In fact, before you hear a single song almost a third of the movie has already been played out. After that the producers tried to stuff in as much music as possible, to justify the label 'musical'. A real cult classic that helped sink the musical genre. Still, there's something about it that holds your interest to the very end. For a serious interpretation of the story, watch the older Capra version instead, but if like a bit of creamy fluff on your pudding, this may very well be your dish. 'Everything depends on where your are in this circle without a beginning... lalalala'</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent cast. Sumptuous scenery. First rate crew. Loved the book.Sounds like a recipe for a great film. Then some fool decided to turn it into a musical, and hired Bert Bacharach to write the score. One can only think that whoever this person was, he (or she) must have been a saboteur from a rival studio. If Michelangelo had subcontracted to a crew of chimpanzees to paint the Sistine Chapel, the results could not have been much more disasterous. Bacharach's insipid melodies and inane lyrics turn Shangri-la into a hell on earth. It's no wonder they have to kidnap people to get them there. What is surprising is that Michael York and Olivia Hussey are the only ones who want to leave.For the benefit (?) of anyone who has not seen this abomination, try to envision the talentless Bobby Van dancing in front of a class of Shangri-la schoolchildren, singing "Question me an Answer." Lerner and Lowe, in their worst moments, never descended to such depths. And one can only speculate about the songs that were cut from the film after they caused hysterical laughter among a test audience in Los Angeles, prior to the film's release. But not on a full stomach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ouch!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After hearing about it's wonderful awfulness for years, I finally was able to see Ross Hunter's Lost Horizon on HDTV. Ouch! Everything I had heard proved to be true; the songs were dreadful, the acting fourth rate, the casting ridiculous and on and on and on. The only saving grace for me (especially in HD) was the beautiful photography of Bruce Surtees. Otherwise, disaster.One thing that disturbs me about this film is that it is often lumped together with the O'Toole/Clark Goodbye,Mr.Chips and Star as the three films that drove the nail into the coffin of the once popular musical film genre. Star, though overlong and somewhat clunky, has a certain charm and some wonderful music, and Goodbye,Mr. Chips, to me,is quite wonderful, working on every level. (I think Chips got crucified mainly because it just happened to be an old fashioned musical in a time that was thriving on being "Mod.") Lost Horizon, on the other hand, had no redeeming features(except for Surtees) and was just terrible.Producer Ross Hunter gets the blame for this dreadful mess, but lest we forget, he was also the guiding force for the wonderfully entertaining Throughly Modern Millie. He should have quit when he was ahead!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Horizon -skip the unfair, reviews, see this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What makes a musical, is the music. The music in this is excellent. Burt Bacharach and Hal David seldom miss and here they hit on every song. Reflections, The World is a Circle and I Might Frighten Her Away being great songs and routines. I recall, this movie bombed, was panned, by fan and critic alike, when it came out. At the time, the 70's, musicals were not a hot topic. Unless you were making a gritty, realistic, musical, like Cabaret, you were going against the grain. Dancing and prancing people seemed strange in this time of Easy Rider, Midnight Cowboy and grittier films of the era. The movie was mistimed to be sure, because there isn't anything more ridiculous in this, than any of the great musicals of years past, be it prancing, knife wielding, gang members, to store clerks, to lions, to scare crows.I am sure the great actors, known so much more so for drama, than a musical, threw off the public. Seeing Ullmann, Finch, Kellerman, York, and Kennedy especially, so often playing the heavy, in lighter roles was different. But guess what? They are all great actors and pull it off completely.If you have read any of my reviews you know I review lesser known or disparaged movies that I feel deserve a lot better fate. Why review, for the one millionth time, Casablanca, Spartacus, Network, or Gone With the Wind? Guess what? They are great and considered so for a very real reason.Lost Horizon, on it's own is one of the best musicals made and a great telling of the classic story. The B &amp; W, Ronald Coleman version , as good as it is , is flawed due to the lost footage and the scars the film has due to it's repair. This musical version, is the best version of Lost Horizon, I recommend giving it a try . I guarantee you will be whistling the songs soon after.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Michael Medved wrote extensively about this movie in his Golden Turkey Awards book back in the 1970s. I didn't get a chance to see it until some years later. It's wisely kept out of the public eye.Lost Horizon was supposed to be a high-gloss "prestige" picture for Columbia with great music, exotic sets and memorable acting performances. I think they were hoping for something on the level of The Sound of Music. What they got was a movie that's just wrong on every level. The concept didn't work. The acting was wooden, and the plot was dreary. What I remember most were the strange, almost sickly sweet songs that made it onto the soundtrack. I don't know what Burt Bacharach was thinking. I watched some clips of this movie recently, and the whole thing looks manufactured- like nobody really believes what they're doing.It's almost as if whoever was in charge had never done this type of picture before. The studio initially prepared a large marketing campaign around it, expecting a hit. It would be fascinating to know just when the movie studio bigwigs at Columbia figured out they had a disaster on their hands. A possible explanation- it was probably doomed from the start. By 1973 styles had changed drastically, and the necessary people who previously could have given you something as good as South Pacific or West Side Story were all off doing other things. Jesus Christ Superstar was what a musical looked like in the early 1970s, not this.It immediately tanked at the box office, and we can only speculate about how many Hollywood careers ended as a result of this turkey. I don't know if it's ever been released on DVD. You've got to see this movie it to believe it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The 1973 Lost Horrizon has an honored place on Michael Medved's Fifty Worst films of all time. I don't think it's quite that bad, but given the budget for this film on purely financial terms it has to be in the record setting elite.I think the biggest problem was making this a musical remake. The songs by Burt Bacharach and Hal David are some of the worst ever put in a film score. Worse than that they seem totally just grafted into the film and add nothing to the flow of the plot.Probably in a straight dramatic version Peter Finch would have been a marvelous substitution for the incomparable Ronald Colman for whom the Frank Capra 1937 version gave a him a role he was born to play. But I think that when doing a musical it might be a good idea to have both leads actually be singers. Both he and Liv Ullman were dubbed. James Shigeta who did do the film version of Flower Drum Song, Sally Kellerman and Bobby Van who actually was a musical performer did their own work.Lost Horrizon also is a story set during the time when the British actually had an empire. The lead character James Conway is a Cecil Rhodes type character, but with the best of his character and as the British liked to see themselves in their imperial days. Big mistake to have updated the story to the present. They did not update the character of Conway.Lost Horrizon is a passably entertaining film, but hardly worth the time and the money spent on it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I wont belabour the plot: if you don't know it by now, then you've been living under a rock for these past 80 years.But what truly amazed me on watching this is how much it lifts ? in terms of adaptation, photography, entire chunks of dialogue ? right out of the Colman version. It's as though someone sent Larry Kramer (the sorta screenwriter) the script used in the 30s and told him to rewrite... but not too much. So a couple of characters are revisited ? the paleontologist becomes a stand up comedian, the investor becomes an engineer ? but everything else is taken, almost shot for shot and line for line, from the earlier film. In some cases ? such as the cave at the end where (SPOILER) the young girl's actual age is revealed ? it's like they even went so far as to use the same set.And the sad thing is that the earlier one was no masterful adaption itself: talky, almost proselytizing at times, it rearranges things in HIlton's novel to suit some unseen agenda ? and Ross Hunter blithely continues down whatever path that might have been, making many of the same mistakes, but on a larger, grander scale: for example, the lamasery in Colman's version looks like it's right out of the NY World's Fair of 1939, while the one in Hunter's film, while a simple re-build of the castle from CAMELOT, looks larger, grander, and much more incongruous for a Himalayan valley. The musical numbers... sigh. They range from the moderately acceptable to the egregiously awful. The "Fertility Dance" in the middle of "Living Together" is one of those "You really have to see it to believe it" moments, while Bobby Van's "Question Me an Answer", despite its American-centric approach, almost makes the cut as reasonably fun and enjoyable. To be honest, he looks like the only one there having a good time. The rest appear, at times, downright embarrassed to be taking part. But if anything else, the musical numbers, inserted with all the finesse of a sledgehammer, underscore how much this thing owes to not the book but the previous film. Cut them out and watch it with the Colman side by side, and you will be amazed at how audacious the theft is. I'm giving it a three only for Van and Boyer, whose scenes as the High Lama are at least watchable.Someday, someone will do a film of this book that actually rises to the lovely brilliance of the original source material. This one, sadly, is not it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Plot Makes for Unrealistic Expectations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lost Horizon is not nearly as bad as the box office numbers would suggest. Its chief failing is the audience comes to see Shangri-La and sees, well, Burbank. Actually, it looks more like the Huntington Gardens. It would have been better to improve upon the book's shortcomings rather than try to recreate it. Perhaps a "Wizard of Oz"-like plot, where all of the people meet along parallel paths to Shangri-La, only to discover their real sanctuary was where they came from. I remember getting a preview copy of the album quite some time before the film was released. I loved the music, but would have to agree the vocal performances are a disaster. But, I was looking forward to seeing it in the theater. At nearly 2.5 hours in its roadshow release, I was checking my watch about 45 minutes into the piece. Even when I watch it on DVD today, there are large sections I fast forward through. As others have noted, why didn't Ross Hunter hire people who could sing in the key roles? Probably studio pressure for "bankable" stars who were "hot" at the time. No doubt someone also observed Bacharach &amp; David are pop song writers, and you don't need to be a very good vocalist to sing pop--right? Well, the more recent musical disaster, the aptly named "Mamma Mia!" ABBA tribute also suffered from dreadful vocal performances. So much for the "anyone can sing pop" theory. Make no mistake, Meryl Streep and Pierce Brosnan are fine actors, but they should never the be the leads in a musical! Why not cast Glenn Close?But back to "Lost Horizon," I think the other problem is by the time this was released in 1972, the music and presentation were considered dated or "old school." Similar complaints were leveled at Hunters 1970 film "Airport"--calling it "old fashioned filmmaking."So, you've got three things working against the film: a dull plot, dated music, and principal vocalists who can't sing. Now some have commented that the Hollywood musical was dead by 1972. There were some other big features that only had mediocre results at this time, but just 6 years later, "Grease," with a budget of just $6 million, earned almost $400 million at the box office. No doubt it was helped by a couple of hit singles, but there was certainly some audience interest still out there. Disney seems to have found a formula that appeals to a new generation with its "High School Musical" series and its forthcoming "Teen Beach Musical." Several of the studio's animated musical features have been remade into successful Broadway musicals. Time will tell if there is a revival of interest in big budget, big screen musicals with principals who can actually sing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad it's bad</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Everything you've heard about this movie is true, except the part about its awfulness being "enjoyable." To paraphrase Ghost World, "it's so bad it's gone past good and back to being bad." The movie begins promisingly enough, after a mundane folk ballad and long credits sequence, with a scene of intense conflict as a diplomatic crew attempts to flee a war torn country. Enjoy this scene while it lasts because it is the only genuine conflict you will see in this film. The pilot crash lands in a place called Shangri La, which despite being totally cut off from the outside world is well-maintained and full of food and all the worst of hippie New Age fashion. All of the characters, except one ? Michael York ? seem to enjoy living in Shangri La, and no source of menace or tension appears in the plot to dissuade them. Although this is a musical, the first non-integrated number appears about 50 minutes in. And it's a lousy rehash of Joni Mitchell's "The Circle Game." The musical staging appears to be that a character states a thought, and then a song begins that reaffirms the thought in the most glaringly obvious manner ("Am I in Shangri La, or is Shangri La in me?" "Different people have different points of view." You don't say). The staging of the numbers is very similar to The King and I; although it only serves to remind you that you should be watching that instead. As the characters decide either to stay in Shangri La, or to leave for no apparent reason (since the script has no villains or conflict), we are lead to a non conclusion that resolves nothing and says nothing. I suppose this was sold as some kind of Age of Aquarius, anti Vietnam, "Imagine no countries," type of deal, but it just comes off as a lame hippie high school production. I could literally have written better songs and staged better dances, and I have no rhythm or musical talent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they'd listened to me ...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Back in late 1971, when I was a green kid in the U.S. Army, I read in a newspaper that Ross Hunter was remaking "Lost Horizon." I loved the James Hilton novel, but I wasn't crazy about the 1937 movie because it seemed so "Hollywood." I hoped the new version would be more true to the book, and I had an idea about how to do that.I wrote a letter to Hunter suggesting that he make the movie in northern India, where there were real Himalayas and a lot of Tibetan refugees. Those refugees didn't get much attention back then, so the idea seemed like a way to kill two birds with one stone: helping unfortunate people and making a movie more authentic.To my shock, Hunter wrote back, thanking me for my military service and my suggestion, but telling me that he was "very much against runaway productions." (Though I lost the letter years ago, I still remember that phrase.) I was disappointed, but I respected the famous producer for sticking by his guns. It didn't occur to me then that production costs were probably his main concern.A couple of years later, I went to see the movie. By that time I was married, and I took my wife along, promising her an interesting movie experience. But all through the film she kept whispering, "It's so boring," and finally I had to agree she was right. It was really much worse than the earlier film. There were some beautiful shots of snow-capped peaks, but then the characters wound up in some sort of amusement park and started singing bad songs. And no real Tibetans in sight!Gosh, I wanted to like this picture, but nothing was believable, and the songs were simply awful. Any number of forgettable movies have had better tunes, and certainly better lyrics.If Hunter had taken my suggestion and added a little ethnic authenticity, this would have been a marginally better movie. But even my best advice could never have made it a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This latest version of "Lost Horizon", a musical remake of the 30's fantasy about a group of people who find Shangri-La after their plane crashes, was a big, fat, juicy, and notorious flop when originally released in 1973, and has often been cited in numerous articles and books about Hollywood's celluloid mistakes. (It's said that, at the time, Hollywood's nickname for it was "Lost Investments".) Having finally seen it a few years back, thanks to the cable channel AMC (this was before they started adding commercials), I have to admit - and I am a huge, HUGE fan of bad movies! - it's not as bad as the lore would have it. Oh, sure, it's overlong and overproduced (typical of Ross Hunter productions) and some of the Burt Bacharach-Hal David songs are indeed cringe-worthy ("Living Together, Growing Together" and "The World Is A Circle", at least as they are presented here; perhaps with a different arrangement and better direction and choreography they could work) and the acting often a bit overbaked, but there ARE some positive qualities to be found: some of the cast display admirable - albeit definitely untrained - singing voices, in particular Liv Ullmann and Olivia Hussey (Sally Kellerman's is actually interesting); the cinematography and costumes are spectacular (again, typical of Ross Hunter productions); some of the music is actually pretty decent, though it sure ain't Bacharach &amp; David's finest hour by any stretch of the imagination: while their undeniable stamp is in every note, the lyrics have that unmistakable feeling of treacly, heavy-handed 70's "self-help" running throughout. The whole film definitely belongs in that "what might have been" category: another cast, another score, another director and producer, and it may have found the success that all involved here expected. Overall, what works, works adequately, and what doesn't, doesn't at all. Still, it's worth taking a look at, though I doubt any but serious musical devotees will bother. It is, unfortunately, apparently unavailable on VHS or DVD (though it seems a Laserdisc was released in 1992); when and if it's released on DVD, it'll be interesting to see if any of the cut musical numbers and scenes will be reinstated, and presented in widescreen (AMC's showings are strictly pan-and-scan: whole musical scenes have nothing in the middle while actors remain securely to the sides - NOT a plus!). Check it out, if you get the chance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ditto on the "hilariously bad"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I attended a first release screening of this movie with friends from school. We were intrigued by the premise and how it would be translated into story and sets. Imagine Shangri La, a subtropical micro climate valley hidden by the vast Himalayas and built over centuries by those whose long lives allow the accumulation of great wisdom. Would senior residents speak with posh British accents while younger members look like extras from South Pacific? The "Bangkok Hilton" sets (buildings with verdegris patina and garden pools festooned with rampant tropical blossoms) made me squirm. Then I think Liv Ulmann closed a door that sounded like hollow core--yoicks. My friends and I began sniggering. The audience shushed us indignantly. It might have been a Bobby Van number that set us howling. By then others in the audience could not contain themselves either, but at the time neither could they bring themselves to laugh--it was hyped as a major Hollywood undertaking. Most people just groaned a lot. Too bad Mel Brooks was not given this assignment from the start.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dismal Musical Remake of a Cinematic Classic...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>LOST HORIZON is the dreadful 1973 remake of the 1937 film classic about five passengers on a snowy journey on a plane that crashes in an exotic fantasy land where the weather is always beautiful and no one ever grows old. This idea probably looked a lot better on paper than the finished product, but it is a definite curio. It features static direction by Charles Jarrot and some really awful Burt Bacherach/Hal David songs like "The World is a Circle", "Share the Joy", "The Things I Will Not Miss", and "Reflections". The obviously embarrassed all-star cast includes Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Michael York, Olivia Hussey, George Kennedy. Sally Kellerman, James Shigeta, Bobby Van,John Gielgud, and even Charles Boyer. I have never seen a musical put together with more non-singers and non-dancers in the cast in my life...what were these people thinking?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why take a perfectly good original drama, based on a perfectly good novel, and remake it as a quasi-musical? And cast it with actors exclusively lacking in singing or dancing talent? Somewhat akin to "Showgirls" or the two most recent "Star Wars" films, "Lost Horizon" is full of unintentional laughs. Who can forget Sir John Gielgud smiling uneasily in his Dali Lhama outfit, overseeing an interpretive dance to the Republican party ("Family")?Or Sally Kellerman warbling lovingly to George Kennedy, doing her best Cher impression as she hops from one rock to another ("Every Little Thing You Do")? And my favourite, Bobby Van embodying the strength of America's education system ("Question Me An Answer")? I can't wait for the DVD release, as hopefully it will contain comments by Liv Ullmann, who will finally explain what she was thinking when she agreed to do this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I can imagine what happened for this film to come into being: a bunch of studio guys are sitting around, drinking gin-and-tonic, maybe a joint, and one of them comes up with the idea that it would be great if they could find a film that would bridge the generation gap, which at that time was about as far apart as Archie Bunker and Mick Jagger. Something that both college-age rebels and their parents would find equally interesting-- for different reasons, perhaps, but still, a ticket is a ticket. What interested hippies? Asia, philosophy, pacifism, and wild sets and costumes. What interested their parents? Musicals, eye candy, a feel-good script, and nostalgia. Very well, then, "Lost Horizon", the old classic, as a musical, in color. Can't miss, right? It was a bomb. Lost Horizon, by James Hilton, is perhaps less than a classic, but not a bad novel. In broad terms, he sketches out a utopian society in Shangri-la, "The Valley of the Blue Moon", near Tibet, inhabited by peacefully contented villagers who serve an abbey of &lt;i&gt;very&lt;/i&gt; long-lived monks. Intruding into paradise is a Gilligan's Island-like planeful of outsiders (a veteran of WWI, a missionary, etc.) each with their own spin on the situation -- what plot there is concerns the reaction of each of them to being presented with a choice to live in paradise, or try to return to the tumult of the Twentieth Century. Taken on its own terms, it's gentle, pop-lit fluff, presenting Hilton's own conservative British views in "Oriental" dress, as exotic and as familiar as a fortune cookie. As captive honored guests of the monks, the castaways are forbidden to leave the valley, but never pressed into work or prayer (not that the monks do too much of that themselves), treated royally, and given simple, yet luxurious accomodations --who'd want to escape? In this Middle American Heaven-on-Earth, the monks are both cultured and wise, the climate is warm, the food is plentiful and tasty, the villagers are picturesque nonentities and nothing ever changes. The nuns are chaste, but encouraged to look pretty, and even flirt a bit ( the reason given is one of the most hilariously inaccurate explanations of Tantric Sex I've ever read). Even their religion is nonthreatening: revealed as a best-of-both worlds blend of Christianity and Buddhism, there's little to offend any but the staunchest fundamentalist or the oddballs out there who actually knew something about Tibet (which in the early Thirties was a very small number).As a Capra film focussing on the adventure/character interplay angles it was enchanting; and perhaps Steven Spielburg could have made it fly, if he'd been around. As an early-Seventies Hollywood product, the adventure was over too quickly, and the updated roster of characters too bland, to make much of an impression. Deprived of the sketchy, suggestive qualities of classic B&amp;W, the monastery resembles a de luxe beauty spa in white and pale blue, and while at least some of the monks' robes tried for historical accuracy, most of the rest of the inmates looked as if on their way to a morning massage and fango bath, with a couple of holes of golf in the afternoon. Maybe Stephan Sondheim could have restored some grit to the story, playing up the very real conflict inside each character's reaction; just five years afterwards, Brian Eno would have captured the tranquil atmosphere to a T; instead, Bert Bacherach and Hal David were given the job of writing the songs, which marry Muzak-like melodies with some of the clunkiest New Agey lyrics ever penned. Quite naturally for the time, every song calls for a dance number, which range from the merely forgettable to the completely boring, and so is the script, which has not one line worth quoting.Tie-ins with this movie were legion -- there were everything from cookbooks to posters planned to promote this film, and such was the hype that I actually went out and bought the sountrack album. Just about the only thing good I can say about it is that it made enough of an impression on me to write this review completely from memory nearly thirty years after -- the next month I read Aldous Huxley, bought a copy of the Bardo Thadol, and hence learned about real Tibetan culture. Moan.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was flipping through the channels the other night with the volume down when I skipped past what appeared to be a documentary on Nepal or Tibet. I flipped back to see a beautifully photographed religious procession of oriental monks of some sort who were singing as they marched. Curious, I turned up the volume, and heard - to my disbelief - what appeared to be the outtakes from a recording session by the 'Mamas and the Papas' on a bad day, being sung by these monks. The combined sight &amp; sound was unbelievable. Unable to avert my eyes, I watched, fascinated, in the same way one watches a train wreck.This was "Lost Horizon", a mid 70's stinker that deserves a place among the top flops of all time, and could replace 'Plan Nine from Outer Space' as the worst movie ever made. It stars Peter Finch [sic!], John Gielgud (must have been desperate for work at the time), George Kennedy, Sally Kellerman, Liv Ullman , Michael York and Charles Boyer (his last - understandably - film). It is a MUSICAL based on the James Hilton novel about a band of westerners who discover the idyllic land of Shangri-La in the Himalayan mountains. Boyer plays the aged monk who founded the place; his makeup looks like wood putty applied with a trowel.The costumes are by the people who just missed getting the contract for "Sgt. Pepper". The dialogue is like 'Brigadoon' meets 'The King and I' by way of 'Hair'. The big question is how they held back their laughter at the final screening.The real stunner, however, is the musical score. I did not catch Burt Bachrach's name in the credits, and I can understand why he would want to be anonymous, but he is the perpetrator. These tunes are as easily remembered as the index to a software manual, and the lyrics sound like an unimaginable cross between Timothy Leary and Eleanor Roosevelt (with Leary straight and Eleanor strung out).This film is SO bad it is worth seeing. Only then can you believe it. As Newsweek said at the time: "It cannot be enjoyed even as camp."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If Ed Wood got high on LSD and made a musical...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...and somehow persuaded Bacharach and David to write songs for it, this is what would result. Of course, Ed Wood would never have the kind of budget to make this, nor his pick of prestige stars. Funny thing, when I saw this as a little kid I was actually impressed. I think the gorgeous footage shot in the Cascade range of the Pacific Northwest was a part of why, and the obvious care put into the building of sets. The production values are through the roof here. However, looking back on it, this deserves all of the brickbats it's gotten. John Gielgud in yellow-face. Sally Kellerman and Liv Ullman and Peter Finch trying to sing. Everyone trying to dance except for Bobby Van, who obviously is a hoofer. And Bobby Van lays on the corniness, almost making his dancing as cringe-inducing as the non-dancers trying to dance.This is most definitely a creature of its time as well. The cheesy New Age philosophy of the lyrics is cringe-worthy. And of course, the misunderstanding of Tibetan Buddhism that goes all the way back to James Hilton's original novel. Yes, it's directed like a '40s or '50s golden age musical, and movie musicals from the period like Godspell, Jesus Christ Superstar and The Wiz had more of a gritty texture from shooting on location instead of on a back lot with something other than big, lumbering 65mm cameras. And the costumes...dear goddess the costumes look like they came from Sears' Exotic Groovy India and China collection of 1971. Yes, it IS that bad. Producer Ross Hunter wound up never doing theatrical pictures again after Lost Horizon. He spent the rest of his career doing TV movies, exiled from the big screen. Making a flop-o-roony like this, which cost $12 Million in early '70s dollars to make and only took in $3 Million in early '70s dollars at the box office, was definitely enough to make no studio want to take a chance on future projects of his. It ranks with the legendary failures of Hollywood studio pictures...Heaven's Gate would come later, and would actually wind up being vindicated after the fact. I see a few people actually sticking up for this steaming pile. Each to their own taste, I suppose. But really...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Blu Ray: Dream-like film is wonderful in a very 70's way</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have just enjoyed seeing this long forgotten gem on Blu-Ray, in a marvellous crisp and colourful wide-screen presentation, with DTS stereo surround sound and I loved every minute of it. It's like a crazy LSD trip (I imagine!), which makes you very relaxed and feel just great.I first saw this film in 1973, as an 11 year old on board a Mediterranean cruise ship. The on board cinema was just like the real thing and I watched Lost Horizon at least two or three times during the voyage. I also enjoyed seeing the new Bond Live And Let Die and the wonderful thriller Endless Night. I still love all these films and they bring back happy memories of a simpler (and wackier) time.Of course, Lost Horizon is most definitely a guilty pleasure. If you did not grow up in the 70's, it must come across as a very dated and very odd load of old rubbish. The film starts off as action adventure and suddenly changes into a very strange kind of musical, with a score which was very 1973, just like some of the god-awful clothes worn by Michael York and Bobby (please don't dance) Van.The main Shangri-La set looks like a 1970's Burbank Hilton Resort and the obvious studio set interiors are very much over lit. They look like old sets re-used from the Bill Shatner Star Trek shows.The Direction it very old fashioned and lazy. The actors move across the screen, but the camera appears to stay static. However, the worst thing in Lost Horizon is most definitely the hideous choreography from Hermes Pan. The worst I have ever seen.However, the cast is very likable and some of the songs are really quite pleasant and catchy in a very early 70's way. Looking back now, in 2013, the idea of Shangri-La has never been more attractive and I would love to buy my one-way ticket any time they come available on line. Until then, I can take my trip from this wonderful new Blu-Ray disc.Yes, the film is flawed, particularly in the wasted opportunity to direct the musical numbers in any stylish way, but I absolutely love it. I can't wait to see it again!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I never miss a Liv Ullman musical!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've reviewed several films I saw originally as a child or teenager then saw again years later as an adult. "Lost Horizon" is one of the few I do recall actually seeing at the theater when it first came out. My parents had the movie soundtrack album as well, and years later, I found it on CD, as well as the full movie on laser disc and finally now on DVD. It seemed for years, I could not find it listed on TV, but then all of a sudden, TNT had it, and years later (right before they added commercials to their lineup) AMC had it. The AMC commentator alerted audiences that it was one of the biggest bombs of its time, prompting the Bette Midler line I use in my summary. Of course, Liv Ullman, then even bigger than Liz Taylor or Audrey Hepburn (getting the film "Forty Carats" over them), was a strange choice for a musical, but then again, so were Lee Marvin, Clint Eastwood, and on Broadway, Lauren Bacall and Katharine Hepburn.But who really cares when the performer is obviously dubbed? Liv wasn't cast without reason. She is still one of the shining lights of European cinema who happened to make it big in America for a while. I don't know what her singing voice is really like. The album for her Broadway flop, "I Remember Mama", features Sally Ann Howes instead. But she is perfectly cast as the Shangri La school teacher who entrances visitor Peter Finch and teaches her students that the world is a circle without a beginning, and nobody knows where it really ends. As that big production number ends, I envisioned the Ingalls girls from "Little House on the Prairie" tumbling down the very same hill in that shows opening credits, as it appears to be the same location (and around the same time, to.) I would love to edit the two pieces of footage together and surprise audiences viewing this movie with the inserted clip.But anyway, for some reason, like some other reviewers said, I have never gotten this movie out of my mind. Columbia and Ross Hunter apparently spent millions of dollars on this big attraction, and critics had fun ripping it apart. Unlike Caesar, I'm not going to bury or praise it, but go through a few of the moments that stand out in my mind as unforgettable. I can feel that some people probably wanted to slap Bobby Van's vaudevillian character, and I can see why, because he does indeed seem out of place. The goofy looking grins just add to the silly outfit he (and the other visitors) are forced to wear, and in his big # ("Question Me an Answer"), is one of those "Springtime For Hitler" #'s that could leave an audience gaping with their mouths open rather than bring them to applause had this been a live show. Ironically, Broadway had done "Lost Horizon" as the musical "Shangri La", and it too, was a flop. The flop musical book "Not Since Carrie" said the plot was too similar to "Brigadoon", and that is true.Fortunately, in the prints available today, a few of the Peter Finch songs are cut out. They were probably good for bathroom breaks back in 1973, but added as extra footage on the laser disc, they are yawners. I also love to laugh at the silly overly heterosexual "Living Together, Growing Together", and would love to see the missing dance footage that is apparently anything but heterosexual. The trailers on the DVD release feature bits of them, obviously edited out later on. As for Sally Kellerman, she gets two campy numbers-one with Olivia Hussey ("On the List of the Things I Will Not Miss") and another singing to George Kennedy ("Reflections"). Hussey's "Share the Joy" is a total bore. I think of the cast, Ms. Kellerman is the stand-out. Producer Hunter rushed together all the hot actors of the day into this, including "Cabaret's" Michael York and Finch, fresh from "Sunday, Bloody Sunday". Veterans John Gielgud and Charles Boyer don't sing, but at least with Boyer, we get a glimpse of what he would look like had he played Scrooge.One critic described the scenery as "Pickford re-designed as a hotel". If you look at the 1937 version by Frank Capra, there are some similarities with the set, so that comment does not ring true in my opinion. I am uncomfortable, however, by the lack of a song pre-Shangri La and towards the end. This makes the sudden onslaught of songs once the setting changes rather awkward. I know having a song on a high-jacked airplane or a snow-capped mountain with crash survivors would seem silly or out of place, but a song to calm down the passengers could have been inserted to make this transition been less jarring. I also think that the title song, sung over the credits, is one of the most underrated theme songs ever written. The lyrics really express the theme that the movie expresses, one of an ideal world which deep in most people's hearts they probably want but are too afraid to fight for. Its failure is blamed mostly on the timing, as the political climate of the early-mid 1970's made most musical films extremely unsuccessful. Critics were cruel, and attacks on every aspect of it seemed to be more personal than general opinion. There just seemed to be a desire to take the creators down a peg or two since they had all been involved in major successes. Time has been kind to the musical of "Lost Horizon", and as the world heads into different styles of wars and disasters, perhaps the longing for what this movie expresses isn't such bad wishful thinking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I was young I was a great fan of James Hilton but had never seen the earlier version of Lost Horizon. You can imagine how excited I was to find that a new full color version was going to be released. The film had most of the qualities to be a hit to me. The settings were mostly magnificent, the cast contained some excellent actors and much of the feeling of the novel was there. But, ultimately I felt cheated. Between the inclusion of truly unnecessary comic relief, and the attempt to make it a musical just did not work. Much of the music was enchanting, and the song "Share the Joy" deserved to be remembered forever. But the big show numbers with dancing Lamas and the antics of some of the secondary characters simply ruined what could have been a real treat for me. The main theme was too modern and urban to support the fantasy of Hilton's Paradise on Earth, a Sanctuary from War. It was an almost made it movie that sadly did not. I was finally able to see the 1937 version years later, and even with many of the scenes that were lost over time and in black and white it remains the superior version. I would love to see some attempt to re-film the story today, returning more faithfully to the book.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This version of Lost Horizon pretty much finished the job Rex Harrison's Doctor Doolittle began: that of burying the Movie Musical for years. But the question is, why? What exactly went wrong with this production? Well, the answer is... a lot.Let's put it in context. We're dealing with the cynical Nixon years and Watergate and Vietnam are both dragging. Here's a film with a message about how terrible life is, and how the planet is falling apart, save for one small place that no one can reach... Shangri-La. That's probably not a message anyone wanted to hear at that moment.OK. If the theme doesn't put you off, the stars probably would. Granted, casting non-singers in a musical and having them dubbed is a long standing Hollywood tradition. But who thought to have George Kennedy and Peter Finch as "singers?" Burt Bacharach's score is actually pretty good (though it's clearly not his best work, Bacharach on a bad day is still worthy of a listen), and the film has some cute moments (mostly provided by the children of this paradise along with Bobby Van who mugs his way through the bulk of his material), but they are outnumbered by the stilted ones... Sir John Gielgud makes the worst on-screen Asian since Mickey Rooney in "Breakfast At Tiffany's!" On the better side, there is Sally Kellerman, who really deserves a lot of credit for her efforts to make this palatable, even in trying to sing a romantic duet with Kennedy! I'm not familiar with the background of how this film got made, but it seems like people cut deals, signed on for the project, and then, as they began making the film, they discovered it wasn't working. But, rather than go back, rewrite and correct the problems and re-shoot, they tried to force fit the jigsaw pieces together, producing the final result which was destined to fail.I find this film a fascinating curio, but I can see where others would dismiss it as trash. However, it's not a complete waste, and that's where I think some people are too harsh. You can view it as camp, as comedy or as commentary on life in the post Ecology 1970s, a theme that has become timely again with the resurgence of caring for the environment and Global atmospheric issues.It's funny that this film came out in the midst of the Irwin Allen "Disaster" film era with their all-star casts... The Posideon Adventure, The Towering Inferno... In its way, Lost Horizon fits right in!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When I first saw this film at it's release, it was compared to 'The Sound of Music' in a local publicity blurb. Well 'The Sound of Music' it ain't but enjoyable none the less, for all the wrong reasons. I showed this film years later to my brother who (for the first 45 minutes) kept turning around to me and saying, "are you sure this is a musical?" "Yep (I answered), just wait till they get to Shangrila". When they do finally arrive, all musical hell breaks loose. Personal favorite part is the look on Peter Finch and Gielgud's faces when they watch the children rolling down the hill towards the end of 'The World is a Circle'. Is Gielgud thinking, "Oh hell, there goes my career!" Also love those various angles Sally Kellerman is shot from while she sings her song with Goerge Kennedy. And Bobby Van singing 'Answer me a Question", well you have to experience that one for yourself.However is it all bad? The library song isn't too bad and the opening song in the clouds is liked by some as well. Some of the background orchestrations are pretty good and as a 15 year old when I first saw this film, the story held a certain intrigue for me as well. However, 32 years on it really looks like a 'final days of the musical' last ditch effort that fails to work on almost every level.If you have a few friends who love bad films, get them together and treat them to parts of this one, they'll love you for it.</fullReview>

The idea of making this into a musical was not a bad idea , it is just the way it was carried out. At best , it seemed to be a knock-off of The King and I and Oliver ! Unfortunately ,it didn't even make it that far. The songs were insipid and the actors were wooden and phony. The scenery was the only redeeming factor, but most of that looked a little too contrived to be truly believable. I was disillusioned by the realization that my "favorite " actress really owed her entire previous performance in Romeo and Juliet to the brilliant directing of Franco Zeferelli. In my opinion , it would be a kindness to all the actors involved in this fiasco , to ceremoniusly burn every last copy of this ridiculous film failure !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Although the general consensus has been that this is an awful movie, I do not agree with this view. Granted, the film does have its lapses, but makes up for this in sheer scope and atmosphere. I believe that the fine cast, especially Peter Finch, did more than their best in making the film believable for audiences. Its failure at the box-office may have been somewhat surprising, but understandable given the context of the changing winds of 1970s cinema, and its increasingly fickle audiences. With regards to the songs which were in the film, I did not find these off-putting, but in fact, found that they added to its heavenly feeling. I think that the problem has been a comparison with the earlier version, but this can stand on its own feet as a thoroughly professional remake.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've been listening to the soundtrack, today. Some of it's melodies are simply enchanting. Burt bachrach's music is worlds ahead of mainstream fluff. He and Hal David were very "arty" and were sort of a Sondheim for Pop music. I've been listening to Dionne on Scepter.... Stunningly beautiful, especially the pieces that were not big hits. But, I can understand why people just don't get them, because they are "arty" and complex. So, too are the songs of this musical. And yes they do sound a little smarmy and dated, but...then again, so do so many things from 1973.I agree that the music and the movie (in hindsight) were probably a bad marriage. I can't really imagine what people were thinking when they decided to put together so many elements. I guess i should read somebody's autobiography.I think re-making it as a musical was not an implausible idea. How many other unlikely things have been made into successful musicals. I really think it's unfair to claim that this production was responsible for killing the hollywood musical. The hollywood musical was already in hibernation and required a long period of dormancy. So, now we have that silly Moulin Rouge which is a fun confection, but has no original music of it's own and will soon look and sound horribly dated.Just had to share. Listen to some Bacharach and love the magic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>If they had just killed Bobby Van and eliminated the songs, I would have been a nice film...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>..but unfortunately no one thought about having Van killed in order to save this doomed production. The only positive thing about him in the film is his nice singing voice...too bad the songs are mostly insipid and sappy. Why did I hate Van so much? Well, throughout the film he seemed like he was doing a third-rate Soupy Sales imitation--with lots of mugging, bad jokes and way too much energy spent trying to make everyone laugh. The worst of these moments was when he was "teaching" the class--these kids laughed at EVERYTHING he did. Heck, Van could have read the phone book or showed them autopsy photos and they probably would have laughed! Now Van was not the only bad casting decision in the film--he was just the most obvious. Of course, having John Gielgud (a lovely actor) play an Asian was ridiculous as well as having Michael York play Peter Finch's brother!! The bottom line is that because of these insane casting choices, the film was doomed from the start....and the worst of them was the god-awful Bobby Van. Now in real life, he might have been a lovely person and it's sad that in real life he died so young, but with the material they gave him here I just wanted to rip out his tongue to get him to be quiet.Now I also mentioned the songs--egad, those terrible songs!! The original LOST HORIZON by Frank Capra was a subtle delight throughout--and not a single song and dance number in the film. So why did they decide to add a bazillion songs that did nothing to help the film? They only served to make it seem like a gooey mess--like the original DOCTOR DOOLITTLE combined with LOST HORIZON. The end result is a sickly sweet children's movie--not one that can be enjoyed by anyone over 8.Now if you can remove these problems, you have the basis of a decent film. After all, the plot is lovely and is still hidden beneath all the goo. Peter Finch is particularly good (though certainly not the equal of Ronald Colman in the original). But, considering that the original was a near-perfect classic, why bother with this sticky confection. Who wants to wade through the treacle?! By the way, this film was included in "The 50 Worst Films" book by Harry Medved. While I, too, disliked the film, it wasn't bad enough to merit inclusion in the book. I think it was included mostly because it was such a huge box office failure and because it was released just a few years before the book appeared. An excellent book--just not one of the best selections to the "hallowed hall" of dreck.</fullReview>

Words fail me in describing the true horror of this THING that virtually killed the musical as an art form. Several friends tried getting really stoned before watching it, but even that didn't work. One of them held a symbolic burning of the video tape and invited her friends.The embarrassing poverty of the music and dance was exceeded only by the inappropriateness of both of them, both in substance and timing. I can only sympathize with those that were desperate to leave this saccharine HellIn some yin-and-yang karmic balance, I can only conclude that the brilliance of Peter Finch in NETWORK simply had to be somehow offset by featuring him in the most unspeakably bad and embarrassing role of anyone's career.

The songs, without exception, are HORRIBLE--so bad they're good! "The World Is A Circle" has got to be one of the worst songs I've ever heard! And poor Liv Ullman is forced to sing it while leading a bunch of obnoxious little kids up a mountain (or something like that). How did they get Peter Finch, John Gielgud (playing an Asian!) and Ullman to do this? Were they really that hard up for cash? They're all great actors, NOT singers (or dancers). George Kennedy, Michael York and Sally Kellerman all try to give decent performances, but are stuck with bad dialogue. Olivia Hussey looks like she wishes she were somewhere else and Bobby Van is REAL annoying (I just wanted to strap him down and shove a bottle of Valium down his throat). The songs keep popping up out of nowhere and they just get worse and worse. Well worth seeing--a guaranteed laugh a minute!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was rarely off the TV in Britain in the 70s and 80s (critically trashed films seem to get much more airtime, maybe because they're cheap? I don't know). I admit I haven't seen it as an adult, but to a naive mind, what could be more thrilling than discovering a secret kingdom, whether it's inside your TV, at the back of a wardrobe, or over the mountains. It was certainly one of the more memorable films from my childhood, very colourful, and some of the songs were great (of course I had no idea at the time they were from the legendary Bacharach and David, who are far too harsh on them). The World is a Circle I've never forgotten and I've added it to my Spotify.And any holes in the script (Larry Kramer!) could be compensated for by gazing on the eternal loveliness of Olivia Hussey.Maybe it'll be shown on TV again someday so I can see if it's as painful for grown-ups as they say.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My folks and I went to see this at a drive-in, when it came out. They basically told me I was in for a treat. Because they had seen the original and knew it was a great story. And (I think) they assumed Hollywood was still functioning, and could be relied on to deliver good entertainment.But this was the 70's. There were a lot more big-budget flops than ever before. There were many terrible, incompetent musicals, like Darling Lili, Star, Song Of Norway, Doctor Doolittle (inexplicably nominated for Best Picture), and others. Seemed like Hollywood had lost its way more than a little bit. For instance, what kind of musical has no song numbers for the first 45 minutes? And if you were doing a musical version of this other- worldly, mystical, magical story, would you hire Burt Bacharach and Hal David to do the songs?A musical Lost Horizon might have worked with songs by, say, Lerner and Loewe (I picked them because, after all, Brigadoon was sort of a Lost Horizon in kilts). They might have provided a score of beauty and taste, a musical-movie score and not one that sounds like it's supposed to be on AM drive-time radio. They also might have integrated the songs into the story. To say that little effort was made to re-think and re-shape this property into a proper musical is putting it mildly.The original film gives you a feeling of scope and grandeur, whatever you may think of the unexpectedly Art Deco sets. A well-thought-out and well-designed musical could have given you these things, too. Instead, we get, among other miscalculations, a lamasery refashioned from the castle set of Camelot (1967), that looks for all the world like a huge Chinese restaurant plunked down in Topanga Canyon.Overall when the film should capture your imagination, it feels like a sort of land-locked Love Boat episode, and when it asks you accept its premises, it just doesn't seem real enough. It all looks like a set, and people in costumes. The score takes you out of the story and place, instead of bringing you into it. The actors seem like actors, not characters. Nor does it help that the cast had already appeared in some very adult, realistic, sophisticated films - Sunday, Bloody Sunday; Persona; M*A*S*H, etc. The world had changed, movies had changed, and even acting had changed. While I believe it was still entirely possible to make a decent remake of Lost Horizon - even a musical one - at that time, it needed a whole different approach.</fullReview>

They escape in an airplane with a small group, headed for Hong Kong. Unfortunately, the plane is hijacked and crashes in a remote area of the Himalayas. Fortunately, the travelers make it to Shangri-La, a paradise where people live in perfect health and age very slowly. It's not exactly Hollywood, but there is an all-star cast. On board are song and dance man Bobby Van (as Harry Lovett), uptight photographer Sally Kellerman (as Sally Hughes) and gold prospector George Kennedy (as Sam Cornelius)...Mr. Finch is attracted to singing schoolteacher Liv Ullmann (as Catherine) while Mr. York prefers pregnant dancer Olivia Hussey (as Maria)...Wise old Dalai lamas John Gielgud and Charles Boyer are befriended by Finch. He moves closer to the secret of Shangri-La. York mostly wears regular clothing. This is symbolic because he wants to leave with Ms. Hussey, though she may revert to her true age. Many people felt older after sitting through "Lost Horizon". To make it a musical for producer Ross Hunter, the popular songwriting duo Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David contribute some of their least memorable songs. Charles Jarrott directs with catatonic seriousness. Picturesque photography by Robert Surtees is a relative strength. All told, this re-make of "Lost Horizon" is a lost cause.*** Lost Horizon (3/14/73) Charles Jarrott ~ Peter Finch, Michael York, Olivia Hussey, Liv Ullmann</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A bad idea badly executed</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More of a bad idea than a particularly bad movie. Remaking the Frank Capra classic (based on the James Hilton novel) and adding some highly forgettable songs by none other than Burt Bacharach &amp; Hal David just does not gel. The story is now legendary: a plane carrying a small group of people crashes in the mountains and the survivors are brought to a mythical land called Shangri-La. It's a place where nobody ages and there's no violence. Sounds like a dull place? Try sitting through this movie. Nothing comes together here and the addition of several ill-placed musical numbers are laughable rather than entertaining. The filmmakers further their many blunders by populating the film with the likes of Peter Finch, Liv Ullmann, Michael York, John Gielgud and George Kennedy, none of whom has any business appearing in anything even remotely approaching a movie musical. One time MGM song &amp; dance man Bobby Van (the poor man's Donald O'Connor?) soft shoes through two numbers but adds very little. He's also saddled with performing the worst of the lousy songs...the highly idiotic "Question Me an Answer." Classy Charles Jarrott was brought in to direct and does so in a fairly straightforward manner. The direction is neither particularly imaginative nor particularly offensive. Additional wasted talent includes Jean Louis (costumes), Robert Surtees (cinematography) and Hermes Pan, who surely had his eyes closed concocting the silly choreography. The great Larry Kramer wrote the screenplay.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Perspective</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Do you ever get the feeling that some of the creators in Hollywood, when looking for a story to turn into a musical, are looking for a challenge? Or maybe their minds instantly turn to the most successful dramatic films? "Grand Hotel", for example. "Battle of the Bulge, the Musical" cannot be far behind."Lost Horizon" was ripe for the picking, I guess. And maybe someone saw a parallel with "The King and I" with its scenes of Asian courtly life? The result is an uneven musical. It has been noted that Bacharach and David were on the verge of breaking up their partnership when they wrote the score for "Lost Horizon". But we have to wonder if their pop sensibility was appropriate for this project.The cast is another issue, but the script does not make great demands on the actors, so perhaps the casting is not so important. Most surprising is Olivia Hussey ("Romeo and Juliet"), who can sing and dance. From today's perspective, it is rather fun to see who appears in this film. Sally Kellerman ("M.A.S.H."), George Kennedy ("Cool Hand Luke"), Peter Finch ("Two For the Road"), Michael York ("Logan's Run"), and Liv Ullman (?).The story is Jules Verne-ish--travelers discover a strange, isolated world that has mystical properties. Then a love story ensues: As the new arrivals to this world are walking up a flight of steps outside a huge lamasery, our protagonist looks up and sees a woman standing on a balcony about, oh, a quarter mile away. He is enthralled by her beauty, or at least what he can discern of it. She looks down at the large group ascending the stairs and sees one of the men stumble. He is embarrassed, but she chuckles and they instantly fall in love. We have all been there.Mix in some lengthy walks in treacherous Himalayan blizzards and some light-hearted tunes sung (and danced to) by Bobby Van, and you have "Lost Horizon", the film that wants to be everything to everybody but ends up being lost in its own murky vision.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lovely musical with a goal to show us what life could be like, compared to what it is. It also brought the caftans into the limelight, to the point of Elizabeth and Richard Burton to be married in one.As an entertainer of the 70s, I adopted the number done by Sally Kellerman and Olivia Hussey (in the library) into my act, which always brought on a standing ovation for me, and whatever local talent I brought into the number.The casting was almost perfection ... the talent above par! Sally Kellerman's part hit home ... big time! And she played it to almost perfection, save the slightly forced bedroom scene. Sally sometimes tends to go over the top enough to be very noticeable. Someone else may have done a better job in her over the top parts, yet not do as good elsewhere. Casting directors are usually very good at finding the right person for a part ... but not 100% of the time, as is obvious when it comes to William Shatner in anything but Star Trek ... and Jeffrey Hunter was better for that series than Shatner ... but it was not meant to be.It is so nice to see Charles Boyer is a movie such as this one ... uplifting! Liv Ullman and Olivia Hussey were perfection ... as were the other main characters ... especially Bobby Van. Musical score by Burt Bacharach, with lyrics by Hal David ... a great team! Now we come to the story of Shangri-La ... which was originally created by James Hilton, and came about during his visit to Nepal. A place I visited in the spring of 1978. Kathmandu is the capital city of Nepal, and is at the foot of the Himilayan Mountains. Kathmandu is surrounded by some of the highest mountains in the world that are crowned by the glory of Mount Everest, the highest peak on earth. Due to these high mountain ranges, there are no televisions, and no radios ... because there are no radio waves, etc.! If that has changed due to satellites, I am not aware of it. Like I said, I was there in 1978, and I have not been back. It should be noted here that foreigners were only allowed to visit Nepal, and Tibet, after 1924, I believe. When I was in Kathmandu, I got to see the royal elephant ... the only elephant in Kathmandu ... and I also was able to meet the King's mother, whom lived behind the home I was renting. What Kathmandu is like now is unknown to me ... but in 1978 it was filled with unbelievable experiences ... some, not so great ... others, totally inspiring. But nothing like this movie. If it had been ... I'd still be there.Now we get to Michael York. Casting him in Cabaret was genius ... casting him in Lost Horizon was not. The part was completely out of character for him.Basically, this is a family picture, a feel good movie, that should be enjoyed by all ... numerous times.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, come on it's not THAT bad! This film should have worked .. and in a way it does. Okay the stars are not singers but the story is perhaps one of the best escapist stories ever written. Don't we all long for a place far away from it all....Listening to the soundtrack some thirty years on Burt Bacharach's songs are really quite good. "If I could go back" captures the yearning of a man torn between a love he's never known but found in paradise and trusting himself to believe he's found a better place and life than the world he's left behind."The world is a circle" is a catchy tune that has stayed with me since I first heard it. "The things I will not miss" is a stylish duet and holds well. One terrible cut is when Conway first arrives at Shangri-La and is blinded by sunlight having left the icy slopes of the Himalayas a moment earlier - it always jarrs as this should have been a scene filled with wonderment. Nul Point!Yes, it's schmaltzy and the choreography is naff (shame on you Hermes Pan!) but the weight of the stars - John Gielgud, Peter Finch and Michael York - manage a half decent job and it was deemed good enough to be chosen for The Royal Film Performance of 1973.With all the dross that's currently being churned out on DVD by the studios (I for one am sick of Terminator 99's) why not give space to this musical - after all, the point of musicals is that they're meant to transport you to another world which is just where Shangri-La is. Be interesting to see if a straw poll were taken how many voters would want this released....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you want to spend a couple of hours with your mouth hanging open, with your jaw dropped in incredulity, this is the film for you. I mean, honestly, I couldn't believe how mind-numbingly awful this film is. The 1937 Capra non-musical original was brilliant. This musical version basically takes the Capra film, populates it with actors who can't sing, adds color and bad 1970's hairstyles, and introduces the most mediocre songs imaginable. Not a single tune is memorable, and the lyrics are simply worse than pedestrian. Speaking of pedestrian, watching people walk down city sidewalks might be more entertaining than the dance numbers in this film.Even if they'd found truly talented songwriters and choreographers, I was left with the general impression that this particular story just doesn't lend itself to the musical genre, but I could be wrong about that. Lerner &amp; Loewe did something amazing with George Bernard Shaw in "My Fair Lady," and Rodgers &amp; Hammerstein did something equally amazing with James Mitchener ("South Pacific" on Broadway - not the film which was mediocre and not the TV version with Glenn Close which was inexcusable.) So maybe the right songwriting team could have adapted this story. I just don't know for sure. What I do know is, Lost Horizon (the musical) needs to be seen to be believed, and that's the only reason I can think of to see it.Load up on caffeine first -- it'll help you not to nod off as this film bores you to death -- and it'll give you a good excuse to spend time in the bathroom which means you won't have to watch as much of the movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>WOW!!! Talk about your "Post-Traumatic Song Syndrome!"I had been reading about this fabled flop for years, when one day it finally came on a basic cable channel we had just started receiving; either WGN or a station out of New York, and I made a vow that I would NOT miss it at any cost. I think I was sitting by the TV at least an hour before it started, to make sure that nobody changed the channel, and that there was no way I would miss it by accident. WHAT can I say that anyone else here hasn't said already?Just for comparison's sake, some years later I did see the B&amp;W/Frank Capra version, and then a color remake made (IIRC) during the '80's. And it was then that I could see where the attraction came from; the 'thing' that had made Ross Hunter and his crew sure that this would make a BOFFO blockbuster musical. And the possibility still exists today, with just one caveat: HIRE SINGERS WHO CAN ACT, NOT ACTORS WHO CAN'T SING! And I'm not sure if I'm recalling this correctly, but I seem to remember that actually NOBODY was dubbed, though they all definitely should've been, even Bobby Van!!The most striking thing about the whole mess was the lavish song and movie score provided by Burt Bacharach and Hal David. I thought it might be some of the best work they had done together, especially being a big fan. Their biggest obstacle was that it would've been great music...for ANOTHER movie! It wasn't just the casting or the "choreography" (and I use that term loosely), but just that seeing and hearing these songs coming out of actors like Liv Ullman and James Shigeta just seemed really OFF. Like there were songs that went with the movie, but THESE weren't the ones. Remember the classic backlot recording studio scene in the Jerry Lewis movie THE ERRAND BOY, and the hysterical result? That one scene accurately describes what it's like to watch ALL of LOST HORIZON.I would someday like to be able to see this one more time, to check out if it really was as outlandish as I remember it to be. But I did hunt down and find the soundtrack ON VINYL, and I have kept it since. Maybe I'll even fix my turntable one day, and play it one more time, just to recall the beautiful songs set to those incredibly inappropriate visuals..."Li-ving to-ge-ther Gro-wing to-ge-ther Just be-ing together That's how it starts Two lo-ving heaaaaarts..."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Musical Numbers Ruin Otherwise Decent Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lost Horizon (1973)** (out of 4)A plane full of people head off for Hong Kong but the plane is hijacked. They end up crash landing on a snowy mountain but soon a group of people come to their rescue. After a long walk through the mountains the people land in Shangri-La.This remake of Frank Capra's 1937 classic was released into theaters with an already negative buzz surrounding it. The film had an extremely large budget for the time and it was clear from early screenings that no one was going to like it. The movie was a disaster at the box office and it gained not only the reputation of one of the worst movies ever made but many people blame it for killing off the musical genre. How's that for a reputation? I should add that in a funny twist, it was one of the only major Hollywood movies that never even found a VHS release. While this isn't nearly the disaster it was made out to be, you still have to wonder what on Earth they were thinking.This movie was released during the disaster film era so you've gotta think that they could have cut out all the musical numbers and been left with something that could have at least been thrilling or entertaining. The movie could have been a straight remake with current special effects and an all-star cast and ended up much better. I actually thought the first portion of the movie was pretty good. We got a decent action sequence to get things going and for the most part I thought the cast were entertaining. The conversations and scenes on board the plane were at least entertaining. Once they get to Shangri-La things still weren't that bad. The locations and scenery were actually very good and the film at least looked terrific. The cinematography was also extremely good, which was another plus.With that said, nothing that happens in Shangri-La can be taken serious because of the awful and downright embarrassing songs from Burt Bacharach and Hal David. Roger Ebert even started off his review asking how much Ross Hunter had to pay them and added whatever it was it was too much. I'd certainly have to agree because these songs appear to be aimed at 5-year-old kids and even they would probably be bored by the length and subject of the movie. Clocking in just under 140-minutes, it's doubtful any kid would make it through this thing and for the adults watching you can't help but look at the screen wondering what they were thinking.LOST HORIZON will always been known for everything wrong with it but perhaps time has been a little friendly to it. It's certainly no where near the original but fans of "bad" movies or poorly received movies will want to check it out.</fullReview>

I have seen far worse movies, and also much worse musicals, Xanadu, Can't Stop the Music, Mame, Grease 2, A Chorus Line and The Wiz( At Long Last Love like this is more so bad it's good quality rather than just bad) are all worse than this in my opinion.I will get the good things out of the way. The scenery and cinematography are beautiful, and while it doesn't completely fit with the movie the score and songs aiming for the glossy sophistication of the 1937 film, are lovely and are memorable. The cast also try their best, with Sally Kellerman and Michael York faring best. Liv Ullman is decent, as are Peter Finch and Olivia Hussey.George Kennedy however gives a performance that feels rather phoned in, and the normally excellent John Gielgud struggles with a character that in my opinion is little more than a caricature. The dialogue in general is trite, and the story this time around with the fanciful ideas done so well in the Frank Capra movie(which is not a masterpiece but very charming) only risible here very thin for the running time, with little charm and heart. The singing/dubbing in all honesty is not great, Mame and At Long Last Love are much worse with this, but the singing does sound strained and pitchy.All in all, an example of so bad it's good. 5/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You have to be a fan to appreciate this!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The retelling of a classic story is set to the music of Burt Bacharach and lyrics of Hal David. The actors seem like real people in this fairytale of the outside world meeting with mystical Shangra-la. It is a joy to watch Bobby Van, whose acting puts me in mind of Red Buttons, and, as always, George Kennedy (Cool-Hand Luke) who always manages to carry gravitas in his roles. The surprise here is Charles Boyer as the elder High Lama. Who would have known? All-star cast including Michael York and Olivia Hussey makes this work a keeper for those of us who cherish people.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Critics comment of 1973 musical version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was about 14 years old as I saw the musical version of Lost Horizon. I loved the film so much as well as the songs that I went several times to the cinema to see it again and again. My mother bought the LP and I learnt the songs off by heart, just as I did with "The sound of Music" (which people hardly know in Austria). I think the problem with some of these self-appointed critics who's comments get published is that they don't have a romantic soul and didn't see the film through the eyes of a young teenager. Maybe he is an Ingrid Bergman fan but I was happy with Liv Ullman. Could Ingrid Bergman sing and dance? What was so great about her? Perhaps the critic did n't appreciate it because he needed new glasses or contact lenses since he sees a close resemblance between Liv Ullman and Bill Clinton. It was the idea and story behind the film, the philosophy, which was the most important and interesting factor and a musical in colour just made it more entertaining and enjoyable without damaging the intellectually appealing aspects. It's a shame that many other films with so called great actors and actresses with unimportant themes / stories are utterly boring in comparison.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very unique kind of musical. Film evokes the giddy happiness Hilton wrote about in his novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1973 musical version of LOST HORIZON is a most wonderful endearing and campy musical. The 1973 musical remake of the James Hilton novel about mythical SHANGRI-LA! is a real special gem. Music by BURT BACHARACH and lyrics by HAL David. A strange mixture of straight drama, adventure and musical sequences. It has the distinction of being the only anti war musical fantasy ever filmed. This film was a critical and financial disappointment in the United States, but made a lot of money overseas. Only in America did it fail. Highly different and unique in it's approach as a film musical, it deserves far better credit than it's given. As a story, LOST HORIZON is an incredible adventure and both the 1937 Frank Capra film and this 1973 musical are faithful adaptations of the James Hilton novel. What I like about the 1973 version is the freedom in which the musical numbers are presented. The film has a prestigious cast and a gifted director and cinematographer. This is a BURT BACHARACH Shangri-La and it's a wonderful place. Songs like THE WORLD IS A CIRCLE, SHARE THE JOY and LIVING TOGETHER, GROWING TOGETHER evoke a happiness that Hilton wrote about in his novel. Why shouldn't Shangri-La be a slightly goofy place? The two love songs, I MIGHT FRIGHTEN HER AWAY and the deleted I COME TO YOU are the sensitive spots in the picture. There's a peacefulness and soft spoken quality in both these songs that is very much keeping with the philosophy of the story. Moreover, THE THINGS I WILL NOT MISS is a good duet with a strong melody. It's a nice exchange of different types of perspective and who can fault with Olivia Hussey and Sally Kellerman stomping, singing and dancing on tables? They're a wonderful team and the number is well staged. I always found it interesting in this story how the High Lama kidnaps someone from the outside world to take his place in Shangri-La. The character of the High Lama is a gentle soul but somewhat radical in his view of mankind as a whole. He has no hope for the world outside of Shangri-La. If this film were to be remade today, it would be interesting to see more emphasis put on the leading character, RICHARD ONWAY'S conflict with what he left behind in the outside world as opposed to what he's found in Shangri-La.Of course, for the film to be believable, the character of RICHARD CONWAY must be presented as suffering amnesia at the end, like he was in the book. Neither film versions of LOST HORIZON were faithful to the novel in that regard. Did Conway find Shangri-La or was it imagined? Did they all die in the plane crash? Every man has his own idea of what his Shangri-La would be. The conflict with Conway wanting to believe in Shangri-La and returning to his old life in the outside world is powerful. I like the melancholy on the faces of Kellerman, Kennedy and Van as they watch their friends leave the mystical valley. Interesting how Conway doesn't want to leave paradise, but is being pressured out by his brother. Both versions of LOST HORIZON work in different ways, but both are successful in probing James Hiltons ideas of a hidden valley where money has no value and moderation is the rule. So in a sense it's anti capitalism in it's theme where as money and materialism is not the motivation. Human kindness, decency, compassion, courtesy, etiquette and living harmoniously with each other is the rule. LOST HORIZON has a much stronger story than most musicals. It attempts to answer the basic fundamental questions of life and one can hardly fault it for not succeeding. One has to remember that LOST HORIZON in 1973 was post CABARET. It was no longer fashionable for characters to break out in song in a musical, much less to be dubbed by other singers. LOST HORIZON was an easy target for jaded critics. The expectations for it were high, almost unreasonable. There were two targets to be hit, the producer, ROSS HUNTER and BURT BACHARACH and the critics were out to get both of them. Ross Hunter had enjoyed decades of financial success as a producer and LOST HORIZON was his follow up film to his 1970 blockbuster AIRPORT That film was Universals biggest moneymaker up to that time and the success of that picture triggered a decade of disaster films. For years AIRPORT was the most watched film ever to be shown on television. It was nominated for 11 Academy Awards including Best Picture. At the time, Burt Bacharach and Hal David were the most successful songwriters in the country. The unabashed sentimentality of LOST HORIZON hardly had a chance in the wake of the breakdown of censorship in films like EASY RIDER, MIDNIGHT COWBOY and THE GODFATHER. Sex and violence was a new frontier in the late 60's and early 70's Audiences were flocking to films with content that they were not use to seeing on the screen. Lavish musicals were no longer well received no matter how well they were made. Today LOST HORIZON can be enjoyed and appreciated on several levels. It's the ultimate escapist film with a strong story, wonderful music, an expensive budget and some quirky humor. It's unconventional in the sense that the music is not introduced until 45 minutes into the film. It changes course mid way when the mystical valley is introduced and why not? LOST HORIZON '73 is a heavenly film that deserves rediscovering. A lost and legendary treasure deserving far better than it's reputation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Super musical about a wonderful dream land!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have to offset all the terrible comments. I love this movie. I own the movie and the soundtrack. I watch it whenever I need a pick me up. Granted it's not like the Sound of Music but it's as much fun if picking at movies is not your thing. I adored the late (and great) Bobby Vann, and James Shigeta has always and will always be a favorite. I saw this when it first came out in the theaters. I'm a big musical fan and this one is 100 times better than Twiggy in "The Boyfriend". It's a modern musical and shouldn't be judged by all that went before. It's just the best for dreamers like me, who wish they could find this place - no illness, no wars, no drugs, all the bad things in life are gone. This is nothing more than a feel good movie. That is what all movies should be about. Shaun Phillips title song is superb and explains the entire feel of the movie. If the acting isn't the greatest-who cares. I love the idea of the movie. Peter Finch, a very stiff actor, Liv Ullmann, gorgeous as ever, Sally Kellerman, surprisingly good voice, Michael York, typical, and Olivia Hussey, stunning, all convinced me they were normal run of the mill people. Not one of them acted like actors in a movie. They acted like real people, the same way I would act if I found this place. Torn between going home and staying there, in awe of everything. Yes, there are flaws in this movie, but get over it, it's not Citizen Kane, it's a feel good musical!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Simply underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently purchased Lost Horizon on ebay, having vivid memories of the Things I Will Not Miss number from childhood (I am an ancient 29). I also recently finished the novel upon which it is based. I was so pleasantly surprised to find a genuine hidden treasure. A wonderful cast brings such warmth and depth to a beautifully simple and elegantly told story, subtly updated from the original film (and by now quite a separate entity to the far more intellectual and thought provoking book by James Hilton). Sally Kellerman in particular has a radiant presence as the suicidal neurotic Sally Hughes, who gradually warms to the charms of Shangri-La. Only Liv Ullmann flounders in her wooden portrayal of the schoolteacher (a role far more suited to a Julie Andrews type. The fact that Finch, Ullmann and Hussey are all dubbed isn't important as it is almost impossible to tell. The songs DO vary in quality, the music being far superior to the lyrics but it is still a vibrant and engrossing film that really deserves a proper DVD release and a lot more recognition.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Clear example where devotion of fans to original clouds vote on new version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie is excellent. Acting, cinematography, direction and music are spellbinding. It seems to me that the reason so many give the movie a low score is because of the devotion they have to the original, 1937 version starring Ronald Coleman. That movie - for good reason! - engendered an unbelievable level of commitment. From talking with people who saw the original when it first came out, I believe the impact was something akin to the first "Starwars" movie in modern times. I have seen it. It was and is wonderful. But that does not mean that this version is not also worthy. From the first scene the 1973 version grabs you. The noise and tumult are fantastic, especially in they way they prepare you for the peace of Shangri La. And Burt Bacharach's music is beautiful. So - by all means enjoy the 1937 version. But do not let it detract from your enjoyment of this 1973 version any more than you would let the 1935 King Kong destroy Peter Jackson's of this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So bad, you might die laughing!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I must qualify this review before I go any further. I saw this film as a child, and was mesmerized by it. I wanted to climb the Himalayan mountains and find this magical place called Shangri-La. I bought the soundtrack to the film and played it until the record wore out. So tonight, I turned on the TV set, and to my incredible delight, Lost Horizon was on! I hadn't seen this film in over 20 years, and all I can say now is that I was one stupid kid!What in the world was producer Ross Hunter thinking? Did he actually believe he could turn this classic tale into a musical?This film must be watched, if for no other reason than to see Sally Kellerman and Olivia Hussey "dance" and "sing" in the local branch of the Shangri-La library to an insipid Burt Bacharach tune. And why is Liv Ullman in this film, playing the ingenue who steals the heart of Peter Finch? Watching her cavort with the youngsters (she's Shangri-La's only elementary school teacher, you know) in true Sound of Music style, you can actually see the humiliation on her face. It's as if she's saying, "This is for the paycheck and my ticket back to Europe to make a Bergman film."But the highlight of this movie has to be the late Bobby Van doing a big, show-stopping tap number with the adorable children of Shangri-La. The dance inspires him so much, he decides to help out Liv and become a school teacher himself. Good thing, 'cause her work schedule was getting horrendous.This film is the 1970's version of Showgirls. A laugh riot from beginning to end.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really not that bad, except for the numbers with Kellerman</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I caught this on AMC with high expectations for chuckling at what is supposed to be one of Hollywood's worst musicals. I was rather disappointed. Basically a good cast, with Finch and York displaying proper conviction and emotion for their roles. Pretty good production, with nice sets and a fairly convincing plane crash. And the songs, well I can't hum any of them 3 hours after viewing, but they were fine in a very 70s Bacharachy way. Where the movie falls apart is the staging of several of the numbers, especially the two (why two) with Sally Kellerman. These made me laugh, or was it groan. She can't sing or dance. As far as the rest of the movie, only occasionally can she act. But all in all, this is far from an awful movie. 7 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I was on tv-now.com looking at a film schedule for Olivia Hussey when I saw Lost Horizon listed on AMC. I couldn't find a copy anywhere, and so I was looking forward to seeing it. I got about 40 minutes through it and it was a great film. Unfortunately, the music started... This movie knows how to hit the mark, and it knows how to royally screw up and does both. Whenever there's no singing, this adaption of the novel is a good movie with a strong cast, beautiful locations, and nice colorful and exotic costumes. If only they had stuck with that, I would give the film a 7 or 8, but when the music comes in, it's terrible. There's not enough for it to be a musical, but it's still there. It's corny music, some of the worst by Burt, and totally changes the mood of the film. The only one that really fit was the dance by Hussey while the guests were having dinner. With the music, I'd say a 5. If you have the option of fast forwarding through the musical numbers, then definitely give this a shot. Without the music segues it flows nicely and tells the story effectively.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments on the 1973 Movie Lost Horizons</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen the 1973 movie Lost Horizons and read many of the reviews for this movie. I agree the move had many opportunities for improvement but unlike all those who are looking for the perfect movie with the perfect songs and the best acting, I was looking for something a bit different and this movie gave it to me. I watched this movie not as a critic but as a person looking for a little hope, a little cheer, a bit of a release from my everyday life, and this is what I got. You can be critical of the acting the singing, and dialog but that't not what I look for when I go to a movie. I look for a little release from my daily life, a little time where I can sit back and imagine a better life, where people love another and help another. It's a shame we can't we enjoy a movie for what it tells us and quit picking it apart like an English teacher reading a fifth grade essay. This may be very simplistic, but really, wouldn't it be nice.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Musical Paradise - NOT!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As much as I love Liv Ullman and respect Peter Finch, there are just no redeeming characteristics to this remake of the James Hilton classic. I am a big fan of Hilton's novels including Lost Horizon and Random Harvest. This musical version does no justice to the age old story of a paradise here on the earth. Plus, I find it odd to see Burt Bacharach doing movie musicals when his trademark was always sappy love songs.Don't get me wrong - I love movie musicals - especially good ones like West Side Story, the Music Man, Brigadoon, etc - but Lost Horizon as a musical just totally blows.If you want to see a version of Lost Horizon that captures the wonder of Shan-gri-la and is true to Hilton's work then I suggest you catch the 1930's B&amp;W version with Ronald Coleman - you'll be glad you did.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For 30 years I have heard the stories: the sheer cinematic awfulness, the abysmal box office, etc......Now I have seen it for myself: a wretched cross between the TV movie "Lost Flight" (with Bobby Van in both!) and "The King and I".... Where to begin? I am Burt Bacharach's biggest fan, but I can't imagine what types of drugs he was on when he wrote these "songs". This film single-handedly destroyed the big-budget musical, and now I understand why. I'm surprised that Bacharach and David didn't kill each other after this.The "Club Tiki-Tacky" sets, which appear stolen from a Polynesian tourist trap restaurant, are an embarrassment. The "dramatic" scenes sometimes appear to have been done in one shot. The criminal waste of a brilliant cast....this film is not even in the so-bad-it's-fun category. It was and remains an appalling spectacle (like the Hindenburg, but without the body count).</fullReview>

The songs are the highlight. No wonder Hal David and Burt Bacharach ended their songwriting partnership after these creations.Truthfully, the songs are so bad they are funny especially The World Is A Circle which seems to be going for a Sound Of Music effect. Michael York's character is the only one I identify with in that he wants to escape from Shangri-La.Who wants to live in a place where Peter Finch sings and Boobby Van tap dances forever.Pretty Horrific!

		<shortDescription>Hollywood insiders quickly dubbed this one "Lost Investment"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half-hour or so follows the 1937 classic pretty much scene-for-scene, and everything's okay. Then we get to Shangri-La and the movie quickly falls apart. First, there's the time-honored Hollywood tradition of casting non-singers in singing roles, so we get dubbed versions of Peter Finch, Liv Ullman, and Olivia Hussey... none of whom were noted for their work in musicals. Sally Kellerman gets to retain her own singing voice, and while it's okay, she's given junky, utterly forgettable songs to perform. One particularly embarrassing number has her singing to an uncomfortable-looking George Kennedy in a stream. (At least Ross Hunter didn't have Kennedy attempt to flex his vocal pipes!). Kellerman also teams up with Hussey in a silly "show-stopper" that compares the merits of city living and Shangri-La living. The only two good singers in the cast, Bobby Van and James Shigeta, are only given one number apiece. Van is mostly around to supply dubious "comic relief," yet his mediocre comedy talents pale next to the unintended hilarity one finds throughout this picture. As for the rest of the cast, there's the great French actor Charles Boyer in heavy latex makeup as the 200 year old High Lama (and, no, he doesn't get to sing). John Guilgud as "Chang" and Michael York were the other lucky souls who didn't have to embarrass themselves lip-synching to Bacharach-David tunes. The songs themselves, by the normally reliable Burt Bacharach and Hal David, make up what's easily the most terrible soundtrack in the history of musicals. One reviewer likened Bacharach's bouncy melodies to baby-food jingles, and David's supposedly "profound" lyrics to a drug-addict's pseudo-intellectual dissertations on the Meaning of Life. Reportedly Bacharach and David were fast approaching a break-up as a song-writing team, and it certainly shows in this wretched score. Add to this the forced "joyousness" of the normally gifted Liv Ullman leading dozens of talentless kiddies as they supposedly "sing and dance their way into our hearts," and it all gets rather sickening.The costumes are a "groovy" mix of pastel-colored leisure suits and Mao jackets. Shangri-La itself, for a place that's supposedly ancient, looks surprisingly modern -- and very pedestrian. I think Hunter filmed his opus at the Phoenix Holiday Inn. All that's missing is the putting green! The public's reaction to this sticky-sweet morass of a movie was predictable -- they stayed away in droves, leading Hollywood wags to dub this atrocity "Lost Investment".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this movie for the first time on late night television 16 years ago. I, like a lot of people who have seen this movie, thought it was okay up until we got to Shrangri-La when all the non-singing and non-dancing started. Actually I did like the songs especially The World is a Circle" and even bought the soundtrack for it on vinyl (I'll have to try to get a cd copy of it). I like the melodies to most of the songs in the film but I wished more effort was given to the choreography and singing(Marni Nixon, where were you?)as well as the acting , writing, direction, etc. I must admit I always had the hots for Olivia Hussey. I never thought this film was as bad as all the critics claimed it to be. As a matter of fact I liked it enough to have bought the Laserdisc back in '92. So every now and then I put it on to watch it. If and when it comes out on DVD, I will buy that too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This has to be one of the worst movies ever made. It is laughable how bad the acting, songs, sets, etc. are. A child would be instantly bored watching this, although the "The world is a circle" song is so bad, one just has to laugh.How high caliber actors like John Gielgud, Liv Ullman and Peter Finch ever ended up in this bomb is amazing.Watch for the yuks!</fullReview>
