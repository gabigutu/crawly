		<shortDescription>`Lost Horizon' is indeed a remnant from the golden age of cinema.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There is an aura that seems to surround classic films made before the days of computer generated visual effects and intense marketing campaigns. It was a time when motion pictures depended on grand stories, superb performances, and great direction to catapult their success. This was exactly the case of `Lost Horizon,' a film from director Frank Copra (`It's A Wonderful Life'). With elaborate set designs, excellent performances by Ronald Colman, Jane Wyatt, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell, and Edward Everett Horton, `Lost Horizon' is a story of survival and ultimately finding a way home, that cannot be forgotten. `Lost Horizon' is a tale of five castaways who inadvertently find themselves in Shangri-La after their plane crashes in the mountains of Tibet. They are lead into the place of eternal youth, natural beauty, and free from strife by members of the region. They are treated as guests, and although they want to leave and find their way back to the world as they know it, porters are hard to find. It all leads to a notion that none of them want to admit; that they were meant to be in Shangri-La. Out of the thousands of movies that have been produced in the past 100 years, only a few afford of the privilege of remembrance. What's more, only a few seem to survive due to the nature of celluloid prints breaking down over time. A similar problem plagued `Lost Horizon,' in that after decades of worthy theatrical re-issues, the prints depreciated, with many withering away. As such, a preservation program was set in place to save copies of the film. Thanks to the works of countless individuals, this classic has been restored, to a certain degree, with some of the footage missing, replaced by still shots of the actors and recorded dialogue. From a critical standpoint, `Lost Horizon' has stood the test of time to be one of the greatest adventure classics ever produced by Hollywood. What is astonishing about this film is the attention to detail. As the film begins, a battle is taking place somewhere in China where we meet our protagonist, Bob Conway (Coleman). As the film continues, the scene changes to a scene on an airplane where our characters are trying to leave the war torn region. At one point, the crew is at a high altitude where the temperature is very cold. As such, we can see their breath in the shot as they speak. Normally, this kind of feature is ignored as the scene is short, but it adds a touch of realism that can't be denied. Incredible detail went into the creation of Shangri-La. With its large sets, beautiful costume design, the film takes on an epic proportion only rivaled by the grand designs of such Biblical epics as `Ben-Hur,' and `The Ten Commandments.' Truly, director Capra wanted to create an image that audiences would be astounded by?and he truly succeeded.One can't help but admire the characters-they are all a bit na?ve, but all intriguing in their own ways. Conway (Coleman) is a British diplomat and explorer whose fame is well deserved. His brother, George (Howard) presents a great deal of fear for the unknown Shangri-La. The characters of Henry Barnard (Mitchell) and Alexander P. Lovett (Horton) add a real sense of humor to the film. There are some minor inconsistencies in the story and various tasks that the characters try to pull off, but it's hardly worth complaining about because the film is such a treasure among other films. After 66 years, `Lost Horizon' remains far better than most of the adventure films that play in cinemas nowadays. One can only wish that they could have been present to see this in a theater during its original run. How amazing it would have been to see this epic tale of survival and the human struggle against itself back in 1937. `Lost Horizon' is indeed a remnant from the golden age of cinema. ***1/2</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"I believe it because I want to believe it". This one line speaks volumes about what the movie (and the original novel) was trying to say. The concept of Shangri-La, a place where people work and live in peaceful harmony, is as relevant today as it was in the post-World War I era that James Hilton wrote 'Lost Horizon', where the world was still in turmoil following a devastating war and another was on its way.In these days of war, humanitarian devastation and disease, how many people are there who dream of getting away from it all and living out their lives in a remote paradise just like Shangri-La? The High Lama's words to Conway resonate strongly even today."Look at the world today. Is there anything more pitiful? What madness there is! What blindness! What unintelligent leadership! A scurrying mass of bewildered humanity, crashing headlong against each other, propelled by an orgy of greed and brutality." On a more cinematographic note, the movie is visually stunning in an age before CGI and astronomical budgets. The beauty of Shangri-La, the stunning mountain landscapes and the overall settings of the movie make us believe that such a wonderful place can exist. All the actors are commendable in their portrayals (though some characters are different to those in the original novel) and their interaction with each other add a real sparkle to the movie.'Lost Horizon' is a beautiful adaptation of James Hilton's masterpiece and captures the very feeling of the novel and I would highly recommend it to anyone who has ever dreamed of escaping from the hectic world in which we live.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Happy Valley</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Frank Capra adapation of James Hilton's popular novel, Lost Horizon, was somewhat controversial in its day, not polticality but because of its length (several reels were removed after a disasterous preview), and its production design, which many critics found unattractive. Now, in its restored version, we can see the film pretty much as it looked when it came out. Scenes that have not been found are represented by still photographs over which we hear the original dialogue. This is therefore not exactly the movie that was released to the theatres, but a fairly close approximation of it.The story concerns a planeload of passengers hijacked during a violent uprising in China who find themselves ultimately in Tibet, where the plane crashes, and are met by guides who lead them up a steep mountain to the valley of Shanri-La. In Shangri-La the weather is always perfect. There is no war or violence because the people's motto is 'be kind', and they live up to it. In other words, they are in paradise. The valley has a history, too complex to go into in any great depth, and the perfect climate enables its inhabitants to live very long lives.As one might imagine, there is trouble in paradise, and some of the visitors decide to leave. Shangri-La does not automatically make people happy. One still has to work at it, albeit under extraordinarily favorable circumstances. The movie is far from flawless, and the middle section, with the usual romantic stuff, is none too inspired; but it begins with a bang and very nearly ends with one, too. In the chaotic, early scenes there is a palpable sense of danger; and the generous budget enabled Capra to use large crowds, and he makes the most of them. Rarely, on screen, have large numbers of human beings, whether screaming, shooting or pushing, seemed so frightening. The airborne part of the film is likewise very satisfying. There's a good deal of exposition here, but it's so well done that one can scarcely find fault. The scenes of refueling in a remote village are eletrifying, and one isn't sure at first what's going on. Are they being attacked? No, but it takes a while to figure this out. The soaring over the clouds is mesmerizing in its simple beauty; while the crash-landing of the plane at what appears to be the foot of the mountain that leads eventually to Shangri La, is highly effective. And Capra, ever the master of film climate, offers us, briefly, a quite pretty and at the same time literally chilling sense of what it would be like to die, snowbound, in the Himalayas.But Capra's greatest triumph is the scene of hero Conway's departure from the peaceful valley, with his brother and girl-friend in tow. Conway does not want to leave, but his younger brother is in love with a Russian girl, who is unhappy in paradise and talks aginst the locals. As Conway is discussing the matter with his brother, inside, we hear wordless chanting outside, in what sounds like a religious ceremony, as robed figures carrying candles form a long line that surrounds the building, then pass on. As the talk inside becomes more heated, the voices (and accompanying music) grow louder. By the time Conway has made his decision to leave, and is walking up the hill to the opening in the rocks that will lead him from the warm, friendly valley to the freezing tempratures of the outisde world, the music rises in intensity, to a kind of lugubrious, hynoptic crescendo, providing a perfect auditory counterpart to the journey Conway is embarking on, and his mixed feelings about it. The result is one of the single most moving and lovely scenes in movies, technically and emotionally devastatingly effective. Ronald Colman's heartbreak as he gazes back, with as soulful expression as has been seen in movies, is worth seeing the rest of the picture for, and one of the highlights of American film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Colman of Tibet: An attempted key to "LOST HORIZON"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Along with A TALE OF TWO CITIES, THE PRISONER OF ZENDA, and THE LIGHT THAT FAILED, LOST HORIZON represented the best performance possible out of Ronald Colman. And his Robert Conway is the most modern of them (up to the time the films were made). LOST HORIZON is set (as James Hilton intended) in the 1930s, in war torn China. It is not the only reference in the story to the 1930s that Hilton puts into his fable of a paradise on earth.Hilton had reason to fear about the world he lived in. The Great War (as the First World War was generally called in the 1930s) was still a savage and recent nightmare. The 1920s and 1930s saw dictatorships seize control of European and Asian state, and Democracy retreating everywhere. "Look at the world", says the High Lama (Sam Jaffe), "Is anything worse?" The High Lama is correct - the world is collapsing, and the so-called panaceas (Communist Russia, Nazi Germany, Fascist Italy and Spain, Imperial Japan and it's "Greater Asiatic Co-Prosperity Sphere") are worse than the seeming ineptitude and drift in badly divided France, weakened Britain, and recovering American. Hilton took Conway, his brother George, Professor Edward Everett Horton, suspiciously quiet businessman Thomas Mitchell, and consumptive Isabel Elsom to an oasis (possibly the oasis) on that troubled old earth - Shangri La, or "the valley of the Blue Moon") where contentment and peace reigned and people could live, if not forever, far longer and more happily than in say 1937 Germany, Britain, France, Russia, Italy, the U.S., or Japan.On the whole Capra catches the spirit of the novel - his sets were dismissed as being far to simplistic, but as simplicity is the hallmark of life at Shangri-La the critics seemed to miss the point. As a matter of fact, his sets (in a temperate valley in the Himalayas - a real impossibility) are more acceptable than the idiocies of the future world in the contemporary science fiction film THINGS TO COME, where H.G.Wells believes we should live in cities built in caves.The acting is very good, particularly Sam Jaffe's ancient High Lama (always shot in shadows). Remember, he is over two hundred years old. Today, because Jaffe had a long career in Hollywood (despite being blacklisted in the 1950s), we think of him as an old man in THE ASPHALT JUNGLE or as "Dr. Zorba" in the series BEN CASEY. So we think he must have looked old in real life when LOST HORIZON was shot. Actually, he was in his thirties or forties, so he was not that old. But he gave a performance that suggested he was an old man.Another member of the cast that I would wish to bring up for consideration is John Howard. He is not recalled by film fans too much, but Mr. Howard was a good, competent actor. That he played Hugh "Bulldog" Drummond in a series of "B" features in the late thirties makes it ironic that he played the younger brother of Ronald Colman here, who had begun the talking picture segment of his career with the same role. Howard does not have a British accent, but he does show the adoration of the younger brother for his famous sibling, and the growing anger and contempt he develops when brother Robert fails to plan for their leaving this prison they were dragged to - note how he wants to return with a bomber to destroy Shangri-La. It is one of the two roles in major films that John Howard is remembered for, the other being "George Kittridge", the erstwhile fiancé of Tracy Lord (Katherine Hepburn) in THE PHILADELPHIA STORY, who is pushed aside by both Cary Grant and James Stewart.As it is one of Howard's best roles, it is nice that when the film was restored (as well as possible) in the 1980s, Howard (one of the three surviving cast members) was able to appreciate it - many of the missing sequences were his scenes. Howard was very happy at the restoration result.Now, one or two notes that may help appreciate the film a little more. Who is Robert Conway supposed to be? He is called, by the High Lama, "Conway, the empire builder." He is supposedly able to do impossible things - hence the admiration of his brother. When he returns to Shangri-La at the end, the comment of the man telling the story is that Conway's journeys by himself back to his valley was beyond what ordinary men could do. So who is Conway? Well, in 1937, the model for Robert Conway was dead, from a motorcycle accident, for two years. It was, of course, Thomas Edward Lawrence "of Arabia", who had never been in Tibet (officially, anyway) but had served time in the Indian subcontinent area on government business in the 1920s. Quite a model for an empire builder.The character played by Thomas Mitchell is also based on a real person. Harry Barnard's real name (which I have forgotten) is that of an international financier whose vast empire collapsed ruining thousands of investors. It turns out Mitchell's character is based on Samuel Insull, a mid western utilities empire builder (out of Chicago) whose financial doings brought about his collapse in the Great Depression. Insull fled in disguise to Greece, but was found on a dirty freighter, and returned to the U.S. (where he would stand trial for fraud, but be acquitted). Edward Everett Horton's anger at Mitchell when he learned the latter's identity is understandable. Mitchell's involvement in installing new pipes in Shangri-La mirrors Insull's early days, when he was an electrician, and an assistant to Thomas Edison.The use of these two real figures as the basis of the characters helped contemporary audiences to accept the background of the plot of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wonderful Fantasy /Drama - - Just As Good 68 Years Later</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this film many times over the years and it never ceases to amaze me. Perhaps other Capra films are better known, but I don't think they can hold a candle to this one. The cast, every one, turn in stunning performances. In his secondary role as Ronald Colman's brother, I believe John Howard's performance was superb, even among this stellar cast. His career consisted of leads in "B" films (Bulldog Drummond) or usually the second man in "A" films (such as The Philadelphia Story). A talented, highly underrated actor in my view, he was of the opinion that he deserved better roles, such as those of Ronald Colman. I agree. And how about that musical score! THE BEST OF ANY FILM, in my humble opinion. What a treat it is to watch a real gem - - Lost Horizon. Incidentally the film is far better than the book by James Hilton. Could another actor have portrayed Robert Conway as Ronald Colman has? I doubt it, even in that age of excellent actors. The scene where his brother George, aided by the Russian girl, try to convince him that Shangri-La is not what it is, is remarkable for Colman's reaction. He turns away and his face changes from disbelief to uncertainty then to acceptance of their arguments. All this without dialogue. Shortly after he turns to look at Shangri-La for the last time before plunging into the outside world and again, silently, his emotions touch us all. (At least they touch me!) We are very fortunate to have this masterpiece available to us. Now, will future generations recognize this film for what it is? Judging from today's "hits" I really wonder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Painstaking Restoration of a Rarely Seen Classic Reflects True Vision</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of my favorite books growing up was James Hilton's classic 1933 book, "Lost Horizon", and I believe it motivated a great deal of my current wanderlust. Even though I have had the misfortune of seeing the disastrous 1973 musical remake when I was young, the original 1937 film adaptation has been a film I have wanted to see for years, but for whatever reason, it was next to impossible to uncover. Apparently, bastardized versions have shown up on TV through the years. Now we are fortunate to have this 1999 restoration spearheaded by UCLA film archivist Robert Gitt to match as closely as possible to Frank Capra's original 132-minute running time.Similar to what was done with George Cukor's "A Star Is Born", "Lost Horizon" is presented with its complete soundtrack, but missing footage had to be found through other sources, even 16-mm prints recorded from TV broadcasts, and in a few scenes, production stills were sadly the only option to fill in the gaps. Consequently, there is a variable quality to the print, but when one thinks that much of this footage could have been completely lost, the visual lapses are more than forgivable. Now that I have seen Capra's vision of the book, I can now understand why it's a cinematic classic though I have to concede not as timeless as one would hope.The fanciful plot centers on Robert Conway, a top-level English diplomat about to become the Foreign Secretary, who helps refugees and assorted others from war-ravaged China. A motley crew of passengers led by Conway boards a plane that is skyjacked toward the Himalayas where it crash lands in a desolate spot of Tibet. They are eventually met by a sect of locals who takes them to a paradise called Shangri-La. The focus of the story then becomes how each of the plane survivors responds to this utopian existence. With his instantly recognizable mellifluous tone, Ronald Colman is perfectly cast as Conway, the only one who embraces this seemingly perfect haven from the outset. He captures the natural curiosity and open romanticism of his character with his trademark erudite manner.The rest of the cast is a gallery of stock characters fleshed out by the variable quality of the performances. H.B. Warner plays Chang with the requisite serenity of his vague, mysterious character; and Jane Wyatt - two decades before playing the perfect suburban wife and mother in "Father Knows Best" - is surprisingly saucy as Sondra, the young schoolteacher who has Conway brought to Shangri-La. She even has a brief nude swimming scene. John Howard unfortunately overplays the thankless role of Conway's obstreperous brother George to the point where I groan every time he appears on screen. A similar feeling comes over me when I see Edward Everett Horton's overly pixilated and fey turn as Lovett and Sam Jaffe's bug-eyed, ethereal High Lama. Isabel Jewell and Thomas Mitchell fare better as a dying prostitute and a fugitive swindler, respectively.The set designs for the Shangri-La lamasery by Stephen Goossón are intriguing in that they look like a post-modern tribute to Frank Lloyd Wright's prairie architecture, though one could argue that the exteriors also resemble a fancy Miami Beach resort hotel. I also imagine that the isolationist philosophy espoused by the High Lama may have been at odds with pre-WWII patriotic fervor, though the more lingering problem is the racism apparent in the casting (e.g., non-Asians like Warner playing inscrutable Asians) and the portrayal of the Tibetan porters as gun-toting derelicts. However, for all its flaws, the movie has some really stunning camera-work by Joseph Walker, surprisingly masterful special effects (for a near-poverty row studio like Columbia), Dmitri Tiomkin's stirring musical score and a powerful sense of mysticism that gives the film a genuine soul. It is no accident that Capra, the most idealistic of the master filmmakers, helmed this movie because a more cynical mindset could have easily sabotaged the entire venture.The DVD is a wonderful package. First, there is a fascinating photo montage documentary with narration provided by film historian Kendall Miller, which gives a true feeling of how Capra approached the production. Gitt and film critic Charles Champlin provide audio commentary on an alternate track of the film with Gitt very informative about the exhaustive restoration process and Champlin more in awe of the result. There is even an alternative ending included that Columbia chief Harry Cohn insisted on filming and using upon release, but it had thankfully been dropped two weeks later. This is a genuine treat for cinemaphiles, as there are few films that make such a compelling case for seeking out one's personal utopia.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pure movie magic of a rare kind</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think I was about seven or eight years old when I first saw this film, and has always lingered in the back of my mind. This is pure movie magic of a rare kind, and it is surprising how well it holds up today. The story is handled with just the right balance of seriousness and humour, with fine performances throughout, and the timeless message it sends is truly profound. The middle part may be lacking a bit in pacing, but it is a minor quibble, since this, for my money, is a masterpiece. And it still looks great, with impressive set design and an abundance of atmosphere. The finale is simply sublime, and stays in the mind for a long time afterwards, one of my favorite movie moments of all time. A movie everyone should see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Capra gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is not another of Frank Capra's sophisticated, stylish comedies of the era. That might explain the reason that "Lost Horizon" takes a back seat today to "It Happened One Night" and "Mr Deeds Goes to Town", the immensely critically acclaimed comedies of the time. With the theme of the small man triumphing over the big, good over evil, perhaps here Capra was trying to explain idealism over humanity. He believed in the book. In his own words, "It held a mirror up to the thoughts of every human being on earth".Ronald Colman is perfect in his role of Robert, an English diplomat and a leader of the people. Edward Everett Horton was again great in a seemingly bubbling, comic role and Sam Jaffe, later the professor in "The Day the Earth Stood Still" gives a memorable performance as the High Lama, establisher of Shangri-La, the perfect world high above in the Himalayas.Some of the cinematography was absolutely amazing. It was a shame that the film was cut to the extent that footage was lost and stills had to be used in the missing sound track places. The imagery that Capra stirs up for the viewer has certainly fulfilled his vision. The film is a bit long in some parts, but it certainly does not fail to entertain, it merely takes its time to tell a great story.Is there another film from the period that sums up the great human ideal, a perfect world, a better one than the one we already exist in? "Lost Horizon" with its ideals is the film for the thinking person. It thrives on its themes for humanity, of kindness and moderation, stripping away the pretense of our lives. The message is as clear as anything, but maybe we all don't want to realise it, or perhaps we can't.I hope that this movie is never remade for a third time. It is a story that could only be preserved in its own time, for this version has the message that still rings clear today, unspoilt, endearing, so simple. Hollywood will never again be able to recapture what has been already crafted. Capra's neglected movie could scarcely have been more effectively filmed.Rating: 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Fantasy filled film that shows the different facaets of human nature. Beautifully conceived by Frank Capra whose brilliant at making films with sentlemenity as main force. A masterpiece which was brutally cut during its threaitcal run and only recently has the film been somewhat restored. Thus, the complete version of Lost Horizon(1937) is one of many lost classics in history of film. Acting is excellent with everyone giving deep performances. An wonderful story with intriquing spirital symbolisms. Ronald Colman does a marvalous job as the good natured and tolerate Robert Conway. Personally I perfer Lost Horizons(1937) over Its a Wonderful Life(1946) because the main character in the former is more complex.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>British diplomat Ronald Colman and brother John Howard crash a plane with several civilians including Thomas Mitchell deep in the Himalayas and find Shangri-La. The place is literally heaven on Earth, but is it really what it seems? H.B. Warner received an Oscar nomination as the man who runs the beautiful but strange place. Frank Capra's film is really a bit dark and disturbing compared to his other famous ventures. Light-hearted in many ways, but filled with strange undertones and images, "Lost Horizon" is one of those odd films from the late-1930s that conveys some deep messages in unconventional ways. The case could be made about the film's support for communism due to several of the sequences. Good and definitely interesting, "Lost Horizon" remains one of Capra's lesser-known films that still packs a punch 65 years later. 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this film for the first time as a 10 year old and its effects on my willingness to be a optimistic idealist have always been led by my memories of this hope inspiring tribute to the need for the human being to find Heaven in this life. Perhaps Lost Horizon could have been that spark that enabled me to find just that. Like all films from another era do not judge this film for its apparent imperfections, rather for what it offered the audiences of that time (1937), hope that all would be well when man would recognize that his time is always better spent broadening his horizons of understanding. Frank Capra's guides his audiences through danger and turmoil to that place which dreams are made of, when we all make the effort to make it happen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not Capra's best by a mile but...it's a Capra so it's worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have the fortune of knowing 2 things about this movie before I watched it. Lost Horizon was the first book I consciously remember reading as a kid...and....I have seen the hour long interview with Capra that Dick Cavett did with him back in the late 60's where he talks about this film at length.First off I'll say this is not even close to Capra's best work. This film suffers from a lot of tedium to say the least. It just drags on and on. In the interview he did, he mentions this film being screened at 3 1/2 hours long. Can you imagine this film being 3 1/2 hours originally? Well it was and he mentions at the end of the screening that the majority of the comments on the cards at the end were negative. He thought he had created a masterpiece but the audience just didn't get it. Well I can certainly understand because this film was made only 3 years after he book was released and I'm bettin' that most of the audience hadn't read the book before seeing this movie. The audience just didn't understand what the movie was about. Well, he mentions that he decided to just chuck a couple of reels of the film and he was left with what we see today, the 132 minute version. It seemed to work.To me there are no real standout performances in this because the movie just meanders from one thing to another. The start of the tedium is the beginning where the aircraft is stolen. I bet they spend a good 12 to 15 minutes with this aircraft sequence. It's just too darn long. I was lookin at the clock sayin..."when's this scene gonna play itself out?"As good as Ronald Colman is as an actor, he's just secondary to the "idea" of the film. The idea being the concept of living in a place where there's no war..no crime..no hate..no poverty etc. The whole time your watching your trying to wrap your head around it but if you wanna get a better idea of it and really grasp the concept, read the book. It's much better.I was really looking forward to seeing this finally but by the middle of it I was surfing the net and just looking at the screen here and there. It was a film that just didn't capture my attention. I think a lot of it also was that the casting wasn't too special. With the exception Colman and Wyatt, there were no stand out actors. You never really get to know any of the actors well enough because there are so many of them it would have taken the original 3 1/2 hour film to flush it out. Even I wouldn't have wanted to see that cause I can imagine, it would have been even more tedious.This film was well made without a doubt but it was just dead boring to me. I think many tend to think Capra and say well it's him and all is stuff is good but IMO, this was a misfire in his career. It's at the bottom of his list for quality.Read the book then see this film and you'll understand the differences...and my point.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lifelong Inspiration.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was 15 years old when I first read the book "Lost Horizon." At that age one is just emerging from the cocoon of the family in which one spends one's childhood and moving out into the big wide world beyond. I did not like what I saw - the Great Depression, countries trying to recover from the Great War and yet preparing for a new one. I was electrified by the theme of "Lost Horizon" - " haven't you ever dreamed of a place where there was peace and security, where living was not a last struggle but a lasting delight?" Four years later the movie came out and, although it made some changes in the book, it still presents the message effectively. Frank Capra's direction is masterful and the acting is excellent except for a few cases of over-acting by John Howard and Isabel Jewell. I preferred the ending of the film where Conway finally succeeds in returning to Shangri La to the ambiguous ending of the book. Ronald Colman is perfect as Conway and his sessions with the High Lama are transfixing. I'm 93 now and just watched the movie again. I realized that the dream of Shangri La has always been with me and, as Lord Gainsford says in the final scene of the movie, "I believe in it because I want to believe in it." By the way, if you like the book and the 1937 movie, stay away from the monstrous 1971 remake in which "Lost Horizon" was turned into a musical. I walked out on this. Why can't Hollywood leave the classics alone?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Adventure exciting, utopia boring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie starts off as a great adventurous tale of a group of Englishmen (and one woman) being airlifted from a murderous revolution in the Chinese boondocks. Still in the air the next morning they realise that their plane is headed the wrong way. When they alert their pilot they find out that he has been replaced by an armed Chinaman -- they are being hijacked! The plane lands in a desert, is refueled from canisters by a wild tribe or horsemen, continues its journey, until its fuel is spent, and crash-lands in the mountains, killing the mysterious pilot. The five passengers find themselves in a subzero wasteland, with the scantiest chances of survival. And that's where the story begins for good ...Up until this point I loved this movie. Then the story of Shangri-La unfolds, a utopia of moderation, temperance and abundance, and the story inescapably becomes naff and boring because paradises always are. Still, the movie conveys an exciting vision of adventure and parallel reality long before the age of sophisticated SFX and CGI. It's also fascinating to see how every utopia is shaped by the day and age that spawns it -- the idea, for example, that abundance eliminates crime seems naive by modern standards.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A truly wonderful film. I first saw this aged about 6 or 7 in a butchered version on TV nearly 40 years ago. Even then it held me entranced. Now in its almost full version the true beauty of the piece is properly revealed. It is a perfect example of what film can be as an art form which entertains, embraces your imagination and makes you think that there could be a better world. I won't elaborate on the plot as it is well described in other comments / reviews. It should be viewed in the context of its time, after one catastrophic war and with another one already appearing imminent. Yes the plot is unrealistic, yes it is sentimental, but so what!! and to criticise it for this is entirely missing the point. I can find realism (or what philistines think passes for realism) and cynicism in a thousand other grossly inferior movies. I am a middle aged Englishman whose stiff upper lip still quivers in those last few scenes as we cheer Ronald Colman's character to his destiny. There should always be room for films such as this, and it is good to see from other comments that there will always be an audience for it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many people may not be drawn to a film like this because it doesn't involve a lot of conflict, and that lack of conflict does make it slow-going at times, but it's still a beautiful film. The sets are wonderfully designed for a modestly budgeted (though it was a big budget at the time) motion picture. Ronald Coleman is a terrific actor, with a dominant screen presence and a certain strength in his voice. The film delivers a good deal of life lessons, and Shangri-La really does look like a great place to live. They believe in doing everything "in moderation," which is a fine philosophy. No wars, very little conflict, everyone's in good health. Can't complain about a place like that. The ending is especially poignant. One minor flaw is the lack of development of the prostitute. She's the only character who doesn't have an arc, and holds much contempt throughout the whole film. I wanted to know the source of her contempt. I never gathered why she was so whiny. If you want to see a beautiful, feel-good movie with great performances, then "Lost Horizon" is the one to see. My score: 7 (out of 10)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nearly perfect film...in my top 10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those rare films where the original story (in this case by the wonderful James Hilton) is improved for the script. Conway in the film (Ronald Colman) is a successful diplomat and probably next Foreign Secretary. That works very well in the story...making him the target of the kidnapping. Having a love interest is, of course, nearly mandatory for a film, while there is none in the novel. Hence we get a delightful performance from Jane Wyatt (much later of "Father Knows Best").As civil strife erupts in 1935 China, Colman helps many Westerners escape, before escaping himself on a plane with a handful of others...only to be kidnapped in mid-air. While it is a shame that we did not get to see the early scenes shot by Capra due to extensive editing, this is a very exciting beginning to the film. The plane crashes in the Himalayan Mountains, with scenes filmed in a giant ice house so that one would see the breath in the blizzardy weather. The group is rescued by Chang (H.B. Warner), of a local lamasery. Of course, it's a set-up -- the remarkable head lama (Sam Jaffe) knows he is about to die, and he wants Colman to become the new high lama. Colamn and his troupe find the beautiful Shangri-La, an idyllic valley where people live very long lives. Stay, or return to "civilization"? I cannot imagine an actor who could play this role so perfectly as Ronald Colman in a sort of pensive manner. Perfection in acting. Sam Jaffe -- brilliant as the high lama, although his screen time was short. Edward Everett Horton as the comical paleontologist who lets his hair down a bit in Shangri-La. Thomas Mitchell as the swindler turned philanthropist. Isabel Jewell who does well as the unhealthy prostitute brought back to health (and interestingly played the seamstress who Colman went to the guillotine with in "A Tale Of Two Cities". Jane Wyatt great as the love interest. And notably H.B. Warner as the assistant to the high lama...a role for which he was nominated for an Oscar; nice to see him in a heftier role than usual.But I can't compliment everyone. Margo did not impress me. John Howard...well, here he's guilty of either bad acting or over-acting...either way he detracts from the picture. Margo and Howard are why I don't give this film a "10".There are few films that I describe as a "masterpiece". This is one, and in my view, one of the 10 greatest films, particularly considering the year it was made...1937. It is clear that director over-reached here. His "director's cut" lasted 6 hours!!!!! Particularly interesting since Hilton's novel is not particularly long. The documentary accounts on the DVD are very interesting to watch. Very highly recommended film for both watching and having on your DVD shelf!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Utopistic Paradise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On 10 March 1935, the pacifist British diplomat and future Foreign Secretary Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) helps a group of ninety Westerns white people to escape from the Chinese city of Baskul after the beginning of a revolution. He leaves the airport in the last plane with his brother George (John Howard), the geologist Alexander P. Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), the rogue trader Henry Barnard (Thomas Mitchell) and the sick and bitter Gloria Stone (Isabel Jewell). However, the plane is skyjacked and crashes in a remote area in Tibet. When they have no further hope of surviving, they are rescued and brought to the utopistic paradise Shangri-La, a peaceful and plentiful place without illness, war or any type of dispute. Their first sensation is that they are prisoners but along the days, each survivor loves and has no intention to leave the place except George that tries to convince the group to leave Shangri-la."Lost Horizon" is a beautiful and naive fantasy in a period when mankind was strongly divided between the economical principles of Communism and Capitalism. Shangri-la is the utopia of the Communism, with the society plenty of resources and sharing without any dispute. In the present days, most of the characters have silly behaviors as if they were children and the stubborn George is very annoying. Why the British Robert (instead of the native Chang) is supposed to be the new leader is not clear, but it seems to be a justification for the strong British colonialism at those years. The 132 minutes running time DVD, released by the Brazilian distributor Columbia, was restored by Sony Pictures Entertainment in cooperation with UCLA Film and Television Archive. Unfortunately, seven minutes are lost, but the use of dialogs and pictures gives the complete comprehension of the scenes to the viewer. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): "Horizonte Perdido" ("Lost Horizon")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but with a strange fascination</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably of all of Frank Capra's successes from the Thirties this is the most dated. Dated simply because we know so much more about Tibet than we did in 1933 when James Hilton's book came out. Hard to watch it now and realize that probably the Communist Chinese government has taken over Shangri-La and kicked out Ronald Colman, H.B. Warner and the rest of the cast, bag and baggage. They'd still be with us you know, if you accept the premise of longevity in the book.Lost Horrizon was an enormously popular book in the Thirties. There was lots of strife at that time, economic and military. People liked to think there was some place we could just get away from it all. The same longing also sparked the success of Brigadoon in the immediate postwar years on Broadway.The U.S. President commented obliquely on the enormous popularity of Lost Horrizon when he was asked where did James Doolittle's bombers come from? Where was the secret base? Franklin Roosevelt replied with a chuckle, "Shangri La."James Hilton spent the last years of his life writing screenplays in Hollywood and I'm absolutely certain that he wrote this, Goodbye Mr. Chips and Random Harvest with the casting in mind. It's why I think Ronald Colman is so right for the part. A man of the British Empire with a secret longing for a better world than he's living in and dealing with. Ronald Colman and a few others in a small passenger plane are highjacked during a revolutionary uprising and are transported to the mountains of Tibet. The kidnappers are the residents of a mystical valley where due to climate, the aging process has been dramatically slowed. Slowed but not halted. The aging High Lama, Sam Jaffe and his assistant H.B. Warner think that Colman is the kind of man they want to succeed Jaffe who has passed his 200 year.Supporting Colman are Frank Capra regulars Edward Everett Horton and Thomas Mitchell. Additionally Jane Wyatt is in the cast for romance. Her character is not in Hilton's book. Capra gets good performances from his cast. One in particular I like is Isabell Jewell who was a passenger on the highjacked plane. She's a party girl who's excesses have made her seriously ill. Shangri La gives her hope and redemption, physically and morally.As more and more of planet earth becomes known to us, novels like Lost Horrizon will be unable to be written. There are so few places on this planet that man hasn't trod his foot on. But even knowing so much more of Tibet, due in no small measure to it's exiled leader, the Dalai Lama's pleas for autonomy, Lost Horrizon is still a fascinating film to watch.Question, do you think the Dalai Lama has ever read the book or seen this film?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"The other side of the hill"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The second half of the 1930s saw the return of the big picture - bigger budgets, grander ideas, longer runtimes in which to tell a story. But the 30s were also a decade of highly emotional and humanist cinema, fuelled by the hardships of the great depression. Lost Horizon sees what was for the time a rare marriage between burgeoning picture scope, in what was "poverty row" studio Columbia's most expensive production to date, and poignant intimacy in the source novel by James Hilton.Thank goodness for director Frank Capra, who seemed really able to balance this sort of thing. Capra could be a great showman, composing those beautiful iconic shots to show the magnificent Stephen Goosson art direction off to best advantage. But he also knows how to bring out a touching human story. In some places Capra's camera seems a trifle distant, and is almost voyeuristic as it peeps out through foliage or looming props. But rather than separate us from the people it is done in such a way as to give a kind of respectful distance at times of profound emotion, for example when Ronald Colman comes out of his first meeting with the High Lama. The camera hangs back, just allowing Colman's body language to convey feelings. At other times Capra will go for the opposite tack, and hold someone in a lengthy close-up. In this way we are given to just one facet a character's emotional experience, and it becomes all the more intense for that.Of course such techniques would be nothing without a good cast. There couldn't really have been anyone better than Ronald Colman for the lead role. Now middle-aged, but still possessed with enough charm and presence to carry a movie, Colman has a slow subtlety to his movements which is nevertheless very expressive. His face, an honest smile but such sad eyes, seems to be filled with all that hope and longing that Lost Horizon is about. Sturdy character actors H.B. Warner and Thomas Mitchell give great support. It's unusual to see comedy player Edward Everett Horton in a drama like this, and comedy players in dramas could often be a sour note in 1930s pictures, but Horton is such a lovable figure and just about close enough to reality to pull it off. The only disappointing performance is that of John Howard, who is overwrought and hammy, but even this works in a way as it makes his antagonistic character seem to be the one who is out of place.Lost Horizon is indeed a wondrous picture, and one that fulfils its mission statement of being both sweeping and soul-stirring. It appears that Capra, always out for glory, was out to make his second Academy Award Best Picture. But history was to repeat itself. In 1933 he had had his first go at a potential Oscar-winner with The Bitter Tea of General Yen, only for that picture to be ignored and the more modest It Happened One Night to win the plaudits the following year. Lost Horizon won two technical Oscars, but bombed at the box office, but in 1938 the down-to-earth comedy drama You Can't Take it with You topped the box office and won Best Pic.Lost Horizon was in no way worthy of such a dismissal, and is indeed a bit better than You Can't Take it with You. It was perhaps more than anything a case of bad timing. Audiences were only just starting to get used to two-hour-plus runtimes, especially for movies with such unconventional themes. If you look at contemporary trailers and taglines, you can see it was being pitched as some kind of earth-shattering spectacular, whereas it is more in the nature of an epic drama. For later releases the movie was edited down to as little as 92 minutes. Fortunately, we now have a restored version. The additional material that has been reconstructed is vital for giving depth, not only to the characters, but also to the setting of Shangri-La itself. With hindsight, we can look back on Lost Horizon as a work of real cinematic beauty.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented the restored version of this film. The restored version contained Capra's ending. There isn't that much difference between the two endings, but Capra's is better. Capra creates saccharine films that get in the way of the story, or maybe that's just a 2006 viewpoint. I still enjoyed this film. Others on this board have referenced the darkness in the book, and have peaked my curiosity about the book. Maybe Capra just isn't inclined to show darkness in his films. No matter, it's a wonderful film.I certainly would not classify this movie as an old movie, because there is nothing else like it. I would suggest the High Lama's main speech is a radical interpretation of the Sermon on the Mount, and you don't find many movies with similar themes. The restored version contains those portions of the speech that were edited in other versions. The liner notes reference the film as too much of a peace statement at the time of its making. It's too much of a peace statement in 2006. The commentary included in the DVD states the film was first show at a length of 3 ? hours. I would have liked to have seen all that footage.Unfortunately the restored version was pieced together and we see variations in the footage, variations that call attention to the difference. Too bad. Joseph Walker's and Elmer Dyer's filming is beautiful. These "black and white" guys new what they were doing. There work is timeless. Thank you all (Robert Gitt of UCLA and Sony) who patiently restore their work. For me, movies LIVE in 35 mm, black and white. This one did not disappoint, although as mentioned, some of the original negative has been lost. Fitting, really, for a movie titled, "Lost Horizon". I see Capra's last shot ? it's beautiful!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>That Rarest of Things: a Spiritually Mature Film from Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the more spiritually mature films to come out of Hollywood, Lost Horizon can actually be read as a Bildungsroman of sorts, due to the way that it traces the spiritual and moral growth of the main character, Robert Conway. The classification is imperfect as Conway had clearly begun his journey towards enlightenment some time prior to the start of the film's events and he is already a physically mature adult, not the teenager or very young man most commonly depicted in this kind of story.Nevertheless, it is his spiritual awakening that is the central focus here as he goes from being a soldier-diplomat (an oxymoron if ever there was one) and upholder of a Pax Romana-type of peace to a proponent of true peace, a pacifist and ultimately, the appointed future leader of Shangri-La.After an unspecified spiritual crisis that leads him to question and reject his immoral career, he awakens more and more to the reality of just how corrupt is the worldly system of State- and institutional-held power that he has supported his entire adult life.Thus, he seeks to reform his life and reject the military and searches for something far better. However, his initial search is fruitless; he is not drawn to Shangri-La; rather, it seeks him out and draws him towards it. In this way, the film takes on a theological tone that is closest to Calvinism in terms of notions of Total Depravity and Irresistible Grace.Once in Shangri-La, Conway and several others who accept the simplicity and spiritual fulfilment of the pacifist lifestyle find themselves grow from being guests to integral members of the community, each contributing to the growth of the kingdom in some way. The fraudulent failed businessman and swindler Barnard, the implied-homosexual Lovett and even the former soldier Conway are able to renounce their evil pasts and are given a chance to contribute good to the kingdom.Also interesting is the notion that Shangri-La is a place where Eastern and Western religions meet. Founded by a Belgian priest, he works with the native people to establish the utopian kingdom in the valley.Interestingly, for the time, the native people have some (albeit limited) voice. Chang, although played by a Western actor is presented as one of the Tibetans. The film confounds expectations in that the hijacker's actions initially lead the audience to think his intentions are sinister whilst he is actually taking them to the utopian world, an action that will cost him his own life in the process.Whilst the acting in this film is halting and slightly dated, the special effects remain impressive to this day. Moving from the tumult, unpredictability and violence of revolution, the viewer travels with Conway to the sanctuary of the world as it was meant to be where simplicity and harmony are valued over politics and the meek really do rule the kingdom.The pacifism on display is backed by this spiritual vision and provides a true alternative to the kind of "peace" promoted by the nation-state. The anti-war movement, both secular and Christian, had reached its first peak at this time, with groups such as the Peace Pledge Union and Anglican Pacifist Fellowship at the height of their popularity in Europe and working alongside pacifist politicians, such as George Lansbury and prominent activists and writers including Aldous Huxley, Vera Brittain, Dick Sheppard and Evelyn Underhill towards constructive peace, including pragmatic work to ban bomber aircraft and most critically to defuse tensions with Germany and lessen the Treaty of Versailles. It is within this discourse of peace that this film can be situated. Like all utopian/dystopian science fiction, it presents an alternative system of government as a way of reflecting on the shortcomings of our real world western systems, shortcomings that would become all too apparent over the next half-decade in the most tragic of fashions.It is a heart-breaking pity that the director, Frank Kapra, later rejected his own vision projected so well here to create a string of nauseating World War Two propaganda films.The end of the film presents a pilgrim's progress of sorts as Conway must climb his mountains and overcome obstacles to return to the kingdom he so fleetingly experienced. The juxtaposition here between the material world of his fellow diplomats pondering his quest in London and his spiritual journey is striking and masterfully handled.This film, despite its age and shortcomings remains that rarest of things: an essential Hollywood film and one that people need to watch in this day and age as an antidote to the State-held ideology of Pax Americana. Highly recommended not just to Christians and other pacifists but to all those troubled in these times of (like the 1930s) increasingly militarised and nationalistic nation-states.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had the pleasure of seeing Capra's "Shangri-La" on DVD, the version restored by joint effort of the UCLA film archive and Sony Pictures. They searched the world for remaining prints and were able to restore all of the sound and all but 7 minutes of the picture representing the original 132-minute version, and the results are remarkable. (The first rough cut was 5 hours!) The 7 minutes use still photos of the actors which works out quite well. Although set mostly in a remote valley in Tibet, where everyone is happy and the aging process virtually comes to a standstill, most of it was filmed in and around Hollywood, including a giant cold-storage warehouse cooled to sub-freezing temperatures for the high altitude airplane scenes, and some of the mountain scenes. The extras on this DVD, of the making of the film and of the restoration process, are some of the best on any DVD. A superb classic that will never get old.SPOILERS are contained in the remaining comments, be forewarned. Bob Conway (Ronald Colman) was a British 'soldier, diplomat, and public hero', in Baskul, China in 1935 to help get '90 white people' out of China before the warring killed them. But his plane was hijacked by a Tibetan pilot who was bringing him, his brother George, and three others to an unknown destination. After a refueling stop in the desert, the plane resumes but runs out of fuel, crashes on a snowy high mountain, where they are rescued and led to the beautiful, warm valley they came to know as Shangri-La. When Bob finally meets the mysterious High Lama (Sam Jaffe), who claims to be over 200 years old, it is explained that Sondra (Jane Wyatt, 25, of eventual 1950s 'Father Knows Best' fame) had requested him after reading his books. The High Lama was ready to die, which he does in the presence of Bob, instructing Bob that Shangri-La is now in his care. Later Bob learns some things that make him doubt, he agrees to escape with his brother, guided by Sherpa, who begin to shoot at them, causing an avalanche, killing all of the Sherpa. Then, Maria who they took with them, begins to turn into an old woman, as predicted when someone has lived in Shangri-La and avoided the aging process. George become mad, jumps to his death, Bob tries to get back to Shangri-La but cannot find his way, eventually is found in a remote Chinese Mission, with memory loss, is about to sail to England, remembers, jumps ship and spends most of a year trying to find Shangri-La again, and as his hunter recounts, last time he saw Bob, he 'disappeared over a mountain pass', eventually made it back to Shangri-La.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra classic about a group of British citizens, led by diplomat Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), who flee a rebellion in China only to have their plane crash in the Himalayas. They are taken to Shangri-La, a magical place isolated in the mountains where people can leave behind the worries of civilization. They learn they will live for hundreds of years there but only if they never leave. The world-weary Conway is intrigued by the promise of this utopia but not everyone in his group feels the same way.It's an ambitious undertaking for Capra, who made no other movies on the scale of this one (or with the budget). The costumes and Art Deco sets are beautiful. Great script from Robert Riskin, adapted from James Hilton's novel. Lovely, haunting score from Dimitri Tiomkin. Ronald Colman, an exceptional actor who never did a bad job that I've seen, gives a moving, sincere performance that ranks among the best of his impressive career. Sam Jaffe is also excellent in his small but important role as the High Lama. The rest of the wonderful cast includes John Howard, Jane Wyatt, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Isabel Jewell, and Thomas Mitchell (the first of four movies he did with Capra). Jane Wyatt's swimming scene is probably the sexiest thing she ever did on film. The opening scenes are exciting and the climax is powerful. The middle of the film is where many people complain that it's slow or that it loses focus. I admit there is a chunk of the middle of the film, dealing with Colman and Wyatt falling in love, as well as everyone adjusting (or not adjusting) to Shangri-La that drags just a bit. But I never felt bored and I don't think it derails the film at all. The dialogue and performances in these scenes is still great. The original cut ran much longer and I can only imagine whether that version would be better or worse. As it is, seven minutes of footage is still missing from the current version. The dialogue for these scenes is intact, with production stills in place of the missing footage.It's escapism, pure and simple. Many viewers will poke holes in the idea and philosophy behind Shangri-La, calling it naive and childish. Perhaps they're right; perhaps the cold, cynical reality of selfish human nature means such a utopia is impossible. But the thing about most of Frank Capra's films, and why he is probably my favorite director ever, was that he believed in telling uplifting, optimistic stories about us helping each other overcome our baser nature; that good can triumph over evil and there are such things as happy endings. While Lost Horizon is not really one of his "Capra-corn" movies, I think the basic Capra elements are still there, right down to the final shot. Most other directors would have likely gone for the sad or tragic ending, but Capra gives us one that is hopeful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Frank Capra directs this appealing fantasy that stars Ronald Colman as British diplomat Robert Conway, who is evacuated from a troubled country by plane with other refugees. They get to know each other en route, but unfortunately the plane is sabotaged, and it crash lands in the Himalayas, where they later discover an Eden-like society hidden by mountains called Shangri-La, where everyone is cared for, and all outside conflicts(like the looming world war) are irrelevant. Most of the refugees settle down to this place, and Robert even meets the high lama(played by Sam Jaffe) whom he has great respect for. Problems arise when one of them is determined to leave, and takes an unhappy citizen(played by Margo) with him. Robert feels obligated to go with them, but a terrible truth about staying there will be learned, as Robert vows to later return to Shangri-La, no matter how long it takes...Moving and appealing film is beautifully directed and acted, showing us a wonderful place that anyone would want to stay in, making Conway's desperate fight to return there quite compelling. Unusual film isn't without flaws, but is still most worthwhile, with a welcome ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilton, Capra and Riskin: The Perfect Match and Great Acting Performances in Idealistic Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is Frank Capra at his best (and he's "at his best" in so many of his classics!), and he gets even better when his source material for a movie is as exquisite as James Hilton's famous original novel. You can feel there's a *lot more* behind this movie than what got into the final cut usually shown today -- the restored version of around 127 minutes. There's an overabundance, richness and depth of material to choose from -- after all, the initial cuts of the movie were 3.5 hours, or even 6 hours long. Too bad none of that footage is available today -- it would be a delight to watch.Capra, his screenwriter of many movies Robert Riskin, and Hilton are all "tuned to the same wave length", so what comes out is undiluted joy and harmony. Even if you don't know that Capra sometimes took *days* to shoot a single scene of a few minutes' length (overshooting his budget outrageously, and almost bankrupting Columbia studios), the tremendous care on his part is palpable throughout: he pays as much attention to action-packed scenes, as to properly leading the actors in every piece of dialogue.The actors' performances are as spectacular in _Lost Horizon_ as is the snow-deluged, but then again sunny and paradise-like, scenery. Ronald Colman is riveting as Robert Conway, and you can see why Capra only counted on him to play the role; there is, in particular, one pivotal scene of about 40 seconds' length, with the character of Conway considering whether to stay in Shangri-La; there's absolute silence throughout the scene -- but the play of expressions on Colman's face is fascinating; his face is like a mirror of his mind, or like the sky with clouds passing over it; I'm not sure if all of that was just Colman's improvisation or Capra's direction, but the scene may be the movie's top highlight.The other two actors present in that pivotal scene, John Howard (as the leading character's angst-ridden brother) and Margo (as the Russian "girl" Maria), are thoroughly convincing, too; the *intensity* with which they enact the two characters, is overpowering. So much so, that watching _Lost Horizon_ becomes incredibly suspenseful, surprising the viewer at every turn -- there seems to be a "new twist" every 5 minutes or so (particularly towards the end), as if _Lost Horizon_ was a mystery movie. You have a central leading character here (Robert Conway), in between two opposed sets of characters, each group trying to pull him in a different direction, claiming that *that's* where *true civilization* lies. Which way is Bob going to go? You're never really sure! The credit for that must go to both Colman and the fantastic actors portraying both sides of the divide -- you're as apt to "fall for" each of the two groups, as Bob's character did, at one stage or another.There are magnificent performances from others, too. It's as if Capra was able to squeeze the best out of every actor -- regardless of whether they only appear on the screen for a few minutes. Hugh Buckler only gets a few minutes of screen-time towards the end as Lord Gainsford, but how compelling is he! Thomas Mitchell has so many top-shelf movies to his credit, including possibly the greatest movies of all time (such as _Gone with the Wind_ and Capra's own _It's a Wonderful Life_), but nowhere have I seen him -- primarily a character actor -- shine so much as here in _Lost Horizon_ as the swindler Barnard. Isabel Jewell is similarly affecting as a terminally (?) ill patient getting rejuvenated by Barnard's (virtuously redirected) energy.H. B. Warner is wonderful as Chang, and makes the miracle of Shangri-La seem believable. His statement on the Westerners' celebration of birthdays is delivered unforgettably, as are others. The most difficult role in _Lost Horizon_ was that of the High Lama, played by Sam Jaffe. It's not surprising Capra went to extreme lengths (even swapping actors at one point) to get the High Lama's scenes right, and he eventually did. Although during _Lost Horizon_ previews the audience laughed at scenes meant to be serious, which drew Capra into depression, I believe that in the restored version of _Lost Horizon_ commonly shown today, the High Lama scenes strike just the right point to be perceived as serious and moving, while avoiding (just barely, but they do!) slipping into the ridiculous.The movie, besides being visually spectacular despite only being shot in black-and-white, also seems surprisingly fresh and bold for the standards of 1937 when it was made. Capra certainly didn't hesitate to show whatever he wanted to show: a naked Jane Wyatt (another great performance!) cavorting in a stream; a horde of naked children; and the High Lama extolling "Christian" virtues -- neither of which features would probably be considered politically correct today.The character of Sondra, enchantingly played by Jane Wyatt, is particularly admirable in that it was the film-makers' invention -- Sondra does not appear in Hilton's original book. On the superficial level, it's *just* the type of character that you might expect a clichéd Hollywood production to insert into the screen version of a novel, to make it more conventionally appealing; but in Riskin's and Capra's capable hands, clichés turn into magic, pure gold. See not only the nude bathing scene, but also the "Why?!" scene with Conway playfully "wringing the neck" of his beloved.Watching _Lost Horizon_, even 70+ years after it was made, is like getting a breath of that fresh mountain air that is alleged to keep you forever young in body and spirit in Shangri-La. Watching _Lost Horizon_ makes you feel as if you paid a visit to Shangri-La yourself -- can there be a higher achievement for an artist in any type of art?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A British statesman on the eve of WW-II retreats from the world that has lost its horizon.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Last night I watched a DVD rental of the restoration of this classic movie, and was reminded of how I and the other students of San Luis Obispo High School had been privileged to watch what, in retrospect, was a pre-release test by the studio for teen-agers' reactions. This took place at the Elmo theater and probably occurred in 1936, the first half of my senior year. Which are deductions on my part resulting from the fact that in February 1937 our high school coach had ordered me to pay for my shiny new orange and black basketball uniform which the team's star had stolen from my locker, and sent me to the principal when I indignantly declined to do so. The principal ordered me to leave school and not return until I paid.In 1937 they mailed me my diploma and I was able to enroll at Cal Poly. In the meanwhile I had a number of jobs and wonderful days on the beach and evenings at the Stag pool hall and a voyage to Japan working on a Swedish oil tanker. Our high school also got to see Romeo and Juliet, which was released in 1938, and reinforces my conclusion that we were a testing location for the studios. I recall one of our high school wags, at the play's most dramatic scene, "Romeo,my Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo," calling out, "Heah ah is, Sunshine." Which brought down the house. God only knows what the studio execs made of this. Curiously, we are just about ready to publish a novel titled "Paper Doll," about a half baked psychiatrist who, along with several of his patients, lost their horizons in their struggles for dominance with a young hooker.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Enjoyable--beautifully filmed movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the restored version of this film, and enjoyed it very much. I thought it was a good movie about a rather idealized hero in a very thirties style, but at the same time it had many aspects of the archetypal hero's journey of spiritual awakening, which made the experience of the movie more interesting and resonant. Ronald Coleman is just perfect for his part.I can imagine that after WWI the idea of such a place with no reason for conflict was extremely attractive to movie audiences everywhere. It must have been almost heartbreaking to leave the theatre after this movie and step into the streets of Berlin, for instance.The sets and mountain scenes are just great. I got a real feeling of cold and danger in those mountains.Certainly there is some material that is dated or otherwise a bit jarring to the modern sensibility; white people are taken to be more important than any other people with a breathtaking assurance, and the "ethereal" performance by Sam Jaffe is a bit much for my taste, but when watching a movie one adjusts to the world of the movie or has a bad time.I thought Bob's brother George was very annoying. Panicky, selfish, with no interior life, he is all fear and no thought.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning for idealistic types: You will love it!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comes from a most idealistic person that still strives to believe in the possibility of a really human world where the man stops being a wolf to the man (Hobbes, I think). I rediscovered this movie last year in Xmas day, and the message resonated all inside my heart and soul. Anyone writing about utopias should check this out, although the book probably is more extensive. I haven't read it yet, I am afraid.At some point when all of the Europeans are discussing the good OR the evil of Shangri-La, I could see the scenification of the intellectual discussion taking place at the time (1937) in difficult times for the world. That was between the faith and trust or the cynical and sceptical point of views, to simplify it. Bertrand Russell words came to mind, and the realisation that even if utopia would find a place in our world, there would be those that would not want to take place, that would find the struggle and the rat race attractive probably out of inexperience.And definitely Capra makes his statement about the upcoming war. Chapeau, Frank!! I love the so-called capra-esquire films because of their intense belief in the strenght of the human being when he decides to do to the neighbours as he would like to be done onto him. Deeply spiritual message, the conscience that we are all one.From a human being struggling in this world...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>So different from Hilton's novel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing this movie again the other night on TV, I decided to reread the novel, which I hadn't read in almost 50 years. What I discovered was that the movie is RADICALLY different from the novel, in the following ways:1. Characters Edward Everett Horton's character was a complete creation of the script writers; in the novel there are only four Europeans on the plane, not five. Conway's brother is, in the novel, a younger colleague. The woman, rather than being a lady with a questionable past, is a woman member of the London Missionary Society. And Conway himself, though he has largely the same character as in the movie, is in the novel just another undistinguished minor government functionary, not a distinguished author and diplomat about to be appointed foreign secretary. Only the American, played by Th Mitchell in the movie, is about the same in both works. There is no real romantic interest for Conway in the novel - which, by the way, has a recurring homosexual hint to it. Jane Wyman's character in the movie was a complete creation of the script writers, as was Horton's. 2. PlotFrom there on, more is similar. In the novel the High Lama had not chosen to bring Conway to Shangri-La because of his writings, but once he gets to know Conway he decides to make him his successor, as in the movie. Again, the purpose of Shangri-la is to provide a place for contemplation during a forthcoming holocaust. The novel's Conway was deeply affected by World War I, an element left out of the movie, and that makes the desire to avoid the terrors of the next one easier to understand. Since there is no romantic interest for Conway in the novel, his desire to return to Shangri-la after he agrees to accompany his colleague and the young woman out is strictly a result of his eagerness to be part of the Shangri-la community; he is not going back to a lost love as in the movie. The character in the novel, Lo-Tsen, on whom the movie's Maria is based is a much less important character; we never actually see her speak.Nor in the novel do the other Westerners who decide to stay in Shangri-la develop that very Frank Caprian love of helping their fellow men. The missionary wants to convert the "heathens" and the crook wants to mine the gold. Rather to my surprise, I found that I enjoyed the book less than the movie. This is one case where the Hollywoodization was an improvement.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Externalizes the Shangri-La that has always been with us. "A Dream Given Form" (B5).</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Of special interest in the film: "I believe in [Shangri-La] because I want to believe". Also compelling is the feeling of momentum or collectivism ... some might say the downside of such a place is that it reeks of socialism. However, there is a feeling (perhaps fallacy) that if only the seed of civilization were changed, its entire nature could be transformed ... much like the seed crystal that determines which of the many possible sub-structures will form the entire matrix. This is the essence of Shangri-La: physical isolation combined with fundamentally different founding principles recreating something magical and primordial.I think Lost Horizon perfectly embodies the legend or archetype of Utopia... of a quiet, timeless place, cut off from the influence and corruption of the outside world. The mountains which block the horizon from Shangri-La may symbolize the loss of our baser impulses, what some would call original sin.It feels a bit like Robert Conway, the celebrated soldier and diplomat in the story, has earned his place in paradise. He is deserving of it due to his service to the outside world, and also because he has always believed in it and yearned for it. In this respect, Shangri-La has always been a part of him, and he of it (I think comments to this effect are made in the film).Viewed this way, his memorable deeds of heroism and diplomacy in the outside world make more sense because even a small part Shangri-La is powerful. Yet it is not powerful enough to quickly and single-handedly change the momentum of the entire world (over decades, perhaps). The key here is the power of attitude, conviction, and values. If you believe in something like Shangri-La strongly enough, and embrace it as a part of you, it starts to become real for you. This is because its natural merit is reflected in your thoughts, and thoughts become actions. For you alone, the world's transformation begins immediately because you see it through new eyes.In spite of these things, there can be no doubt that even the most powerful convictions and positive attitudes are often swept away by a drastic reduction in security (e.g. war or economic disaster). Evolution's legacy binds us.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Utopian society isolated in the Himalayans welcomes group of plane-crash survivors who are alternately pleased to find refuge there and yet are suspicious of their new home. Handsome film-version of James Hilton's novel was shown in butchered prints for years, and was finally restored to almost its original form by the American Film Institute in 1979 (some missing scenes are represented by stills and the soundtrack only). It's a worthy job for a sterling movie, despite some hammy overacting by Edward Everett Horton and occasionally overwrought melodramatics. Jane Wyatt's skinny-dipping scene can still raise eyebrows, though she's enchanting and the sequence is beautifully filmed. Remade (quite well) with music in 1973. *** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A window on pacifism</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>_Lost Horizon_ puts into the mouths of a British diplomat and a self-made Lama the humanistic hope that humanity can be perfected, indeed, will be perfected, by practicing good manners and patiently waiting for the alpha males to kill off each other. As the Lama puts it, "the Christian Ethic will then be realized, and the meek will inherit the Earth." He does not mean that Christianity is true, only that the teachings of Jesus, some of them, anyway, are cool. This was one of Hollywood's first forays into New Age propaganda, an uncritical mix of Eastern mysticism and Unitarian pacifism. Shangri-La reveals some beautiful Bauhaus architecture. I suppose, being filmed in 1937, it was intended to look futuristic and timeless. We are also presented with free love, easy divorce, and universal day care as important lanes of the highway to Utopia. If you watch this film, notice that the Lama evades and never answers Conway's question about what is to be done if life really is pointless. No one asks how one gets to live in the nice Bauhaus administration building (with imported furniture) instead of working in the valley below carrying water in buckets. As with most other Utopias presented in film and literature, this society has an unusual source of wealth that funds all this happiness. In Shangri-La, gold is laying around like so many rocks, which allows them to trade for upscale furniture with a caravan that comes by every few years. (In _Twenty-One Balloons_, Krakatoa has diamonds to support its economy. The Dem's Utopia would have "the rich" to support it. I wonder what happens after the rich get soaked -- but I digress.) The acting is not bad for a Capra film. Still, I guess _Lost Horizon_ gets high votes because that many viewers agree with its message. Yes, it would be a much better world if people were just nice. The question is how we can get people to be nice. Moore, Marx, Dewey, Hilton (the author of _Lost Horizon_), and Pol Pot have all tried to answer that question (respectively: communism, communism, socialism, just BE nice and let the not-nice people kill off each other, communism), but with poor results. Being nice is a good idea. Relationships are everything--living in communion with God and with one's neighbors is the meaning of life. However, there will always be plenty of not-nice people, no matter how nice other people are to them. _Lost Horizon_ belongs in the Museum of Yesterday's Tomorrows. It's a good way to peek at what intellectuals were presenting as the answer to the world's problems in 1937. The seventy years since then have shown some of the results, but, unfortunately, the learning curve among the cultural leadership seems to be relatively flat. I give LH a 5 mainly for its interest as a cultural artifact. As entertainment, it is pretty boring.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Special effects today play an important role in most movies today and they are all pretty much computer generated. However, back in the 30's and 40's before computers, special effects were borne out of the minds and hearts of talented individuals who relied ultimately on imagination and physical hard work to achieve similar, if not better results. As a young girl, seeing the movie Lost Horizon made me think that paradise on earth could be a reality was also due to the acting talents of such actors as Ronald Coleman, Jane Wyatt (Father Knows Best) and others. The acting talents, in addition to its special effects, made Lost Horizon not only entertaining, but made paradise on earth a future reality in my mind and heart.I hope there will not be a remake.

		<fullReview>Frank Capras exquisite look at paradise on Earth . From the James Hilton novel of "Lost Horizon" comes this tale of refuge on Earth, a lamasery in the remote High Himalayas. Governed by the High Lama(Sam Jaffe) Shagri-la is the ultimate in contentment, serenity ,and peace . The perfect environ to while away your time, because you'll have plenty of it. See, you live longer due to the lack of stress and harshness that plagues the outside world. Exquisitely and painstakingly photographed, the richness and fullness of this mythical village are not lost, but fully developed and embellished. Robert Conway(Ronald Colman),British Dipomat and WWI survivor are kidnapped and flown into the Himalayas for a date with destiny. His presence has been summoned by the High Lama. The other passengers on the plane struggle with their desires to either stay or embark on treacherous trip back to modern civilization. Geroge Conway(John Howard) is the never satisfied malcontent brother, who demands to leave. Robert acquiesces and the descent begins.Sondra(Jane Wyatt) is the love interest to Robert, and Maria(Margo) is the same to George, except she also wants to leave. This is a wonderful story of struggle , redemption, love lost, love regained.Capra deliciously captures this story perfectly. 10 out of 10 stars, ironic that an originally 6 hour film have 'Lost" footage.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There's no doubt that this is a most elaborate, major production, blessed with fine acting, directing, scoring, design and other values. The trouble I have in entirely connecting with it is Hilton's "message" of this land of milk and honey, where everything is "perfect."It's a wonderful idea, and there may be such a place--let's hope so. But the High Lama's goal of having this utopia physically spread throughout the entire world is but a pipe dream. We on planet earth are in a dimension of relativity, where there are and must be choices. It's our destiny and there's no escaping it. Accordingly, there will always be positives and negatives in our realm, and no literal Shangrila will ever come to pass as Hilton so conceives. What's interesting is that our world situation today is not much different from that of the thirties. Umpteen years from now, it'll probably be the same. So we'd all better get ourselves together and make the most of our lives through appropriate thinking and action. As for as world ownership is concerned, it's whoever has the biggest club--both the kind you wield and the kind you join.In the meantime, we can play s "Lost Horizon" DVD and Judy Garland CD singing of that "land way up high, heard of once in a lullaby."</fullReview>

Lovett, the rogue trader Henry Barnard and the sick and bitter Gloria Stone.They soon notice the plane is skyjacked and it crashes in a remote area in Tibet.They notice they have found Shangri-la, an utopistic paradise that's not on the map.You don't find illness there, no war or any type of dispute.They didn't get there by accident.They were brought there on purpose, as they soon find out.The place is led by a nearly 200- year old lama.Robert becomes fascinated by the place and wants to stay, and so do the others, except for brother George.Robert also meets the enchanting Sondra there.Lost Horizon from 1937 is based on James Hilton's novel, which I haven't read and it's directed by Frank Capra.Of Capra's works this is not my favorite.But it still is a mighty fascinating look inside this utopian world that doesn't exist.Ronald Colman is brilliant as Robert Conway.And so is John Howard playing George Conway.Jane Wyatt gives a delightful performance as Sondra Bizet.H.B. Warner plays Chang and he's great.Sam Jaffe is terrific as the High Lama.Edward Everett Horton is very good as Lovett, also known as 'Lovey'.He's called that by Henry Barnard, who's brilliantly played by Thomas Mitchell.Isabel Jewell is wonderful as Gloria Stone.Margo is great as Maria, who spends time with George and wants to leave with him.The movie has a lot of good stuff.I recommend you visit Shangri-la and see how you like it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job than Ronald Colman as the idealistic, world weary hero of James Hilton's classic novel; beautifully captured on film by director Frank Capra. The detail and care that went into making this famous film are evident from the beginning, with the hair-raising escape by airplane from a Chinese town filled with hysterical mobs and gun toting revolutionaries. When the plane crash lands in the middle of nowhere in Tibet, the stunned passengers who had been hijacked by the now dead pilot have no idea what to do, until a rescue party arrives on the scene and takes them to the mountain valley paradise of Shangri-La. This green and peaceful spot is sheltered from the fierce storms outside its craggy entrance and the inhabitants live contented, serene lives.Conway is increasingly attracted to Shangri-La and its way of life, but his enthusiasm is not shared by his brother or all the other visitors. Things get more complicated as Conway falls in love with a woman from the valley, and his younger brother plots to escape. When Conway is summoned to a meeting with the very old High Lama, he learns many secrets about Shangri-La, but the future is very uncertain, both for the world and the people of the valley. Conway's decision whether to leave or stay will affect the whole future of Shangri-La, leading to a gripping conclusion.Lost Horizon is somewhat dated in its attitudes ,and some of its acting styles, but the essential themes and characters of Hilton's novel are perfectly captured and retain their strange and mystical appeal for movie viewers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Ronald Colman finds "Lost Horizon," the 1937 film beautifully and masterfully directed by Frank Capra and also starring Jane Wyman, John Howard, Edward Everett Horton, Thomas Mitchell, Margo, H.B. Warner, Isabell Jewell, and Sam Jaffe.Growing up I have two vivid memories - one is the horrific musical version of this film (remember "The World is a Circle"?) - which I saw in a theater, God help me. The other is a takeoff of the original film on the Danny Kaye Show where Kaye, as Colman, kept saying in an arch British voice: "But I must get back to civilization." Based on James Hilton's famous novel, Ronald Colman plays Robert Conway, most probably modeled on D.H. Lawrence. Conway is a diplomat who has just helped people escape via plane from a violent situation in China. The group includes a consumptive woman (Jewell), Conway and his brother (Howard), a mysterious man (Mitchell) and a teacher (Horton). While traveling, they realize the plane has been hijacked. It finally crash lands in the treacherous, snowy mountains, and the party is picked up and brought to Shangri-la, a magnificent paradise bordered by mountains, somewhere around Tibet, where the air is perfect, the people live by a rule of kindness, age very slowly, and want for nothing. It's kind of like communism but without the oppression and with heavy emphasis on metaphysics. The travelers are met and hosted by Chang (H.B. Warner), and Conway gets an opportunity to meet the founder of Shangri-la some 200+ years ago, the High Lama (Sam Jaffe). He knows by then that it was no mistake that he was brought to Shangri-la, but he wonders why. Knowing that the world is growing more insane by the minute, the High Lama wishes to have all the great knowledge and beauty protected in his paradise and wants Conway to be his successor. Conway later learns that a lovely resident of Shangri-la (Wyman) had read his books and requested that he be brought there.His brother George is anxious to leave and falls in love with a young woman, Maria, (Margo) who is equally desperate to get out. She makes Conway doubt what the High Lama and Chang have told him, so Conway agrees to accompany George and Maria and forsake Shangri-la.This is a fascinating film, absolutely enormous in scope, that has been restored to 132 minutes with some difficulty. Seven more minutes of the soundtrack remain than there is of film, so occasionally one is treated to a frozen screen or stills. There are many thrilling scenes: the opening of the movie, the refueling scene, the walk to Shangri-la, and the trek away from Shangri-la just to mention a few - as well as scenes of great beauty and poignancy, particularly the scene when a heartbroken Conway leaves the paradise on an evening when the citizens, carrying candles, have a procession (this might be part of the High Lama's funeral, which was cut from the film). The music crescendos, and outside the branches that signify the entrance to Shangri-la, the wind whips the snow into a frenzy. Conway turns and takes in the beauty one last time. A gorgeous moment.Ronald Colman is wonderful as Conway, a man who finds the peace and love in Shangri-la that he has searched for his entire life. Sam Jaffe, though the producer insisted he be replaced, is very good as the fragile High Lama, and H.B. Warner brings suitable gentleness to Chan. Isabel Jewell's major moments are in the airplane at the beginning of the film, and by today's standards, she's a bit over the top. Horton and Mitchell provide their usual solid and sometimes amusing support. Jane Wyman, who died only recently at 96, is lovely as Sondra. Howard, best remembered as Katharine Hepburn's fiancée George in "The Philadelphia Story" is appropriately bombastic; and Margo, who would marry Eddie Albert and have a daughter named daughter Maria, is effective in her role as an unhappy citizen. The question remains - why was she so anxious to leave Shangri-la? And what was with George anyway, that unlike the others, he could not embrace the peace and happiness of the place? We are never told. Perhaps in Capra's original, long disastrous version, we get more of an idea.70 years later, "Lost Horizon" is a sad reminder that a) they don't make movies like this anymore; b) the world hasn't changed much and is still in the sorry state it was in 1937; and c) there isn't any lost horizon - because we never found one.</fullReview>

Warner as Chang, sorta John Carradine-ish to me. I enjoy seeing him in these old movies, played 'inscrutable' very well.As for the themes or dated F/X or whatever-who cares? They captured the ideal of an Eden on earth rather nicely, I think considering where and when this was made--they realized the Tibet mileu as best as you could have asked for.**** outta ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A film that still resonates, enhanced by a great actor and haunting premise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've read the other reviews, you won't need a plot summary.I'm a big fan of James Hilton but postponed reading this book or seeing the movie until I felt I was old enough to appreciate it. I found it again in my 40's because of Ronald Colman. In the context of his films, this has to be in the top five. As his daughter said, he felt this role reflected his own personal philosophy and I think this shows in his "performance." It is now one of my personal favorites - great acting (Ronnie's), visually stunning location shots (even if some were sets inside a giant ice house), and a valley you hope spy satellites never find from outer space. Ronald Colman was, and is, one of the great Hollywood actors. It is no coincidence that he played some of the best noble, self-sacrificing character roles of the classic movie era. I guess it was satisfying to have Ronnie finally end up with the girl, rather than the original Hilton ending where he vanishes into the Himalayas, his fate unknown. I guess audiences at the time did not think a man motivated by a desire to live out his life according to a noble philosophy has enough incentive to conquer vast mountain ranges.The other impressive performance is Sam Jaffe's portrayal of the 200 year-old high lama. Which goes to show how superb acting combined with strategic lighting and understated makeup makes you believe he really has lived all those years. The rest of the cast is mostly stock 1930's characters - most added to meet audience tastes at the time: the fallen woman who's dieing, the swindler, the meek "everyman" and the insecure younger brother who basks in reflected glory. I'm also going to ignore the horrible typecasting of the simple native villagers versus the more enlightened outsider (read westerners) who are the monks. I think the village scenes were needed for the comic relief rather than forwarding the central conflict - Conway finally finding his place in the world against his sense of responsibility to his brother.The story, the movie and the characters on the plane still resonate, even after 70 years. What really struck me is how much the beginning of the 21st century seems to be the reflected in the world surrounding the story. Can a leader like Robert Conway exist today? Is Shangri La still safe guarding the treasures of mankind? One can only hope. In the mean time, I'll take this movie out every couple of years to refresh my rose colored glasses and remind myself to "be kind."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watch the DVD reissue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen Lost Horizon a number of times on TV over the years. It seemed that sometimes it was much better than others, though I thought it was my imagination. From watching the DVD, which restored a great many chopped out parts, it is apparent that a variety of editors did a hatchet job on the movie over the years. That is why some versions did not seem to do the book justice - parts where missing from the film.The restored version shows that Capra did a sincere job of trying to stay faithful to the book. However, the book is so much fun that it is still worth reading.One of the best parts of the movie is the lovely Jane Wyatt! Especially in the swimming scene!!! She gives Hedy Lamarr a run for the money! It was a very daring scene for Wyatt to play at the time, and she deserves credit for it. Besides, she is quite beautiful and charming throughout the movie.Anyone who has not seen the movie or read the book, must. It is part of cultural literacy. A bit of trivia: FDR, when asked where Doolittle's planes came from that bombed Tokyo in WWII, answered, "Our base in Shangri La."There is one detail that irked me, and was an odd error on Capra's part. So these folks are being hijacked in an airplane flying across Asia, and they keep asking where are they????? Yet there is a mounted map on the wall at the front of the cabin that apparently covers China and much of Asia. This is plainly visible in the DVD version.This raises the question of why the map was there. The effects in the movie are quite good of the plane flying, etc. It looks like they got their hands on an actual plane in or from China and had to return it, so they didn't remove the map. This, of course, does not make sense, from the Hollywood perspective. You build a set. You can't film within a plane. But it sure looks like they did. It would be interesting to know more about how they actually filmed it, if anyone knows.But as I watch it, I keep wishing one of the characters would say, hey, we've been flying for 20 hours at 300 mph in a northwesterly direction, so according to the map we should be over Nepal, headed for Tibet. Or something.Is this a spoiler? I liked it, anyway.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Finding Shangri-La</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Not being a professional critic, I can only offer my feelings about this movie rather than insights concerning its technical merit. I first saw this rented movie with many distractions from the resident teenagers. But I felt something magical had just unfolded. So I bought it and watched it again a few weeks later. It has become my favorite movie of all time. Maybe it just zeroed in on what appeals to me: drama, action, romance, history and dreams. Author James Hilton delivers more of each than can be put into any one movie and Frank Capra is faithful to the spirit if not the letter. For each one of us, the golden ring is a different hue and Shangri-La offered hope and a place for anyone's needs and talents. The trick, of course, is to find it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A nice place to visit but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Watching this movie again after many years is like taking an acid trip. Capra's film is a total hallucination, suffused with a "make love, not war" philosophy that quickly disappeared with the horrors of Hitler, Mussolini, and Tojo, then returned with a vengeance 30 years later with the hippie culture.Absurdities abound in Shangri-La. Can anyone really believe all that 10-ton furniture was shlepped up those dangerous mountain trails by mysterious "porters?" I guess the point is that greed makes people risk anything for gold. And in a culture in which everyone is equal, why do the wise and educated live in high-rise splendor while the happy laborers toil below? It's like a benign "Metropolis." Or better yet, George Orwell's "Animal Farm," in which some are more equal than others. I couldn't help but wonder how many workers were sweating in the marble quarry while Ronald Colman and Jane Wyatt were frolicking in the forest. Women, of course, are chattel in Shangri-La, as befits the period in which this story was written. That being said, there is still much to admire in this bizarre fantasy. The opening sequence of the revolution in the Chinese town and the ultimate escape by airplane is tremendously exciting. And the sets, art direction, and photography continue to captivate. I was amazed by the avalanche toward the end of the film, an awe-inspiring effect superior to most of the computer-generated images seen in movies today. And Sam Jaffee steals the show with his perfect portrayal of the High Lama.I understand the yearning of some people for a place like Shangri-La. For me, however, it's a nice place to visit but I wouldn't want to live there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Whatever happened to the pilot?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>TLH is the kind of preposterously over-idealistic movie that could only have been pulled off with a degree of success by Capra, and in the 30s or 40s. The naive, wishful-thinking-like musings about human nature seem to come out of the mouths of young children, not adults, but that's perhaps part of the charm. When one of the Shangri-La-ists says that "all those evil men in the outside world would perhaps not be evil in Shangri-La, where they have would have everything", it's hard not to frown a bit. Watching this movie as a kid, I loved it; I saw no flaws. However, about 20 years later, I found myself being slightly embarrassed by some of the nonsense that is being said and implied. I guess this is more of a kids' picture. You need to be very wide-eyed and clueless to overlook the glaring problems with the movie's philosophy.The basic premise is excellent: a Utopia in a far-flung corner of the world. The fact that they chose Tibet was a bit cheesy though, especially with the phony "magical" aura that surrounds this region what with the Dalai Lama, Buddhism and its spirituality, and the rest. The irony is that Tibet, before it was conquered by the communists, was anything but "a paradise with happy people". It was ruled with no less tyranny than by those who overtook it. It would have added to the sense of mystery if the location of Shangri-La was never mentioned, or if they had made up a name for it.The black-&amp;-white photography is very 30s, i.e. has that old-movie feel, showing its full effect in the areal scenes and mountain footage, although I wished certain scenes were shown in colour. As for the flow of the story, there are major discrepancies in quality: the first half hour and the last 15 minutes are superior to anything that happens in-between. Maybe it's not a coincidence at all that this middle part is set in Shangri-La. Perhaps the dullness for the viewer comes from the fact that a "perfect world" would itself be dull in some ways. This long middle part is full of old-school romantic drivel and other irrelevant or uninteresting scenes.As for characterizations, there are clichés Capra could have done without. Chang is played by a white actor, which is simply laughable. Conway's brother is less than one-dimensional: he is CONSTANTLY bitching and throwing temper-tantrums, like a little girl. His character is on the verge of a heart-attack, carrying on all the time like a lunatic. So extreme is this portrayal that Conway's brother almost comes off as unintentionally funny.There were odd details I couldn't quite understand. The Chinese porters shooting at the trio they're leading out of Tibet, for example. Why would they do that? Was that Capra's unsubtle hence ridiculous way of saying how corrupt and evil everyone outside Shangri-La is? Plus, it defies logic that these experienced porters would not know that shooting so much - for absolutely no reason! - might cause an avalanche or two. Capra seems to be saying that Tibetan porters are not only immoral but extremely stupid.However, the most odd detail was the demise of the pilot of the plane. Early in the film, a Chinese man overtakes the cockpit of Conway's flight. We never see this English pilot again, hence I must assume that he was killed. Killed - a victim of Shangri-La's plot to kidnap Conway. Is that how pacifism works? Murder and kidnapping?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful, scary, lovely</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a lovely movie that leaves a wonderful afterglow. It has romance, fantasy, philosophy, adventure. It moved me very much. I also happen to be a fan of Ronald Colman and not to have seen this masterpiece would be a significant omission. It truly is a masterpiece. As I watched it just after watching the State of the Union address, it caused me to think how little has changed in the world regarding war and fears of war when the movie was made. And I think it's important to remember when the movie was made - as Japan strode through Manchuria and China, Germany completely occupied Czechoslovakia that year, having already completed the Anschluss with Austria and bellowing about the "mistreatment" of the Germans of Danzig. The world was a VERY scary place in 1938 - and this book and movie must have evoked a powerful longing for a more tranquil globe.**** SPOILERS **** I've a few criticisms - they do NOT spoil one's real wonder at the movie.Someone mentioned that they didn't really show the arc of the female consumptive - true. It seems like a complete oversight on someone's part - she's almost wholly dropped from the movie. I'm also the last person generally complaining of political incorrectness, but it does strike one to see that: a) the initial rescue was only of whites and the Chinese are left to fend for themselves (however this is mentioned later to the movie's credit),b) the ruler is a Belgian and the non-manual labor seems to be done by the few non-Asians, c) the collection of the treasures of the world all seem to be western,d) the example given by Colman's character of disputes that arise in the outside world is "well, what do you do when there is a fight over women?" to which the answer is an astonishing "no, if another man wants her enough, it would be bad manners not to give her to him". "Give her to him?"!!!e) the Russian girl is supposed to have been 3 years old in 1888 when she was brought there - so if she were living in the outside world, she'd now be 53 - everyone keeps saying she'd be "an old woman in the outside world" - indeed the younger brother is so horrified "LOOK AT HER FACE!" when she assumes her 53 year old age - that he falls off a cliff! Yet Colman was 47 when making this movie - and falling for a 27 year old Jane Wyatt! So he's a LOT closer in age to the "OLD WOMAN" ("My GOD! JUST LOOK AT HER FACE! She's why, she's, oh this can't be true, oh the humanity ... she's FIFTY-THREE YEARS OLD!!") than to his beloved Wyatt. *** SPOILERS END **** Do see it- it's extraordinary. I felt freezing during much of it! And if you like Jane Wyatt (any other Father Knows Best fans?), this is her best movie role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Nice Place to Visit...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shangri La is a nice place to visit but would you really want to live there? You get to live for a long time but Ronald Coleman puts the matter concisely when he says that if life has no point than prolonging it is senseless. The High Lama tells him the point is to preserve culture and provide the world with an example of how to live peaceably and in happiness. However the world described in those books would surely get to seem a lot more interesting than Shangri La after a while. Also, the Heisenberg dilemma, (which holds that you change things by examining them such that when you finish they are no longer what you saw), applies here. If everyone came to Shangri La, their presence would change the place so much it would no longer be Shangri La. No, this place is more of a personal dreamland, not an example to the world.  And how much would you really want to live there? Apparently your choices would be either intellectual pursuits, (reading books, minor craftwork), or farm chores, like shearing sheep or milking cows. If you got bored with that you could chase Jane Wyatt into the forest and maybe she'll let you watch her skinny-dip. That's certainly a surprising scene- even though it's a long shot and presumably a body double. Not only do we associate Ms. Wyatt with the squeaky clean "Father Knows Best" but this is after the production code went into effect, (1934). We've all seen by now Maureen O'Sullivan in "Tarzan and His Mate" and Delores Del Rio in "Bird of Paradise", (both body doubles), or Hedy Lamar in "Ecstasy" (not) but they were before the Production Code. And this long shot is full-frontal, (possible body suit). One wonders if this is from a "European Version". I've always wondered why distributors think there should be different films for different continents. I've also always wonder who might have wound up skinny dipping for Mr. Camera had there been no production code. there would surely have been more surprises.  Anyway, Shangri La seems a much better vacation spot than a place to spend a couple hundred years. And a man like Conway, no matter how much he needed peace and contentment, would hardly be satisfied to spend the rest of his life there. It's peculiarly European to think that Asian peoples could never have founded the colony on their own, such that leader of a Himalayan civilization must be a Belgian. Also the European types live in an Art Deco palace high above the natives, who apparently are unable to appreciate great works of art and literature stored there. Mitchell wants to build a modern plumbing system and Horton wants to teach geology, so apparently there was nothing those books about that. And it's interesting that the place is not so perfect that aren't at least partially dependent on outside help in the form of some not very reliable native porters and a gun wielding Asian airplane pilot.  There are two things about the film I like. The ending- Conway reluctantly leaving the place that now seems to need him and contains the woman he's fallen in love with. The tragic misadventures in the snow country. The story of Conway escaping from "civilization" to seek out Shangri La on his own and incredibly making it. The other thing is one of the greatest musical scores by the very best composer the movies ever had- Dimitri Tiomkin, who later did "High Noon", "Giant", "Friendly Persuasion", "The Alamo" and "The Guns of Navarone". I have a record in which Tiomkin's music is turned into a fine symphonic suite. The main theme, played over the ceremonies after the death of the High Lama and while Conway leaves, will haunt you forever. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>LOST HORIZON is a fantasy adventure directed by Frank Capra. An adaptation, with certain modifications, the novel by British writer James Hilton. My first impression was a little strange. I think this film is a little too much so for Capra, and the studio too. Of course, I am aware of the restoration of the film. The story is not bad, but it's pretty quiet. Simply, in the adventure film has to be certain "adrenaline culmination". Photography is excellent. Obviously Capra gave attention almost every detail. Some scenes look impressive. I think that the characters in the film are not fully defined. Designed dialogue missing. Acting is kind of wooden at times. The chemistry between the actors is also not very high.Colman as R. Conway from the very beginning of the film easily accept things like that is something expected. In this relationship does not make sense. Horton (Lovett), Mitchell (Barnard) and Jewell (Gloria) are the embodiment of a bit confusing changes. Howard (G. Conway) is a rebel who does not want to accept the truth that brings peace and prosperity. I would say that he lacks faith. H.B. Warner (Chang) is moderate philosopher who with his power attracts people. Jaffe (High Lama) is vague and mystical character. I would say some kind of prophet.The movie is a bit boring. Capra in an attempt to create something magnificent. Overall, not too bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Welcome to Shangri-la,.. it's magic."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While watching, I had to wonder what movie viewers of the era must have thought just a couple of decades removed from the first World War while the nations of Europe and Asia seemed potentially headed for a second, eventually to involve the United States as well. Faced with the potential threat of fascist dictators and Imperial designs on the world, the prospect of a magical land of peace and long life must have seemed like the answer to one's prayers. But of course, one could reasonably lament during any period of the planet's history - "Look at the world today. Is there anything more pitiful"? There were some interesting concepts explored in the movie that for it's time, almost eighty years ago, seem like they're just being discovered today. There's High Lama Chang's (H.B Warner) declaration that age is a limit we impose on ourselves, and a modest understanding that one requires little to eat in order to live a long life. That latter idea is beginning to gain some resonance with modern longevity experts who have found that lowering one's caloric intake can actively promote one's health and well being.On the flip side however, I found Chang's attitude toward the treatment of women rather dismal and embarrassing, with Robert Conway's (Ronald Colman) apparent willingness to accept it somewhat troubling. Acquiescing to a rival's desire to be with one's woman/wife was made to sound noble during their discussion, but didn't speak very highly to the principles of loyalty or integrity. I'm actually surprised the subject was broached in the manner it was.The version of the film I viewed on Turner Classics at one hundred thirty two minutes was as complete as possible, a restored print version dating back to 1973 that fell seven minutes short of it's existing soundtrack. The lost footage was replaced by freeze frames and still images that take up the slack for the dialog that ensues, and holds up reasonably well for the story's continuity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lost Horizon (1937): Dir: Frank Capra / Cast: Ronald Coleman, John Howard, Edward Everett Horton, Thomas Mitchell, Jane Wyatt: Gripping adventure about what the imagination fails to grasp. After their plane is highjacked it crash lands in the Himalayas and the passengers are secured in a remote place called Shangri-La where everything seems perfect. Director Frank Capra captures our wonderment but the conclusion asks whether one should stay or go. Capra previously made such acclaim films as It Happened One Night and Mr. Deeds Goes to Town. Like those films, this one deals with people going into unsuspecting territory. Ronald Coleman takes charge and asks questions. He meets with the High Lama where he gains insight into their lifestyles, plus he falls for a woman who educate the children. John Howard plays his agitated brother who wishes to leave. Edward Everett Horton plays a former professor who sees great prospects for a future there. Thomas Mitchell plays a trader who also wishes to remain since he can start over where he went wrong before. Jane Wyatt plays a teacher whom Coleman meets and is enchanted by. She becomes a major reason for his decision to remain there. While sometimes corny it could reference Heaven although it doesn't prove it during a crucial scene. Otherwise this horizon is worth the view in all its glorious appeal. Score: 8 / 10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Forgotten Masterpiece</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lost Horizon is a fantasy dream of epic proportions, making for an appealing blend of blithesome pleasures and complex symbolism. From one side, it's a beautifully photographed adventure in the same vein of a Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger collaboration, but on the other, it has the cerebral heaviness of a playful Metropolis.Directed by Frank Capra, master of the feel-good masterpiece (It Happened One Night, It's a Wonderful Life), Lost Horizon was the result of a passion project, marred by serious budgeting and running time issues. Originally, the film was nearly six hours in length, with an ardent Capra shooting every scene from an overzealous number of angles. For a scene lasting just four minutes, Capra would use over 6,000 feet of film, the amount normally used for an hour's worth of photography. The budget swelled to almost $3 million, thanks to the extensive use of exterior shots and the hazardous dilemmas caused by the snowy sets. I could go on, but a happy ending is in store, and, if you're more curious than you'd like to admit, Wikipedia is readily available.Ultimately, Capra, along with Columbia boss Harry Cohn cuts hours upon hours of footage, much of it lost over the years. The film was restored in 1999 and again in 2013, inserting still pictures in certain scenes to fill in gaps left by regrettable cuts. Presently, Lost Horizon is a woozy combination of crisp repairs, slightly murky discoveries, and awkwardly placed pictures. In many cases, impartiality can be highly destructive. Lost Horizon is one of the lucky ones. It's so self- assured in nearly every other category that the cruelty it was once thrust into in the editing room is completely forgivable. Capra despaired over the film until the day he died, but it's hard to believe that a movie as stimulating and as effortlessly paced as this one could have been marked by even the slightest of a difficulty. It's a forgotten classic.Adapted from James Hilton's 1933 novel of the same name, the film focuses on five refugees who escape a violent revolution in China. After a long night of flying, Alexander Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), the stuffy intellectual of the group, looks out the window as is astonished by what he sees ? it appears that they are traveling in the completely opposite direction of their destination. They have been kidnapped. The plane eventually crashes in an undiscovered zone in the Himalayas, killing the pilot. The group is quickly discovered by a Chinese caravan, who then leads them to an oasis within the mountain range, known as Shangri-La. Shangri-La is ethereal, to say the least. It's an entrance to an entirely new world, where the skies are always sunny, the flowers are always in bloom, the people are always good-hearted, and aging isn't a consideration. The leader of the group, Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) is instantly smitten ? but will he, along with his fellow travelers, last in this too-good-to-be-true idyllic land?Films in the 1930s were almost strictly uplifting, dressed to the nines in screwball comedies, musicals, and set designs that suggested that poverty didn't exist and even the nobodies could afford butlers and caviar. Turn to any Rogers &amp; Astaire pairing, any Ernst Lubitsch romp ? that was 90% of what audiences were used to. Everyone wanted a break from The Great Depression, after all.Lost Horizon retains the uplifting persona of the era, but avoids all the first class garbage that felt delicious at first but eventually left a bad taste in your mouth. It is, first and foremost, an adventure film, making you feel like a child again at every turn. Shangri-La is a bewitching world that makes the fantasy genre seem delightful all over again, and the fact that it lies somewhere deep in the Himalayas makes it all the more special, all the more untouchably engaging. It is heaven for people who have goodness in their hearts, but it's a hell for those who are too self-serving and sinful. But forget all the heaven and hell comparisons ? Lost Horizon is escapism of the highest common denominator. You'll want to be swept away, not sit there with analytical expectations.Much of the film's success is largely due to Capra, who, despite the setbacks he faced while filming, makes a movie so easy to devour that you can't help but want to have more. He's always been able to piece together a popcorn film with brains, but Lost Horizon is certainly his most ambitious moment. Though his own unrealistic goals pushed film's budget to places it couldn't afford, the result is something of a wonder. The sets are absolutely stunning, combing Asian decor with art deco modernness, and the photography, however indulgent it may be, is lively and plenty dreamy, the black-and-white giving it an innocent, fantastical ambiance. Lost Horizon could have been damaged goods, but it overcomes those damages and becomes goods for the ages. Capra may have sweat a bullet or two, but one can hardly remember It's a Wonderful Life when swept up into the luster of Lost Horizon.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We weren't meant for paradise."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sayeth Captain James T. Kirk, commanding officer of the U.S.S. Enterprise.Why did I quote a science fiction captain of a TV show totally unrelated to a film from 1937? Because "Lost Horizon" deals with finding heaven on Earth, and dispensing with a lot of the egotistical walls we erect for ourselves to protect our pride."Lost Horizon" is, in essence, a story about individuals who are frustrated by the conventions of society to the breaking point as Communist Chinese forces sweep across China, setting everything alight. The main characters escape, or so they think, only to begin another adventure.This film examines the character and behavioral pitfalls that can get exaggerated and ruin our personality if we don't deal with them in some shape or form. The characters in "Lost Horizon" are the epitome of what we might call our flaws, or traits of mankind. The legendary "Shangri La" is a place where those frustrations can be dealt with in one form or another. But does paradise come with freedom? At what cost do all your dreams come? Maybe it's time to watch Captain Kirk in "This Side of Paradise"."Lost Horizon" is actually a ground breaking film in a philosophical approach to addressing frustrations of mankind. Ah, but not in the social vein that the casual reader of my review might think. For that you'll have to live some more.Well shot, this black and white film shows how medium master shots can carry the day for a film. Technically it's a very good film with few flubs. It is dated, but I think stands the test of time.I'm not a huge fan of the film, though I understand it far much better than I did as a boy when I used to see it as a kid on TV. At the time I dismissed it as a simple adventure story. Looking at it with adult eyes, I see it with a far more worldly mindset, and now understand why the film was given praises by past generations (although I've yet to make up my mind entire about it).For the younger viewer, it is a slow film. But, if you've had a lot of world experience, then you should have a gander at this film, by try not to understand it all at once and right away. Just accept it for what it is, and enjoy it.A bit slow, full of intrigue and adventure, an interesting bit of escapism that might lead you craving for your own slice of reality and nirvana all at once.In short, Captain Kirk was commenting on living in bliss in a hospital like environment where nothing can hurt you, and all your desires are met. Even though Shatner spoke those words for his character some 30+ years later, it is applicable, because this is what Shangri La, in actuality, is; a hospital.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Journey To Shangri-la</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a masterful film, filled with adventure, memorable characters, and a story that is profoundly thoughtful. During a tumultuous revolt in China, a party of Westerners, including an important British diplomat named Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), escapes by airplane, flying west through the high mountains of Asia. In this no-mans land, disaster strikes. But beyond, a peaceful kingdom called Shangri-la awaits the party, led by their guide, the wise and purposeful Chang (Oscar-nominated H.B. Warner). Much of the plot takes place in this beautiful and serene place.In Shangri-la, doctors are not needed, there is no crime, residents are content and happy. And people age very slowly, as a result of "the absence of struggle". Despite the forbidding mountains and their harsh weather that surround Shangri-la, this isolated paradise contains lush vegetation, useful minerals, a picturesque waterfall, birds and other wildlife.Most characters are appealing. I like the wise and patient Mr. Chang. The High Lama (Sam Jaffe) exudes peace and wisdom. The George character is annoying, but serves a purpose as the representative of conventional humanity. There are many lines of thoughtful dialogue. One of my favorites is a quote from Chang who talks to Conway about aging. Says Chang in a non-judgmental and soft voice: "You know, each time you Westerners celebrate your birthdays, you build another fence around your minds".B&amp;W visuals are grainy. Lighting ranges from evocative to bad. In the outdoor adventure scenes, there are lots of interesting long shots. Sets make use of painted backdrops and miniatures. And the special effects are terrific for the era. Background music is intermittent and ranges from nondescript in early segments to ethereal in Shangra-la. Acting is adequate.Though the film tells a great outdoor adventure story, the real value of "Lost Horizon" lies in its deep spiritual themes, as expressed by Chang and the High Lama. Rarely does a film exude such wisdom. And it is mostly for this reason that, despite imperfect visuals, the film ranks among my all-time favorites.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Favorite movie quote - "There are moments in every man's life when he glimpses the eternal." Welcome to Shangri-La, a Utopian paradise where everyone adheres to one, simple rule - Be kind. (Yep. It sure sounds easy enough, but, hey, it can get mighty tough slugging at times) In spite of its glaring flaws and ludicrous improbabilities, Lost Horizon, in the long run, was, surprisingly enough, quite a thoughtful movie in many ways.Even though it preached of serene happiness, the virtues of avoiding excesses, and the basic principles of Christianity, its earnest message seemed both sincere and genuine.Usually films which include obvious undertones of Christianity as the basis of its story don't go over very well with me. But, I found Lost Horizon to be something of an exception to the rule.With Lost Horizon now being 77 years old, one must make a point of keeping its time-frame firmly in mind in order to get any worthwhile entertainment value out of this vintage production.Unfortunately, this film's 132-minute running time worked against its story being an overall success. Had about a half-hour's worth of this fairy tale been edited out of the final product, then I think that this would have helped things immensely.One of Lost Horizon's most notable performances was that of Ronald Coleman who played the Robert Conway character.This is definitely one of those films that one must experience for themselves in order to make a fair and honest judgement of its content.</fullReview>

Because Ultimately what is Shown Fails, Except on the Most Superficial Level Imaginable. What Amounts to Nothing More than some Interesting Long Process Shots, Modern Architecture, and a Deer Park. There is Hardly Anything Ethereal or Heavenly about it.The Movie Seems to Gain Artistic and Philosophical Reverence in its Journey from the Screen by way of the Eye, to the Brain and it Takes Up Residence in the Subconscious and Conscious Recollection and Reflection are Nothing Like what is Actually Up there being Projected. Because the Film is Extremely Unrealized, Disjointed, and Flat.It takes a High Road to be Sure, but the Exalted and Elevated Locale is Rather Bland, Boring, Dull and is Barely Picturesque. Not the Ideas or the Message but how it is Expressed Cinematically. If Director Frank Capra couldn't put together a Better Movie than this from a 6 Hour Initial Cut, there's Trouble in Motion Picture Paradise.It is Heady and at Times Inspirational, Moving and Interesting in a Few Spots but Overall this is Overrated and Over Praised, and that is Probably More of and Insight into the Hopes and Dreams of the Audience than the Excellence of the Film. With its Mega-Budget Seemingly Wasted because so Much More could have been Shown with Only Moderate Financing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Glad Lost Horizon is not lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of my favorite stories, enhanced by the always charming Ronald Colman, who often visited the Jack Benny Show with his wife, Benita Hume. Supposedly they were next door neighbors.Parts of "Lost Horizon" were really lost and, in the VCR version stills were substituted.The beautiful tale of a man who found his Shangri La is another triumph for Frank Capra, the man responsible for some of the finest movies ever made.It is a tale of idealism, but shows that idealism is not always ideal. To be truthful, if I had found such a place I would definitely hang around. Nothing, especially in today's world, offers as much comfort and loveliness as Shangri-La. I'd be glad to overlook and/or overcome any problems to be found there."Lost Horizon" is magnificent movie-making, and its message of a world in turmoil is more true today than ever before.P.S. Can y'all offer folks a book about grammar and spelling? Reading one in particular, the word 'atrocious' comes to mind. He obviously ignores your spell-checks, or probably can't understand them.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Great Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra directed "Lost Horizon" the film version of the famous novel written by James Hilton. The movie tells the story of a small group of people who are kidnapped on a flight and end up finding a magnificent, mysterious and peaceful place called Shangri-La, where harmony and peace are the most common thing in the world and where all the people are calm, everlasting, barely aging. Conway (Ronald Colman) leads the group and tries to understand what happens in this new and beautiful place, enjoying long conversations with the high Lama and learning valuable life lessons. Here we have lost characters who discover a life purpose in a so-called Lost Horizon, contrary to the place where they came from, in the agitated city life, running away from wars, conflicts and pain. Perhaps the most daring aspect of the film is not follow the book in its totality. But I'm not saying that the movie is not faithful to the written work, ti's just that is slips away with some good changes. Some characters were added (the one played by Edward Everett Horton), others were converted to the fit the film in a more interesting way (the boring Mallinson in the book was transformed into Ronald Colman's brother in the film). The book, one of the greatest readings I had this year, is great in its way, and the movie is also great in its way, both complete each other very well. The only thing that bothered me a little was the kidnap (this was present in the book). Not much of the act itself but it was something that occurred during the kidnap when the oriental kidnapper killed the pilot and control the plane. I can't remember what really happened in the book but all I know is that this was very equivocal to the story if one consider that the people of Shangri-La were non violent persons. So how can one accept peaceful people killing another person because they need to "select" persons to be part of the harmless and magical Shangri-La? This was something that could be revised back in the 1937. But this doesn't make the film less interesting, after all there's a great message to deliver about love, peace, friendship amongst people.I loved Shangri-La! Incredible sets, scenery, mountains, a very peaceful place, well constructed. A very positive and philosophical film made by Frank Capra, less corny than some of his other films. Colman was perfect as Conway, the only member of the crew who enjoys this new place from the first day he stepped in there. "Lost Horizon" was restored in 1973 (coincidentally on the same year when the awful musical version was released) and some parts of the film, I mean, some of the images were lost, never found, or they were so deteriorated by the time that still photographs of the actors were used as replacement, with the soundtrack/sound playing naturally. But it's still watchable and it's a very good film. Although I've complained about the musical remake and people are not very fond of remakes these days I think that this story needs a bigger audience and the only way to get it is by making another film, but it's got to be similar than Capra's version and more appealing to a world audience.This is a perfect movie for a Sunday afternoon or calm days. Despite some twisted and darker things close to the ending it's a great film that never disappoints the viewer. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>World-weary diplomat Ronald Coleman had trouble finding his way back to paradise in 1937, and modern moviegoers returning to Frank Capra's Shangri-La might find the journey no less challenging. The film today demands a forgiving viewer to look beyond the stale characters, dated acting style, and saccharin optimism, and see the James Hilton story as a product of its age. With the Great Depression still in full swing and a global war only a few short years away, what better time for a comforting wish-fulfillment fantasy about a remote land of peace and plenty, where everyone lives content and no one grows old? The ravages of time may have left their mark, but Hilton's haunting, visionary fable of a heavenly domain hidden deep within the Himalayan mountains endures as a vivid adventure for audiences willing to suspend their prejudice against the dated histrionics and director Frank Capra's typically simpleminded sentiments. The strengths of the film are still largely those of the book: a compelling scenario, a fantastic setting, and an air of almost heartbreaking dreamlike wonder. The choppy narrative may or may not be the result of a painstaking restoration job, which substitutes production stills over recovered snatches of isolated soundtrack. But be assured there's potent magic still left in the Valley of the Blue Moon, and even today the High Lama's plea for global kindness sounds not unlike a warning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am always up for seeing the work of director Frank Capra (The Bitter Tea of General Yen, Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It's a Wonderful Life), and I think I remember seeing this film once. Basically British diplomat and future Foreign Secretary Robert Conway (Ronald Colman), who does not believe in fighting, escapes China with his brother George (John Howard), geologist Alexander P. Lovett (Edward Everett Horton), rogue trader Henry Barnard (Thomas Mitchell), and sick and bitter Gloria Stone (Isabel Jewell), during the rebellion. Unfortunateky the plane is taken in mid-flight, and it crashes in the middle of Tibet somewhere, eventually being rescued by the local residents. They are taken to a a peaceful and plentiful Utopian paradise, Shangri-La, without illness, war and apparently ageing. They start off thinking they are kidnapped prisoners, but as time passes each survivor start to love their surroundings, except George who is still adamant to leave. Also starring Jane Wyatt as Sondra, Margo as Maria, Oscar nominated H.B. Warner as Chang and Bedknobs and Broomsticks' Sam Jaffe as High Lama. I remember very small amounts of the plane being taken over, Robert finding living on the island and falling for Gloria heavenly and the brother sure they are being held captive, but apart from that not much. The critics rate it very highly, five out of five, I'm sure I would agree if I pay really good attention (and don't doze off) I will agree, it is certainly a likable looking fantasy adventure. It won for Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing, and it was nominated for Best Picture, Best Assistant Director for Charles C. Coleman, Best Music for Morris Stoloff and Dimitri Tiomkin and Best Sound. It was number 64 on The Ultimate Film. Very good!</fullReview>

It was nominated for seven Oscars, Assistant director, Music Score, Sound and Supporting Actor (H.B. Warner), and won two, Art Direction and Editing. It certainly deserved the art direction win, the sets are magnificent and among the best from the 1930's. Lavishly produced, well done special effects and great cinematography.The cast does a great job. Ronald Colman is ideal in the lead, Edward Everett Horton, Thomas Mitchell, Sam Jaffe and H.B. Warner all provide fine performances. The film is haunting, exciting and poignant and has numerous unforgettable scenes. There are a few slow patches, but the film's grandeur makes up for that.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the future British Foreign Secretary is sent to war torn China to rescue a group of British subjects, he ends up on the last plane with his brother George, the ailing Sondra and two other men, "Lovey" and "Barney". But the plane gets skyjacked and crashes in the mountains, where the group is rescued and taken in by the mysterious inhabitants of Shangri-La, an isolated mountain paradise. The group then has to decide whether to remain in this community or to seek their way back through the treacherous mountains back to "civilization".Capra's "Lost Horizon" is a wonderful adventure and fantasy story that is successful in evoking the longing that one feels for a perfect world. It has excellent acting by all performers with decent, if somewhat stylized character development that shows different facets of humanity. It is interesting to watch the change in each character as the film progresses. There is sufficient humor to raise a few smiles and yet the film maintains a fairly serious tone throughout.The story is simple and yet it moves along at a brisk pace without getting tedious. And the ending fits just perfectly into the whole storyline.The sets in Shangri-La look somewhat too modern and out of place for the Tibetan mountains, but may just help emphasize the other-worldliness fantasy aspect of the film.This is a must see film for those who are fans of fantasy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra adapts James Hilton's Utopian novel with grace and beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's so nice to be able to see something resembling the original vision Capra had for this story, the wonders of science gives us a cracking restoration to enjoy at our want.Robert Conway is a British diplomat who helps a group of people (one his younger brother) escape from a Chinese revolution in a passenger plane, all doesn't go to plan, tho, as the plane has been skyjacked and is heading into the Himalayas, and Tibet. The plane crash lands due to the pilot becoming stricken, and after the passengers get out they are greeted by a party of people belonging to the Valley Of The Blue Moon, to which is a beautiful and peaceful world known as Shangri-La.Shangri-La is gorgeous, there is no illness there, no war or hostility, the landscape is paradise on earth, people live far longer than is deemed possible in the outside world, it is utopia in everyone's wildest dreams. Here Conway and the group, after initial scepticism, come to love the place and have no desire to leave this haven that is shut off from the outside world. That is, all except the younger Conway (George), and as is always the case in large social communities, cracks begin to emerge and questions remain unanswered.The film has a wonderful dreamy quality about it, it's filmed firmly with romantic fantasy intention, and it's the quality of the production that really helps to emphasise this intriguing story. The sets are gorgeous, the music is perfectly on tempo throughout, and the acting is top notch, while the love Capra had for the topic is evident in every frame. Thankfully all of the great work on the film has the story to match, and it's the story, and it's turn of events in the last third, that is ultimately the film's crowning glory. Magical. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great romantic fantasy from Capra</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When this film debuted in theaters in March of 1937 it had a run time of 138 minutes. By the time it made it to television late night movie showings in the 50's and 60's it was down to 95 minutes. It's now restored to near it's original run-time but some of the original film has been lost and the use of stills and other techniques needed to be used in it's restoration. This film was adapted by Robert Risken from the best selling 1933 novel by James Hilton. The novel was so popular that Franklin Roosevelt named his Maryland presidential retreat Shangri-La which has since been re-named as Camp David. By the time this film was released four years after the novels publication the word Shangri-La had become a catch phrase almost replacing the word utopia. A planeload of diplomats and missionaries on a flight from Baskul, India to Shanghai is hijacked and crash lands in a remote mountainous region of Tibet. The survivors are rescued by a group of devotees to a Lama that has built a monastery in a hidden mystical valley called Shangri-La. There is beautiful paradise on earth where people never age and live in isolation and happiness. To capitalize on the success of the book and film Zhongdian, China renamed itself Shangri-La to imply that it was the inspiration for the story although it wasn't. Novelist Hilton also wrote Goodbye Mr. Chips and So Well Remembered which became films and he turned to screen writing writing Camille and winning an Academy Award for Mrs. Miniver. This film is from legendary director Frank Capra who in the first decade of talking pictures had already made the classic films Mr. Deeds Goes to Town, It Happened One Night, The Bitter Tea of General Yen and Platinum Blonde. Joseph Walker who photographed much of Capra's films is the cinematographer. Film composer Dimitri Tiomkin provides the score. This film won two Academy Awards for Best Art Direction and Best Film Editing and was nominated for Best Picture, Best sound, Best Supporting Actor for H.B. Warner, Best Score and in the last time the Academy had a category for Best Assistant Director, Charles C. Coleman received a nomination. Besides Warner the cast includes Ronald Coleman, Jane Wyatt, Edward Everette Horton, John Howard, Isabel Jewell, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffee. I would give this a 9.0 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have only seen this film on a remastered DVD which contains restored footage by Robert Gitt, in some ways this detracted from the film for me as there are times when you hear the audio track but with the lack of film only get to see still photographs.The acting is fine, though typical of the 1930's, the message comes across well in a story that holds a great deal of interest. Some of the sets are amazing especially that of Shangri-La. I enjoyed the conflict shown between those in the group happy to embrace the new life and those hankering after what they left behind. The idea of a place where time stands still and all conflict and can be resolved and life lived in peace and harmony is a powerful concept and one which consistently appeals to the human race. It is captured in this film, even if it is a little over dramatic at times, but hell it was nearly 70 years ago so they can be forgiven for that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Frank Capra Gets Lost in the Horizon</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As World War II simmers, heroic British writer Ronald Colman (as Robert "Bob" Conway) rescues himself and four others from certain death during a Chinese uprising. Mr. Colman, cynical brother John Howard (as George Conway), prissy paleontologist Edward Everett Horton (as Alexander P. Lovett), fugitive businessman Thomas Mitchell (as Henry Barnard), and coughing floozy Isabel Jewell (as Gloria Stone) think they are bound for Shanghai and London. But, their plane is hijacked? They land "where civilization ends" in the Himalayas near Tibet, and are taken to a pretty area called "Shangri-La", which is governed by serene English-speaking H.B. Warner (as Chang). The place turns out to be a Utopian paradise. Colman meets pretty skinny-dipping Jane Wyatt (as Sondra Bizet) and learns some of the valley's secrets, primarily from wise old Sam Jaffe (as the "High Lama"). Supposedly, area residents never grow old ? as long as they don't leave Shangri-la...The castaways eventually begin to enjoy life in the idyllic village ? well, all except Coleman's skeptical brother. Mr. Howard never adapts to, or accepts his new surroundings. He is determined to return to civilization with brother Coleman and attractive young Margo (as Maria), who claims she is being held prisoner. Their particular struggle emerges as the film's most intriguing conflict. The "Maria" character is lacking, but Howard's defining speech is part of a great restoration.This version of James Hilton's popular novel is of an entirely different tone than the book, which may be unintentional (but it certainly makes you think). In this "Lost Horizon" your focus is (arguably) directed toward Howard's questioning character; he becomes a non-conformist anti-hero. In the end, whatever they attempted was unsuccessful - yet, Capra's "Lost Horizon" retains some definite allure. Too bad the third act fails, and the "Shangri-la" scenes weren't filmed in color.******* Lost Horizon (3/2/37) Frank Capra ~ Ronald Colman, John Howard, Jane Wyatt, Edward Everett Horton</fullReview>

Yes maybe the acting style is dated in parts but it is one of those classic 30's films where it does not matter and I don't believe it could successfully be re-made.I particularly enjoy the music by Dimitri Tiomkin ( the candlelight procession).The close up of Colman's face as he looks back to Shangrilla when he leaves is one of cinemas great moments. The message at the end of the film indicating that we are all looking for our own "Shangrilla" is probably more relevant today than when the film was made.It is a shame that young people today do not bother to watch these films.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The trappings of any society force man to dream of a place where there is no word for suffering and everyone finds true love. Unfortunately, we have no such place on Earth-so we dream about it. `Lost Horizon' capitalizes on our thirst for paradise with a euphoric romp through Tibet.Fittingly enough, the film introduces us to the protagonists in the midst of a conflict-possibly seeming from Japanese aggression of China at the time. They pile into a plane and narrowly escape the oncoming fighting. However, a Mongolian with different set of priorities hijacks the plane only to crash it in China's frigid mountainous region. If they hadn't enough problems, a group of strange natives surround the plane. However, they find that the natives speak English, much to the relief of the passengers. The natives lead them to a paradise hidden by the murderous climate: Shangri-la-just one of the mythical cities sought by man's unquenchable thirst for paradise.However, the peacefulness and scenery impress none of the passengers. In fact, the lack of contention only irritates them more. They apply the universal law of man to the situation: you don't get something for nothing. Alas, they wait for some type of catch. But the law of Shangri-la is the supreme Christian ethic of `love thy neighbor' tempered by the human need for moderation.Yet as time passes, they grow accustomed to their stay. The two-feet-on-the-ground dignitary Robert Conway finds himself a new love. Other members of the crew find new occupations in order to express their increasing gratitude to the natives. It's only Conway's brother George that wishes to leave at the end of the movie. By that time, brace yourself for a plot that twists like a Six-Flags rollercoaster.Perhaps the strength of this movie lies in director Frank Capra's lap, recalling other work from films like 1946's `It's a Wonderful Life' and 1933's `Lady for a Day.' His direction, combined with picturesque scenes of the Himalayas and Shangri-la put the audience in the picture. It's clear that no dollar was spared to make this a top-notch film: that's what earned it a nomination for 1937's best picture.Theatrical themes during the Great Depression revolved around escapism. The Depression lasted 8 years by that point and people were looking for a way out. Yet even in a modern context, the theme still resounds: people are always looking for the escape hatch on hectic everyday life. Perhaps the only things dated were the attitudes and paradigms of the westerners by their refreshingly un-politically-correct demeanors.The characters were likeable-if not slightly stereotyped. There was Conway: the upright British fellow with the closely cropped moustache. Then sarcastic American boob whose principal aspiration is to swindle unsuspecting folks. Naturally, throw in the femme-fatale blonde with a crew full of men. You find yourself admiring Chang, the proprietor of Shangri-la, for tolerating the new arrivals' blasé attitudes and sharp criticisms.The hair-in-the-soup is the film's age. Subsequent re-edits chipped away nearly 30 minutes of original footage. In an attempt to restore as much as possible, stills were added to audio tracks to reconstruct the missing scenes. However, these serve more to irritate and distract rather than add plot and character development.If the remaining footage were to be discovered and re-added, the film would be superb. Alas, like everyday life, we can only hope for Earthly utopia, but in the end not expect it in our lifetimes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>early b/w travel epic -- has missing scenes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good (but LONG) movie for its time. A group traveling in distant lands is lost in a far away, remote place "shangri la", when their airplane crashes, and they are introduced to another land and way of living. About two thirds of the way through the movie, there are some missing scenes in the version shown on cable, (what a shame) so stills are substituted. Also the town has its secrets, and its up to the travelers to decide if they are lies or the truth... yes, all is shown to the viewer in the end. There isn't a whole lot of energy between the actors, but I think the writers wanted us to concentrate on the "magical town" and the larger ideas presented... kind of a "What would YOU do in this position?" premise... Ronald Colman and party are introduced to a Utopia, and must decide if they want to stay or try to return home. Also stars Jane Wyatt, Margo and of course, the one and only Edward Everett Horton (starred in all the Fred Astaire movies, and was the narrator for the "fractured fairy tales on "Bullwinkle"!) GREAT photography scenes of the mountains, the deserts, the snow-drifts, and the valley where the "lama-sary" (spelling?) is located. I think the valley was supposed to represent Palm Springs as the secret get-away paradise for all the movie stars from 1930 - 1960, but that is purely conjecture on my part. I'm also convinced that the funeral procession (complete with torches) inspired the similar "soldiers with torches" marching scene in "Wizard of Oz" two years later. Directed by Frank Capra. Good, enjoyable epic story to curl up and watch on a Saturday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>For trpdean, and comments on the restored vs. original version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Good comments, but a correction needed - the Russian girl was 20 years old, not 3 years old, when she was brought to Shangri-La in 1888. Therefore she would have been 70 years old at the time of the film, not 53.Jane Wyatt's character was 3 years old when brought to Shangri-La.General comments - there are two versions of this film, the version originally released to the theaters and a restored version from the early 90's where some key scenes were added. For some of these scenes, only the audio was complete, so to fill in the video, a montage of stills is substituted.I would highly recommend seeing the restored version over the original version. I first saw the film in the original version, and some things made little sense.In the restored version, much is cleared up from these new scenes. First, there is an added scene with the consumptive girl after they first get to Shangri-La, which gives the viewer the first information on the "healing powers" of the place. Second, Conway's first meeting with Father Perrault is extended, giving a much deeper explanation of the good father's vision. Lastly, in the original film, all of a sudden Lovett (Edward Everett Horton) likes Shangri-La and gets along with Barney (Thomas Mitchell), and there is no explanation as to why. The restored scene explains it perfectly.The restored version is a much better, more complete film. Apparently there was quite a bit of cutting of the original as it was deemed by the producers to be too long, and Capra cut some of the meat with the fat.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lost Horizon: a 5/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Even the version of this Frank Capra's film is well restored, I still find it is an unforgivable disappointment, there is a Shangri-La in everyone's mind, clearly mine is much more different than Mr. Capra's.I have not got the chance to read the original novel, judging from the film itself, I could easily consider the latter is unfortunately underperformed. I can accept the set is artificial after all it is a film made 70 years ago, but the annoying fact that the depiction of Shangri-La is sketchy and all the characters are feigned and shallow makes me wonder whether the value orientation has truly changed so much during the 70 years evolution. I am an ardent fan of Capra's work, although the film is 120 minutes long, however what the film intends to inform us is rather limited, I can only posit that maybe all the answers are lying in the novel. This film does arouse my doubt about my appreciation of Hollywood films from that Golden Age (1920-1970), I am for fear that their halos are diminishing as time goes by (for most of them), I highly doubt the new generation would admire these works as much as their precedents. I wish I am just meeting trouble halfway, or I will merely focus myself upon those more contemporary ones which at least I could express my straight afterthoughts without feeling guilty or hardhearted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lost Horizon is the sort of movie that you might enjoy if you just let the inanities of it roll over you. If you don't know the premise by now, Ronald Coleman, plays a would be British foreign affairs secretary who's plane is hijacked by an unknown pilot and crashes in the middle of a mountain range in Asia. He, along with 5 other passengers are rescued by the people of Shangri-La and taken to a paradise palace, in the middle of this mountain range. Again, please don't ask questions of HOW such a thing was built or why no one else could have, you know, found out about it. The leader, Chang, tells that in this land no one grows old and everyone is happy go-lucky. Coleman, and some other passengers, find this paradise to be just wonderful and pledge to live there for the rest of eternity, while others, especially his brother, think the whole thing is creepy and just can't wait to hightail it out the first chance he gets (and who can blame him?) He also wants to take a citizen of Shangri-La, who's been unhappy since she arrived there 200 years ago, and just wants to leave. The thought of just, well, leaving, never occurred to her I guess.Directed somewhat briskly, since there's a lot of ridiculous material to cover here, by Frank Capra, Lost Horizon is a fun film to watch, but hardly one to take seriously.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Capra's Fantasy Still Works After All These Years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Lost Horizon (1937) *** 1/2 (out of 4) Frank Capra's fantasy about a group of people whose plane is hijacked and they're taken to the mysterious Shangri-La. Once there, explorer Robert Conway (Ronald Colman) tries to figure out if it's true that no one here grows old and that everything can be accomplished simply through peace and kindness. At the same time, some of the other people aboard the plane aren't crazy about staying as they find these stories to be fake. LOST HORIZON is yet another classic held very high by film buffs and thank God Frank Capra directed it because in anyone else's hands the film would have been a disaster. Like many Capra movies, this one here preaches about kindness and it preaches about all humans living better if only they were kind to one another. I think we'd all agree that it's a good message but Capra, as usual, really beats the viewer over the head and to my thinking he's the only director able to do such a thing without making you turn the film off. I was really impressed with this movie even though there are some very big flaws that I'll get to in a second. What impressed me most was the atmosphere that the director was able to create because it really does feel as if you're in a far away place that no one knows about. The settings of Shangri-La aren't anything overly special but the nature and care that Capra brings to it really makes the thing stand out. Of course, another major plus is that Colman is giving one of the greatest performances of his career. I think one of the hardest things for any actor to do is to "think" on the screen. This is the type of role that requires the lead character to do a lot of thinking and while the character is taking in everything being fed to him, it really does seem as if Colman is taking it all in, thinking about it and trying to come to some sort of conclusion. I really loved the way Colman played the part and he was certainly the right actor for it. The supporting cast includes a strong performance by Jane Wyatt as well as good turns by Edward Everett Horton, John Howard, Thomas Mitchell and Sam Jaffe. Apparently Harry Cohn wasn't too impressed with the performance of H.B. Warner but I thought he did a very good job in the role of Chang. When one discusses LOST HORIZON they have to discuss its history as Capra originally screened a version that ran over three-hours but after a disastrous screening it was cut to 132-minutes. Over the years Cohn, who always felt it was too long, decided to edit it down several times until it was eventually lost to time. The film was eventually restored and the lost scenes added back but there are still seven minutes worth of audio with no picture. These scenes have photos in their place and while it's certainly distracting at least the audio has survived. Now, the one major flaw with the picture is that it is too long. The film's middle really starts to drag in spots but thankfully it finally picks up for a pretty emotional ending.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Meek Shall Inherit the Earth - Spoilers</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Blessed are the meek...... ....for they shall inherit the earth.I think that the lead character only realized this when he was back in London. He was not pursuing a dream therefore..... but SOMETHING REAL. Some of the comments on this board are unfair therefore: That Shangri La may be spoiled if only too many people come. Or that it is a boring place to live. It is boring only for those who do not understand the true nature of what is corruption and what is reality. The lead character only realized in the very end that he had been told the truth. This had nothing to do with taking responsibility for a place like Shangri La - the moment he understood it, it was pure self interest trying to find the way back. Some people will experience this in life, some won't, and some won't ever care. Those who don't care, like in the movie, may catch a glimpse.... ...but they will never find the way back once they leave.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This magnum opus becomes little more than a magnificent embarrassment by its end. Rumored to be originally cut at 6 hours by its director, and then "trimmed" to 3 hours for it's premier, I understand that the original audience reactions were so vehemently negative back in '37 that it had to be whacked down some more (some prints are as short as 97 minutes) before it could be reasonably endured. The restored print I viewed recently, at 132 minutes, put back enough of the misery that even one of the hard core filmies with me at showing opted to flee instead of throw more good time after bad, and the whole experience made it abundantly clear to me why this film, though it may be important for so many reasons, and impressive for its scope and many of its elements, fails on far too many levels to be revered as so many have been confused into revering here and elsewhere. I'm glad I saw it, but I'd spare anyone else the misery, if they might be considering the film for anything other than as a film history curiosity.The opening sequence is, to be fair, fairly brilliant. The crowd scenes are intense, and the editing is crisp and emotionally powerful. Ronald Coleman's take on the character is likewise fully up to the task, and Capra's deft touch with the action surprises and delights. (Who knew!) But things so quickly head into La La Land (sorry, bad pun) from there, that you almost forget by the end how good it was for those first few minutes.The list of problems with this film is pretty long. John Howard's performance, as younger brother George to Coleman's older brother Bob, is so bad and over the top it takes first prize for me. (So very bad words fail). But there is plenty of competition. Characters appear at such random intervals, and entertain each other with such random dialogue, that it makes you wonder how much possible sense from those original 6 hours of film had to be left on the floor in order to get things down to 2. Margo, as Maria, sports mismatched eyelashes in some of the scenes, which are actually somewhat amusing if you don't mind laughing at a movie you're trying desperately to like. Isabell Jewel gets to show off a few lines of her classic "gun moll" dialogue skills, but she soon becomes almost invisible as her makeup is wiped off and her character is literally written out of the script. The most enjoyable characters and performances are Thomas Mitchell's and Edward Everett Horton's, and they're fun to watch when they appear, but they serve no ultimate dramatic purpose, nor make a whole lot of sense.The main premise, that of the internal and eternal question of the possible existence of something like "Shangri-La" itself, remains unsatisfactory all the way to the end. By the time a gratuitous and completely exposited summary is recited at the gentleman's club to supposedly explain why we've been watching the entire movie, you realize that Capra had so thoroughly lost the thread of things that even he couldn't make sense of it or produce an actual film of his intentions. Film school students do a better job choosing ways to visually portray ideas and emotions. This film ultimately fails.As for my favorite bits, I'll commend once again the opening sequence, and encourage anyone to invest the time to watch at least that much. It's excellent. Ronald Coleman's performance, and Jane Wyatt's with him, are outstanding, and some edited bits of that will please anyone with an appreciation. I also very much enjoyed H.B. Warner's Chang, and even didn't mind Sam Jaffe's High Lama impersonation. Add in Mitchell's and Horton's contributions, and the better part of 2 million 1936 dollars, and you'd think a guy like Capra might be able to make a pretty decent movie. (Fail).The sets are incongruous. The main building in Shangri-La looks like nothing so much as a faux-classy hotel. (Think Vegas circa 1960--maybe they were copying). The airplane interior is great, as are many of the rooms at Shangri-La. But the inconsistency of styles moving back and forth from interiors to exteriors to panoramas, is jarring. (Feels very much like different location directors with vastly different styles had to be cut together without any attempt whatsoever to find a thematic consistency). Too many performances clunk. The story itself is well overlong, and moves so pointlessly that the emotional and existential intent of the story is all but completely obscured. Yes, we get it that we're supposed to think about the possibility of it, but when 10 minutes of film succeeds in communicating the paradox of it, the 2 additional hours belaboring that point make things anything but better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Welcome to Shangri La, the Utopian land high in the Himalayas. Frank Capra's account, of the James Hilton book, was a film that ran longer than what the public wanted to see, even if it was an escapist movie. It was trimmed for its commercial run, but then, it didn't made sense and the rest is history, this film died at the box office.It's pure fantasy mixed with Eastern philosophy. Shangri La is modeled after a form of Californian Art Deco. Most of the interiors were ahead of its time, for the Hollywood of 1937. Unfortunately, it's a movie that's dated. The political incorrectness of the times is as offensive now, as it must have been then, but of course, no one questioned it at the time.The only pretext for taking a second view of the film is Ronald Colman. He was the perfect film hero of that era. He was a dashing presence in whatever he undertook in films. The cast is just as effective. Jane Wyatt, John Howard, Margo, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Stone, H.B. Wagner and Sam Jaffe were exceptional in their roles. It appears that with today's taste in New Age philosophy, this film hasn't been discovered by many more followers who would like to be taken to Shangri La, even if it is via this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To viewers coming to this film aware of its legendary reputation, Frank Capra's LOST HORIZON (1937) might prove to be a major disappointment. Ronald Colman is excellent, as is Thomas Mitchell, Sam Jaffe, and even the distressingly fey Edward Everett Horton, but the acting turned in by the rest of the cast is amateurish at best. Over-long, loosely structured, burdened with an excruciatingly corny musical score, LOST HORIZON is too earnest for its own good. Its overt, gooey sentimentality gets in the way of its Utopian ideals. There's also something a little disturbing about Shangra-La being established by a white Christian missionary, as if the native Tibetans weren't capable of such spiritual and moral sublimnity. Yet, as an expression of sincere longing for peace and sanity in a world on the edge of another world war, LOST HORIZON retains some historical interest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stock characters go to a silly utopia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The opening scenes of a quick escape, although scrappy, do promise more excitement than the film delivers. Yes there is some stunning cinematography but too much time is spent on stock comedy and long-winded 'utopian' speeches by the Grand Lama and others. It is telling that the most potentially exciting sequences of Coleman's frantic quest to return to Shangri-la are narrated near the end. We are told at length how daring and remarkable these are, but we do not see them.The rest of the film is as woolly as the Lama's ideas. Characters disappear when not needed. There is some dated comedy. Problems with motivations too, particularly why the Russian girl is so determined to leave this paradise, since she knows she will age rapidly when she does.But the real problem is the silliness of this utopia, from which the film cannot escape. It is noticeable that the Grand Lama is a white European and wishes another white European to succeed him. Quite how well this would go down with the locals is never explored. They are portrayed as contended children happy to serve their masters but incapable of thinking for themselves.This Utopia is a mixture of vague Buddhism and various progressive ideas of the time. The Lama's speech about how freedom from want would create a crime-free society seems ridiculous now, when we have seen how entitlement mentality actually increases crime levels. The idea of simple natives being ruled over by superiors was also progressive at the time as was the rather dated looking architecture.It is a pity, as stated in the first paragraph, that the more interesting story -that of Coleman's return- was not the subject of the film, with the waffle of this film being told in flashback. Such a film would be interesting and still could be made.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every time I review a Frank Capra movie, (one of my very favourite directors), I like to remind viewers that Capra has a consistent flair for INconsistency in his movies. In this offering, we have a commune of peaceniks high-jacking a plane to force a landing near Shangrila. The violence of that sequence always struck me as oddly inconsistent with the film's message.Some priest from Europe has started this wonderful place. But among the fine print in the group's doctrine ("be kind") is a willingness to allow wife swapping. Really. See for yourself.Truth be told, nearly all of Frank Capra's strongest films have some slightly racy, off-center element in it. Sometimes it's subtle, but it's usually there.I would expect better from a film espousing a high moral standard.Having got that off my chest ... Lost Horizon is an enjoyable film. Ronald Coleman will always carry more than his weight.</fullReview>

The storyline was engaging and the backdrop and camera-work were beautiful. However, I just couldn't help being ticked off with the performance of some cast members. Aside from Colman and Jaffe who gave subtle, realistic delivery of their lines, the rest of cast resort to hammy, over-the-top acting. Particularly the scene in the plane, just before they go down. Bob's brother was just awful - probably the worst acting performance I've ever seen. I would cringe every time he opened his mouth and was just hoping he would die somewhere early in the film. Couldn't blurt out a single line without resorting to screaming or yelling. Completely miscasted. Definitely messed up what was otherwise a good movie.

		<fullReview>Harry Cohn and Columbia studios allowed Frank Capra to turn the James Hilton Novel into what is today a classic gem of film making, that was very relevant to its day and today also. But Columbia also allowed the film to nearly disintegrate over the years and it was almost beyond redemption when a tattered print was handed over to The American Film Institute for repair. Indeed several scenes were beyond saving and they ended up sticking still photos in several places with voice recordings of the actors behind them.Still this beautiful film of a magic sanctuary away from the horrors of war was saved and is yet worth a look. It is many times better than the lame musical version done in 1973. Since the material behind the film is dated it will probably never be remade, and that would perhaps be for the best, as this story is a window into a specific time period, and the tendency of film makers is to "improve" on things which usually makes them much worse. If you get a chance see this lovely film. Perhaps watch it with "Goodbye Mr. Chips" another great film by Capra also based on a Hilton novel.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Find a Garden of Eden</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is truly a great classic film from 1937 with an all star cast of veteran actors and a great producer, Frank Capra. Ronald Colman,(Bob Conway); Jane Wyatt,(Sondra Bizet) were the stars of this picture along with great supporting actors: Edward Everett Horton, George Mitchell. Sam Jaffe (High Lama) gave an outstanding performance as the Supreme Lama with a soft spoken voice and a man full of deep wisdom and spiritual knowledge. This is a film about a Lost Horizon where most people want to go and live after experiencing the horrors of World War 1 &amp; 2. Bob Conway and his passengers were flying in an airplane when the pilot crashes into a mountain top and they are stranded in deep snow and it looks like there is absolutely no way to survive. One of the passengers finds some Mountain Grass and offers it to the other people on the plane, this Mountain Grass looks like big clumps of a dead plant. There is deep meaning to this film, which seems to indicate that men and women are still seeking to find another Garden of Eden where they can live in harmony with their other brother and sisters. However, man's human nature will never allow this to happen. Good Film Enjoy</fullReview>

		<fullReview>(some minor spoilers) MY RATING- 8.4This one was a mov I wanted along time ago and I was lucky to find it in Blockbuster. Geez, what a flick! It was directed by Frank Capra, but it's quite different from the typical `very american' movs he directs. Firstly, it's an adventure mov, and second it's fantasy too.It begins with an escape from the revolutionary China and the characters are presented- the british consul Ronald Colman and his brother, Thomas Mitchell the crook, the snob Edward Everett Horton and the ill-fated prostitute Isabel Jewell. The group has an airplane disaster (later to be copied by Indiana Jones and the Temple Of Doom) and a group of natives guide them to the wonderland, Shangri La, the place where the life is long and the motto is `to be kind'. They feel well in the place, as it's obvius and they intend to be there forever, specially Colman who falls in love with a beautiful girl (Jane Wyatt) But the younger brother doesn't feel well and wants to go back to civilization. Then we see one of the most shocking scenes on cinema, the girl he has fallen in love getting old as they escape. The finale has Colman getting back to his Shangri La as the only place far away from corruption of the world.The message of the mov is very clear as you see, in fact it's advanced for his time, since the hippies would take the oriental way in the 60's.The directing is very good and it's good to see Capra doesn't make only politic/american socio dramas. All of the cast is very good, specially Colman with his soft voice, no wonder women adored him!</fullReview>

Howard is annoyingly melodramatic as Colman's whiny brother. Horton and Mitchell provide the comic relief.

		<fullReview>Reading the comments about Lost Horizon there are differing views on this film. The majority seem to like it but the detractors forget the film was made in 1937. The dark clouds of war were gathering in Europe and the Japanese were in China. The 'Rape of Nanking' a Far-Eastern 'Holocaust' was just months away. A wished for safe haven away from reality is not surprising.**** The gawking of the callow youth from one comment and his "HA HA HA" comments ....? Well he will go far ! To the toilet at the end of the corridor as he escapes the classroom for a cigarette. The strong Christian view put a Biblical spin on it? He is always 'RIGHT' after all ! He has the book to refer to ?*****Enchanting with a few mistakes but what film doesn't contain mistakes ? Is the film relevant to today ? Just as much perhaps, even more so with the advent of the worship of materialism,money and dependency on drug taking to get a high. It is possible to get a 'High' in Shangri-La too.Likely based on 'The Legend of Shambhalla' there might be a search for Shangri-La in all of us. Nothing is ever certain in this World and you never know Shambhalla/Shangri-La might just exist ? A classic film in its own way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a marvelous film full of excellent acting, direction and especially cinematography. Although Ronald Coleman did MANY terrific films, this might be his best (though The Prisoner of Zenda is awfully good as well). It's pure escapist fun about a group that unexpectedly stumbles upon the magical land of Shangri-la. What makes it so watchable are there many different reactions to this paradise--some embrace it, some inexplicably want to leave and some are really torn between the two groups. About the only negative about the film is that some small sections of the film footage have been lost, though the soundtrack remains intact. As a result, you'll have a few tiny sections where there are only movie stills as the dialog is being spoken. It really doesn't detract too much in the restored version, but be prepared.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In "Lost Horizon," a change of pace for director Frank Capra, a charter plane carrying a group of character actors crashes somewhere over Asia, and they stumble their way into the forgotten city of Shangri-La, tucked cosily away amid the snowy mountains, where the cadaverous H.B. Warner prowls around in bare feet and a kimono. Shangri-La seems like an ideal place to while away one's hours, not the least because of its groovy art-deco production design, but before long everyone starts to get bored with how nice and bland the inhabitants are, and creeped out by Warner's ability to materialize out of nowhere at the most inopportune moments (he's definitely what "Seinfeld's" Elaine would call a sidler)."Lost Horizon" is actually sort of poky and dull, and I was fairly disinterested in what happened to the characters by the time the movie was over. There's a love story between Ronald Colman and a pretty young thing who gets a hankering to leave the peaceful place--her storyline contributes to the movie's overall creepiness--is she being held there against her will? But ultimately this love story is same old, same old, all melodramatic swooning and fuzzy closeups. My favorite performance came from Thomas Mitchell, who excelled at playing loud-mouthed obnoxious Americans, and does the same honors here.Kudos to Capra for trying something a little different; too bad the result was a rather hum-drum movie.Grade: B-</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A remarkable, spiritually significant film; of special interest to anyone interested in the evolution of humanity's awareness of Shamballa..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I write as a sincere student of yoga and esoteric spiritual science. This film was brought to my attention by a excellent teacher of what is known as 'the Ageless Wisdom' or 'the golden thread' which ties together the inner teachings of the world's religions in a very unique way. In large measure, the Ageless Wisdom is the spiritual science the majority of the 'Founding Fathers' were students or initiates of. (To widely varying degrees, of course.) [see the book 'Spiritual Politics' for details about this.] 'Lost Horizon' is of tremendous cultural significance because it really put the 'archetype' of 'Shangri-La' into the popular culture and mass consciousness in a very powerful and inspiring way.This is significant from a spiritual perspective for several reasons. First, the film is rather universal in it's appeal to people's sense of goodwill and their 'higher selves'. It encourages people to think in fresh terms about what is possible. This is widely regarded as the first stage 'on the path' of spiritual aspiration. The characters in the film represent a wide range of human spiritual development, and the differences in the way they each respond to being in 'Shangri-La', including each person's changes or 'journey' during their time there, are quite instructive.Secondly, and more esoterically, there is the matter of the relationship between 'Lost Horizon's 'Shangri-La' and what is known in the Ageless Wisdom as 'Shamballa'. Students of spiritual science would say the film is significant because it took a very real step in the protracted process of making humanity aware that a 'center' of spiritual significance to all of humanity, located in a region of the Himalayas which even today is uncharted and essentially inaccessible (as hard as that must surely be for many to swallow) is, at least in some sense, real. [ Anyone who is interested in looking into such matters in greater depth could study the fairly well-known series of books by Alice Bailey and Djwhal Khul, aka 'The Tibetan'. ]The film is chock full of fairly sophisticated spiritual 'vignettes', if I may use such a description. The scenes where our highly respected protagonist encounters the 'High Lama' and is deeply moved to re-consider his entire life are truly classics of Hollywood filmmaking. And one very quick 'blurb' I found fascinating was the brief mention the paleontologist makes to having just translated a book about the meaning of Masonic symbols which he found in the collection there in Shangri-La. All Americans would benefit from a study of everything which is 'going on' on the back of our one dollar bill. It has both sides of our 'Great Seal' which was designed by Jefferson, Adams and Franklin at the time of our nation's founding but was not put onto the dollar bill until Henry Wallace, FDR's first Treasury Secretary advised FDR to do so in 1932 after receiving guidance from a very advanced spiritual teacher who lived in the Himalayas. (Wallace had been a student of Nicholas Roerich, the Russian artist and visionary, in the 19-teens. The revelation of their correspondence, which became known as his 'guru papers', scuttled his later presidential candidacy.) The central symbol is the four-sided pyramid (representing this nation's abundant material wealth), upon which is slowly being lowered the 'eye of wisdom' or spiritual insight, which must eventually come to be our guiding influence if we are to live up to our destiny and the high ideals set out in our founding documents. While still not widely understood even today, these matters were still very new topics of discussion at the time 'Lost Horizon' was made.But, in my view, it's the parts with the 'High Lama' which are the really significant parts of this film. Certainly even the most secular reviewer would agree that he is intended to be regarded as something of a spiritual master. Our 'public hero' protagonist is certainly deeply moved by him. In the Ageless Wisdom it is said that the 'Masters of Wisdom' act as direct links to the spiritual realm where God's will is known -- called "Shamballa" in the teachings of the East or the "Abode of the Father" in the Christian teachings. This is a center of consciousness and energy where very advanced beings receive and hold the energy of Divine Will for planet Earth. Shamballa is said to be the mystical city of enlightenment sometimes referred to as "Shangri-la" in the world's literature, but it is actually located on the inner planes. It is said that the Enlightened Ones mediate the powerful energy released from Shamballa, "stepping down" its power by translating it through compassion, into a plan for earth's evolution in progressive steps that humanity can accomplish. The full impact of this energy was, until recently, too stimulating of the will aspect and humanity was not yet prepared for its right use. The Lord's Prayer, which Jesus first gave to the world, was an example of a prayer that invoked the will of God and anchored it on earth. Again, 'Spiritual Politics' has more on this topic.Lastly, I think that Capra did a excellent job casting this film. It is full of outstanding performances. For instance, Jane Wyatt is tremendous in her relatively small part. She convincingly stands toe-to-toe with our older protagonist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Falling out of Shangri-la and ancient tyranny</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Lost Horizon" (1937) directed by Frank Capra put the reign of Shangri-la on the map, with an airplane catastrophe in which the act of filming it barely seems as if it was a known documentary of the March of Time. This movie was a huge success in the career of Capra, for the first time it seems too, maybe because the novel was a best-seller and its adaptation to the screen of snow at a strange distance from another fake reality, surely as though the moon wasn't a better place to holidays of illusion for happiness. After such a deal, within the group of survivors from the fall of the plane, in a kind of conservationist way of understanding without much compromise the elderly life, as if it was before it arrives to everybody in the future, whether staying alive till there as nowhere in prospective imagination. Even by the paleontology and the myth of unlimited timing for oldness on the mountains, like there as searchers of another kind of richness : the special effect of the face as figure of wax, in which by an effect of candle it is decomposed before our eyes - when coming out of Shangri-la - is so terrific for the viewer at the time, like if it was as the same in such a given human beings after being inside the burning of a blaze. Pictures from the unknown lost world of the abominable man of the snows at the beginning sequence, making the viewer scaring for the life of the group, whom escaping from tyranny and where they are there as a few survivors from it. After the plane crash, all them also they must go out for safety and being just inside a valley of snow among mountains, like if searching the whereabouts of the Mallory's expedition near the Himalayas. Nearby too, there is an old people whose style of life is quite authoritarian, even though it is not so bad meanwhile, because the longevity of their lives and the absence of corruption or greed and even without deceases. Briefly, a Utopian society encircled by a barrier of snowed mountains and the mystery of long life. For searching a lost world of damned souls, outside of the conventions from the shores of the continents. Opposing mountains from the trail of these human samples of high society, not so much disturbed for not paying such imposing taxes, but adhering to a sort of primitive communism forgotten by the masters of the Nineteenth Century. It is all this the core of that foolish story of a bit of mankind for travelers, in which they were accidentally driven by the winds and their unconsciousness to a reign conducted by a clever tyrant. Whose conception was drive them to such a dead end of another kind of immortality, after escaping with their lives from a plane accident as others at the time. The best-seller from where Capra extracts this sens of fortune, for the heterogeneity of the movie - as clear rule of the group of selfish people, reunified as a set in quest with long lives - it is quite of bad taste. Sometimes, with the honorable exception from the animated scenes at the palace, in a diplomatic high level of imbecility as fake purpose to switch the power and bringing exploitation as it was before. Thus, a foolish community as previous antidote against the proximity of the war, near their frozen noses at the time and with the purpose of an erratic off-deal for the future of mankind. Capra with his funny side of tragedy, such as maybe it was here in 1937, comes to us as an old man by anticipation of his own mind - still with a lot of overacting principles of acting. Like an intriguing imitation of Pirandello's skeptical comedy of eternal values under universal suspect - as in this movie. Even though less quite exhibitionist in style and much more concentrated inside a story of senility and clever mind.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Classic When I Was Young and Stupid</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day when I was still in school, I mentioned to my Dad that Lost Horizon (reissue) was playing at the Langley for one night only. A strict man my Dad, he nonetheless told me there are lots of nights for homework; forget the homework and see Lost Horizon. I was extremely impressed with the film at that time. But that was then, and I'm a grown-up now.Giving Frank Capra, James Hilton, Ronald Coleman and others due credit, this intellectual fantasy was created in a year when the World was just about to contend with Adolf Hitler, Bonito Moussolini, Jeseph Stalin,and Emperor of Japan in one unprecedented outbreak of death, destruction and depression. So-called pacifists, John Lennon airheads on crack, those who "give peace a chance" by staying stoned, have embraced this picture without first getting the OK from Frank Capra or any of the others who soon became war heroes and fought against the dual forces of evil. Who can blame them a few years earlier for this day dream about Shangri-la, a peaceful land in the Himilayas.After being skyjacked, Ronald Coleman and the others find themselves trapped in this Shangri-la place where everybody walks around in robes, with luxurious accommodations that shame the Ritz in comparison. With lots of good food and work being minimal and voluntary, it looks to me as a living Hell of boring living, jail-time in luxury. Coleman loves the place, but the others are itching to get out, to escape paradise.The real paradise, as everyone in 1937 knew, was actually in Tarzan's tree-house; a sharp improvement on Lost Horizon's Shangri-la. There was never any pseudo-intellectual pretense with Tarzan, but the primary difference is that Tarzan's world offered the basic human necessity of challenge and motivation; the difference really between humans and plants. In Tarzan's paradise, he and Jane's ideal life was interrupted once a year (with every new movie) by the (God bless 'em) BAD GUYS! This required Tarzan, Jane, Boy, Cheetah, as well as the elephants, to stretch their abilities to the maximum until order was restored. This is what life is all about; not loafing about in Shangri-la.Instead of wasting time on Lost Horizon, look up Alan Ladd and Deborah Kerr in Thunder in the East (try eBay). Therein Charles Boyer plays the leader of a small kingdom in the Himilayas and has similar ideas about "peace." His kingdom is challenged by a cutthroat band of Taliban-like thugs, but Boyer has his pacifist "ideals" which include locking up the guns and crossing his fingers that the thugs go away. Alan Ladd will save the day, of course, by killing the bad guys just as Boyer meets the fate of appeasement by quick and violent death. There are, conveniently, no thugs or bad guys in Shangri-la. Isn't that sweet! OK, so why score Lost Horizon with an 8? Strip away the intellectual pretense and it's a fine adventure movie; better than what's made today.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mr. Capra, meet M. Rousseau</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The world can be a trying place, and usually is. It would be nice to get away from it all for a while, and Shangri La is better than Club Med. The white folks work if they feel like it, doing nice things like teaching kids, or just wandering about the big house. That big house is really something. It was created by the production designer Stephen Gooson and is a direct outgrowth of the Bauhaus cum Streamline Moderne of the 1925 Paris Exposition. It was wildly popular in the 1930s, especially in Hollywood, where it was used in several Astaire/Rogers musicals. Later the style came to be called Art Deco. The glimpses we have of people actually working, engaged in what might be called the behavioral infrastructure of the community, show us nothing but people of color. In one scene, Edward Everet Horton is shown wandering around this immaculate mansion whittling at a stick with a sword. Okay. Who sweeps up the Schnipfles, and when? Having labored at the bottom of the socioeconomic totem pole for some years, I can't help watching a movie like this (let alone something like, say, "Star Wars") without wondering who butchers the cattle, who takes out the garbage, and who cleans the septic tanks? But this is being unfair to the movie because it's a fairy tale. Questioning it's material or spiritual details is like stretching an iridescent butterfly on the rack. And there is, after all, some food for thought in it. In one exchange, a character asks, "What would happen if everyone came to Shangri La?" Another answers: "Then it wouldn't remain a paradise for long."Half a dozen characters are kidnapped and taken to a remote mountain community so that the leadership of this ashram can be handed over to one of them, namely Ronald Coleman. (It's kind of a dirty trick on the others, but it all works out, except for one malcontent who is young and impatient.) Coleman is the suitable inheritor of the leadership because he has the kind of wisdom that comes with age. In the novel, he explains this by emphasizing how old he is -- "I'm thirty-seven." (A slight chuckle from half the audience wouldn't be inappropriate here.) The kidnapees are a varied group. Horton is gay and it's played for laughs.Thomas Mitchell, a white collar criminal on the lam, keeps teasing Horton, calling him "Toots" and inviting him to play "Honeymoon bridge." Mitchell's girl friend is a bitter tubercular whore who learns to lose the makeup and recovers her health and good spirits in the process. Horton begins to teach geology. Mitchell organizes some kind of pipeline business. Mitchell and the beautiful Jane Wyatt, who looks particularly good in the nude, come from opposite ends of the social spectrum in New Jersey -- Campgaw and Elizabeth. Nixon played golf at a country club near Campgaw, whereas airplanes seemed to go out of their way to crash in Elizabeth. Coleman agrees to accompany his impatient brother and the brother's girl friend on an escape attempt over the snowy mountains. Avalanche: disaster. Avalanches are treated pretty lightly in the movies but I don't know why. I was halfway up the side of a low but jagged mountain at Maligne Lake in the Canadian Rockies, the circular ridge forming a kind of mountainous cup. The cloud base was just above me and I couldn't see any of the peaks through the drizzle, when I heard the ominous rumble of rocks -- BIG rocks -- echoing off the interior of the crater. I had no idea where the two-minute-long sound was coming from but it was clearly nothing to dismiss. At any rate the movie ends more or less happily. To ask anything more of it than entertainment would be like asking if Little Red Riding Hood or Grandmother actually lived in gingerbread houses. Accept it on its own terms and it makes you smile with its naiveté and its good nature. It's a neat expression of what was to become part of Frank Capra's theme, not to mention all those noble savages in Tibet. You wouldn't guess from this movie that the Western Tibetans are polyandrous, meaning that women have more than one husband. All those lines coming from Chang about how jealousy is overcome in Shangri La -- "It would be considered bad manners for a man to keep a woman from another man" -- take on a strange new meaning.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Timeless story now seems a bit dated...even the acting styles...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Frank Capra's 'Lost Horizon' is a pretty faithful rendering of the James Hilton novel--but by today's standards much of it looks very dated. Particularly noticeable are the acting styles--Isabel Jewell over-emotes terribly as the prostitute with the hacking cough. Even veteran actor Thomas Mitchell overplays his hand in attacking Edward Everett Horton's character as the fussy paleolithic scientist and becomes somewhat of a nuisance. John Howard also slips into old-style acting as Colman's selfish brother. Margo, too, is guilty of a bit of overacting. By contrast, Ronald Colman and Jane Wyatt give perfectly natural performances. And Sam Jaffe is magnificent as the aged leader of Shangri-La, proving his worth again later for 'Gunga Din'.The sets are magnificent and the restored version furnishes stills of the missing footage. And by the way, the score is by Franz Waxman (not Max Steiner as another viewer says). The well-known story has become legendary as even today, everyone searches for their own private Shangri-La where death is unknownDespite the flaws, the film is an interesting excursion into a sort of Himalayan fantasy-land that James Hilton created. Far superior to the 1973 musical remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hello Dalai</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's almost classically simple to sit in the 21st century and analyze/pass judgment on the films of previous generations, notably films produced in Hollywood at the time a second world war was a distinct possibility and when this proved the case, during the actual conflict itself and given the setting perhaps Robert Sherwood's Idiot's Delight is a title that springs readily to mind focusing as it does on a disparate group of travellers caught in a remote mountain location - even in France they were not immune and Jacques Prevert wrote a fine screenplay which featured the two Madeleines (Robinson, Renaud) popular at the time, along with Pierre Brasseur. Ronald Coleman could hardly be bettered as the world weary diplomat more than ready to leave the rat race behind and if today even his name is fading from memory at the time the other members of the cast, Thomas Mitchell, Edward Everett Horton, H.B. Warner, Sam Jaffe would have been recognizable as solid supporting actors rather than known by name. Watching it for the first time some seventy odd years after the initial release it perhaps fails to impress as much as it would have done at the time but it is nevertheless highly watchable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Other than the magnificent cinematography, this film was a classic clinker of major proportions.Ronald Colman acts like Charles Darnay of Tale of 2 Cities Fame. Ironically, Isabelle Jewell, the condemned seamstress in that 1935 classic, plays a dying brassy blonde in this film. She makes a lot of noise and adds plenty of tension is some vivid screaming outbursts. Unfortunately, for the film, little was made of her for about most of the film.From out of nowhere-Colman is supposed to replace Sam Jaffe in Shangri-La as the Dalai Lama. I thought no one dies in this Garden of Eden, which to me was more like a wintry Wisconsin mixed in with Florida. Yet, Jaffe, as the Lama, does close his eyes.Margo plays a little liar here only to coax John Howard, who plays Colman's brother in the film, to take her out of this place. Margo should have cried tomorrow, as she did 18 years later. In addition, H.B. Warner received a best supporting actor bid for this film. Would anyone dare to venture why?Jane Wyatt plays Colman's love interest. She certainly didn't know best here at all.Colman would have been better served by doing a far, far better thing by running from this film.The story in itself is tedious and quite dull to say the least.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really appreciate AFI's restoration effort in the 1980s to restore footage to "Lost Horizon". It was a great project. It showed love for the film to undertake a project to make the movie closest to director Capra's (and writer Hilton's) vision. For a couple of sequences they had audio and no footage. Luckily, they had stills from the sequence and they had courage to go ahead and put them in. I'm wondering if any new restoration has been initiated. It could be possible that new footage has been found since the first restoration. I believe I read where more footage and scenes are known to still be missing. I love "Director's Cuts and Editions" for certain films. "Lost Horizon" certainly qualifies as this kind of film. It begs to be complete. It is in the same category as "Lawrence of Arabia".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first half hour of this movie is unusually good. Capra shoots darker than most movies of the time. An impromptu explosion that lights up the night is striking. And the logic of the first setpiece of a plane diverted to a secret destination is smart and beautiful to watch. It's really perfect adventure storytelling, and quite ahead of its time in pacing and excitement.But once we land in Shangri-La, critical faults in the films conception appear. Capra doesn't understand complexity; the basic rule of utopias is that there's no way to depict Utopia that doesn't immediately point out the non-Utopian aspects (flaws) of the vision. Here "not working" and "lazing about in pajamas," are supposed to look appealing. But it just forced two issues for me: What if I find work personally fulfilling? And wearing pajamas, making idle chatter all day makes me feel like a sloth... not at peace. These are really immature fantasy motifs. Shangri-La also evinces a sameness from moment to moment that's stultifying. Treating this overlong movie like each ruined segment was another piece of the true cross does not help things.Then there's that fantasy architecture. It's deco and it's ten percent windows. I have no idea how they get fresh air into those spaces.</fullReview>

The background choral music is quite insistent and catching. Viewing it once more as an adult, however, I found the plot improbable and somewhat silly. SPOILER: The lead character is kidnapped along with his companions upon the instructions of supposedly peaceful, non-violent and well-intentioned leaders of a paradisaical community high in the mountains of Tibet. The kidnapping was clumsily executed which almost ended in the death of the whole party.The set designers sought to bring the feel of an unknown civilization by using architecture that looks suspiciously like that of the Bahaus school. By the 1950's Bauhaus had become commonplace and even today scenes of that Shangrila seems laughable.SPOILER: The 300 year-old High Lama turns out to be a Jesuit missionary priest, again very highly unlikely considering that he was now preaching entirely another kind of gospel -- that of long extended life. But looking at the Lama (Sam Jaffe) is like looking at Death itself (he is missing a leg and uses a crutch) so his spiel is not quite convincing.</fullReview>

I do! I do!" or some such nonsense.In a ten-year-old, such an attitude is cute; coming from an adult, it's contemptible.It's tempting to point out that such ideas must have looked especially seductive in 1937, with the devastation of World War I less than 20 years in the past, and new wars looming on every horizon. But it is at such times (times very much like those we are living in now) that it is most incumbent upon adults to deal with the world the way it is rather than retreating into infantile delusions.</fullReview>

Even though the story is set in the far corners of Tibet and the protagonist is an Englishman, the story goes to great lengths to cement the "American Dream" of the 1930s-- pro-white, pro-male, pro-Protestant.The leaders of this Tibetan paradise are white rather than Asian, the "High Lama", a Buddhist title, is actually a Belgium priest, and the women of the film aren't depicted as anything more than hysterical, irrational screamers. Even the film's promising female lead ends up throwing away her rationality and sophistication to run screaming and crying into the snow.But, if you can go beyond its racist, sexist story, there is a seed of great cinema. Capra's cinematography of the "Tibetan" landscape is beautiful, the sets are amazing for that period, and Ronald Colman's performance is nothing short of charming.Basically, the film is good for two things: First, it's an amazing, warm-fuzzy movie for all those needing a logic-free escape into paradise. Second, it provides an interesting historical perspective on just how far we've leaped in our portrayals of women and the non-Western world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>50s B movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on R2 DVD 128 minMaking a 50s B movie in 1937 is no mean feat, though it's hard to see where the; at the time; astronomical budget went the movie was obviously a tour de force in it's day.Like real 50s B movies there are silly screaming females, dumb bit players like the mountain guides who like to fire pot shots while surrounded by millions of tonnes of piled very high snow etc etcThe restoration is very good though and almost complete it begs the question why Hollywood wants eternal copyright when it manages to lose such classics in less than forty years.7/10 well worth watching - 2 points added for being 2 decades ahead of its time</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie is a romantic tear jerker! Great movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was a very romantic, tear jerker! Ronald Coleman and Greer Garson are the premier actors. But it did have a happy ending! Even though this movie was made in 1937, it remains one of the best movies I've ever seen. It's a true classic, anda movie I would watch over and over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pompous, silly &amp; saccharine</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you believe the premise of this film you probably also believe in the Easter Bunny and Tooth Fairy. That's good; given the saccharine ozing from this overly sentimental, pretentious, and downright silly film you'll probably be getting a visit from the Tooth Fairy if you watch it too many times. But it will be for the dumb ideas rotting your brain.We find British diplomat Robert Conway helping "white" people escape revolution in China only to have their plane hijacked -- to Shangrila. Turns out Conway wants to solve the looming war in Europe by having the good guys lay down their arms and welcome the invaders. I suppose Neville Chamberlain's agreement with the Nazis really kept Britain out of the war....Amazingly the fleeing white characters fail to notice the reason the 10,000 peasants in China are about to be slaughtered is because they are unarmed and defenseless against the conquering hordes. No need to worry about little details like this however since it pays to be idealistic. If you're good at heart you get to go to Shangrila, even if your policies result in genocide, mass murder and totalitarian domination for the rest of the world. Gag me with a spoon, I gotta hurl.Premise, story, and acting aside this film is competently crafted. The Max Steiner music score is excellent as usual, and the sets and cinematography are great, easily some of the best from Hollywood's golden age. The restored version now in stores is very clean, though several of the missing segments are filled in with stills and voiceovers, and the effect is a bit jarring, like cutting to a slide show.This would be an entertaining film if it had more of a Wizard of Oz sentimentality. Probably more effective too. Lost Horizon takes itself so seriously as the savior of humanity that a visit to a vomitarium may be necessary after viewing, assuming you can make it that far.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a classic????</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HA HA HA HA HA, my english teacher had our class watch this movie in my freshman high-school year. We all laughed at how stupid and poorly acted it was. Seriously, I've seen porno performances that where more convincing. What I can't grasp is that this movie is considered to be an actual piece of cinema. Me and my classmates had thought our teacher played a terrible joke on us. Count the cliches. There's about 10 million of them in this so-called "masterpiece".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Lost Horizons is the desire of all mankind. Truly in the heart of man is the desire for eternity and the kingdom of heaven. The movie lays out the exact plight of man's search, even down to the point of the struggle that Conway made to return, after he realized that what he found was the only value to his continued reason for living. What money cannot buy, is eternal life. Eternal life can only be found by believing first and then seeing. That is the exact opposite to what man believes with his limited earthly human mind. But, with the expanded spiritual mind,which a man receives from believing first, he then can see and man can then believe and trust in the death, burial and resurrection of Jesus the Christ, that restores his separation from the creator, living God (SIN to be exact). Then the new spiritual mind can see and read and believe the truth provided by a loving God in the book called the Scriptures, also known as the Bible. or The Word. You would do well to be determined, as Conway, don't leave this world,without finding, it! Lost Horizions is the Shangra La that all human hearts desire, but only a few are willing to believe that it is real and that it exists and then they will find it. Each person, individually, must make and take this step to eternity with the living God.......or forever be separated from Shangra La. (Heaven)</fullReview>
