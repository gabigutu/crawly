		<shortDescription>Edward G. At The Top Of His Form.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>HOUSE OF STRANGERS is another classic from the Noir vaults of 20th Century Fox and is one of their very best. Under the guiding hand of the brilliant director Joseph L. Mankiewicz the film emerged in 1949 and remains to this day a remarkable piece of cinema! All credit must go to the excellent screenplay by Philip Yordan, the masterful low key black &amp; white cinematography of Milton Krasner and the atmospheric score by the Russian composer Daniele Amfitheatrof.The stellar cast is headed by the great Edward G. Robinson. Fresh from his wonderful Johnny Rocco in Houston's "Key Largo" Robinson plays Gino Monetti, the Italian immigrant who runs the bank he founded in New York's lower east side. He runs it with an iron fist as he does his family of four sons who work for him. Three of whom are resentful of him because of the poor wages he pays them and the domineering way he treats them. Robinson's Gino Monetti is a deftly crafted and skillful piece of acting and with just the right Italian accent the actor once again demonstrates that he was one of the finest players in American cinema. Watching him here one can't help but think what a fine Corleone he would have made had he been around (he died in 1972 the year "The Godfather" was released)Richard Conte, in one of his best parts, plays the loyal and favoured son Max Monetti with his trademark serious look and in his best oppressed hero style. The other siblings are played by Luther Adler as the oldest and meanest, Efrem Zimbalist as the ladies man and Paul Valentine excellent as a slow witted amateur pugilist. Romantic interest is supplied by the ever lovely and vivacious Susan Hayward whose star at this time was about to start its rise. But it is Robinson's movie from the moment he comes into it - you simply cannot take your eyes of him!Five years later the studio re-fashioned Yordan's screenplay (itself loosely based on Shakespeare's "King Lear") and turned it into a splendid western called "Broken Lance" with Spencer Tracy. This fact is strangely omitted from any text on the DVD?A curious footnote: At the end of the picture we don't hear Amfithetrof's finale music! What we get instead is the end title from Alfred Newman's score for "The Razor's Edge" (1946). Why and how this should be is anybody's guess! Apart from this sloppy denouement it is still a fine movie in a fine package which has a commentary,a trailer and a good behind the scenes still gallery.Classic line from "House Of Strangers".......... When one of Robinson's errant sons declines to help his father during his trial - "I'm sorry pop I don't want to stick my neck out" to which Robinson wryly inquires "Why - what's so good about your neck".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Every once in a while a great film comes along, and is somehow forgotten over a period of time...but is still well worth watching!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film appears in John Springer's movie book "Forgotten Films to Remember" by Citadel Press, and certainly lives up to it's name! It is a dark movie about the dysfunctional Monetti family. The late great Edward G. Robinson portrays Gino Monetti, the controlling patriarch banker father that rules his family with an iron fist. Richard Conte gives a sterling performance as the well meaning faithful son, Max Monetti. He takes a prison rap for embezzlement for his aging father. While he is in prison he helplessly learns that his brothers Joe (Luther Adler), Tony (Edward Zimbalist Jr., and Pietro (Paul Valentine plan to take over the family banking business. As a result of this his father dies. Max returns home from prison focused on revenge. Fortunately, Max's girlfriend (Susan Hayward)convinces him that the revenge he seeks is not worth it. Realizing that his father Gino was the real source of hatred and evil in the family, he decides to peacefully leave town with his girlfriend, but is soon confronted by his evil brothers. Amazingly this 1949 film was re-made in 1954 as a Western of all things! The title of the re-make was "Broken Lance". Same story different setting. Spencer Tracy (Controlling Rancher Father) plays the Robinson (Controlling Banker father) part, Robert Wagner plays the Conte part (Faithful son), Richard Widmark plays the Adler part (Ambitious older brother), Hugh O'Brien plays the Zimbalist part, and Earl Holliman plays the Valentine part (strong arm brother). Both films share a powerful script and good performances. Worth seeing!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A TRIUMVIRATE OF SUPERB ACTING</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"House of Strangers" features three of my all-time favorite actors--Edward G. Robinson, Susan Hayward and Richard Conte--all at the very top of their form, as well as moody, almost noirish direction by the great Joseph L. Mankiewicz, in moody black and white. Those ingredients alone should indicate that a fine work is in store for the viewer, and such, happily, is the case here. The tale is told mainly in flashback, in which we learn how the four sons of Lower East Side banker Edward G. became enemies after their Pop got into some legal trouble. Susan Hayward, never more beautiful, plays a high-class dame who becomes involved with lawyer Conte, despite Conte's engagement to a proper Italian girl from "the old country." The relationship between Hayward and Conte is very adult for the restrictive late '40s. By the film's end, we really come to care about these two and hope that they can survive as a couple. As usual, Edward G. gives a bravura performance, this time as the domineering patriarch of his Italian clan. I believe his performance received a well-deserved award at Cannes that year. Conte and Hayward, both of whose careers are ripe for reevaluation and rediscovery, match him every step of the way. Luther Adler is fine also, in his role as Conte's elder brother, who feels he never got the respect he deserved. Deborah Paget, in one of her earliest parts, looks fine in a decorative role. For me, though, the main lure of this picture is the triumvirate of superb acting by the three leads. What a pleasure it is to watch these three great talents do justice to the well-written script here. I just love this movie, and suspect that a real treat is in store for the first-time viewer. Check it out, by all means!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smoothly crafted studio product.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of those well-crafted films from Twentieth-Century Fox when that studio employed some extraordinary talents both before and behind the cameras. Although he wasn't a Fox contractee, Edward G. Robinson gives a great performance as a wealthy Italian family's patriarch and he is well-matched by everyone else in the cast, especially Richard Conte, Luther Adler, and Susan Hayward, looking terrifically classy. The script bears some obvious signs of being polished by the director, Joseph L. Mankiewicz, and the technical credits are absolutely top-drawer.Remade as a Western in CinemaScope and Color by DeLuxe in 1954, entitled "Broken Lance" with Spencer Tracy cast as the domineering father, the direction by Edward Dmytryk was not up to the standard of this earlier film with its then contemporary setting. This one is available on video (and seems to be very rarely exhumed on TV now) and is definitely worth a look.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Banking in Little Italy in the 1930s</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson played many ethnic types in his career, including sinister Chinese types in THE HATCHET MAN and Greek seamen in TIGER SHARK. But he played many Italian - Americans, mostly involved in criminal activities. Best known is his Rico Bandello in LITTLE CAESAR, but he also did Remy Marko in A SLIGHT CASE OF MURDER. And there is the more respectable, but still illegal gentleman in this film, Gino Monetti. Living in the middle of Little Italy in a mansion, Monetti started out as a barber, living in a single room with his wife Theresa (Esther Minciotti), and his four sons. They grow up to be Joe (Luther Adler), Max (Richard Conte), Tony (Efrem Zimberlist Jr.), and Pietro (Paul Valentine).Monetti's views of his Italian heritage and his adopted land's culture are mixed. He loves the music of his homeland - he's frequently playing opera (Rossini's THE BARBER OF SEVILLE sung by Lawrence Tibbett is heard at one point on his record player). He does have a sense of tradition: every Wednesday Theresa cooks a big dinner for the family, and everyone has to come (including Max's fiancé Maria Domenico - Debra Paget - and her mother Helena Domenico - Hope Emerson - and Joe's wife Elena - Diana Douglas). Gino will talk about how different life in America is, where a man does not have to forever be in the same job as his father, or where cities grow upward due to skyscrapers. But he treats three of his sons as servants. Joe, who is his oldest, is asked to scrub Gino's back in the bathtub, or has to chauffeur his father around, and is only a clerk in the bank (although called first Vice President). Pietro is referred to as "dumb-head" because he likes to work on a boxing career rather than an office job. Tony is a lady's man, always quiet and well dressed, and dismissed by his father as a weakling. Only Max has gained the old man's respect - he became an attorney (and a pretty good one).The bank itself is a mixed concern. When Frank Puglia asks for a $150.00 loan to buy a horse, he only gets $120.00 as $30.00 is taken off the top as interest on the new loan (later the loan has escalated to being $280.00). A poor woman needing money, however, gets the money without any interest being given. It later develops that Gino is lousy with bookkeeping, and resents government interest in his bank, but he is an intelligent banker, on the whole a decent guy, but he occasionally turns into a usurer.Max, although engaged to Maria, meets a socialite named Irene Bennett (Susan Hayward), who initially hires him to help an ex-boyfriend who robbed her. They gradually get into an affair, which threatens the engagement to Maria. Hayward's jealousy eventually leads to a break in it. At just that time, government actions close the bank and lead to a trial for Gino on serious fraud charges. Max tries to defend him, but he finds Gino too hot-tempered on the witness stand. He talks about the case with Joe (who is not too interested in whether the old man goes to jail or not), and says that possibly if they bribe a juror they can save Gino. Joe refuses to help. Max tries to bribe the juror, but finds himself arrested instead. It results in his disbarment and seven years in prison. Gino is not sent to prison, but finds the bank reorganized by Joe, Tony, and Pietro, and he is put out to pasture. Still Gino encourages hatred in Max to his brothers, pointing out that Joe probably tipped off the police about the bribery attempt.So Max leaves prison to confront his three siblings, and to see if he can resume life with Irene. And Joe, Tony (who has married Maria), and Pietro wonder if Max is going to be a troublemaker.The film captured an aspect of life on the lower East side rarely shown in films - how did banks work in those immigrant enclaves? This was before major banks had branches around the cities, and small local banks (like Monetti's) were common. And were run in the same haphazard manner until the Depression made the government take a closer look. The film, directed by Joseph Mankiewicz, crackles with good dialog (and steamy lines too - particularly between Conte and Hayward). Robinson's Gino is memorable - not a really bad man, but one who forgot certain simple family rules regarding his sons. Even minor characters have good moments: Hope Emerson's fury at Conte's flaunting his affair with Hayward leads to a confrontation scene, and the dinner at the Monetti's reveals how Diana Douglas (Kirk's wife) is a non-Italian mainliner that Luther Adler married, who barely likes her in-laws (she can't stand spaghetti dinners, and wants him to have a promised raise so she can entertain HER friends). It is a rewarding movie about social mobility and it's pitfalls in the urban immigrant circles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Caesar Owning a Bank</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Try and imagine Little Caesar getting out of the rackets and taking his hard stolen loot and setting up a bank. Then Mr. Bandello marries and has four sons.You've got Gino Monetti who now that he's no longer terrorizing citizens confines his terrors to his own family. He's got four grown sons and he treats them like the hired help. All except Richard Conte who instead of working for him directly at the bank uses the bank's space for his law office.I think that's the key to this film. The other three sons Luther Adler, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., and Paul Valentine all do work for him and he can treat them like dirt. Conte on the other hand, does not work for him, he's made his own career. By Robinson's logic, he's earned a certain amount of respect.So he pits them against each other. Unfortunately Robinson's banking practices which are not exactly legal catch up with him. He's forced to turn the bank over to the three sons in an effort to save the bank. Conte also tries to bribe a juror to save dear old Dad and gets disbarred and a stretch of seven years in prison for his troubles. Conte's out now and looking to even things up with his siblings.Robinson who's played all kinds of immigrants of many nationalities has covered the Italian ground before. But he's real good as the scheming, sadistic patriarch who in fact gets a deserved comeuppance from his sons. All four sons are fine in their roles with Richard Conte and Luther Adler deserving particular attention.Susan Hayward is the girl who waits for Conte. She must be in love with him. A disbarred attorney isn't exactly a dream prospect. She was just entering into the height of her career and this role was a career boost.House of Strangers is far superior to the western setting remake that 20th Century Fox did five years later entitled Broken Lance</fullReview>

		<fullReview>An Italian-American family is the subject of "House of Strangers," a 1949 film starring Edward G. Robinson, Richard Conte, Susan Hayward, Luther Adler, Debra Paget, Hope Emerson, and Efrem Zimbalist, Jr. Being of Italian extraction myself, I actually thought this film was written by an Italian and was surprised to see it wasn't. It was dead on.Edward G. Robinson is Gino Monetti, who owns a bank in the '30s. He runs it like he's selling items out of his garage, with lousy bookkeeping, some people being charged interest up front on loans and some getting more money than they asked for. He has four sons, three of whom he treats like second-class citizens: Pietro is a guard at the bank by day and an amateur boxer by night, Joe is a teller, and Tony is a clerk. When Joe, who married a woman from a good Philadelphia family, asks for a raise he was promised, he gets a lecture from Gino about how the family lived in the back of a barber shop when Gino made $15 a week. When Pietro loses a boxing match, Gino takes the jacket off of his shoulders that says "Monetti Bank." Gino runs his home with more rigidity than he does his bank: His wife doesn't say much, and he has mandatory Wednesday night spaghetti dinners during which he plays opera recordings such as "Il Barbiere di Siviglia" starring Lawrence Tibbett.Gino has a favored child, and that's Max, his lawyer son. When the Feds start investigating Gino, Max comes up with a solution. If all the brothers will take responsibility for the sloppiness at the bank, the Feds won't be able to pin anything on anybody. But the sons refuse to lift a finger to help their father, ultimately forcing him out and starting their own bank. Max goes to prison for attempting to bribe a juror, and when he gets out, he's bent on revenge against his brothers.The acting is this film is nothing short of fantastic. Robinson is perfect as the dictatorial, ruthless Gino. Conte is totally believable as the favorite son - efficient and slightly to the right of slimy. Luther Adler gives a brilliant performance as the henpecked Tony. The rest of the cast is uniformly excellent. Susan Hayward plays Max's love interest, a woman who gives as good as she gets. She looks sensational and does a terrific job in her role. Stardom is right around the corner for her, and it's no surprise.With a great pace kept by Joseph Mankiewicz, this is a film that I'm surprised we don't hear more about. It just goes to show that there were so many great films made in Hollywood in the past that even some marvelous ones are overlooked. "House of Strangers" is definitely one to see and remember.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just superb. I can't believe I had not even heard of it, hopefully this DVD release will help it find a new audience and some deserved critical acclaim. It's billed as film noir, but it really isn't; it's more an extremely complex, suspenseful family drama. But that doesn't even do it justice. The screenplay is terrific, subtle, thoughtful, and at the same time, razor sharp. Some of the exchanges between Conte and Hayward in particular are electrifying. Talk about two 'tough cookies' that ignite when they get together. And you really begin to care deeply about what happens to them. (All of the acting is top notch, across the board.) And then there is the direction by Joseph L. Mankiewicz. The movie is so beautifully crafted and feels as if it could have been made yesterday, it's gritty and urban and fresh. The composition in the movie has deep meaning in just about every shot, and is gorgeous to behold besides. Watch this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just bought this and was looking forward to watching as I like all the main actors and am a film noir fan. This title is being marketed as a film noir - it's a good movie - but it definitely isn't a noir. I certainly don't stick to the narrow definition of a noir either.I won't bother to write a whole synopsis since that has been covered by earlier posts. Edward G Robinson never disappoints (even though he does kind of sound like Chico Marx in this) and Richard Conte is great. I hadn't seen Luther Adler in anything before but he was perfect in the role of the scorned older brother. Like I said it is a good movie...just don't expect a noir.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In New York, after seven years in prison, the lawyer Max Monetti (Richard Conte) goes to the bank of his brothers Joe (Luther Adler), Tony (Efrem Zimbalist Jr.) and Pietro Monetti (Paul Valentine) and promises revenge to them. Then he visits his lover Irene Bennett (Susan Hayward) that asks him to forget the past and start a new life.Max recalls the early 30's, when he is the favorite son of his father Gino Monetti (Edward G. Robinson), who has a bank in the East Side. Gino is a tyrannical and egocentric self-made man that raises his family in an environment of hatred and Max is a competent lawyer engaged with Maria Domenico (Debra Paget). When Max meets the confident Irene, he has a troubled love affair with her. In 1933, with the new Banking Act reaches Gino for misapplication of funds. Max plots a plan to help his father but is betrayed by his brothers. Now Max will see his brothers that have also being raised under the motto "Never Forgive, Never Forget"."House of Strangers" is a magnificent film-noir by Joseph L. Mankiewicz with a great story of hatred and forgiveness. Edward G. Robinson has one of his best performances (if not the best) and wins the Best Actor award in the 1949 Cannes Film Festival. Richard Conte has one of his best roles (if not the best) in his well-succeeded career. Susan Hayward is very beautiful and elegant and performs a strong female character. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): Not Available</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great 1949 drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This masterful adaptation of Jerome Weidman's novel stars Edward G. Robinson (arguably his best performance) as an Italian immigrant turned successful and wealthy banker. His hard-nosed attitude alienates three of his sons (portrayed by Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Paul Valentine and the always superb Luther Adler). His fourth son (the film noir regular, Richard Conte) however worships the ground his dad walks on. This doesn't go over so well with his brothers.Although billed as a film noir, the film is as much a family drama as a thriller - and an extremely good one. Excellent screenplay by Philip Yordan. Robinson won the best actor award at the Cannes Film Festival for his performance.</fullReview>

Marvelous Noir, following a family's greedy self destruction, Robinson is excellent as the Patriarch of the family, even if his accent is a little like an iceA creamA seller. Conte of course gives his usual intense performance as the tough but hard done by Max. Highly Recommended.</fullReview>

The veteran actors in this film, Edward G. Robinson,(Gino Monetti),"The Red House",'47, gave a great performance as an Italian banker who ran his business the old fashioned way and had the US Government after his accounting books, which he did not have! Richard Conte,(Max Monetti),"The Godfather",'72, stood by his father Gino when his business started to fall a part and his other brothers seemed to just stand around and and throw darts at their own father. Susan Hayward (Irene Bennett),"I'll Cry Tomorrow",'55, gave Max Monetti a hard time and acted like a COLD FISH to his romantic advances. Edward G.

		<fullReview>House of Strangers is directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz and adapted to screenplay by Phillip Yordan from Jerome Weidman's novel I'll Never Go There Any More. It stars Edward G. Robinson, Susan Hayward, Richard Conte, Luther Adler, Paul Valentine and Efrem Zimbalist. Plot finds Robinson as Gino Monetti, an Italian American banker who whilst building up the family business has ostracised three of his four sons. When things go belly up for Gino and the bank, the three sons turn against their father, the other, Max (Conte), stays loyal but finds himself set up for a prison stretch. Untimely since he's started to fall in love with tough cookie Irene Bennett (Hayward).Jerome Weidman's novel has proved to be a popular source for film adaptation, after this 20th Century Fox produced picture came the Western version with Broken Lance in 1954 (Yordan again adapting), and then Circus set for The Big Show in 1961. While its influence can be felt in many other, more notable, crime dramas along the way. The divided clan narrative provides good basis for drama and lets the better actors shine on the screen with such material. Such is the case with House of Strangers, which while hardly shaking the roots of film noir technically, does thematically play out as an engrossing, character rich, melodrama.Propelled by a revenge core peppered with hate motives instead of love; and dabbling in moral ethics et al, Mankiewicz spins it out in flashback structure. The primary focus is on Max and Gino, with both given excellent portrayals by Conte and Robinson. Gino is a driven man, very dismissive towards three of his boys (Adler standing out as Joe) who he finds easy to find fault with. But Max is spared the tough love, Gino admires him and sees him very much as an equal, which naturally irks the other brothers something rotten. This all comes to a head for the final quarter where the pace picks up and the tale comes to its prickly, if not completely satisfactory, ending.In the mix of family strife we have been privy to Max's burgeoning relationship with Irene (Hayward sassy), which positively simmers with sexual tension, or maybe even frustration? This in spite of the fact he is engaged to be married to the homely innocent Maria (Debra Paget). So with dad Gino proving to be, well, something of an ungrateful bastard, and Max cheating on his intended, clearly this is not a film about good old family values coming to the fore! Then there's the small matter of brother betrayal and the case of the foolish decision making process, all elements that keep the viewer hooked till the last. 7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dysfunctional Family.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pretty interesting story, and adult too. Robinson is Pa Minetti, an Italian immigrant, formerly a penurious barber, now the prosperous president of his own bank. He has three older sons -- Luther Adler, Valentine, and Zimbalist. And he favors his youngest son, Max (Richard Conte), who is a lawyer and has his office in Pa's bank.All kind of cozy, like the warm Italian family in The Godfather. But there's a problem. Robinson has brought his old-world ways to the new world. He's not only the president of the bank, but president of the family too, and nobody elected him. Someone calls him "Il Duce." (Kids, that was the title of Benito Mussolini, the Italian dictator in the 1930s and the early 1940s, when his subjects hung him out to dry.) But Pa has, in fact, absorbed some of the ways of the new world, only it's the wrong philosophy. The philosophy can be summarily described as, "Dog Eat Dog." Boy, does Pa browbeat his three older sons, both at work and at home. He has Luther Adler, his first born, working in a teller's cage. Efram Zimbalist, Jr., has some menial position too. And the biggest and strongest, Paul Valentine as Pietro, wears a guard's uniform. He's constantly ordering them to get back to work. And he refers to Valentine as "dumbhead" repeatedly. Even at the weekly family dinners, when the sons bring their families over for Ma's spaghetti dinners, he plays opera on the phonograph -- and LOUD, so nobody can hear anybody else. And Pa makes everyone wait at the table until Conte arrives. "Nobody's eat untilla Max gets ahere." The three elder sons don't care much for the kind of humiliation that Pa is dishing out, though he's rarely mean about it. He just takes it for granted that they know they'll inherit the bank one day when he's gone, and meantime they'll have some notion of what he himself went through, as they crawl on their bellies like dogs and can't afford decent apartments for their wives and kids.How does Conte treat all this? With aplomb. He speaks up for his brothers when they ask him to but he doesn't take it all too seriously. I mean, what the hell, he's a lawyer and Pa's favorite son.A run on the bank (this is 1932) exposes a few weaknesses in Pa's book keeping. He doesn't know the meaning of the word "collateral." He lends money based on his reckoning of whether he'll get it back, accompanied by usurious interest. He keeps money stashed in a cigar box and writes his records on napkins, things like that. So he's brought to trial and is about to be convicted. The older brothers don't care. Pa's just getting what he deserves. But Conte is representing him in court and, seeing the guillotine blade about to fall, interferes with a juror and is sent to prison for seven years. The cops were tipped off by the other brothers, which annoys Conte no end.So when Conte is finally released from jail he intends to take care of them but, due to the seasonal interposition of an adventitious girl friend, Susan Hayward, he decides not to because that would have represented the worst of Pa's desires. A free man, he leaves with Hayward for San Francisco and the brothers get the bank. So long, Pa.Joseph L. Mankievicz directed it efficiently and the script is occasionally very keen. An example of what I mean. Susan Hayward calls Conte and tells him to come to her place; it's a legal emergency. Well, it isn't. She just wants to have some fun with him. He turns her offer down but she says, "Let's go to dinner. I'll get my wrap." Conte walks to the door and opens it, then looks back at her. She drops the wrap on the couch and they stand there silently. Fade out. There's a marvelous scene in a seedy bar. Mankievicz's camera glides along from booth to booth, passing one in which a fat, older man with a cigar is sitting next to a frozen young lady. Neither says a word. A few minutes later, Conte and Hayward look up from their drinks when they hear a slight sob, and there is a cut to the other couple. The girl has covered her face with her hands and the fat man is looking around self consciously. A vignette whose character we can fill in with our imaginations.I said it was an adult movie but that hint of premarital intercourse isn't why. The characters are ambiguous, as people in real life would be. In some ways, for instance, Pa is a lovable old patriarch, but he's also monstrously insensitive to the feelings of others. And the murderous resentment of the older kids is made understandable too. And Richard Conte's character is aggressive and domineering at the beginning, just as a spoiled youngster might be, but he develops into a Mensch by the end of the tale. Hayward develops too, from a whimsical high-end nympho to a woman mature enough to settle for one man, even if he's broke.I don't know why this had to be an Italian family, though. The Italianate elements seem superimposed on the family dynamics, like one of those nude celebrity photos in which the face of the actress or model has been placed on a fake body. Sure, they eat spaghetti and Pa listens to The Barber of Seville. So what? The writers have resorted to stereotypes. I hate stereotypes. Furthermore, no Italian boy has ever been named "Max". They are all named "Tony" and when born are not wrapped in swaddling clothes but dressed in iddy biddy suits of rubbed silk. But that's a small thing in this big, complicated, and largely successful tale of power and jealousy.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson, who in my opinion can be hammy at times, really nailed this role as the controlling Italian patriarch. This is a psychologically straightforward film that is nevertheless satisfying on more than an entertainment level.Conte and Hayward, both fine, have some snappy noirish dialog, and their relationship, like most of what occurs in the plot, is on a visceral emotional level, without any deep explanation except "this is what the heart makes people do." And as the film shows it is often to their own pain.The height of this is what happens to Conte after an act of extreme (though extremely misguided) loyalty to one he loves, which ultimately makes him pay a great price.The production values of this film are very fine; the forward narrative motion of the story held my interest to the very end. And even though there seemed to be a bit of trimming of exposition -- with the introduction of the Hayward character here and there being a bit awkward and lacking explanation and motivation -- there were enough superior moments to raise the film above the ordinary.And Luther Adler's performance as brother "Joe" was fantastic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Just finished watching this terrific film for the third or fourth time and though someone else is credited with the screenplay, Joe Mankiewicz's tart, smart, witty dialog is there in almost every scene. Lubitsch may have had his touch, but when it came to dialog there was no one like Mank.Watch this back to back with ALL ABOUT EVE or A LETTER TO THREE WIVES and you will see what I am talking about.Though I still don't know what truly constitutes a "noir" film, though touted as being one, HOUSE OF STRANGERS seems more like a Greek tragedy than say something in the same style as I WAKE UP SCREAMING. No matter, this is an excellent film, brimming over with Mankiewicz's brilliant pacing and, yes, dialog.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie needed more development. Robinson wasn't menacing enough to provoke such disdain from his sons. Even his wife seems cold to the point of death. Was he that bad? You don't get that impression. Robinson's character was fairly likable, in fact. Susan Hayward is kinda wasted in her part, but she's nice to look at. The movie isn't much in the way of 'film noir'. Not really suspenseful at all, except a little at the end. Not a bad film. It just needed about 15 more minutes of drama, making Robinson's character a bit more believable as a tyrant and more interplay of conflict between Conte's character and his brothers. Maybe a little more of Hayward too.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>House of Strangers (1949)At first this film feels like a forced fit, a good and big idea that was going to stumble over itself. Because there was a brilliant Edward G. Robinson (a Jewish American) playing a terrific old school Italian banker, and there were his four sons, each with something of a developed plot line. It begins in the present, goes back to the start of the various problems between them, then returns to the present. It's complicated in a way, and yet it ends up cohering well. The story holds water, the actors are superb (more on that), and the overall direction and construction (photography and editing) are spot on.So we end up with a very impressive movie, and one that uses worn ideas and makes them fresh enough to last. Robinson is not in the end the main character, but one of the sons is, Max, played by Richard Conte. Now Conte is not to everyone's taste. There's something conceited about him even when he's playing a regular guy. But he's just right for this part of the "good brother" who is also a lawyer and who gets drawn into major mischief by his father's bullheadedness. And Conte is the key to an important other thread to the story (and in some ways the best part), his falling in love with a young and independent Irene Bennett played by Susan Hayward. She isn't just a love interest but she represents an alternative to his family bound, very Italian-American world.Of the other brothers, the eldest played by Luther Adler is the most caustic and believable, giving a stunning performance in just a few scenes throughout the movie. The other brothers are simpler types, and they work, too. In fact, it's only when you drift to the farther reaches of the cast, like the fiancée and her mother, do you find caricatures that strain. In all the dynamic of a group of men adjusting (or not) to the ways of the new worlds is fascinating. Throw in a physically imposing and sharp tongued leading man in Robinson and you can see how much this has going for it.The director is Joseph L. Mankiewicz has a handful of very sensitively made films among the mere twenty in his career (including "All about Eve"), and this is one of his best. He keeps the plot coherent and yet lets it breath. The characters have enough individuality to distinguish themselves without getting us distracted with peripheral stuff. And the camera-work by Milton Krasner is flawless and subtle. This again comes at the slick and yet artful high point in American black and white cinematography, the 1940s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian-American Experience - New York City 1932.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Made during the golden era of Twentieth Century-Fox excellence, this fine film resurfaces on DVD. I'd missed it in 1949 but remember seeing the trailer at the Silver when I was 11, too young to appreciate adult drama.Set in Mulberry Street with on location filming it looks at a family with four adult sons, a house divided against itself, taking the best and the worst of the old ways from a barber shop in Palermo to a bank in New York. There are serious conflicts with the law concerning the old man's handling of the banking business, but this is in no way a Mafia movie. Edward G. Robinson and Richard Conte give solid performances as the old man and his strongest/smartest son. Easy to see why non-Italian Susan Hayward is drawn like a magnet to the handsome, willful Italian (like me) who can ride her out on an emotional roller coaster. There simply are not any serious dramas being made (or planned) in 2005-2007 Hollywood as their focus is entirely on cartoons and silly action heroes. Look in the vaults of yesteryear for the good stuff.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Didn't do it for me</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>First, I should tell you that I like classic movies. That's when they knew how to make 'em. 'Nuff said.Having said that, this one fell short for me. Some interesting twists, but ultimately it felt melodramatic. And there was a lot of telling, instead of showing.The romance with Irene felt forced. The father's negative influence on his sons is much better told in the Godfather.In fact, that's what this felt like - a chick-flick version of The Godfather. Same forces at work, same conflicts, but a much softer ride.I do like Richard Conte - obviously in The Godfather, but he also did a Twlight Zone in which he played a man afraid to go to sleep because he thought his nightmares would kill him. Terrific performance.Susan Hayward never struck me as a very compelling actress. Honestly, it didn't have to be her in this role, could have been almost anybody for me.I love Edward G. Robinson (especially in Double Indemnity), but here he is constrained by the material. He does the best he can with it, and it would have been a lot worse in the hands of another actor.***SPOILERS***One of the things I liked was the setup of the final scene - Joe orders Pietro to pick Max up and carry him upstairs. Joe, Tony, and Pietro (carrying Max) slowly walk up the stairs, while Joe tells us of the lessons he learned from his father. Lessons including finishing a man off while he is down. Fantastic shot, but not enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>***SPOILERS*** By far the most interesting character in the movie about a dysfunctional New York Italian family is older brother Joe Monetti played by Luther Adler who's role was later resurrected some 20 years later in the "Godfather" movies one &amp; two as dark sheep of the Corleone family Fredo Corleone. It's Fredo as the older brother who didn't get respect and was treated like a dummy more or less like Joe was treated by his dad neighbor banker father Gino Monetti, Edward G. "Eddy" Robinson. Then there's also Richard Conte, who was also in the "Godfather", as the smart and pragmatic Max Monetti who like Al Pacino in the "Godfather" movies was the smartest of the Monetti brothers as well had an non Italian girlfriend- Like Al Pacino's Kay Adams in the "Godfather" movies- the Waspy all American girl Irene Bennett, Susan Hayworth, that he threw his Italian hand picked by the family fiancée the much younger and far more prettier Maria Domenico, Debra Paget, under the bus for.It's when Papa Monetti is indited for a number of criminal counts of illegals bank practices it' s Max who sticks his neck out to get him to beat the rap by trying to bribe a number of jurors that, by reporting him to the D.A';s office, backfires on him. Ending up saving a seven year sentence behind bars when during that time his father Gino passed away Max who swore revenge against Joe, for setting him up, is out and ready to bury the hatched with him; As well as check out to San Francisco with his girlfriend Irene. It's now Joe the former lowly $65.00 a week bank teller now bank president who's the big man of the family who still has it in for brother Max and plans to have him murdered to make sure he won't cause him any more trouble in the future.***SPOILERS****Joe uses his two other brothers pretty boy Tony, Efrem Zimbalist Jr, who while Max was behind bars married his ex fiancée Maria as well the brain damaged from taking too may shots in the head in the boxing ring Pietro, Paul Valentine, to do Max in. The final showdown has Pietro beat, under orders from Joe, the living hell out of Max but soon come to his senses. That's when he realizes that what he's doing will not only put him behind bars for life if not in the electric chair but is disrespecting his dead father Gino whom Max took the rap for! Now turning against Joe and about to drop him off a 4th floor baloney Pietro finally realizes just how wrong as well as stupid he is and forgets the whole thing! In the end a battered but still alive and breathing Max rides off into the sunrise with Irene to start a new life with her in far off San Francisco and drop out of the crazy Monetti business ventures altogether!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Monetti and his spaghetti</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Edward G Robinson (Gino Monetti) is head of a bank and a family of four sons, three of whom work for him, but none of whom are shown any respect by him. The only son he seems to value is Richard Conte who has his own legal practice, albeit with dodgy customers. One of his customers is Susan Hayward (Irene) who gets the love interest role.Robinson rules as a dictator. although he does have a funny scene where he compares the old world to the new world, and his business practices come under investigation. As a result of this, Conte tries to protect him but doesn't get very far. The majority of the film is told in flashback, on either side of which we follow Conte as he seeks out his mission of revenge to those who encouraged the downfall of his father.Keep a look out for the best plate of spaghetti ever filmed. Robinson presides over his family every Wednesday evening when they are required to attend a family meal. They take their places around the table, sit in silence and wait for everyone to arrive before they can start to eat while listening to Robinson's opera records at a volume of 3 million decibels. On this particular occasion, they wait for Conte to arrive. It's a strained atmosphere but definitely worth the wait when that pasta shows up.The film gets you involved in a family drama that throws in an un-anticipated end sequence that pushes the story to another level. It's an entertaining film that emphasizes dialogue and drama more than action. All the cast do well with a special mention to oldest brother Luther Adler (Joe). Not sure why Susan Hayward is billed above Richard Conte, though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The film opens with one of those great crowded New York City street scenes that the era was noted for and if you have fond memories of that place and time, this picture will bring you back. I never lived there, nor would I care to, but even as crowded as it appeared here, there still seems to be a nostalgic component to the way the scene came together to evoke a simpler place and time. Very effectively done.Edward G. Robinson has always been a favorite of mine, and it's cool to see him break with the wise guy manner of some of the gangster greats he portrayed in other films. In "House of Strangers" his character is Gino Moretti, patriarch of a dysfunctional banking family who gets pinched for usurious lending practices and other less than honorable schemes at the Monetti Trust and Loan. A decade earlier, Robinson appeared as a boxing promoter in 1937's "Kid Galahad" and it was the first time I saw him exude a peculiar charm speaking in Italian to his mother in the picture. He does it here too, making me wonder if he actually knew the language or just played it well for the role. In any event, he's fairly convincing at it.So even if Robinson's not portraying a gangster here, he's pretty much a gangster at heart in the way he deals with his family. Other than son Max (Richard Conte) who becomes the family lawyer, the remaining three brothers all fall under the thumb of the old man who treats them like menial employees. Personally, I don't know how long I could have put up with 'dumbhead' as a nickname, even if I knew I was going to inherit the family business. One thing I could relate to though was oldest brother Joe's (Luther Adler) salary at sixty five dollars a week. My first boss in the supermarket business was a store manager making sixty dollars a week who asked the owner for a five dollar raise because he needed that much to qualify for a mortgage on his first house! He got it, but he didn't have a Gino Moretti to deal with.Notable performances here by the marvelous Richard Conte who's always a professional, and the icy Susan Hayward who probably could have been toned down a bit to make her more sympathetic as a character. You know, when Max got busted for his attempted tampering of the jury lady, I had a momentary feeling that maybe Irene (Hayward) set him up for the fall. It would have been interesting if the story went in that direction.After all this time I think the story holds up well with good performances all around. The story also injects a number of quick throwaway scenes that say a lot about the characters, like the one where Robinson's character upbraids the bank customer for trying to score 'free ink'. My favorite occurred during the bar scene with Max and Irene, when the bartender came over and dumped the ashtray on the floor. You can't get any more New York attitude than that.</fullReview>

I did initially but then I started to realize that the old father in this was just harder on his sons who weren't as bright and didn't stand up to him. 3 of the sons were just pansies imo. 1 was just not too bright...another was a little wimp...the last one was a little wimp who was conniving until the end. The one trait they all had was they wouldn't speak up. They would just cower when dear ole dad spoke. The only son he respected was a lawyer and stood his ground when his father talked down to him. They respected each other.The premise of this film is a Father, who runs a family bank, treats 3 of his sons not very well. The only son he respects, who runs a bail bonds business inside the bank, is a lawyer and successful ta' boot. Well, the government comes and takes the bank because of unfair business practices. He goes to trial, and in a misguided effort to save his father, tries to bribe a juror and gets caught. 1 of the 3 brothers rats him out and he spends the next 7 years in jail. He gets out and decides what he should do. The film is told in flashback until this point. You won't see the ending coming so I won't say what happens but you can bet...itza goodun'.I sided with the father and the his favorite son in this little drama. This film works all the way through. They build the tension very well right until the end. Grab this one if you get a chance and prepare to take sides.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"House of Strangers" has done me a great service. Richard Conte has always been in my mind as the sadistic husband in "I"ll Cry Tomorrow" - the chap who trips Susan Hayward up so people will think she is drunk, the one who doesn't call her up when he says, so, (he hopes) she will start drinking again. I have seen him in other films but none was able to erase that memory.So seeing him and Susan Hayward in "House of Strangers" as a fiery but decent couple has softened him in my eyes.The story is told in flashback as Max (Richard Conte) goes to the bank, after years in prison, to have revenge on his family. Later at the family home he thinks over past events.Edward G. Robinson plays Gino Monetti a powerful banker whose sons have to do his bidding. Richard Conte plays Max, who is an attorney, instead of following his brothers into the bank. He is also the only son who is treated with respect by the father and the other brothers resent it.He also begins a tempestuous affair with Susan Hayward while his fiancée (Debra Paget) sits meekly by. The father is bought to trial for "cooking the books" and Max goes to jail for 7 years for trying to bribe a member of the jury. From his cell he is inundated with letters from his father filling him with hatred for his brothers.The last 15 minutes are a real shock and brings the film up a few notches. Susan Hayward is her typically fiesty self and does a lot more with the character than is written. Edward G. Robinson over-acts as the larger than life Italian banker.</fullReview>

I like the fact that it is hard to choose a side with the characters as each one has a good point as to what is going on with them in the movie...One thing we are not deprived of is the entire story and then we are left to choose the ending using what we saw as a guide.

		<fullReview>Edward G. Robinson is all wrong as the patriarch of an Italian-American family. He was a marvelous actor -- one of my favorites. And this was not his first Italian. But the pigeon English is so overdone as to be preposterous. The makeup, with a dark mustache, is no help either.True, other (presumably) non-Italians are in similar roles here. But they underplay. Hope Emerson, Debra Paget, and (as one of his sons) Luther Adler are among these.Richard Conte is excellent as the son who appreciates the father's efforts and goes to jail for doing so. But think of Conte, cast slightly against ethnic type, in "Thieves Highway" and his father -- Lee J. Cobb -- there. Cobb does not affect a Vaudeville show Greek accent there and it's a shame that Robinson was directed to here.The story is compelling but it's hard to get past this.Susan Hayward plays Susan Hayward. In early scenes between her and Conte, he seems to be picking up her mannerisms as they spit consonants at each other.The role she plays doesn't seem to me to have much to do with the rest of the story. Using "Thieves Highway" as a comparison again -- and I admit it is somewhat arbitrary to do so -- Valentina Cortese's character is more organic to the plot. Here, the Hayward/Conte romance is more like a separate picture than like a subplot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Few Notes on a Powerful Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie pretty much stands fabled American success stories on their head. Gino Monetti (Robinson) may be a Horatio Alger of the lower-end banking industry, but it's caused him to fail as a father. Except, for son Max (Conte) he bullies and insults his other three sons. In short, he's become a petty tyrant of the first order. The story details how his transgressions play out.All in all, it's a performance powerhouse, though Robinson spreads on the Big personality pretty thick. Conte, however, remains a badly underrated actor who could make you believe whatever his role. Here, it's really he who's central to both the plausibility and the plot. His extended verbal sparring with Hayward, however, suggests a studio build up of two promising performers, even at the expense of pacing. Then too, Paget and Zimbalist get little more than stand-around-and-look-good roles. But what I really like is a neglected aspect of the script. Instead of just making oldest son Joe (Adler) a vicious product of his ruthless dad, a blonde up-scale wife (Douglas) is plotted in. So now Joe's got to prove himself worthy of her and her social registry standing. So how much humiliation can he tolerate as his dad's lowly bank employee. It's a good motivational addition. It's also worth noting that for most of the film, there's really no one to identify with. Max is most promising, but he's a pretty dour personality, not all that likable. And that's probably as it should be, given his background and context.On the whole, ace writer Yordan has fashioned a challenging screenplay that powerfully subverts many Hollywood rags to riches stories, especially among immigrant ethnics. Also, it's likely no accident that the premise is about corrupt banking practices, a logical target of a lefty like Yordan, (later blacklisted). Anyway, director Mankiewicz has fashioned the touchy elements into a compelling 100-minutes that stands up well even among our changing times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An American Italian family drama of an autocratic father of a banking family with four sons against him.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of Joe Mankiewicz' lesser known films (birthday today 11.2) and definitely among his best ones. Edward G. Robinson performs at his best as the Italian father of a banking family with four brothers embroiled with each other, as usual in Mankiewicz's films a brilliant dialogue mesmerize you all through, Susan Hayward also making a splendid performance. Richard Conte plays the one son who acts honourably, while all the others turn against him and betray their father out of necessity to survive ? and let Conte pay for it. When he is freed from prison (which is where the film begins, and we know nothing yet of what has passed), the immediate meeting with his brothers creates the suspense which lasts and constantly grows tighter through the entire film, until the conflict is resolved in the end after many unexpected turns. All actors are at their best, while the lasting impression is made by Conte as a paragon of straight Sicilian nobility, Susan Hayward as a surprising woman of superior character, and above all Edward G. Robinson as the father, who although powerful and successful can't quite follow the new turns of his age. Although autocratic he never becomes unsympathetic, but you rather understand him and have to pity him - he is the tragedy, in a marvellously well-written film script (as all of Joe Mankiewicz' films are) perfectly handled by a masterful director and a set of actors together creating a virtuoso family performance.</fullReview>

It's a complex and multi-layered melodrama, where violence seems to be the only way out. But Conte's character finds an alternative solution, when he strikes up a relationship with a woman played by Susan Hayward. Miss Hayward gives a fascinating performance as the love interest whose own happiness is soon jeopardized by her involvement with this man from a ruthless clan.Hayward and Conte would re-team on screen a few years later in the biopic I'll Cry Tomorrow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Superb movie, superbly done; and one quite underrated at that. The Greek tragedy of a father setting three of his sons against himself while grooming the fourth and youngest as his successor. Now, allow me to say that many reviewers have gotten HOS wrong. This is not a tale of greedy sons robbing their father of his wealth but a gripping drama about child abuse and humiliation. So, let's set the record straight on that. That also concerns the bank.The problem is, people tend to feel so comfortable with some ideas that many times they subconsciously juggle facts to fit them, oblivious many times to clear evidence pointing in some other direction. Ex.: most of us see a bank as a source of wealth and power. That's the way we see them and so it got to be for Joe, Tony &amp; Pietro. Wrong. For these men the bank is simply the bat with which their father hits them for not being like his favorite, Max. When we see them as such, as kids who have been tormented all their lives by a monster of a father, the picture changes and the trio appears instead as victims. Victims who, by a providential strike of luck, are finally given the chance to snatch the instrument of torture from their tormentor's hands and use it to regain the dignity and self-esteem he has taken from them. So there's nothing nefarious about what they did. They deserved what they got and also he. What best proves the point is that there's absolutely no hint that they did it for greed. If you remember the first part, you may recall that their main complaint against Gino was not about money, but about never getting any respect from him. Furthermore, if you take note of the abuse he's constantly pouring on them now, when they are adults, imagine how bad it must have been when they were kids. But Gino's cruelty goes even further as, at the smallest show of discontent he challenges the rebel to go look for a job elsewhere. That's even sadism, as he has deprived them since childhood of the indispensable tools for success and self-reliance in life: dignity &amp; self-esteem. That's why I reject the analogy with Don Corleone, who I don't recall humiliating his kids that way. Gino is far worse than him. An egomaniac to whom the entire world must adapt, obey: relatives, random acquaintances?to whom he may hit in a whim--the judiciary, the government. There's no limit to his ego and those closest to him are the ones suffering the most. All them are his victims, specially his long suffering wife, who evades the unpleasant reality searching for the cause for the general unhappiness in cultural alienation?but who finally does the right thing, giving her sons their due. And where all this leaves Max, Irene?.Max is the one holding the plot together and it's through his memory that the story unfolds. With Max comes Irene. Now, this is an incredibly well constructed psychological drama, which is hinted by what critics say about its ambiguity and shades of gray--things are not as they appear at first--and that's because this is not a story told by a neutral, uninvolved, storyteller but Max's reminiscences of the past, so it is a subjective view of things. What we see here is Max's journey into his own memory and that's what brings all the confusion and why Gino appears at first as an unmethodical, yet sympathetic, banker only to gradually go showing his true colors as Max goes on peeling him layer by layer. The same with Irene, who's introduced as an aggressive, sharp tongued vamp, only to come out at the end as a woman in love; a force for good fighting for his soul against the evil in Gino. But the crucial discovery in Max's journey concerns himself. For the first time he sees who he really was, the man that Gino had made to his own image, his creature, who's shown to him now even in his choice of words--"I'm Max Monetti and nobody talks to me like that". And for the first time he realizes how right were all those trying to rescue him from his father's poisonous influence: Irene, his mother, his brothers. And he realizes too that Gino had no intention of ever giving any power to his brothers in the bank, as he was grooming him to continue with his legacy of hatred and contempt. That's why Max comes converted out of his reminiscence and why he has decided to go away. There's is where Irene plays her crucial role. She not only means redemption to him, but also hope, a new future, the breaking of old chains. Without her he got nothing but loneliness in which case he probably wouldn't have even bothered stopping Pietro from killing Joe, letting the family destroy itself. Maria would have never done that for him; she would have just left him be what Gino wanted, his own clone.Great movie, almost perfectly done. Superb acting by all, Paget with too little to chew. Just one flaw: Max's conversion appears too abrupt. His final words to Gino too casual, almost jovial. It should have all taken more time, more pauses, more thoughtful gesturing. And I don't get why they call this one noir when, apart from the cinematography, there's very little noir here--maybe Max, always with that dark cloud hanging over his head. Also I don't think it has anything to do with any immigrant experience. The Monettis could be any family, in any place on Earth. In all, 8.5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Edward G., with "All His Sons", can't get no respect.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this has nothing to do with the Arthur Miller play "All My Sons" that Edward G. Robinson starred in the film version of, he does play a father of four grown men whose resentment towards their father covers a variety of different reasons. Robinson is an Italian immigrant on New York's lower East Side who makes good as the founder of a bank. He runs his loan division with high interest rates and no collateral, and this makes him subject to an investigation by the Feds. Son Richard Conte, his absolute favorite, is resented by his three older brothers who feel worthless in their father's eyes. Robinsons' old school ideals don't mesh with American values, and some of his ruthless ways fall on each of them, causing impending violence between Conte and the others.This is a modern day Greek tragedy, and features interesting psychological study of each of the main characters. Susan Hayward is the top billed female as a sexy client of Conte's who ends up falling in love with her in spite of the fact that he is engaged to the pretty Diana Douglas. When the chips fall on Robinson because of his illegal banking activities, it is Conte who takes the plunge with them, and the brothers use this as an opportunity to get revenge on dad. Luther Adler, Paul Valentine and Efrem Zimbalist Jr. are the other brothers, and Esther Minciotti (the mother in "Marty") is Robinson's quiet, long-suffering wife who would rather have a simple life back in the old country rather than the rich life Robinson has given her. Right before her Oscar nominated role in "Caged", the large Hope Emerson gives a showy performance as Douglas's domineering Italian mama.The strongest performances are of course by Robinson (using a convincing Sicilian accent) and Conte. Esther Minciotti is amazing in her one strong scene where she unleashes her fury on her sons. The screenplay is powerful (later successfully re-adapted as the Western, "Broken Lance"), and Joseph L. Mankiewicz's direction is masterful. Beautifully filmed with a spooky look at the abandoned house all of the sons were raised in, "House of Strangers" is an absolute must see as a view of how power corrupts and how dynasties fall when they don't stick together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A tyrant falls</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can accept Edward G. Robinson and Luther Adler as Italian, then you can probably go along with this old-fashioned family melodrama about an overbearing banking tycoon and his four grown sons. Robinson steals every scene he is in as the aging bank owner whose unorthodox lending practices eventually get him in dutch with the government. One son, played by Richard Conte, is a lawyer and somewhat immune to his tyrannical father's ways. The other three all work at the bank and live in dad's shadow. A young Susan Hayward plays Conte's love interest. Extremely corny by today's standards, and clearly reflecting the near end of the old Hollywood system, HOUSE nevertheless is watchable for Robinson and his tirades. And his organ grinder mustache and accent.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>You Can Pick Your Friends..But Not A Family of Strangers ****</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an outstanding film with Edward G. Robinson giving a superb performance as an old-lined Italian banker, playing the game for his economic gain at the hardship of others. It takes a depression and subsequent government intervention in banking to bring Gino Minotti (Robinson)Gino had 4 sons played with relish in particular by Richard Conte, as the attorney who attempted to bribe a juror, and Luther Adler, the son who was scorned by his father throughout life and brought unbelievable revenge.Susan Hayward shows that absolute gritty facade as the woman who loved Conte and brought him back to life after prison. Hayward shows that famous swagger walking up to a bar. I thought that in some of the scenes Hayward and Conte were practicing for "I'll Cry Tomorrow," 6 years later.Anyone notice that the ending music was the same theme played 3 years before in "The Razor's Edge?"The picture succeeds because it depicts the differences in immigrant life before and after reaching America. Greed, ambition and hate were never better depicted.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Riveting Drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An immigrant Italian family squabbles over its banking business in 1930s NYC. Robinson is fabulous as the patriarch of the family, who runs a shady business and alienates three of his sons by showing favoritism towards the fourth. Conte is equally good as the favorite son, a no-nonsense attorney. Hayward completes the trio of stellar performances as Conte's tough girlfriend. The script is excellent, with elements of it foreshadowing "The Godfather." Mankiewicz directs with a sure hand. The dialog is sharp and witty, particularly in rapid-fire exchanges between Conte and Hayward. The film also finds time for humor, including a hilarious steam bath scene.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From the 20th Century Fox Film Noir Collection, a very good drama, well written and well acted. Gino Monetti(Edward G. Robinson)is an Italian-American in the 1930s, who rides roughshod over his four grown sons. Gino engages in several illegal activities, albeit unrealized at the time, to build his successful banking business. One son, Max(Richard Conte), staying clear of the business unlike his three brothers. When the government tries to close down the bank because of slipshod loaning practices, Max tries to help in his father's trial only to go to prison for seven years for trying to bribe a juror. While Max is serving time his brothers take the bank away from the elder Monetti. Upon his release Max swears vengeance against his brothers for their actions causing their father's death. Slow in some spots, but an in-depth look at a family that is not really happy. Powerful performances from Conte and Robinson. Also in the cast: Efrem Zimbalist Jr., Luther Adler, Susan Hayward, Paul Valentine and Debra Paget.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic noir drama!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>House of Strangers combines film noir and family drama to brilliant effect, as we follow the decline of the Italian-American Monetti family, who have built themselves upon the bank put together by family head, Gino Monetti. Based on the novel by Jerome Weidman, House of Strangers is a story that features themes of loss, love and betrayal, all of which are wrapped up tightly in an intriguing character study. The plotting is well done, and ace director Joseph L. Mankiewicz manages to keep things ticking over nicely throughout. The story is told mainly through flashback, and we focus on Max Monetti - a man that is consumed with the idea of taking revenge on his three brothers; men who he believes are responsible for the break-up of the family. However, upon looking back honestly at the events leading up the break-up, he soon realises that the main catalyst in the break down was actually the man he was trying to get vengeance for; his father.The main talking point of the film is definitely the leading performance courtesy of the great Edward G. Robinson. Despite the fact that he's not Italian, or American, Robinson delivers an extremely believable performance as the patriarch of the family. You can always count on a good performance from Robinson, and you'll get one here as he leads the film in every scene he's in. Robinson is backed up by supporting performances from the likes of Susan Hayward, Richard Conte and Paul Valentine, who all manage to convince in their respective roles. The plot doesn't contain a lot of real shocks, but by keeping everything running smoothly, the film manages to retain a sense of believability, and the plotting isn't too far removed from a certain seventies classic involving a family of Italians living in America. The cinematography is very bleak, and Mankiewicz adds to this with some great edgy direction, that gives the film that classic film noir feel. Overall, House of Strangers is a major highlight of the film noir and is very much worth seeking out!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the great Hollywood dramas with an absolutely breathtaking cast. Just listing them gives you an idea of what to expect. Edward G. Robinson, Richard Conti, a young Susan Haywood, Luther Adler (should have done more movie work), a very young Ephrem Zimbalist Jr, Debra Paget, and several other great stock players. Superb entertainment. They don't make them like this one anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's directed by Joseph L. Mankiewicz....need I say more?!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joseph L. Mankiewicz had an amazing fun in Hollywood during the late 1940s and into the 50s. Aside from his HUGE misfire later in life ("Cleopatra"), he had an incredible string of successes--one brilliant film after another. Just think about it--he directed "A Letter to Three Wives", "House of Strangers", "No Way Out", "All About Eve" and "People Will Talk" all one after the other! Any one of these films would make a director proud--and yet Mank also wrote these films! Wow."House of Strangers" is unusual for me because I rarely watch a movie more than once (this could explain part of how I've reviewed so many movies). But, because I loved it so much the first time, I thought I'd watch it again. The film was remade only a few years later as "Broken Lance"--also a good film but not in the same league as "House of Strangers". It was also remade only a few years after that as "The Big Show". Obviously, it was an awfully good script.The film begins with one son (Richard Conte) arriving at his huge family home. It seems he'd just completed a stretch in prison. Why he went to prison and what's happened in this family unfolds slowly through the course of the film. I really like this style. Instead of telling a straight sequential narrative, this approach increases the suspense greatly.As for the rest of the cast, the film is filled with some great talents. Edward G. Robinson is at his best as a manipulative and dictatorial family patriarch--and proves he was much more than a one-note actor who played gangsters. Luther Adler, Susan Hayward and even a young Efrem Zimbalist Jr. are on hand to round out the cast. And, although I mentioned him earlier, Conte is great--and it's one of his best roles (along with the highly underrated "Thieves' Highway").The bottom line is like the best of Mankiewicz's films, it's all about PEOPLE and ACTING. You don't watch a Mankiewicz film for spectacle or action (thus the failure of "Cleopatra") but for dynamite acting, great characters and dialog--fantastic, fantastic dialog. For example, watch the scene where Hayward and Conte first meet--it's brilliant and memorable. Also, the ending is just great--very tense and very brutal--sort of like a 'family noir' picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lear On Mulberry Street</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are, of course, as we are constantly reminded by pedants, only seven basic plots and the trick is to apply spin and disguise the original as best you can. For this one Mank - who virtually wrote the entire screenplay without credit - took a handful of pages from Jerome Weidman's I'll Never Go There Anymore and grafted a revised version of King Lear onto them so that instead of a patriarch with three daughters, two of whom despise him and one who loves him, we get a patriarch with four sons, three of whom despise him or, to put it another way, anything Shakespeare can do Mank can do better. Somehow his heart didn't seem to be in it, possibly because he turned out a minor masterpiece, A Letter To Three Wives, back to back with this, nevertheless he supplies Richard Conte and Susan Hayward with some choice Mank-type dialogue and coaxes a masterful performance out of Eddie Robinson as Gino Monetti, banker to the poor. Luther Adler wasn't seen half enough on screen and often when he did get a part he gave the impression, as he does here, that he would rather be in the theatre. This is an interesting rather than memorable example from Mank's first flowering - circa 1946-54.</fullReview>
