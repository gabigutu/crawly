		<fullReview>Well I have to say that this movie is excellent. I was lucky to have my father be in this movie. I grew up in Atlanta,TX and moved from there in 1995. If you ever see the heavy set taxi driver, thats him, the officer at the police station dressed as a woman with the cigar, that was also him. My father did stunt driving and rebuilt the autos in the movie. You will be suprised what I can tell you that went on behind the scenes of the movie. Like when they tied Dawn Wells to the tree, well she was screaming not because of the phantom, but a snake that was on the ground in front of her. The snake came up during the shoot and they didn't tell Dawn about it, she just seen it. That is why her screams are realistic. One scene with the rain, look closey at the windshield wipers, if you notice its fast one minute, then slow, only because the motor went out and my father was on top of the car moving it by hand. Did you also know that most people that played in the movie did not know how to even drive or crank the vehicles? Back then there was push button starts, they kept breaking keys off in the ignition trying to crank it that way, but all the ignition does is unlock the collum. Needless to say they went trough alot of ignition switches. Boy what all I can say and not enough room to do it. I highy recommend this movie to anyone.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Film That Set Up Horror And Crime For Decades</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a true story, the phantom killer stalks Texarkana and kills couples who hang out at lovers lanes. Armed with some nasty weapons and a pillow case for a mask, he terrorizes this town to the point of near shutdown, causing police forces from all over the state to intervene. Who can stop his rampage? I've never seen a film quite like this before. I've seen plenty of based-on-real-killer films (most of which are nothing like the original murders), and the recent David Fincher film "Zodiac" follows very much in the vein of this movie (and Zodiac has some similarities to the Phantom). And this film is a definite inspiration for "Friday the 13th" with the pillow case mask. So, in at least one way, this film really kicked off a trend of stalking psychos. And while the first real serial killer film may have been "Black Christmas", this film isn't one to ignore: there's a really good scene of a woman being chased through the woods that is not unlike what we'd see a hundred times in the next thirty years.The film also offers two dichotomies I'll address briefly: crime versus horror, and comedy versus drama. Much of this comes across as a crime film, because we are following the police on their manhunt and get to know some of the officers personally and they are clearly the protagonists. We want them to win. But this film has a horror element that cannot be ignored -- we don't just see the aftermath of a killing. The director took great delight in showing the chase, the torture and the deaths of the women. A straight crime tale wouldn't do this. But a horror film would, because many horror films have us egging on the killer even when we know he or she is evil. This film offers both sides.The serious and comedy balance is also striking. We have a documentary-style voice telling us the updates and we are offered dates of the killings and for the most part this story remains rather serious and we can sympathize with the town. But then, we also have some cheesy music (not quite "Yakety Sax" but the same idea) and a character who threatens old women, cross-dresses and drives a cop car (poorly) as if he was an officer in "Dukes of Hazzard". Horror films generally have a comic relief -- a dark one -- but this really pushes the silly factor.All the acting is great, the plot is simple but effective (a police manhunt). The video quality isn't perfect (this film really deserves a remastering and a re-appraisal, as horror historians will have to recognize the importance of this single film). But you will like it, I can pretty much guarantee that. I was sucked in almost immediately and lost valuable sleep time, but don't regret a moment of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Another chilling docu-thriller from director Charles B. Pierce (who made The Ledgend of Boggy Creek in 1972), this film being his best!It's 1946, in the small town of Texarkana, Texas-Arkansas a hooded murderer is terrorizing the community and making the local law enforcement desperate.Based upon the real events that surrounded one of America's most baffling serial killers, this solidly made film is a compelling and generally under exposed fore-runner of the slasher genre. Director Pierce gives this film a nicely authentic feel of the era as well as a great atmosphere of dread. The movies strongest scenes are the re-enactments of the murders, which are effectively heart-pounding! Among the memorable moments is a creepy 'murder-by-trombone' and an intense stalking sequence with a bloodied Dawn Wells. Along with these thrilling bits comes some mild comic relief with the local police that thankfully don't hamper the proceedings. The moody music score is also a good touch. The cast does well, veteran actor Ben Johnson is good as a criminal specialist, as is Andrew Prine as a local deputy. Director Pierce himself appears as a bumbling police officer.An entertaining thriller from its shocking opening to its haunting conclusion, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a B movie winner.*** 1/2 out of ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>THE TOWN THE DREADED SUNDOWN is one of the most original horror films of the 70's. And that's saying a lot. It starts off as a square-footed documentary with voice over and all the rest. But in the midst of this rather sweet evocation of Texarkana, Arkansas, a hooded madman runs rampant, sadistically killing and killing and killing. The violence, though not particularly graphic, is disturbing because of the way Pierce places it within his documentary structure. The movie's goal, I think, is to show the unspeakable chaos that lies just beneath the facade of America's post war prosperity. How secure is the picket fence world when a hooded maniac may be lurking in the shadows? The mystery is never solved; we don't find out who the killer is, nor is there a climactic moment where all the action peaks. The killings just stop and the dread never really ends, it just recedes back into the city's shadows. What makes this movie so compelling is the straight forward and uncluttered way Pierce lays out his facts. He will dramatize certain situations, but not in the conventional way, not with a continuous rising and falling melodramatic plot. Pierce's approach circumvents the usual horror movie gestures to zero in on what is, in this case, a purely mythic concern: evil in our midst. The killer, not shown to be a "character" in the traditional sense, is a burlap hood with eyes looking through eye holes and black work boot. The killer's visual presence and violent actions are given no motive, no personality beyond the moments of mayhem we see and the destruction we hear discussed. This killer is merely a faceless force, a depiction of nameless chaos, and, because he exists in this removed state the viewer is instinctually compelled to make sense of his actions. Pierce takes the trappings of exploitation and weaves a creepy and, for me, unforgettable midwestern epic. Charles B. Pierce, an independent producer- director, was the Otto Preminger of the drive-in market. Like Preminger, he was rarely taken seriously as an artist. One reason could be that his film subjects jump all over the place, from horror to Native American stories, to a movie about Vikings staring Cornel Wilde! He thought big and was not afraid to put his name above the title. Even in the post BONNIE AND CLYDE era, the idea that a regional film maker could both embrace and bypass the Hollywood system to actually get films like these made and shown must have seemed strange to most of the status quo. The one that put him on the drive-in map, THE LEGEND OF BOOGY CREEK combines what appears to be genuine documentary footage with horror movie antics. At first, you think it's a joke, but as it goes on, a strange kind of unvarnished beauty emerges. I wouldn't say the movie's entirely successful (TOWN plays with the same concept and is more assured and less loopy), but it's bold and original and it reportedly made a lot of money. I've seen most of Pierce's movies, not all of which work as well as TOWN, but all of them exhibit a splendid sense of place and style. The late 40's vibe in TOWN hits the mark, and on shoestring budget, I'm sure. Charles B. Pierce was a true film maker, and I'll bet there's a lot to be learned by studying his work and the way he put together his productions. Where is he now, and what's he doing?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Women were Crying &amp; Screaming in the Theater!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw this movie when it first came out in Miami, Florida. When the 6feet 8inch. psycho killer wearing a potato-sack as a mask with the eyes cut-out, appears, and butchers the lover-lane couple, with his heavy breathing and the potato sack mask going in and out, a young woman in her 20s ran out of the theater hysterical, and a few other women were screaming! Made a few years before the slasher films of the 1980s, this film was way before its time. The killer was brutal, sadistic, and very realistic. The murders were done in a very realistic manner, and with a cast of almost complete unknowns, it had a documentary feeling to it. Veteran character actor Ben Johnson was excellent as usual, and a nervous looking Andrew Perine did a creditable job, but it was the killer who stole the show. Excellent movie, tame by today's standards, but a horror classic never-the-less.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In the Solid B-Movie Tradition</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The movie reminds me of one of those ace 1940's chillers, like Follow Me Quietly (1949). Based on fact, Sundown is about a phantom killer who stalks lover's lanes in Texarkana, and police efforts to catch him. Of course, without the heavy hand of a '40's Production Code, Sundown is much more graphic than anything from that earlier decade. Importantly, however, this is not a slasher movie. There is some blood and violence, but the chief effect comes from the larger than usual sound department. The screams from victims are both unrelenting and unnerving. The girls really do sound terrified. Then there's the heavy breathing from the hooded killer, which are the only sounds he makes and about as chilling as the screams.Credit producer-director Pierce with making shrewd use of a small budget. The Arkansas locations add both color and authenticity, along with the unforced drawls of southern born leads Johnson and Prine. The movie also does a good job of recreating a '40's milieu, even down to the girls' bobby-sox that brings back fond memories. My only gripe is with Pierce? he should stick to producing-directing because his turn as the inept patrolman Benson is too out of sync and silly for the movie as a whole.Judging from some Google searches, it looks like the screenplay sticks pretty close to the general facts of a case that also appears to have entered the realm of regional folklore. Given the spookiness, I can see why. Anyway, the overall result is a nail-biter in the outstanding tradition of B-movie chillers, with a rather surprising outcome.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very scary, suspenseful film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown is one of my favorite movies of all time. I collect anything I can find on the movie. I own lobby cards, pictures, posters. The movie has comedy, but is also really tense. The movie stars the great actors Ben Johnson and Andrew Prine as determined lawmen trying to stop the phantom. The director and producer of the movie Charles B. Pierce also stars and is very funny as Sparkplug, as he is sometimes called. As I mentioned the movie has comedy such as Sparkplug and others going undercover dressed as women hoping to catch the killer, but believe me the comedy is a welcome relief from the very frightening scenes with the phantom killer, who is one of the scariest killers I've ever seen in a movie. Based on a true story and with Dawn Wells of Gilligans island fame as one of the phantoms victims, you cant go wrong. I highly recommend this great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memorable killer who does not speak ....................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ben Johnson leads a Texarkana manhunt for a hooded serial killer. Aproximately every three weeks in 1946, random killings occurred, mostly in lovers lanes. The film has excellent post WW2 atmosphere, and is only weakened by voice overs, and some"Barney Fife" type humor that fails completely. The attacks are sometimes depicted rather darkly, but the hooded killer who does not speak, is memorable. One does sense a feeling of dread among the townsfolk throughout, and the police frustration is also well documented. Sometimes less is best, as is the case with "The Town That Dreaded Sundown". With no idea of who the masked menace is, his motivation, or as the open ended conclusion speculates, is he still out there, ones imagination is left to wonder. - MERK</fullReview>

The writers and directors of this movie did a good job on it , i remember most of it , and at one point i was afraid that he or she would come to the town where i lived at the time and do the same thing. the thought that someone in this town did this and could still be alive is scary and i pray to god the train killed him. good job to the directors for doing such a good job on this film because it has still affected me 30 some years later, so i would say that it had a lasting and terrifying effect on me. please remake this film the exact way you made the first one and put it on at the movies and on DVD. it will be a good seller and scare the crap out of anyone who watches it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Well made, sometimes effective horror film that is based on a true story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Set in the late 1940's Texarkana, Arkanasas. The residents of a small peaceful town are terrorized by a mysterious hooded killer. Who's been stalking and killing random victims during the night. When the police from the town are hopeless and confused by the terror. A professional detective from Texas, Captain J.D. Morales (Oscar-Winner:Ben Johnson) arrives in Texarkana to help the police office. Who is also charged in the case is Deputy Norman Ramsey (Andrew Prine). Although these vicious, then unusual crimes stopped as quickly as they begin. Morales and Ramsey are running out of time.Directed by the late Charles B. Pierce (Bootleggers, The Evictors, The Legend of Boggy Creek) made an well made horror film that is occasionally scary and suspenseful. This sometimes, unusual movie is also narrated by the late Vern Stierman. Which is surprisingly effective, when it is used. Pierce himself appears in a supporting role as Patrolman A.C. Benson. Who is the comic relief of the movie but that's the only complain of the movie. Sometimes, i felt the film's sense of humour sometimes hurts the effectiveness.Since the movie is only available in a bootleg release. You can find this movie in Full Screen or Widescreen. You are better off finding this in Widescreen. Since it is extremely well shot by James W. Roberson in Panavision. The movie is also gimmicky at times, especially during the conclusion. Since this picture has become an Cult Classic over the years. Now...There's an remake in the works and it might be shot in 3-D! If you haven't seen this, this is worth seeing. The look of the hooded killer is giving homage later in "Friday the 13th Part 2". The killer in this movie, who is truly scary is played by stuntman Bud Davis as the Phantom Killer.

		<shortDescription>Very spooky based-on-fact thriller.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Done partly in a documentary style, with a narrator (Vern Stierman) on hand to explain characters and events to us, "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is the memorable telling of a real life murder spree that occurred in the Texas / Arkansas border town Texarkana in the post-WWII mid-1940s. The hooded killer (played here for maximum creepiness by stuntman Bud Davis) claimed a handful of victims and in fact was never caught, much less identified. That lends a certain lasting impact to this film.Directed by Charles B. Pierce ("The Legend of Boggy Creek"), "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" gets off to an appropriately scary start as our killer wastes little time getting down to business. His scenes are as good as those in any horror film, especially one truly bizarre scene where he uses a trombone to kill a girl. He doesn't use the same killing method every time, displaying a definite twisted imagination. His heavy breathing is truly unnerving.Things alternate between the killers' actions and the intense manhunt that the local law enforcement puts into effect. The cops, hard pressed to discover clues or any useful information, call in a bigshot Texas Ranger named J.D. Morales (Ben Johnson). Morales most frequently is partnered with hard working deputy Norman Ramsey (Andrew Prine). An element of comedy is introduced into some scenes, especially in those involving the bumbling deputy "Sparkplug" Benson, played by director Pierce; at one point, several cops dress in drag and play the female half of various "couples" intended to serve as bait for the killer. These scenes do stick out a lot but thankfully never go on too long.Johnsons' calm, authoritative presence is a big asset to this film, as is the solid performance by the under-rated Prine and the flavour supplied by the supporting cast. Jaime Mendoza- Navas' music score is excellent, as is the cinematography by James W. Roberson. The violent bits pack an effective punch and the resolution is nothing short of chilling; updates on the characters are given before the end credits start rolling.Screenwriter Earl E. Smith appears on screen as Dr. Kress.Highly recommended to any film lover fascinated with true crime stories.Eight out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Texarkana, circa 1946, a hooded psychopath selectively victimized and killed couples primarily in isolated, rural Lover's Lane spots, using a lead pipe to bludgeon, as well as, a gun, with a silencer, to commit cold-blooded, execution style murders, done with a sense of menace you can feel underneath his mask, his heavy breathing and mad eyes considerably conveying the sadistic intent for those he targets. I have seen my share of brutal slashers, but The Town That Dreaded Sundown, not overtly gory, depends on the presence of the killer on screen, the terror of those he pursues, and the style for which he murders them for the effect. Sure a director like Rob Zombie can make a film where a killer stabs someone 40 times, but there is just something more potent and unsettling when you see the hooded menace of this film, strapping a knife to a trombone, the idea just coming to him out of the blue, shortly after tying up the band playing female victim to a tree, and blowing into the mouthpiece as the blade hits the mark, not explicitly displaying the actual violence, just the reaction of the assault on the face as each strike penetrates flesh. This is one of the strongest scenes in the film because the couple who is killed almost drive away from the secluded, remote spot, an area that had been patrolled, with the young man driving the vehicle jerked from the car, pummeled by the killer, hit across the head, subdued but trying to get to his feet while the teenage girl is tied to the tree, shot multiple times while attempting to gather his bearings. The girl watches as the killer quietly pulls the pistol, aiming cautiously so he can hit the target, and pumping several bullets into the poor victim. This scene to me, while not explicitly gory, gets the job done just as well as the psychopath in Fulci's New York Ripper, taking a razor down a female victim. It is always about the execution (to pardon a pun) of the scene that I think gets across the point and director Pierce, I believe, excels at depicting just how dangerous the hooded killer is. The first murder is handled a bit differently, more subtly, but preparing us for what is to come. A couple are mercilessly attacked, the male pulled out of the windshield, with the killer entering the car to finish off the girl. The female survivor is found crawling helplessly on the side of a highway, and the film tells us that carnage awaits future locals who have the misfortune of living in Texarkana. Using a narrative to explain the era and certain details of the time period, Pierce adopts an approach similar to The Legend of Boggy Creek, successfully evocating 1946 Texarkana splendidly. He incorporates moments of humor into the film so it won't be a total drag, and has some great actors to communicate to us the frustration and intensity of searching for a killer, crime scenes yielding no evidence, only minuscule assistance from eye witness accounts that give little to go on. Reliable screen veteran Ben Johnson is celebrated Texas Ranger hired to lead the investigation with the great B-movie actor Andrew Prine (who has the uncanny ability/knack to portray both heroes and villains) as Deputy Sheriff assigned to assist him in the manhunt. Several dead ends and false claims (by those saying they are the killer just for the spotlight) only further hinder and add difficulty to this investigation. The open ending is really an effective way to conclude the picture and the setting triggers the experience of Boggy Creek all over again, the Bigfoot replaced by a hooded psycho. Probably Charles B Pierce's best film, The Town That Dreaded Sundown does predate the slasher cycle of the 80s and very well could have been one of the inspirations for potato-sack killer Jason Voorhies in Friday the 13th Part II. I think the best scene could be the killer, becoming even more daring, shooting a man laid back comfortably in his easy chair, in his living room, while the wife is in her bedroom getting ready. The woman, played by Dawn Wells (really good in this one protracted sequence which allows Pierce to wring as much suspense from the situation as possible, and doing so well, I thought...), is also shot in the face, flees her homes, through the woods, and into a nearby neighborhood, with the killer following closely behind. Finding a pick axe, the killer has grisly plans for her, but will Dawn be able to get help?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horror and crime, for once, work hand in hand</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown achieves at a style of horror filmmaking films of the same genre don't even consider anymore; documentarian style. I'm not talking low budget, shaky camera. I'm talking haunting narration, no name casts, a well developed story, and the perfect mixture of murders as well as crime-drama.This all feels like an episode of CSI, only better, more developed, and more entertaining. The film is based off the real murders that occurred in the mid-forties in Texarkana, Arkansas. The killer wore a white sheet with two little holes for eyes. He was dubbed "The Phantom Killer" and went on to kill five people and attack three of them. To this day, he has never been caught. Being that the film dates back to 1976, it states that "today, he still lurks the streets of Texarkana, Arkansas." Obviously, in 2012, he's most likely long-gone dead. Or is he? The age of the killer in the film, like in the real life case, are very unclear. He is seen to be a very tall man, modestly built, and casually dressed, despite the mask. Never do we see anything we could identify in a police lineup. It's as vague and as ordinary as the man in the real life case.The film also packs in some excellent, chilling narrations from Vern Stierman, a popular voice in film. His narration is a main contribution to why the film plays like a documentary. The way he narrates the events, announces the character's occupations, etc doesn't feel like a lazy way at character development as much as it feels like a well conducted docudrama.In the suspense field, the film is pursued with knowledge, surreality, and success. We get the dark, eerie atmosphere of the setting in the mid hours of the night, combined with some fantastic chords in the music. The chords don't serve as much as a jump scare that makes you laugh at yourself for becoming bait, but it offers substance and a murder to go along with it. It's not simple trickery like we're so used to.I normally don't like when films try to do one too many things. This one tries to do two things and is successful at both; be a horror film as well as a crime-drama. Since the film is going for more of a docudrama atmosphere, both feel well developed and fitting, rather than the film immediately changing what it is trying to be halfway through. It's not a movie that had ambition to be a horror film, but then got sidetracked in the second or third act.The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a creepy horror film and an effective crime-drama, never feeling like it is insisting upon itself on either level. When you think about it, how many horror films succeed at pulling off two genres that don't totally go hand in hand? Only one comes to mind instantly.Starring: Ben Johnson, Andrew Prine, and Dawn Wells. Charles B. Pierce.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was incredibly bad. It was literally an insufferably amateurish attempt at lurid, psycho-sexploitation cinema. For 1976, it was so anachronistic that it had the feel of a 50s B-movie. It featured Ben Johnson in a wooden role and the character of a local bumbling deputy, who was supposed to be comic relief, but his buffoonery was inserted so awkwardly that it simply added more pitiful misery to the town's overall effort. A truly horrible film...yet somehow, like a train wreck, I couldn't seem to stop watching as I prepared for the next ridiculous encounter with an inept, helpless screaming prom queen. Afterthought: where were all the guns? Texarkana...and no one had a gun until 4/5ths of the film was done?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown has gotten the reputation of a cult classic over the years as a creepy slasher movie that anchored its roots in realism based on a real case. Add a creepy killer and the authenticity of the small town feel made this a very popular film among horror circles. As for me, I do like the film, but it is not the cult classic people build it up as in the first place.Good:I really like the direction since it does approach the movie in a quiet manner that emphasizes the feel of the small town. I liked the creepy atmosphere it generates due to the chaos from this killer and you can feel it. The stalk/kill scenes involving the killer are also well done with the creep factor especially with the actor who plays the killer who really pulls it off.Bad: However, there are many things that drag this movie down from being truly great. The main problem is the forced comedy inserted here. For a movie that relies on mood and creep factor, it loves to insert wacky comedy straight out of a slapstick comedy. It doesn't work and it is very jarring to the point of lessening the effect of the killer's scenes. The acting is also not that good in points with some moments being very bad. There's also a bad day for night sequence that didn't even try to cover the fact that it was filmed in the daytime which is confusing because there are other scenes that are clearly filmed at night.Overall, while I do appreciate the documentary feel of the movie and the stalking scenes work, the forced comedy and bad acting drag this movie down for me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slowly builds tension and then explodes on you</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is based on a true story that occurred in 1946. Famed Texas Ranger J.D. Morales is called into Texarkana by Deputy Norman Ramsey after one young couple are beaten and tortured and another murdered on back county roads. Ramsey and Morales both suspect the incidents are tied together. They combine the forces of the local police and the Texas Rangers to catch the "Phantom Killer" before he can strike again.I've found a new favorite director in Charles B. Pierce. He is the perfect example of a filmmaker who doesn't need to lean on graphic imagery and gore to get a viewer's blood pumping. He is a believer in the "less is more" school of thought and it works perfectly for him. Pierce slowly builds tension and then lets it explode on you at the last minute. You know something dreadful is coming but are still creeped out about it when it finally arrives.Although "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" isn't completely a true story, all you have to do is a little investigating to know there's still quite a bit of validity in what happens on screen. I think that's what makes the film even more frightening. The thought that real people went through these ordeals in some form or another. I also found it interesting that besides some bad language, "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" was rather clean for this type of movie. There wasn't any nudity to be seen. I was wondering why this was until I read that director Pierce was a Baptist. A scene in "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" featuring a preacher praying at a school dance suddenly made perfect sense to me as well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Half of this film is done like a creepy documentary with a "serious guy voice over" and killing reenactments which are utterly brutal, nasty, misogynistic, and very very suspenseful. That half of the movie I would give ten stars. However the other half which follows a bunch of dumb cops with silly, out of place comedic shenanigans, complete with silly out of place comedic music to boot is an awful eye- and ear-sore! But, oh those killing scenes!!! You've got a guy who looks just like Jason from Friday the 13th Part 2 killing, biting, torturing couples but unlike F13 the the camera lingers on the attacks. He doesn't just pop out, stab someone and disappear, we get to see the whole nasty affair! Then its back to "Barney Fife" and the bumbling cops charade. Blechhh! Cool ominous ending though. Any horror movie fan should definitely check it out!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Definitely glad I finally got around to seeing this, 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown' holds up against the rest of the 70's and 80's horror schlock. The movie is actually pretty violent for it's time, and was probably pretty unnerving to audiences who viewed it in 1976. The film moves along at a nice pace, has a nice sense of comedic relief that isn't often seen in the horror genre, has it's moments of suspense, and it all goes over nicely.It has hints of Charles B. Pierce's other work, 'The Legend Of Boggy Creek', and reminds me of being the 70's version of 'Zodiac', which it was obviously an inspiration for, mixed with 'The Texas Chainsaw Massacre'. The film is by no means perfect, and it can come off as kind of campy at times, but all in all, it is a very well-made horror film, and should be essential viewing for the avid horror fan. THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN ----- 7/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An accidental slasher?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two years before this film, the granddaddy of your typical slasher film, Black Christmas, was released. But it wasn't until Carpenter's "Halloween" that triggered the whole thing in the 1980's.This film although not considered a slasher, does contain the elements of one. A masked murderer killing teens in sometimes bizarre ways, like attaching a knife to the end of a trombone and playing it while trying to stab somebody with it.Based on real life events, the movie is set in 1946 in the city of Texarkana, Texas, and plays as a Docu-thriller the doings of "The Phantom Killer", a figure wearing a white mask over his head with holes cut out for his eyes(remind you of anyone?) who left the city of Texarkana in constant fear, or better yet, left the whole city dreading sundown.The acting is pretty average, if not below average, sometime it may seem like Ben Johnson and Andrew Prine are carrying the burden of acting all by themselves.The film does not feel like it's set in the 1940s, it seems like the director only decided to throw a couple of old Buicks here and there and call it 1946. Probably a budget thing.It also unfortunately attempts at comedy in which it fails terribly.These things however, do not interfere with the fun ride the film is.Charles B. Pierce's "The Town that Dreaded Sundown", IS a classic and should be seen by everyone interested in the slasher genre.7/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Campiness at its finest.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is in some desperate need of restoration and an official DVD release, for that matter. The dated film reel is too dark during most of the scenes I wanted to see most, which is just about every scene with The Phantom Killer since most of his kills take place at night. I feel it hurts the film more than anything. If it was just grainy throughout the film, then it'd kind of add to the general feel of the movie. The film is not only grainy, but the colors also bleed into each other, lighting is off in some scenes, some scenes have terrible audio quality, and some scenes wind up being too dark to see what's going on. I understand that the film was a bit low budget and it's basically a B-grade horror film, but restoration would help in some aspect.Getting back to the B-grade horror film point, the film definitely lives up to that moniker. The acting is pretty bad, for the most part. Ben Johnson and Andrew Prine are pretty much as good as you're going to get in the cast as Captain J.D. Morales and Deputy Norman Ramsey. Everyone else is pretty much what you'd expect in a film like this. The silly attempts at humor really hurt the film more than anything. I mean, do you really want to see Patrolman A.C. "Spark Plug" Benson dress up in drag and basically get felt up by a fellow officer? Or cop cars running around in circles when they're in the middle of a high speed chase? Seriously, all that was missing was the Benny Hill music. Spark Plug is pretty much the comedy relief of the film and, in my opinion, just doesn't really need to be there to begin with.While the film does have its drawbacks, what is done right is done fairly well. Some of the killings are pretty creative. The trombone kill is probably the scene that'll be the one anyone brings up first when this film comes up in conversation. The opening kill scene is the one I was referencing about being too dark at times, but what you can make out is pretty intense. The darkness puts the viewer a bit more on edge as you don't really know where the killer is going to pop up next or what he's going to do to his victims. Speaking of the victims, most of them do a really good job of acting terrified. It seems so genuine at times. I also liked The Phantom Killer. When someone with a mask over his face is generally able to express emotion somehow through body movements or body language, I find that pretty impressive. The breathing heavily through the sack over his face was a bit over the top on one hand, but really added to the character on the other.I guess my biggest gripe with the film is that I wanted more of The Phantom Killer and less of the cops rounding up the troops and acting silly. It just left me wanting more. With a film that's based on true events around a killer that was never caught and the murders never fully solved, the open ended finale doesn't help a whole lot either.The Town That Dreaded Sundown could be considered a hidden gem to many people. Despite the fact it was silly, over the top at times, and was basically a part of the films that sparked the slasher horror film genre(which could be good or bad depending on what your opinion on slashers is), I still enjoyed it and recommend hunting it down. Yes, it's a B-grade horror film, but the horror that's in this film is worth seeing and is the highlight of the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The one that got away.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Proving that it's the totality of a person's work that should rightfully categorize whether someone has a talent for directing, The Town That Dreaded Sundown proves that there is more to Charles B. Pierce than his more well known albatross Beast of Boggy Creek II and to a lesser extent The Norseman. Centered in Texarkana, Texas in 1946 a series of assaults and murders by a man wearing a sack over his face turns the friendly town into a community that quickly becomes scared of it's own shadow. Ben Johnson as Captain J.D. Morales is called in to assist Texarkana Deputy Norman Ramsey in one of Andrew Prine's finest performances ever. Charles B. Pierce supplies the movie's comic relief as lead-footed hothead A.C. "Sparkplug" Benson that provides genuine bright spots in an otherwise dark movie. What makes this such an interesting story is that the case remains unsolved to this day as apposed to all the connect the dots maniacal killer movies that flood the market. There is no happy ending and sometimes the bad guy does win, just like in real life. A very underrated movie that isn't too long and yet pulls you as the storyline progresses. How many films do you know that have an attempted murder of Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island fame? Just one my man, just one. Well done Charles, I knew you had it inya!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A rather good and creepy slasher from the 1970's.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was made in the 70's and is based off events of a 1940's night in a small town. This town was the location of a small, but I am sure no less scary murder spree. Five victims killed, others injured, and the only thing known about the killer to this day is that he wore a hood. Makes sense this occurred in the 40's as I can see someone doing this and virtually disappearing and getting away with something like that back then, especially in a small town. The murders are not very graphic or anything, but it still works quite well, in fact better than most slashers of the 1980's which is usually considered the decade of the slasher movie. The story is interesting and the fact that these crimes actually happened add to the eeriness of the film...that and the fact the guy never got caught. The movie is a bit limited thanks to the fact it is based off true events, but the filmmakers do a good job in presenting the story in a way that keeps you guessing and on the edge of your seat. Most of my complaints stem from the ending which can not be helped as you never see the killer...this complaint is only minor as the fact the killer is never revealed also adds to the creepiness to the film. It also makes one glad this event took place so long ago so the killer in all likelihood is dead now. I am sure this movie is probably rather hard to find now, if found though it makes a nice addition to a horror library. I only saw it once myself as a child and I still remember it rather vividly, one of those old mom and pop rental store gems you luckily stumble upon.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic little small town psycho horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen this a couple of times now and really enjoy it. The first time I was right on the edge of sleep throughout, in fact I think I even drifted in and out a little, but despite not being fully clued in on the action I found the film to be pretty much totally gripping. I watched it again recently, with the benefit of being more awake and I gotta say, this is pretty awesome stuff. From the get go it has a nicely authentic rural period feel and a neat documentary style edge given by the folksy, compelling narration of Vern Stierman. It doesn't take long before getting to the meat of the film, which is a series of brutal murders committed by a terrifying hooded maniac. Though lacking much in the way of actual blood or gore, every scene with this imposing fiend (played to the menacing hilt by Bud Davis) is a nail biting delight and he kills with such a mean spirited passion that it wholly makes up for the lack of detailed grisliness. Trying to catch this evildoer is the police force of Texarkana, helped out by elite lawman J.D. Morales, played in gruffly sympathetic fashion by veteran Ben Jonson. The great Andrew Prine, plays the other lead in inspired fashion, giving the same committed and keen ability that he brought to classic hippy witchcraft classic Simon, King Of The Witches. There's comic relief too, courtesy of director Charles B. Pierce playing the enthusiastic but witless Sparkplug Benson. This is really something of a classic, the killer is one of the greats of the genre and his choice of garb bears interesting resemblance to Jason Vorhees in his pre hockey mask period. He also comes up with one choice of weapon so twistedly inspired that its hard to believe it hasn't been ripped off in any later films. Its interesting to see a film where local police and outsiders collaborate without friction, as opposed to the usual cliché and also to see a generally sympathetic portrayal of law enforcement. Pretty much the only criticism I have of this is that the comedy is at times too broad and the structure of the film is very simple, where I would have enjoyed a little more character insight or delving into small town life. This aside, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is, in my opinion, a real gem of a film and I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In many ways this is an impressive, compelling and absorbing film that has a creepy and unsettling atmosphere all of its own. The fact that it is based upon a true story serves to add further disquiet to the series of events that unfold on screen. The scenes involving the unknown serial killer are extremely well done, and definitely leave the viewer with an uneasy feeling. In fact, the whole film has a disturbing quality with an undercurrent of menace, which is very effective indeed, and does make the film stand out from many similar efforts. However, the thing that lets the film down badly is the totally unnecessary shafts of buffoonery involving an incompetent police officer. They simply do not sit right with the rest of the film, and are completely out of place. That criticism aside, the film is well worth seeking out, and special mention should be given to Ben Johnson &amp; Andrew Prine for their portrayal of the central characters. A recommended treat for fans of creepy movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the true story of the Texarkana Moonlight Murders, this follows the case closely as a Sheriff's Deputy (Andrew Prine) and Texas Ranger (Ben Johnson) try to catch the killer dubbed The Phantom. The film does take a few liberties in order to be more cinematic (Prine narrowly missing the killer; the heroic duo confronting the killer on a railway line) but holds true to the fact that the killer was never caught. What really sets this apart is the amount of period detail that - coupled with the voice of a narrator - almost makes it seem like a documentary. The only down side is some forced comedy involving the bad driving habits of a Barny Fife-like deputy (oddly enough played by the film's director Charles B. Pierce). The film is begging for a widescreen release.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A town on the border of Texas and Arkansas is terrorized by a vicious masked killer following WWII. A movie based on a true case in the town of Texarkana.I had high hopes for this movie, having seen another Charles B. Pierce film, The Legend of Boggy Creek and having enjoyed that one. I was very disappointed. The acting was uninspired, the story did not draw me in, and felt no attachment to any of the characters. I really wanted to like this movie. I did. I have a thing for horror movies from the time period of the 40s through the early 80s, and one about a very obscure serial killer (I had never heard of this still unsolved case until I watched the movie, which in turn caused me to google the real case).Anyways, I just found it very boring. The actors were uninspired, and oh my god I've never heard more annoying screaming in any horror movie I've ever watched ever. I ended up leaving it on as background noise while I did something else.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Decent Effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie claims to be based on actual events, and the reading I've done on the case seems to suggest that - except for the ending and some extraneous comedy material focusing around a bumbling, Barney Fife-like local cop (which seemed totally out of place) - it's relatively true to the events that actually occurred in Texarkana in the spring and summer of 1946.One night, a young couple is parked on "Lovers Lane" when they're suddenly attacked by a violent, masked man. Both survive the attack, but this is the beginning of a season of terror in Texarkana which eventually leaves five people dead and the murderer unidentified. All five murders (and the original two attacks) are portrayed (not graphically, but clearly) and the setting of a wooded, swampy area late at night makes this a truly frightening movie at times.The movie is pushed along by the use of narration, which filled in some details. The characters (except for the comedy cop named Benson) came across as realistically portrayed, although their names were changed. Some of the more graphic details from the real cases (especially the parts dealing with sexual assault) were left out. The record would seem to suggest that "Morales" - the Texas Ranger assigned to head up the investigation and whose real name was Gonzaullas - was not as warmly received by the local officials as the movie depicts. The biggest alteration from the facts seems to be the ending of the movie. Here, police find and chase a masked suspect into the swamp but never catch him, and the movie speculates that he may have died in the swamp. In truth, there was an arrest made in the case, but there was never a conviction, although many people believe that the man arrested was in truth the killer. Overall, this is a decent movie - better than I was anticipating to be honest. It would seem to have had some impact on the "Friday the 13th" series - the mask the killer wore being very similar to the mask that villain Jason Voorhees wears in the first installment of that series. The performances here are pretty good, although the cast isn't exceptionally well known - the most familiar name and face is probably that of Dawn Wells (who played Mary Anne on "Gilligan's Island.") Apparently this isn't an easy movie to find - but it's worth taking advantage of the opportunity to see it if it should pop up somewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The movie we dreaded would be released</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is based on a true story about the brutal murders of some people in a small Arkansas town in 1946. Unfortunately, and much to the chagrin of the fine people of this community, it is also about the police force investigating the murders. The cops are portrayed as mostly idiots who make Barney Fife look like a top cop.A killer wearing a cloth sack over his head stalks mostly teenagers in a lovers lane area and murders them. This in itself could have been the basis of an interesting thriller. But the filmmakers chose to play with the facts of the case and tried adding unneeded comic relief. Even the facts of the murders themselves have been changed in some cases. That would explain one absolutely ridiculous scene in which a woman is tied to a tree and the killer happens to find a trombone and ties a knife to the end of it and mimics playing it as he thrusts the knife into her.Ben Johnson adds a touch of respectability to the proceedings as a Texas ranger called in to solve the killings. His adequate performance stands out in a movie filled with lousy performances.As for the killer himself, he is menacing for a few moments wearing the cloth hood chasing the helpless teenagers. Those few moments are the most effective in the movie. But every time he breaths the hood moves in and out making him look ridiculous. Apparently the real killer had a hole for his mouth. Here the filmmakers choose only to give him holes in the eyes. It ruins the desired effect.** SPOILER WARNING ** For those that care enough to watch this junk and don't want anything spoiled I suggest skipping this section. The killer was never caught. In real life investigators believe they knew who the killer was but couldn't charge him because his wife seemed to be the only one with damaging evidence against him. But in the film he simply gets away (in a ridiculous chase scene). His motives were never known. Perhaps the filmmakers should have tried to invent something to give the audience a decent explanation.Or better yet, perhaps the filmmakers should have left the whole thing alone and moved on to another bad movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have always maintained that things that could or have actually happened are far scarier (than say space aliens, the undead, Jason etc ). THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN , therefore had a terrific basis for a movie. A series of murders, largely perpetrated on isolated couples on lovers lanes occurred in the town of Texarkana right after WWII. The killer was never caught. Great premise for a thriller ! Unfortunately, the budget, screenplay, and most of the acting is far from worthy. ANDREW PRINE, DAWN WELLS do fairly well with the little they have to work with. BEN JOHNSON, on the other hand, come off like he is royalty visiting The House of Commons. The whole production has the feel of one of the old IN SEARCH OF episodes with LEONARD NIMOY. Aside from the actors mentioned previously, the rest of the cast appears to have been locals with no acting ability, let alone projection. The movie is scary at times, dull at others. Lackluster would be a good word to describe it. What could have been a very scary motion picture disappoints !</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spooky and atmospheric to its core, the town that dreaded sundown is an interesting little journey into a real life murder story. In the film, a masked killer stalks the populace of an idyllic Texarkana town, with a man hunt close behind. With out a doubt, the murderer is the most interesting and creepy character in the film. His simple yet terrifying hood is very spooky and imposing. During his scenes, the tension is often very thick, and the action is executed well. Less, however can be said for his pursuers, the police. With bumbling antics reminiscent of Barney Fife, they often ruin the atmosphere with their forced comic relief. This of course, takes away a great deal from the film. in fact, if they had made the police serious and on topic, then the town that dreaded sundown could have been a classic in te crime genre. Still, I can definitely recommend the film for the killer's scenes alone. They are creepy, atmospheric, and unsettling. I can give this film a solid 6.5/10, and say that this film certainly deserves a cult following.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>With hindsight and oodles of carbon-copy slasher films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, director Charles B. Pierce ('The Legend of Boggy Creek' / 'The Winds of Autumn'), well before 'Halloween' or 'Friday the 13th, single-handedly invented the silent-killer-in-a-mask genre that has saturated horror ever since. What's more, he did it with style. There are chunks of this film that could easily have been directed by a young, idealistic Steven Spielberg with an every-man police officer as the lead and an almost-folksy narration elevating the town of Texarkana to sympathetic heights.In the mid-1940's, the city of Texarkana (which straddles the Texas/Arkansas border) was the location of one of America's first serial killer cases. 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown' is a very loose interpretation of the (so dubbed) 'Phantom Killer's' exploits and the Police, Texas Ranger, and FBI investigations that followed him over the course of a year. The famous bag mask (that was later recycled for Jason Voorhees' first appearance in 'Friday the 13th Part 2') was a liberty taken by the director - a liberty taken with great success. Also a construct of creative freedom are the murder scenes in this film (which are violently terrifying and extremely graphic for any era). A good example of this skewing of truth is a death ? and I won't go into detail ? involving a rather creative attempt at playing the trombone. There was a saxophone in evidence with one of the real murders but the gruesome fiction that Pierce comes up with has to have scarred many young minds over the last 37 years (mine included).With hindsight and oodles of carbon-copy slasher films stored away in our collective psyches, the plot comes across as being pretty basic for the genre but it's actually a very human film. There are genuine characters and a bizarre sense of humor that fluctuates between hideously dark and downright goofy. From scene to scene, the tone changes are so jarring that I wouldn't hesitate to believe that there were multiple directors involved. It feels a bit like a nightmare baby spawned by John Huston, John Carpenter, and 'The Dukes of Hazard'. How can you possibly not enjoy such a monstrous birth!?</fullReview>

I'll say no more - get hold of a copy and see for yourself.For me, well written, highly underrated and a classic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It was referenced in "Scream" and it should be, this is probably one of the creepiest slasher films I've seen in years. Despite a ridiculous murder scene involving a trumpet, this is really spooky and is somewhat fact based. The title alone spews dread and foreboding possibilities, and the film delivers with tension, atmosphere and does what many slasher films can never pull off: it makes night terrifying. Good flick to watch alone, it'll scare the crap outta ya.(*** out of ****)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is one of those mid-70's movies that featured an aging star in the lead role surrounded by lesser names. Usually low budget and created especially for the drive-in circuit, usually featuring a cut and dry "killer on the loose" plot. But while this one contains all those elements, it's surprisingly good. Ben Johnson , in a bit of a comedown role, and Andrew Prine are both good as a pair of cops on the trail of a serial killer in 1940's Texarkana. Based on a true story, a man wearing a flour sack as a mask sought out couples and women on deserted lovers lanes and assaulted and killed them. A couple of draggy moments, but overall a good film. This has been released on video several times by several companies, most recently by Goodtimes. You can probably find a copy at Wal-Mart for around seven or eight bucks.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mary Ann left the island and found something unusual</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first heard of "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" when someone mentioned it in "Scream". Now that I've seen it, I gotta say that I love it. The story goes like this: It's 1946. A voice-over tells us that following our victory in WWII, the American people are now steeped in optimism. One of the small towns that embodies this euphoria is Texarkana, Arkansas. It could be any small town in America. The only thing is, there's a killer going around murdering people on Lovers' Lane. Every three weeks, the fiend gets another couple. So, the police chief summons a detective (Ben Johnson) from Austin to help find the murderer. They search and search, but they don't catch the killer. There remain three theories about what happened to the thug: either he drowned in the swamp, or he got arrested for another crime, or he still walks free (maybe waiting to strike again).Is this flick a parable of America's violent underbelly, planning to make a comeback when the optimism diminished (and our inability to deal with it)? Or just a movie? Either way, it's one that you gotta admire. Probably the most surprising cast member is "Gilligan's Island" castaway Mary Ann Summers herself - I mean Dawn Wells - as one of the victims. I can just imagine her on the island, waking up one night and hearing a strange noise. She goes outside and gets butchered, as the other castaways don't hear her scream. Now they can only wait to die horrible deaths themselves.But I digress. This is a great movie.</fullReview>

Pierce's (He directed another documentary horror film, which was one of my favorites when I was a kid, THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK) Documentary/horror hit, touches all the right buttons in terms of scares &amp; at times humor, to make this film watchable. Much like the original THE Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE (1974) the film seems to have been shot while the real crimes were being committed, thus adding a creepy, grainy look that can get under you're skin at times if you allow it. Worth a look for fans into unsolved crime stories &amp; those who want something different to watch. But like a lot of films of this type, is not for everyone.*** (stars)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A hooded killer strikes on a quiet night in Texarkana, Arkansas in March 1946, attacking a young couple in their car, and leaving no clues and no motives. Well done move involves the killer quickly ripping the hood open and ripping out the wires, rendering the car useless, and taunting the two lovers by holding the wires up for them to see that he has disabled the car, and they cannot get away from him. Killer the pulls the guy out the window, seconds later, the girl. Such a brutal opening scene is difficult for the film to top, and indeed, the pacing falters a bit until the next attack.Finding the two bodies in the field during the rainstorm was effectively chilling, with the killer still in sight, but just out of range. Film then introduces Captain Morales into the mix, to try to find the killer.The kill scenes are some of the creepiest and most chilling on memory, they deliver scares and shocks, especially Dawn Wells' sequence, when the killer actually goes into his victim's house, having previously only attacked while his victim's were parked in cars on secluded roads. The hooded killer quietly stalking his victims in the dark was effectively creepy, and the acting is above average for this type of low budget horror. Unfortunately, the film is marred by some lulls in the action, during which time we have to tolerate really lame good ol' boy humour. The film's weakest link, indeed, is the painfully unfunny character called Sparkplug, played by producer/ director Charles Pierce, who should have known better.Bad music score, also. I think the film would have benefited by not using a music score, only ambient sounds. During the scenes with no music score, I think the film has more atmosphere and tension, rather than with the music score played through, which almost sounds prerecorded.Interesting to note also, that the film's climax takes place in broad daylight, which is unusual for a horror movie, especially one from this era.What the screenstory doesn't tell you is they think *maybe* they caught the killer. Youell Swinney was arrested for numerous car thefts, all of them coinciding with the killings. He made some kind of an obscure reference to the killings and even provided the police with an address book stolen from one of the victims, but he couldn't be connected directly to the killings. He was tried and convicted of several car thefts, all of which became a federal offense because he drove the cars across state lines, and was sent to a federal prison for life. As soon as he goes to prison the killings stopped. He was eventually acquitted due to inadequate representation at his trial and released from prison in 1972 after nearly 26 years in prison, he is believed to have moved to Dallas Texas and spent the rest of his life there and died in an old age home there in 1993. No one else was ever arrested for the killings.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>1946. No-nonsense Texas Ranger J.D. Morales (a fine and dignified portrayal by Ben Johnson) and earnest Deputy Norman Ramsey (an excellent and engaging performance by Andrew Prine) join forces to apprehend a vicious mysterious hooded psycho (played with creepy heavy-breathing intensity by Bud Davis) who's terrorizing the small rustic community of Texarkana, Arkansas. Director Charles B. Pierce, working from a solid script by Earl E. Smith (who also pops up in a small part as helpful shrink Dr. Kress), relates the absorbing story at a steady pace, offers a flavorsome evocation of the 40's period setting, ably crafts and sustains a strong atmosphere of dread, and hints at some pretty dark and depraved stuff throughout. The startling moments of savage violence pack a ferocious kick, with the infamous trombone murder rating as a definite memorably sick highlight. The use of both rural backwoods locations and locals in small roles gives this picture a sure feeling of authenticity. Dawn Wells makes a bravura appearance in one of the film's single most harrowing set pieces as near victim Helen Reed. Both Jaime Mendoza-Nava's haunting score and James W. Roberson's crisp widescreen cinematography are up to par. Vern Stierman's somber narration further enhances the overall gloomy and unsettling mood. However, the annoying comic relief deputy character played by Pierce seems painfully out of place. That criticism aside, this movie certainly deserves its cult status as a proto-slasher trailblazer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Decent serial killer horror, but nothing too special</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown is apparently based on a real life serial murder spree that occurred in the mid-1940's in Texarkana. Since I am not familiar with the actual case, I can't say how close the events in the film stay to the real murders. A hooded killer is stalking the inhabitants of a small town, always at night and at regular intervals. As the body count rises and the local police have no progress in their investigation, they bring in a Texas Ranger to help out with the case. But the townspeople have armed themselves and boarded up their windows, each afraid he or she will be the next victim.As I read other user comments about this movie, I see that I am in the minority-I didn't find this a great movie. I thought it was okay, but really just an average story. The acting is all right, but not exceptional. I have to admit that the killer is rather menacing though. We never see enough of him for long enough to really have any idea as to his motivation, his background or anything else about him, but his hooded face and overall demeanor is simply frightening.Others have praised the atmosphere and tension in this film and those were one of the stronger aspects to it. A sense of dread was maintained for most of it. But the plot moved too slowly and the comic relief was just annoying.Not a bad movie by any means, but nothing very special in my view.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The town?" is an early triumph in the serial-killer section of the horror genre, handling about a small American town terrorized by a masked murderer shortly after the end of World War II. Actually based on true events, the maniac picks out his victims on Lovers Lanes and shoots them without mercy. This important low-budget production, from the hands of the legendary producer Samuel Z. Arkoff, completely depends on unsettling atmosphere and the icky sound editing. The isolated location of a town of the edge of Texas and Arkansas has something raw, primitive and terrifying. This aspect is stressed extra by the grim voice-over that repeatedly informs us about the facts. Although you never get to know much about the killer's identity or personality, it's one of the most fascinating madmen in film history. His heavy breathing and primitive mask (similar to the one Jason Vorhees wore in F13 part 2) make him look truly chilling and mysterious. What's also great about this movie is that it features so many tricks and familiar sub-plots, only they were used here of the first time! Profiling of the killer, copycat behavior etc? All this makes "The Town that Dreaded Sundown" a vastly underrated and film and more horror fans should reckon its brilliance. Too bad it's so hard to obtain a decent copy of it. I spent years looking for this film before finally seeing it in poor picture quality. The only few flaws to detect is the lousy and typical redneck humor that director Charles B. Pierce inserts in order to lighten the demanding tone of the film. The same mistake also almost ruined Wes Craven's "Last House on the Left".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" has amassed a sizable cult over the years. To some degree, I can understand that; there is some genuine merit to be found in this low budget independently made movie. Despite those circumstances the film was made in, the movie generally looks very good, from the cinematography to the production values. The movie is also often directed in a very interesting quasi-documentary style, which gives the package some credibility. The best thing about the movie, however, are the scenes where the phantom killer strikes. These scenes are surprisingly creepy even by today's horror standards.But as I hinted in my summary line, the movie is not perfect. There is some obvious padding throughout, though that may have been inevitable since the real life phantom killer only attacked eight people. Also on occasion, the musical score is both strident and annoying. But the biggest problem in the movie is the comic relief. The comic relief is not only unfunny, but it's heavy-handed and embarrassing.Despite flaws such as those I mentioned in the previous paragraph, I think the movie is worth a look. It's never boring, and it is an interesting precursor to what was to come just a few years later: The slasher genre. I know of at least one 1980s slasher movie that was heavily influenced by this movie. See if you can figure out which one that was.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a slasher</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This came out 2 years before the Grandfather of slasher movies (Halloween). Although some may claim there were at least one other slasher movie before the one John Carpenter did, Halloween put the slasher movie on the map. So what is this? And does it even qualify as slasher movie? Because the Killer that this is based on apparently did not kill that many people to begin with.The story takes other liberties too and some things may qualify for the slasher genre (mask, some of the killings, the way the Killer "hunts" his victims, inventive killings, although the one with the trumpet I don't quite get), but overall it has so many other tones in it, it's tough to make a case of Carpenter having stolen a blueprint here. There are moment were this slides into slapstick too (car going too fast scene). That doesn't change the fact though that this is still a drama, dresses as pseudo documentary, with voice over and all, to make it more legit.Good try overall, but maybe a bit too slow for audiences now (and who knows, maybe even future audiences in general). That's something you have to make your mind up yourself.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Geez, no wonder the Phantom Killer got away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was surprised never to hear of the Texarkana Moonlight Murders until last night; I had studied the case of the Zodiac Killer and never knew an unknown prowler was terrorizing lovers lanes in the US 20 years earlier (I guess the fact that the so-called Phantom Killer never sent a single cipher is what makes him less interesting today). Nevertheless, after the Zodiac terrorized America, the Texarkana murders got the big screen treatment with The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976), a film that, I understand, got played in Texarkana every Halloween for years. The question is why, given the horror is undermined by bad attempts at comedy and that comedy is based on a rather unflattering portrayal of the local yokels. It turns out it's no wonder why the Phantom got away- according to this movie, it was because the Keystone Cops were on the case. The "Sparkplug" character was intolerable, far too stupid to be funny- he has no idea where keys go, and the fact that he drives a car carrying our hero detective into a swamp right when they've apprehended a main suspect is bewildering. In drag, he and the fat detective with the moustache as decoys also look like the least convincing teenagers I've ever seen in film. Given the creative liberties taken with the story, it's disappointing the Phantom never "got" Sparkplug- I surely would have been rooting for the killer in that scenario.It's a shame, because the rest of the film is fairly competently done- not so much as a slasher film but as a murder mystery, which is more of what I was after. They should have stuck with that approach.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effective horror jarred by some unnecessary comic interludes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Shortly after World War II ended, the community of Texarkana, Arkansas were finally piecing their lives back together and preparing for a time of harmony and peace. That is, until a masked psychopath, dubbed the 'Phantom Killer' by the press, starts a killing spree that will shake the city to its very core. Writer and director Charles B. Pierce (who also has a supporting role as a bumbling deputy) flaunts his artistic license with the events that actually occurred in 1946, informing us that "only the names have been changed," when in fact the story is altered considerably to form a traditional thriller narrative, yet the result is an effective horror.The Town That Dreaded Sundown could be labelled as one of the first 'slasher' movies, having emerged two years before John Carpenter's Halloween, the film that really kicked-off the genre. Yet while there is slashing-a-plenty, the film also works just as well as a police procedural and a docudrama, with the majority of the attention focusing on the heavy toll the murders take on the city's terrified inhabitants, and the desperate actions of the police trying to catch him. Reliable deputy sheriff Norman Ramsey (Andrew Prine) is given the task of overlooking the investigation, and when the few leads they have lead to dead-ends, legendary Texas Ranger J.D. Morales (Ben Johnson) - based on real-life Ranger Manuel 'Lone Wolf' Gonzaullas - is drafted in to take charge.The highlights of The Town That Dreaded Sundown come in the form of some very effective murder set-pieces. There are no drawn- out stalking scenes of hapless victims running screaming through the woods or lashings of over-the-top gore. Instead, the killings are brutal and straight-to-the-point, with the sound of killers near- orgasmic breathing, which are muffled through the killer's gunny sack disguise, proving incredibly discomforting. What I didn't expect was the sudden tonal shifts to slapstick comedy. The inept deputy 'Sparkplug', played by Pierce, seems to have wandered in from a Marx Brothers set, with his frequently idiotic mishaps, such as accidentally driving Ramsey and Morales into a lake for them to emerge wet and grumpy, jarring the film's flow and carefully built atmosphere. These unwelcome comedy interludes are a constant and unnecessary distraction, and means that the film falls way short of the 70's horror classic it could have been.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Bland proto-slasher with too many non-slasher elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Following a string of murders, a small-town detective and his staff join forces to find the masked, anonymous killer stalking their small Texas town as he continually stays ahead of their efforts to contain and stop his rampage.This one wasn't all that enjoyable of an effort and had quite a few problems. Among the many problems here is the fact that there's quite a large amount of of absolutely dull and lame pacing that makes this one such a drag to get through. With the main part of the film based around the factual details of the spree and police procedural investigations into the incidents, there's way too much feeling like this one isn't concerned with appearing all that much as a true slasher film. Though it pays attention to the details of the real-life crime spree at the forefront of the film's story, these come at the expense of telling a true slasher story that it really seems to want to be as this one does drop the documentary vibe for the rather fun slasher scenes but once those are finished this one goes back to the rather pedestrian pace featured for the other scenes throughout here is where this one really gets caught up in too many other areas here that put this too much at a documentary-like feeling. As well, that's another factor here where the film's documentary feel is attributed to factors accomplished here that are just plain useless here, eating up time quite often throughout here when it's focusing on the rather lame investigations done by the officers, whether it be the comedy of the officers attempting to catch the killer by dressing in drag or focusing on the citizens out there without any sort of positive proof on them beyond being simply in the vicinity. It's all part of the final half here being so overlong filled with these deviations in the tone causing this one to feel so jarring while it's going away from the slasher-film aesthetics it should've had. On top of these issues, the film also manages to feature a few other problematic areas in that there's some patently ridiculous features that's highly unlikely to be true, as the film's signature highlight kill is not only pure speculation to have actually happened but is so clunky and bizarre it's just awkward, the killer's features are completely guessed at and it's filled with way too many lame gunshot kills that are really holding this one back. Even with these flaws there's a few that are well-done here. What really works nicely here is when the film drops into prominent slasher territory which manages to feature some rather enjoyable and fun slasher scenes. The opening attack on the couple in the car makes for quite a thrilling opening when the killer appears and gains entry into the car in quite aggressive fashion, a later stalking scene out in the woods where he manages two highly-enjoyable kills with the area coming into play, and the finale chase through the sand-pit through the train tracks and the surrounding swamps which is quite a nice finish here. The other of the film's strengths is that the killer is genuinely frightening. Sporting the potato-sack look with icy blue eyes staring out from small peep-holes, sucking the bag in and out as he rapidly breathes and his tense and hulking stance make like for a visually imposing killer whose aggression and mental instability is palpable. Otherwise, this one isn't all that enjoyable.Rated R: Violence and Language.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What would you get if you took John Carpenter's classic HALLOWEEN and removed any and all suggestion(s) of the supernatural? That's right: THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN. The fact that this one's based on facts (to a degree) is all the more terrifying. While I'm no fan of slasher films (much less GORY slasher films), movies like this one- based on Real Life incidents- hold a morbid fascination. The almost palpable TENSION in THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN stems directly from the fact that it's "based on a true story." Filmmaker Pierce quite naturally takes some artistic liberties with the story, but the overall effect is still downright chilling. In this one, we find the template for most of the slasher films that would follow in the wake of HALLOWEEN (including, to a degree, HALLOWEEN itself). The idea that they never really nailed this guy is all the more frightening- even in retrospect.</fullReview>

And the town shows the movie in the park where the killings took place. That is pretty cool. The town actually embraces the murders, and realizes this movie is a cult classic.

		<shortDescription>Gritty and clinical approach to one of the country's most baffling unsolved crimes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" focuses on the small community of Texarkana, Texas, which was plagued by a series of gruesome murders in the 1940s that are to this day unsolved. Charles B. Pierce's cult classic is an interesting and everlasting piece of cinematic history for two reasons: firstly, it is based on a real life series of crimes; and secondly, the film itself presents the events in a clinical, detached, straightforward manner in the semblance of a true-crime documentary, yet without actually being a true-crime documentary. This unusual narrative approach really sets "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" apart from its peers, and its release in 1976 marks it as one of the prototypes for the slasher film as it's come to be known.The criminal investigation aspect is heavy-handed in the film, which is another unique nuance, as the film manages to balance the investigative side of the story with the outright horror of the crimes committed. On an aesthetic level, the film feels as though it were made in the late 1950s-early 1960s, partly because it's a period piece, but also partly just because of its visual elements, which recall the grit of that era's B-movies. It is stark and colorful, and at times reminded me of a more serious Herschell Gordon Lewis picture, especially with the hackneyed comedy elements that bubble to the surface at times.Overall, it is not hard to see why "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" entered the lexicon of horror, because it is truly a unique piece of film history, bolstered by the meta-fact that it was a film based on history. The clinical documentarian approach is chilling in all the right ways, and the film is engaging in spite of some dragging of its feet. Not a flawless film, but certainly one to be remembered. 7/10.</fullReview>

But Again, Director Pierce's On Screen Appearance as Spark Plug is Universally Acknowledged as a Big Error in a Film that Doesn't Have Many. The Docu-Style Adds Creepiness and Works Fine. The Film has Gained in Reputation Fast Because it is Finally Available in Pristine Prints on Blu-ray and Seeing it as Originally Presented Only Enhances the Experience and Brings an Appreciation for a Forgotten Film that has Lingered in the Memory of Drive-In and Grind-House Patrons and those that Only Know it by Word of Mouth or Awful Video Releases &amp; Bootlegs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I was surprised at how much enjoyed this film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really a true crime nut or a fan of blood and gore horror movies. I only tracked this movie down because I have had a 50 year crush on the lovely Dawn Welles. I didn't even expect to last out the entire film. However, I was drawn in from the opening scene to the final scene. I found the appearances of the Phantom Killer to be riveting, as well as truly scary. I jumped out of my seat when the Phantom appeared at the window behind the man sitting and reading the newspaper. The infamous trombone scene really freaked me out. Considering the budget, this movie is exceptional. I knew that the Texarkana murders of 1946 were never officially solved, so the ending was no surprise to me.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>****SPOILERS**** True story of the notorious "Phantom Killer" who stalked the lovers lanes as well as homes of Texarkana Arkensas who ended up murdering five and wounding six, mostly teenagers, people in the late winter and early spring of 1946. Desperate to catch the elusive killer the town's sheriff office hired top Texas Ranger investigator Captain J.D "Lone Wolf" Morales, Ben Johnson, to track the "Phantom Killer" down. The killer dressed in baggy pants and wearing a burlap sack over his head seemed to have trouble breathing, he may have been suffering from asthma, but had no trouble out running the police or sheriff deputies! As well as him surviving getting shot and crawling into the nearby snake and alligator infested swamps or bayous where he was never seen or heard from again!In fact the truth of the matter is that the "Phantom Killer" was never shot or even seen, with his burlap shack off, by anyone and just disappeared, after his last shooting spree on May 3 1946, off the face of the earth. The movie has its share of suspense as well as terror as the hooded killer stalks the night and keeps the people in the town of Texarkana behind locked doors too terrified to wounder out, even to buy groceries, when the sun goes down. Capt. Morales together with Deputy Norman Ramsey, Andrew Prine, finally track the killer down walking , with his burlap sack on, down the road in broad daylight without a care in the world until he spots them and makes a run for it. Having no difficulty outrunning the pair, even after being shot, the "Phantom Killer" slips into the nearby swamps and, without any scuba equipment, goes underwater and makes his getaway!****SPOILERS**** The very unconvincing ending spoiled everything that was positive about the movie in turning the "Phantom Killer" into another, some four years before he made his film debut, Jason of "Friday the 13th" fame. In not being able to come up with a good ending it had to be fictionalized by the script writers to make it work. The film in fact ends some 30 years later in 1976 where we see the premier of the film "The Town that Dreaded Sundown" in the town of Texarkana and guess who's waiting in line to see it? The "Phantom Killer" himself, as we only see his well polished shoes or loafers, as he's limping on his way to buy his ticket at the box-office to see, I would assume, just how accurate the movie is about his exploits back in 1946!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loosely Based on a True Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is loosely based on a true story which took place in the city of Texarkana which just happens to to be located directly on the Texas and Arkansas state lines. Anyway, in 1946 a serial killer began attacking innocent people in the rural areas outside of Texarkana. Now, according to the movie the killings took place mostly on the Arkansas side during a period of almost 6 months. In reality they occurred on the Texas side and lasted for approximately10 weeks (from 22 February to 3 May). Likewise, other discrepancies can also be found if a person wanted to research them but suffice to say this clearly wouldn't be the first time a true story is embellished for artistic purposes. On that note, as far as the film is concerned the overall plot seemed to be a bit disjointed as it combined elements of a documentary, comedy, crime-drama and horror movie. Unfortunately, the horror isn't very keen and the comedic portions weren't that funny. So in essence the movie succeeds only as a crime-drama which is narrated in a style similar to a documentary. I liked the performances of Ben Johnson (as "Captain J.D. Morales" of the Texas Rangers) and Andrew Prine (as "Deputy Norman Ramsey"). Along with that I liked the inclusion of Dawn Wells ("Helen Reed") who some people might recognize as "Mary Ann" of Gilligan's Island fame. In any case, this was an interesting movie for the most part and in spite of the uneven feel of it all I rate it as about average.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Not Bad!"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 1976 thriller stars Ben Johnson, Andrew Prine and Dawn Wells. This film is based on actual events and takes place in the late 1940's in Texas where a mysterious killer known as "The Phantom Killer" lurks about terrorizing certain victims. The late, Johnson (Terror Train) plays Police Captain, J.D. Morales who hunts the killer with help from Sheriff Deputy, Norman Ramsay (Prine). Wells (Gilligan's Island) plays Helen Reed, one of the killer's victims and the film's late director, Charles B. Pierce also appears as goofy patrolman, A.C. 'Sparkplug' Benson. This film isn't bad and sort of like a documentary combined with a bit of western and slapstick elements. You can also see where "Friday the 13th II" got their idea for Jason wearing the potato sack like the killer here. I recommend checking this out at least once.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odd Docu-Drama Horror variation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For years, I had heard about THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN as one of those indescribably scary low-budget films that seem to disappear all too frequently into relative obscurity. It's never been released on DVD, and it's TV showings are few. Paradoxically, the story within the film also plays upon those self-same virtues of unseen mystery. "Based on a true story" (are there more frequently misleading words written on film credits?), the film is very much done as a police procedural with some striking moments of slasher stylistics (the trombone sequence in particular). Ben Johnson plays a legendary 'big city' cop brought in to clean up the small-town mess, and the story unfolds in an almost documentary-like form, complete with Narration. Director Charles B. Pierce (of the BOGGY CREEK films) non-style style works in a curious way that slicker films can't match. Dawn Wells and Andrew Prine provide pro support for what is largely an amateur cast (again, not a bad thing here). The coda to the film is uniquely Pierce. That's all I'll say. That the film doesn't quite live up to the legend isn't surprising, but, in an odd way, that adds to the allure.Grindhouse Fest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Absolutely Scary!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was this movie when I was a kid and it sticks with me to this day. I'm a big fan of horror movies, but very few actually give me the creeps. The only ones I can think of are Halloween, The Exorcist, and the scene in Salems Lot where the little vampire is scratching on his brothers window. This one ranks right up there with those! I would love to find a version of it on DVD. It use to run regularly on TBS, but I haven't seen it on in years. If your a fan of horror movies you will love this one. It's dark, and of course it's a little dated, but still creepy. Some of the most suspenseful scenes you will find. And it doesn't hurt that it's based on a true story. It's possible the real killer could still be a live to this day! Glad I don't live in Texas!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>*POTENTIAL SPOILERS* Man oh man this one was a real piece of work and I mean that in a good way if that is possible. Based on the exploits of the "Phantom Killer" in Texarkana, Texas. All I can say is he was one demented, sick wacko. Highly intelligent, methodical, flawlessly careful, strong as an ox, and totally fearless. Anyone who watches serial killer movies will find this one interesting if not albeit entertaining. I don't know if I would watch it twice as it is disturbing to say the least. He thoroughly enjoys what he does and that is mutilating and killing people. The subject of one of the largest law enforcement manhunts in U.S. history, he goes around wacking civilians out in the same town right under their noses and they can't even slow him down much less stop him or identify him. I'm just glad I don't live in that town you could be borrowing sugar from this fella even today.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know what to think about this movie. I mean, there is an absolutely harrowing scene where a girl is tied to a tree and then stabbed with a knife the killer ties to the end of the girl's own trombone; then maybe a few minutes later a ridiculous car chase takes place that ends with the dumb, comic relief cop of the movie jumping Dukes of Hazzard style over other cars to land in a swamp. The comic relief stuff did not work in this movie at all. Which was a shame, because the killer's attacks were scary (Mary Ann from Gilligan's Island is one of the victims, and she played it pretty well!). The movie switched from serious horror and police procedure to loopy, small town goofiness. It didn't make much sense. Andrew Prine as the deputy sheriff was good, though. Ben Johnson reminded me of Jackie Gleason in Smokey and the Bandit too much. All in all, I'd say check it out for some decent horror elements, just ignore some of the more irritating stuff. 5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Great Movie, But It Brings Back Memories</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie was in a drive-in theater in the summer of 1976. I was 8 years old and I went with my cousin. We were staying at a cabin at a lake which is open for camping every summer. I don't think I was mature enough to watch a horror movie like this, but I believe this movie planted a seed in me for a love of horror movies. I remember having a very hard time falling asleep that night thinking that there was a killer lurking outside the cabin. The thing that stuck in my mind was that it was based on a true story and the commentary in the film made it feel like a documentary.I watched this movie again for the second time just weeks ago, and I can see how a young mind could be captivated with this film. The hackles still raised on the back of my neck during some of the suspenseful scenes. The acting is second rate and by today's standards in filmmaking, the movie is not very good. The comedy elements in the movie just don't mesh with the realism portrayed in the commentary and the dramatic scenes with the killer. Although, in watching the movie again, it brought back memories of the good old days.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoiler: My comments will refer to the real case upon which this film is based. The events depicted in the film actually happened in Texarkana, TX from February 23, 1946 until May 4,1946. An unknown serial killer murdered five individuals and wounded three other individuals severely. The film is accurate as to the murders themselves. The surviving witnesses described the killer as a powerful man, whose face was concealed by a flour sack. The end of the film is fiction. The killer was never chased into the swamp. However, it is true that the killer was never identified. In fact, the killer may have claimed a sixth murder victim, a tramp's body was found near the railroad track in Texarkana, and he had been stabbed to death. Once again, the murder was never solved. The actual Texas Ranger involved in the case was Captain M. T. Gonzaullas, known as the "Lone Wolf", a book about his career exists. For additional information about the case itself, please see Michael Newton's book, The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers, pp. 160-161.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A well-rounded thriller,that has aged pretty-well.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While this film has aged some,it has a rough-and-grainyness and a sorta "Documentation" feel that is effective.A little-known director I've long admired,Mr.Charles Pierce also directed "The legend of the Boggey-Creek Monster",and some little known Westerens and some more thrillers.I also enjoyed those,mainly because I grew-up near Shreveeport La.,and have heard tales about the Boggey-Creek monster for sometime since I was young.Years ago,when I first discovered the horror genre,I came across a little-known thriller called "The town that Dreaded Sundown". What fascinated me about it was it's look and the Phantom Killer stuck on the cover was an image of interest to a young boy that was only six-years-old,and whose viewing habbits consisted of watching episodes of "The Transformers" on TV and fantasy/kid shows like "Laybrinth".Now nothing wrong with that;To this day I'm a big Jennifer Connelly fan(a solid,underrated actress),and still a loveable Trans-Fan,but Horror had a big part of my growing-up.Getting-back to the film,It's a story that concerns a real-life masked killer nick-named "The Phantom".Early on,the narrarator tells a small prologue about the towns history,and then the first beating on a couple takes place on a lonely road in Texarcanna.Now,the impact of the film is that things like this didn't happen back then,and as the story un-folds,we see the town sulk into suspetion and terror as two lawman hunt-down the killer.Two more separate murder sequences'happen,and soon the police are on search for the Phantom Killer,and soon things un-fold more.Though,not always successful;The director himself(Charles B.Pierce)takes-on the task of an comic-releif deputy(I doubt there was a Patrolman Benson in real-life),and there are some down-sides. For the most part,the film will seem to most people like an extra-long Dragnet episode,but it does play well.Other un-funny things is some un-scary music playing while the films best moments(like the Trombone-torture of Pierce's then-wife Cindy Butler)have little music;At least it makes for a creepier sequence.As for a whole,the film is still worth a rental for people to discover it.But be warned about some things:One being that the truth was bent.Take that ending for example.Yes it's silly for the Phantom Killer to be walking around in his trademark hood and "killing" clothes in broad-daylight,but at least it sets-up a pleasing chase scene for the final reel.And some of the performers are not great in their roles,but at least leads(en Johnson,Andrew Prine)deliver,and makes it worthwhile.So,if you wanna know more,click on a link and maybe you will discover a neat film,and will scare you with what you don't see.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a bit outdated but famous due the killer and the real events</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This flick here is much spoken among the horror geeks. their are a few reasons why, because it's based (loosely) on the real Texarkana Moonlight Murders. A serial killer called the Phantom Killer that had never been captured even as their were survivors of his killing spree. So it was a hot thing for years in the city itself. On the other hand this flick never had a proper release digitally until in 2013 when it finally hit Blu Ray. Therefor it was out there only on VHS and a lot of bootlegs DVD's.A hot item indeed and liking flicks about real serial killers I had to catch me a copy to see what's it all about. Being made just before the slasher era but at a time horror was to become the next big thing, Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974) just delivered the goods, it's a bit low on the gore site but still it is watchable. maybe for some it can be outdated because it moves slowly and the killings aren't that creepy at all but it's the killer who delivers the goods. His way of hiding his face is notorious and is seen in other flicks (Fridat The 13th part 2 (1981) and Nightbreed (1990). If you are into serial killers then this is a must see even as it is loosely based on the real killings still some parts did in fact happen back then. It's slow and doesn't has the scary parts like it should but worth picking up for many reasons.Gore 0,5/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 1/5 Story 2,5/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

I took interest in the time period as well. People back then had much more to fear as a killer like that was not a common thing. Now days, a new killing is in the daily news.Now on to the true low down of this film. I found it to be slow, boring and all too familiar. For as cool as it was that this movie was before Friday the 13th's time, F-13th and the pt.2 (baghead) was much more entertaining then this film. I'd say 85 to 90% of this film was all about the police looking for clues. Overall, boring.My favorite thing about this film was the ending as short as it was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>More creepy than scary, this docudrama about a hooded "phantom" who terrorized Texarkana in the late 1940s isn't bad. Charles B. Pierce directs with a sure hand and he had the good sense to cast reliable Ben Johnson as the federal man charged with finding the killer. There's plenty of attention to detail, a lot of creepy scenes of the silent killer at work and some terrific acting by not only Johnson but also by Andrew Prine and Dawn Wells (pantomiming the role of a hapless victim). Pierce does make the mistake of attempting to inject the film with some misplaced humor (mostly involving himself -- playing the role of a dim-witted rookie cop). The dire narration, of which there is probably too much, is by Vern Stierman. Pierce, who made a number of fairly lousy films in the 70s &amp; 80s, would later direct the very effective shocker THE EVICTORS.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First off, this killer was never extraordinary. Sure it was the 40s, but there was always someone getting killed in Texarkana, whether it was the 40s or the 70s. The far scarier (real life) character was depicted by Pierce in his LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK film. That had the whole area freaked out back then because that creature screwed up some people's lives.What was different about this particular serial killer is that he preyed on people. You weren't safe at home, coming out of your church, or heck, even your own outhouse. In Texarkana all the kids would go to Spring Lake Park to screw their girlfriends, and yes, I banged a lot of girls in that park. The LAST thing you want when you're banging some babe is for some jackass to walk up on you and stab you. I mean, hail, you're naked, you're in the moment, and you don't notice the dude with the hood over his head until your already cut.Let's just say it ruins the date.Charles Pierce was a cool guy in the 70s &#x2014; still is. But while he made movies on the cheap (nowadays we call them Indy films), he was very serious about his craft. Like a lot of folks in the movie business, Charles had Herculean work habits, and he was an excellent editor. Check this movie out. It will make you appreciate the 70s genre more than Tarantino ever could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting insight into the origins of the slasher movie...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Halloween is without a doubt my favourite ever horror movie. It was my first taste of terror and I became obviously aware that I had found something that I loved in those supreme slasher shenanigans. Eager to relive the experience, I ran round to the local video store, hoping that I would uncover something else that could provide me with similar top-notch entertainment. After witnessing a myriad of clones, Friday the 13th, Terror Train etc. I came to the forgone conclusion that it alone -was the true originator of the genre. The older I got and the more knowledge that I gained, I found out that the category had been around long before Michael Myers escaped an asylum and stole a blank Captain Kirk mask to stalk some hapless babysitters. Efforts like Black Christmas, Class Reunion Massacre, Savage Weekend and Drive in Massacre had already laid down the groundwork, all John Carpenter had to do was use his talent to make sure that the ?rules' were engraved in stone. That's not any kind of criticism on my favourite underground helmer, it's just that I was convinced that he had heralded the idea without any outside inspiration. One other early offering that certainly had strong involvement in spawning horror's most mainstream style, was The Town that Dreaded Sundown. It was mentioned in Scream along with all the other proven founders and as another reference to its necessity, Jason Voorhees pinched the killer's disguise for his murderous debut, before he found a Hockey mask and boiler suit to be a more comfortable form of attire. It's set in 1946, just a few months after the War, when the world was just beginning to regain some peace and serenity. After a narrated introduction, we switch to a scenario that would be reproduced time and time again throughout the years that followed. A young couple are parked up on a ?Lover's Lane', isolated in some reclusive woodland. Sammy, tries the usual methods for getting his wicked way with his moody girlfriend, but she gives him the cold-shoulder. Isn't that always the way in slasher movies? One has to wonder why a lady would even drive out into the woods with her beau in the first place, if she were only going to reject him on arrival? Nevertheless, it's become almost as commonplace in these films as a knife-wielding killer. Almost immediately, menacingly shoddy boots appear between the trees and we hear familiar heavy panting that usually always means someone's in trouble. A guy with a sack over his head pops open the bonnet of the lovebird's car and rips out the spark plug lead, so the teens have no escape. Next he smashes the window and pulls the unfortunate boy through the frame, leaving blood dripping from the shattered glass. After the assailant has dealt with him, he returns to the vehicle to take care of the screaming female. Thankfully, he doesn't actually kill those two, but his next victims are not so lucky. And so begins a reign of terror as the hooded assassin continues to bring havoc to the town that begins to dread the time of sundown?To class this as just a routine slasher film would be somewhat unfair. For the best part, this is wholly authentic, boasting a few elements that have remained uncommon to regular genre pieces. It's the only stalk and slash flick that I can think of that's loosely based on a true story and because it's set in the forties, it has a periodic look that's never been reinstated, only in the case of the odd opening prologue on rare occasions. Academy award-winner Ben Johnson sleepwalks his role, delivering a disappointingly colourless performance. Sadly, none of the supporting cast members shows any credible professionalism either. The teenage victims proved to be the worst of the bunch, leisurely moaning ?please no?' when they were confronted by the killer and sounding more like they were telling a dinner host that they didn't want any dessert, instead of begging for their lives! The director tries to incorporate a happy medium between the fear and some needless slapstick that just feels completely unnecessary. Horror-comedies hardly ever work, and this just acts as further damning evidence. It ends up looking like a bizarre hybrid of Friday the 13th and Carry on Camping (!), which doesn't prove to be as fun as it sounds like it should be. Every time the killer makes an appearance the atmosphere becomes quite effectively creepy, but then the director unwisely chooses to immediately follow it up with some frankly ludicrous attempts at humour, that are truly non-fitting. Black Christmas was made in 1974 and this was released some two years later; although you'd never in a million years guess that was the case. Bob Clark's classic looks like a brand-new movie compared to this elderly offering, which could easily be mistaken for being at least a decade older. It's literally begging for digital restoration and nothing could be quite as ancient as the horrendously out of place music, which sounds like it would have suited Mary Poppins more adequately than any kind of horror flick. Usually the genre depends on its instrumental-themes to help tighten the tension. Even Carpenter admitted that Halloween would've been a totally different story without the help of the memorable work from ?The Bowling Green Orchestra'. This is perhaps the worst choice for un-atmospheric accompaniment in the whole history of scary movies. It's not that it isn't played competently, and I sincerely mean no offence to the musicians; it's just that it was the wrong kind of music to set the right state of mind and what we really needed was something far more suited, to escort the often-inviting scenes that were left painfully unaided.Where it really matters, The Town that Dreaded Sundown delivers the goods exquisitely. Even though he may just be another masked psycho with heavy breath, ?The Phantom Killer' (as he's known) manages to come across as an effectively sinister stalker. In one scene, he ties a young girl up to a tree and murders her boyfriend right in front of her eyes. On his way over to deal with the unfortunate female after, he finds a trombone lying in the grass and creates himself a weapon by tying a switchblade to the end. It may sound like a silly idea, but keep in mind that he does all this while she's pleading for survival right in front of him, completely unaware of her grisly fate. Perhaps the most disturbing thing is the fact that it's based on a true story, which really helps to make it all the more fearsome. Credit also has to be given for the time taken to acknowledge the fear that was created around the small Texarkana town where the murders took place. Ordinary folk beg the police for protection and the media campaign for the killer to be brought to justice. Nut-jobs offer false confessions and the struggles of the people are portrayed realistically, giving the viewer a chance to sympathise with their pains. Most slasher films concentrate mainly on dispatching some victims and forget to include the extreme grief that it would inflict upon an average community. It was a good use of insight that made a neat change from the norm. Admittedly, this does look a little long in the tooth to be thoroughly recommended and the attempts at comedy were truly disastrous. Still, if you are a fan of slasher films, The Town that Dreaded Sundown is a decent insight into the roots of the genre. It was released before knifes had become an essential ingredient, so unfortunately most of the murders are committed with a gun. The stalking scenes still build up some credible suspense, and at times it even manages to deliver the odd noteworthy scare. It's just a shame that Charles Pierce presumed that we needed comic-refreshment, when what we really wanted was more morbid mayhem! </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More Funny Than Scary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>&amp;#65279;POSSIBLE SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!!!I just saw this movie for the second time again in my life just three nights ago (on Encore True). The cops in this movie (other than Johnson and Prine) are sheer idiots. They wreck patrol cars, are generally inept, and are thickheaded characters with no depth or or even decent characterizations. The parts where they dress as women as a ruse to catch the killer are super hilarious.The killer himself also has some ludicrous moments as well, especially when he kills the second girl he has tied to a tree with a long knife attached to the end of a trombone! Imagination...or poor writing? You be the judge.Also, in regard to the comments made by another viewer about Dawn Wells in this movie, she was NEVER tied to a tree during the film. She simply crawled around in a cornfield and hid from the killer until she got to a house where help was available. Two other girls were tied to trees, but not Wells. Maybe it was one of them who was really screaming about the snake that appeared during the actual shot.Not really worth searching for, but catch it on cable if you can. Dawn Wells was still gorgeous during the filming, just as she still is twenty-five years later. Good " getting together with a group of friends" flick as well.</fullReview>

I don't go for this gory horror like Texas Chainsaw Massacre, or Nightmare On Elm Street. If this happened today. Police officers would be warning kids, not to park. At night the police, sheriff's department, state troopers and a SWAT team, would be on the case, trying to capture the phantom.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mediocre serial killer document</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the facts surrounding this case are interesting, this film is a meandering attempt to pad out the events into a full length movie. In 1946, a murdered with a white hood over his head commits a series of attacks over the course of four months in Texarkana, causing the area to plunge into an atmosphere of fear and paranoia. The sequences that reenact the murders are chilling in the way they portray the killer as relentless and unstoppable, and you can see the roots of 70s slasher movies in this film.But it also suffers from an inappropriate level of comic relief, provided by stereotypically bumbling police. A series of voice-over narratives defuses any real tension in the movie between the attack scenes, so all we're left with is a subplot about a police investigation full of stock characters. The historical facts also work against the film, since the audience is likely to already know the killer was never apprehended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unconvincing drive-in fare</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN was released at the time when the majority of drive-in theaters in the United States were suffering their death throes. This film quite possibly hastened their demise. It was obviously filmed quickly and on a low budget. The credibility of the story, set in 1946 and purportedly based on real events, was hurt by lack of attention to period detail. The most blatant of these scenes occurred during the high school prom sequence. Costumes and hair styles shown were straight out of the mid-1970s, and similar errors were sprinkled throughout the balance of the film. The film makers also introduced several unsubtle and unfitting attempts at humor periodically, and these tended to break the flow of the story line rather than relieve tension as intended. The most horrifying event in the entire film took place during one of these "humorous" scenes, when a vintage police car was driven into a swamp by an incompetent deputy and subsequently sank. The purposeless destruction of an antique car was much more disgusting than any of the badly acted and unconvincing murder scenes portrayed. Overall, a disappointing film that could have been vastly improved by the application of a little craftsmanship.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was okay, but nothing more. It could have been SO much better. It was based on a true story, so the premise was scary, but it was executed very poorly. There were a lot of comedy scenes that had absolutely no reason to be in this movie(they weren't even funny). Also, the movie was filmed so darkly that it is almost impossible to make out what's going on half the time. This movie had the potential to be good, but unfortunately, it was not. I think that if they were to re-make this movie with a better cast/budget and a script more accurate to the actual events, it would turn out much better.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not so much a horror as a police procedural</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Chiefly notable as a precursor of the rash of slasher flicks that hit the screens from the late 70s, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is as about as good as its title: if you think it's a great title, you're probably going to enjoy this flick, but if you think it sounds like the title of some cheap 50s pulp novel you're not going to be that impressed ? although you are, at least, going to have an idea of what to expect.Filmed in a docudrama style with a narrator providing huge chunks of information between killings, the film purports to give a true account of the 'Phantom Killer' that stalked the town of Texakarna directly after the war. Apparently, the film plays fairly fast and loose with the truth, inserting a bizarre 'murder by trombone' scene that is not only entirely fictional but also poorly shot. And while the film may efficiently transmit all the information it aims to, it fails to entertain as it does so. The characters are so sketchily drawn that they are little more than mobile cardboard cut-outs, and we are therefore left feeling indifferent to their plight. This failing isn't helped by the fact that many of the performances are inadequate to say the least, with only veteran 'name' Ben Johnson passing muster. Added to this is the misguided decision to add a number of 'comic relief' sequences ? involving a comedy cop called 'Spark Plug' ? which are truly annoying and completely out of step with the tone of the rest of the film.Where the film scores strongest is in the details it provides about the impact the killings have on the town and its people as they go about boarding up their windows and observing self-imposed curfews. These are only brief moments, though, montage shots during the narration, and fail to save the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown -- THE MUSICAL!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>My wife and I rented this one after she remembered how much her father loved it. She said it used to scare the Ba-Jesus out of him when he was a young man.So, we watched it. "Town" wasn't what I expected. It's kind of a docudrama that really doesn't have much drama in it. However, it does have lots of police cars in it and they're dramatic -- aren't they?Anyway, the story, which is supposedly true, unfolded with all the tension of a pancake. The director just trudged along ... "And then they did this... and then they did this." He didn't approach "Town" with a thought of how he could build up the suspense. It just languished in a feeling of promised panic it failed to deliver.As a slasher flick, there was the trombone death. Odd. Very odd. By far though, the best was Dawn "Mary Ann" Wells' death. That was the only really great scene in the whole movie.Beyond the occasional killing and in between the baritone newscast narration, was another oddity. There was this deputy sheriff who was supposedly in "Town" for comic relief. He would smash his car into things and just act goofy. This just left me with a furrowed brow, as I thought to myself, "Why is this Jerry Lewis-wannabe in this film?" Other reviewers stated the same thing too. He was just completely out of place and completely unfunny.It was this deputy's antics that got me really thinking. This movie doesn't work as a horror film. It doesn't work as a drama, but what if it were ... A MUSICAL! Just think ... chorus lines, big production numbers involving trombone-induced murders, a snappy rhythm and a goofy deputy! It works, man! It works! 6/8/00</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This could have been a terrifying film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN was inspired in many ways by Wes Craven's superior film THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT. It is a good film to try and emulate but there are reasons that Craven's film was the way it was. LHOTL was a terrfying film. It was one that kept me disturbed days after I watched it. I drove around for hours after the tape ended just trying to calm myself down. True horror can do that to you. I believe that is why Cunningham and Craven had humour in the film. They knew that there was enough horror to keep you out of breath. The comedy with the inept deputies was almost like a breather. I think the makers of this film thought they had a similar work of art in their hands.They were wrong.TTTDS is a fairly good horror film---- when it is horrific. The scenes of murder and stalking are quite well done. There is a true sense of fear and anxiety when the Phantom Killer is stalking his victims. Especially well done is when he is trying to kill Marianne, of Gilligans Island. This is where some of the best camera work is achieved. We have point of view shots from the killer, point of view shots from Marianne and we have some truly disturbing shots of the killer carrying a pick-axe. At first, the two victims are just shot. But then when she lives and runs out into the cornfield, we see the killer pick up a pick-axe. And we feel for her. At least if she was dead, she was so because of gunshot wounds. But the thought of a miners pick-axe being impaled into her skull or back is quite a nasty thought. Also quite well done is a scene where a trombone is used to torture someone. Although in reality, I think the torture would have lasted much longer than it did, but that does not really matter. What does matter is the style it was done in. And that style has to be given full kudos. These scenes are quite creepy and they are ripe with tension. But it is when the film is working in the light of day and away from the killer that it fails, and it fails miserably.There are way too many elements of comedy here. And this is where the pastiche of LHOTL is not what is needed. This film does not contain enough true terror to need maudlin comedy to relieve the viewer of his or her veritable increase in pulse. I enjoyed the scenes of murder for their style but they did not make me afraid or uneasy. I was intrigued with how the director accomplished the feat but it was not terrifying enough to justify all the incoherent comedy. This directly takes away from the over all aesthetic of the film. And that is too bad.If The Town That Dreaded Sundown could have concentrated more on it's Wes Craven like qualities and steered away from Buster Keaton like antics then this would have been a fine addition to the horror family. As it stands, it is an ersatz of the very thing that it tries to imitate.5 out of 10Just an interesting side note. This is one more film that used the name Loomis as one of their characters. That name was started with PSYCHO, used again in HALLOWEEN and then again in SCREAM. Quite an homage to Hitchcock. But then again, he is the pioneer of the horror genre. He deserves all the homage that is bestowed upon him.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Some people love this film, Some hate it.I grew up in Texarkana, I was in the film as an extra in several scene. I dated one of the girls "killed" in the film and I was friends with the director, Charles B. Oierce.It's not a bad film for what it is - a low budget drive-in film. There have been better and worse. Its enjoyable.However, some people think it's the film depicts the Phantom Killings as they happened. It doesn't. The film takes a lot - and I mean a LOT - of liberties with the truth.For the record, the Phantom Killer assaulted one couple and killed two other couples. The motive was robbery. He was caught - his name was Yuell Swinney - but there wasn't enough evidence to convict him of the murders. Much of what the police had came from Swinney's wife - she led them to items stolen in the robbery, was present at one set of killing - but she would not and could not be made to testify against her husband. They did convict him of car theft, his third felony, and he went away for life.But one of his earlier convictions was overturned. He was released in the 1970s but was back in prison within a year. He died years later in Dallas, in a secure nursing home, suffering from dementia.The last attack on a "farmer" and his wife - played by Dawn Wells - was not an actual Phantom incident. It was assumed to be at the time. But nothing fit the MO and the gun was different. Also, the "farmer" was a well-known local fence and bookmaker. It was most likely a local gangland killing - Texarkana had a lot of organized criminal activity back then.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Town That Dreaded Sundown, The (1976) *** (out of 4) Cult drive-in favorite about the true story of a hooded killer terrorizing the people of a small town in Arkansas. In terms of story there's nothing overly special here and in many ways this is a rather ordinary film but there's no denying that there are some powerful moments scattered throughout and the film is worth viewing for them. Director Charles B. Pierce is best remembered for this film and THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK and he uses the same documentary-style filmmaking that he did for his earlier Bigfoot film. I think the documentary style works and hurts the film. It hurts the film because it means we have narration going on throughout the film and I've never been thrilled when films resort to this. It also doesn't help that some of the narration just gives some pretty useless and at times silly dialogue that doesn't move the film any. The one thing this style does do is make you feel as if you're right there in the middle of the action and this is especially true during the murder scenes. The most effective moments are without question the ones where the "Phantom Killer" is doing his stuff because there's no doubt that the look of the killer is one of the most chilling in film history. Friday THE 13TH PART 2 and THE STRANGERS both "borrowed" the look of the killer here but and it's really no shock that it works well in all three films. The way the mask appears against the dark woods just adds a creepy feel to the entire film and the hick locations also adds to the atmosphere. There are several scenes where the killer quietly stalks the victims and these scenes manage to be quite eerie and unsettling. Director Pierce does a pretty good job in these moments but I think the film would have benefited from a little faster pace and there are moments where the film gets a bit too dry. Another problem is that there's some comic relief thrown in and this really breaks the mood of the film. Performances are good for the most part with Ben Johnson and Andrew Prine really standing out. THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN is a film with many problems and while it's far from the perfect movie it does contain enough creepy scenes to make it worth viewing. Also, having watched a HD 2.35:1 print of the film this also helped as it didn't have that cheap, worn down look of many VHS and bootleg releases.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is another one of those cases ? like the recently-viewed DR. RENAULT'S SECRET (1942) and ALICE SWEET ALICE (1976) ? where I've been vaguely aware of a film but only became truly cognizant of its value after watching it. Frankly, the killer title makes one think that a vampire movie is in store but what we get here instead is an admirable, semi-documentary rendition of a true-life outbreak of serial killing in post-war Texarkana, Arkansas ? complete with solemn narration, re-enactments preceded by dates and a 'where are they now' epilogue. Having said that, the dramatic storyline (capped by a terrific if necessarily downbeat climax) is punctuated both by a chilling depiction of the crimes themselves ? perpetrated by a potentially impotent sadist/cannibal, dubbed "The Phantom Killer", whose facial features are forever masked by a creepy KKK-like hood ? and, surprisingly enough, by the clumsy antics of an ill-tempered police official (amusingly essayed by the film's own producer-director Charles B. Pierce ? whose only other intriguing credits are 1972's similarly documentary-style THE LEGEND OF BOGGY CREEK and the 1978 Lee Majors-Cornel Wilde Viking opus, THE NORSEMAN). While these largely comic interludes may seem on paper to jar with the film's generally somber tone, one only needs to compare those particular scenes here with the equally irreverent ones found in Wes Craven's THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT (1972) to see how grating they can be when done badly ? as opposed to providing a welcome respite from the unbearably tense atmosphere as they do in this case!Furthermore, the main reason that such scenes succeed so well is because out-of-town and near-legendary Sheriff Ben Johnson (whose casting is inspired) is usually on the receiving end of incompetent Pierce's overzealous actions (not least when he manages to lose the lead in a car chase and lands the police vehicle head first into a stream). On the other hand, the fact that almost everybody else in the cast is an unknown aids in the film's ultimate striving for realism ? making eventual comparisons with contemporaneous 'slasher' movies quite pointless (although the use of a slide trombone-cum-bayonet as a murder weapon is a bizarrely inventive touch certainly worthy of the more outrageous entries in that subgenre).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a slasher, actually a good serious serial-killer movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'll admit that I watched this movie expecting it to be a slasher flick. I mean an '70's movie with such a premise and a movie title like "The Town That Dreaded Sundown"? How could this not be a slasher. The movie however is actually a serious one, that is based on true events, about an hooded killer who killed a bunch of people in 1946 in a small town.It's not an exploitation flick so the movie is not filled with blood and gore. The movie is also not necessarily an horror, though it still knows how to create a creepy kind of atmosphere at times, which is more due to its realism and story-telling this time. The movie is definitely better written than similar type of movies of the same era and it's made with real class and integrity. The movie is even being a somewhat semi-documentary of the events, though the story of course got still Hollywoodized.The story is of course all the more intriguing since it got based on actual events. The real killer was never caught and he showed some surprising similarities with the later Zodiac killer. Who knows, perhaps it was the same person, coincidence or someone who was inspired by these killings.Despite its obvious low budget the movie still really manages to be a great looking and great told movie, that is always intriguing, tense and even real funny at times with it's relieving comedy and characters in it.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Hillbilly slasher film, prescient in its presentation (perhaps), though no better as a production simply for being an early precursor to the Dead Teenager movie genre. Based on the 1946 "Texarkana Moonlight Murders", story follows the fruitless efforts of the Arkansas police force to trap and apprehend a hooded sadist who attacks, tortures, and often kills sweetheart-teens in parked cars. Ben Johnson, playing a no-nonsense Texas Ranger summoned in to lead the manhunt, is introduced to us as a legend, a man among men, yet his tactics don't seem any better than those employed by the local law. Narrated by Vern Stierman in somber tones (much like a "Twilight Zone" episode), the picture is a cheap and pedestrian piece of goods, unpleasant in the extreme, what with boys being clubbed over their heads and screaming girls crawling through meadows and corn-fields. Some of the point-of-view photography was ahead of its time, yet the handling in general is so awkward--and the victims are viewed so unsympathetically by the filmmakers--that indifference finally sets in. Without genuine suspense, the movie amounts to little more than target practice. *1/2 from ****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Generally, docudramas of sensational events like serial killings are really interesting because the events themselves and the motivations that prompt them are preposterous. The vast majority of homicides take place between people who are relatives or close friends. We can all understand that. Who can count the number of times we've wanted to murder our spouses and children and closest friends? Quick -- somebody gimme an axe. Why do we do it? Because we LOVE these people. They are in a position to hurt us badly because we care about their opinions of us. They make us vulnerable so naturally, when they take advantage of that position, we want to get rid of them. Or, to put it another way, you want to kill the thing you love. But -- strangers? Total strangers, whose view of us we don't know, and wouldn't care about if we DID know? Harmless aliens in our social worlds? We cannot put ourselves in their shoes.That's why mass murderers and serial killers attract such attention. Ninety percent of homicides may be simple outgrowths of our biological and cultural propensities -- but what is the deal inside these guys' heads? They're horrifying and fascinating at the same time, in the way that tornadoes and other acts of God are. They embody a kind of evil that we can't begin to comprehend.The Texarkana "Phantom" was something out of a modern slasher flick, with that flour bag over his head, puffing in and out with every loud and sibilant breath. It could have been gripping and enlightening too, but "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" blows its chance. It's poorly directed, photographed, acted, scored, and -- above all -- poorly written. Direction: Bad staging, with people standing around blocking one another. Confusing press conferences. Inexplicable slow-motion shots (very slow) inserted apparently at random. No on-the-set trimming of redundant or silly dialogue.Photography: What is this, color by Fuji? Garish fully saturated hues captured in shots that alternate between high-key lighting and shadows that are too dark. And when the motion is "slow", man it is slow, grindingly, boringly slow. The women (and the female impersonators) look like brightly made-up mannequins. The blood is neon red, and it's all over the place.Acting: This is probably the worst performance that Ben Johnson, a likable actor, has ever turned in. At that, he is head and shoulders above the rest of the crowd. Not to be harsh on the performers, but they all stink. Maybe Andrew Prine survives, though, since he has practically no lines.Music: In one scene a high-school band plays dance music on the stage. Like most high school bands they sound weak, tentative, and slightly out of tune. The entire score sounds like that. During the first "comic" scene, in which a driver forgets his car keys and must retrieve them while his passengers wait impatiently, there is a comic march tune to let us know this is supposed to be funny. The scene and the tune are equally funny but for the wrong reasons.Script: A member of that incompetent high-school band could have written it. I can't possibly cover all the gaffes. But watch the big scene where Ben Johnson, the famous Texas ranger arrives at the station. Count the number of times the phrase, "Thank you, sir," is used. They come so thick and heavy that I wasn't able to. Every other sentence consists of, "Thank you, sir." In the middle of all this fussy greeting, Johnson breaks off and walks over and buys some cigars, and says, "Thank you, sir," to the cigar vendor. (What is the point of his buying the cigars in the first place? It's an unnecessary break in an already confused expository scene.) I will mention just two other particularly irritating things, briefly. A character named "Sparkplug" is introduced to provide comic relief, or rather "comic" "relief." He's silly, not funny. He can't drive the car, which is his only assignment, and yet he's permitted to continue driving the car throughout the movie. The second thing is the Phantom's tromboning the girl to death. The girl, dragged from a car, is tied to a tree. The Phantom finds a discarded trombone, assembles it, ties a knife to the slide, and after a few warm-up glissandos on the chromatic scale, including one or two virtuoso quotes from Vivaldi's "Spring," he blows into the trombone and jabs the slide forward so that the knife pierces the girl's back. He takes a deep breath before each attack, but when he blows into the mouthpiece nothing emerges except a loud POOF. This guy is no Tommy Dorsey. It's too bad he was no Bob Brookmeier, otherwise he'd have been stuck with a valve trombone and the girl might have been spared. You don't really want to see this one. Trust me, but don't bother to thank me, sir.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good on the atmosphere, but lacking in action</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Supposedly based on actual events that took place in Texarkana shortly after the end of the First World War. The film takes on a documentary style, which is shown through the rather corny voice-over and is mixed with footage of a man in a hood bumping various youngsters off. Given that the film is based on a true story, this actually turned out to be a good way to film it; although those who are going into this film expecting a slasher along the lines of Halloween or Black Christmas are likely to be disappointed. The film plays out more like a profile of the serial killer, although since not much is known about the actual hooded maniac that terrorised Texas back in the forties, the film doesn't go too deep either. The film focuses more on the police and the local residents rather than the actual killer, and we follow the effect that the murder spree has had on the town, through both the residents' actions and the baffled police investigation into the crimes.The main strongpoint of this movie definitely lies in its atmosphere, and director Charles B. Pierce does well at ensuring that the fear of the locals always shines through. These is shown by having the local people board up their windows and buy all the weapons from the local gun shops, which in turn ensures that the audience is aware of both the killer's actions and their implications on the local townspeople. The director also does well at presenting the southern style to the film, as all the people speak with thick accents and it gives the film an element of realism. However, all this is well and good; but there's not enough action, and while this film stands out among real-life serial killer films thanks to the way that it shows the murders and their implications; there's not enough action, and at times the film can feel rather flat. The film could definitely do with a decent release also, as the copy that I saw was too dark during the night scenes and at times it was difficult to see what was going on. There's an element of slapstick comedy in the film as well, which makes it more entertaining...but I can't help but think it's rather inappropriate. Overall, this film is definitely worth seeing for the cult horror fan; but personally, I don't rate it as a classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Very disappointing proto-slasher flick.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Town That Dreaded Sundown" tells the mostly true story of a series of unsolved slayings in and near Texarkana during the first half of 1946.A young couples in the lover's lanes are stalked and killed by crazy wacko with a flourbag over his head.The police in Texarkana calls in Captain J.D.Morales,legendary investigator of the Texas Rangers."The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is a mediocre proto-slasher flick.The narration is mostly inept and there are plenty of boring and useless scenes.The attack scenes are well done and at least provide some tension.Death by trombone is particularly priceless.The film actually inspired the look of Jason Voorhees in "Friday the 13th Part 2".6 out of 10 and that's being kind.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Town that Dreaded Sundown is set in the small town of Texarkana in Arkansas in 1946 a mere eight months after World War II where two young lovers are brutally attacked by a large man with a sack over his head (Bud Davis), they are found the next morning barely alive. Deputy Norman Ramsey (Andrew Prine) is on the case, precisely three weeks later the killer who has become known as 'The Phantom' strikes again only this time his victims don't survive. Fear grips the town of Texarkana &amp; Texas ranger Capitan J.D. Morales (Ben Johnson) is brought in to co-ordinate the manhunt but will the Phantom be caught before he kills again?Produced &amp; directed by Charles B. Pierce, who also appears in the film as the annoying comedy relief deputy Benson, this is an early attempt at a teen slasher revolving around the real life Phantom murderer who killed five people &amp; injured many other's &amp; to this day his identity remains a mystery although one suspects with the forensic advances we have today if the same crimes were committed today he'd be caught. The script by Earl E. Smith unusually has large chunks of narration as what's going on is spelled out with no attempt to tell the story through proper storytelling or it's character's. I'm not sure how accurate this film is in it's portrayal of the real life crimes it depicts but I would have thought it isn't particularly faithful. I also found The Town that Dreaded Sundown extremely repetitive, the Phantom attacks then there's a large chunk of narration describing the facts &amp; then we see the local police going about their investigations &amp; this is basically how the entire film goes until the end where the Phantom escapes &amp; seemingly gives up his life of crime. Apparently the Phantom was never caught &amp; there were no obvious motives for his crimes although I don't really understand why he was walking around a sandpit with a potato sack over his head &amp; I'm sceptical about the historic accuracy regarding the end (the trombone bit never happened that's for sure). I'm not sure many will like the ending either as nothing is revealed or cleared up &amp; it just ends. The Town that Dreaded Sundown (I hate that title) feels like a slasher film as our killer chases &amp; murders screaming teens, I just felt it was so empty &amp; the comedy relief copper played by director Pierce as already noted who can't drive properly just feels very out of place &amp; awkward.Director Pierce does OK but why did he set the first two murders during the night &amp; then use day-for-night filming? It looks terrible &amp; someone should tell the filmmakers shadows don't appear during the night! The murder scenes aren't particularly gory although they are quite long &amp; fairly brutal for the time it was made, there's not much atmosphere &amp; I didn't think it was scary either. The period design &amp; setting is OK although it's noticeable that Pierce shoots in woods &amp; country roads where he can avoid anything that could place the film in the 70's rather than the 40's. The killers resemblance to Jason in Friday the 13th Part 2 is very apparent &amp; I'd be surprised if the makers of that hadn't been inspired by The Town that Dreaded Sundown.Technically the film is OK, there's no special effects as such &amp; it's well made I suppose. The acting is alright but nothing special, no-one seems that interested.The Town that Dreaded Sundown is an odd film, I'm not sure who it's meant to appeal to as horror fans will find it dull &amp; predictable with little horror or suspense while anyone looking for a accurate recreation of the real life events depicted will also be disappointed because this ain't it. It's watchable on a certain level but nothing I'd want to see again or am particularly fond of.</fullReview>
