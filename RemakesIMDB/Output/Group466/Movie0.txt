		<shortDescription>Good idea with some clichés</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some 60+ years since a serial killer left the town of Texaracana in fear the killer seems to be back for more, but one girl will stop at nothing to uncover his identity.This film is really intelligently shot, it mixes in several scenes from the original film while also creating some copycat scenes with different characters, I really enjoyed it. Good acting all around.That being said this lost a lot of likability with its death scenes, there are several characters with less then five minutes of screen time, yet they leave us thanking the killer for offing them. you'll notice the mpaa rating says it has strong sexual content, I'm not one to really complain about unneeded sex and nudity that being said the sex scenes were really used to degrade the characters.Overall this was a nice slasher film, fans of the sub-genre will enjoy it. Not a slasher fan? you should probably pass on it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fun Reboot/Sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many years after the killings in small town by a killer known as "The Phantom" resulted in the making of the 1976 film The Town That Dreaded Sundown, Texarkana is once again plagued by murders. Every Halloween, the town has a drive in screening of the original film depicting their own town. On this particular night, Jami (Addison Timlin) and her boyfriend Corey (Spencer Treat Clark) decide to bail on the film and go elsewhere. When they are attacked by an assailant dressed as The Phantom, Jami starts to suspect that history is about to repeat itself, and the new Phantom has certain plans for Jami and her small town.It is difficult to say whether this version of The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a reboot or a sequel. But whatever it is, it works. The original film had its creepy moments, but this film has a lot more going for it. For starters, this definitely has more of a slasher film feel to it than the original. We are given a very creepy killer, plenty of great and spooky night time scenes with him, plenty of chase scenes, and excellent and bloody kills. Not to mention it is VERY well- filmed with a great atmosphere and nice splicing between this and the original film. It also keeps you guessing as to what exactly is going on. Our leading lady played by Addison Timlin, while definitely isn't legendary as far as a Final Girl, but she's likable enough for us to root for her. And she has very sweet scenes with her grandmother, played by Veronica Cartwright. The acting isn't bad, but it's not anything great either. Timlin does well with the lead role, and easily does give the best and only note-worthy performance of the film. The concept itself is very interesting in how it is trying to bring new life the original film, and bring in a new generation. However, the concept does have a few problems. It bares a very strong resemblance to Scream 4 in trying to re-create the events of a real story/film in the film's world. In fact, there's a few things that can be compared to with Scream in regards to this film. The twist is another one of its weak spots. When it's revealed, it's not so much shocking as it is that you don't see much point to it.Despite the film's borrowing of ideas and strong resemblances to Scream/Scream 4 and the awkward twist, this reboot/sequel is ultimately a fun slasher film. Let's face it, there haven't been many good ones. So if you look for particular aspects in a slasher film like a creepy killer, chase scenes, a decent body count, and bloody kills, with a likable lead, you may just enjoy this. It doesn't take itself too seriously, which makes it all the more fun. My Rating: 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An interesting REQUEL!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original TTTDS was one of the earliest slasher films in the genre that even came before (in 1976) popular franchises like Halloween &amp; Friday the 13th and I've always been a fan of that flick for its humor, suspense &amp; docu-drama like narration style &amp; last but not the least the haunting ending. So when I first heard about there will be a new TTTDS, I thought it'd be another pointless, some cash-in effort but last night after watching this new take on T3DS, I'd like to admit...I was pleasantly surprised!!Directed by Alfonso Gomez-Rejon (the most frequent director of American Horror Story), this new film is a strange version to categorize as a remake, reboot or a sequel; actually it's neither a straightforward remake or sequel...I'm not sure but I think REQUEL (a sequel-ish remake!) can be a more appropriate term for it. After more than half a century of the actual events of The Moonlight Murders that resulted the very making of 1976 original film, this new story is set on present day at the same town, Texarkana that once again begins to plagued by "The Phantom" murders. Interestingly, the 1976 original film is also very much alive in this movie as a film that we know in our 'reality', as in the film the town now maintains a tradition in every Halloween to show a drive in screening of the original film. So, as the film progress we see a fine blend between this version &amp; the original film where some scenes from the original brought back through a kind of flashback style while also creating some copycat murder sequence in this new one. I liked this approach of providing homage to the original; bring it to an entirely new generation. This new &amp; refreshing kind of take &amp; treatment to this already known &amp; filmed story is the most appreciating part of this version. And overall the film is beautifully shot, liked the camera works, the character development was fine for a slasher flick, but still as a slasher it's not above the clichés as well as it comes with a routine ending &amp; weak motive for the killer which I couldn't find much point to it. And lastly there's another strange part of it and that's the Town itself! It looks like the town hasn't really age after all this years!! May be for the homage issue but though the film is set on late 2013, it still got the 70s vibe almost all over it.Anyway, there's not much masked killer-slasher flick comes out this days with good or decent budget &amp; film making like this one and still despite some clichés &amp; the ending, as a slasher flick it's pretty good one, IMO.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Slasher With a Difference</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Post-modern take on the 1976 film of the same title, which was based on a series of murders that occurred in Texarkana on the Texas/Arkansas border a few decades earlier. The first film is frequently referenced but setting the story aside, the two have little in common. The original could sit comfortably in the video nasty genre, while the 'remake' is a stylistic tour-De-force with sound and photography that give off an art film vibe. The acting is solid in part thanks to veteran character actors Ed Lauter Gary Cole (the arms expert in The Good Wife). Although using a few genre tropes, this is not your average slasher flick. It's a scary movie but not a Scary Movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Phantom Killer strikes again.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original true crime slasher flick "Town That Dreaded Sundown"(1976) directed by Charles B.Pierce was based on true story of a mysterious serial killer called the Phantom Killer,who during spring of 1946 killed five people and wounded three in a small border town of Texarkana.The perpetrator of these heinous crimes was never caught.The new "Town That Dreaded Sundown" remake plays more like "Scream" influenced modern teen slasher flick with plenty of references to the original movie and the Phantom Killer unsolved case.Addison Timlin plays teenage girl who after seeing her would-be boyfriend brutally murdered by masked maniac decides to find who really the Phantom Killer AD 2014 is.The movie-within-a-movie premise is certainly well-played and there are some gruesomely bloody kill scenes.Frozen in time Texarkana is also a nice touch.Unfortunately the final reveal of the killer is disappinting.7 trombone deaths out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70s inspired homage yet original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town that Dreaded Sundown is a fictional continuation on the story of the Texarkana Moonlight Murders told creatively to give homage to its predecessors.Based on the terrifying true serial killings known as the Texarkana Moonlight Murders of 1946, The Town that Dreaded Sundown (2014) is a continuation of the screen adaptation of the real murders told by 1976's horror film The Town that Dreaded Sundown.Texarkana is still affected by the gruesome lovers lane murders some sixty-five years after the burlap masked figure terrorized the Arkansas/Texas area. When the 1976 film The Town that Dreaded Sundown came out the town chose to embrace rather than conceal its gruesome history.The 2014 horror movie The Town that Dreaded Sundown is not a remake nor is it a sequel. The 2014 horror movie blurs the line between fact and fiction, paying homage to both the film and the real life murders, but from this point on is purely fiction.Jami, played by Addison Timlin, is at the annual drive-in showing of the classic 70's horror flick about her hometown's moonlight serial murders. She and her date venture off for more privacy and are brutally attacked seemingly but impossibly by the same suspected killer that plagued her town in the 40's. When it is evident a serial killer is once again threatening the people of Texarkana the Texas Rangers once again join the search for the identity of the perpetrator.Never having seen the 1976 film of the same name, I can not attest to the originality or compare it to the 2014 film. Having some knowledge of the Texarkana murders it seems as though screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa expertly parallels the real life killer's modus operandi and Earl E. Smith's fictional narrative as adapted in the 1976 film. Aguirre-Sacasa and director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon are very honest about and respect the tale's history and, in doing so, find the perfect balance in their film successfully.The Town that Dreaded Sundown keeps with its nostalgic past with an overall 70s vibe. The footage has a decidedly yellow tone reminiscent of popular horror films from the 1970s. The characters wear retro clothing despite the events portrayed in the film stated as taking place in 2013. Most importantly, the horror and gore is more implied, more often alluding to the violence rather than showing it, with the exception of the brutal and tense climactic showdown nearing its conclusion.The Town that Dreaded Sundown is a well orchestrated horror with superb actors and gruesome carnage for a slasher atmosphere. The film has plenty of characters and suspects for sufficient misdirection to keep audiences guessing and on their toes until the end.For more FULL reviews of RECENT releases, please check out our website.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Maybe we could jerk off together?"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The 1976 movie this is a 'sort of' remake of was a quirky, fun, low-budget horror film made by Charles B. Pierce. I realize it's not going to be to everybody's tastes but I'm a fan of it. I don't say that like the makers of this movie do. I actually mean it. They obviously don't mean it since they spend most of this insulting the people involved with the original film as well as the people of Texarkana, where the real events the original film was based on took place. At the point where they introduce a loser character based on real person (and son of the director of the '76 movie) Charles Pierce, Jr., I almost turned the movie off in disgust. I can't stand cheap stuff like that. If you don't have respect for the first movie or the people involved with it, screw you for exploiting that film to make a few bucks, you talentless hacks. Love all the random artsy camera angles, by the way. That doesn't scream "recent film school graduate" at all.Anyway, I stuck with this turd, not because I was enjoying the movie up to that point (I wasn't) but because it was almost over and I wanted to see just how bad it would get. The '76 movie has its detractors, and I admit it isn't perfect, but it was different and unique. This remake/meta-sequel (I give the finger to that stupid term) starts out promisingly enough but quickly becomes yet another post-Scream slasher where the pretty heroine with a tragic backstory investigates while everybody around her is killed. Everything is handled with a heaping dose of camp, thumbing its nose at the genre while using the same old tired tricks every standard slasher uses. Like being ironic somehow makes it less clichéd. Speaking of Scream, the movie doesn't miss an opportunity to rip that series off. From all the meta crap referencing the '76 movie to the virginal heroine giving it up to the guy she likes near the end, only to seemingly seal her fate with the killer. The ending also rips off Scream in a pretty obvious way. So this winds up being something that's more inspired by that series than anything Charles B. Pierce ever did.Addison Timlin is attractive and does fine but she pretty much lost me when she said with a straight face "I don't get asked out all that much." I got a good laugh out of that one. Only in Hollywood. I like her but this wasn't a good vehicle for her. The movie wastes many talented actors like Ed Lauter, Edward Herrmann, Gary Cole, and Veronica Cartwright. This is referred to in press as a '70s homage. I guess what that means is that, despite taking place today, there are people who dress like it's the '70s without explanation. Mixed with this is lots of modern stuff like an aggressive sex scene set to loud music, a couple of awkward gay guys debating going down on each other, and cheap bits of gore that the camera lingers on like they are impressive (they're not). The gay scene is particularly funny with laughable dialogue. The two actors didn't seem to know whether to play it straight or not (no pun intended). Anyway, this is a piece of crap. Avoid it and go watch the original. Warts and all it's at least entertaining, not insulting like this garbage. Oh, I totally buried the lead by talking about this crappy movie so much. The real news is Orion Pictures is back and using the same logo from the '80s.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unoriginal, Boring, And A Complete Waste Of Time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first word out of my mouth to my wife after watching this film was "lame" as that is exactly what this film is, not to mention boring, unoriginal, devoid of atmosphere, believability (even for a slasher film), and - in part - cheesy. Some of the dialogue was pretty cringeworthy as well (the gay scene and the "call me Lone Wolf" speech just to name two) so add that that into the mix with the other descriptions and you have yourself a lame film. Exactly what I said it was.Most movies that I've seen - even some of the bad ones - have usually started out OK or decently enough and have obviously either gotten better or worse as they have went on. The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a film that is in the latter section - it started off OK but it got worse as it went on, with boring &amp; unoriginal being the main reasons why. The story is just devoid of any real suspense or atmosphere as well, but it IS full of cliché's and even has very obvious similarities to another (MUCH better) film, especially the ending.Speaking of which....the "twist" at the end would have been more believable if it was thought out much better (and, of course, if it were not copied). I mean it was OK, but when you consider what happens earlier in the film, and you actually use a bit of brain power, then you'll find that it was a totally implausible, even for a crappy movie such as this.The whole look of the film was off for me as well. I mean it was made (and set) in 2014, but it looked as if it was set in the 70s...the older style of cars, the fashion, the retro look, etc...so whether that was an homage to the 1976 film or not I don't know, but it just didn't feel right at all.This film is just a bit of a mess really, so If you enjoy a good slasher movie, then do yourself a favour...avoid this one as it will be 1 hour 20 minutes of your life you won't get back.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I must agree with what many others say here: Lame, boring, very poorly acted, and Predictable...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was honestly going into this movie rather hopeful because I liked the premise and thought that it was a creative idea.But... as you can probably tell by my Summary, I REALLY did not like it very much. Mainly, I find that what really kills it for me personally with these Horror films is the poor acting. Now, I realize that in many cases like with your Classic Slasher films and your more campy ones, you EXPECT the characters to be kind of corny caricatures and such; that usually adds to the fun. BUT... when the 'effort', such as it is, is clearly being made to be serious and straight-forward, AND the acting is superficial and completely abysmal, it genuinely puts me right off the film (if you want, please check out my comments about the recent, AWFUL 'HONEYMOON' along these lines...)I really tried with this one, I truly did. But, almost from the start with the actresses phony tiny, little-girl voice, and the painfully OBVIOUS and PREDICTABLE scene at the funeral (GEEZ, never saw THAT coming *sarcastic*) and then the artificially soft, clichéd voice of the supposed 'Therapist', and even to my dismay, the absolutely TERRIBLE line readings from the well known Angela Cartwright... well, by then, I really had quite had it with this poorly done, horribly acted movie. Not to mention the pointless and tedious 'Sex' scenes that served no cinematic or filmic purpose whatsoever, unless HIGHLY amplified sucking and kissing sounds really get you off... And it was really sad too, because I was looking forward to seeing Ed Lauter's and Edward Herrmann's last performances.I don't know... Maybe I should have given it more of a chance. If the acting hadn't been so painfully cringe-worthy, I probably would have. Some people here clearly seemed to like the film like Scarecrow88, who's reviews are usually quite helpful. Maybe I am missing something... Perhaps if you are not as fussy about the acting aspect of films like I am, you might be able to go with the story, but I personally truly found it to be very trite, boring, and completely uninvolving in ANY way whatsoever...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most boring movies I've seen recently</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie starts off with a voice-over speaking about how what your about to see is based on a true story, which is all bs of course, in real life this movie is based on the 1976 movie with the same name which was indeed based on a true story, but only loosely.The characters in this movie are all fictional however taking place in current date and it's more of a sequel than it is a remake as the original movie play a big part in this movie in terms of it's legend and the fact that the first murder occur in a annual screening of the movie.All that really doesn't matter in the end I suppose as long as the movie entertains, which it really does not.It's incredibly boring (even the many sex-scenes in it are boring), and to say that it's filled with clichés is a understatement; THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN (2014) is a cliché first and a movie second.I actually expected a decent movie when I saw Anthony Anderson and Gary Cole was in it, but they are not in it all that much.Anthony Anderson who I personally think is one of the funniest comedians plays a serious role this time, and when I say serious I don't mean dramatic I mean that his sheriff character appears to have a stick up his butt and wouldn't know a joke if his life depended on it. Pure and simply he's boring as a piece of wood in this one, and has the charm of it as well.Gary Cole is not much better, he seems incredibly bored through out and that's all he does.But the rest of the (unknown) cast is not that much better.Okay music though but that doesn't help this uninspired waste of film whatsoever.If you like really boring horror movies with poor from point a to point b story telling and a cast that look like they'd rather go to Pizza Hut than to make this movie, then yeah maybe this is for you, if you prefer your horrors to entertain than watch something else.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well they sure managed to keep that old image from back then, thus giving this movie a more realistic look, helping the viewer connect easily with the story. I for one got to say that I enjoyed it!Am surprised to see a hand bunch of good actors gathered here, just check out the list, you'll see what I'm talking about, so you can expect good acting. They kept a very realistic portrait of the town, the people, the church, pretty much everything looks old, older than everything else because it is a tired town, one that has been through a lot of terror already and it barely healed properly. The story moves slow, but the killings go on and on, no gore, a little nudity, still powerful images come with every kill. Those looked indeed like authentic psychopath murders with psychopath reason behind them.I think I said enough, I don't wanna tip you off on anything so I'll just recommend you to try it. It's a good homage of the classic cinema. I haven't seen the original, I hear it is also quite brutal, probably I'll try that one too, soon enough I hope. So without comparing them, my opinion is that The Town That Dreaded Sundown stands tall for a horror/slasher remake.Cheers!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A not uninteresting post modern take on an old tale.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This 21st century version of "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" isn't really a remake, or a sequel. It fashions a fictional tale around the real life murders that plagued Texarkana (a town straddling the Texas and Arkansas borders) in the 1940s, and the subsequent film adaptation of those events by regional filmmaker Charles B. Pierce in the 1970s. Addison Timlin plays Jami, a high school graduate whose boyfriend is slaughtered by a masked psycho, approximately 66 years after the original murder spree. She becomes caught up in her hometowns' strange history, deciding to do some sleuthing of her own and thereby assisting the local police and a big shot Texas Ranger (Anthony Anderson).Filmed on location in Texarkana (and Shreveport, Louisiana), this turned out to be more entertaining than this viewer expected, if mostly because it's played commendably straight. This viewer was afraid that these filmmakers were going to be overly impressed with their own supposed cleverness, and get cute too often. This is more of a straight up slasher film (albeit one with a fairly limited body count) than docudrama, although it does quote one memorable moment from TTSD '77, and the characters do study that film hoping to come up with clues. It's slick (with some inspired touches here and there), and pretty damn violent, but some people in the audience are going to be left wanting more because there just ain't THAT much gore. Ultimately, it's too predictable to work very well, and falls right into that old trap of having our villain talk too much once revealed.It also makes a waste of some of its veteran talent. In addition to the cute Timlin, who's appealing enough to carry the story, there's Veronica Cartwright as her grandmother, Edward Herrmann as a priest, and Ed Lauter as a sheriff. Sadly, this was the final feature film for both Herrmann and Lauter, and they deserved better swan songs. Gary Cole gets precious little to do as one of Lauters' deputies. Denis O'Hare tends to steal the show, playing the real-life Charles B. Pierce Jr., with his own theory of who could be behind the killings. Anderson is no Ben Johnson, not by a long shot.The finale isn't very satisfying, but getting there is entertaining enough. At the very least, it's nice to see that logo sequence for the long defunct Orion Studios once again.Six out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Director Gomez-Rejon has serious skills</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Hate to tell the truth but whether or not you personally "liked" a film does not necessarily qualify you to review it.This reviewer was hosting horror festivals when the original NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD came out, and the hardest thing to do in a horror flick is be subtle.But this director has mad skills. And can do subtle.The framing in many of the scenes is incredible, there are times you almost feel the characters on-screen are the only people left on the face of the earth.And Gomez-Rejon also is shrewd enough to get more mileage out of Addison Timlin's face than a Prius.And a nice face it is. I counted over 50 closeups and then stopped counting. Her character is the glue, the connection, for this story and she is set up as a shy girl who (quote) never gets asked out.Which is why this story is fiction and not a documentary.And you the viewer get to watch the whole story through her eyes.The juxtaposition of the new movie and the "old movie" only makes my point -- putting this film alongside Whedon's Cabin in the Woods for cleverly deconstructing a tale from within the story arc itself.</fullReview>

Although the killer uses a gun a bit too much, and there's no decent death scenes in here, there's enough for slasher fans to give this a watch, I liked the way that pretty much as soon as the killer is revealed, unlike most other films where they talk or chase each other for another half an hour, this one just concludes pretty sharpish. has a bit of a surprise at the end... makes no sense, but might be a pleasant surprise for people who spend the whole film guessing who the killer is.it's no scream, but if you like one you'll like the other</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Starts off with promise, but is ultimately bogged down by heavy clichés...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Going into this, I was expecting a remake, but it actually plays out as more of a sequel/follow-up to the 1976 original. I'm getting kinda tired of non-remakes being given the same title as their predecessor just because some time has gone by - i.e. "The Thing" prequel from a few years back. It's just a confusing and stupid way to cash in. Anyways... This flick is just heap of wasted potential - dragged down by the 'modern' teen-horror influence.According to this movie, the small town of Texarkana - famous for the real-life unsolved series of slayings from 1946, known as The Texarkana Moonlight Murders - has since embraced the legendary case of the Phantom Killer. They even have an annual screening of the original film, which, after 66 years, sparks a presumed copycat killer who is taking to lover's lanes and brutally killing local teens. One girl survives her attack and decides to investigate the mysterious Phantom Killer and the main suspects, as well as certain information that was apparently dug up for the making of the '76 film...Early on, it looked like this one was gonna be decent enough with some pretty strong kill scenes and creative camera work. Also, the whole set-up showed some promise - particularly, the movie-within-a- movie angle, which was somewhat interesting. These 'positives' are virtually obliterated by the exhausting abundance of clichés and painfully boring characters. Seriously, the male and female leads seemed to purposely be cast for their ungodly deadpan demeanor's and inability/refusal to captivate an audience. And the icing on the cake of sh*t that killed this flick was the p*ss-poor conclusion that goes out of it's way to be a random, over-explained 'whodunnit' reveal. The dreaded "Scream"-influence rears it's ugly head again and really just extinguished any flicker of aptitude this movie had going for it, as far as I'm concerned. I'm not even a huge fan of the original "Town That Dreaded Sundown", but you should definitely stick with that film (cuz Mary Ann is in it, of course...) and don't bother with this.More of my reviews at http://swinesewage.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are some scenes here that are truly awesome and really entertaining. Despite the clichés, some of the death kills and chases are well done and pretty inventive (although having not seen the original, not sure how inventive after all). The acting is decent, and it really feels like an old-school slasher, for obvious reasons. The problem is that it tries to get into the backstory a little too much, ultimately deflating so much of its momentum. Its first act is definitely its strongest, what a shame it couldn't sustain itself. For horror fans, it's somewhat decent and maybe many will love it. But it does show some talent from Gomez-Rejon, who has proved to be the best director of American Horror Story</fullReview>

This movie about a town has long history of legendary slasher or serial killer didn't get caught and not clue he died or still alive till today or a ghost. Then at the year 2013, pop up a new killer say himself is the legendary slasher wish slaughter any person who he encounter at night without any mercy. Only 1st murder scene, a woman survive from been murder. She is the main character of this movie and very good acting also. Lastly, please enjoy it and enjoy watching it with your girlfriend.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No match for the original, but better than I expected</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Two thirds of a century after a series of brutal, vicious, and unsolved killings took place in Texarkana, Arkansas, and one film, loosely based on the crimes, was made, another killer begins making the rounds, using the original killer's M.O. Not really a remake, as it does have an original take on the story, and not exactly a sequel, either, as the characters are aware of the previous film's existence, and even turn to it for clues to the killer's next move, this meta-film has an interesting idea, and much more tension and suspense than I had expected. The hooded killer stalking his victims is effectively chilling, and just when it seems to begin copying the cornfield scene from the original, it does something a bit different with it, and gives the audience a creepy scarecrow image, not present in the earlier film.It mixes fact with fiction, as an article is being written about the killer, and a previously unknown victim, which could provide a clue to the killer's identity.But for all those things working in its favour, the characters are mostly dull, bland, and boring, the cinematography is typical high contrast with over saturated colours, and while the final chase is effective, the reveal of the killers' identity was uninspired and unbelievable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every year in Texarkana they play the 70s movie The Town that Dreaded Sundown to remember the horrible killings in the 50s.A young couple decides to leave the movie early because the girl, Jami, doesn't really like horror movies. They go to some desolate road where they make out. Then a guy who looks like the killer from the real life events/movie shows up. He basically just has some cloth bag over his head. He ends up killing the kid but lets the girl live so that everyone will remember Mary. Mary was one of the victims from the 50s.The killer kills some more people always showing up at the unlikeliest times and places. There's a joint Texas/Arkansas task force designated to track down the killer but it doesn't accomplish much. Jami who has some more similar run-ins with the killer is assigned a deputy Sheriff to guard her. At some point she decides to investigate the 50s murders to see if something was overlooked. She gets help from a guy who likes her and they actually develop some good leads.Jami was also accepted by various colleges so her family decides it's time to move to California. But the killer won't let that happen.The Town That Dreaded Sundown has all the elements of a great slasher--a better-than-average story, the lovely Addison Timlin, who doesn't look as lovely here, violence, gore, sex, nudity. What it doesn't have is a good director nor writer. This crew doesn't have a clue how to film a horror movie. There's are no thrills here, no suspense, no sense of dread. Timlin's character doesn't make a convincing lead. The film focuses way too much on her, instead of the law enforcement operation, for instance which doesn't serve any purpose here. This movie does become a whodunit eventually. One of the rules of a whodunit is that the players have to be known, that what makes it effective. The Town That Dreaded Sundown cheats the audience and it does so in two ways. So not even the end is satisfying. And certainly the way to get there isn't because it moves in a crawl and doesn't manage to get us involved or interested. This movie is a royally wasted opportunity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I like the fact, that for once they don't remake a movie, but they sort of make a sequel of it. And you really don't need to know the original movie to enjoy this. Though I reckon if you've seen a couple of Wes Craven movies or horror movies in general you may see certain things coming. But it's not about predictability or that this indeed is a slasher movie in contrast to the original.Now I understand that there are too many flaws for some people to overlook. The story isn't really new, it's a bit slow and the ending might give you a headache. Not to mention it does not make that much sense (motivation etc.) and might stretch a couple of things just to go for twists. Still it has it's moments and if you like slasher movies, you will get something out of this</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It has creative deaths</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A town that sits between Arkansas and Texas had a spell of killings nearly sixty-six years ago. This town is named Texakana and the killer was known as the Phantom. The Phantom suddenly reappears and vows to make the killings continue until the town remembers his legacy. The movie plays out in grisly fashion and has a few creative deaths along the way (knife attached to a trumpet). The main heroine, or the tormented in this case ? watches people around her die as she tries to get to the bottom of things. The killings are so bad that the "Texas Rangers" are called on the scene to investigate. I can't help but thing the heroine is similar to "Cindy" from the "Scream" series, only as more of a token and one shot character. The movie really does center more around the antagonist, "The Phantom" and it is almost too bad that the movie doesn't take place around his point of view instead.The movie is creative, and some of the scenes leading up to, and the deaths themselves, are creative. The movie is worth watching if you are a horror buff ? it is typical slasher affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never expect too much from horrors however, this has a certain stylish élan that raise it above the crowd. Set in Texarkana some 65 years after the town was devastated by a serial killer who only struck his victims at night ? this was the Phantom or 'The Moonlight Killer. Since the making of a controversial film depicting the crimes the events have become more notorious. Then on the anniversary of his first killings he comes back... mwah etc.Only this time The Phantom wants a certain victim to tell the truth about what really happened all those years ago or he will keep on killing the hapless inhabitants. Problem is no one actually does know what really happened so how to stop him? Now this is surprisingly good. The blood and gore is there but not a splatter fest, nor is it 'torture porn', it gets the point (forgive the pun) across that being killed is far from being a red letter day.Maybe a mild plot spoiler later on!!It is all well acted with some performances that stand up to be noticed ? like Travis Tope ('Boardwalk Empire') playing Nick and Anthony Anderson playing the fabulously named 'Lone Wolf Morales'. It also has high production values that are only let down by ? what I felt ? was a pretty lame ending. It did try so not a huge disappointment. This is one where the journey is the value and the final destination not all it promised in the brochure ? despite that I would still recommend this well made and entreating film. You may never look at a sensor motion light in the same way again though.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>''65 years after a masked serial killer terrorized the small town of Texarkana, the so-called 'moonlight murders' begin again. Is it a proverbial copycat or something even more sinister?''First contextual lesson I learned is that 'Texarkana' is absolutely nothing occult, but simply a hint that the town runs on the border between Texas and Arkansas. Nicely presented lesson for those far away from USA.At start the movie made me remember a book named 'World of Darkness - Slasher' which role-plays serials, from mortals to undying, ever- returning dread-legends. Perspective clouded like that I contemplated an Avenger type of serial, who had earned his reincarnation by punishing the soulless, bleak personalities all overcompensating it with sex. Teenage carnal- craze and nymphomania meeting their nemesis. Of course I was proved wrong, but if I would be a screenplay writer I would have my own variant to beg with at kick-starter now... ;-)Bonus Star 1: I rated higher, for the movie is flawless in the background and setting it does present. It is simple, like a backwater area where not too much did change or progress since the original 70's. Still it does so convince with it that one could instantly imagine a vacation there. Therefore a plus for atmospheric workout.The mentioned bonus one made me theorize that there is no serial, but a town populace smart enough to get rid of their pests. Kinda: We endured you until you finally joined the army, but now you came back and we have to get into that old serial costume once again... would have been a twist I could live with.Bonus Star 2: The only narcissist pests in the entire movie were either used for story-purposes or butchered with less than a minute on screen! That alone means the movie deserves all stars ever given to any faked-footage and similar brain-dung dished as a movie.The couple meeting at the airport (or train station) enters a cheap motel, has some loveless quick sex and is butchered before spoiling the movie. Skilfully avoiding the freakish to dominate the intended story!The unshaven, pale yokel lurking until he finally gets laid with the female protagonist of the movie was kept from dominating the story as well. Former Sheriff Lucas Buck (G. Coleman) humorously playing a different kind of lawman here was worth a chuckle, too. I hint at an old TV series named 'American Gothic'. In the movie he gets shot while receiving a b.low-job, leaving it only to my lack of skill that I add no pun about cum-shots.The movie is NOT very special, the movie is NOT innovative, neither is the movie UNIQUE. If you are in need for such go look elsewhere.The real strength of this movie, as many reviewers noted before me, is that it is SOLID. It is a well-done movie among all the freaky and crappy stupor dished since the nineties of last century made USA go insane in their mix of egomania and self-pity-f*ck 9/11. The movie has no exceptional strength, but avoids more mistakes and failures than any movie my own 'Splatter &amp; Slasher' specialist ever dished at me. The final twist is so crappy, that it DOES spoil a lot, if you are too weak to uphold your own fantasy. I did not fail on that, I am just too retarded to write a good screenplay-alternate. ;-) Oh, and the pedagogue bonus of the quite sexy female protagonist going to finish university is a GOOD real-life reminder to all who were knocked out of the first way upward in society. Finish the freak- show or purgatory called your own life's problems, and then go back to graduate, it IS better than enduring poverty until it finishes you or me off. I had been urban homeless, it is no fun &amp; freedom...</fullReview>

		<fullReview>my feelings about this film is split. On one hand you have a decent film which tells a story about a serial killer, then you have a film (which may or may not be intentionally funny) which is a splatter gore fest. The majority of this film is good to watch when nothing else is on, but that is the problem. This film is at most times pretty tedious to battle through. Some moments seem clever and smart, but other moments seem rather unamusing and not at the least bit entertaining.The Town That Dreaded Sun Down is at times fun to gloss over, but at times also hard to watch due to its prolonged scenarios. Not much of this film screams "this is worth watching", however at times the plot drifts off into a pretentious overdrive. Netflix supplied this to me, and being one of the last horror films for me to watch, was not a good one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A remake of a film that acknowledges the original's existence (and even implies it what an insensitive film to make) - now there's an interesting idea. Or at least a bold idea. It's not the first film to have done it, I know 'The Human Centipede II (Full Sequence)' in 2011 played around with the same concept and I'm certain it would have been done before that. For some reason though it just leaves a bit of a sour taste in my mouth. It's like a different form of breaking the fourth wall. If you acknowledge the existence of film inside a film that's fine, it obviously happens all the time. But to directly acknowledge the series of films you are currently making just cheapens the whole experience and makes me wonder why I should care. To be fair though the film itself didn't really make me care anyway.The whole thing is a bit of a mess. The victims are stupid, the cops are possibly even dumber and the kills feel rushed and never go on long enough to build any real suspense. Numerous times we are introduced to characters only moments before their imminent death. There are two flaws with this, one being that we can be certain that they are going to be victims because suddenly out of nowhere they have been awkwardly brought into the film like lambs to the slaughter, and secondly because we couldn't care less for the characters. We have no connection with them. Similar films like 'Scream' at least put some time and effort into the one scene their victim may have in an attempt to make us feel compassion for the character. That one scene can be enough if done right, but it certainly wasn't here.The 'whodunnit' side of things is done well enough, I certainly didn't pick it. That's really about all this has going for it though. They really kept the runtime short at 86 minutes. I feel even another five minutes could have done the world of good just to extend some of the kill scenes and build characters a fraction more. It's certainly not unwatchable, but in a genre that has been quite stale for a while now is this adding anything new? I wouldn't have thought so.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rather enjoyed this little horror movie. It had a fittingly very low budget texture in its low budget look, it's almost completely unknown cast were to a player pretty spot on, the tension quite well drawn out and the gore not to overt while all along rather cleverly i thought referencing both the 1946 actual Texarkana murder mystery and interweaving snippets of the 1976 grind-house original movie that i saw back in 1977 as the first half of a horror double bill at a long demised third run former silent era cinema here in the UK. I remember little of that movie and i have not seen it since but that film did make a impact on me, as my records show i gave it 4 out of 5 stars in my lifetime movie going journal. Now by the way well into a sixth decade.I saw this new version just after enduring the latest serving of the Marvel Avengers at my local multiplex and the new "Town That Dreaded Sundown" seeming like a masterpiece well at least it was a real film after 142 minutes of video game era noise which only sends me to sleep and it did. The new "Town That Dreaded Sundown" is a very pert 84 minutes and much the better for it.The cheap and creative low budget however had me purring like a pussy cat. American cinema does live after all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...is this meta-horror or an original plot? Is this a remake or reboot? I don't think the creators were able to decide, so they did a little of everything and the plot suffers. That being said, the camera work was excellent and the acting was above par for most teen slasher fare. Had the writer just committed to one storyline and not borrowed so heavily from the original and Scream this would have been an enjoyable flick. Most of the time I would say only check it out if you're a fan of the genre, but in this film case it would probably be much more enjoyable to someone new to horror who is not familiar with all the clichés. So, if you are new to horror and haven't seen the original check it out, otherwise I would suggest you steer clear of this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Two things they attempted here, one is the usual slasher where a skulking presence moves about in the small town after dark, haunting the whole of space. It offers up the blood sacrifice the genre demands, the Texan locations are nice, a sparse setting for the knife to slash.But they also had the ambition to not just redo the same horror as every other thing on the shelf but to layer that stage where horror unfolds so that we get the mechanisms that give rise to it. This is a sequel of sorts to the 70s film by the same name that was about the real Texarkana murders that shook the place in the 40s.So this becomes layered here as events unfolding in a place where gruesome reality of that day is relived each year through fiction, re-entered, thus neutered, through fiction; the original film playing on a drive-in on Halloween night as this one begins. The events aim to relive the original murders so that forgetful spectators will remember again the real impact, this at the behest of a new murderous narrator who fastidiously restages the real thing around town.The heroine is chosen by him - as the narrative demands - to be the first victim who survives to tell the story, herself an aspiring journalist looking to document truth. So she finds out that it's all happening because a part of the original narrative was omitted in the telling, not given its place in the fiction.So this is more ambitious than its ilk. One obvious source is Scream. A less obvious is Citizen Kane (don't jeer). The camera tries to swoop into rooms like Welles had it do, there's Kanesque deep focus, even that a journalist is looking to piece together truth from narration we might see as not wholly accidental.It's not enough to understand Welles as technique he mastered or topics he illustrated though. You must now what for. The filmmaker doesn't so we get obtrusive technique, structure without narrative depth, views without import, in the end it's all strung together in a film schoolish way, and this goes back and even ruins the slasher and sense of place. It ends with one of the most inane twists.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I thought seeing the title that it would have been a remake of the 1976 flick but it isn't at all. But I must say that the way it was shot and edited that the connection with the original one was made. If you haven't seen the original one don't worry because due narrating and showing pieces of the original one you will catch up what happened in the town back in the 40's. To be straight, it really happened back then. The only connection here with the real events is the fact that it's all about Mary (who survived the Phantom killer, talking about Mary Jeanne Larey).What I can say that again this flick will be hated or will be loved but I liked it very much because it's a real throwback to the eighties in the way it was shot and edited. And the killings were really gory and some you just don't see coming. To be honest I even would call it a slasher because it do has all elements, the gore, the POV's, the nudity, the heroin. Clever flick that's what I can say and it will shock a few who think that this would be just a normal flick about a serial or a remake. Really nasty this one.Gore 2/5 Nudity 1,5/5 Effects 3/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0/5</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Had potential but ends up as your usual cheesy, predictable slasher- murder-drama.The Town That Dreaded Sundown had some potential early on. By referring to an actual series of murders that occurred in the Texarkana, TX area in 1946 and an actual movie made in 1976 regarding these murders, you have the situation of an historic event within an actual movie within this movie. This made me think we were in for some sort of Christopher Nolan-like mind games.Alas, no.The historic event is just used to create a precedent and the 1976 movie hardly features beyond the opening scenes.While there is some ongoing intrigue regarding who the murderer is, the movie hardly develops into a decent murder mystery. Pretty much ends up following the standard slasher-horror formula, with the conclusion being rather random, contrived and implausible.Performances are of the usual so-so standard of horror movies. Worst of the lot is the one kid who mumbles his way through several scenes and heaps of dialogue.Gary Cole is the only known name in the cast, and he's just there to give the movie credibility.</fullReview>

The only thing in this movie good was cinematography - there are some truly good shoots, and overall cinematography is very good, much better that the material itself.Overall, "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is OK flick for some one viewing if you have seen better genre's flicks and you have absolutely nothing else to do.

		<fullReview>This is based loosely on a horrific event that took place in Texarkana in about 1947, when a masked killer, dubbed Moonlight Murderer, brutally killed a couple on lover's lane. This movie is not truly a sequel or remake; it is set in current time and referring to its predecessor as a movie. Every Halloween for the last sixty-some odd years, somewhere in Texarkana is a showing of a movie called The Town That Dreaded Sundown, depicting what had happened that night the town was terrorized. On Halloween night, as the movie is being shown at a local drive-in, Jami(Addison Timlin)and her date Corey(Spenser Treat Clark) leave early to go "parking". They are attacked by a man with sack over his head. Corey is murdered while Jami escapes to tell the story. After a few more teens are slaughtered, Jami delves into a deep investigation of the original killing. Texarkana is once again terrorized by a masked killer...but how could this be the same man? Maybe his own son or family member.This is just like the "good old days" watching a psycho with a burlap bag covering his face as he slices and dices teens in the process of planning fornication. It surprised me when a gay couple was slain. That doesn't happen very often. The radio evangelist Reverend Cartwright(Edward Herrimann)sure makes a great suspect. The finale is tense and scary.Also in the cast: Veronica Cartwright, Gary Cole, Joshua Leonard, Anthony Edwards, Ed Lauter and Andy Abele as Sackhead.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A problematic but solid remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The original The Town That Dreaded Sundown has become a cult classic over the years, but I found it to be rather underwhelming with some serious tonal shifts. Now we have a remake of the movie that also serves as a sequel as well with some touches of a prequel. Sounds like a handful, but it pulls it off rather successful despite some issues here.Good: This movie thankfully has a better tone compared to the original with a consistent tone of menace throughout. The main draw of the movie is the direction which features plenty of interesting use of colors and weird camera angles that make every frame interesting and beautiful to look at. I really like the premise of the movie that combines a remake with a sequel and provides some great meta moments that don't knock you over the head with. The main actress here does a good job as the final girl and the killer is appropriately intimidating. There's also some nice callbacks to the original including some of the kills.Bad: The movie isn't as scary as it wants to be despite some great chase sequences. There's also a love interest here that isn't that interesting and the final twist is pretty stupid that makes no sense whatsoever.Overall, it's a good slasher movie with great visuals, but it offers anything new or memorable.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Jami is out with Cory - her boyfriend - watching the annual showing in Texarkana of The Town That Dreaded Sundown. She tells him she doesn't like those sort of movies, and so they leave. Cory parks the car and the two start kissing when Jami sees some hooded person in the forest watching. They stop and are about to leave when they get attacked. Over the course of the next few days, quite a few people are butchered, and the religious town's folk think it's the killer from the actual 1946 murders, while others think it's a copycat killer.Even though the 1946 murders are brought up quite a lot, this movie is not based on that, nor is it a remake of the movie from the 1970s or early 1980s. There is nudity in this. Some blond girl shows her butt and breasts while having sex. There is a lot of blood, and there are two scenes of bodies chopped up by railroad tracks. It's a very formulaic slasher, but I thought it was certainly better than a lot of the indie horror movies out there, which are generally crap. As I said in my thread starter, this was pretty fun until the ending, which was stupid; it kind of reminded me of Scream, so take that for what it's worth.The lead actress was pretty good, as was the rest of the supporting cast. I gave this a 5-star rating. That ending prevented me from giving it more stars, because...the ending really was stupid, along with the reason this all took place.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The original 1976 "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" ranks as one of my favorite crime-dramas and horror films for its brilliant use of docudrama-style narration and editing, as well as its completely terrifying portrayal of an innocent town rocked by inconsistent and senseless murders, sending residents into a panic. In addition, the film combines my obscure interest of murders and murderers and fuels them into a film that works well under many different genres. The film profiled the mysterious murders by someone known only as "The Phantom Killer," who, for three solid months in 1946, terrorized the town of Texarkana, right on the border of Texas and Arkansas, committing gruesome murders or vicious attacks on the backroads of "lovers lanes." To this day, "The Phantom's" identity has never been confirmed and many believed that he walked the streets of Texarkana until his assumed death.The new, 2014 film bearing the same name is less a remake or a reboot of the original cult film but more a strange, meta-sequel, concerning present-day Texarkana, a distinctly southern town that still has the blemish of The Phantom clear in its history. Once a year, on Halloween, the town shows the original 1976 film at a drive-in theater, only this year the showing incites another masked assailant, who is going around committing gruesome murders eerily similar to those decade ago. A high school-age girl named Jami (Addison Timlin) is the first to encounter the second Phantom Killer after witnessing her boyfriend being brutally murdered by him in a woodsy area on Halloween night. Now, Jami and another close friend attempt to track down the history of the original Phantom Killer, right down to the son of Charles B. Pierce, the director of the original "Town That Dreaded Sundown," in order to optimistically garner answers about the current Phantom Killer.There are two issues with "The Town That Dreaded Sundown," both relatively minor in the broad spectrum, but worth mentioning as they are readily apparent. For starters, the film immediately loses the impact brought on by its predecessor because, in 1976, when the film was made, it was pragmatic to think that the man who committed the murders in 1946 would still be alive today, walking the streets of Texarkana. With that in mind, the film was an effective piece of work, resurrecting the ideas about the killer that were chilling to recall. The new "Town That Dreaded Sundown" obviously doesn't bear that same resonance, and, in addition, has an issue with the way it wants to show its town. The lingo, the look, and the feel of Texarkana in this particular film are all evidently modern, but the vehicles used could all be dated back to the seventies and beyond. Either Texarkana is a down that doesn't really age (which could very well be the case) or the true time period wasn't taken into full consideration.Other than that, "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" is a surprisingly effective sequel, informative enough to be considered a worthy piece of analysis into The Phantom Killer, dark and haunting enough to live up to the standard set forth by its predecessors, and not meta or self-referential enough to be a distraction or an annoyance. The film, like the 1976 film, understands its story and takes it seriously, and has no issue making the film dark and commendably frightening. Compare the murder scenes in this film to the murder scenes that took place in the original film, both of which made effective by the lack of music and their emphasis on realism. This particular film has no quibbles about making its murder sequences violent and horrifying, with one particular sequence at a hotel being entirely effective thanks to how much it wants to show and how gruesome it wants to be.Even with all the violence and gruesomeness occurring, "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" still slows down to adhere to the story's history, even expanding beyond it in subjective realms that we truly question to be true or not. Scenes like the ones featuring a long conversation with Pierce's son, who is obsessive about letting the truth be known about The Phantom Killer, leave a little bit of ambiguity to a story already so peculiar and odd that we wonder if what is being examined has any substance to it outside of the screenplay.Director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon made probably the best thing that could've resulted from a continuation to the 1976 film's story, and, through dark direction and an uncompromising notion to depict brutality and horror in its most chilling sense, makes "The Town That Dreaded Sundown" a thoroughly enjoyable and enticing affair.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had assumed that The Town That Dreaded Sundown 2014 was simply a remake of the 1976 slasher of the same name; this, I am glad to say, is not the case?it's a bit cleverer than that.The film is set in the small town of Texarkana, where a masked psycho known as The Phantom committed a series of vicious murders 65 years earlier?it is these killings that provided the inspiration for the original movie, which?in this film?is now a cult favourite amongst the town's teenagers. It is during a screening of the film that young couple Jami (Addison Timlin) and Corey are attacked by someone dressed as the Phantom. Corey (Spencer Treat Clark) is repeatedly stabbed in the back, but Jami manages to escape to tell the tale.Over the next few days, The Phantom claims several more victims; meanwhile, Jami investigates the history of the original murders (with help from archivist Nick, played by Travis Tope) in the hope of shining some light on the identity of the current killer.A little bit meta, this plot is intriguing enough to help distinguish it from all of the other remakes/re-imaginings/sequels that have plagued the horror genre in recent years, but the film also delivers the basics?scares, gore and nudity?making it a fun way to spend an hour and a half. The scares are sparing, but well executed; the death scenes are sufficiently nasty, with some nice and bloody effects, including the surprisingly graphic sight of a major character cut into several pieces; unfortunately, despite having a sex scene, star Timlin fails to flash the goods, leaving it to a blonde bimbo to do the honours during a motel romp.The final act, which relies on a very improbable twist, is something of a disappointment given all that has gone before, but overall I had a good time with this film. Time to revisit the original, methinks?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I vaguely remember having watched The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976) many years ago, but the only things I remember about it are the trombone murder and the absurd sense of humor the films directed by Charles B. Pierce used to employ (my favorite one from his filmography is Boggy Creek II: And the Legend Continues..., which I remember more clearly, because I have watched it approximately 10 times). So, I started watching The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014) without any nostalgic obstructions... and I liked it pretty much due to its sophisticated manufacture and narrative ingenuity. In fact, I wouldn't consider it a remake, but a kind of post-modern re-imagination which doesn't only recognize the existence of the original film, but also employs its fame and archetypes to enrich the narrative. In order to explain myself better, I will summarize the first scenes: in late- 2013, the main character and her boyfriend are watching the annual exhibition of the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown (1976) at a Texarkana drive-in cinema, during the anniversary of the real-life murders from 1946. She feels uncomfortable watching the horrors on the screen because she still suffers the consequences of having violently lost her parents while being a child. So, he suggests her to go anywhere else, and she accepts. Unfortunately, that place ends up being a "lovers lane", in which they find a sinister hooded figure, exactly like the one they saw in the film... and well, things quickly get worse. That ingenious combination of fiction, reality and meta-fiction characterizes the creative screenplay, which gets the important aid of the solid direction from Alfonso Gómez-Rejón, who employs a polished visual style supported by an extraordinary cinematography, exotic visual compositions and unusual camera angles. Sure, the style occasionally stands out more than it should, and it's not always compatible with the horror the film pretends to inspire us, but after having watched so many (SO MANY!) horror films which pretend to be rough or "grunge", it was very pleasant to find such a polished and well shot movie. On the other hand, it's possible that all that ornament and artistic chervil will be disliked by the fans of more traditional horror. That's a valid point of view, but personally, I found The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014) quite an interesting alternative which complements its images with a clever screenplay, built around a solid mystery with the obligatory suspects, false clues and unexpected twists (which aren't very original, but are well implemented). And we also have a competent performance from Addison Timlin as the "final girl" (and "initial girl" also, thinking it well), which is well complemented by the credible works from Gary Cole, Veronica Cartwright and the late Edward Herrmann and Ed Lauter. In conclusion, I think I can recommend The Town That Dreaded Sundown even to those who don't usually visit the horror genre, because it feels more like a thriller which occasionally employs the horror tools (bloody murders, masked villains) in order to bring more forcefulness to the experience, without betraying the spirit of both genres.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not quiet as good as the first film, but is a real treat for horror fans!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this fictional sequel to to Charles B Pierce's THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN, the original film was based on the true life case of the "Phantom Killer" who struck a small Texarcana town a year after the end of the second world war. The film opens with a screening of the 1976 film at a local drive inn, attended by by scores of youth, who turn up every year to see it &amp; experience it's towns dark past. However High school girl Jamie Lerner isn't so taken in by the film &amp; asks her date if he wouldn't mind ditching the film. Both kids then drive off town a quiet, desolate woodsy trail to spend some alone time together, only to be attacked by a vicious maniac, that bears a striking resemblance to the man seen in Pierce's film. He brutally stabs the boyfriend to death but lets the heroine go, so that she can explain to the town of his motive to strike fear once again into the town. Investigating her dates murder &amp; why the Phantom keeps contacting her &amp; leaving her messages, Jamie does her research on the original Phantom case &amp; just who this psychopath might be, with the help of a friend she meets, they even go so far as to visit Pierce's son (a fictional character based on a real life person) who drops some tid bits &amp; idea's as to who the killer might be &amp; why he has decided to strike. She soon discovers that the killer is attempting to re-create the death sequences seen in the original 1976 film (it should be noted that sometimes during or after the kill sequences, the film flashes back upon similar deaths seen in the original movie) only with a much more violent &amp; sadistic touch to them. THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN was a really nice surprise, I admit as a genre fan myself I was just about set to give up on the horror genre &amp; turn in my horror movie fan membership card, especially since all the horror films that are getting made today are nothing more than soulless PG-13 remakes to films that didn't need to be remade in the first place, possession films, endlessly bad &amp; boring found footage films, or another entry in the countless worn out zombie genre, which is the only types of horror movies Hollywood &amp; all indie film-makers seems to be making those days. However once in a while a film will come along that changes all that &amp; makes you restore you're faith in the genre. Such as this film, which I actually enjoyed quiet a bit. The film is certainly well acted &amp; directed, with director ALFONSO GOMEZ-REJON delivering a series of cool tracking shots &amp; camera angles to help make the film stand up &amp; above most point &amp; shoot text book style set ups that a lesser film-maker would have settled on, the camera hardly sits still &amp; is forever moving. Director Rejon also gives the film a hazy, rather dream like quality to the proceedings. The film also thankfully doesn't skimp out on all the gory goodies either, as unlike the original film, this film is very unapologetic in terms of the heavy amounts of gore &amp; inventive kills on display, as gore/horror fans are treated to some rather brutal kills, vicious, bloody gun shot wounds, a bone snapped out of flesh, a severed head that is used to smash open a window, a bullet through the eye, vicious stabbings &amp; blood splatter &amp; even goes a step further than the original film by showing some nudity &amp; despite claims to the contrary, this film is entirely fiction &amp; not based on a real life case the original film was. In fact I felt that's what made this sequel very fresh, witty &amp; inventive in it's own right. It takes a rather interesting idea &amp; goes all the way with it, full tilt. The set up &amp; premise is simple: What if someone took their love for a certain slasher film one step to far, wanting to emulate their idol by dressing &amp; acting like said villain &amp; trying to recreate the kills &amp; murder scenario's seen in said movie? Or what if fate were different &amp; the murder spree the Phantom went on by in 1946 happened now? if he were alive today instead of back then, how different would his approach be in terms of his attacks &amp; how he sets up those kills? The film also cleverly includes many real life facts about the case that many fans who seen the original might be very surprised &amp; interested to know about.That said I will say there were somethings about this sequel that I felt weighed it down a bit, the Phantom killer seen in the original, never talked once, while this one does &amp; I felt that made him effectively less creepy &amp; the climax, while certainly clever &amp; a nice twist to throw audiences off, felt a little underwhelming for me &amp; more along the lines of a SCREAM film.All in all, I highly recommend this film to any fan of the 1976 original, unlike the vast majority of the sequels which do little or anything new with the material to make it stand apart from their originals, THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN (2014) is a highly inventive sequel that delivers everything a fan could want from a really good horror movie, decent kills, great gore effects, a good body count &amp; enough twists, turns, suspense &amp; tension &amp; atmosphere to help it become one of the best horror films to come out in a while.**** stars</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a pretty solid slasher entry. I've never seen the original film, but I found it very interesting that this movie acknowledges the original film exists and uses it as a jumping off point. In that way, the film functions as a remake, a sequel and a stand-alone film; it's an interesting twist on the rebooting phenomenon, one that I haven't seen before and it's used here just enough to honour the original and its fan while also finding its own narrative identity. It's also surprisingly socially progressive, with all characters (whether male or female, white or black, heterosexual or homosexual, etc) treated with more respect than can be expected in most slashers. Worth a shot for genre fans :)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thankfully Not a Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I never really looked into it too much, and suspected the 2014 release of The Town That Dreaded Sundown was simply another in the long list of remakes that have been coming out. I was happy to see that I couldn't have been more incorrect. This movie takes place in a world where the murders attributed to the still unidentified Phantom Killer took place just as they did in the real world and, also like the real world, the film The Town That Dreaded Sundown was released in 1976. It is only where the events of this more recent movie come into play that the story deviates from the world we actually live in, wherein a new killer begins committing murders reminiscent of those from the earlier film and the real life murders that inspired them. This movie can't even be properly categorized as a sequel, much like the Blair Witch 2 wasn't a sequel to The Blair Witch Project, being far too meta for that classification. I actually very much enjoyed this movie (possibly more than the previous movie of the same name), but I also enjoyed Blair Witch 2 more than the first movie, so my judgment might be questionable.

		<shortDescription>A Modern Horror Gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>How recent horror movies like Silent Hill: Revelation and Texas Chainsaw get proper theatrical release defeats me. I know, I know, its predecessors made a lot of money, and I know, studio executives want nothing more than to get an extra bit of green in their pockets. But when films like The Town That Dreaded Sundown come along, I can't help but come out and say that I get just a little pissy. Do executives believe that audiences are so stupid that they would rather watch the stupid sequel to an already stupid horror movie instead of a intelligently made one?The horror genre is in a supremely weird state at the moment. Theatrical releases are usually limited to the sequels I angrily mentioned earlier. Sometimes (but rarely) we get a piece of original work, but even then, quality scare fests are hard to come by in the mainstream. Audiences tend to associate "scary" with blood-and-guts or cheap jump-scares, which is maybe why something subtle like Oculus makes nearly $54 million less than cat-at-the-camera garbage like Ouija (which, by the way, is so terrible that I would sincerely rather watch a raccoon dig through, you guessed it, actual garbage). Good horror movies, dare I say it, seem to be found mostly in independent cinema (The Innkeepers, Rec). It's unfair that an entire genre is thriving off hidden gems that few people end up ever seeing.Now here we have The Town That Dreaded Sundown, perhaps one of the most obscure (and best) indie horror flicks of the 2010s. If that name sounds familiar, then there is a reason. It shares more than a few similarities with the 1976 cult slasher of the same name. Do not be fooled: This is hardly a film you can call a sequel, a reboot, or any other disgusting label given to something that should just be called original. The real town that dreaded sundown, Texarkana, was rocked by a series of unsolved murders in the 1940s, the 1976 film attempting to give it some based-on- a-true-story rawness. This 2014 film, which takes place in 2013, is fully aware of the deaths that plagued the '40s, but it also references the 1976 movie that turned the heinous crimes into cinema lure. It is meta, sumptuously photographed, and genuinely thrilling. The fact that The Town That Dreaded Sundown was confined to video-on-demand while Paranormal Activity: The Marked Ones collected dust during its proper release, is maddening.The beginning of the film marks the 67th anniversary of the 1946 killings, with Texarkanan citizens are reminiscing by watching the 1976 film at a crowded drive-in (as I said, this film is meta). Jami (Addison Timlin, in an inviting and immediately likable performance) is on a date with Corey (Spencer Treat Clark), but she can't seem to pull any romance out of scenery so distracted by graphic murders. As if trying to sign a death wish, they depart, hoping to find some privacy down a secluded country road. I'll cut to the chase: They are attacked by a masked assailant dressed identically to the antagonist of the 1976 movie. Corey is brutally murdered, but Jami survives the confrontation. Deaths continue, and the killer, as it seems, feels as though his work has been unfinished with Jami still alive.The directorial debut for Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, the man responsible for giving American Horror Story its visual strangeness, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is almost by-the-numbers, but Gomez-Rejon doesn't allow us to go unconvinced. He provides the film with a purposely cheap look, dramatically lighting the daytime scenes to remind us that they are the few hours of safety in Texarkana, while darkening the night as unrealistically as possible to ensure that the killer can more easily sneak up on us. The film is obviously the work of a maestro close to setting his stylistic goals in cement; if Gomez-Rejon continues on a similarly brainy horror path, he could eventually break into the mainstream he deserves to be in.With a heavy heart, I must admit that it's clear to me that the horror genre is going down the pooper. If companies are putting The Babadook, which is already considered to be the best horror film of the decade, in limited release, where are we headed? If talents like Gomez-Rejon keep working, and films like The Town That Dreaded Sundown continue to be made, some of us will be content. But much of the public fawns over the Saw movies, and we need to get out of that sickened mindset.Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Ultimate Movie Review! - http://tss5078.blogspot.com - @tss5078</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The concept behind the film, The Town That Dreaded Sundown, is actually a lot more interesting then the film itself. From the minds behind American Horror Story, comes a tale that is based on the true story of The Phantom Killer, who was active in Texarkana, Texas during 1946. The story was originally turned into a successful film in 1975, but rather than re-make it or do a sequel, the writers went in a totally different direction, one that I've never seen before. This film takes place in 2014 and acknowledges the story and even the previous film. In fact, clips of the original film are seen throughout this movie, and even the son of the original Director plays a part in this new film, which sees the Phantom Killer return after a nearly 70 year absence. Addison Timlin stars, following her leading role in Odd Thomas, and with new challenges comes experience. While I loved Odd Thomas, I thought she was terrible, but in this film it's a complete turn around, as Timlin is the strong female lead a film like this requires. As for the film itself, besides it's interesting play on the previous film, it really wasn't much more than your typical whodunit slasher film. Interesting to note though, unlike the first film, this movie was shot at the actual crime scenes from 1946. It also marks the last on screen appearances of both Edward Herrmann (Gilmore Girls) and Ed Lauter (Shameless, ER) who died shortly after filming. I love the concept of this film, it displays just how talented and imaginative the team behind American Horror Story and the upcoming American Crime Story really are, but overall, if you've seen one slasher film, sadly, you've seen them all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Has a few moments of beauty.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Just finished my second viewing of this and I gotta say, I like it better the second time. I think the reason why I didn't like it the first time was because I got too hyped up about this. I let the images and the style of the whole thing get me too excited. Needless to say, the first viewing didn't go over well and I found myself watching reviews on YouTube and agreeing with other people's criticisms. This time, I went in with the idea of looking for things to like. I mean, it is a slasher movie after all. What I did enjoy, were the chase sequences. There were some really beautiful chase sequences in this film. Granted, they could have lasted a little longer, and in more than one instance, they could have ended bloodier, i.e., keep more of the nastiness on-screen. One of the most beautiful shots in the whole movie was when our killer was chasing the whore in the field. Watching the paths they made in the field from up above and then back down to eye level was gorgeous. I could practically smell the summer night air watching this. **possible spoiler** Oh, and I loved the use of the severed head to break the window. **end possible spoiler** I thought the acting was decent. We had a great little female protagonist, and a few other known actors thrown in. Not a bad cast. I thought the story was decent and ambitious. I liked that this was based and centered around an actual slasher movie. All in all, I really don't have any venom to spew at this other than it wasn't able to live up to my imagination, but very few things have lived up to my imagination. I probably won't buy this movie--mainly because there's really no re-watch value other than for the sake of writing a review. Had this movie contained more visceral kills and less aftermath carnage, tits, comedy that utilized Gary Cole, and maybe a more supernatural aspect to the story, then I would recommend it and most definitely purchase it. If you're a fan of the genre, you have to at least check it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Such a Brilliant Concept</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>65 years after a masked serial killer terrorized the small town of Texarkana, the so-called 'moonlight murders' begin again. Is it a copycat or something even more sinister? A lonely high school girl, with dark secrets of her own, may be the key to catching him.Anyone who has not seen the documentary "Killer Legends" should do so. Not only because it explores this case in detail, but because it is quite good. At the very least, you will find what you see in this film really happens every year: they really screen the film inspired by a serial killer who was never caught.This was produced by Ryan Murphy, which explains the casting of Denis O'Hare. We also have a waste of Danielle Harris, who should be given a much larger role than the blink-of-an-eye moment she received.Sadly, the concept is more brilliant than the execution.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>From one of the directors of American Horror Story, expect some uniquely and beautifully shot that makes this film rise above other recent slasher films. While the twist climax may seems pretty silly with a decent storyline but thanks to the cinematography, the directing, and the music that all comes together really well making it an interesting slasher flick to sit through. The GORES here are quite impressive, brutally bloody, and intensely done enough to gleefully satisfy horror fans. The killer here is also pretty creepy with some jumpy cheap SCARES here and there. Overall, this is a meta-sequel to the original film that's beautifully shot with smart concept and enough bloody kills making it one of a better horror films that's worth checking out this year &gt;&gt;B&lt;&lt;</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Stylish, excellently director violent horror remake/sequel</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard of The Town That Dreaded Sundown until late this year. It crossed my horror path when I started choosing films for the Halloween Extravaganza that I was doing. I didn't even know there was an original film until after I watched the trailer. The trailer for the 'remake' intrigued me. It looked like it could be an interesting take on the slasher genre. I still have not seen the original but I plan to since Netflix has it. What got me even more excited about this film was the fact that the film was being produced by Ryan Murphy, more famous for Glee but the co-creator of American Horror Story. As being a fan of that show it thrilled me. The filmmakers including director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon have created not only a remake but a sequel to the original film but also made the film cannon. The story starts 65 years later as the Phantom Killer starts killing again. Jami is the lone survivor of the killer wrath. He has chosen her to spread his message that he is back. With her past clouded in secrets, she goes on the search to find the killer and why he has returned. What the filmmakers have done is made the original film apart of the back story. Many clips of the old film are shown in the new film. From what I've read a few of the same kills happen in the new film.The story is somewhat interesting to start. But it does derail about halfway through with too many red herrings and not enough interesting characters. Each character with speaking lines has some kind of seedy back story. That makes for lots of guesses to who is doing the killing and why. If the story hadn't crashed a bit before the finale I would recommend everyone seeing this film. But that's the one downfall of the film is the story fails the fantastic film making. This film is stylish, vibrant and extremely well shot. The color scheme sets it right in the world of American Horror Story. It doesn't hurt that the director and producer have worked on the best episodes of that show. From the opening with a very cool and well staged long take, this is a different kind of slasher film. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon displays a talent for staging and directing in a powerful debut. I want to see what else he can come up with. I hope he stays in the horror genre. That is a place that needs such a creative eye. And he doesn't hold back on the blood and gore. These deaths are violent and gruesome. I was taken aback by the gore on display and the use of actual blood. The only moment I noticed CGI blood was at the end. Many of these kills are editing in fast but interesting way. They add unease and terror to moments that are filled with dread. About halfway through any attune viewer can unravel the mystery. But that leaves the story for a nice epilogue with a great final moment. I could see another film being made but I would only be happy if the director and Ryan Murphy were working on it.The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a remake/sequel that builds on the world the first film created. It's excellently shot and directed to point that I can't believe someone with this much talent was let loose on a horror film. Story (for the most part) is engaging. The characters keeps the film from running too much afoul. Any fan of the genre or film in general needs to check this film out for the gruesome deaths and stylish way the film is shot. I now feel I might be let down by the original.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A "Remake" that fails on every level.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown has been remade, not an obvious choice considering the original is a dire, fact based crime drama about a serial killer that ravaged Texarkana in the 40's. The remake ain't that. It's a cheesy slasher flick from a TV director best know for his contributions to Ryan Murphy shows (Murphy also acted as a producer).This flicks is really more like a fictionalized sequel that proposes to both solve the original crime and showcase a new, brutal copycat killer stalking the town. A young girl (Addison Timlin of Odd Thomas and Californication), who witnesses the new killer's first murder and begins receiving correspondence from him after, sets out to solve the crime.In the meantime, the town of Texarkana panics while local law enforcement bumbles, both rather insulting to the real life town the movie takes place in and openly mocks.That leads me to my second biggest problem with the movie, the first being that it just isn't that good. This is a true story about a real crime but the movie approaches it like a corny, campy horror flick. The kills are entertaining but silly and the whole movie is shot in an exaggerated, garishly colorful 80's style that makes no sense whatsoever given that the original crimes occurred in the 40's while the previous film was released in the 70's and had that great, gritty 70's style to it. And then this movie is set in the present and looks like a Nightmare on Elm Street sequel.The movie, which is under 90 minutes, is thin, underwritten, and kind of pointless. The story is not developed enough, the characters are not written well, and only the kills are effective.I will give credit to the cast, which also includes Dennis O'Hare, Anthony Anderson, and Veronica Cartwright, but they don't have much to work with.I actually didn't love the first movie either but it did have a great title, cool poster, and at least seemed like the filmmakers were trying to make a good movie. This is just slapped together garbage and the director really just seems like he is trying to show off how clever he can be with the camera and it's just not enough to hold the movie together.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Viewer That Dreaded Viewing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pointless remake (sequel?), that basically copies the original in every way minus the fact that 35 years ago the original was creepy and novel, while this is just contemporary horror at its lowest ebb, reheating yesteryear for a generation of myopic slobs. The modernized plot twist and asinine ending seem less like organic ideas and more like memes, fresh type placed over a stock image and passed off as deep, original insight. The characters arouse no sympathy, especially the lead female who is supposed to be Hurt and Deep but comes across as merely mopey and daft. Absolutely irrelevant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Killer (no pun intended) Reboot/Sequel!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Maybe I'm just easier to please than most, but I absolutely loved this movie. It was a really awesome, never that boring, and pretty interesting slasher film; while also being sort of reboot/ode/sequel to the original.I don't know if this qualifies as a spoiler or not, but sort of like in "The Human Centipede 2", the original Town That Dreaded sundown is a movie about a situation that happened in an old town.The cool part about the movie for me was the whole copy cat serial killer thing. Trying to scare the town again, the killer copied what he saw in the movie to take out some of the townsfolk, in sometimes pretty brutal fashion. With some pretty neat cinematography, some decent acting, and cool lighting, this whole movie was extremely watchable and interesting from start to finish.Bottom line is, I've watched this a few times now, with different groups of friends. I happen to love slasher flicks regardless of their sometimes cheesy and lame stories and effects, and I would recommend this movie to any fan of slashers, or good watchable horror films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Town That Dreaded Sundown</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Solid continuation (instead of sequel or remake, this actually acknowledges the Charles Pierce film from 1976, including it in many ways throughout the film; this also follows the actual moonlight murders case in Texarkana) of The 1976 film of same name follows a local girl named Jami (Addison Timlin) who is left alive after her jock football star boyfriend is murdered by a lookalike sack-head phantom, seemingly picking up where the last psychopath left off. Meanwhile, after a second couple and two teen boys are also murdered (and eventually those Jami loves), the Texas Rangers (led by a confident Anthony Anderson) join members of both the Texas and Arkansas sides of law enforcement (which includes the late, great Ed Lauter, and always reliable Gary Cole) to solve the crimes while Texarkana public begin to fear for their lives. Veronica Cartwright (of Alien and Invasion of the Body Snatchers) is Jami's concerned grandmother, Travis Tope is a clerk she meets while researching news reports and documents about the moonlight murders (soon beginning a budding romance), the late Edward Herrmann (The Lost Boys) is the town preacher with a spreading of gospel that demonizes Pierce's film (established in the film as a constantly shown movie that seems to always pop up at drive ins and on television sets), Joshua Leonard (as a deputy assigned to look after Jami; irony is this character), Spencer Treat Clark as the boyfriend of Jami's that was murdered, and Denis O'Hare as Pierce's oddball son (who lives on a boat, idolizes his father, and offers his own theories to Jami).A masterclass of stunning photography and film editing, along with a fine appreciation and admiration for the film it is inspired by and infused with, this 2014 Town II takes a basic slasher story and applies a lot of style. The use of a variety of light (including moon and sunlight, not to mention street lights), close ups and distance shots, set ups that move through action seamlessly, and ominous establishing shots of the sack-head killer are examples of what this film does so well; in spite of the story which doesn't go any place all that extraordinary. The camera loves Addy, and she offers a vulnerable, sweet, relatable lead heroine who does nothing to deserve what happens to her. The "letter sign" junk yard sequence, moonlight dialogue between Jami and Nick that is a prelude to sex, "murder" of her boyfriend while she must look the other way in horror, discovery of a body in pieces on the railroad tracks, drive in showing the original film at the onset of this film, and incorporation of both the case and Pierce's own presence throughout this film are just some of the memorable instances that emerge in this real surprise of 2014.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first thing you must realise about this movie (even though the film lets you know every five minutes) is that its not a remake of the 1976 movie. It's a meta-sequel, requel, nod and wink at the audience-quel that's set in 2013 Texarkana, where a copycat of The Phantom starts killing people in the same vein as the movie that was inspired by actual events. The town in the movie celebrates their morbid past with yearly Halloween screenings of the 1976 movie at their local drive-in. Soon after a 2013 screening, a couple heading to the town's "lovers lane" are attacked by a man in the Phantom's hood.The girl, Jami escapes the Phantom's attack and sets out to find out who the new killer is and what their motives are.Every once in a while we get someone who tries to reinvent the horror movie. Some movies are successful (Halloween, Scream), and some just make a laughing stock of the genre and really ruin it for everyone else (Paranormal Activity, and any movie that was made by the creators of Insidious).This unfortunately falls into the latter category, and while the opening to the film is lovely and reminiscent of the opening to the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre, the rest of the film is just trying too hard to be clever, you stop caring about Jami, and her mission to reveal the killers.Every now and again we get a seasoned actor say something like 'that old film bought back bad memories for me', to remind the audience that it's definitely not a remake, and something highly original, but we don't need to be reminded, we, the audience, are not silly, we get what you are attempting to do, it's just not working the way you wished it were.If there was the slightest bit of humour added in the film, especially considering the inclusion of Cole and Anderson, this could have been something quite special, but no, it's just another horror film that will get lost in the wealth of average horrors out there.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It wasn't long ago that I saw the original at a store somewhere and wanted to watch it, but never got the chance. Then this came out on Netflix and I was excited to see it. Finally my girlfriend and I watched it...Was not disappointed. I think it is probably the best slasher film I've seen, and I'm pretty tough when it comes to these types of movies. There are a couple things I don't understand in the movie, some unneeded things they threw in but I can live with it. I'm a fan of "solving" who did it and I was "half" surprised. I think that if you want an entertaining slasher film, this is it. It is simple, but simple isn't a bad thing. The jumpy parts were predictable, but still well placed. The downside for me is....there is a lot of sex, but what good slasher film doesn't have it's fair share?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Outstanding cinematography gives The Town a fresh look of slasher genre</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Like love on first sight, or murderous rampage for this case, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is impeccably captivating both in eerie night or gleaming daylight. Its visual quality is beyond any ordinary bleak and gritty outlook for horror films. It brings the unusual setting of a town on two states into an integral part of the story. Clever acting from the female lead succeeds in selling the role of a humble girl in terrorizing scenario, not your usual bimbo running in skimpy top.The retro story is about a town where multiple homicides occurred decades ago. Capitalizing on the story, a movie of the same title was made to highlight the murders and it became a cynical celebration. After years passed the same series of killing starts again. This movie is brilliantly self-aware, using old clips as homage and also tool to heighten the thrill. As the title implies the struggle is that of the city, aside from the main character's, and the movie depicts it very well with impressive veritable shots of the dry town.I adore the use of lighting here, let it be the simple lights on nightfall, the reflection of sun on the glass or change of color it made to the hair of the characters. Every shot has brilliant angle, the camera moves about any room with stylish deliberate pace. It gives the entirety of human interaction effortlessly as information is presented with poise and without frantic rushing. There are not many environments that can be this believably livable and not appears as just a setting for movie.The bloody gore is purely effective. There is little to none jittery cam or stale jump scare. Whenever blood pours it flows with impact. Some are seemingly old fashioned but they are delivered with sophistication. Addison Timlin as Jami does a great job as the down-to-earth girl. She has the vibe of innocence that serves better as audience can easily invest to her story and also self-continuity. Script helps the authentic feel as much of the dialogues are deceptively plain yet sentimental. A few twists along the way will captive viewer through the tour of the town.The Town That Dreaded Sundown bleeds with refinement, this is an amazingly riveting cinematic work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>70 years later, horror returns to Texarkana</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Texarkana serial killer of the 1940s was the original homicidal maniac with a burlap sack over his head, a trend we still see to this day (The Strangers being a fine example). The Town that Dreaded Sundown is more of a sequel than a remake to the 1976 film of the same name, which itself functioned as a true-story of the real-life murders that took place in the border town of Texarkana in the 1940s. Alfonso Gomez-Rejon's contemporary update is brutally violent without being especially bloody. It uses lighting effects and chase sequences to maximum effect, and the screenplay even contains a theory on the identity of the original Texarkana murderer. Above all else, The Town That Dreaded Sundown is proof that there's still a lot of energy in the slasher genre, and that it's possible to release one of these movies in the year 2014 without coming off as a plagiarist.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Smart, scary fun for slasher fans and cinephiles alike</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fans of American Horror Story should recognize the name Alfonso Gomez-Rejon, as it typically proceeds the show's best episodes. Of course, TV is not a director's medium, I was curious to see what he could do when given the chance to spread his wings and direct a feature film. And to my amazement, The Town That Dreaded Sundown not only doesn't disappoint, it exceeds any and all expectations one could reasonably be expected to have of it. Had anyone told me that more than three-quarters of the way into the year, a remake of a cheesy B horror movie from the 1970's would stand as my favorite film of the year so far, I'd have likely referred them to the nearest mental health clinic. Now that may say less about the greatness of this movie than it does about the poor crop of pre-awards season fare offered this year, yet as of this review, I stand by that statement. This is the best movie I've seen in 2014.Following a brief archival history of the murders on which the original movie was based and the fallout from the film itself, Gomez-Rejon and his DP Michael Goi immediately set about announcing themselves as talents of note with a stunning tracking shot worthy of Orson Welles, which introduces our protagonist before snaking through a crowded drive-in populated by future suspects and victims. Ending with a young couple sneaking out to a secluded lover's lane, what follows isn't so much surprising as it is surprisingly realistic, and scary as hell. Having already established that this is not your typical slasher film, closer in spirit to David Fincher's Zodiac than Friday the 13th or the like, we're plunged headlong into an investigation of the original case, the movie that followed and their influence on the copycat killings that begin to take place in their wake.Exploring the relationship between violence and film is nothing new to the medium (nor is the self-referential sub-genre that briefly became popular in the mid-to-late 90s), but they've seldom been used to particularly good effect. I suspect the reason they work so well in this instance is largely thanks to screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa's refusal to get bogged down in unnecessary exposition. The plot zips along at a nice clip and is never allowed to drag, with each fifteen minutes or so punctuated by a new murder, each more suspenseful and elaborately staged than the last. Not surprisingly, a teen romance is thrown into the mix before long, but it's relatively understated and never allowed to become cloying.The cast of characters are all reasonably well fleshed-out (even those with limited screen time), and the performances are serviceable, if unspectacular. That said, Veronica Cartwright does have a few nice moments, and it's nice to see her released from the purgatory of network television.So is this a great horror movie, or merely a very good one? It's a question I find myself wrestling with even now, after three viewings. It is exceptionally rare, after all, for a remake of this kind to stand the test of time. What's the last movie to do so? Invasion of the Body Snatchers? The Fly? Both are unqualified masterpieces. Throw in John Carpenter's The Thing (itself later remade) and you see that there actually is a precedent for such a thing. Does this movie belong on a mantle with those classics? I'm not ready to go that far just yet, but what leads me to believe it has a fighting chance is how well it applies a level of self-awareness to it's formula. The original Scream, it's sequel and imitators have been trafficking in this area for years, but they typically succeed only in reminding the audience that they're watching a movie, effectively draining any semblance of suspense. Not so in this case.In fact, the only real fault I can find with this movie is that the ending feels a bit rushed and is far too tidy. The original's greatest strength was the lingering unease it left you with. Yet, in spite of this small quibble, I don't expect to have more fun at the movies this year.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Just lighten up and enjoy a modern slasher.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The negativity in these user reviews surprised me. In a modern world full of James Wan/Oren Peli clones, I thought I'd stab my eyes out if I had to see another paranormal-themed movie. So all I can say is THANK YOU that someone actually made a well-made, modern slasher movie to break up the monotony.The Town That Dreaded Sundown '14 treads a fine line between remake and sequel--the characters in the film watch the original classic at certain points--an interesting blend of fiction and reality that keeps this from being a straight-up remake (not that there'd be anything wrong with that).What's to like? The director clearly knows his horror and throws in shots reminiscent of classics such as 'Halloween' while also paying homage to several set pieces from the original. Meaning, expect to see new versions of some of the original's famous kills. Rather than feeling like a re-tread, these scenes feel like a tribute to the power of the original, updated with a modern spin.The cinematography is something I expect anyone coming away from the film will comment on, for good reason: it is exceptionally well- shot, and certainly more so than any film in this genre has a right to be. Gone is the documentary-style of the original. Instead, one gets the feeling that the director (Alfonso Gomez-Rejon) is embracing his inner Argento, clearly favoring overly-stylized shots in some of the film's key moments that manage to bring a fresh visual style to the proceedings. The color grading also deserves mention, as it is beautiful. The widescreen 2.35:1 framing is reminiscent of Carpenter's classics and the frame is often utilized to its full effect, making one glad we no longer live in the age of VHS pan-and-scan. Seeing this film cropped to fit a 4x3 screen would be a travesty.What's even more refreshing is the lack of "stupid horror movie character" tropes during the murder sequences. Every character reacts realistically to suddenly being placed in a horrific, life- threatening situation. They're quick to suggest leaving the area once they see The Phantom, they jump out windows, flee cars, and run like hell almost immediately once the danger presents itself. It's nice to see characters that react the way we think WE would in these situations.The film is, predictably, gorier than the original, which is neither a disservice nor a bonus, as far as I'm concerned. Modern audiences expect it, so it just "is."I won't go into the moral ambiguities of enjoying a slasher film based on the real-life murders of so many innocent people, but for what it's worth, the film does take a respectful approach to the original victims and dramatizes the new deaths in the film to such a degree that we feel for them and the senseless acts of violence inflicted upon them. If you're looking for a bunch of horror movie characters you want to see die, look elsewhere--these characters are real, they have hopes and dreams, and their deaths are treated with the most sensitivity and respect that one can realistically expect from such a film.If there's one fault of the film, it's the routine slasher ending in which the killer and his/her motive is revealed. It feels like such a tacked-on cliché, one wonders why the writers chose to have the reveal and the explanation feel like a scene from Scream 5. Certainly a more original approach would have been welcomed and elevated the film beyond the '8' rating I gave it.Ending aside, The Town That Dreaded Sundown '14 is certainly a testament to the fact good slasher movies CAN still be made, even if they don't get the respect (and the wide theatrical releases) they deserve. I feel a bit creepy telling someone to go into this one and have fun, seeing as real-life murders inspired this series, but sensitivity aside...do it. You'll be in for a treat.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The remake, or better described as a sequel made nearly 40 years later, to the 1976 classic The Town That Dreaded Sundown, gives a good effort but ultimately doesn't deliver. Confusing itself with an indy film about young angst, including voice-over over music, it never quite manages to be as foreboding or menacing as the original. There are a few jump out of your seat scares but that's about it. The rest of it goes around in circles with one uninspired and forced twist after another.The actors all seem to be on a minor dose of Valium, delivering their performances not quite deadpan but lacking energy all the same. Whereas the original film sent chills up and down the spine and left a sense of dread long after the final credits played, this time around it's just a rehash of Scream or any number of other films without the humor or any momentum leading us up to it's final, not so thrilling climax. People get killed. The town sort of shrugs it off. More people get killed. Everyone claims they are worried and concerned while not really acting that way. More people get killed. We learn about a suspect through the alleged son of the director of the original movie no less (odd). More people get killed. We learn who the killer is. Killer gets killed. Young angsty voice over set to music. The end.Yawn.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Interesting Ideas Wasted on Mindless Gore</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Town That Dreaded Sundown (2014) ** (out of 4)Decent remake/update/re-imagining of the 1976 film has a young woman named Jami (Addison Timlin) surviving an attack by The Phantom. Soon everyone in Texarkana believes that the ghost of the original Phantom is back but Jami decides to do some investigating so that she can find the original killer as well as whoever is slaughtering new folks.The original 1976 film actually plays a pretty important role in this film because clips of it are shown throughout so you really can't call this a remake. It's not directly linked so it's not really a sequel either. I think you should give director Alfonso Gomez-Rejon and screenwriter Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa at least credit for trying something different instead of just giving us the same film over. Did they succeed? I would say no but there's still enough interesting ideas going on here that makes it worth seeing.I think the most fascinating thing is that they try to link the two films and there's even a point where the original film becomes a witness so to speak. This leads to a really bizarre moment where the woman goes to interview the son of the original film's director and they even say that Charles B. Pierce had knowledge of who the killer was. These moments are quite fascinating but sadly an investigation type of film isn't what this is.Whereas the original film had a great atmosphere and went for scares, this one here basically turns into a rather mindless slasher as we get all sorts of gory, over-the-top death scenes that just aren't scary. The death scenes really aren't all that memorable especially with the poor CGI effects. It's really too bad that gore was the main thing on the menu here.The film does offer up some good performances with Timlin doing a fine job in the lead. We also get nice support from Veronica Cartwright, Gary Cole, Edward Herrmann, Ed Lauter and Anthony Anderson. The performances aren't enough to eventually save the movie as there's a downright horrid ending that should have been left on the cutting room floor with just about anything else taking its place. THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN isn't a horrible movie or even a bad one but it's certainly rather disappointing that it's just a mindless slasher when there were some elements here that could have made it much more memorable.</fullReview>

They filmed almost the entire movie down town which is an area that not even residents go to often. Texarkana is a growing and prosperous city, not the small backwoods place the movie portrays. 2. Isn't it supposed to take place in 2013? Why is everyone dressed like it's 1970? And what's with all the old cars? The people here are fairly trendy and there is a new Camaro, Mustang or F150 on every corner. 3. In the scene where it's supposed to be Christmas Eve, there are leaves on the trees...and they're green. Im pretty sure it snowed that Christmas..come on guys 4. I'm sick and tired of people portraying Southerners as ignorant Christians. Yes this is a predominantly Christian city but the people here aren't a bunch of blithering idiotsIf you're going to make a movie characterized by its setting and people, at least make an effort to be somewhat accurate.

A college age girl, played well by Addison Tomlin, is about to get her groove on with her boyfriend when the masked man appears and puts a quick end to the romantic evening. She escapes and transforms into Nancy Drew, super detective. Besides living with grandma, our young heroine does not seem to have a job. In lieu of employment, the lady assists the Texas and Arkansas Rangers in solving this mystery. Other than above average cinematography and a decent performance by Ms. Tomlin in the lead, a silly ending ruins The Town that Dreaded Sundown.</fullReview>

There were so many ways that they could have taken it. And for it to end the way that it did with the boyfriend being involved, they should have did more with the back story of him.

		<fullReview>it started out OK....using I believe real newspaper clippings and stuff with a decent narration...which led me to believe that this was gonna be a fictional continuation but in the end it fails miserably...it cant decide whether it wants to be a pseudo sequel or a complete remake....in the end it just becomes a complete mess and just another generic slasher type film that's been done to death...the great thing about the original is while yes it did show the killer in action the movie itself was more about the police trying to track down and catch him....which I find a lot more interesting then this crap...The Cast the late Ed Lauter and Anthony Anderson in the film and then preceded to use them in scenes that are pretty much meant to run up the screen time...its a real shame that Ed Lauter was given such a worthless role he was a good actor and deserved better...Same for Anthony Anderson...hell even Gary cole isn't given much to do....in fact the police are pretty much non existent except for a few scenes at most...in the end it just boils down to another masked copycat killer chasing yet another teen....I say stay away from this bomb...if you have to watch one go watch the original much better film.</fullReview>
