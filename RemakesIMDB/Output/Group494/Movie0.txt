		<fullReview>Fernandel is no doubt one of the greatest actors of all time and without challenge the greatest of his generation in France. Capable of playing farce and comedy as well as tragedy Fernandel her mingles both in a rather strange story. The atmosphere of the Provence is superbly captured in the first part of the movie when Fernandel has to take the bus because he forgot his train ticket. As the bus driver stalls the departure because his wife is about to give birth and then invites everyone on the bus to join the celebration the actual "savoir vivre" of the Provencal is demonstrated in detail. The long and intense monologue at the end of the movie grabs the spectator by the throat and makes you sit at the very edge of your seat. Although superbly made and acted the whole is sometimes a bit slow for modern tastes, but it only serves to make the climax that more intense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The ending of this film is what going to the movies is about</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the opening scene to the final gripping ending, this film held me spellbound throughout. The story was presented in a life-like setting by the excellent cast. This was the first time I got teary-eyed at the end of a film. I saw this film in the early 60s and the ending continually haunts me. This film is what going to the movies is really about.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Provencal Atmosphere epitomized - this is to be savoured !!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't know how well this film is known across the world. I have lived in France for twenty five years and saw it for the first time at the end of july 2001 on French Television. What a good surprise ! Not only do I adore Fernandel and have many of his films but this one was in COLOUR ! For all those of you who love PROVENCE , this is THE FILM TO SEE. The film would appear to be based on a 1942 story called Quattro passi fra le nuvole of Italian Origin. THis story is the basis for another very romantic USA film called A walk in the Clouds, made more recently by Alphonse Arau and starring Keanu Reeves with the lovely Aitana Sánchez-Gijón.The Provençal atmosphere here is rendered down to the last detail, cafés, squares, the take-it-easy atmosphere, the slow pace of life, the cicadas, the pine trees, the hot sun, the bus driver who deliberately delays his departure because his wife is giving birth at that precise moment and he wants to be present when the baby arrives, but on the other hand doesn't want to admit it to the increasingly impatient passengers. The film's a gem for all that but I'm sure the film's makers didn't realize that at the time that they were making a precious colour record of the Provence countryside for posterity. The action would appear to take place in the area around Cavaillon in the Vaucluse department and Salon-de-Provence in the Bouches-du-Rhône department. Places such as Eygui?res, Senas and Plan d'Orgon appear as being the itinerary of the bus. From the little I have seen of this area it is very picturesque indeed and little changed since the making of the film.The story of the film seems out of synchronization by today's "moral" values ( this is no criticism but a sad acknowledgment of modern day morals ) but in spite of this it is really cute. Add to this that the actress playing the part of the young lady is far from unattractive.Fernandel is excellent as usual, this is not one of his funniest films but his speech at the end to the father of the young lady is very moving and produced tears in my eyes. His own wife of course, is not only unattractive, but worse, would appear to have a terrible character ! This has probably been exaggerated in the film to make the character of the other lady seem all the more pleasant.There's also a dig at the civil service mentality of the SNCF, which still exists today though probably in reduced intensity. Fernandel has a season ticket for his train journey, the ticket inspector knows this as he sees him every day on the train, but in spite of this because this day Fernandel has forgotten his season ticket at home, the inspector treats him like a common criminal and chucks him off the train ! Terrible behaviour on the railway company's part though this is non other than a pretext for Fernandel finding himself sitting next to the young lady in the bus !I have taped this on VHS but the colours are washed out, such a shame and I would dearly love to find it on DVD - no sign as yet in 2007.Would-be visitors to Provence and Fernandel Fans should not hesitate to watch this film if ever they get the chance - there is NO WAY they will be disappointed !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fernandel checkmates papa.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the remake of "4 Passi Fra La Nuvole" , "Sous Le Ciel De Provence" aka "Era Di Venerd? 17" will remind French users of the works by Marcel Pagnol ,which often dealt with the unmarried mother,the likes of "Ang?le" ,"Fanny" or "La Fille Du Puisatier".In "Ang?le" (1934),Fernandel portrayed a half-wit who helped the unfortunate pregnant heroine.He proved himself a dramatic actor ,as gifted as he is a comedy thespian .In the 1956 effort ,he did the same for a gorgeous brunette,afraid to go back home because she knows her father won't accept what was at the time a crying shame :an illegitimate child.Like "Honoré De Marseille" ,released the same year,it's a color movie made "under the luminous skies of Provence".Fernandel is marvelous as a chocolates salesman ;he's very moving when he blames the father for his cruelty;he was certainly in love with his protégée and however,we know that he'll come back to his home to find a rather unpleasant missus -we see her briefly in the first sequence.Alberto Sordi appears as a coach driver whose first child is just born ;Renato Salvatori as the heroine's brother has nothing to do and essentially works as an extra ;but Tina Pica,as the old aunt,almost steals the show from the principal when she plays checkers (draughts).</fullReview>
