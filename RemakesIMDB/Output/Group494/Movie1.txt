		<shortDescription>Beautiful, Wonderful, Romantic...but cynics, please stay away</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It always amazes how many opinions can come from the viewing of the same movie. But this movie should have as many admirers as possible.OK, the ending is predictable. So is eating, sleeping, working and making love. Is that any reason not to watch a movie? What makes CLOUDS wonderful is the ride. It is a beautifully acted ride: Keanu Reeves acting his guts out plus: international sensation Sanchez-Gijon, noted actress Aragon, veteran actress Elizondo, Giannini the legend and the irresistible Anthony Quinn, Beautifully directed: Alfonso Arau, Wonderful cinematography: Emmanuel Lubezki, the wonderful music of Maurice Jarre and the song by Cuban Guitar composer, pedagogue and legend Leo Brouwer.What is bad about smiling during a movie? I found myself smiling and giggling during the grape stomping scene. Does it hurt when you laugh? I guess only if you are jaded, spoiled and bored with life. There is love, mysticism and joy...This is a movie to savor and breath in and enjoy the wonderful..Walk in the Clouds....</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Does anyone remember real virtue?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Does anyone recall a time when values, integrity, uprightness and true human compassion were a way of life? A Walk in the Clouds does. The story is sweet, romantic, dramatic, and heartwarming. The 1940's was an era when it was terrible shame to be unwed and pregnant. Daughters were often cast away or sent to some distant relative to bear their child in loneliness and disapproval, then the child was given for adoption. I know because I was one of those children. For my mother there was no Paul Sutton to love her and rescue her and her child. The father, portrayed by Giancarlo Gianni was a typical man of those desperate war torn years who was unable to get in touch with his feelings on any level except work and anger. I am more amazed at his ability to show affection for his wife than I am at the anger which rules his life. The family who eventually adopted me was just like this family. Hard horrible father, heavy drinker, full of anger, yet rapier wit and tongue. The rest of the family are so real because in those days most families who had a disagreeable father figure pulled together to make up for and cover over the hurts and embarrassment generated by that father. Very different from today's dysfunctional families. Anthony Quinn was superb and Keanu Reeves could not have been more believable as a simple man with a good heart and high values. His character is not meant to display anything but goodness, which he does beautifully. We have to remember that men used to be governed more by what was right than by the emotion of the moment as they are today. Aitana as Victoria is very lovely and desirable, but her character is also governed by the morals of the day. While she is sexy and flirtatious and clearly loves Paul, she stops short of using his attraction to her to seduce him because the very things she values and loves about him are his stability and uprightness. Today most women would simply go for it, but this film is not about today. It is about real love and true respect. The musical score is simply beautiful and very moving. The wine country and the shot of the California coast along Big Sur are great. Oh, by the by, for the unbelieving, after the grape harvest in the fall the branches of the vine die and become dry and brittle very quickly. The only part of a grape vine that continues to live is the stock and it's root, but even that seems all gray and dead from just looking at the outside. A fire in a dry, post-harvest vineyard would spread and destroy all, just as it did in the film. Today, there are sprinkler systems, etc. to prevent such loss, but not in the 1940's. What a great movie. I own it and will always enjoy watching it again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a revelation, a romance, pure and simple, with no sex, no violence, no foul language just pure and simple romance. While many modern romance films claim to be such they invariably end up with hero and heroine ending up in bed (sometimes with a little too much detail thanks very much). But here, in this visually stunning feast, we have a romance where the hero, out of honour and respect, doesn't bed the heroine. I am amazed that it has taken me five plus years to see this movie, and I am grateful to the family channel for screening it for me to tape. With a relatively simple story, set against beautiful scenery with cinematography to die for, we are swept into a world of the past, where honour meant something, where marriage vows, no matter how hastily taken were still to be respected, and where a single pregnant female was a family shame (not the norm as today unfortunately). I read one review where the reviewer said "in reality Paul would have said not my problem babe get an abortion" in whose reality? 2002 reality perhaps but not 1940s reality, abortions were for bad, nasty girls in back streets, by unlicensed doctors not for nice girls who had made a mistake (okay so some things have changed for the better.) I simply loved this film, while it gives a fairy tale view of the vinyards and the family running it, it is a feast for the eyes and the soul. The entire cast are superb, particularly Anthony Quinn who relished his role as the family patriarch and seemed to simply enjoy being in this delightful tale and of course Keanu whose performance is so beautifully low key and understated he reminded me of those wonderful hollywood leading men of old, strong, silent, gorgeous, Cary Grant would have played this role back in the day, who would have thought to put Keanu in the same role? Turn off your 2002 brain and just revel in the sheer delight of this wonderful film. I just know I will watch this again and again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film in one word, "beautiful." Keanu Reeves and the rest of the cast make this film enjoyable. I am not a big fan of romance pictures, but this has to be one of the more enjoyable ones. The acting is superb and the story is excellent.A young woman heading back home meets up with a chocolate salesman. She is pregnant (but not married) and cannot bare to face her father. Keanu's character hides his true identity to play the role as her husband.This picture is worth seeing and I advise anyone to see it. Whether they are into romance films or not. People who bad-mouth this film are too dense to realize you don't need action and bloodshed to have a good movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>After working as an actor in such films as Sam Peckinpah's controversial Western "The Wild Bunch," and starred in Alejandro Jodorowsky's legendary cult film "El Topo," Alfonso Arau makes his directorial debut in a magical Mexican art film, 'Like Water for Chocolate,' set during the Mexican Revolution... His success makes him direct his first English-language feature, where he presents the strength and beauty of the bonds that can unite human hearts... The time was right after World War II... The place was more lovely than you ever imagined... Gorgeous scenery dominated by vineyards, the perfect nestle for a romantic fairy tale...Everything comes from the heart in this rich heartwarming film... Arau's vision and dream was to build a tunnel between what we know and don't know about two-spirited people, the roots and blood-ties of a family, its traditional values, and its attachment to the earth...Arau reinforces the borders of tradition in the Mexican aristocratic family who have lived on American soil for generations, describing her fundamental values: family solidarity, religious commitment, and cooperation with the land and nature... His motion picture derives its emotional power not only from the sweet love that blossoms between Paul and Victoria, but from the unconditional familial love that the young GI encounters while at her hacienda... Each type of love is strengthened through the knowledge that one leads to the other...Keanu Reeves plays the quiet expressive dreamer who finds the traditional values in a magical place... He is a genteel seller of chocolate candy who, en route on a train from San Francisco to Sacramento, meets a graduate student in crisis... He learns that she is frightened to return home because she is pregnant and unmarried...To protect Victoria from her father's wrath, and ignoring obviously the outcome, Paul tells Victoria that he believes "there's a perfect someone for everyone - someone who'll love you no matter what." He gallantly insists in posing as her husband just for one night...Making her American film debut, Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays the strong, exquisite woman 'so easy to love'... Victoria has been seduced and abandoned by a 'free spirit.' She is now on her way to her wine-growing family in Napa Valley to help with the annual grape harvest... While her silken butterfly big wings spread the heated air around the frozen grapes, Victoria's sight was enough to engulf Paul with desire... And when her dark hair tumbled down to him, Paul's face was burnt by the harshness of actually having been able to feel some part of her... This burning has been caused by something as soft and luscious as her beautiful black hair... It is simply Arau's shot of her luminous figure, that discreetly heightened her feminine mystique, and her strong sensuality...The legendary Anthony Quinn, a two-time Academy Award-winner for "Viva Zapata" and "Lust for Life," is the wise patriarch, Don Pedro who tries to intensify the romance between Paul Sutton and Victoria, while her father tries his best to show his displeasure at her choice... While chomping Paul's chocolates, the sagacious old man shows the polite soldier the root from which the entire vineyard has grown, and instructs him the traditions and beliefs of his ultra-conservative family...Screen veteran Giancarlo Giannini (who received an Oscar nomination for his performance in "Seven Beauties"), plays the proud, suspicious, ultra-traditional father, whose beliefs are deeply rooted in tradition: 'My daughter can trace her roots back 400 years to the best families in Mexico,' he affirms... As a strong believer in the importance of family, Don Alberto Aragón reacts violently to the prospect of his beloved daughter already married to someone who has nothing... No family. No past. No future! If you want to be moved by a consummate screen composer, and enjoy a wonderful family dinner... If you want to watch Reeves and Quinn singing and getting drunk... If you want to observe joyous women rolling around in a tub of emerald green grapes, keeping pace with the help of musicians... If you want to admire sensational landscapes sleeping against the sunset sky, or forming like a dream out of the silver dawn... don't miss this breathtaking piece of visual art, and step into the magic!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Who are you and what have you done with the real Keanu Reaves? This guy's come a long ways since Bill &amp; Ted.I was floored by the cinematography, the story itself, and the way the family was portrayed, capturing the way so many of the wine-growing families of the day were in California--not to mention the traditions and mores that existed at the time.Anthony Quinn also turns in a stellar performance, as always, as the eccentric grandfather that really isn't quite as odd as he'd like everyone to believe he is, spots Reeves for what he really is early in the story, and pretty much drives him to face what should be his destiny--but lets him think that he's making up his own mind. All in all, I have to say this flick is a major winner, despite the fact that there's no sex, no one is gunned down, no one is blown to bits, and there are no computer generated graphics of meteorites plowing into gasoline refineries. See it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a magical movie. Even if you turn off the sound and just watch it, it is beautiful. Of course, if you turned off the sound, you would miss the beautiful music. As for the story, it is a fairy tale, totally unrealistic. But it is a very, very romantic fairy tale. I'm an overage, overweight, cynical old lady, but I still cried through half the movie. If you watch this movie, have a big box of tissues, a big box of chocolates, and a large dose of the willing suspension of disbelief. If you have even one romantic bone in your body, you'll love it. If you can't suspend your disbelief, skip it - you will just be irritated.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A romance film for all ages</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many women who have written reviews said Keanu Reaves was an ideal man. Most men would like to think they could live up to the quiet strength shown by Reaves portrayal of Paul Sutton. Of course a woman as stunningly beautiful as Aitana Sanchez-Gijon could certainly inspire such nobility.They are many roles that Reaves is not suited for. I am not a fan of his Matrix acting and please keep him away from Shakespeare. However playing a humble straight forward guy with some nobility he can do. Essentially that is what he was doing in Speed, Something has gotta give and this role. He even did that playing an adult turned teenager in Young Again. I am not sure he is a great actor but he is perfect for this part.Aitana Sanchez Gijon has a beautiful screen presence which has shocked me why the Hollywood hype machine has not tried to build her up like they did with Penelope Cruz. This film did nothing for her career over here. I would watch her over Jennifer Lopez, Penelope Cruz and dozens of other actresses that Hollywood has hyped into stardom.Giancarlo Giannini is great as the father. Although Italian, his portrayal of a Mexican with roots back to Spain was dead on. Living in Florida near Tampa, many Cubans In Tampa trace their ancestry back to Spain and exhibit the same type of pride he showed in the movie.It was also Anthony Quinn's best role in years.However the star of the show was the music and the photography. Except for perhaps the music and photography of Last of the Mohicans, I can not think of a film where the scenery and the music did so much for a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why was this the last screen appearance for Gregory Martin?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an enjoyable film without a lot of surprises. It is pleasant without being really suspenseful, and its sweetness may be a little too much for the small screen where on the big screen, you just go with it. Aitana Sánchez-Gijón is flawless as the female lead, which is a good thing considering her leading man is the almost always flaw-FUL Keanu Reeves, who has amazingly held onto his leading man status despite having only his great looks and minimal talent (the modern-day Rock Hudson). With a great supporting cast (including a pre-Six Feet Under Freddy Rodriguez and a post-original "Swept Away" Giancarlo Giannini), Reeves' shortcomings as an actor can't help but stand out. Amid all the good players and romantic tone, there's also some lovely scenery and good costuming.But seeing this film on HBO nearly ten years after viewing it on the big screen begs the following questions: Why has Penelope Cruz been foisted on the American moviegoer when we could have had Aitana Sánchez-Gijón all along?! Why did it take Hollowood so long to rediscover Debra Messing after her bit part in this film? Why is Keanu Reeves a big star while the extremely sexy Gregory Martin (whom I still remember steaming up the small screen in the miniseries "Ellis Island") never appeared in a movie again? Man, he was hot! And although you wouldn't know it from his small role here, I'm sure he could act circles around you-know-who.I may never get answers to these questions, but if your video store doesn't carry "Il Postino" and "Cinema Paradiso," you might want to check out this slightly inferior but nevertheless enjoyable film. The reason the story is timeless is because it is an English language remake of the 1942 film, "Quattro passi fra le nuvole," and it was a good idea on the part of the producers to resurrect it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An adult fairy tale, and one of my favorite movies!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have seen this movie at least 20 times. It is an adult fairy tale, set back directly after the second world war (with flashbacks to the war itself from which Paul, a chocolate candy salesman had just returned.) He is an orphan, and he meets a woman who in 1945 has gone off to college, and has returned in disgrace, pregnant, by a professor. Paul (Reeves) agrees to pretend to be her husband for a few days, and then he will abandon her, leaving her and her child alone. The most romantic part of the film occurs when the temperature becomes very cold right before the harvest, and the grapes could be affected by frost. Everyone dons "wings" and fans the warm air from barrel fires around the grapevines to keep the grapes from being killed by the frost. It is one of the most beautiful scenes ever filmed, and one of the most imaginative one. They say you never see anything new in films now a days, well this one is new, and it has a happy ending.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most saccharine romance I ever sat through. The perfect film for an idle housewife in kerchief, housedress, and ostrich-trimmed high-heeled mules to watch in the afternoon, lying on the couch eating bonbons. In fact, bonbons play a prominent role in the movie.The only reason I was able to watch to the end, is that I finally was able to gaze at Keanu Reeves' dreamy face in almost every scene. In most of his films, he moves too fast to get a good look. The only rapid action in this show is Giancarlo Giannini waving his hands with Latin emotionality - more Italian than Mexican, really. The dialog is as stiff as wood. Unfortunately, no bodices are ripped - the hero is disgracefully perfect-mannered and mild. The aristocratic warm-blooded old-world family cliche is as old as the hills. What does it matter if they are Irish or Italian or Mexican? This is a fairy story.I knew before the titles finished running that this would not be the movie I hoped for. The glowing grapes looked like the paragon of all food ads in Women's Day Magazine. I didn't see his name listed, but the art director surely was Thomas Kinkade, who paints the million dollar canvases of Irish cottages snuggled in fuchsias. This film was literally seen through rose-colored glasses. If you like dreamy pink and blue sky, this film is for you! (The bonbons looked really good, too!)</fullReview>

It makes me sad that there are starving people in the world and somebody decided to spend millions of dollars to make this movie. Keanu Reeves is widely known as a terrible "actor" but this script is pure crapola as well. I found myself actually getting angry at several points throughout the film because it was so unrealistic and just plain old cheesy. The only reason this movie gets 1 star is because of the hot Mexican broad. Do yourself a favor and watch anything else besides this movie or just go bang your head against the wall.

		<fullReview>One night when I was flipping channels on TV, the movie "A Walk In The Clouds" was about to start. Since nothing was on I decided to watch this movie. When the movie was over, I thought that A Walk In The Clouds was a very wonderful and beautiful movie. Keanu Reeves was great in his part and so was the rest of the cast, I never knew Keanu Reeves can be a romantic and sensitive guy. The movie was very sweet, lovely and very romantic and yes there were parts that were a bit cheesy but lots of good romantic movies are a bit cheesy. The story is unrealistic but when you watch such a stunning movie, you wish something like that could happen. If you are a romantic person, then watch "A Walk In The Clouds".</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden treasure about virtue and beauty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an unusual story which explores morals, virtue, inner beauty, the value of family, clashing cultures, and romantic love.A WW2 soldier named Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves), coming home to California, meets a woman named Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) on a train (the foul comedic device of their meeting is the only moment that was out of place in the film). He agrees to pose as her husband and meet her family because she is ashamed of her illegitimate pregnancy (the father left her). He joins her in visiting her family that own a large wine vineyard.There are beautiful tapestries used in telling the story. Throughout, there is a slight coloring of the film suggesting its time setting of two generations ago. There's a scene where Victoria looks angelic in the vineyards as she and the rest of the family enact a traditional procedure to promote the health of the harvest. A fire is shown almost like a violent monster that pounces upon its opportunity to be unleashed. A grape stomping scene would not be expected to be particularly interesting, but is portrayed here as a wildly sensuous tradition.Keanu Reeves is often ridiculed for his acting ability, but he does well here. One scene where Paul resists temptation with Victoria has incredibly powerful tension. His conflict with her father, Alberto, (Giancarlo Giannini) and their heated verbal sparring resembles a fierce boxing match.Anthony Quinn does a splendid job as the kindly patriarch Don Pedro, Victoria's grandfather. He is the buffer between these two men, and somehow has insights about Paul, that lead to the resolution of the story.A hidden treasure with a beautiful story to tell. "A Walk in the Clouds" is highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Until recently, this was my most favorite movie of all time. I saw it for the first time in the theatre when it came out in the 90's. I bought it as soon as it came out on video and have kept and watched it many times since then. Keanu Reeves is perfect for the role of Paul Sutton. My favorite line is when Victoria says to him, "Paul Sutton, you are the most honorable man I have ever known." Great movie. I don't know why its not more popular. It has the best story line of any of his films. He's a very good actor in all of his movies, but "A Walk in The Clouds" is by far my favorite. "Speed" would be my second choice and then "Matrix".Another line from 'Clouds' is "Courage under fire", (this is what he received his Army medal for). That accurately describes his roles in the films he's done that I like so much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Set just after World War II, this movie explores the character development of a young man in search of connection. An orphan, he has never had a family of his own. He marries just before going overseas, and returns to find his war-bride is less than he hoped for. Nevertheless, he is determined to make a go of it. He goes back to work (on the road as a salesman), and meets a young lady who is "in the family way" and headed home from college, in disgrace. The professor was married.He offers to "pose" as her husband when he learns of her strict father's likely reaction. They plan to have him abandon her in a day or two, leaving her with a little dignity in the family's eyes.In the process he falls in love with both the girl and the family, but he is already married. 1940's morality will not allow him to consummate their love.His interactions with the family (owners of a vineyard in the Napa valley), only serve to strengthen his ties to them, and increase the frustration because he knows he must soon leave.The characters are believable and the story line is well written. Many will not appreciate this morality play, but it teaches many transcendent truths before it is through.I give it an A+.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Magical Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a magical fairytale of love, struggle, and romance, directed by the brilliant Mexican director Alfonso Arau ('Like Water for Chocolate'). Keanu Reeves has never been better at being a 'good guy', here tormented by his origins as an orphan, betrayed by a frivolous young wife, returning from War with a head full of hopes only to meet with the apparent collapse of all of his prospects. But Fate intervenes, and he meets the amazingly, delicately beautiful Aitana Sanchez-Gijon. She is the half-Spanish, half-Italian actress who two years later was so brilliant in 'The Chambermaid of the Titanic' (see my review). She has all the freshness of a rose which has just opened in the morning dew. This is what Penelope Cruz was like before she went to Hollywood. The story concerns her family, the Aragons. Her mother is played radiantly by the Mexican actress Angelica Aragon, and her intense and domineering father by the Italian actor Giancarlo Giannini. One of the finest performances in the film is by Anthony Quinn. He was rarely better than this. It is little known that he was born in Mexico, half Irish, half Mexican. Since his middle name was Oaxaca, his mother must have been a Zapotec Indian. Here he is utterly in his element, since the story is of an ancient Spanish family with a vineyard in the Napa Valley of California. Whether such people still exist anymore, I doubt. But this is a fantasy, very similar to the wonderful series of three novels by Bret Harte, commencing with 'A Waif of the Plains'. Certainly these days, as Hispanics become more and more important in America, more films like this should be made exploring the early Spanish settler traditions. Much was made of this sort of thing in Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', but the lead was not followed up by subsequent mainstream directors. This film is a poignant story of how the lost and lonely orphan Keanu Reeves finds true love and acceptance at last in the bosom of a family and in the arms of one of the most delectable gals imaginable. But he only achieves this by being noble, generous, kind, unbelievably tolerant and patient, and by being tested in every conceivable way. Reeves could not possibly have played this character so well unless he had a lot of these qualities himself. The film is a wonderful achievement, the period costumes and sets are perfect, the buildings are authentic Spanish survivals from various places in the Napa Valley, apparently, the atmosphere is pure magic, the vicissitudes are harrowing, but love and devotion and goodness conquer all. This is actually a romantic film from an adult perspective which children can safely see, and that's saying something these days. No grunting in corners, as the emphasis is on love, - remember love? It used to exist. Maybe it will come back one day. We need more films like this to encourage us. We also need more Aitana Sanchez-Gijons, if we can remember and pronounce their names, that is. Etana was Sumerian for 'eagle'. I wonder if there is any connection with Aitana, as she has the same noble quality. This film is an eagle, it soars, it truly soars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul (Keanu Reeves) has just returned from World War II. He is plagued by horrific memories of combat and wants desperately to start again with his wife (Debra Messing). The trouble is, however, that their marriage was a rushed, wartime affair, as Paul, like soldiers everywhere in America, wanted to taste love and matrimony before being sent into battle. She seems happy to see him but wants him to return to his traveling salesman position as soon as possible. Once on the road, again, Paul meets a stunningly beautiful Mexican-American woman named Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) on the bus. When a small group of men begin to harass her, Paul comes to her rescue, with fists flying. Subsequently, both Paul and Victoria are tossed off of the bus. As they are waiting for the next Greyhound, Victoria tearfully tells Paul that she is pregnant, "done wrong" by a professor at the university she attended. Her father, a wealthy vineyard owner, is going to "kill her", as Victoria states. But, wait. What if Paul pretends to be her new husband and goes home with her for a day or two? Then, the big blow of an out-of-wedlock pregnancy will be avoided and the couple can "divorce" some time later. Paul agrees to help her and they return to the stunningly beautiful vineyard and mansion she calls home. Naturally, her father (Giancarlo Giannini) is angry at the sudden marriage, especially since Paul is an orphan and Victoria can trace her family's history back 400 years. Yet, Victoria's mother and grandfather (Anthony Quinn) try to make their new relative comfortable. But, will Victoria and Paul be able to pull the wool over everyone's eyes? And, what about the undeniable attraction that is brewing between the young couple? This is one of the most romantic films ever, giving great delight to anyone who craves tales of epic love. Reeves and Sanchez-Gijon are terrific as the gorgeous and confused young lovers while Quinn gives a great turn as the family's patriarch. Giannini, too, does a nice job as the proud yet vulnerable father and the other actors are quite fine, too. As for the costumes, script, and production values, they are wonderful, also. But, indeed, it is the stunning photography of the lovely vineyard and stately family home that takes this film into the upper echelons of visually-arresting movies. For those in the world who would like to stir up a romantic evening with their partners, this film is a great catalyst. After a showing of its loveliness and romance, most every viewer will be in the proper mood for a night of love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a wonderful love story but with much more in it, this is an amazing familial character study. The Characters all seem well-carried out, from the father who works too hard to provide not only a living but a heritage, to the mother who lovingly provides support and wisdom through out the movie. Even minor characters are represented well. Scenery in this movie is to-die-for breath-taking. Because of stereotypes, I would have never chosen Keanu Reeves in this role but he does it justice and makes the role believable. All the actors add such richness to the movie that it makes you think it's taken from a true story and it very well could be. This movie is one you'll watch again and again. It's a marvelous feel good family movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is delightful. The main character, played by Keanu Reeves, represents a era when men were still chivalrous, honorable, and ready to lay their lives down to help out a young lady in distress. His character is remarkably refreshing and honest. I enjoyed the fact that while the main characters made mistakes, their desires to do what was right and taking responsibility for the consequences of their actions -- no matter how fearfully -- ultimately won out over the fulfillment of their personal desires and wants. Something that started out as a plan to deceive, ended up unveiling the inner workings of a closely knit family, and a young man's desire to belong to one.</fullReview>

It's for those who believe that love is about sacrifice and commitment, not consumption and convenience. It's for the ones who believe that there is someone out there for them.A Walk In the Clouds talks about the importance of family, belonging, and love, love even for the imperfect parent who doesn't know how to show love back.

Anyone who enjoys a good cry , a sentimental and honest to the heart tear jerker will love this film. Keanu Reeves, one of Hollywood's most berated actors, gives a convincing performance as the hero. You will pull for him the whole way. He's a combo of Jimmy Stewart and Clark Gable in this wonderful tale of familial, multi-generational love, crisis, tragedy and ultimate redemption. The music, cinematography, and editing are way above average. The grape crushing scene alone combines the visual, dramatic and musical in an operatic way that reminds one of all the greatest scenes in Italian film history as well as the great I Love Lucy episode. Like a big spaghetti dinner, eat, enjoy, and don't take it too seriously. This film was meant to please us all in a simple, but thoroughly satisfying way.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In the end of World War 2, a young G.I. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) beings work as a traveling salesman. Along the way, he meets a gorgeous unmarried woman (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon). This woman is frighten to return home to her father (Giancarlo Giannini). Which her father is a wealthy vineyard owner, since her father is a domineering man. The woman asks Paul to pose as her husband for one day but Paul ended up staying at her vineyard's father place for a few days. Paul is slowly falling in love with this woman. Paul loves the life of the woman's family and finds a new life in this newfound place.Directed by Alfonso Arau (Like Water for Chocolate, Picking Up the Pieces) made a wonderful, nicely made romantic drama with a refreshing sense of humour. Reevers appears in one of this better roles. Reeves gives an relaxed performance in this film. This has good performances from the cast. The movie has an scene stealing hilarious part of the late Oscar-Winner:Anthony Quinn as Giannini's father. This is an old fashioned film that is romantic and even corny but it's works surprisingly well. This film is a remake of the 1942 Italian film titled "Quattro Poassi Fra Le Novole". David Zucker (Airplane!, Baseketball) and His Brother:Jerry Zucker (Ghost) are among the film's producers. T.V.'s star:Debra Messing from "Will &amp; Grace" appears in a bit part as Reeves' cheating wife. (****/*****).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Anthony Quinn, Gian Carlo Gianini, Keanu Reeves and Debra Messing lead an unfamiliar cast in a compelling romantic drama of two people who accidentally meet in the aftermath of changes which the second world war brought to California. At one end of the spectrum Gianini plays a traditional Mexican father trying to hold onto a nineteenth century Mexican family aspiration in the Napa Valley. At the other end Reeves plays an Illinois orphan whose failed one night San Francisco marriage and severe battle shell shock make him yearn for what he considers a traditional home and family. The two lock first philosophy and then violent horns and traditions in a series of unrelated, unexpected melodramatic events which bring Keanu closer to Gianini's daughter thus forever changing both of their outlooks on life. Brilliantly photographed, edited and acted.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Paul Sutton (Reeves) comes back from the war (WWII) to find his new bride is not waiting for him. Going back to work as a travelling chocolate salesman, he gets tied up with the Aragon family; a historic Mexican family who have a large and beautiful vineyard. It is their daughter Victoria that is the draw for Sutton. The story is rather special, though not entirely unpredictable, and is a rather nice backdrop to give Reeves the opportunity to play the engaging, gentlemanly, perfect but troubled veteran in this gentle drama.The scenery of the Aragon vineyard is beautiful, although I believe a lot of it is CGI, and the Aragon family are varied and demonstrate the rich tapestry of family life from the overbearing father Giancarlo Gianinni, the wise and strong mother Angelica Aragon and the irrepressible patriarch Anthony Quinn, who provides some lovely touching and funny moments. It is good to note at this point that - in light of one of those funny moments Reeves CAN sing, and the out of tune serenading of Victoria is acting!This film is what it is, a romance film, a stunningly beautiful production, well directed and with a good script. There are some moments of real tenderness and joy, and it says something about young men's experience of war and how they are left to cope with it alone. Genius it isn't, or groundbreaking, but it's really nice pretty picture indicative of the big studio star vehicle films of the time it is depicting.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Believe it or not, I was even laughing at some of the scenes in this film which has the most beautiful musical score imaginable.The scene with the family trampling on the grapes vividly reminded me of Lucille Ball doing the same thing on her famous television show. The scene where Keanu Reeves comes home from World War 11 to an unfaithful wife brought me back to Dana Andrews and Virginia Mayo in "The Best Years of Our Lives."Giancarlo Giannini is the distrusting drunkard of a father here. His daughter, unmarried and pregnant, returns home and on the road finds Keanu Reeves, a chocolate salesman and recent war hero. Reeves agrees to pretend that he is wed to the young lady.Giannini immediately takes a dislike to Reeves as he doesn't trust him and his cynical regarding his daughter's relationship. In a drunken fit, he accidentally sets the wine valley ablaze. Of course, Reeves pulls out a root which shows no damage. His pulling it out reminded me of Vivien Leigh clutching the soil in "Gone With the Wind." Again, I laughed.Anthony Quinn played the elderly grandfather who is philosophical and wise. Had he been 20 years younger, he would have had the Giannini part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Many online members said it better than I could. Does anyone believe in sincere morals and virtue any more? The premise of this movie is that a man is willing to go out of his way to save a woman from humiliation given her condition. We see very little of that sort of empathy today. The movie has it all; romance, compassion, prejudice, love and loyalty. I was never a huge fan of Keanu Reeves, but he really lit up the screen with this role. It is a tender story about a man who comes to the rescue of a Spanish woman who is with child during the 1940's. She is extremely uncertain about how her family will respond when they find out her condition, and Reeves comes to her aid. That is pure chivalry at its best. Anthony Quinn, as usual, gives us a lot of insight into the family's way of thinking, and that was helpful. It gave the movie clarity. Call me crazy or old-fashioned, but I thought it hit upon every emotion and touched upon many family issues that still burden the average family today. Great film. Two Thumbs up!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Magical fairy tale romance with an Old World feeling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautifully filmed ultra romantic movie. Contrary to its actual California locale, it has a wonderful Old World feeling to it, probably both because of the vineyard setting and the close, traditional family (albeit Mexican), their strong attachment to their land, and their strict, pleasantly old fashioned moral standards. It tells the story of a married chocolate salesman, Paul, who has just returned from World War II. During a bus ride, he meets an unmarried pregnant girl named Victoria, who is returning home from college to help her family with their grape harvest. Paul gallantly offers to help Victoria, who fears her Old World father's stern disapproval of her pregnancy, by agreeing to pose as her husband for just one night. He will then leave in the morning, casting her in a sympathetic light as an abandoned wife. However, various circumstances prolong Paul's visit with the family (who have quite taken to him). He soon comes to realize his genuine love for the beautiful Victoria and, while trying to explain these feelings to her hot tempered father, Alberto, a fight ensues that sets the family vineyards ablaze.The film is noteworthy especially for its spectacular scenery and amazing cinematography, those magnificent vineyard panoramas. Of course there is a grape stomping scene! Another is particularly memorable, where the family members are all valiantly trying to protect the vines from frost by fanning the grapes with hot air. All tremendously touching and dramatic. The unusual movie title arises from the name of the family vineyard, Las Nubes (the clouds).Anthony Quinn is the film's real star, in my opinion, giving an amazing portrayal of Victoria's eccentric grandfather, Don Pedro.*** WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD ***It is noteworthy and admirable that, while Victoria flirts with Paul and the two share obvious passionate feelings, the couple does not have sex. However, the end cheats a bit so we can have the lovely fairy tale ending we all want. Paul nobly returns to his wife, only to discover that she has just had sex with another guy! She gives Paul his annulment papers, claiming they made a mistake marrying so young because of the war, before they really knew each other. So now he can return to Victoria and live happily ever after. I think screenwriters dumb down the plot &amp; character portrayal in love triangles by either killing off the spouse or, as is the case here, having the spouse engaging in their own affair and asking for a divorce. It's just too easy, too convenient, and the lovers get the happy ending they want without being portrayed as villains.However, it's absolutely wonderful otherwise so I'm still giving it a high rating. Don't miss this beautiful romantic film with its incredible cinematography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Should Be More Highly Rated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A marvelous movie. If you understand the heritage and the pride of the people, this film will be even more enjoyable. If you don't understand, you'll still enjoy a charming movie. The story may be a little weak at times and the casting could have been stronger (Anthony Quinn steals every scene he's in) but the overall film is rewarding. Keanu Reeves is cast as the male lead and someone else (with a stronger voice) probably would have been better. He fits more comfortably in the "Matrix" series of films since they require a monotone voice with less emotion. Anthony Quinn brings his patented extraordinary acting capabilities to this film like a giant buttress. The scenes in which he is seen are among the best in the film. The flashbacks to life in the war are meant to be elaborative and expository but they occasionally pop up at the wrong times and the wrong places and, mostly, they are relatively weak. It's best to overlook the errors in direction and acting because they're mostly insignificant. Overall, it's a enjoyable film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Read the title. That says it all. It is so nice not to have contemporary "urban" themes in a film. All of the actors were well chosen. The female, lead, Aitana, a name I am not familiar with was excellent, as was Anthony Quinn and Keanau Reeves.I would have preferred if the director had not used as much "soft focus" as he did, but the location filming was beautiful. I also think that the film could have been longer, as regards the end, perhaps to show the wedding.I am familiar with the wine business, as one of my friends has a small plot in the Napa Valley where he raises Pinot Noir and Burgandy grapes and sells to a small winery. With that in mind, I would have liked to have seen a sequel where Keanu and Pedro blend their ideas to restore and modernize the winery and watch some kids grow up. I sure would like to see all of these actors again.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm trying to figure out why people would or would not give this a 10 as I did. To see what the problem might be, think how each of these groups would respond.How would Young girls under 16 who pine for a man like Paul Sutton, who believe that a football star can be such a man vote? What about women over 30 who know that the football star is not Paul Sutton and that he never existed or if he did, he lived 1300 years ago and pledged allegiance to Arthur? How about men of 18 who wish they knew one woman as steadfast, desirable and luminous as Victoria, but find only imitations of themselves and who know what to do with their bodies, but perhaps not their hearts?Then there are people of any age who understand the complications of sex, but know little about the rewards of love? How will men who are divorced and have paid a lifetime of alimony vote? What will single mothers who have raised 3 children on their own, taking whatever jobs all paying minimum wage they can find think? These women hardly have time for any movie, let alone this one.It is no wonder the average score is so low. (6.2 in my mind is pretty low).Yet why should any of these people reconsider? Why should the young give up their ideals? And why should those whose lives have made them bitter see anything beyond their reality? I have no answer to this kind of question. I only know that when we seek a certain thing, we find it. I once went to New York only for 8 days. I will never go back. New York is the most wonderful magical place on the planet, but my frame of mind was such that I did not have to look for it. New York came to me and I followed it. I could have found the crime and the homeless and the corruption (I saw enough), but what I found instead was Yankee Stadium, 42nd street, some cheerful Nuns working with the homeless, a city worker who wanted to buy my umbrella so he could continue working. He had the wonderful presence of mind to bargain and banter with me. My wife listens to these stories and the joy with which I tell them and begs me to take her there, but I cannot. I am not fit enough to be her guide and if she goes, she must go alone to find her own New York.That is how to watch A Walk in the Clouds. One has to bring one's own experiences to it and those experiences will determine whether one lovesor hates it. I used to teach physics to high school students.I never heard anyone say: "Oh ya. Physics is OK I guess". People either liked it a great deal and saw how majestic its scope and how descriptive it was and how it lead to a greater understanding both mentally or metaphysically, or they saw how impossibly difficult it was. A Walk in the Clouds will either be uplifting or you will want to turn the channel or stop the VCR. Whichever way you go, you will be very decided about your response, just as my physics students were. Isn't that what good films always do? We like them for their virtues or we hate them for the lack of values. And we must decide for ourselves. No one else can.So I vote 10. 10 for Anthony Quinn. 10 for Keanu Reeves. 10 for Victoria and 10 for her father and her grandmother and 10 because they uplifted my humanity and enlivened my vision. And 10 because I plain liked it and wish I had their passion, devotion decency and determination and the way they interacted as a family.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a movie about a man who helps out a pregnant girl. She is scared to come home without a husband, he agrees to help and play her husband for a short while. He already has a wife waiting for him at home, so he don't want to stay at her families wine yard too long. This is the plot, and i know that it sounds like a pretty average plot, but don't judge the movie by its plot.I know what most of you think about Keanus acting, and i could not agree more. Most of the time he is stiff as a corpse (I still get chills at thinking of him in that Shakespeare movie, brrr!). So when the announcer in a Swedish channel said that they would show a Keanu flick later on, my first reaction was to run, and run fast. Especially since the announcer said that it was a romantic movie. I thought i would get more "romanced" looking at two flies mating. But boy, was i wrong!I have never seen Keanu as loose as in this movie, the story is nice and the girl is the most beautiful girl in the world! Sure it contains a lot of romance flick cliches, but in the end that just dont matter.Sadly Anthony Quinn died last year, and if you want to see him in a under rated movie, this is it. He maybe dont have a vital role in the story, but you still cant help to feel good each time he is on the screen. This goes for almost all of the cast, it is in overall a well played movie that tones down eventual flaws in the story.Now about the girl, wow! I dont know if i have to say anymore. She is a girl any man would fall in love with instantly, your mind just goes blank everytime you see her face.I am still bedazled by this movie so maybe this comment make any sense. If this is the case, my point is that this is a under rated movie that you should rent as soon you get a hanking for a good romantic flick!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A charming romance for a more cynical time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>You often hear people lament:"they don't make them like they used to". This film is one of those magical examples where they really do. Alfonso Arau has given us one of the most poignant, old-fashioned romance films in many a year. Set in the Napa Valley shortly after the end of World War II, Keanu Reeves and Aitana Sanchez-Gijon play two people searching for their futures. Reeves as an ex-GI in a pointless job with a wife he hardly knows and Sanchez-Gijon as a pregnant and abandoned woman afraid to face the shame she will bring to her family. They agree to pose as a married couple in order for her to save face and placate the anticipated anger of her stern father. What follows is a lovingly realized story of family, love and understanding played out against the beauty of the northern California wine country. The vineyard owned by Sanchez-Gijon's family is pure fantasy created by some wonderful visual effects but it provides the perfect setting for the film. There are moments in this film of sensual beauty every bit as breathtaking as the vineyard itself. One of the great joys of this film is the performance of Anthony Quinn as Don Pedro, Sanchez-Gijon's grandfather. He steals every scene he's in. His performance is funny and charming and his character always has a knowing twinkle in his eye. A pure delight to watch. For those with unjaded hearts, settle down with the one you love and share a glass of wine as you watch this film and relish it's pure heart and the exquisite joy of it's touching romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flawless</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is basically a film with no weaknesses. A couple of important points: First, I have seen a few reviews of the film complaining about the fire scene. Spoilers ahead: That scene is brilliant and necessary because Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) showed Alberto Aragon (Giancarlo Giannini), that he has what it takes to follow in his footsteps to not only run the winery, but to make it even better (Which is what the last scene in the film shows). The fire essentially was a cleansing agent, erasing most of the old and bringing in the new. Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn (Who did the best acting job in the film)), knew that Paul had what it takes to run things which is why he said to Paul "I have faith in you and my son." This point is critical because he knew Pedro Jr (Freddy Rodriguez), had no interest in running the business, thus, only Paul had what it took to keep the business going after Alberto passed on ( Alberto knew a way of life was ending, and finally admitted to Victoria he was " afraid of losing you and everything"). I also look at the scene, where Don Pedro talked to Paul and then he looked and found the root of the family tress and he lifted the roots out of the ground which reminded me of King Arthur and " Excalibur." Basically it was his destiny to save the vineyards, and one day take over for Alberto. So that the end, Alberto realizes what kind of man Paul is, and that indeed Don Pedro is correct, and Paul is not only up to the job, for one day taking over the vineyards, and caring for Victoria, but it is his destiny to do so. Which is why he said to Paul: "This is your family, and these are your roots." Paul honestly does not know what to do, but Alberto tells Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon (Who is a knockout to say the least)), to "Go to your husband." I have also seen critics complain about Paul leaving his wife Betty (Debra Sutton), for Victoria. If I came back from the War, and saw my wife in bed with another man, I would not want anything to do with her either. One more point about Paul he was perfect for Victoria, because of the way he carried himself: He was tortured by what happened to him in the war, then walks in his home to see what Betty did (And walks away, instead of hitting him, her, or both), yet was willing to help a total stranger (Victoria) who is terrified of her father, when they met on a bus. He finally learned to not only love Victoria, but the entire Aragon way of life, and essentially embraced being an Aragon. Which is a life far better than the world he came from (Including being raised in an orphanage, and coming back from World War II). It is interesting that it is something Pedro Jr and to a lesser extent, Victoria did not want. Next the scenery is incredible. Particularly the scene with the women crushing the grapes with their feet. There are so many themes in this film it is not funny: Love, honor, responsibility, decency, acceptance, change &amp; renewal to name a few. Do I love this movie? You better believe it (Not to mention who would not want Victoria? (But that is another issue)). Flawless film and an easy 10/10 stars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a beautiful movie! What grand and lush style and color, what emotion and care and breath taking scenery.. This has to be one of the most beautiful films of all time.A walk in the clouds is not something you'd except in the modern film industry, no this film is out side of what we see now of days this film is not a sexual charged romance film like 9 1/2 weeks or Night's In rodanthe. No this film follows the old fashioned way romance use to be like back in the 40's and 50's it is an a film with values that lie deep in the story and plot and if yo look deep enough you will see that there more to this film than meets the eye.Keanu Reeves turns in a very believable and very skilled performance as a lost G.I. trying to find his place in the world, he plays the honorable and very kind Paul with such decency and grace that you can not love his performance.A walk in the clouds is just what the title says. It's a walk amongst the most beautiful and cherished things in life love, honor, friendship and most important family. This movie is a true joy and wonder to watch unfold on the screen, Once it's over you'll want to watch it again and again it's just that good! Alfonso Arau directs this beautiful and visually stunning period romance to perfection, and he does with such style and grace that everything seems to fit in. Those that said this movie was terrible or even a mediocre romance weren't watching this movie closely. You need to pretend that your Paul Sutton and that your helping this girl out of her troubles, if you do that, if you immerse yourself in the films grandeur and beauty then you are truly watching A Walk in the Clouds and you are truly seeing a movie that is wroth the time and the money to rent or even buy for your collection.All in all A Walk in the Clouds is a film that you just can't miss or ignore, it's perfect any day entertainment for anyone with a heart for romance.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The grapevines</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the third remake of a 1942 Italian film directed by Alessandro Blasetti. In fact, the new version, directed by the Mexican director, Alfonso Arau, doesn't bring anything new to the action, with the exception, perhaps, of the change of locale, from Italy to Napa Valley.The premise is the same, as Mr. Arau follows the Italian model almost to a tee. We have the decent young GI who feels sorry about the situation the young single woman who reveals she is pregnant. He meets her on a train and wants to help her face her stern parents. At the beginning everything goes wrong, then the parents accept him. He goes back to his wife, who recognizes the mistake they made upon marrying so young and going to the war without knowing one another well. Then, the young GI returns to the vineyard and to the woman he has fallen in love with.This is a film targeted to satisfy a romantic fan, who, judging by the many comments to this forum seem to have enjoyed it tremendously. While the film is not breaking new ground, it is pleasant to look at, but predictable.Alfonso Arau working in Hollywood after his much better "Like Water for Chocolate" seems to be a natural in the way he makes his cast respond to his direction.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>If you are a romantic person you will love this story. There are things to criticize but so what! Even the most beautiful women has her warts. All of the cast were perfect but some were exceptional. I thought Keanu was perfect for the part and believable. The girl was lovely and the scenes she played were touching and made you sympathetic. The grandfather was perfect and very understanding of the situation.... I only hope I can do the same for my grandkids. The father was hard hearted but there are real people like that so I don't find that unbelievable. The fire at the end was a bit much for reality and some of the geography seemed hard to believe. All in all I would see the movie repeatedly and still feel it is worthwhile especially in this age of crudity we live in!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Italian opera without the singing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Think of it as Italian opera without the singing. There is no other way to appreciate this film: It is about as light and fluffy, makes about as much sense, and is as absurdly overwrought and as unabashedly sentimental as anything by Verdi or Puccini. And surprise, it is a remake of the 1942 Italian film Quattro Passi Fra Le Nuvole. Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) comes home to San Francisco after WWII to his wife Betty (Debra Messing) whom he married in one of those whirlwind wartime romances and whom he really does not know very well. She has gotten him his old job back, as a chocolate salesman (Italian operaaaaaa!), which he really didn't want to do, but he does it to tide them over till he can think of something better. He winds up on a bus to the wine country. Among the other passengers is Victoria Aragón (the luscious Aitana Sánchez-Gijón), who is coming back home to the family vineyards from college in Berkeley with a terrible secret. The two do not so much Meet Cute as Meet Puke: She throws up on him, or rather she deposits a neat, tidy little packet of vomit on his shoulder (too much upchuck tends to detract from romance, after all). She is pregnant, you see; that is her secret (she is, after all, an unmarried Hispanic Catholic in the 1940s). Odd, though; after this introduction via emesis, she never displays even so much as a twinge of nausea throughout the rest of the picture, through family strife, vigorous grape-crushing, and fires. Victoria begs the amiable Paul to accompany her and pretend he is her husband, until she can reveal the truth to her parents. Paul reluctantly consents, anticipates problems, but is charitably disposed to this nice girl in trouble. At the girl's family's vineyards, the "couple" disclose that they are "married." At first angry, the parents soon accept the two. They insist Paul remain a while when he says he must be off on business. Victoria's father is the formidable, suspicious Alberto Aragón (Giancarlo Giannini), who immediately distrusts Paul and the whole situation. My reaction to the casting of Giannini as a Mexican vineyard owner was one of contempt for Hollywood; they went to Italy for an actor to play this role owing obviously to the shortage of Hispanic males in California (that's sarcasm, folks). But then, I thought: This is Italian opera! Who better to cast than an Italian? The two must share a bedroom as a married couple, etc., etc., There is a running gag in which members of the family continue to sample the chocolates in the big box that he needs to preserve for his sales job. Inevitably, the truth is revealed, the enraged father is ready to send the dishonoring daughter away, but Paul is able to persuade Alberto him to show mercy to her, keep her at home, and love his future grandchild. Inevitably, Paul and Victoria fall in love and Paul is drawn into the stormy but loving Aragón family. But duty- and honor-bound, Paul leaves, glad to be out of this situation, yet regretful that the idyllic happiness that might have been, and that something beautiful and wondrous, is lost. However, when he gets back to San Francisco, he discovers that Betty has been cheating on him. With relief, he leaves again and hurries back to the Aragón home to be swept up in the climactic sequences involving a vineyard fire, in which everything is destroyed but a single seed plant, and `hope.' (It is interesting to note that the original Italian film did not have a happy ending.)Keanu Reeves looks good in a uniform and has a nice jawline, sort of like a young Van Johnson or Dane Clark, but his performance lacks something, probably because he appears to be a graduate of the Jack Webb School of Voice Training. Most of the other roles are of necessity mere sketches. Giancarlo Giannini overacts delightfully in his role as the father, but what I noticed is that the magnificent Anthony Quinn, at the age of 80 and in a relatively small role as the patriarch Don Pedro, still managed to dominate and steal every scene he was in. Aitana Sánchez-Gijón is very beautiful, but I didn't notice anything about her performance to make her stand out from the other very beautiful Hispanic actresses working in films today such as Jennifer Lopez, Jacqueline Obradores, Rachel Ticotin and Constance Marie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a satisfying love story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the video of "A Walk in the Clouds" and read many of the users' review.I liked the movie, It left a satisfying taste in my mouth. However, I was a bit disappointed with the fire-ravaged vineyard scene in which everything was destroyed, but one root that still had a chance at life. There is some hope, but how long would it take to yield income from that one little root? What would happen to the family income and family business until then?I don't understand when people say that he cannot act. I've been in drama in high school and college, and have seen "bad acting" in which the people try to act real with their emotions, but it comes out fake or monotonic. I DID NOT SEE THIS WITH KEANU. Sure most of his characters do not have much emotional depth to them, but some people in real life are like that. It doesn't mean the guy cannot act. He portrayed compassion and concern for the woman very well. He also had great romantic chemistry with her. And he "acted" like Paul really enjoyed the grape crushing incident.Back in high school, after one of our acting scenes, we were critiqued by other students in the class. One of the criteria was whether our classmates can "believe" we are who we are portraying. I totally believed he was Paul while I was watching this movie. I did not see Neo (Matrix) or Jack (Speed).One problem I have with this movie is the portrait of the family dynamic. One raging hostile stern father while everyone else is warm and loving does not happen in real life. A family operates as a unit. One negativity does affect everyone else.But other than that, I did find "A Walk in the Clouds" to be a good movie. So what if there are no surprise twist and turns? So what if there are no violence and intense sex scenes? So what if there are no disgusting element to it? It's a nice warm story. That's what it was supposed to be. It's not a soap opera.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romantic and Classic Style Film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film is a lovely portrait of a love story from the 40's. Based on the age of the Director and the fact it's a remake that's understandable. However, I feel it could have been better if someone wrote dialog to fit the stars. Keanu Reeves, who is good in this role, sometimes seems to recite dialog rather then say it. That may be his failing of that the dialog needed to be updated or adapted..not sure which. Visually the film is a series of oil painting like shots...lovely and somewhat unrealistic at times, but beautiful. All performances seemed strong and of course Anthony Quinn is a classic himself. Keanu Reeves always amazes me that he will take such a role as this, then do a completely different one...brave actor not just doing the same thing time after time like so many other actors..albeit their same role films are often financially better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Honest GI Paul Sutton returns home to his recent and long-parted wife to find she has read none of the letters he has sent her. However she has arranged for his old job as a travelling chocolate salesman to happen again. Paul is unsure of what he wants so takes a sales trip to have time to think. During his trip he meets Victoria Aragón who is upset as she is going home unmarried but pregnant. He offers to help her by posing as her husband for one day and then leaving her ? at least minimising her shame. However on arrival he finds a frosty reception from her father but is unable to leave due to the welcome of her grandfather Don Aragón. But will Paul want to leave?If oyu hate sickly romances then you should just stop reading now ? do you need to know more before you decide this isn't your thing? If you can't guess the ending from the plot summary then you're really very na?ve. It's that straight forward but it doesn't mean it's rubbish. The plot is full of wholly unlikely situations (yet strangely predictable) and brimming with old family clichés from start to finish.However it is delivered with a sort of fairy tale innocent that it doesn't matter than much. This is not a `get ready to be challenged' type film but rather a wet Saturday afternoon `let it wash over you' type of film. I'm not a fan of this mushy stuff but I semi enjoyed most of it ? if you're in an undemanding mood then it may be worth a shot.Reeves delivers a good (if cardboard) character and delivers his lines like you expect people in matinee films to do. He's good enough for the material. Sánchez-Gijón is also good but has little to do but look in love or sad. The only cast member who really holds the attention is Quinn who is clearly enjoying himself in a big warm cliché of a role.Overall if you're in a mood where it's cold outside and you need something warm and fuzzy to cheer you up then this may do it. However for many people I suspect this saccharine fairy tale will be just too predictable and mushy to stomach.</fullReview>

I wasn't a big Keanu fan before this movie, just as I wasn't a big fan of Brad Pitt before Legends of the Fall. Both films have their stars embroiled in passionate love stories, and both films make them earn it. And Keanu pulls it off here. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

A perfect blend for a spicy and yet slow romance.I think it is a wonderful film, well sorta a chick flick, men will enjoy it too I suppose, but I suggest the watcher should be patient since it takes Paul (Keanu) the whole of the film to realise what woman he is destined for- for the rest of his life. Also don't get irritated by the coincidental appearance of the mysterious girl, because she is important.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A film that telegraphs its ending after about the first ten minutes, it takes absolutely forever to get there. It's no trick to figure out that the leads will wind up together at the end. The fun is in the journey. And this one is about as surprising as making planned stops at McDonalds on a drive down the interstate. The girl's family are a cast of caricatures that only Anthony Quinn seems able to rise above. I had a hard time believing they even cared about their daughter. Reeve's casting as the male lead, Paul, isn't good, and he is betrayed by sophomoric dialogue which he attacks with such earnestness you almost want to cringe. You can't hate him, he's a nice guy, but as a character I was more interested in seeing him try to sell chocolates (his character is a travelling chocolate salesman) than win the girl, since at least I couldn't be sure of his success selling the chocolates and there might have been some suspense. There was absolutely no suspense in terms of winning the girl. Western Union delivered that message in an envelope during the first ten minutes of the movie.The plot is pretty mundane. Reeves meets the girl (Sanchez-Gijon) on a train and she vomits on him (morning sickness we discover later). They wind up on a leafy road walking to her parent's estate after he gets thrown off a bus for defending her from some unwanted attention. She blurts out her whole story (seduced, impregnated and dumped by her professor) and how her proud father will kill her for disgracing the family. Reeves agrees to play her husband for one night at the house, then dump her and look like a heel. She can claim a broken heart, the child won't be a bastard, family honor salvaged. Yeah, this would work well in real life. Like what if the vengeful father sent some strongmen out to break your legs, Keanu? At this point the average joe would say, honeylamb, get a frickin' abortion, never tell your father, and don't drag me into this. But any half-intelligent viewer of the film will already know by then that Keanu can't say these things because a) he's already in love with her and she with him, although all she has done is vomit on him, and b)the plot requires that he do this.Of course once there Reeves doesn't have the courage to be a heel and keeps getting sucked back into the family, even though everyone seems to know he's supposed to leave. In the meantime, Reeves and Sanchez-Gijon fall in love. Actually, they played the falling in love scene when she vomited on him, then get to play it again for the next two hours, repeatedly. But in terms of actual written dialogue they fall in love later.The family, incidentally, lives on the most gorgeous stretch of real estate - the hills are literally bedecked, and I use the word 'bedecked' with all sincerity, with grape vines (the family runs a vineyard). All the roads wind through forests, and the family home is replete with courtyards, fountains, winding staircases, just like real Mexican-American families lived in in 1945. Oh alright, so they're well off.Some of the scenes are absolutely ludicrous, especially the one where the frost almost damages the grapes and the family is forced to light burners in the vineyard to warm the grapes enough to protect them from frost. Now, this is true - farmers of citrus crops like oranges and I suppose vineyards do use smudge pots to warm the air if there is a chance their crop will freeze, but I have never seen said farmers don ridiculous diaphanous butterfly wings and run through their fields beating their arms to make certain the heat circulates.The cinematogrophy is nice, but after two hours I wanted Reeves to give up on this family and this girl and go back to selling chocolates and his sexy, dim wife played by Betty Sutton. At least that would have been a surprise. A dire, paint-by-the-numbers romance. Oh, incidentally, the name of the family's farm is 'The Clouds', so don't expect anything even remotely spiritual as promised by the film's title.</fullReview>

Keanu Reeves, has lived the character of Paul Sutton. The calm and caring attitude of Paul made me think as if Keanu has carried out of his real life. There was no cinematic acting by any of the actors. It felt me that I was entering a real family which values the family tradition and was cherished by the vineyard. The cinematography was excellent especially vineyard scenes and the festival. This movie is recommended for people who like movies which make us appreciate the real love.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Reeves plays a GI back from the war who crosses paths with a young Hispanic woman on her way home, having been impregnated by one of her professors. She is convinced her old-world father will kill her, so the soldier offers to pose as her husband for one day. Of course, they quickly fall for each other, but this is complicated by the tyrannical father's hatred of this gringo, and the fact that the soldier is actually married to someone else. Beautifully photographed with a great musical score, this oddball romance should appeal to most females and sensitive males. Reeves and his costar, whose name I can't spell, are wonderful together. Giannini makes a great dastardly dad, and Quinn does his Zorba routine as the loving grandpa and family patriarch. The whole thing plays out like a fairy tale, sort of like "Pretty Woman." Which is to say, you won't believe it for one minute but you go along with it. And be prepared: The ending of this leisurely paced film is rather abrupt. An American director would have done a bit more, and staged a lavish wedding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Romance without the comedy....well, almost.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are a few scenes in this love story which will bring out a few chuckles, but all in all this is a film about family, love, and joy. Keanu Reeves portrays the orphan Paul Sutton, a man who has fought to be acknowledged all his life and has returned a decorated war hero and a young man in search of himself. He has had a lot of time to think about who he is and what he wants to be. He and Debra Messing portray an often ignored segment of the American post war population, the ones who got married on the spur of the moment and were separated for four years during the war. They grew apart, and hardly know one another. So when Paul meets Victoria, he is pursuing a path unknown, a path beyond the dreams he made in his mind while separated from Betty. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon portrays the woman "in trouble", which at that time being pregnant out of wedlock was nearly cause for public stoning, and especially in a strict Roman Catholic family. Her performance, along with the stellar performances of Anthony Quinn as Victoria's grandfather and Giancarlo Giannini as Victoria's father, make this romance a stunning piece of true romance. Every scene, every nuance of the film presses you deeper and deeper into the feelings of the characters, and the scenery and photography are incredibly breathtaking. Rated PG-13 for sexual themes and war scenes, this is a film for Date Night with your significant other. Collectible, absolutely, if for no other reason than to have evidence of Keanu's occasional good sense in accepting a role.</fullReview>

People like to unjustly dumb-down Keanu Reeves; all i want to say is Keanu has not allowed himself to be typecast. He has done comedy (Bill &amp; Ted, Parenthood, Something's Gotta Give); romance (Walk in the Clouds, Sweet November, The Lake House); drama (River's Edge, Devil's Advocate); action (Speed, Matrix, Chain Reaction), and Shakespeare (Hamlet, Much Ado About Nothing).

		<fullReview>A Walk In The Clouds is a lovely and unabashedly romantic film with gorgeous cinematography and a strong cast. Keanu Reeves is authentic as the orphan soldier who tries to help the beautiful daughter of a well-established Spanish family that owns a vineyard and winery in Northern California. Aitana Sanchez-Gijon plays Victoria with heart and sensitivity, and she and Keanu seem like a couple from the moment they meet. Anthony Quinn, who plays her grandfather steals every scene he's in with his charming performance. Keanu and Anthony have great chemistry together, and look like they could be related since they are similar in their height and build, their noses and even their face shapes!Although it came out in 1995, it holds up visually, since it takes place after WWII. The production values, sets, costumes, and hairstyles are appropriate for the time period. I heartily recommend this for all die-hard romantics! And lastly - Roger Ebert liked it, 'nuff said!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When you put Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Giannini together, you expect some magic. These are two GIANTS of the screen from Europe who have put together some of the most memorable performances on film. I think they could read the dictionary and make it sound important.Poor Keanu Reeves. His scenes with these two cinematic giants just showed how really out of his depth he was. He seems like an earnest guy, and he has found some roles that suit him, (The Matrix series.) but this was WAY over his head. If they had found someone else for the role, I think they could have pulled it off. That and.....The end? REALLY?! The story was quite a stretch from the start, but I felt like they kept it moving along, and there were some well written scenes. But when they set everything on fire at the end, it was just dumb and ridiculous.I will say this is one of the prettiest movies you will ever see. It's a bit spoiled by too much CGI and enhanced trickery. My guess is they got tired of waiting for nature to come up with some beautiful sunsets for them. But the rest of the cinematography is really good.For romantics only. (And REALLY big Keanu fans!)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In terms of what "A Walk in the Clouds" does right and wrong, it's like "Memoirs of a Geisha," a dissimilar romance that came out a decade later. The acting is great. The cinematography is breathtaking. The film works with pure magic. But there's a big problem: the screenplay is terrible.Paul Sutton (Keanu Reeves) is a war hero returning from the Pacific to be reunited with a girl he married "just so I could have someone to write to" (Debra Messing). Realizing that he's entered into a nightmare, he resumes his job as a chocolate salesman. On a bus to Sacremento for his job, he meets Victoria Aragon (Aitana Sanchez-Guijon), a Mexican beauty who is pregnant and unmarried. This would be troubling for anyone, but Victoria's father, Alberto (Giancarlo Giannini) is so traditional he makes Jerry Falwell look positively liberal. Because Paul is such a nice guy, he agrees to pose as her husband for a day, then leave her, which would hopefully solve the problem. Of course, they fall in love, which makes the situation even more complicated.The acting is solid. Many people give Keanu Reeves a hard time about his performances, and that's a little unfair. True, he's no Sean Penn, and I doubt that anyone will mention his name and "Oscar" in the same sentence any time soon, but given the right role, he can be effective. This was true of "Speed," "The Matrix," and "The Devil's Advocate," which I consider his best performance. "A Walk in the Clouds" should be among that list. It's easily the weakest of the three, but his performance is not. Paul is so immensely likable that it would turn the movie into a case of sugar shock, except that Reeves keeps Paul so genuine that it is impossible to not like him. His co-star, Aitana Sanchez-Guijon, is solid, although their chemistry is more of the "great friends" variety, not "star-crossed lovers." The other main actors, Giancarlo Giannini and Anthony Quinn, are excellent. Giannini is Oscar-worthy as Alberto. He's rigidly traditional, but it's his love of his family that makes him so. Ironically, however, it makes him blind to the needs of others. His father, Don Pedro (Quinn), is like the rest of his family: wise and more open. He always on hand to give advice on love and marriage to the would-be husband. He is also present in a hilarious scene where he gets Paul (and himself) very drunk and has him sing a traditional Mexican courting song outside Victoria's window.Alfonso Arau made the art-house hit, "Like Water for Chocolate," a film that I haven't seen, but is in my Netflix queue (and has been for some time). The middle part is magic, and it's Arau's talent that speaks to that. Unfortunately, the beginning is clunky, and the ending is completely over-the-top. Not all of this can be blamed on Arau, however. It's his first mainstream American film, so he was probably forced to make some concessions at the behest of the producers. However, even they should have realized that some of the lines needed to be rewritten.Overall, it works, but not as well as you'd hope.</fullReview>

Well I must have passed over walk in the clouds million times (OK 20 times I do have a life) and saw Keenue Reeves on the cover and said yea lets get this one then you read the back to see what it is about and say oh oh chick flick alert (come on show of hands how many have said this) well I recently moved back home with my sister and she has about 600 movies to her collection and as you have a guessed it chick flick heaven. I decided to watch this movie(after all I did not have to pay for it ooops is that like an FBI infraction) anyways I snapped it in and started to watch. When I saw Debra Messing in it I said oh OK she is hot and started to watch and started to watch before you know I was like into this movie. The acting was well done and I was saying to myself this is a good honest story of the 40's and a movie with a good story line no killing , no drugs little sex but nothing to worry about. Then it happened the chick flick syndrome kicked in I started thinking about my ex-girlfriend and how much I wanted what Reeve's character wanted and I almost started to (oh my I am going to say it) CRY. This movie does not make my top 100 films but it does not suck either. The shots where beautifully done except the horrific blue screen (fake shots)but they where colorful and the director did what he was supposed to do confey how beautiful Nappa Valley can and probley is. Well when I am 80 years old (if I make it that far) and I am watching this ABC movie of the week on some kick ass space age equipment I will always think of my Ex-girlfriend Cindy when I watch this movie and think What could have been......</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Film With A Quiet Tone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A WALK IN THE CLOUDS ***1/2 Emmanuel Lubezki and Denise Pizzini's stunning scenery and the film's quiet tone can't entirely cover the lack of script development in the story's centerpiece: the procession of the lead characters falling in love under rather ironic circumstances. Set in the 1940s, homebound soldier Paul (Keanu Reeves) decides to help a troubled stranger (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) with a family difficulty. The viewer sees these characters, from which point, exposed to the negative attitude of the hardened old-fashioned father (Giancarlo Giannini) and counsel of the mother and grandparents (Angélica Aragon, Anthony Quinn, Evangelina Elizondo respectively). It's acted with authenticity and touches on some meaningful, earthly issues, but the characters' relationships could have been more developed. The title suggests one who walks (possibly in memory) on the grape vineyard, referred to as "Las Nubes," or "The Clouds," the woman's family owns.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A WALK IN THE CLOUDS, in my opinion, is a good film that's very romantic, touching and moving. It's a love story about overcoming all odds to be together. If you ask me, the way that Paul (Keanu Reeves) offered to pose as Victoria's (Aitana Sánchez-Gijón) husband was very thoughtful. When the fire broke out at the vineyard, I got really scared. In addition, I also got scared when Don Pedro (Anthony Quinn) got angry. Also, even though it was nice that Paul offered to pose as Victoria's husband, he still should have been a little more faithful to Betty (Debra Messing). In conclusion, if you like love stories about overcoming all odds to be together, this is definitely one to see. You will really be touched by it.</fullReview>

She is terrified about confronting the situation with her conservative parents (specially her father). In comes Paul Sutton (Reeves) who agrees to pose as her husband for a couple of days in order to trick her father into believing she is happily married.A walk in the clouds clearly depicts the cultural differences between Latin and American families. The clean-cut American boy comes in to rescue the misunderstood Mexican lady. The movie is fun and entertaining.

		<fullReview>Having seen this in maybe 1996, it was a long time ago. I still remember feeling ill at ease at the acting of Reeves and even Aitana and the awkward way the plot was carried and scenes were wrenched. Now thinking about it, I remember and feel much. I wish to see this movie yet again to see why I remember the emotion I felt then, so well, so many years later. I came to like Reeves awkward style and I miss not seeing again the inner beauty of Aitana that seems to outshine her looks (not easy), I guess Italy is the luckier. It also is a fond memory for Anthony Quinn . I should try and find "The Machinist". Well then, just out of sappy compassion I gave it another star, even though I over rated it before.

		<shortDescription>Keanu Reeves is a pretty terrible actor, so he fits well in this awful movie.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There are very few truly great romance movies. They have to have to have humor, along with the heart. They should have good acting, but mediocre acting is usually acceptable in romance movies. Most importantly, they have to control their clichéd corny cheesiness. Romance movies have a hard time from avoiding all the clichés, and this had some of the worst, clichéd, cheesiest moments ever. Unrealistic turn of events leading to a contrived, terrible love story.Paul (Keanu Reeves) has just gotten home from war, and all he wants to see is his wife. Unfortunately, his wife is nowhere to be seen, and is actually at home avoiding his letters. There was really no point in even giving him a wife, because she's out of the picture for the most part, and we move on to the actual plot, which is a shame, because Debra Messing is actually kind of amusing in a ditsy, over the top role....too bad. Paul is on his way to a grape field for his chocolate selling work, when he accidentally helps, falls on, gets thrown up on, and switches tickets with this nice young Hispanic woman, Victoria. After many more odd turn of events, he ends up pretending to be married to her. Then the plot switches to a slightly better, but still awful version of Guess Who's Coming to Dinner. Victoria's Mexican father is very built on Spanish beliefs, so naturally he doesn't like Keanu Reeves, the gringo. The plot develops, Keanu Reeves remains emotionless in his performance, and it only gets stupider as it goes along. Anthony Quinn is annoying, but gives a pretty good performance, and so does Giancarlo Gianni as the overprotective father. Other than a few performances and an interesting musical score, this is a real loser of a film.My rating: * out of ****. 100 mins. PG-13 for sensuality.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the most romantic film I have ever seen and the actors are all top notch. Anthony Quinn, so well casted, portrays one of the most likable characters in film who not only makes Reeve's character welcome at the family vineyard but the viewer is invited in as well. Aitana Sanchez-Gihon's Victoria is the most sexy role and without any sex or nudity required. She is intoxicating on the screen. Keanu Reeves is at his best as a caring yet innocent man who's life had no direction until his coincidental meeting with Gihon on a bus. The chemistry between Gihon and Reeves is perfect and you can feel their love growing by the minute. Giancarlo Giannini, as the traditional father,is so believable that any father of a daughter can feel his pain and fear of his slipping control over his children's lives. This is one of my favorite all time films.</fullReview>

If one watches with a critical attitude, one will always find something to criticize. Show a critic a Rembrandt and he/she will find fault. Humans are not easily pleased; different tastes, different attitudes, different desires. Most humans see the glass half empty. Most words spoken are negative. What a shame! Life is so short. Why not chose to live a positive life? Well, even those trying to live that way will be criticized. What responses will this generate? All in all I felt good after watching AWITC. The ending was weak, but overall the time spent watching was enjoyable and pleasing. A nice reminder that life with honor and self sacrifice can be rewarding. Life was not perfect in 1940 and it isn't today either, but it can be better if we choose it to be.</fullReview>

Apparently the original Italian movie has much more depressing (realistic) endUnfortunately the movie becomes very laughable towards the end which some people interpret as romantic. The fire scene is unbelievable - did they drench the vines with gas/petrol? A good tip for arsonists use vines and the place will burn within seconds. This also contradicts the earlier scene when they try to save the grapes from the frost with lots of fires burning!?Anthony Quinn is not bad in a role he's done over and over again and the lush music fits the visuals pretty well.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A really bad movie on such fundamental levels. The script is completely awful. There is no element of surprise whatsoever anywhere, you can see where it's all going to end light years before it actually happens, so there is really no need to watch the movie to the end. Something I couldn't stand doing. Keanu Reeves destroys every scene he is in, and I guess since he is the lead he also destroys the whole movie. And that is sad because there are people who really can act here, like Anthony Quinn. It just hurts to see such a good actor in the same scene as Keanu Reeves, it's like they are from two different dimensions. There are extras in this movie that act better than Reeves. That CGI Gungan that you saw a few pixels of far away in a battle scene in the end of Phantom Menace, was a more convincing actor than Keanu Reeves! There is also a scene where they "fly", flap the heat to the grapes so they don't get ruined because of the frost.WHAT PURPOSE DOES THIS SCENE SERVE?It's just silly! I sat there giggling, I mean they look like idiots! Not only that, the lead female character is prancing around in her nightgown. Wow, it must be cold! All right so Mr. director wants to show her features, but come on! This leads us to another major problem. Why should we even care about any of the persons on this vineyard at all? They're not poor, they have no debts, no nothing! A movie needs a conflict for it too be even remotely interesting! I could think of a million ways to get it a conflict and make it interesting, but hey I'm just a lowly movie fan, I shouldn't have to write this. Professional script writers should be very well aware of all this! All in all, if you like this movie I recommend the Bill and Ted movies mentioned in my one line summary. Fine pieces of cinema starring your dear Keanu Reeves.</fullReview>

Unfortunately, in the hands of this director, this is a saccharine, predictable bore with wooden characters that are more caricature than character. What's worse, the film wastes the enormous skill and potential of a host of seriously great actors, including Anthony Quinn and Giancarlo Gianini. It even wastes the unsurpassed skill of Maurice Jarre as the creator of some of Hollywood's greatest film scores (Lawrence of Arabia, Witness, A Passage to India, among others).

		<fullReview>I was very eager to watch this movie and finally had the time to watch it this afternoon. What a disappointment! The setting is picturesque, the story romantic and the characters well cast, but the screenplay is flawed. The dialogs between Paul (Keanu Reeves) and Victoria (Aitana Sanchez-Gijon) are lame and have a staccato effect which hampers the fluidity of expression. Furthermore I felt that Keanu Reeves was struggling to stay in character and match the passion exuded by Aitana. It is the minor characters who ultimately salvage the movie with their wit and colourful personalities.If you like romance with substance then this movie will disappoint you.However,the film is worth watching for its Keatsian setting oozing with passion and its few lovable minor characters.</fullReview>

On the way, he met Victoria (Aitana Sanchez) who is returning back to her family.They become friends and Victoria tells him that she is pregnant from a man and hence scared to face her family as they are very conservative. Seeing her plight, Paul decides to enter her house as her husband and desert her the next morning that will spare her from a unmarried mother status and the wrath of her family. He enters their house and become the favorite of her grandpa though her father disliked him. When he tries to leave next morning, her grandpa asks him to wait till wine harvest. During this stay both became close to each other and understood their passion for each other.The cinematography is the real hero of the movie. Each landscape has been picturized with a painter's view in mind. Musics are too nice so as the flow of the story.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A beautiful, romantic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"A Walk In the Clouds" is one of my favorite movies because of the romantic story of star-crossed lovers and the beautiful setting in the Napa Valley of California. In regard to the plot, the movie appears to be a remake of "This Earth Is Mine" of the 1950s,which starred Rock Hudson and Jean Simmons; the same plot also served as the pilot for the TV series, "Falcon Crest." It is interesting that the name of the vineyard, Las Nubes, means clouds. Even before I learned this, I believed the title suggested that people who take a walk in the clouds are close to heaven or paradise. I believe this impression is further suggested when the fog rising from the vineyard (in a panoramic shot)looks like clouds. Also, the smoke that rises from fires generated to ward off frost look like clouds, and the wings the people use to keep warm air on the grapes look like angels' wings. Hence, I believe the title has come from these fog and cloud images in the story, meaning the vineyard is a heavenly place and that those fortunate enough to live or visit there are blessed.I loved Anthony Quinn's portrayal of the classic grandfather, an earthy, philosophical man gifted with common sense and the ability to accept change. He serves as go-between and peacemaker between the seemingly star-crossed young couple and the girl's father who cannot accept change. The film also hints that the grandfather and father had the same differences and conflicts about 25 years earlier and that the grandfather still doubts his own son's worth and effort in the family wine-making business.Each time the young man Paul tries to leave the family and return to his wife, some mishap (in the style of old Greek drama plots) prevents him from doing so. The first time, the grandfather eats all Paul's chocolate samples so that Paul cannot resume work as a candy salesman; the next time, the grandmother has Paul's clothes submerged in the clothes washer so that he cannot pack up and leave. Although these delays complicate things for Paul, everything works out for the good in the end.In addition to liking the film for the romantic story, I found the Spanish-style house and the panoramic view of the vineyard incredibly beautiful. I also liked the musical soundtrack, which sounded uplifting and heavenly -- exactly as one might expect for "a walk in the clouds."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Failed attempt at a drippy romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wish I could like this movie better, I really tried to, I love a good old-fashioned four-hanky romance. It's possible that this script could have been made into a movie that requires up to two hankies, the story could have worked, but the wrong people were hired.A young man (Keanu Reeves) comes back from WWII to the wife he barely knows, and when he finds she is interested in nothing but money he aimlessly gets on a bus, where he meets a damsel in distress. A Mexican-American college girl is pregnant by a married man, and returning home to a Napa vinyard to face the music. He impulsively offers to help her, to pose as her husband and "abandon" her, so the family will accept her and her baby. Naturally, they fall in love, in spite of everything in their way...The biggest problem with this movie is of course the leading man: Keanu Reeves' cute-valley-boy appeal vanishes the instant he tries to speak a grammatical sentence. His body freezes and his face acquires a desperate stunned-bunny look, while his mouth struggles to get the words out. Instead of rooting for this sweet-but-sad young man to claim the woman he loves, you're thinking "Come on dude, you can pronounce it!"Other than that, the performances are decent-to-poor, the direction is clumsy, and the story is full of enough holes and improbabilities to injure one's suspension of disbelief. Plus, the photography inexcusably bad! I mean, if you set a romance in the beautiful Napa valley and try to make it all lush and beautiful, you've got to do better than a few shots of hillsides with an ochre filter over the lens. Hey, it looks like smog, not the famous golden light of California afternoons! How hard can it be to make the Wine Country photograph?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I just watched this film and I liked it up until the fire in which live grape vines burn to a crisp. The idea that a green grape vine would burn is absurd enough, but burn like a dry grass field is too far fetched. It would have been so much more enjoyable if there had been a drought or a flood or something more believable, instead of a fire that takes off on green plants. Aside from this, I thought the movie was enjoyable and contained a good plot. I like movies about love igniting and burning up the screen with passion that touches the whole family is just wonderful.Keanu does a great job in trying to sing Spanish and playing someone who has had too much to drink.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is a nice movies with values.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Walk in the Clouds is a nice movie. There should be more men like him. It's about True Love. They have family, you know like, the way he wants it. Like rules, like you have to respect, like obey. They have family scruples. Cause family should be together, regardless. They didn't spend that much money on the movie. The scenery was mostly of the wine field. And I like wine fields because I like wine. But the principle of the movie is to stick with the family, even though he was a strict father, they respected him.. There was a lot of respect. And in the end there was a lot of love. Today, nobody knows what love is about. People should write more about this in the New York Times.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved the movie!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not the romantic movie type.Truthfully: I hate that genre, way to pink and sweet to my taste. The only reason why I even bothered with this movie was because Keanu Reeves plays the leading role.(I have admired this actor since my early teens and I wish everybody would get of his case about his acting skills, ever heard of the phrase TYPE CASTING??) But I must admit I fell in love with the characters and the whole story. You really feel for the girl, and the predicament she's gotten into. It's admirable of Paul Sutton to want to help her out, but you know what's going to happen! I especially love the scene when they go to bed and the girls mother is 'helping' them to bed and the awkwardness that follows.I also love the scene when the family has to save the harvest by fanning the grapes with the hot air and it really hits Paul Sutton that he is in love with the girl.I did feel the final scene with the whole vineyard burning except for the root was a bit to much,it made it less believable. But the overall movie gets a definite thumbs up!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Post war love movie with grapes.....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was stuck watching this on a 5 hour flight so I had plenty of time to review and re-review this movie in my head. I guess this is a love story but I'm not sure at all how the Keana Reeves ultimately became attached to the leading lady. The gist of the story - The leading lady is pregnant and the father of the unborn child has disappeared. She has to go home with the shame and gets on a bus where she meets Keanu. They talk and Keanu decides to go with her with under the guise of meeting and making her family believe he's a bum by running out on her. However, things don't go as planned and by movie's end, they're in love and everything works out. The story to me was like mashed potatoes, all the potatoes get thrown together and you get a final product, in this case a not very cohesive movie. The point I'm getting at is that this movie does a poor job at telling it's story. It appears that the director must have took a day off and let their assistant(s) finish shooting the film. I think there are plenty of undiscovered scripts waiting to be discovered and filmed - too bad some one didn't find one to replace this yawner. I'm still puzzled about the grapes though...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the worst movies of all time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't get me wrong. I can like a good chick flick. But I hated this movie. The 5 chicks I saw it with hated this movie. Anyone I've even known that has seen this movie has said it pretty much sucked.Script was just poorly done, and even it was better than the acting. If anyone needs proof that Keanu can't act, see this movie. He's just being himself in a few others (Parenthood and Bii&amp; Ted) come to mind. But when he tries to act, the results are HORRIBLE. Quinn was a lot of fun, but not nearly enough to make up for this horrible, horrible affair.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>More sentimental Hollywood rubbish.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Terribly clichéd, awfully predictable love story, with unbearably schmaltzy dialog and a Keanu whose acting approaches catastrophic levels at times; worse than an amateur.This worthless piece of sentimental crap, Hollywood-designed for the dumb women, got full marks by Roger Ebert. The review has to be read to be believed; Ebert's text could as easily be mistaken for poetry about a lost love. He is on cloud 9 talking about this mediocrity, revealing himself to have the brain of a worm. According to him, Keanu has an "artless simplicity" ? or did he mean "a simpleton's artlessness"? He says the film is "aflame with passion" and that only those who have that quality might appreciate the film. If Ebert has any passion which is on fire then it is his passion for food. And bad movies. In that order.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beyond Awful.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am not a cynic, I love romantic movies, I'm even in the wine business. I was totally primed to like this movie, but it turned out to be beyond bad. I was looking for a romantic movie, I was on a date, this movie just about made us both puke it was so bad. The person who called it a stilted, nauseating, piece of crap was being entirely too nice. There isn't bad acting in this movie, there's no acting. Keanu Reeves couldn't get himself into the paper bag in order to fail to act his way out. The story has potential, I think the saccharine quality of the movie is perfectly OK. It's totally ruined by some of the worst acting this side of "Plan 9 From Outer Space." Everyone I've ever talked to about this movie seems to agree.It's totally unwatchable, in the top dozen of the worst movies I've ever seen.</fullReview>
