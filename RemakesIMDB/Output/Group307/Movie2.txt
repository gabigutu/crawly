		<shortDescription>A well crafted movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many fans of Satyajit Ray would recoil in revulsion on hearing that someone is attempting to remake one of the grandmasters movies. Of course 'Autograph' is not a remake of the great 'Nayak' but rather a tribute to it. Having been curious to what a movie like 'Nayak' would look today, I was contented with the brief glimpses of it throughout the movie. The movie didn't attempt to remake the complexities of the Nayak but wanted to pinch on the nostalgia of Nayak lovers. Prosenjit's rendition of Uttam Kumar's most appreciated role of Arun Chatterjee was portrayed with delicate restraint as he gently snares the audience with the bewitchery of a Superstar! Indraneil Sengupta also performed his role to a viewer's satisfaction though he did lack in consistency at points. Nandana Sen looked somewhat unsure at points but as her role wasn't as complex as the male leads, one can overlook this weakness. The music of the movie stands out the most. Songs like Beche Thakar Gaan and Amake Amar Moto Thakte Dao are both well penned and placed in the movie. Having missed the last three decades of Bengali movies, autograph presented me an excellent bridging opportunity to witness the recent development of Bangla Films.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a realistic and excellent movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It was an excellent movie,rather reality.....expressing how in today's world people forget their roots and struggle and try for cheap means to get success.moreover trust used as element also is portrayed in a critical way.Hope i will be able to watch such movies again in near future. The way a new inexperienced director is given a break but he on the contrary was unable to keep up was excellently shown. The disappearance of the theater actress at the end of the movie and its ambiguous ending also is very good.The movie title is self justifying.The shooting of the film remake within the film starts with an autograph.The movie also ends with an autograph.More such films should be made in the film industry.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film, though stemming from a novel idea, was not well-executed. The screen-play lacked conviction and the direction much needed focus. In this film in an attempt to pay tribute to one of the greatest filmmakers/auteurs of all times in the world (Satyajit Ray), Mr. Mukherjee somehow lost track of what (and how much) gravity creating such a tribute demanded. Autograph is immensely rich in its approach to film theory with its subtle references to iconic European directors and films. Sadly though, it ended up being an incomplete and incoherent melange of some unexpected and mostly predictable plot twists. The myriad of sequences remain(ed) fettered in underdeveloped video vignettes devoid of artistic momentousness. This film belied Mukherjee's capabilities as a potential avant-garde Indian filmmaker!</fullReview>
