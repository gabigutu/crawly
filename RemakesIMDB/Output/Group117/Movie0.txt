		<shortDescription>Errol Flynn's Best Performance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dawn Patrol - based on a book my John Monk Saunders is the story of a RFC squadron in France during the Great War. If has three good central performances - Basil Rathbone showing an array of hyper tense emotions - David Niven changing from a happy go lucky drunken fool to a hardened leader of men and the best, by far, Errol Flynn as a guilt ridden hero whose nerves are torn to shreds.Flynn has had so much bad press over the years and people forget that he was a great actor in the early days. This film demonstrates that superbly. There are no women in this film, no distractions. It's about men up against it, and having to watch their comrades die needlessly against overwhelming odds.The film has moments of silence, laughter, terror all mixed together with some superb skewed camera angles in the mess to give a feeling of drunken hopelessness. Flynn's relief at seeing Niven when he thought he was dead is a moving performance. His quiet moments when he talks about England, his control when trying to convince Nivens younger brother to go up for the first time - these scenes show real presence and talent. You feel for him and all around him. Coming out just before the beginning of WW2 it would have given the home audiences great understanding of what they faced - a hard and bloody task, where young men will die as surely as the older ones will order them to fight.This film should be reissued on DVD and shown around the world - it's that good. Let's write some more scripts like this and start making some decent films again.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the very best of all war films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Dawn Patrol, one of Director Eddie Goulding's very finest, is as tense and tightly wound as the characters it portrays, who face the awful question, 'what is maximum effort', how much can a man give in combat before breaking? The story revolves around the vividly drawn characters of Lt. Scott,'Scotty', played by David Niven in one of his most genuine performances, and that of his chum, Captain Courtney, well played by Errol Flynn. Together the two friends face death each day in machines held together by 'spit and baling wire' and each night drink themselves into oblivion. Their antics contrast with the concern that is eating at their commanding officer, Major Brand, wonderfully portrayed by Basil Rathbone. Brand is visibly cracking under the strain, while the oblivious Courtney and Scott play at war, seemingly unconcerned by death or anything else. Paired with Brand is the unflappable Phipps, presented by stalwart character actor Donald Crisp. It is Crisp, who is finally made to express the film's underlying anti-war theme, questioning the point of sending all the fine young men to their deaths, "...and for what?", he asks though no answer is forthcoming. The tension is expertly broken by comic interludes of genuine hilarity as well as great scenes of World War air combat. One sees a reflection of Renoir's 'Rules of the Game', when a German pilot, who is thought to have killed Scotty, is brought in to meet Courtney, who shot him down and they show each other the mutual respect and chivalry that still crossed the no-mans land between the two sides. Like '12 0'Clock High'its World War II counterpart, this film puts the viewer under the skins of these men as they face death. No phony posturing or heroics, no masks, just humanity faced with something which, ultimately is inhuman. This intelligent and questioning film is at the very top of my list of great war films, and is an absolute must see for new generations of movie goers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flynn shines in serious drama of WWI aviators...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>DAWN PATROL was a forerunner of the "men facing war" kind of dramas that became a steady source of entertainment in books and films of the decades that followed, particularly after WWII.But this takes place during World War I in 1915, when aviation was still young and men in the flying machines were sent into battle against greater odds than anyone could imagine.Basil Rathbone plays the commander breaking under pressure who has to see young men under his command die in battle against the Germans. He is delighted to be relieved of his command by the young flier who has been chiding him for sending inexperienced men into battle--Errol Flynn. Flynn soon finds himself hounded by the same sort of pressures facing Rathbone. His best friend (David Niven) is a fun loving pal who has a change of heart when his younger brother (well played by Morton Lowry), turns up for immediate duty despite a scant amount of training. Under Flynn's orders, the boy goes into battle the following day and is killed. This event sets up the dramatic conclusion which has Flynn willing to sacrifice himself and single-handedly take on a most dangerous mission across enemy lines.Edmund Goulding keeps the story going from one excellent scene to another and all of the performances are first rate. Donald Crisp is less stuffy than usual in a good supporting role.But it's Errol Flynn who makes the strongest impression in a role that calls for some fine moments of acting. His emotions seem genuine and his performance is crisp and mature. Indeed, one of his best performances in a well written role.The ultimate message of the film is the anguish and futility of war and it comes across without being preachy. Definitely a Flynn film that is well worth watching.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Flynn in Excellent Drama of WWI Aviators...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>THE DAWN PATROL, Errol Flynn's final film of his busiest year as an actor (1938), is a fascinating counterpoint to his usual swashbuckling and light comic roles. A remake of Howard Hawks' 1930 classic, this is a tale of war-weary WWI aviators, called upon to risk their lives daily, in broken-down aircraft, on missions they consider impossible (a timeless war theme that would reappear in such WWII classics as COMMAND DECISION and TWELVE O'CLOCK HIGH). Directed by WWI veteran Edmund Goulding, best known for his big-budget romances (GRAND HOTEL), the film counterpoints the gritty, harsh realities on the ground with the nearly surreal quality of early air battles, as bi-planes with open cockpits whirl and swoop like insects, and enemy airmen would occasionally drop out possessions of dead pilots over airfields, in a chivalrous gesture.Fellow pilots Courtney and Scott (portrayed by real-life friends Flynn and David Niven, again showing the rapport they had demonstrated so effectively in 1936's THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE) are battle-tested veterans, hell-raising survivors of a squadron decimated by the war. Seeing a constant influx of 'green' kids replacing lost friends, and knowing too well that the rookies' inexperience will quickly cost them their lives, the pair vent their anger against their commander, the coldly 'by-the-book' Maj. Brand (in a remarkable performance by frequent Flynn nemesis, Basil Rathbone). Courtney constantly condemns and belittles Maj. Brand, accusing him of placing 'The Mission' over the lives of the men under his command, which makes Courtney a hero in the eyes of the fliers.Finally, Brand cracks, and is approved for reassignment, and Courtney is chosen to replace him. In a powerful scene, Brand lets his cold 'facade' down, and reveals, bitterly, to the younger man that seeing his men sent on suicide missions, daily, had literally crushed him. Unknown to the squadron, Brand had constantly begged HQ to ease up, but had been 'shot down' each time, as the missions were essential. "Now it's YOUR turn," Brand sneers, "See how YOU enjoy it!"Brand's words are prophetic, as Courtney quickly discovers himself in the same situation, as the despised scapegoat, with Scott assuming the role of spokesperson and savior to the squadron. And the most dangerous mission yet has just come down from HQ...DAWN PATROL is a powerful film, with great performances from the entire cast, particularly Flynn, who had often begged the WB to give him roles beyond his 'swashbuckler' image. The critical praise it garnered proved Flynn's versatility as an actor (although public demand would keep him 'locked' into adventure films), and raised David Niven up to 'star' status.It remains one of the BEST films about the 'Great War', and shouldn't be missed!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting &amp; Anguishing Film About "the next man who dies"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I first saw this movie when I was 16, and didn't understand a lot of its subtleties; I just thought it was an exciting &amp; dramatic war film with a lot of great flying sequences. I caught it again when I was 34 and was surprised at its depth.I like to watch this movie whenever my own job gets crazy and hectic, with unrealistic deadlines and insufficient support, because it reminds me that I really don't have it so bad after all. The men in this movie were sent up daily in obsolete equipment in a bad state of disrepair; as the film progressed the squadron had about a 70% turnover as the combat veterans were shot down and replaced by green kids whose limited training could not possibly have prepared them for what they would face.The characters are all dissected, even lesser, supporting roles receive excellent character studies, and the stars of course are downright fascinating. It's a thrill to learn that Errol Flynn (Captain Courtney) really could act, as well as just jump around and wave a sword; David Niven is wonderfully innocent and almost childlike as "Scotty," and Basil Rathbone, a truly great actor who seldom got the chance to strut his stuff since he was usually typecast as a "bad guy" or as Sherlock Holmes, gives a nerve-wrenching performance as Major Brand, who's floundering under the strain. He proves a profound point -- it is often easier to go to your own death than to order others to do so, a lesson Captain Courtney and Lt. Scott must reluctantly learn as well.I'm now 44, and have seen this movie a couple dozen times, but it never ages. The flying sequences are still exciting; the chivalry and wild antics of the fliers never becomes tiresome or old, and the anguish of war is still as heartbreaking. Truly a movie that will last.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Since the aerial stuff was already done.............................</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warner Brothers more than most of the other major studios had a habit of simply recycling the old plots of their films and repackaging them. A good example would be the boxing film Kid Galahad remade a few years later as The Wagons Roll at Night with the setting now changed to a circus. But in this case we didn't get a remake of The Dawn Patrol, we got practically a carbon copy.I finally saw the original The Dawn Patrol that was made in 1930 by Howard Hawks and found that this film was practically a word for word remake of the Hawks classic. Of course it was no surprise to learn that all the aviation sequences were just lifted bodily from the first film, but probably more than that was done. Several long-shots looked exactly the same.In a way this might have worked out because director Edmund Goulding who was not known for action films could concentrate on the actors and he got very good performances out of Errol Flynn, David Niven, and Basil Rathbone who step into the parts that Richard Barthelmess, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Neil Hamilton did the first time around.Still after seeing first one version, than the other, one might be complaining of double vision at that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Basil's Satisfactory Revenge On Errol</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have often felt that had history been kinder there would have been no major wars affecting the globe after 1918. The pacifist spirit that hit most of the states in the west was due to the size of the casualty rates suffered by the major states in the war. It was sufficient to cause massive re-considerations by the U.S., England, and France about military cut-backs, and (in fact) in 1921 the Washington Naval Conference did lead to the top allied powers (six actually - they included little Belgium) to reduce the size of their navies were based on proportions. In 1925 there was a "spirit of Locarno" as France and Germany under Aristide Briand and Gustave Stresseman began a road to rapprochement. In 1928 Briand and U.S. Secretary of State Frank Kellogg created the Kellogg-Briand Pact outlawing warfare (which is still used as the basis for war crimes trials).Of course the rise of Fascist, Nazi, and Communist regimes and the great depression wrecked the entire pacifist movement. Mussolini, Hitler, and the Japanese felt pacifist views mirrored weakness, and dismissed them. And the resulting war of 1939 - 1945 was more bloody and horrifying than the Great War had been. And even that war has not been the last one of the 20th or 21st Centuries.One reflection of the pacifism and hatred of war is found in the movies and plays of the inter-war years, like THE ROAD TO GLORY which showed the bloodshed and uselessness of the trench warfare in France (it is worthy to watch that film with PATHS OF GLORY to see how hopeless that trench warfare was). Other films like this were JOURNEY'S END, THE EAGLE AND THE HAWK, and this film, DAWN PATROL.DAWN PATROL tells the story of a British aerodrome on the western front. It is commanded by Major Brand (Basil Rathbone - in one of his most human roles). Brand's two best fighter pilots are Captain Courtney (Errol Flynn) and Lieutenant Scott (David Niven). Both of them tend to create there own rules but they do a spectacular job at fighting the Germans effectively. Rathbone, however, has dozens of other young pilots who are sent to the aerodrome, but become fodder for the German fighter pilots. Flynn and Niven keep knocking him about this - they feel he has no real feelings, and so he is beneath contempt as a bloody butcher. They don't realize that Rathbone actually hates sending up these young boys to die. When alone or with his assistant Phipps (Donald Crisp) he shows the strain which for the sake of the company's morale he hides elsewhere. He tries to find ways to reduce the problem. One way is rigid adherence to the rules (which is another reason Flynn and Niven despise him).Then, after one of their escapades does substantial damage to the Germans, Flynn and Niven are amazed to find that Rathbone's normal threats of court-martial is dimmed by a telephone call that leaves him temporarily speechless and then laughing hysterically. Headquarters was so impressed by what Flynn and Niven did that they are promoting Rathbone to Colonel, and sending him to the headquarters staff (so he does not have to be so emotionally torn anymore). But best, he is given the power to choose his successor. He promotes Flynn to Major and commander of the aerodrome, and Niven to Captain.Flynn starts going through the tortures of the damned now. He did not expect this action, and he is not ready for sending young boys (including Morton Lowry as Niven's brother) to their death. Naturally the friendship with Niven suffers - especially after the death of Lowry. Rathbone returns a few months later - and finds Flynn is no longer so devil-may-care nor as critical (how can he be - he knows better now). Rathbone is not jubilant at the success of his revenge - he notes it quietly. This is the only Flynn - Rathbone film where Basil came out on top, and it wasn't by fighting with swords.The film shows how the war machine just mindlessly ground up a whole generation of youth in Europe. Only by being aware of the proper tricks of aerial warfare (which took months) did any pilot stand a chance of survival. But the turnover rate was due to the stupid view that massive numbers of men (even poorly trained ones) would guarantee the victory of the Allies in the skies (or on land for that matter).The film has a very realistic feel of what that dreadful situation was like. Even the use of a fictionalized Von Richtofen (Von Richter here) suggests the reality. Von Richtofen (and the German air force, for that matter) had a better training method than the allies until 1918. Until the Red Baron died the Germans did control the skies for the most part.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't have a lot to say about this movie. Errol Flynn is excellent as Captain Courtney, and the rest of the cast is excellent in their roles. That didn't surprise me. What surprised me was two things. First, how the British flying aces in World War I contend with the harsh realities of war, specifically the deaths of their friends and the decisions that had to be made to send more men to their deaths (excellently portrayed by Basil Rathbone as Major Brand). Whats most impressive, however, is how engaging the air sequences were. They were ahead of their time and they hold up rather well today. I just saw Pearl Harbour, and I would say the Dawn Patrol is more exciting. It holds up well today, and if you get a chance, give it a watch. 8 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brave young pilots who defended their country in WW1</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A very action-packed drama about First World War British flyers and the risky aerial fighting they undertook. So many young pilots rose to the challenge but flew off in matchstick planes to face a deadly enemy in the sky. We share with them the revelries and tragedies met daily by this small group of flyers, most of whom didn't come back.It's wonderful to see so many superb actors in a modern day setting for a change, playing in modern wartime roles -- a nice change from the usual pirate pics and westerns we've known them for.Aviation during WW1 was a time of raw courage, luck, and a devil-may-care outlook on life. Errol Flynn, as Captain Courtney, reflects aloud in some pensive moments about the futility of waging war but it's a brutal reality and must be dealt with, which he does so bravely.David Niven, as Scotty, turns in a good supportive performance and in the end of the story learns to take on a commander's responsibilities. Actually, in real life Niven also rejoined the army in WW2 and acquired honors along the way, still retaining his popularity in movies during and after the war."How many fine chaps will die in this war and in future wars?" -- lines spoken by Phipps (Donald Crisp) seem to warn of the oncoming Second World War. Now in our new century let's hope we never see those clouds of war on such an enormous scale hanging over England and Europe ever again. An excellent film on heroism in wartime.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An excellent film about the anguish commanders have when sending pilots into battle and how the pilots cope with their fear and anger.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wartime commanders have the nasty job of sending men to do battle, often resulting in their death. In this film, flight commander Basil Rathbone gets telephone orders from the high command for the morning flights, and relays these to squadron commander Errol Flynn, who has the unenviable job of picking the men for the job. Complaining about the men's inexperience or the rickety planes does no good, since it is their duty to do as they are told, and everyone obeys. On this particular day, Flynn has to pick two replacement pilots who have little experience, which often means their death. It was odd to hear one pilot who was not picked remark "Lucky devils" as the two who were picked entered their planes, when I thought "Poor devils." This show of bravado seems to be just a mask for their fear. We hear the men often singing a song with a last line ending "Hoorah for the next man who dies."I never fully understood the relationship enemy pilots had with one another in films set during WWI. They often did not behave as hated enemies, but rather as part of an elite club. There is a telling and very dramatic scene where a downed and captured German pilot, Carl Esmond, is brought into the quarters where the pilots gather to drink and sing. He was the one who shot down David Niven, thought to be dead, and was, in turn, shot down by Flynn. Flynn's face turns grim as he walks toward the man who he thought just killed his best friend. It looked like Flynn was going to take a poke at him, but he smiles, takes his hand and drinks a toast with him. Only Peter Willes, whose two friends were recently killed in combat, lets his true feelings surface as he lunges at Esmond and has to be forcibly restrained. He then blasts at Flynn: "You laugh with him - joke with him - a man that just murdered your best friend. He's dead! You know that, don't you! Don't you! And so is Blaine and Madchen, my best friends. They're dead! They aren't coming home anymore! I believe you've forgotten Scotty already." These were my sentiments exactly (and probably the writer's). When Niven walks in very much alive and meets the man who nearly killed him, they hug and drink a toast together!As fate would have it, the realities of possible death shake up both Flynn and Niven. Flynn is made flight commander and is ordered to put every available man in the air to stave off a big push by the Germans. And one of the new replacements is Niven's kid brother, Morton Lowry, with only nine hours of training experience. Nivens pleads with Flynn not to send him up, but there can be no exceptions and orders must be followed. To make matters worse, the feared German flying ace, Von Richter (Norman Willis), has joined the German flying force. Lowry didn't have a chance, and his death causes a deep rift in Niven's and Flynn's friendship. It is mended weeks later when Niven volunteers for a near suicide mission to fly alone and bomb a German armament dump 60 kilometers inside the German lines. Flynn gets Niven drunk and goes in his place, but three German planes, including one piloted by Von Richter, goes after him.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Superior clone of the 1930 version</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a stirring and exciting story of the courage shown by pilots who know they or their friends will likely be killed on one of their missions, and the anguish their commanders feel when sending them to their deaths. Set on the battlefields of WWI, the plot duplicates the 1930 version starring Douglass Fairbanks, Jr. In fact, whole sequences (especially flying scenes and the climactic attack) were lifted directly from the earlier film. (Note: although the 1930 version was originally entitled "Flight Command," and is occasionally screened under that title by TCM, IMDb also calls it "Dawn Patrol," probably to distinguish it from the 1940 Robert Taylor "Flight Command" about Navy pilots.) Although it's a close call, I would recommend this later film over its predecessor, for the superior performances of the lead actors. Errol Flynn (as Dick Courtney) was more involving than 1930's Richard Barthelmess, a veteran actor whose performance retains the somewhat stilted quality of the silent film era. While Douglas Fairbanks Jr. was excellent in the 1930 version as pilot Doug Scott, David Niven in the same role positively sparkles in several more light-hearted, even comedic scenes. And although Neil Hamilton played Major Brand well in the original film, at least early on in the story, the role calls for a less-sympathetic performance, and who could be less sympathetic than Basil Rathbone at his sneery best?Furthermore, current (as of 2012) releases of 1930's "Flight Command / Dawn Patrol" are not as visually clear in all scenes as the later version, and also have a lot of scratchy sounds and low rumble in the soundtrack, which are especially distracting in quieter scenes. Hopefully, remastered versions of both films will someday be available.Still, this is only nit-picking, as both the 1930 and 1930 versions of "Dawn Patrol" are excellent. But given the choice, go with Flynn and Niven of 1938.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Dawn Patrol flies high</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of the very few classic World War I adventures, the work of swashbuckling Errol Flynn, the staid, villainous Basil Rathbone and David Niven who transcends from Flynn's light-hearted sidekick to a combative inferior officer light up the skies over enemy territory.The carefree camaraderie bolstered by excessive drinking in the face of certain doom provides an uplifting theme. I particularly like the songs they sing as they belly up to the bar, most notably, "Hurrah for the Next Man that Dies." The dogfights in the biplanes of that era are so vivid because you can see the pilots' every move, and they can see each other -- the thumbs-up when one of them is shot to pieces and about to plummet to his death.The film captures the reality of a war that history tends to overlook more and more as time goes on. It should go down as one of the classics of the era.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Here's to the Next Man that Dies..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Dawn Patrol" came out at a strange time: a few years later and it would have been a product of Warner Bros' propaganda department, matching a vicious enemy against selfless heroes. But in 1938 war was still a long way from Hollywood, so instead we get one of the last great anti-war films of the Golden Age.The cast, as usual, is superlative. Errol Flynn and David Niven are friends and drinking buddies (in real life as well as on screen) in the Royal Flying Corps, straining against the strict discipline of their commanding officer, Basil Rathbone. Rathbone gets a different sort of role: rather than the sneering villain, he portrays a sympathetic character torn apart by his duty to his superiors and his responsibility to the men he commands. In fact, the same dramatic arc afflicts Flynn and Niven in time, and the three great actors turn in some of the best performances of their careers.The flying scenes of "Dawn Patrol" lack the scale of "Hell's Angels" or "Wings", and a lot of scenes were lifted directly from a 1930 film of the same name, directed by Howard Hawks. The California scenery distracts a little from the verisimilitude, but the squadrons of vintage Nieuport 28's and other aircraft should make up for any shortcomings in the locations. The meat of the story takes place on the ground -- unlike in "Hell's Angels" -- so the action scenes in the air serve more as punctuation marks.Like previous First World War movies, "Dawn Patrol" portrays the cynicism and fatalism of the fighter pilots. They drink a toast to "the next man that dies", sing boisterous songs to bury their grief, and even welcome an enemy captive into their mess -- who cares whose side he's on, the war's over for him, so let's get drunk. There's a lot of manly horseplay and fooling around, and probably a bottle of brandy in every scene, making for a heck of a drinking game. The awful truth of the war is hammered home in scenes of youthful recruits arriving fresh from their public schools, brimming with childish bravado, ready for a great adventure -- and totally ignorant of the fate that awaits them.</fullReview>

Strong supporting cast helps with Basil Rathbone standing out as a man who understands but is troubled by the weight of his duty even while others do not and is compassionate enough when the that weight has shifted to offer solace. David Niven's star moved much higher with his performance here, it would still be a few years before he moved into the top ranks but he was done with unimportant roles from this point on.

		<shortDescription>Good Remake, but not better</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In France for service in the Great War (aka World War I), handsome pilot Errol Flynn (as Dick Courtney) and pal David Niven (as Doug "Scotty" Scott) clash with commander Basil Rathbone (as Drake Brand) over his decisions to send young fliers out on suicide missions in rickety planes. But, with the Germans active nearby, Mr. Rathbone has limited options. Taking the lead, Mr. Flynn decides to go over Rathbone's head, completing a foolish mission with Mr. Niven co-piloting. Rathbone threatens to have him court-martialed, but a worse fate awaits Flynn ? he is quickly promoted to commander of "The Dawn Patrol". Now in charge, Flynn must order young fliers out on suicide missions in rickety planes...This is close re-make of the Warner Bros. own "The Dawn Patrol" (1930), with its most exciting aerial footage simply flown in (figuratively) from the previous film. While a more crude production, the earlier film is superior. The 1930 version captures the story's sense of war dread far better. In the original, a sense of doom permeates everything, even when the characters are having a good time. Original stars Richard Barthelmess (as Courtney) and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. (as Scott) acted like characters trying to drown the horror of war by carousing in drink. They seemed tortured. Here, at times, Flynn and Niven look more like actors having fun with their roles. An exception, Rathbone keeps a serious foundation.****** The Dawn Patrol (12/23/38) Edmund Goulding ~ Errol Flynn, David Niven, Basil Rathbone, Donald Crisp</fullReview>

The nobility and bravery of these fliers would continue, but the negative psychological effects of men in war and the philosophical discussion of war itself would have to wait until the war that came after the war to end all wars.There are some outstanding aerial bombing scenes and dogfights (from the original 1930 Howard Hawks film) and the remake script called for some difficult acting and the entire cast delivers. Some say this is Errol Flynn's best performance and showed his seldom used ability to deliver a great real role with emotion and humanism, and that he was more than a handsome star with a seductive smile.</fullReview>

The pilot was Gene Austin, stunt pilot, delayed jump record holder 1935 and member of the flying team, I think they were called Hell's Angels (title of another movie) in this picture. Hughes used the same sequence in 3 pictures marketed in 1933. The stunt placed a dynamite charge in the nose of the aircraft which had a delay to ignite to be activated as the pilot left the cockpit. As the story was later published, the charge exploded just as the pilot had his foot on the seat to exit, was blown out of the plane and luckily was awake enough to open his chute. Gene Austin's scrap book and other docs are in the SanDiego Aerospace Museum. Gene Austin was born 4/06/1900 and died 7/9/52 of a cerebral hemorrhage.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great WW1 drama</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Great WW1 flying drama. A remake of Howard Hawks' "The Dawn Patrol" (1930) (sometimes known as "Flight Commander"). Not sure why it needed to be remade - it was great as it was.This version doesn't add anything. Plot is almost to-the-letter identical to the original. Flying sequences and cinematography here are about as good, even though this movie was made 8 years later.Not that there's anything wrong with this movie. Still a very gritty and accurate look at life, and death, in a Royal Flying Corps (RFC) fighter squadron. Details fairly well the burden of command, of sending pilots to almost certain death.One area where this version trumps the original is in the performances. The original's performances weren't bad, but weren't great either. Here the performances are superb, especially from Errol Flynn, David Niven and Basil Rathbone.As said, not sure why this was (re)made, but a great movie nevertheless.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's a rotten job, but someone has to do it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Having not seen the Howard Hawks original made in 1930, I obviously have no frame of reference as regards if this remake does that particular film justice, but the evidence here suggests this Errol Flynn led piece can justifiably hold its head up high.It's World War 1 and we are in the company of the 59th Squadron in France, these brave airmen are the dawn patrol, the men {boys} who fly the most dangerous missions at the crack of dawn, this squadron has a high mortality rate such is the perilous nature of their duty. Capt. Courtney, Lt. Scott, and Maj. Brand are the main characters of the piece, and all three men are faced with mounting tensions and perhaps the spectre of impending tragedy?This film is one of those pieces that drives home the harshness of war whilst pumping the blood at the bravery of those involved. Here we witness young men literally ecstatic at the chance to get up in the air and fight the enemy; and this with very few hours actual flight experience behind them. It becomes like a production line of cannon fodder, and this is not lost on the superior characters in the film. The film perfectly portrays the futility of it all by leaving us in no doubt about the insane approach from those sitting in their comfy chairs, barking orders with no care for the graveness that the squadron faces. The men while away their hours drinking and singing startlingly revealing songs, full of bravado and gusto for the war effort, and it's the courage and loyalty of these guys that drives the film's emotional heart.A wonderful cast lifts this piece to a very high standard, Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone and David Niven firmly grasp the characters essential points, and coupled with a very astute piece of pacing from director Edmund Goulding, the film plays out perfectly. It's got the derring-do flying sequences, where some of the overhead bomb drop shots are wonderful, but be under no allusion here, this film is about the characters who are tough in fortitude, to which the ending is as good as it gets for the genre because it jolts you back to the whole sorry point of it all. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I first saw the film as an eight-nine year old boy...and wanted to be a pilot....and became one in the USAF...over the years I've revisited the film for the story..and the inspiration. Not only the acting, excellent, but the reality of the stress of commanding an outfit where your actions may result in the deaths of others. And of course the camaraderie of those linked by their time and place in a struggle...and then there was the one time gallantry of those who fought. The captured German pilot being treated as he was...and the return of the pilots cap and goggles speak of another time. Few films will reach the level of truly honorable conduct displayed here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Errol Flynn and David Niven and the rest--how could you possibly resist?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is an extremely well-made WWI aviator film. The flying sequences are excellent and realistic, the story keeps your attention throughout, the direction is good and the actors are at their best. This is a great example of the type of movies Warner Brothers was capable of making--maybe not quite as elegant as those from MGM, but certainly highly entertaining and filled with their old standby actors (in this case Flynn). Along with the ever-exciting to watch Flynn are David Niven (providing wonderful support), Basil Rathbone and Donald Crisp. What a cast! Now if the movie had any shortcoming it might be argued that the material is a bit familiar--you know, guys risking and living beside death and all the accompanying tensions. BUT, it's not just the broad plot outline that make up the movie and everything else is just so well executed you can overlook this minor aspect of the film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As indicated, David Niven is thought dead by Flynn and Rathbone. Shortly thereafter, while Flynn and Esmond are drinking, Niven walks in with a couple of bottles of champagne. The look on Errol Flynn's face and the laughing by Niven seemed so natural that I've always wondered if the script called for Flynn to actually believe that Niven was to die and be written out of the film at that point, so when Niven returned, it looked realistic for Flynn to be totally surprised. Kind of like a joke on Errol Flynn.Great film, I could watch it over and over.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Terrific war drama about RFC flyers in WWI France and the dangers and hardships they faced. Excellent cast led by the trio of Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone, and David Niven. Some of the best performances from each man's career. Some fine support by the likes of Donald Crisp and Barry Fitzgerald. One thing you can always count on from Warner Bros. in the '30s and '40s is their exceptional stable of actors. The plot may seem a bit familiar but it's helped by great performances, a quality script, and good direction from Edmund Goulding. It's a remake of a 1930 film that I haven't seen yet so I can't compare the two but I can definitely recommend you see this one.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The Dawn Patrol stands out as my personal favourite of all WW1 films and also the best in Air warfare films. The plot is at once appealing and filled with wartime adventure. Two classmates from England enlist in the RFC and grow up in a short span (unusually a long period during the early years of the Great War) to become flying aces. Their daredevil aerobatics are admired and envied secretly by their stern commander Basil Rathbone who the duo nick-name as Killer brand as his duties are generally limited to send raw pilots against the war seasoned German Air Force. the plot is not far from depicting actual events of that period as one may read about the actions of pilots in the real RFC or Lafayette Escadrille and also the Red Baron. The stress of command thrust upon one of the friends strains and later destroys the friendship. It later is bonded in the untimely death of the Flight Commander who tricks his pal to undertake a suicide mission. Errol Flynn as the hero plays the part of the happy-go-lucky and later highly stressed commander with perfection. David Niven is adequate as the pal but it is Basil Rathbone who walks away with top honours as the original Flight Commander who envies the daredevil pilots while hating himself for sending raw pilots to their death. The scene where he hands over command to Flynn is excellent. Another actor worth mentioning here would be Donal Crisp who has the last word about the futility of war and the loss of valuable lives - certainly a line that does not age as it is relevant even today. This film is one of the rare ones that is entirely male and only hints at females but does not show them on screen. Edmund Gouldings direction is far superior to that of the earlier version but then he is helped by Errols strong charisma. On my list of the 100 movies one should see in his/her lifetime</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The War To End All Wars</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unfortunately this was not the war to end all wars and the world was on the brink of WWII when this film was made. It revisits the horror of the slaughter of WWI and in this case, concentrates on the British flying aces of the air. It's a study in contrasts but underneath the camaraderie and black humor of the pilots, lies the bitterness and futility of their job. Sent on doomed missions, they were fodder for the war machine.The British cast is excellent and contains most of the British actors then working in Hollywood film........(the only person missing is C. Aubrey Smith). Errol Flynn proves here that he can act and has great support from David Niven, Basil Rathbone and Donald Crisp. Also present are Barry Fitzgerald and Melville Cooper. Both Flynn and Rathbone are given a chance to show their serious side as they are faced with sending green recruits to certain death against a superior German air force, led by von Richter (von Richtofen I suppose).This is an excellent film and director Edward Goulding may be forgiven for lifting the extremely realistic dogfight scenes from the 1930 original starring Richard Barthelmess (also a film worth watching). I highly recommend it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Young British fliers become defenders of the sky.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Exciting and equally dark, this remake of Howard Hawks's original(1930) starring Douglas Fairbanks, Jr. This World War I drama finds Basil Rathbone as Major Brand, the ruthless commander of a squadron of British fliers. Capt. Courtney(Errol Flynn)and Lt. 'Scotty' Scott(David Niven)are hard drinking aces that beg Brand for more time to train new pilots. Brand doesn't like losing his fliers, but is forced by his own superiors to keep pushing the green pilots beyond their abilities. Brand turns his command over to Courtney. Will the camaraderie remain the same, or will Capt. Courtney become as disliked as Brand? Director Edmund Goulding makes extensive use of the breathtaking aerial combat scenes used in the original. Terrific movie. Flynn and Rathbone are dynamic together. Other players include: Barry Fitzgerald, Donald Crisp, Melville Cooper and Carl Esmond.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Some recent anti-War movies have made the meat-grinder analogy quite literal . . .</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>. . . but Warner Bros. was hardly subtle in 1938 with this ode to Pacifism. Rather than foreshadowing Warner's CAPTAINS OF THE CLOUDS (micromanaged by War-time censors four years later), DAWN PATROL could be more aptly titled DEAD DUCKS DOWN. As mid-level officers grouse amongst themselves, the Royal Air Force sends a constant stream of fresh meat (in the form of teenagers with LESS than 10 hours of flight time) to the front lines, oblivious to the fact that 75% of them are dying on their first combat mission. No doubt a source of inspiration a few years later for the Japanese Kamikazi pilots of WWII, this "Lost Generation" is figuratively marched off a cliff, abetted by a virtual news vacuum in the Pre-Twitter days. Thanks to American heroes such as Zuckerberg and Snowden, a Western government would be hard put to stampede its Youth like mindless lemmings running off cliffs nowadays. Furthermore, since the U.S. was in a De Facto state of war with Japan in 1941, it's hard to view DAWN PATROL's two "heroic" sneak attacks on military ground targets as some sort of moral high ground above Pearl Harbor. If the post-Kitty Hawk military has any true heroes left, it's surely the folks on the ground who keep soldiering away despite knowing that sneaky aerial attacks can occur at any time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Hurrah for the next man who dies."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>There's a scene in the movie that made me stop and think - it's when Major Brand (Basil Rathbone) receives congratulations from his high command for his flyers taking out the German drone. For a length of time, Rathbone, Errol Flynn, David Niven and Donald Crisp are all on screen together at the same time. All great actors with tons of great work between them and here, captured for a moment in time, they're in the company of one another. A rare moment and a veritable treat for cinema fans.For all it's heroics, this World War I film is positioned as much an anti-war film as any modern day epic like "The Deer Hunter" or "Platoon". It's got new recruits reporting to battle with as little as nine hours of flight time, and probably as much life remaining once they take to the skies on their first mission. Watching a film almost eighty years old does nothing to assure us that fighting men of an earlier era were better prepared or equipped than those of today. The same gripes still apply.I was intrigued by some of the ideas presented here and it made me wonder if events depicted in the story could have actually happened. Like German Ace Von Richter taunting the Brits by dropping a pair of boots from his plane with the message 'safer on the ground'. Or how about Scotty (Niven) making the save for Courtney (Flynn) after his plane went down on the strafing run? Perhaps even more unbelievable was Courtney and the pilot Von Mueller (Carl Esmond) toasting each other after the German's plane was shot down and he was captured. All rather incongruous elements in a war picture to be sure.The one thing you probably won't be prepared for though are the planes themselves. One shudders to think that men went to war in rickety bi-planes like the ones in the picture and men actually lived to tell about it. No high tech wizardry or laser guided missiles here, just the sheer guts and stamina required to defeat an enemy and make it back home safely and in one piece. It makes you wonder how they did it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What can you say, Errol Flynn, can't get much better as that. Absolutely great actor. Maybe not perfect for each roll but he plays these type of action "hero" roles very well. B &amp; W movie that of course shows it's age. CGI did not exist, techniques to make scenes realism to a believable level were unknown yet. But this does not distract from creating an atmosphere where you take the imperfections as they are. The story is not all about action, hero's, it's a lot also about emotions, horrors of war, horrors of loosing good close friends and family. It's about WW I where not that much movies are still circulating. Watch it with an open mind, know that scenes will look fake, but take in the story and learn about WW I where good was fighting evil, although it was not always clear who evil was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's Top Gun time! You know the drill-Errol Flynn, Basil Rathbone and David Niven take on the Red Baron (von Richter my eye!) in WWI France, w/ high doses of carousing, drunkenness, young recruits trotted out wayy too early for their own good as cannonfodder, and of course, Errol doing what Errol always does-take on the the world and (pretty much) come out grinning.Well okay, not this time-winds up a glorious death instead-but you know how I mean. I enjoyed the stunts, the shots of the bombs falling, hitting and the explosions then surging back upwards at the camera--amazingly well done considering the age of the movie.Don't think for a second that George Lucas hasn't seen this, either.Oh, the acting-pretty much what you'd expect. The stock characters-including Barry Fitzgerald being Oirish and Melville Cooper a stiff upper lipper--all there. By all means check it out.

		<shortDescription>Bloody Hell!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Fast-paced yarn of the Royal Flying Corps in 1915 France. The crates are falling apart, the death rate grows apace, but the seasoned fliers keep a stiff upper lip and all that. Flynn and Niven are two of the aviators under Squadron Commander Basil Rathbone. Everyone seems to be having a good time, except when they're being shot to pieces, except Rathbone who has been turned into a bundle of nerves by his responsibility for sending men up to die in those fragile crates.Rathbone is promoted out, and Flynn is made commanding officer. Now the burden rests with him and he gives up his profligate ways. Niven's brother arrives fresh out of flight school and Flynn, following orders, sends him on a mission from which he doesn't return. Riddled with guilt, Flynn flies a suicide mission, blows up a huge ammunition dump, and downs a couple of enemy planes before he himself is killed by von Richter, the ace. Niven is promoted to command and the whole lousy cycle begins again.(Kids: This story is about what we call "World War One." That's the war that came before "World War Two." The British were fighting against the Germans. The US entered the war late, on the side of the British. PS: We won.) The performances are okay, but the story now seems pretty dated, what with its heavy moral message in tow -- war is hell. I suppose it's an anti-war movie. The drunken recreation between missions is desperate and frantic. And in a climactic speech after Flynn's death, Donald Crisp as the adjutant spells it all out for us. The war is savage and destructive, just as the next one will be. Crisp might have done us all a greater favor if he'd explained exactly why it is that we feel compelled to get into another Big One every twenty years or so.But never mind that. Some exciting flying scenes here -- grafted on, I gather, from the earlier version of "Dawn Patrol", directed by Howard Hawks. Edmund Goulding's direction here is pedestrian. This territory belongs to Hawks or William Wellman or maybe Merian C. Cooper. (Perhaps the best WWI flying film is "The Blue Max," which is a different story, a little confused, but captures the thrill of flying exquisitely.) The script leaves something to be desired. It now seems formulaic, though it may not have seemed so to audiences of the time. Events follow one another at a rapid and predictable tempo. No sooner is David Niven's younger brother mentioned early on, than we know he's going to show up as a novice member of the squadron. Flynn's death came as something of a surprise, though. The schematic diagram calls for his successful return to base -- wounded, and with his airplane shot to pieces, but alive.And the scenes of drunken men between missions, singing "Hurrah For The Next Man to Die," fall flat. The drunkenness I can grasp, but the hilarity, no -- no matter how forced I understand it to be. Anyway, if you lose a young friend, you don't get happy if you drink. You get morose and have a crying jag. Freud was often wrong, but he was probably right when he said that grief work must be done. Paul Rosenblatt's content analysis of diaries shows that it doesn't disappear all at once, nor does it subside monotonically over time. The intensity of mourning does go down, but the decline is interrupted by irregular peaks, prompted by anniversaries, the discovery of a forgotten letter, or something. What we see here is the kind of grief work a screenwriter thinks up to help a story along.Not to bash the movie, though. It's enjoyable enough in its old-fashioned way, and the moral message, though trite, is sound enough.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Flying aces go out on World War 1 missions, while they know that many of them shall not return, especially the younger inexperienced pilots.Basil Rathbone is the squadron leader who appears to be sadistic in handing out the assignments. David Niven and Errol Flynn are at his throat regarding this. To get even with them, when Rathbone is promoted, he recommends Flynn as his replacement. Who comes along? Niven's younger brother, inexperienced and ready to fly. Obviously, Niven doesn't want him up in the air but there is nothing that Flynn can do. We have to follow orders, and it's duty above all. You don't have to be a wizard to next guess what occurs and who is blamed for this.Flynn takes to the skies to since he is upset with what happened to Niven's brother.This patriotic movie is a good one but is quite obvious from beginning to end.Interesting that this 1938 film starred Flynn, Rathbone and Melville Cooper. They all were in the Robin Hood film that same year.</fullReview>
