		<shortDescription>A really good movie about a man who was just crazy about women.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is just wonderful, a kind of masterpiece as for its construction, its dialogues and the actors' performances. The first image sets the scene very clearly : Bertrand Morane's burial attended only by women. No guys in the funeral procession. Twenty or so lovely middle-aged females are following their (former) lover's last trip. One of them, Brigitte Fossey, Bertrand's last girlfriend, comments, from backstage, on this unusual situation and explains, incidentally, what the film 's gonna be : a flashback to Bertrand's life. How does she happen to know about it ? Thanks to Bertrand's book she has recently edited for him and called "The man who loved women" (passed tense works here as a premonition). The author describes his passion for women and focuses on some of them. Inspired directly from the Bertrand's life (and from the director's life as well), his narrative is informal, genuine, sometimes contradictory but never pedantic nor rude. He remembers his love affairs, his bad and good times, and, most of all, tries to express his feelings to such an extent that is story must be seen as an auto-analysis, the writer's personal attempt to understand his personality rather than a woman chaser's curriculum vitae. Come to that, Charles Denner, the lead, shows us very well that his character's everything short of a sexist and self-confident womanizer. He fell in love once, but this experience turned out to be a real disappointment. Now, he feels as if he were unable to love anymore. So, he's `collecting'. He may have shortcomings, he may have fun picking up beautiful girls wherever and whenever he can, he may not be the kind of faithful and steady guy a good many girls usually like, his behavior might be considered as outrageous by some, the thing is he's a sensitive, affectionate, simple and nice person who knows how to make women happy and comfortable. Each mistress's chosen for a particular reason, a physical standard (behavior, way of walking, voice..) but all share one thing : they have long, smooth and attractive legs. All in all, `The man who loved women' is a mighty good film, worth watching it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>François Truffaut does it again</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another terrific character driven movie, François Truffaut creates a story that makes you laugh as well as cry. Charles Denner stars as a fan of the ladies. More than that, he is in great need of woman so much that is ends up to be his doom. The movie begins at the end, with the funeral. Like Hitchcock, François Truffaut makes a cameo at the beginning as his trademark. From there, we begin to see who this man was and why is urge for women caused his death. A very sexy film for 1977, it is still as funny today than it was almost 30 years ago. Unlike American movies, it is very difficult to have a scene with just words and no action. Many scenes in the movie are one shot scenes with nothing but pages of words, words and more words. This is the movie's strong point, besides having several beautiful women. The language (not just French) in the movie is powerful to its audience. It speaks to both men and women.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>François Truffaut--The Man Who Loved Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>During the same year that Close Encounters of The Third Kind came out, in which he played a part in, François Truffaut released The Man Who Loved Women. The title could easily apply to Truffaut himself. Truffaut loved women and in all of his films he explores the theme of love and all the conflicts that can assail when we are in such a state.In the Man Who Loved Women, Bertrand Morane is the man who loves women and early on in the film Truffaut makes his Hitchcock like cameo. But the character could easily have been played by Truffaut. The film begins with a woman telling us of Bertrand and the many women who loved him. Women who attend his funeral. In fact women who loved him are the only ones at his funeral. Once Bertrand pops up as a living character he narrates his own tale and tells us how he came to write a book entitled "The Man Who Loved Women." It was to resolve all the conflicting emotions he feels for all his loves that he started the book. The "book" is really the film. Bertrand is a man, and yes I may be redundant here, who loves women to the point of obsession. He sees a pair of legs pass him and he follows the legs to a car which he only gets a license plate for. He goes about contacting the driver of the car. In the process he meets another woman and so on and so on. Each woman a tale in his book, each woman he takes very seriously. Every single woman effecting him deeply. Bertrand has many loves but he is not the type of "Romeo" who uses his loves then throws them to the street. It is usually a case of things not working out that leads to a split in his relationships. The women are too strange, such as the case of the women who can only make love in public places or under circumstances of "danger." Or perhaps they feel he does not love them. Or they feel they can not love him in the way he seeks them to.Bertrand is seldom alone, prompting him to say at one point, while typing his memoir alone in his apartment, "I cherish my moments of isolation." For two hours we follow Bertrand's adventures as he genuinely falls for almost every woman he meets and some that he doesn't, such as the operator who calls him every morning at seven to wake him up. Bertrand is a homely man yet one imbuing a charm and sensitivity that as one woman says, "Feels like it is very important when you ask for something. Like you will almost die if you don't get it." He is hard to resist and so is the funny, charming, deep, introspective, dramatic, sometimes melodramatic, part autobiographical film from Francois Truffaut. I give it a 8 out of 10. It's not as cinematic as some of his earlier films but it certainly is better than the current trends of either domestic or foreign films. Truffaut passed away too soon and it is the cinema's loss in every way.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a very good movie--particularly the ending</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If this movie had JUST been about the sexual escapades of the main character, I would have hated it. After all, this is a man whose entire existence is based on bedding women--and this alone would have made a boring movie. Instead, it shows the emotional shallowness of this character and his complete inability to be close to another person--and its ultimate impact on him. He doesn't see this as a problem, but during the latter part of the movie, its impact on him becomes apparent. I particularly liked the unexpected ending. As the movie begins, it is at his funeral, so you KNOW he will die but HOW is the real interesting twist.About the only thing I did not like about the movie was the episodic nature. Sometimes it was a little hard to keep track of all the women. Perhaps this was unintentional, as there were a LOT of women in this man's life! Of course, it did serve to illustrate his problem!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>From it's title to it's ending a great movie by Francois Truffaut</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From it's title to it's ending The Man Who loved women is a great movie. Francois Truffaut displays all his mastery of the cinematographic language. The editing, performances and dialogues all contribute to the film's subtle but engaging rhythm. The movie revolves around Bertrand Morane, a gifted womanizer who starts evaluating his life by remembering past love affairs. Bertrand's love life is a comical and insightful story, that combined with Truffaut's brilliant direction and a perfect script make "L'homme qui aimait les femmes" a very entertaining and original movie. Beautiful french women, great cinematography and Charles Denner's acting. There are no mistakes in this film, very recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Memoirs of a Womanizer</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In 1976, in Montpellier, the funeral of the engineer Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner) is attended by several women. The lonely Bertrand works in a laboratory in a ship model basin and wind tunnel for aircraft testing and loves books and women, spending his leisure time seducing women and reading. Along his life, Bertrand makes love to the most different type of women and decides to write a book telling his love affairs."L'Homme qui Aimait les Femmes" discloses the memoirs of a womanizer. This sensual and funny film is a great tribute to the beautiful French women with lovely French actresses. The romances of Bertrand are provoking and charming and his character shows that a man does not need to be handsome to be seductive and conquer women. Last but not the least, Bertrand is a man that follows the poetry of the French Henri de Régnier (1864-1936): "Love is eternal while it lasts". My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): "O Homem Que Amava as Mulheres" ("The Man Who Loved the Women")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A brilliant movie, about the thoughts of a man that loved women.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first time I saw this movie, I hated it. The narrative structure wasn't what I was used to, and the movie as a whole seemed distorted and I wasn't sure what it is going too.Three years later, haven deepened my culture with books such as "L'amant" de M. Duras, movies such as "Emmanuelle". I started really to appreciate this movie. It is about reality, a man who isn't afraid to scribble down all his memoirs and thoughts. Of cause, at first it seemed very self contradictory, but life is full of contradictions. It is hard to find someone nowadays to have the courage to share all his feelings and thoughts despite all the social values we have been raised with.A brilliant, brilliant movie, only if you could understand the whole of it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Far superior than the shoddy and self promoting Burt Reynolds remake. Excellent performances and a classic. Anyone interested in NLP and Speed Seduction should watch this as it is a great reference resource of "Unconscious Competence". The guy knows what he is doing...but doesn't know how he does it. Shame the ending is given away at the start but that only compounds the deep impact the guy had on all of the women. The fact that he is over fifty gives hope for us all. I have no issue with the amount of women involved. If it was the other way around, in these so called 'enlightened' times, when women have so much focus, she would have been applauded as a woman who takes control! Pour a glass of red wine and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's love for women in film form</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The first half of The Man Who Loved Women is absolutely wonderful it is picture perfect. The second half, especially a large chunk about Bertrand's (Charles Denner) love affair with a somewhat unstable married women drags a little bit. This dose not mean that it is a boring film, on the contrary, it is a joy to sit through. Bertrand loves women (as the title hints at), he loves women so much he cant stop himself from going too great lengths to talk too a beautiful women. He will do anything necessary, he dose not care about the way he is perceived or if he will be rejected, he goes completely on instinct without thinking about any outcome or what might happen, he just must talk to any women that peaks his interest. Bertrand is not Don Juan he just has a natural, and somewhat unstoppable way of falling in love with every woman he sees, or in the case of his wake up telephone service, hear. Women are intrigued or attracted to his non-threatening natural nature. In fact at one point one women says that she could never refuse him of anything because of the "way he asks for it". Truffaut creates a complete dream world were every women it beautiful, every women has a perfect figure, every women walk and moves like a ballet dancer. Truffaut obviously loves women he loves everything about them, everything! He creates this world that all men would love to be a part of. Truffaut (and his writing partners) do a wonderful job of creating a character that we can love while at the same time be fascinated by his whimsical attitude to life. He has no friends, he dose not associate with any men outside of a work environment. He has one interest, one hobby, one passion, that being women. Charles Denner plays this role perfectly, he has the sort of absent minded professor quality, Bertrand has one thing on his mind only and its written all over his face. Though there are uneven moments and some situations feel contrived, this is a beautiful, funny, touching and at times though provoking film. Enthusiastically Recommended !!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A movie made for men who love women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is another great movie by the late François Truffaut. With this, the legendary filmmaker attempted an original idea for a movie: a movie about a man who loves women. Has its flaws, but the overall result is nice and successful.Every man who loves women should watch this and enjoy it. I love women myself. You don't have to be like the lead character (Bertrand Morane) to love women. No matter the way you love women, this is a movie for all the men who worship women, both for men who are lucky with women and for men who are unsuccessful with women.The great actor Charles Denner portrays a very interesting character: Bertrand Morane, the one whom the movie's title is all about. He appears to be between 45/50 years old, works in a laboratory testing the aerodynamics of aircraft, owns an Alfa Romeo Giulia saloon and... loves women. He never resists a lovely pair of legs and yet he seems more interested in watching attractive women than actually having something serious with them. He even goes to extraordinary lengths to locate and lure women he'd seen, even if for nothing...His peculiar kind of attraction for women turns out to be fatal for him at the end. He goes after two women with nice legs at the wrong place at the wrong time and gets hit by a car. Once in the hospital, he accidentally severs his drip, falls out of his bed and dies ? and all because he feels attracted by the nurses's legs.His burial is the most original ever: you see nothing but women and they all show their attractive legs. After all, it's a special funeral. The funeral of a special man.The final credits are also among the most original and best ever, thanks to all those shots of lovely legs that drive us women lovers crazy.Considering the fact that this is a movie about a man who loves women, not all the women are attractive, but there are a few who are. Brigitte Fossey is undoubtedly one of the most attractive women in this movie. She was a really adorable child and grew up to be quite an attractive young woman.Title in Portugal: 'O homem que gostava das mulheres'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a Film as Much as A Seductive Cinematic Pleasure</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the eight feature film by Francois Truffaut that I have seen. He made 25 feature films over a 24 year period from 1959 to 1983.What I find most interesting about Truffaut's development is how conventional he became. With "Jules and Jim," (1960) he broke every rule of cinema convention. Here, 17 years later, he does a movie that is a model of Hollywood conventionally. It is so conventional that Hollywood soon copies it into an American version starring Burt Reynolds, (a film which also has its merits.) In conventional cinema the audience is meant to identify with a character subjectively. The ability to cut shots so the viewer becomes part of the action, seeing what a character sees and feeling what a character feels, is the essence of conventional Hollywood cinema. Here we are meant to identify solely with "the skirt-chasing" hero. Yet the hero seems to be only a stand-in for Truffaut himself, or at least a vision of Truffaut that he would like the audience to have of him. Because Trauffaut is a master of cinema as his hero Hitchcock was a master of cinema, we, the audience, do identify with the hero.It is only at the moments when we are looking at the course, rough facial features of Charles Denner, when we see him as being 6 years older than Truffaut and not nearly as handsome that we find it hard to accept him as a man with the power to sweep women off their feet. If Truffaut is the lover Bertrand Morane, Danner is not. However, it is only at moments when we cast ourselves into the roles of the quite beautiful women in the film that this becomes a problem. It is curious that Jean-Pierre Léaud did not play the lead in this film as he personified Truffaut in so many other films.In any case, even if Danner is not so handsome, we feel the pleasure of the successful seducer. It is a pleasure that even death cannot wipe out. However, because of the conventionality of the film, we do not feel the joy of the new wave.One day, someone will make a movie about two brothers, one named Francois and the other Jean Luc. The first brother created conventional works of art that were masterpieces of subjective narrative, the other brother took a Brechtian delight in exploding those conventions and making sure that we never identified with a character, but only studied them. I am think, amazingly, although their paths diverged considerably, they may have arrived at the same peak of cinematic art.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Truffaut's masterful homage to true love, its joys and its pains</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut made so many superb films (and some minor and more forgettable too), but this one succeeds at so many levels that I felt compelled to give it a perfect score. Which I did, and here's why. ****Possible spoilers may below!**** First, Charles Denner, although not your average Casanova as far as looks are considered, displays such a calm intensity, such an obvious sincerity and such a determination in finding that something he is so desperately missing, and which we ultimately get to understand when he meets Véra (Leslie Caron): true love. We do not fall in love - that is total love, love with total and innocent abandon - more than once or twice during our lifetime. It's too painful to survive to a rupture from the loved one, which is why it's such a unique experience and why we don't want to ever go to another cycle of love/rupture of that magnitude. Too risky for one's very survival. And yet, because it's really a single, one-of-a-kind experience that takes the lovers to heaven, because its pleasures are so plentiful and so ecstatic, we think we can find a substitute in another person. As Truffaut's narration goes in fact: since we already found exactly what fulfilled completely our own "heart" (that poorly understood and complex neural center that we still thus call) when we met the object of our true love. There's nothing rational of course in such matters, and nobody else can possibly reunite that purely idiosyncratic combination of body and mind that we met somewhat randomly and that happened to be there when we were ready for ... falling in love. Truffaut had an exquisite understanding of matters of the heart as abundantly demonstrated by his filmography (from the Antoine Doinel pentalogy to "L'histoire d'Ad?le H", without forgetting "Jules et Jim" and "Les deux Anglaises et le Continent". But Charles Denner's character is obviously a much closer alter ego than Jean-Pierre Léaud's (alias Doinel), the latter being rather a charming caricature of Truffaut's own shortcomings. It is now common knowledge that "L'homme qui aimait les femmes" is the most autobiographical film from Truffaut. It was probably quite an intense but transcendental experience for him to write a story so close to his own life story, and such an intimate portrayal may explain why this movie resonates so strongly and so poignantly for the viewer. Well, it did for me at least. Not that I recognized myself in this "tombeur" or "cavaleur" ? those are the words that he sometimes uses to describe himself ? who is neither a Casanova nor a Don Juan. But mostly because just like Bertrand Morane/Denner/Truffaut, I realize that I tried very hard to find another xxxxx after my affair with her ended but could never really succeed as well as with xxxxx, although I did have many excellent encounters and affairs that enriched my life. Not that the women who followed did not have their unique qualities and attributes: it's just that.... the quest for a replacement for true love is so well depicted in that masterpiece that words will always to convey what is ultimately extremely personal and unique.The movie would already be successful and superb if it was merely a richly illustrated, somewhat archetypal portrait of a man who has an urge to meet women he meets aimlessly for reasons he cannot specifically formulate but that can be as trivial as the particular effect that the fringe of a dress will have on the silhouette of a woman's legs. But it turns out to be more, much more than simply that. As we gradually find out, Bertrand decides to write about his life experience with women, an exercise that he thinks (more or less consciously, as we realize ultimately) might help him to understand his urge of his and perhaps exorcize himself At some point, he says (as an off voice) something like : "Is it pathological? Am I a poor fellow with a base obsession who just wants to pin down as many women as he can like so many bugs he captures with his intricate stratagems?". An encounter that did not turn out well is the trigger and makes him realize that in fact, he does not understand why he acts in such a way with so many women. As the movie unfolds, the book progresses, but Bertrand meets a few disappointments and even consider abandoning the book when he finally finds an editor who is willing to publish the book. The favorable decision results from the efforts of a woman on the reading committee (luminous Brigitte Fossey) for this publishing house, who enthusiastically advocates his manuscript. When the movie concludes, Truffaut leaves us on this note: "There's a way that all our pleasures and sufferings in the name of love or else will not have been in vain, And we call this..... a book." Although Truffaut did not write fiction in the form of novels (his written oeuvre consists in a few successful essays and a very substantial correspondence), he was an avid reader and a great admirer of literature. How often have we seen films praising what has been ultimately the major source of inspiration of the greatest movies in history, i.e. the written book? "L'Homme qui aimait les femmes" is an homage to women, to the unique nature of true love and its quest, and to writing as a meaningful vehicle for transcending what would absurdly die with ourselves, as another tool in human quest for eternity of the individual. A masterpiece and to me, the most completely satisfactory movie in Truffaut's filmography.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dull, rigid, lifeless, a script born dead</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The camera is very precise. I might say even more precise than the regular Truffaut work. The script is also well manicured. Every piece is well finished. And I had quite some fun watching the French DVD subtitles who change a word here and there just to reinforce what a misplaced word might have done. And that's about it. A nice rehearsed funeral. Nothing more. Charles Denner is a dead Leaud. The uglier unpolished brother Leaud never had. The lines are as artificial in his mouth as they are in the mouths of the other unremarkable actors passing by. Because the whole thing is forced. And the force lacks grace. There is nothing natural in this work, the same way a decomposed body looks unlike the live equivalent. The pace of the story is slow. The pace of the hearse carrying the dead body. Actually this is where all starts. A funeral. Every scene is carefully customized. One car has license plates of Paris. The rest of the parking has Herault plates. Than there are some more Parisians. And boom! The Southern Belle walks like a Parisian with complexes and talks like one. The man travels. But he's always in Paris. Surrealism? A bit beyond what the skinny Catholic boy can jump. A disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Trap of Sexual Obsession</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Each film by François Truffaut is like an antithesis for its predecessor (Shoot the Piano Player for The 400 Blows, Jules et Jim for Shoot the Piano Player etc.) but The Man Who Loved Women (1977) isn't really the opposite of Small Change (1976) but more like The Story of Adele H. (1975) turned upside down. First of all, the protagonist of The Story of Adele H. is a woman and the protagonist of The Man Who Loved Women is a man. However, despite the tragical intensity of The Story of Adele H. and the light comedy of The Man Who Loved Women both films deal with sexual obsessions. In the former film, the woman is madly in love with a man from whom she can't get response. In turn, the latter is all about a man who doesn't believe in true love and therefore goes from one brief relationship to another.The Man Who Loved Women (1977) might just be Truffaut's funniest comedy but, what is more, it also presents an insightful picture of an obsessive womanizer Bertrand, brilliantly played by Charles Denner. Just like The Story of Adele H., it is also a story about an independent character who is a victim of his own obsession. In addition, in the background of both stories there is an abandonment (made by a mother or a lover), both protagonists try to imitate their parents in one way or another and are inevitably going to face destruction, both stories are also recorded to personal memoirs and both of them have separate prologue and epilogue sequences.Already in the very beginning of The Man Who Loved Women we are told that the protagonist has died and at the cemetery we enter a long flashback which equals most of the film. However, before we enter this flashback we see women walking to the cemetery but also Truffaut himself passing by, which is a clear statement that the film knows that it is fiction. As if he was sealing the deal. It is consciously exaggerated romanticism, so to speak. This idea is also highlighted by the fact that the protagonist starts to change his memories when he decides to write an autobiographical novel. His whole life is fiction.Usually, Truffaut portraits fatal women who lead their lovers to death and destruction (Jules and Jim, The Bride Wore Black) but in this case the man is the dangerous character who lures women. However, in reality he is much more destructive for himself than for the women he loves. His obsession seems to be some sort of a defense mechanism against the vulnerability which hunts many of Truffaut's characters who are often abandoned by a cold mother (The 400 Blows).As said, Bertrand is a victim of his own obsession and just like the dogmatism of Catherine, from Jules et Jim, so is the obsession of Bertrand an absolute prelude for death. He is constantly tied to his own madness. He loves to watch women and even points out that "women's legs are like compass points, circling the globe." Although, this rather plain concept gets an intriguing twist because Bertrand actually sees the seductive legs of women everywhere -- even where there aren't any; like in the outrageous scene at the airport -- and they also seal his destiny.Besides youth and innocence, love was a repeating theme throughout Truffaut's career and that is why he is often called the romantic of the French New Wave. In his world, love was a dominant force which restricted the lives of people. But it also appears to us as kind and patient. The Man Who Loved Women was Truffaut's tribute, not only to women, but to love. In the director's personal love life, he had several lovers but no life partners. Although, Truffaut wasn't a womanizer by any means he said that he never stopped loving his former lovers. As if relationships were transient but love was eternal.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>narrative details</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is one of the most interesting conceptions of a man who spent all his career and life questioning the very conception of cinema and what it meant in every moment. After the adventure of french new wave of the 60's, Truffaut matured and, to me, he started producing his more focused work. He basically produced some films which were essays on cinema, as well as autobiographical depictions of his thoughts.So, we have a film about storytelling. A womanizer who writes the story of his life. Every woman in his life is, herself, a story. So the pleasure of being involved with a woman maps the will Truffaut has to tell a story. The fact that Morane writes all the stories, and makes one single big form (a book) with them enhances this.The woman editor has an important role. She is the key character that Truffaut places above Morane, and she annotates and comments on the whole structure. Her remarks on Morane's book and personality may as well be taken as commentaries on the very film, and of its director. She is self-reference, she is Truffaut commenting on himself, thus adding reflexivity to the film. That's why she observes that Morane, the writer, doesn't reject the "details" others wouldn't notice, and she literally says that he is basically a storyteller. Also, she is the one who remarks the fact that Morane's funeral is the perfect ending to the story. I saw all this as reflexive annotations on the very structure of the film and, more generally, on the nature of Truffaut's cinema. He was through all his life a storyteller, and above any pleasure he took in making a film, there was the pleasure of narrating. Also he took a special interest in filming details, something i think he took from Hitchcock. The hand dialing phone numbers, or turning the pages in the address book, that sort of thing.Morane's funeral, which opens and closes the film, gathers all the women around him. It is, like the editor (the second narrator) told, a praising of Morane's life, the recognizing of his qualities, the celebration of his life (cinema).This and "La nuit américaine" are so far the best built films by Truffaut that i saw. Many times i think that Truffaut (and Godard!) has spent to much time around things which were not that important, like school kids discussing football teams. But in certain points, he made important contributions to the evolving of cinematic narrative. This is one of them.My opinion: 4/5 http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Man Who Seeked More Than Sex, Passion and Romance</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Truffaut's 'L'Homme Qui Aimait Les Femmes' is an intriguing character driven piece. It tells the story of a bachelor who hops from one woman's bed to another. Alongside physical satisfaction he also seeks intimacy, passion and romance but at the same time that isn't enough and he finds himself craving for something more. Truffaut hints child abuse through Bertrand's dysfunctional relationship with his mother (who was a prostitute). Bertrand decides to write down his various encounters in a book and that seems to provide some answers as he searches for perspective. The movie opens with a funeral sequence attended by numerous women and we learn very soon who's funeral it is.It's a charming film. The pace slackens a little in the middle but the amusing lines keep the viewer entertained throughout. The subtle dark humour works superbly. Denner acts quite well even though I felt that he was, physically, miscast. The rest of the cast, that mostly includes beautiful women, are just as good (and certainly pleasing to look at).Truffaut's storytelling is compelling. He gives 'L'Homme Qui Aimait Les Femmes' a poetic touch. There is a certain whimsical quality to it that combines successfully with the subtle elements. The first rate cinematography and score contribute to the viewing pleasure. This is quite a good example of charming French cinema minus the typically French clichés.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This isn't love</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released just three years before the onset of AIDS, this picture captures one aspect of the interrelation between men and women in the '70's. Venerial diseases had been checked, reliable contraception measures were readily available, and the aforementioned plague had not yet been visited upon us. Sex was easy to get, but a sustained relationship much less so. This sort of hit-and-run collecting of sexual scalps was practiced by women nearly as often as by men. Either way, one dared feel emotional connection only at great risk. Being on the losing end of these transactions didn't feel good, and it's hard to muster sympathy for the protagonist, who perishes much as the road kill one sees every spring, when mating season causes hormones to trump common sense.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A late Truffaut misfire</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As an admirer of French cinema I came to this with high hopes. Sadly, they were not justified. This is a miserable experience concerned only with a dismal 41-year old man who seems incapable of loving but only of lusting. And the women seem equally bland and lacking in charm and affection once you cut past their external beauty. It's difficult to admire a film when virtually none of the characters justifies sympathy. In fact the only person in the film who I felt any sympathy with was the typist who undertook writing up the book; at least she got out before the end.The structure doesn't help. I can deal with a flashback approach (the film starts with our "hero's" funeral), but then we get flashbacks within flashbacks, including some rather contrived pieces of early childhood and mother-son relationship. This led to some confusion about chronology although, to be honest, by that time I had lost the sort of interest that I always had for his earlier work.Maybe Truffaut, who was himself rather fond of women, felt there was some autobiographical element in the story; or maybe he was trying to justify his earlier experiences with women. Either way it was a disappointment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved??</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Another good film by Truffaut (as with DW Griffith, Leni Riefenstahl) in the sense of a good watch, but why does it seem so gloomy and weighted down--at times even like a horror film. Is it because Bertrand Morane is a solitary? Or because he draws us into a world (through his low key, partly sympathetic rendering) that is somehow upsetting and/or even detestable? Is it because the view here is hothouse psychological? A kind of Freudian mind drama in which a mother-son dyad subsumes everything outside itself to its own ends? (see "Alfie" for a social view of a similar womanizer) Is it because of the extent to which this fantasy is carried out---that it finally seems deranged, and sick, as if the product of a puerile mind in an adult? Or is it all the concealment techniques used to paint Bertrand as so exceptional a male that he might even find acceptance on an all-female island?I think all of the above count but for my part the real source of gloom is the absence of women in "The Man Who Loved Women." No matter the angle, the multiplicity of women (one arguable exception) are singularly available to Bertrand Morane. They are inspected (their entry into his world and our screens), pursued, consumed, and disposed of--all to their immense delight. This is their invisibility Oh yeah, they have their fleeting stories, but these are invariably subsumed by Bertrand's script, which is all about pleasure, appetite, and some trumped up memory of a delinquent promiscuous mother. But the big lie in all this and what Bertrand is most convinced of is that women want and need sex--and specifically from him. This availability is so patently confirmed as to be pornographic. Each step of his lovers' butterfly-like life span with him is not only accepted, but savored and yearned for. It's as if his sexualizing puppy-love has incapacitated them, cutting them off from both their own minds, and their own worlds. No way they're drawn to him for social reasons (this is not "Alfie")---but an irressistable urge which speaks for the social power (cleverly hidden by Truffaut) behind his very personal power trip. And accounts for Bertrand's capacity to transform live, often tall, world-aware women into fun sex toys.The real convincer in this schema of availability, though, is Genevieve, the editor publisher. You expect her to be the point woman for exposure, given her position and her inside view of Bertrand's story, but no--she is the ultimate patsy. She not only loves his refreshingly honest take on his use of women---which she convinces herself is so modern, and contains a tendency toward equality, but converts five resistant male co-publishers to her view. Which makes it just a matter of time--she's lucky to be leggy-- before she expresses wimpish longings for the said Bertrand Morane and jumps into bed with him. And her love, like that of all his others, will soon become eternal and confer a kind of sainthood on the late Bertrand. If this seems astonishing than her role in the burial scene confirms it to be nakedly true. Surrounded by dozens of Saint Bertrand's lovers, she supplies the voice over as each woman approaches to toss dirt on his coffin. She touts each as an example of Bertrand's diverse taste for women... like shy, myopic, gentle, passionate, orphanish, funny, and so forth, ad nauseam as if even greater holiness might be bestowed on a male who has slept with Asians, Blacks, Latinas, Russians, and Native Islanders. Anyway, a "fitting" end indeed to a man who classified all women as either "kittens" or "fillies."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Mah who loved Women</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"The Man Who Loved Women" by Francois Truffaut is the critically acclaimed film released in Europe in 1977 that is a comedy/adult drama that teaches quite an interesting lesson about men and women. Specifically the obsession of sex and carnal pleasure without the input of love, respect and commitment.Bertrand Morane (Charles Denner), is a man who loves every woman he meets, literally. You can basically call him a leech, and sex addict, because he has never loved any women he has slept with. However in some cases the man tries to develop a relationship with these woman and it's the women and not him that are problem. One woman comes to mind. Delphine,is a paranoid sex slut who likes to have sex in dangerous places for the thrills of it. She reminds of the type of woman I briefly have met and or even the schizophrenic "kitty", bondage like women who have rated my reviews (You know who you are). Later on we learn that she does it to spite her husband. Morane at first thinks Delphine likes him, but being a grown man and being smart enough to realize when he is being played for the fool, he soon realizes she is just using him. She is just a piece of trash that he had the pleasure and displeasure to be with. In a way this incident describes the problems for Morane, sometimes he meets really nice women who are afraid of commitment but like the sex (does feeding Morane's appetite for more sex without love), and other times he meets these nasty, gutter trash, unfeeling, abusive and self paranoid women wholl screw him in the end. Quite a sad story, and it gets sadder and at times funnier throughout. The flight attendant encounter he has is a pretty memorable fling, one those flings where Morane and his mate have fun, and both come away happy with their short term encounter.However, the party is over when Morane through his doctor, Doctor Bicard (Jean Daste) tells him he has Gonorhea. In a funny scene, the Doctor tells him to tell his sexual partner that she has it, but Morane cannot do that, because he has been with a dozen women over the last few years and taking names was something Morane didn't do. LOL It's this sort of negligence and irresponsiblity that show the side of Morane that every womanizer is. A man in pursuit in his own selfish interest that when the time comes out to help another, the man (whether a womanizer or a capitalistic) doesn't care. In this case, Morane's Gonorrhea infection is both ironic and fitting.Morane through this predicament then tells the Dr. about the book that he is writing and the Dr. encourages him to write since it would help him perhaps deal with his women issues and perhaps find the sexual partner with whom he infected gonorreah with.Despite the somewhat offensive premise, "The Man Who Loved Women" or better known by it's original title "Homme qui aimait les femmes, L'" is a very entertaining French adult comedy/drama almost reminiscent of newer comedies like "Amelie".The film by Francois Truffaut is regarded as one of his best from a very respectable director. He has done quite a good job here including themes that teaches the audiences many lessons. Ask for the DVD released by MGM, it was a dissappointment, no commentary, no trailer, no nothing basically the film itself. However the fact that the movie is available in U.S. is good news since many of these rare films from the 1970's are practically unavaible in the video store.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Much better than some of Truffaut's other, overrated stuff.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Unlike Truffaut's other movies, this one doesn't have dull bits, and the bits that are supposed to be funny sometimes are. A French comedy with some funny/amusing moments?? Is that possible? Apparently, yes. Once in a blue moon, of course. Apparently there was a blue moon in 1977. It's about a guy who has affairs with countless women, is literally obsessed by them, eventually deciding to write a book about his sexual exploits. At first glance, it's hard to accept the little hook-nosed Morane as being some sort of Casanova. However, you get used to that quickly, partly because a lot of the women he gets aren't that great-looking, either. (Although, I'm sure this was neither Truffaut's point nor intention.) The movie is quite pleasant to watch, the dialog and the narration are interesting. The only drawback, and it's not a major one, is that occasional situations and supporting actors aren't too convincing, but this is to be expected from a European movie (UK films not included).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Sleazy Truffaut Trifle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Don't believe all the fawning, obsequious other reviews praising this movie as one of Truffaut's best...It isn't.Here's the premise of the film: an ugly Frenchman with hangdog features lusts after every attractive woman he meets in his life (oh, and they all have to have great legs--that's his main obsession) and without the benefit of any particular charm or suaveness, manages to bed them all. I suppose because he happens to be bluntly honest, both to himself (as he narrates his story to the audience) and to the objects of his affection, THAT is supposed to be the secret to his amorous successes.Yep, this homely Pepe LePew of a Ladies Man is such a lady-killer that in order not to disturb the fantasy of this piece, when his physician informs him he's contracted gonorrhea and should make an attempt to contact all his most recent lovers, he dismisses the task because there's been too many and he can't remember any of their names. What a Romeo! How noble and conscientious! Too bad Truffaut didn't live long enough to remake this in the age of Aids...his main character could be a real prince then. Ladykiller, indeed.It's not without total believability that such a troll (notice I didn't use the term "Frog"--hey, I can be politically correct when I put my mind to it) could maybe score with a few model type babes at some point in his lifetime (since, after all, you do see foxes all the times with guys so ugly you have to do a double-take and ask yourself, "what the hell does she see in him?! But almost immediately the actual answer quickly pops into your head--oh, he must have money).I can see how some viewers might have fell for the charms of this frog of a picture (ok, I'm weak). It's a complete fantasy, and like all fantasies, there are those for whom the fantasy charms and captivates, and those who think the whole schlemiel is ridiculous and contrived. I was one of the latter.</fullReview>
