		<shortDescription>Gable &amp; Harlow without interference from the Production Code</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For those that have never seen a pre-Code film, RED DUST is a great film to begin with. It certainly isn't shy about dealing with adultery, prostitution, or heavy drinking. Although it was made over 70 years ago, it holds up extremely well by today's standards. This is due to a well written script that dealt with these subjects directly and wasn't restrained by the Production Code that was enacted 2 years later. Later films either didn't deal with this type of content or did so in a way that was ridiculous. It is also due to the performances of a rugged and virile Clark Gable and a strong willed and street smart Jean Harlow and a strong supporting cast. There is no doubt as to the sexual stamina of their two characters. We find this out early and often. One example is when Gable tucks money down Harlow's dress and says, "It's been nice having you." and spanks her behind. Most modern films would have shown a sex scene while films subject to the code would have treated its audience as children and made us aware in a ridiculous way that would satisfy the censors. The scene where he warns her against misusing the plumbing and attempts to pull her out of the water barrel(yes, she's naked, but we don't see the nudity) while the society woman he is trying to seduce watches on is hilarious. Clark Gable and Jean Harlow made one the better on screen couples of that time. It is a shame that her career was tragically cut short. I also enjoyed the scene where a frightened Mary Astor slaps him across the face for his indifference to the plight of her sick husband and he responds with a smug and confident grin. The movie also gives one an appreciation of the primitive conditions people lived in on a rubber plantation during that time. RED DUST is directed by Victor Fleming who would later direct THE WIZARD OF OZ and Clark Gable in GONE WITH THE WIND. People have complained that this film is racist, but need to realize that the world was a much different place in 1932 than in 2003. If you can do that, you'll probably enjoy this film. 9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gable &amp; Harlow Get Torrid In The Tropics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The fetid RED DUST of a Malaysian rubber plantation is the setting for an adulterous triangle involving the quick-tempered, rawboned manager, a brassy American prostitute &amp; the upper-class wife of a new employee. Together, they're about to heat up the tropics.Although blessed with good acting &amp; fine production values, this is merely a soap opera set in the jungle. MGM was pushing the moral envelope here, seeing just how far they could go with libidinous behavior - and in those pre-Production Code days that was pretty far. Clark Gable &amp; Jean Harlow exude sexuality, openly lusting for each other &amp; spreading hormones around the screen. Harlow's lines (of dialogue) are both witty &amp; suggestive, while Gable talks with his eyes and his hands. They were a perfect cinematic match and this film was such a big success that they would repeat the same basic plot 3 years later in CHINA SEAS, although the Code would cause that film to be a bit more covert.Mary Astor adds a wrinkle to the plot as another fine-looking female for Gable to mate with, but the audience is never in any doubt that gorgeous Harlow will get him in the end. The rest of the cast (Gene Raymond, Donald Crisp, Tully Marshall &amp; giggling Willie Fung) are good in small roles.It should be noted that the story line contains racist elements, not unusual in a Hollywood film of that era.By the way, the bedtime story Harlow is reading Gable at the end of the movie is a parody - and a good one - of the animal stories by Thornton W. Burgess which were very popular at the time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of My Favorite Pre-Code Films</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>To me this is one of the films that defined the Pre-Code Era. Complete with prostitution, adultery, sex as a major plot point, partial nudity (well, much more than was allowed during the Code enforcement), drunkenness, and strong women characters, this film has it all. Plus, it has an extremely engaging storyline, interesting setting, and an explanation of how rubber is made. Aside from the racism present, this film is great. One of the most interesting things about this film, which I have studied a great deal as a part of my senior thesis in undergrad film school, is the freshness of the dialogue. Coming only a few years after the addition of sound to films I was shocked to find how fun and refreshing the dialogue was. Whereas lots of films these days disappoint me in that the dialogue is so overly cliched and stale, Red Dust has lines about favorite cheeses and stories read about bunnies-- how fun!All and all, this movie is terrific. Clark is as virile as anything and Jean Harlow is full of strength and sass and dimensions-- just a great female character. And hell if she isn't going to fight for her man! Mary Astor's character is also very well done as we see and believe that Clark is just so tempted by her and she by him. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone-- It's a 120 times better than its remake, Mogambo, which despite Gable's presence just totally loses everything that Red Dust had.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pre-code period piece melodrama with intelligent writing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Context is an important element in viewing any work of art or commerce and movies are both. "Red Dust" at it's core is about human weakness and strength, in degree and in full force. Mary Astor, a star since appearing opposite John Barrymore in "Don Juan", plays a repressed wife who doesn't believe in the strength of her husband (Gene Raymond) nor her own weakness when it comes to resisting the animal magnetism of rubber plantation owner Dennis (Clark Gable). Conversely, Gable doesn't realize his weakness in letting himself get involved with the ladylike Astor and underestimates the strength of prostitute Vantine (Jean Harlow) who, when Astor shoots Gable, gives witness to Raymond that his wife is innocent and that Gable deserved shooting. For it's time, 1932, "Red Dust" is sexually progressive, showing the freely running passions of Gable and the two women, while in retrospect, it's depiction of Asians is as poor stereotypes. Willie Fung, who plays Gable's houseboy, is also derided as gay in the script by the line delivered by Jean Harlow. Harlow notices Fung giggling at her underwear, to which she replies "Gee...you even find them in the jungle.""Red Dust" has a tremendous "back story" as well. John Gilbert was to play the part of Dennis originally as an attempt to bolster his masculine image which had been damaged by the higher-than-anticipated timbre of his voice as recorded by early sound equipment. With the sensation caused by Gable when he returned Norma Shearer's slap in the face in "A Free Soul" Gable's star rose mercurily. No "hero" ever countered the indignation of the leading lady before, and certainly not the divas at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. Gable was a whole new breed of leading man. Jean Harlow's star had been on the ascendant after scoring a huge hit in "Red Headed Woman" a scandalous story of a secretary who sleeps her way to the top. The realism of these two performers in those films made them a natural for the raw jungle tale of passion and betrayal. In the middle of the making of the film, Jean Harlow's producer-husband, Paul Bern, was found dead. The scandal that followed frightened the studio who thought that Harlow's career was over. Scandal had ruined the careers of Fatty Arbuckle and Clara Bow, causing their studio (Paramount) to loose millions on their films. M.G.M. was surprised when Harlow's fame and popularity increased. For her part, Harlow returned to the studio and never spoke an unkind word about her late husband. Bern, it turned out, had a common law wife who had emerged from years-long institutionalization and confronted him about his new wife.Racism is not a key element in the plot of "Red Dust". For that, you would have to see "The Mask of Fu Manchu" where the Asians are neither lazy nor stupid, but sexual predators, instead. Or you could watch any number of other World War Two American movies with Asians in them. But for accurate Pre-censorship Hollywood adult dialogue and plot, "Red Dust" will do nicely, thank you.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harlow/Gable chemistry is unmatched in cinema</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dust is definitive proof that Gable and Harlow were a unique phenomena in the field of cinema chemistry. It is also stands as a prime example as to why Harlow became a star so quick. She is a loveable sex goddess, and there has simply been no other like her. The way she stares at and chides Gable, and the sheer image of delight which graces her expressive face when she's in his presence, is something that couldn't be taught in any acting college. It is pure Harlow. The production value is quite adequate for 1932, with Harlow playing a prostitute on the run who happens upon Gables rubber plantation. The arrival of Mary Astor and her husband played well by Gene Raymond, threatens Harlow's chances with Gable, as he takes a liking to the pleasant demeanor of Astor. The rain-barrel scene in which gable scolds Harlow for being to "care-free" is one of Hollywood's most memorable film moments. This film was remade as "Mogambo" by John Ford in 1953. The role of "Vantine" (occupied by Harlow) was assumed by Ava Gardner, and the Mary Astor role was assumed by Grace Kelly. Though more than competent in their roles, neither of these actresses could recapture the spark that made Harlow and Gable the "it" couple of the 1930's.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Trip to Cinema's Past with a Timeless Theme</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you can't stand old films that perpetuate and even celebrate racist notions, skip 1932's "Red Dust." Putting that historical reality in perspective, "Red Dust" is a very good, well-acted film set in a studio's fantasy of the Indo-China jungle and its rubber plantations.Where would film have gone in depicting real romantic relationships with steamy exchanges and barely hidden amorous capers if, two years after "Red Dust," the puritanical code that stifled sexuality hadn't been imposed? Who knows but here Clark Gable as Denny, a plantation manager, Jean Harlow as Lily, a woman who, as they used to say, was no better than she ought to be and lovely Mary Astor as Babs Willis act out an adult story.Babs is married to "gosh, oh, golly" idealist and almost straight man Gary Willis, played with affecting naivete by Gene Raymond. Gary works for Denny who is working Babs. Sent away into the deep black-and-white monsoon greenery of the jungle by Denny, Gene is thankful for what he thinks is a fine job opportunity. Also happy are Babs and Denny whose obvious affair is portrayed without any of the sweaty gymnastics that are the staple of today's films.Enter Lily who really loves Denny and knows she's the only true tramp for him. Gene is planning (in 1932!) for a house in Westchester County, NY (then a true rural backwater, not a suburban one) complete with kids. Denny doesn't know what he wants and Babs loves him but she hasn't forgotten she's hitched.Director Victor Fleming lets this story play out within, barely, the bounds of then acceptable storytelling."Red Dust" shows up on movie channels and is available for sale. It's an important piece of Hollywood's pre-war history and is still a viewer-grabbing flick.8/10.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dust without a doubt is the best movie Harlow and Gable ever made together or separate! Harlow is magnificent and looks like a dream. She puts Gable in his place every time he utters a word. But together, they are magic - such chemistry! The rest of the cast just fades when these two melt together. Two scenes that are memorable - Harlow bathing in the water barrel and cleaning out the parrot's cage. Wow! She is dynamite.

		<shortDescription>Highly charged</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Erotically highly charged melodrama that fairly sizzles, even today, more than 70 years later. Cinematography has a plasticity and a sheen to it that makes the film gorgeous to look at, editing is highly efficient and gets the job done and the story told, and the acting is fabulous. I wasn't prepared for the physical impact of the young Gable, how he makes absolutely no excuses for his raw sexuality and libido and how amazingly attractive he was. Harlow as well, I was prepared to find her vulgar and shallow, but she was quite good and certainly had a chemistry thing going with Gable.Recommended, and please, all of you insisting that this is an inexcusably racist picture, any work of art needs to be judged by its own unique standards, and those of its time. Racism in movies today is a lot subtler, but certainly exists just like it did in the early 30s, and politics or no politics it doesn't detract from the greatness of this genre movie.Heartily recommended.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gable, Harlow and Astor make for one good film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A pretty good movie. Red Dust is one of the films that made Clark Gable a star and it's easy to see why. In it, he plays the kind of likable rogue character that audiences would come to know him as. Gable is Dennis Carson, the operator of a rubber plantation in Indochina, who is all business until his world is turned upside down by two women. First Vantine Jefferson (Jean Harlow), a prostitute looking for a place to lie low arrives. Then a prospector and his wife, Barbara (Mary Astor), show up at the plantation. Both women are unwelcome intruders into Carson's world at first, but soon they each end up igniting his desire. Fooling around with the floozy Vantine is easy, but things get complicated when Carson's eye falls on the married Barbara. With his more than questionable actions, any other actor might have been completely unlikeable in the role, but Gable somehow pulls it off. Harlow and Astor also give very good performances. It helps that the heavy subject matter and brash duologue, adapted from a stage play, was not watered down too much for the screen version. Definitely a well made film worth seeing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Sultry Film about Rubber Plantations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's a soap opera, but it is also a terrific film in terms of acting and emotional power. And it fits in nicely, by locale and subject matter, with Bette Davis' later film THE LETTER.Clark Gable is the manager of a rubber plantation in the Malaysian jungles (this is nine years before the Japanese invaded Malaysia). He lives there with fellow workers Tully Marshall, Donald Crisp, Forrester Harvey, and Willy Fung. Word is sent to Gable that a new man, Gene Raymond, is being sent as well. Gable (who has been going around the plantation on his duties, returns to find that someone has arrived: Jean Harlow who is a prostitute stuck until the steamer comes (which will be bringing Raymond) in about a week. The film was made before the Hollywood code was given it's teeth by the Breen office and the Catholic Legion of Decency. So Harlow's character is very salty with her double entendres, and suggestive sequences (like when she is bathing in the water tank, or when Willy Fung giggles at her antics with considerable pleasure). Even Tully Marshall gets a zinger across, regarding how he could have given her some new tricks if it was only 1894. Gable is not too happy at first (he sees Harlow as disrupting the orderly running of the plantation), but gradually he becomes used to Harlow - more than that, they are starting an affair. But the steamer arrives, and in comes Raymond - with his wife, the poised and worldly Mary Astor. Gable is quite struck by Astor, much to Harlow's dismay. This was a usual dilemma for Harlow in film after film (although occasionally she played society dames). In CHINA SEAS it was Rosalind Russell who was the rival with class. In WIFE VERSUS SECRETARY it was Myrna Loy who gave her the competition. She fights back, but she is aware that she comes across as too close to the street. Oddly enough (or sensibly enough, perhaps) MGM never thought of pairing her with or opposed to Joan Crawford as a rival.Harlow leaves, and soon Raymond comes down with malaria. Gable is now thrown together with Astor, and an affair begins. It has not progressed far when Harlow returns after the steamer develops a broken engine. Gable is carefully considering his moves vis-a-vis Astor, with Harlow making barely veiled comments about their antics. It does not sit well with Marshall, Forester, and Crisp either (Raymond is the only one who is oblivious to the situation due to illness - but he's recovering!). When Raymond is ready to take his job the matters reach the boiling point - will Gable betray his new colleague with Astor, or will he come to his senses and resume actions with Harlow?As pointed out the set is the same as that used in the same year by Joan Crawford in RAIN. It's very effective. So are such touches by Vincent Flemming as the brief sequence showing how tree sap is turned into rubber with the addition of chemicals.The characters are not really bad (except, perhaps, the surly, usually drunk Crisp - a turn from his silent villainy as "Battling Burroughs" in BROKEN BLOSSOMS - but his biggest moment of villainy is when he ignites Raymond's belated jealousy and anger at Gable by just being a big mouth). That the soap opera antics are compelling is a monument to the script's dialog, it's actors, and the director. You can't really ask for more than that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Steam Heat in the Malayan Jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One thing about the old Hollywood studios, they never let anything go to waste. Look very carefully and you'll see this is the same set on which Joan Crawford and Walter Huston filmed Rain. And the plot's real similar about some hormone driven men and women in the jungle.Clark Gable is the manager of a rubber plantation in the Malayan jungle and if the only company you had at the plantation were Tully Marshall, Donald Crisp, and Willie Fung you'd get the itch too. Along comes stranded Jean Harlow and it's hinted at that she's a working girl. Red Dust was pre-code so ladies of easy virtue were permitted. Then comes newly assigned Gene Raymond and his bride Mary Astor. She's a lady, more unattainable and hard to get. Well maybe not so hard. Testosterone and estrogen take over for Gable and Astor.Now this plot should sound very familiar and it is the one of the more recently filmed Mogambo. Mogambo in fact is a remake of Red Dust. Of course since it was shot on location in Africa where Gable is a white hunter instead of a plantation manager, it's production values put Red Dust to shame. I like Mogambo better because of that and the story line was more mature. The only flaw with Mogambo was the miscasting of Grace Kelly. Mary Astor is far her superior.One thing though, I would never want to have to pick and choose between Jean Harlow and Ava Gardner. I don't think anyone else would want to choose either. Gable is still Gable, but in 20 years time he's moved from the hardnosed cynical plantation manager to the world weary game hunter. But a man's man all the way.Of course Red Dust became notorious because of the death of Harlow's second husband, producer Paul Bern during the filming. That tragedy turned out to be a box office gold mine for MGM.Still fans of the stars will like the work they did here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>first key role at MGM for Harlow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was the one which really showcased Jean Harlow, fresh at MGM after a stint at Columbia, and a film or two as one of the muses of Howard Hughes.In real life she'd married and been widowed in quick succession, and although the Paul Bern scandal must have been a strain, it doesn't show here on screen. Harlow is absolutely luminous, a wise-cracking hardboiled good-time girl with a soft centre and a hint of innocence. What else could she be but a bright platinum blonde? Mary Astor, tight-laced and classy, arrives at the sexually-charged rubber plantation with feverish husband Gene Raymond, and catches the eye of wide-boy hard-man Clark Gable (a real he-man of the 'grab em by the hair' school).A fascinating slice of 1930s pre-Production Code history, 'Red Dust' sizzles and is always in heat. Remade as 'Mogambo' and apart from the addition of colour, some recasting (Gardner for Harlow, Grace Kelly for Astor, Donald Sinden for Raymond), it remained a heady brew, even down to the indefatigable Mr Gable reprising his role as Carson!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Excellent drama set on a rubber plantation stars Clark Gable as a rough-and- tough boss who drives his men to produce rubber in a harsh southeast Asian locale (they mention Saigon a lot). He's awaiting a new surveyor to join his small band on white men (Tully Marshall, Donald Crisp) and Asian workers. But the boat brings Jean Harlow instead, a call girl who has fled the city for a while. Gable and Harlow are terrific as they spit and snarl at each other befall falling into each others' arms. But then the new kid arrives (Gene Raymond) with a wife! Mary Astor (the wife) has one of her first great roles in talkies in this film. Her arrival sets off all kinds of sparks with Gable and with Harlow. The husband is sick right off, allowing Gable and Astor to get friendly. Great chemistry among the stars here, and a very adult script for 1932. Two memorable scenes: Harlow taking a bath in the water barrel; Gable carrying Astor through the torrential monsoon rains. Certainly ranks among the best performances of the 3 stars. Raymond has the thankless role of the wimp husband; Crisp is the drunk; Marshall is the loyal sidekick. Willie Fung (Hoy) and Forrester Harvey (Limey) round out the cast. Hard to believe Harlow is only 21 here and had already made more than 25 films, dating back to silent films in 1928. Oddly, Harlow, Astor, Gable, Marhsall, and Crisp had all started in silent films. It's wonderful to see these stars at their peak. Not to be missed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"We all slap each other out here"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The creation of a star in classic Hollywood was not just a case of finding the right man or woman, it was about creating the right persona. Clark Gable had been in movies for several years by the time of this, his breakthrough picture, first as a bit player, then as a (usually villainous) supporting actor, before finally landing romantic leading roles. It wasn't necessarily that he took time to hone his abilities (although that was some part of it); it was more that it took a long time for everyone to figure out what kind of a guy he should be.Red Dust is in many ways the perfect romantic melodrama ? a steamy exotic location, a jagged love triangle, sex that while passionate is never gratuitous, and of course the desirable lead performers. It's just the kind of setting to show Gable off at his best, allowing him to appear sweaty, unshaven and loose-shirted. Put this man in a tuxedo and he became decidedly boring, but in Red Dust he sizzles. The movie doesn't demand a great deal from him acting-wise, but he knows how to pose with an air of virility, and can carry a woman to bed without appearing rapey. Love interest number one, Jean Harlow, was never really an exceptional actress but she's at her most natural and laid back here. Love interest number two, Mary Astor, on the other hand matches Gable for sexual presence despite her well-mannered bearing. There's a lot of attraction in her ability to switch from propriety to passion. Her acting is also the best of any on display here.This was Gable's first pairing with director Victor Fleming, a craftsman whose approach really suited the manly star. Fleming's movies are all about constant movement. Actors will almost always walk as they talk. It stops the movie from ever seeming slow or dull. Fleming would coach his cast in some detail about how to act. Although Gable and Astor begin to realise their feelings for one another on a fast-paced trot through the jungle, he has them stop for a moment to give emphasis to important lines. He also has actors bark out their dialogue, and make every movement sharp, almost aggressive. And Fleming was a master shot composer, often juggling foreground and background, or knowing how to frame a really iconic moment like Gable and Astor's kiss.Although he'd had a number of leading roles before this, it was Red Dust that really sealed Gable's superstardom. His career as a desirable hero would have huge longevity, and I'm reminded of Lillian Gish's comment about the women in Hollywood ageing while the men stayed forever young. Before long Mary Astor would be playing middle-aged and increasingly minor characters, even though she remained very beautiful. Gable on the other hand continued to be a screen lover for more than two decades. When they came to remake Red Dust as Mogambo in 1953 the female roles were filled by hot young newcomers Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner. Gable, twenty-one years older, was still cast as the man they fought over.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spirited Exotic Romance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a lot of fun as long as you're not looking for poetry. It's a product of the old studio system, with actors, directors, and gofers under contract, grinding out one production after another, with a lot of seasoning and skill.Director Victor Fleming ("Gone With The Wind", etc.) was a sturdy man's man, vulgar and given to drink. Gable earned his paycheck and didn't care what the result looked like. Jean Harlow enjoyed herself, despite the long hours and the recent death of her oddball husband. Screenwriter John Lee Mahin wrote a hilarious parody of middle-brow Hollywood productions in the style of James Joyce's "Ulysses." (Last sentence: "yes -- but on a higher plane.") John Ford's remake in the mid-50s, "Mogambo", illustrates the difference that twenty years can make -- same male star, but a bigger, splashier, more worrisome production set in Africa instead of IndoChina. Gable went big game hunting. Ford thought it was disgusting.This 1932 effort takes place in a studio-bound jungle out of which Gable has carved a rubber plantation. He's been shacked up with the raucous Harlow and kicks her out before his new Administrator, Raymond, arrives. Raymond gets there on time but shows his weakness by promptly falling ill, leaving Gable alone with Raymond's inexperienced young wife, Mary Astor.Since Gable keeps tearing off his shirt at every opportunity and oozes pheromones, it isn't long before Gable sends Uriah, I mean Raymond, off for a long trek into the bush, while he balls Astor back at the Big House. By this time Harlow has returned, her exit boat having gotten stuck in the mud. She sees immediately what's up and engages in a lot of sarcastic sniping.Gable has been planning to get rid of Raymond and keep Astor for himself but discovers at the last minute that he has a heart after all. This is always the kind of realization that brings misfortune. In this case it takes the form of a bullet. But everything winds up happily, this being an old-fashioned studio production.Gable's ears are more impressive than his muscles but it doesn't matter. He's masculine enough and that's what counts. Harlow is saucy and takes a nude bath in the drinking water. That's okay with me too.As I say, it's much fun, but I did miss the usual exotic city scene with the men sporting white suits and pith helmets and an abundance of beaded curtains.</fullReview>

Later, there is a shot of Harlow as she watches Gable and Astor from a distance. The shot is a close-up and as Harlow watches them, her lower eyelids flicker just once, but it reveals more about her jealousy than any dialogue could. The film is horribly racist in its ignorant depiction of Asians but it's also over 70 years old so recognize that it was wrong, realize how far we've come, move past it and enjoy the rest.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It Sizzles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In this pre-code romance set in Indo-China Clark Gable and Jean Harlow sizzle up the screen in absolute style - this feat has never been matched up to the present day. I believe that Jean Harlow outshines Gable acting wise - she delivers her lines so well, with such ease! You can almost feel the electricity between them (despite the fact they were simply friends in real life). Gable plays a rubber plantation owner who gets involved with the wife of one of his employees, meanwhile a prostitute on the run is falling for him. Will it end happily, or in tragedy? The original of Mogambo (1953), this would be especially interesting for anyone wanting to see the original, or to Gable, Harlow, Astor fans, or just anyone who loves movies from this era. It is a piece of Hollywood history that is amazing to watch over 70 years later.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wonderful pre-Code film with Clark Gable playing a rubber plantation owner in Indochina. Jean Harlow plays a prostitute that becomes an unwanted visitor of Gable's. Unwanted for a little while, at least. She is Jean Harlow, after all! Then an engineer arrives at the plantation along with his wife (Mary Astor). Gable quickly takes an interest in Astor, tossing Harlow aside.This movie would make the career highlight reel of all involved. Good script and solid performances from all. Gable is at his charmingly gruff best. Harlow is sexy, fun, and very likable. Possibly my favorite role of hers. Astor is quite good, too. Even Gene Raymond works well and I usually can't stand him. This was remade as "Mogambo," directed by John Ford. It also stars Gable but with Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly and the setting moved to Africa. It's not as good as this one but still worth checking out. This one, though, is a classic that everybody should see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's always cool to come across an unexpected little gem like this, kind of makes you thankful for tuning in to Turner Classics on the spur of the moment and have your viewing decision made for you. This was a surprisingly entertaining film, due in large part to Jean Harlow's sassy presence as the woman of questionable virtue, Lily Vantine. You didn't really need a steamy jungle set with Harlow and Gable in tow, they pretty much provided their own. Speaking of which, this is probably the wettest picture I've ever seen. The actors must have been a mess most of the time while filming.The setting for the movie was kind of interesting I thought. Obviously located somewhere in the world like Indochina or the Phillipines, recurring reference was made to a town called Sagaing, or at least that's the way closed captioning spelled it. I pretty much decided that it must have been Saigon, so that would place the story in Vietnam some three or four decades prior to the conflict that would consume the globe throughout most of the Sixties and early Seventies. I just find that kind of fascinating.This was my first look at Gable and Harlow together and it was a pretty successful screen pairing. The arrival of Mary Astor at Denny Carson's (Gable) rubber plantation sets up the sparks that follow in a relationship I didn't quite get between her character and Carson. Though obviously attractive, I didn't see the appeal of her character to the masculine likes of Carson when someone like Vantine was around. But then again, maybe that was part of the challenge, and Gable plays it to the hilt. The idea that Carson attains a humble streak of nobility makes the resolution to the story credible, though I WAS shocked when Babs (Astor) shot Denny. Where did she get the gun? Other reviewers on this board note the racist elements in the story with some dismay, but I think you have to consider how films of the era reflected attitudes of the time. This was not uncommon, and viewing most stories like this today I don't get the impression that the film makers were supportive of racism, but were merely showing that it existed. With that in mind I think Hollywood helped in improving racial and ethnic relations over the course of time. With that said, I do have to admit that Willie Fung's Hoy was a pretty pathetic character.Besides the line of dialog in my summary quote, it appears that Harlow had all the best lines in the picture. Probably some of the best scenes too. The bath in a rain barrel is classic and is probably the one that will remain with you long after the rest of the picture fades from memory. Just one of the many bits here that make the picture such a treat for fans of pre-Code films like this.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>unmatched for sheer screen presence</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For viewers who may not be familiar with Jean Harlow, this is a terrific film to start with. Her screen presence was unmatched; certainly the sexiest actress on the silver screen until MM, and extremely well-matched with Gable. Harlow plays a sassy hooker who gets most of the clever lines ("I don't usually sleep nights.").Gable is perfectly cast as the rough plantation owner living in a thoroughly man's world with no use for women (except as playthings). The man had more screen presence in his little finger than most actors have at all. His boyishly arrogant grin after Astor slaps him is simply great.Mary Astor shines as the lady who should be above all this but who succumbs to Gable's animal magnetism. Her face as she reflects on the first wild kiss is a landscape of emotional turmoil: "Oh my God, what have I done? Wasn't it wonderful though!"--should be required viewing for any aspiring actress.There's not much plot--it's yer basic love triangle story: who's he going to end up with? The woman with class, or the sassy hooker? Astor's character is out of her depth in the jungle setting, so she's easily overwhelmed by the overly self-confident Gable-character. Gable's character is out of his depth with a woman of class; she would normally be out of reach for him anywhere else. Their dalliance makes sense only in that setting. Harlow at first snipes at her rival, Astor, but soon realizes that Astor is really only a victim and redirects her heavy artillery at Gable instead. The banter is terrific and bears rewinding as it goes by so quickly.The film lives from its dialog and clever lines. Considering that the film was made so soon after the introduction of talkies, it holds up extremely well--credit to director Fleming, no doubt. The dialog in Marocco, made two years earlier with Gary Cooper and Marlene Dietrich, was awful by comparison--stilted, wooden, very awkward, and cannot be attributed to lack of actors' ability, but lack of experience with talkies as a medium. Fleming showed that he had mastered it already.A few commentators have derided the film for being racist. DUH. The colonial powers occupying Indochina at the time were racist and probably treated the locals much more savagely than in the film. Sure it's painful to watch--it should be! Drop the political correctness nonsense and just enjoy the banter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Red Dust (1932) *** (out of 4) Victor Fleming film has Clark Gable playing a tough as nails rubber plantation owner who has a fling with a blonde (Jean Harlow) but falls in love with a married woman (Mary Astor). Here's another film I've been meaning to watch for quite a while now and it was worth the wait, although I was hoping it would be somewhat better. The film's biggest asset is the terrific cast who all give wonderful performances. This is just the type of role Gable was born to play and he has terrific chemistry with both Harlow and Astor. Gable manages to be quite a jerk but also tender at the same time, which is what made him so legendary. Harlow is very funny in her role and Astor steals the show as the woman getting in over her head. The Pre-Code elements are also very strong with Harlow constantly showing off her body and the scene in the tub is priceless. The underline sex going on throughout the film also sets it apart from other movies of its time. I think the weakest thing was some of the plot, which is pretty familiar but the ending certainly packs a nice little punch and it somewhat made me curious if the writers of Casablanca were influenced by it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gable and Harlow stir up plenty of "Red Dust" in this 1932 film also starring Mary Astor, Gene Raymond, and Donald Crisp. Harlow plays a girl of easy virtue hanging out around a rubber plantation; Gable is the manager of a rubber plantation in Malaysia. When a new engineer and his upper class wife arrive, Gable decides it might be time to send Harlow packing - but alas, her boat gets stuck in the mud and she returns. Thus the triangle begins.This is a real macho movie that shows the racism and sexism of the time, as well as the lamentable desire (still present in some quarters to this day) of killing a beautiful tiger and bringing its skin home as a trophy. YUK.Nevertheless, if one is going to watch a film set in the '30s, it's necessary not to put modern sensibilities on it. "Red Dust" is one sexy movie - Gable and Harlow just ooze with it. The evolving of Gable's screen persona is evident here: slim and hunky with a killer smile and a tough attitude, when he and Harlow look at each other, it's sheer lust. Because this is precode, the steamy relationship between the two is more vivid than it would be just two years later. Harlow is gorgeous, feisty and playful. The two make a dynamite couple. Unfortunately, their time together at MGM would be way too short due to Harlow's early death.Mary Astor is the other side of the triangle. She's very young here, exuding a classiness and sophistication in the midst of the jungle. And when she sees Gable, all that upbringing does her no good. Gene Raymond is good as her husband, clearly out of place in Malaysia.A good movie with two tremendous stars, precode and looking fabulous. You really can't ask for much more.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great for fans of Gable or Harlow.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you've never seen a Gable/Harlow movie, "Red Dust" would be a good place to start. Although this film's plot is not as strong as some of the other movies featuring this duo, their chemistry is unbeatable.Harlow plays Vantine, a 'hooker with a heart of gold' (forgive the cliché) who finds herself stranded in plantation owner Carson's house. (Carson is played by Gable in one of his most rugged and manly roles). Unfortunately for Vantine, who finds herself falling hard for Carson, one of the plantation worker's wives, Barbara (Mary Astor) is also staying in the Carson household. Carson is bewitched by Barbara's elegance and poise and soon can't be bothered with Vantine and her loud, exuberant ways.This movie only drags on once (in a scene where Gable and Harlow are separated) but other than that, it is very absorbing and romantic. Another thing that was sort of difficult to get through was Mary Astor's character in the movie. She manages to cry through nearly every scene, making the viewer feel nothing but an annoyance with her character.However, Gable and Harlow make up for all this with a particularly steamy performance. A glance between those two is somehow sexier than any love scene could ever be and they share enough steamy moments together to keep the viewer transfixed.All in all, a great movie for Gable or Harlow fans, but for those who are hoping to see Mary Astor at her best, I would look elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Red Hot Dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Golden Age fans will love this one, a Pre-Code film that's much like a filmed stage play - in fact, it's based on a play which, by all accounts was even racier than the movie. It was made in 1932 and certainly couldn't pass muster after the inception of the Hays Office, but nowadays anything goes; odd someone hasn't tried. They would be hard-pressed, though, to find a better cast, especially the two principals. Gable and Harlow are perfect together, the animal magnetism fairly leaping off the screen. Gable was the very model of modern masculinity at the time, and Harlow his female counterpart.Some reviewers noted an element of racism woven throughout the picture, but they should give it a rest. The world in general and society in particular were vastly different from the modern PC era. Also of interest is the support cast, headed by Mary Astor, who admittedly was a better actress than Harlow but minus the manifest 'feminine wiles'. In a departure from more dignified roles, Donald Crisp plays vulgar drunk and to excellent effect.Have you seen it? If not, do so. It's well worth your time just to see how the 'pros' used to do it, inherent plot flaws notwithstanding.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jungle Fever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>RED DUST (Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1932), directed by Victor Fleming, is a red hot movie featuring the steamy collaboration of Clark Gable and Jean Harlow in their first starring roles together. Having been featured in secondary roles opposite Wallace Beery in the crime drama, THE SECRET SIX (MGM, 1931, RED DUST establishes Gable and Harlow, with their italic labeled names above the title, as the latest box-office draw. Coming in the wake of jungle related stories as TRADER HORN (1931) and TARZAN THE APE MAN (1932), or Harlow's floozy character somewhat inspired by W. Somerset Maugham's own Sadie Thompson lifted from RAIN (United Artists, 1932), RED DUST, set in a remote location of Indo-China, no doubt was a huge success at the time. Watching the chemistry between Gable and Harlow shows the reason why.Taken from the play by Wilson Collison, the plot revolves around Dennis Carson (Clark Gable) in charge of a rubber plantation assisted by McQuarg (Tully Marshall) and Guidon (Donald Crisp). Upon their return from Saigon by boat, Carson encounters Vantine (Jean Harlow), a tough talking blonde babe of questionable background ("I'm not used to sleeping at night") eluding the Saigon police, found on the bed of the drunken Guidon. Carson, ("I've been looking at her kind ever since my voice changed"), allows Vantine ("Pollyanna, the Glad Girl") to remain on the plantation headquarters until the next boat arrives. Though they have a rocky start constantly arguing, Dennis and Vantine soon come to mutual terms. As Vantine leaves on the next boat, Dennis goes to greet Gary Willis (Gene Raymond), a young engineer to be his new assistant. Aside from being stricken with fever, Gary surprises Dennis by introducing him to his new bride, Barbara (Mary Astor). Later, due to the boat getting stuck in the mud, Vantine returns to the plantation and Dennis' life. After Gary recovers from his illness, Dennis sends him away on assignment assisted by McQuarg and Guidon to supervise the construction of a jungle bridge. In the meantime, Dennis, having already had a relationship with Vantine, finds himself doing the same with Gary's wife.If the plot sounds overly familiar, in true Hollywood essence of "great movies are not made, they're remade," the basis of RED DUST reappeared in CONGO MAISIE (MGM, 1940), the second of the "Maisie" series starring Ann Sothern, and officially remade more famously as MOGAMBO (MGM, 1953) with the much older Clark Gable repeating his original role with different character name. Stretched out to nearly two hours as opposed to the original's 83 minutes, MOGAMBO, set in Africa, has Ava Gardner ("Honey Bear") and Grace Kelly (Linda) in the Astor and Harlow roles. MOGAMBO proved to be Gable's last great motion picture for MGM before leaving his home-based company after 23 years of service. The advantage MOGAMBO has over RED DUST is the fact that MOGAMBO does not have the studio bound with stage origin feel to it, yet, greatly benefits in both Technicolor and actual location shooting in Africa. The advantages RED DUST has over MOGAMBO is the fact the movie is very much pre-code, with situations and toned-down vulgar talk between Harlow and Gable. Other classic Harlow moments include her bathing in a barrel of drinking water; reading Peter Rabbit stories to Dennis; and her presentation of a tough girl with a heart of gold. With Harlow having a reputation of not being such a good actress, under Victor Fleming's direction, she's actually quite effective here as well as alluring. Mary Astor as the dignified wife who falls into Gable's charms, comes off as second best. Gene Raymond is acceptable as the young man who looks up to his employer, but clueless to what's happening behind his back. With a small assortment of players listed in the cast, there's also Forrester Harvey as Limey, and Willie Fung assuming his usual stereotypical broken English speaking Chinese ("Ah lite") for comedy assurance.Though the leading players prove more favorable than the title of RED DUST (RED LUST might have been more like it), the film itself is a classic in its own right. As in situations of remakes versus originals, it does leave the old question as to which movie is better, RED DUST or MOGAMBO. Distributed to home video in the 1980s, and later into DVD decades later, RED DUST continues to entertain whenever broadcast, sometimes on a double bill with MOGAMBO, on Turner Classic Movies.

		<shortDescription>Gable and Harlow at their best!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wilson Collison was the co-author of "Up in Mabel's Room" and "Getting Gertie's Garter". This play, both his only non-farce and the only play he wrote alone to be produced on Broadway, opened at Daly's on 2 January 1928, closing after only 8 performances. Curtis Cooksey and Sydney Shields starred for producer Hugo W. Romberg. The director was Ira Hards. Broadway's disaster became Hollywood's success. M-G-M remade the movie twice, first as "Congo Maisie" in 1940, with John Carroll, Ann Sothern, Shepperd Strudwick and Rita Johnson; then as Mogambo (1953), again with Clark Gable in the lead. Here's Gable as we really like him. Tough, no-nonsense, aggressively self-centered, almost completely dominating the action from go to whoa, knocking out whoever stands in his way, both physically and verbally. The other players have a hard time standing up to him, but all except Donald Crisp (whose role is both small and unsympathetic) manage surprisingly well. True, Harlow often seems to be just mechanically mouthing her lines, but fortunately the dialogue carries its own special zing and doesn't require any pushing. What's more, there's no denying Harlow looks the part. Maybe a bit too glamorous and not quite the sloven Collison had in mind, but who's complaining? One could also gripe that Miss Astor's Adrian lingerie seems an odd choice for the jungle, but once again there are no murmurs of dissent from this critic's corner. I could also make a crack about the script's resemblance to a photographed stage play, though it has often been opened up rather effectively. Most of the exterior scenes are further enlivened by Fleming's fluid tracking shots. It's only when the camera recedes from M-G-M's vast backlot into the less salubrious and more cramped quarters of Gable's soundstage bungalow that the play and its handling become stagey. Adding to this slight but unwelcome theatrical effect is the complete absence of background music. In fact the only music in the movie covers merely the front (ending abruptly as soon as the film itself commences) and end credits. Aside from the noticeable lack of music, "Red Dust" has been realized on a grand scale with especially fine photography and sets. Gable's make-up is excellent too. He sports no mustache in this one, but is charismatically unkempt and unshaven at the beginning of Harlow hostilities. To contrast with his pursuit of Astor, he cleans himself up a treat. For a 2014 audience willing to forgive or overlook its more blatant "theatre", "Red Dust" is a powerful, whip-cracking, romantic melodrama.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of the thousands of movies I've seen, I have never seen a screen couple who come anywhere near close to the sheer sexual dazzle of Jean Harlow and Clark Gable in 'Red Dust'. The screenplay is great but they lift it to a level unmatched.Full credit to Mary Astor for creating the dynamic - you'll never see a movie with as wonderful a sexual tension. While this was post-Hays code, it was released shortly before the Catholic Church-driven Legion Of Decency crackdown on perceptions of natural humanity.Being a relatively early sound film, there's little camera work other than 'kinda close-up' and 'kinda backed off'. But it matters not a whit. Harlow and Gable are the best screen couple you will ever see.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is problematic to identify with a reprehensible leading man, and that's the worthwhile opportunity this movie affords. Clark Gable plays an interesting character, an able and capable master of an unsupervised and inhospitable domain. I used to think Mr. Gable was a one-tone actor. He's far more multi-layered when teamed with Jean Harlow, and she's too smart and articulate for words. The three person dynamic of her always near Gable and Mary Astor is charming and even funnier since Gable takes it as a given. The sound recording technique still seems new in this movie so I miss some of the casually spoken dialog, but whenever I catch more of it, it is always a riot. The atmosphere is detailed and perfect. There is so much to see. The movie looks like it's leading toward tragedy; what a pleasure to arrive at a comedy payoff...Mary Astor is quite beautiful too, and in thinking back I suggest she's entitled to some sympathy and justification, since she succumbs to a man shifting his weight in an isolated position of a power. Anyway, let her and her husband (Gene Raymond) live the hypocrisies of civilized society... Bring those rubber trees to Fordlandia!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>My second Gable film that I ever saw, I was flabbergasted by how racy this film was. Doesn't it make it even more lovable? Clark Gable stars as Dennis "Denny" Carson, who happens to be in charge of a rubber plantation in Indonesia. One of his partners returns on a boat with lovable Vantine (played by the ravishing Jean Harlow) and things merely heat up from there. Metro made a fantastic pairing of young Gable and very-blonde Harlow, for she knew how to beat him at his own game. This movie is very famous in its own right: Paul Bern, Harlow's then husband, committed suicide during filming and it made the most money in 1932, a million dollars. Not bad for the Depression. A great film, so make sure to watch for it on Turner Classic Movies!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The plot is just a framework for some great precode moments</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The setting is the tropics of Indochina, a rubber plantation to be specific. Dennis Carson (Clark Gable) is the owner of the rubber plantation, beset by the constant troubles - both human and natural - of running such a farm in a primitive place. Constantly surrounded by men, one day Dennis finds he has double trouble on his hands. First the prostitute Vantine (Jean Harlow) is foisted upon him because she is giving the law a wide berth due to her profession, and this looks like a nice secluded spot to lay low. Vantine actually falls for Dennis - she playfully calls him Fred - however, Dennis just thinks he is another john and that it's all in a day's work to Vantine.To add to his troubles, Dennis' new surveyor brings his wife, Barbara, along (Mary Astor), and the only place fit for a woman to live is in Dennis' home. Dennis sends the surveyor on a long stay in the jungle "to increase production", but he really just wants some alone time with Barbara, and Barbara returns the sentiment. Before her husband returns from the jungle Dennis and Barbara have fallen in love, but do they have the heart to tell her young husband? Watch and find out.There really is not much of a plot in this film other than to give a steamy lusty setting to a steamy lusty tale. This is a precode film, but if you analyze it frame by frame it is completely tame by today's standards. Even given the freedom of the precode era there were limits as to what could be shown, and thus almost everything is insinuated and it is up to the viewer to mentally project what happens. To me, this makes this film very erotic versus the biology lessons of today's films that show everything. Of course you do have some great visual cues, mainly Harlow's on-the-level prostitute bouncing about Dennis' home scantily clad and of course there's Harlow's famous bath in a rain barrel scene. Mary Astor's prim and proper Babs is a great contrast to Harlow's character as she gets swept up in events bigger than herself - her affair with Dennis - yet still seems to act like she thinks she's better than Vantine. Vantine's catty remarks, as she is hurt by Dennis' rejection of her, are classic Harlow all the way.This is one of my favorite precode films, and I heartily recommend it to anybody who enjoys films from the precode era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I saw this with "Star Spangled Rhythm" which features Betty Hutton. I was bowled over by her screen energy, but not even that prepared me for this.Jean just completely dominates this rather tepid story with her crackling crisp dialog. What she delivers she does outside of the story which is supposed to have her watching a film romance between "her" man and someone else's woman. A good writer would have invented something other than the simple sassyness we have here, especially since we already have a bird as an observer. But this was before Sturges.But no matter, its just great to watch controlled exuberance. I think Clara Bow had it. Marilyn only pretended and I suppose that was good enough at the time. Are there only a few?Screen energy is so rare, I suppose because after about 38 or 40, Hollywood movies started to take on an energy outside of the characters. Actors had to fit in unless if it was truly cinematic, and that automatically introduces constraints on the energy. So we get a different kind of honesty and appeal, either a smile (like the pampered Julia) or raw risk (like Emily Watson in "Breaking the Waves").Although the Vietnam environment is pretty stagy, it does reflect on some rather heavy colonial attitudes that were then current, (though the exploiters in this case would be French).I have no idea what the title means. Perhaps it was clear in the original play. Which also probably did more with the character played by Crisp.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The owner of a rubber plantation (Clark Gable) becomes involved with the new wife (Mary Astor) of one of his employees (Gene Raymond).The movie was remade by director John Ford in 1953 as "Mogambo", this time set in Africa rather than Indochina and shot on location in color, with Ava Gardner in the Harlow role and Grace Kelly playing Astor's part. Clark Gable returned, twenty-one years later, to play the same character. Ford used African tribal music as the film's score.I like the idea of a film set in French Indochina, especially one made in the 1930s. Now, all anyone associated with the region is the Vietnam War (both the French and later American parts), and it is interesting to see it from another angle -- although, in a sense, it is sort of the same angle. This is very much a film about Western colonialism, even if that was not the original intent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A Product of its Time in Hollywood, this is a Stunning Star Pairing that was Indicative of a Clark Gable and Jean Harlow Personification of Their On Screen Personalities. Gable the Man's Man and Harlow the Free Spirited "inner woman" with the Libido on Full Display.The Film is Famous for its Pre-Code Sexuality Literally Dripping off the Screen. The Movie's Backdrop of the Jungle Drenched in Torrential Rain and Exuding Primal Instincts. The Banter is Double Talk and Sarcastic and Mary Astor's Naive Newly Wed Vulnerability is Laid Open for the Predatorial and Unrestrained Promiscuous Gable to take Advantage.This is Basic and Raw Stuff. The Pulp Fiction of Romance and Rough Housing among the Willing and before it was Taboo on Screen to Shine a Bedroom Light on such things. The Movie is Entertaining and it has been Pointed Out that it Contains much Racism. It does so with Uncomfortable Realism that just like the Sex was and is a part of Life that in an Historical Context, is better Explored than Expunged</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Harlow and Gable heat up the jungle</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Directed by Victor Fleming,with a screenplay by John Mahin,Red Heat pairs two of the biggest stars of the thirties,Jean Harlow and Clark Gable. Set in the deepest jungles of Malaysia the film sees just how far the moral standards of the day could be pushed. The screen practically burns apart from the lust of the two leads whenever they're together.On a quiet rubber plantation in Malaysia, things heat up when the quick tempered manager,Dennis Carson(Clark Gable)falls for two different women.There's tough talking woman of the night,Vantine(Jean Harlow) and the fragile,pampered,uptown girl,Barbara Willis(Mary Astor). Barbara's husband Gary(Gene Raymond)is a new employee on the plantation.Further complications ensue when Gary comes down with a tropical fever and a big storm starts heading towards the plantation.The daily life of the plantation would be explored in a little more detail in the 50's remake Mogambo(with Gable reprising his role alongside Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly). The real star of this film is Jean Harlow,she gets the best lines and makes her presence felt so strongly in every scene she's in that you wish she were in all of them.If there's a weak point here it's the love triangle.It never really gets off the ground due to the casting of Astor.Never at any time can you buy Barbara as a serious rival for Carson's affections,she's too whiny and under-developed,as opposed to the feisty Vantine.Those issues aside though what's here is a lot of fun,the acting is solid,Gable is at his most rugged and much of the dialogue is rather naughty(given the era)to say the least, and the film is a great deal of fun because of it.Memorable scenes include Harlow taking a bath in full view of everyone on the plantation and Gable rescuing Astor from the tropical storm,well worth a watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Typical Gable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Red Dust sets the tone for Clark Gable's usual character in movies. He is rough, tough, loud, physical, hard-drinking, and domineering. He also shows some of his typical humorous and softer sides, but not as much as in later movies he made. Jean Harlow is a perfect foil for him in this movie, holding her own in their conflict scenes and a perfect match in their love scenes. There is not much to the story, and it's all light-weight action, but there are some good dialog exchanges between Gable and Harlow, well-tuned to their personalities and acting styles. The movie is consistent with the adventure-type films Gable made throughout his career.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Movie Odyssey Review #069: Red Dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>069: Red Dust (1932) - released 10/22/1932; viewed 6/24/06.KEVIN: We first saw Gable at the premiere of 'Grand Hotel' on that film's DVD. He doesn't seem to have a warming up period in this film, but is instead already at the top of his game here as Dennis, the rubber plantation owner. As is Jean Harlow, who we've seen three times before but never as cool or as sassy as she is here playing floozy Vantine (what a great name). Mary Astor (as Barbara) and Jean Harlow make an excellent pair and there's great contrast in their two characters. I got excited when they first appeared on screen together, because I knew things were going to get interesting. The character of Gary, Barbara's husband, is kind of underutilized, mainly because there's all this dysfunction going on around him and he's unaware of it. The climax definitely caught me off guard. I didn't expect Barbara to shoot him. The ending felt kind of abrupt. I say kind of, because I did feel it coming. When I felt it coming I was surprised that that was the end. I thought, "Hmm...well, I guess there's really nothing more to say." I haven't seen a film this lean on story since 'Anna Christie.'DOUG: Sex and passion flow at an Indochina rubber plantation in Victor Fleming's steamy Pre-Code drama 'Red Dust.' This film introduces us to Clark Gable, who's without his mustache at this point. He also doesn't wear an undershirt (as we see again in 'It Happened One Night'). No warm up is needed, as Gable is already acting at the top of his game. This is the forth film we've seen Jean Harlow in (after 'Hell's Angels,' 'The Public Enemy,' 'The Platinum Blonde'), and she finally gets a really juicy role here. She's very sassy, dropping one snarky and suggestive one-liner after another. I just barely recognized Donald Crisp, who was so wonderfully scary way back in 'Broken Blossoms.' My only real problem with the movie was the character of Hoy, played by Willie Fung, who does everything he can to offend Chinese people everywhere every moment he's on screen. The ending is a bit abrupt, but it's basically a happy one for all (even though somebody gets shot). I didn't think she was going to shoot him either. I fear that in watching all these Pre-Code movies together, we're taking all the things that could make it onto the screen for granted. It will be a sad time indeed when we reach the point where the Code is enforced and all the juicy violence, bawdy language, nudity, and kissing will abruptly vanish.Last film: Trouble in Paradise (1932). Next film: Night After Night (1932).</fullReview>

Here's old Mary Astor talking like the Queen Mother and Gene Raymond (well he actually was what the character was supposed to be) and then you have Harlow, dousing in the water-drinking barrel, scraping off bird poop and exclaiming, "Whatcha been eating' - cement?" to the unwitting bird. Gable goes from Mary Astor, seated on a stool to even kiss him in one of their "magic" moments to Harlow, sawing her nails and pulling up her dress over those gorgeous legs - heck, was there nothing gorgeous about Jeanie from KCMO? Red Dust? I have seen it so many times I could do the dialog. The star in "Red Dust" - well Clark Gable is a close but Jean Harlow wins.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Red Dust" is a great movie. It really shows off Harlow and Gable when they were at the hight of their stardom. When are we going to be seeing this movie on DVD, Ted Turner, or maybe included as a group with the Signature Collection? Jean Harlow is hot and this movie shows off her legs better than "Hell's Angels" or "Public Enemy" ever did. I've always had a fatal weakness for Clark Gable too, even though his characters are always tough on the "hired help". In "Red Dust" he's slapping around his Vietnamese rubber plantation workers which could explain why we haven't seen this on DVD yet. I'm sure that if you asked a Vietnamese person that they would agree that this stuff went on over there.I won't explain the plot to you as the previous posters do an excellent job of this. It is very much worth watching, if only to see Two great actors showing off their talents.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>super-sleazy pre-code tale of lust (cool)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was not exactly meant to be Shakespeare nor appeal to film snobs. Nope. This movie is pure unadulterated 1930s pre-code sleaze! Now, some might see this as a terrible thing, but today it's really a lot of fun to see just how far some films from major studios pushed the film making envelope. There is little doubt that just a year or two later, this film would have not been made and its 1950s remake, MOGAMBO, is a lot tamer and sophisticated film.In MOGAMBO, Gable is a hunter and tracker that takes rich slobs on safaris. In RED DUST, he works at a rubber plantation in Southeast Asia. Along the way, he meets up with a cheap but sweet dame (Jean Harlow) but soon forgets about her when he is introduced to sophisticated (but also trampy) Mary Astor. Astor and Gable fall in love (it's really more like "lust") but don't know what to do about Astor's decent husband. The only one who REALLY knows what to do is Harlow, that insists Gable run off with her and leave that marriage intact. Well, what happens next is for you to see. The film is great for fans of Gable or Harlow and is fine entertainment on a purely unsophisticated level.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A sizzler to some, but really just a tepid tryst in the tropics</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some movie buffs seem to think that if a movie is "pre-code" it must be good. Or, if it "sizzles," it must be interesting. Well, I like a good number of Hollywood movies made before the Hays Office enforced the studios' own code. Some definitely have sizzle. Others don't but they're good. There also are some real stinkers. Most are somewhere in between. I think a film needs more than sizzle to be very good ? whether "pre-code" or later. It should have a good plot and screenplay. It should have good production qualities. It should have good sets, good camera work and good direction and editing. And the cast should all give good performances. "Red Dust" has an interesting plot, and it has lots of sizzle. But unfortunately, it suffers in most other areas. The only very good performance in the film is Jean Harlow as Vantine. Harlow has true talent that never seems to be wasted in any of her films. She has a persona of a tough cookie, and often naughty girl in most of her films ? comedy or dramatic. I would like to have seen her in a different type of dramatic role, and in a wacky comedy to see how she could handle such roles. Unfortunately, she died at age 26 from blood poisoning due to kidney failure.As much as I like Clark Gable as an actor, I think he way overacts here in his character as Dennis Carson. And, for the first half of the film, he's a very unlikable fellow. We know Gable can be boisterous and cantankerous, but he's loud, complaining and grouchy to the point of being obnoxious in the early part of this film. Now, in contrast, Mary Astor plays way under her role. She gives the impression of one just biding her time as this soap opera plays out. Her performance seems wooden throughout the film. As Barbara Willis, she arrives with her husband on a boat at the rubber plantation upstream in a country of SE Asia. She changes at the drop of a coin from a prim and proper attitude at the start, to a withdrawn, apologetic milquetoast in the next scene, and then to a very familiar and perky person for a short time. Talk about mood switches in a movie. When Dennis comes on to her so quickly and blatantly, she seems to easily slip into adultery with so little struggle. Tully Marshall and Donald Crisp are OK in their roles as McQuarg and Guidon. Gene Raymond as Gary Willis is just so-so. He seems too fragile and out of place ? and not because he comes down with Malaria. Perhaps they made his character that way for greater contrast with the rugged, crude and vulgar Dennis. But, I think it made the direction and casting seem weaker. Willie Fung's role as the giggling Malaysian cook, Hoy, is goofy. The rest of the supporting cast are mostly native workers.Some others have noted that the set was recycled from another film or two. It doesn't appear to have weathered very well. Pun aside, most of the settings for this movie had the feel of being on stage. I am in a different frame of mind when watching a play on stage, than I have when watching a movie. With a play, I know it's constrained and confined, so I delve more into the plot. With movies, I imagine that we're looking at a scene set in a house surrounded by lawns and woods or city, or in the outdoors that runs on and on. So I know that the characters could suddenly move outside or take off in a car. It has a sense of openness and looking down on real life from an eagle's vantage point. The production quality of the DVD I watched is quite poor. Apparently Victor Fleming directed this film, but he's not credited for it. I wouldn't think he would care that much, because this is far inferior to most of his work. I give "Red Dust" six stars for the sizzle and Jean Harlow's acting. She is a hooker with a good heart who falls for Dennis. The soap opera ending was almost laughable. Although, Gable came close to convincing one that he had repented and didn't want to ruin the nice kid, Gary's marriage. This is an early look at Gable in the days before he grew a mustache.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lust and Clothing in Southeast Asia</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In Southeast Asia, rugged plantation owner Clark Gable (as Dennis "Denny" Carson) is annoyed to discover an overweight drunk in his rustic jungle home. He tosses the bum in a bed and discovers platinum blonde prostitute Jean Harlow (as Vantine Jefferson) laying there in the sheets. The two are mutually attracted and begin copulating when the camera drifts out of range. Shipwrecked and stranded, Ms. Harlow starts to imagine a commitment, but Mr. Gable states, "I'm not a one woman man." Gable next sets his sights on ladylike but lusty Mary Astor (as Barbara Willis), who arrives with her ailing husband Gene Raymond (as Gary Willis) for hunting and surveying. He is impressed with Gable's hunting prowess while she checks out her host's animal magnetism..."Red Dust" provided film-goers with the irresistible prospect of seeing Gable and Harlow saunter around half-naked (something acknowledged in the film's script). They still have the attraction, while Ms. Astor manages to hold most of her own during her time on screen. Stalwart character actors Tully Marshall and Donald Crisp are also nice to see ? fully clothed. But giving them all competition for getting attention is Chinese housekeeper Willie Fung (as Hoy); originally good for a few chuckles, his character is almost jaw-dropping today, buck teeth and all. Also interesting is that Gable was still taking off his shirt and chasing women as "Red Dust" became "Mogambo" (1953) over 20 years later. Don't imagine Harlow and Astor would be asked to reprise their roles.****** Red Dust (10/22/32) Victor Fleming ~ Clark Gable, Jean Harlow, Mary Astor, Gene Raymond</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Love triangle--or quadrangle--at Southeast Asian rubber plantation</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Out in the jungles of south-east Asia there are westerners running rubber plantations. Three days by boat from Saigon?here pronounced "say gone"?is the plantation owned by Denny Carson (Clark Gable). A surprisingly pretty blonde just shows up one day, explaining that she'd gotten in trouble along the river and thought it best to lie low a while. She's Vantine Jefferson (Jean Harlow), and she's no better than she should be. Even though Denny is a terrible bully, always pushing his "lazy coolies" around and treating Vantine like dirt, she breaks through to him with amusing chatter about Rocquefort and Gorgonzola cheese. They "hook up," as the current parlance would have it, and when she leaves on the boat after a while Denny hands her money. Idiot. Then on the scene comes the new surveyor, Gary Willis (Gene Raymond), young and green and ill with malaria?and along with him comes his wife Barbara (Mary Astor), obviously used to and expecting better things. There's friction between her and Denny, and between her and Vantine, who's returned. And the friction between Babs and Denny turns heated while her husband has been sent away to survey an exceedingly wet part of the jungle. A rotten trick. The love story is supposed to be heated, what with Gable's manly grasping and Astor's melting eyes?and she looks pretty good in thin, summer-weight rain-soaked clothes, too. Denny's all set to tell Willis, but hearing the young man talk about his plans, he has a change of heart. He rides six hours back from the wet jungle camp and drinks and kisses Vantine, telling her with disgusted tones he's turned all angelic. Babs sees them rolling about, and Denny explains he was just using her, and she shoots him just as her suspicious husband arrives. Babs stands there shaking and Vantine pipes up with the right lie, that Denny had been after her relentlessly and she finally shot him, and Willis believes the story. All is well, with Denny and Vantine, who suit each other, together. The plot is grade B melodrama, weighed down by the colonialist subtext?somebody has to get the rubber from the jungle to the balloon tires, and the coolies won't do anything if they're not bullied into it, and weighed down by the pervasive racism, and weighed down by the incredibly annoying notion that a tall, handsome, arrogant, misogynistic brute is the ultimate in sex appeal, and weighed down by the utterly predictable love triangle plot. The only thing that saves the movie is the fizzy dialogue between Harlow and Gable, and the jaunty, sexy, teasing flirtatiousness of Harlow, who brightens every scene she's given.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Really disappointing - only Jean Harlow shined</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm a big fan of older movies, esp. the so-called "pre-codes", and so I was really looking forward to seeing this classic. Was I ever disappointed! On the plus side: Jean Harlow. Great, as always! She played her character with lots of wit and intelligence. The only time this movie was enjoyable was when Jean Harlow was on screen. She had lots of great lines and delivered them with her usual, natural humor.The negatives: Clark Gable and Mary Astor and the whole entire dumb story! I assume we are supposed to like Clark's character (Denny, the man who runs the rubber plantation), but I found nothing about him to like or root for or sympathize with. First of all, Denny is a DOLT for initially turning down Jean Harlow ... I mean, c'mon, she's gorgeous and smart and funny! Then he uses her for sex (which Jean is OK with), but when it comes time for them to part several weeks later, Jean is looking for a little affection, maybe a hug or kiss goodbye, and Clark stuffs some money down her cleavage. Niiiiiiiiice - what a jerk! Then married, goody-two-shoes Mary Astor comes on the scene (accompanying her husband who has been recently hired as a surveyor for the rubber plantation), and Clark goes ga-ga over her. Give me a break! Mary Astor is decent enough looking, but her character was a complete and total simpering wussy! I found it very unbelievable that a rough and tumble free-spirited guy like Denny would prefer the Mary Astor character over the Jean Harlow character.Trying not to ruin the plot too much, but when Denny turns all "noble" and gives up Mary Astor (who was going to run away with Denny after Denny told her hubby about the two of them - Mary Astor's character didn't even have the guts to tell her own husband she was leaving him, she was such a wimp!) just because Mary's husband told Denny about how much he (hubby) loved his wife and he would be nothing without her .... well, it seems very unlikely that a cad like Denny would all of a sudden turn noble. So, exit Mary Astor and hubby, leaving Denny and Jean Harlow behind on the plantation. Denny "returns" to Harlow (she being the only available woman left to him). Harlow's character deserved much better than gratefully accepting Denny's "settling" for what was in his mind second best.This movie left me mad and sad for Jean Harlow's character, and very disappointed at this famous classic pre-code that was supposed to be so great. I love me my down-n-dirty pre-codes, but I just didn't "get" this one. Very disappointing. Jean Harlow, though, was her usual fantastic self. 3 stars for her, -7 for the dreck she was surrounded by!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's 1932. You're not white. Oh boy is right. Red Dust is an excellent movie. It has signature performances by the great stars, Harlowe and Gable. Every aspect of it's greatness has been duly and extensively noted and they are all perfectly true. This movie should not be missed by anyone. However it is not just a movie, it is a historical document. As a historical document it it should also not be missed by anyone. It gives you a real good look at the problems and weaknesses of American culture in the thirties. When you have to take a human being and make him act stupider than a monkey in order to satisfy your own racial conceits you are in a heap of trouble. This was the state of our culture in the thirties. (I say "our" because I live in Canada but I'm an American). We have to look at this stuff so we can appreciate what people of color were going through in those days. Look at Willie Best in High Sierra, it's excruciating. Non-whites were being used for comic relief and nothing else. So what of the big stars? What are they thinking? I don't know. But one thing I think is very important is that they should not be referred to as "idols". They aren't idols, they are human beings. You don't pray to them. If you want to pray, you pray to God, not Clark Gable. As performers, Gable and Harlowe get 10 out of 10. For commitment to the cause of racial justice, they pull zeroes. When you look at this movie, you look at the extraordinary talent that made legends of these people. You also use your head, figure out what the mistakes are, and try real hard not to make the same ones yourself. That's how you look at this movie. It's also how you look at America. There's no need for a big hysterical kerfluffle about it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fatally marred by racist elements</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Red Dust" may well define the term "museum piece." Although stars Clark Gable and Jean Harlow are in top form, the film is marred by its starkly racist depiction of the Asian characters, particularly the Chinese houseboy.Other elements of the film are strong, including the bold, sexy performance from Gable. Harlow's comic gifts are on fine display, especially in the scene where she confronts Mary Astor about the fact that Gable came out of her room with rouge on his mouth. "I suppose he asked to borrow your lipstick," she snaps, making the line both cutting and hilarious.Fans who know Astor only from her later works in "The Maltese Falcon" and "Meet Me in St. Louis" will be interested to see her here in a very young role. She was only 24 or 25 and although she tends to overact at times, her performance is strong overall."Red Dust" is also interesting because it was made just two years before the Production Code came into effect, banning all sorts of suggestive dialogue and situations. Filmmakers were still relatively free at this point, and "Red Dust" offers the perfect balance of sexuality and restraint.When Gable nobly decides to send Astor back to her husband, he sardonically remarks that he's taken up wings and a halo. Harlow takes the news with delight, and heading up to her room, archly tells him, "You can check the wings and halo at the desk." "I'll be right up," he replies. You have to look long and hard to find films with that kind of snap today.Unfortunately, all these strengths can't save the film from its fundamental racism. Set on a rubber plantation in Indochina, the story portrays all the Asian characters as stupid and/or lazy. Gable tosses water on a group of resting natives at one point (they apparently shouldn't mind working under the blazing mid-day sun) and later berates them for not wanting to work in an area where a man-eating tiger has been spotted. (Gee, those stupid natives.)Worst of all is the Chinese houseboy, a perfect example of the Hollyood caricatures of the 30s. Every line he speaks is delivered with hysterical giggling and the prominent display of enormous buck teeth. It's a true shame that so many of his scenes are with Harlow and help illustrate her jealousy towards Astor's character. Otherwise, modern video makers and cable TV execs could just edit him out.</fullReview>
