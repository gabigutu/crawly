		<shortDescription>Ava's greatest performance.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>"Mogambo" is a remake of "Red Dust" (1932) and is not as good, nor as funny, but it's still not bad at all. Poor Clark Gable must choose between Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly. With both actresses at the height of their beauty this is a tough call - but I would have taken Ava any day. She is stunning in this film - sultry, sexy and warm - very different to the flighty sex kitten that Jean Harlow played so brilliantly in "Red Dust". And Ava is photographed lovingly, in gorgeous colour, by Robert Surtees and Freddie Young. She deserved her Oscar nomination.Kelly is good too as the rather prissy wife of a very English scientist. But she's too nice - Ava is much more real. Gable was a bit old for the role here - after all it was 21 years after he first played it in "Red Dust" - but his performance is strong.Great African scenery and animals too - "Mogambo" got out of the studio that confined "Red Dust". Who could forget Ava trying to feed a very hungry baby elephant and a baby rhino at the same time? The gorilla sequence was a little weak - in that the film stock used to film the gorillas was completely different to that used to film the actors - and the actors were obviously in a studio. But most of the work is on location and stunningly shot.You'll have fun with this one.PS In the canoe scene are they really talking about female circumcision?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>In Loving Memory of my Father</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I would like to share with those of you who might be interested to know that my Father Mr Abiodun Oke Hughes was part of the tribal cast in this film. I remember growing up with that in mind and though I did a search for the cast tribe here on this site, unfortunately there wasn't one available to me.So I wanted to do this, so all concerned would know how much we all still have the fondest memories of all his wondrous adventures while he was growing up.Dad was only just in his 30's when this film was made and when I captured that 5 second shot of him out in the jungle, though it's only for a few seconds it still makes me proud to see it.It still amazes me to know that my Dad worked along side the most unforgettable stars.I guess I'm very proud to know the things I do about him. So I'd like to add my Father's memory for those of you out there, not only for my Family but also for my Dad. (may he rest in peace) So here's to you Daddy.Abiodun Oke Hughes (19-12 to 19-86) We all love and Miss youRuth x</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unusual John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a strange, but good picture coming from John Ford. It's not about the usual themes he normally tackles, it lacks the usual supporting cast from a Ford film. Yet it is a good piece of movie making.In a biography of John Ford by his grandson he said that Gable and Ford were friends for years, not particularly close, but friends nonetheless. Whenever they were together Ford and Gable talked about working together. Finally Gable got MGM to get Ford for his next film and it was Mogambo.I like Mogambo because it was the start of a trend in Hollywood to show some realism when dealing with Africa. To this day there are people in the United States whose knowledge about things African were gained from Tarzan movies. African Queen, King Solomon's Mines, and Mogambo were all shot on location and all show the native Africans in reality. I was a kid at this time and my first bit of education about Africa came from Ramar of the Jungle. This is light years better.Gable was criticized for reprising a role he did 20 years earlier in Red Dust. The plot line stays the same, but in Red Dust, Gable is the hard-nosed manager of a rubber plantation in Malaya. Gable as Vic Marswell here is a world weary and cynical game hunter and safari guide. Both portrayals are very good and very different.By all accounts it was not a happy set. The usual problems with location in Africa presented themselves. In addition Frank Sinatra was on the set. He was waiting on word whether he would get the part he sought in From Here To Eternity. At the time he was married to Ava Gardner and there's was one of the most tempestuous marriages in Hollywood history. He was jealous of Gable as he was of all Gardner's leading men. To be just Ava kind of encouraged the jealous. When Harry Cohn gave him the word about From Here To Eternity he left with the gratitude of Ford, Gable, Gardner and everyone else, he'd become a royal pain in the neck.Ava Gardner was one of the most beautiful women God ever created and a lot of times she could get by with that. But when called on to act she could. As Eloise "honeybear" Kelly she's as cynical in her own way as Gable was. They were a perfect fit. This was the last of three films she and Gable made.I don't think Grace Kelly is shown to best advantage here. Her British accent was a bit affected. I'm not sure why MGM just didn't cast a British actress like Deborah Kerr in the part. Of course she also was involved with From Here To Eternity if I remember.Mogambo because of the location shooting and much bigger budget is better than its predecessor Red Dust. For all the unhappiness on the set, the stars and its director did some good work.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid John Ford</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>'Mogambo' is not one of the greatest of John Ford's films, but it is still a solid piece of work. Clark Gable is at his manliest, and Grace Kelly is cast perfectly (though her performance is not so perfect). However, Ava Gardner steals the show. Scenes without her seem dead. Scenes with her are charged with sexy movement and funny double-talk. Of course, Ford himself makes great use of the African landscape, applying his brilliant American West photography to the jungles and rivers of Africa. A good piece of entertainment and recommended for John Ford fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another "safari" in the MGM tradition...Gardner steals the show...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some stunning Technicolor photography of African footage and beautiful AVA GARDNER are the sole reasons for watching John Ford's MOGAMBO, a remake of "Red Dust" that starred Jean Harlow twenty years before this was made.Harlow's co-star, CLARK GABLE, is back reprising his role as the great white hunter (what happened to STEWART GRANGER???), but Gable has mellowed quite a bit and looks a bit too tired to be the love interest of both AVA GARDNER and GRACE KELLY--which is what the plot really boils down to. However, he is more than able to tame both of them.GRACE KELLY still has the affected way of reciting her lines in a prim and princess-like way and is the less interesting of the two females. AVA GARDNER, on the other hand, livens up the story with her sarcastic one-liners and her ability to size up any situation and call a spade a spade. She's honest, frank and completely charming in her own way and walks off with every scene she's in, fully deserving her sole Oscar nomination.But if you're looking for a real good story, MOGAMBO is not it. It has all the realism of a picture postcard despite the fact that much of it was filmed in colorful Africa. But the use of stock footage is also apparent as are shots of Gable and others before a process screen.Fans of the stars should enjoy this one, but be warned--it's not without some serious flaws, mostly due to a weak script.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Technically gorgeous; 8/10</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I think Mogambo may be John Ford's best film technically. The cinematography is simply sumptuous. The colors and the compositions are some of the most beautiful you'll ever see in a film. Too bad it's not in Cinemascope. I would have loved to see those African landscapes in widescreen. The sound is equally deserving of praise. Rare for a classical Hollywood film, Mogambo contains absolutely no extra-diagetic music, i.e., a musical score. The only music comes from a player piano, or African tribes' singing. That singing is just amazing. Most of the background sounds, however, come from African beasts and insects. It provides a threatening mood to the entire film. This experiment pays off wonderfully.Unfortunately, the narrative aspects of the film are lacking. The story, about an adventurer (Clark Gable) who takes a married couple on a safari to study gorillas, is passable. Actually, the meat of the story lies in the budding relationship between Gable and the wife, played by Grace Kelly (perhaps her role in Rear Window, which came out a year later, was inspired by this film). Ava Gardener plays a second love interest, a society girl from NYC, brazen and witty. The problems don't really arise from the plot, but from the characters. They are two-dimensional. Ava Gardener's role is the best, but the script begins to keep her away from the other relationship, which is treated more romantically. Gable's role is too cliche. It's paper thin, and I just never cared much what happened to him. But I think the real problem is with Kelly and her role. Her character changes in wildly unbelievable ways. It's almost as if she falls in love with Gable because, well, that's what women do when Clark Gable's in a movie! It doesn't matter that she's the second one to do so in the first half hour of the film. The film also fails because of the vast amounts of stock footage used to show the wildlife of Africa. Often, this is acceptable. It's obvious that that footage was taken at some other time and with some other type of film than the main footage, but I can suspend my imagination up to a point. However, one particular sequence involving gorillas is rather awful. The party has a face-off with a group of them, and there is a lot of cross-cutting to create suspense. It never works. Especially silly are the shots of Gable standing in front of back-projected stock footage of a bull gorilla charging. I suppose these kinds of shots were impossible to fake anywhere near as well as we can do now. But I still find fault in it. It snapped my suspension bridge.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Gable - still a catch after all those years</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This fifties remake of ?Red Dust' casts Clark Gable again as the man trapped by the attention of two very different women. Instead of Mary Astor we have Grace Kelly as the repressed rich girl, while Jean Harlow's earthy character is portrayed by sensual Ava Gardner, a predatory animal in the hot jungle. The fourth player in the quartet (playing Kelly's husband) is Donald Sinden.Aside from re-setting the action, changing the name of Gable's character, and giving the movie a Technicolor treatment, Mogambo doesn't update the 30s classic that much. Gable is still portrayed as irresistible to women as he was when twenty years younger, and the plot still simmers in the way it did before.Naturally all the stars went on to other interesting things after this ? Gable left MGM to spend his last few years as a lucrative freelance; Kelly had a couple more major roles before marrying into Monaco royalty; and Gardner moved into more mature sexpot roles (such as her similar role opposite Richard Burton in ?The Night of the Iguana' a decade later). Sinden remains best known for his television work but on film he was more than adequate with the more showy co-stars in Mogambo.This movie is not bad at all if you have a couple of hours to spend wondering how the various twists and turns will unfold. </fullReview>

		<fullReview>I love Mogambo, the cinematography is breathtaking, filmed in luscious technicolor and some of the characters are equally as colorful. The cast is headed by Clark Gable, who plays tough trapper Victor Marswell. Joining him is Ava Gardner, on fantastic form as fun-loving Eloise Kelly and her rival for Marswell's affections is Grace Kelly as Linda Nordley, a repressed anthropologist's wife. The banter between Gardner and Gable is superb and there is a chance to see a good performance from Kelly before she became known as Hitchcock's glamorous leading lady.

		<shortDescription>Romantic triangle drama in which the white hunter dallies with an elegant married woman and another with a dark past</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although the original trailer for the film explains that "Mogambo" means "the Greatest," in fact, the word "Mogambo" has no meaning at all . It concerns Victor Marswell (Clark Gable but this lead role was originally intended for Stewart Granger ; Gable also starred in the 1933 original Red Dust by Victor Fleming) runs a big game trapping company in Kenya . Eloise Kelly (glorious charm from Ava Gardner who replaces Jean Harlow , though Deborah Kerr and Lana Turner were sought for the female leads and Maureen O'Hara was the first choice for Honey Bear Kelly) is ditched there , and an immediate attraction happens between them . Victor dallies with the attractive as well as jaded lady Eloise and must let her stay till the next boat arrives . But Victor, initially uninterested, soon succumbs to Eloise's ostentatious charms until the arrival of a marriage , a husband (Donald Sinden) , ill with fevers , and his refined but sensuous wife (Grace Kelly who has Mary Astor's part , though Gene Tierney was first choice for the role of Linda , she dropped out due to emotional problems which were now interfering with her work) . Then , Victor falls to the arms of the sophisticated married woman .This lusty remake deals with classic loving triangle set in Africa and combines love , drama , thrills , action and adventure . Interesting script by John Lee Mahin who reworks his 1932 screenplay for ¨Red Dust¨ . Here we are seeing several African animals though the most turn out to be taken from an excessive utilization of stock-shots , thus : Gnus, Elephants, Impalas , Wild Boar , Gazelle Thomson , lions , Buffalos and Gorillas especially . The film was really censored in some countries , as the censors in Spain did not allow adultery to be shown on the screen. For that reason, MGM changed the relationship of the characters of Linda Nordley (Grace Kelly) and Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden) from wife and husband to sister and brother in the dubbed version released in Spain . However, they did not delete a scene in which both share a bed together. Nice acting by Clark Gable who repeats his character from 1932 , he becomes involved with the new wife of one of his employers . Clark Gable was unimpressed by the script and was wary of reprising his Red Dust (1932) role after 21 years . He only agreed to make the movie after Across the wide Missouri (1951) and Lone Star (1952) both flopped at the box office . Clark Gable and Grace Kelly began an affair on the set that lasted for several months . After filming had ended, they resumed the affair while Kelly was filming The country girl (1954). Ava Gardner steals the show , she is frankly wonderful in the role of the woman with a past . During filming Ava Gardner flew to London to have an abortion after she became pregnant with Frank Sinatra's child . Secondary cast is quite good such as Donald Sinden , Eric Pohlmann , Laurence Naismith and Denis O'Dea .Marvelously shot by two excellent cameramen , Robert Surtees and Freddie Young . Being filmed on location in Mount Kenya, Mount Kilimanjaro, Kenya , Okalataka, Democratic Republic Of Congo , Tanganjika, Tanzania , Serengeti Plain, Tanzania ,Hell's Gate National Park, Kenya , Kagera River ,Uganda ,Thika, Kenya . Despite the high budget, most of the movie was actually filmed in the MGM studio in Hollywood, and especially in MGM British Studios, Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, England, UK . Lavishly produced by the great producer Sam Zimbalist , he came up with the title by altering the name of the Mocambo, a famous Hollywood nightclub . The motion picture was compellingly directed by John Ford , though he did not get along with Clark Gable during filming, and at one point walked off the set in protest at Ford's treatment of Ava Gardner . It's not great John Ford film but results to be worthwhile and enticing .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Remaking RED DUST with it's male star</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>John Ford is usually considered the typical American director at the peak of ability. All his best films remain compelling to this day, although it is the westerns like THE SEARCHERS and MY DARLING CLEMENTINE that are best remembered. But he did a number of films in the last full decade of his work, with various stars. Besides Wayne and James Steward, Ford did films with James Cagney, Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, Tyrone Power, Lee Marvin, Richard Widmark, William Powell, Jack Lemmon, William Holden, Spencer Tracy, Basil Rathbone, and Edward G. Robinson to name just a few. Some of these stars (Robinson and Tracy) worked with him in earlier films). But he was determined to work with Gable, Cagney, Power, and pleased to work with Marvin and Widmark (both of whom made two films with him). Not all of these actors had pleasant times with Ford. He could be a tyrant and vicious with performers (Maureen O'Hara had a bad time with him on THE QUIET MAN - possibly her best film). His antics on MR. ROBERTS led to him being sacked and replaced by Mervyn Leroy. He had wanted to work with Gable for several decades, but Ford worked usually with 20th Century Fox or Republic (and occasionally for RKO and Warners) and rarely for MGM. It was not until 1953 that he and Gable finally got a chance to work together. It was a remake of RED DUST, the film classic that Gable made in 1932 with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor. And, judging from what we know from Ava Gardner's memoirs, it was not a fully happy occasion. The screenplay was changed in many ways. RED DUST was set on a rubber plantation in Malaysia. Gable, twenty one years before, looked like the young, vigorous manager of such a plantation. Now, grayer and slightly grizzled, Gable was a safari leader and animal trapper (for zoos and circuses) in Africa. Gone was that interesting rubber plantation. Also the two women who are fighting for him are not as uneven as Harlow and Mary Astor were in the first film. Harlow was quite obviously a prostitute. While Ava Gardner's Honey Kelly was a good-time girl, she had a history suggesting not so much bordellos but trying to forget a tragic World War II romance. Astor's husband was Gene Raymond, who was trying to work at the plantation as an engineer. Grace Kelly was playing the upper crust wife of scientist Donald Sinden, who was trying to test a theory about gorillas.The presence of so many animals in this version led to some sweet moments (or apparently sweet - Gardner actually did not like working with the animals) especially when she is with the baby elephant. Also there is a sequence where a tribe turns on the local game warden (he's dying when he's talking to Gable, and warning him to leave as quickly as possible), and Gable and the others flee just in time. One wishes more had been made of that sequence, but it was just tangential to the original plot of the story. The use of color film stock is rewarded in this version because of the scenery that is being used.Besides the story's love triangle (or rhomboid - must not forget Sinden and Raymond before that), other characters are repeated. The drunken blabbermouth Donald Crisp is replaced by Eric Pohlmann. The wise old Tully Marshall is now replaced by Philip Stainton. Only the addition of an Irish priest (Dennis O'Dea) is different from the first film.But the snap of the earlier, clever dialog (pushed really well by Jean Harlow's delivery) is missing. It is a good remake, but the original is still better as a film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Exciting jungle adventure, boasting outstanding direction and first-rate performances (especially Ava Gardner's)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In all earnestness, can you imagine a more enjoyable way of spending two hours than journeying through the jungles of Africa with Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, in a film directed by the legendary John Ford? Neither can I, and `Mogambo' does not disappoint.It is a remake of `Red Dust,' a film made by Gable over twenty years earlier, and here (remarkably enough) Clark reprises his role from the first film, with a few small changes. This time around he plays Victor Marswell, a rugged big game hunter and safari leader. Into his African camp comes Gardner, a wisecracking American chorus girl stranded in the jungle and none too happy about it. She and Gable have a brief affair, but the arrival of a British anthropologist and his sheltered wife (Kelly) quickly puts an end to it. Gable agrees to lead the anthropologist on an expedition into gorilla country, and along the way he falls deeply in love with Kelly, and she with him. Gardner, feeling rejected by Gable, first tries to make his life miserable with constant innuendos, but later admits defeat and becomes his ally. In the midst of the gorilla hunt, Gable and Kelly try to find a way to explain their situation to her husband.Their main problem is that the husband is just too likable. He is a decent, good-humored man who loves Kelly dearly and is filled with admiration for Gable, so neither wishes to hurt him. Meanwhile, developments occur in the Gardner character ? she once loved and lost, and is now on the lookout for another man, setting her sights on the macho Gable. She, too, is impossible to dislike, with her sharp wit and ability to size up every situation. She knows where she stands.This is one of the few remakes in Hollywood history to equal, and in my opinion surpass, its predecessor. Of course, this film is not constrained by indoor sets as was the previous one, but there is much more to it than that. `Red Dust' was directed by Victor Fleming, certainly a competent filmmaker, but Ford was a master. He cleverly decided not to use a musical score, but instead to rely on jungle sounds and tribal chants for the soundtrack. Gable is more confident here than before, replacing his earlier smugness with a more mature and hard-bitten performance. Kelly, on the brink of achieving stardom, is rightly prim and proper but still produces a strong, rich characterization.However, the film belongs to Gardner, who admittedly has all the best lines but makes even the mundane ones sound appealing. She lights up every scene she is in, and unfortunately those she is not in are weaker by comparison. Her performance is at once radiant, robust, perceptive and exuberant, and yet somewhat sad. She really gets under the skin of her character and gives arguably the finest performance of her career.The bottom line is that this movie is downright fun. Everyone involved does a top-notch job, and not once does the story drag. It is beautifully photographed in Technicolor, and the animal sequences are exciting and well paced. It's a joy to watch from start to finish, and is highly recommended to all those who love movies. Enough said.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I won't rehash what so many of my fellow reviewers have said about the plot, but I will focus on some of their comments.I found Clark Gable, still handsome and virile, to be too old to be the love interest for Grace's "27 year old" character. I suppose some might feel it worked, but I didn't.I have never been a huge Grace Kelly fan, but she turned in a good performance here. I have no complaints. Her husband in the film was fine too.Ava was the best overall. She seemed very natural and believable. Her sex appeal was transmitted well with her comic flair.I found the first half of the film to be more interesting than when they leave and go on their gorilla expedition.It was an interesting film with luscious Technicolor worth seeing but don't expect too much except for Ava who is the best thing in the film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>It's Ava Gardner's World?and Everyone Else Just Lives in It</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Ava Gardner could hardly be considered anyone's second choice, but this is what director John Ford and screenwriter John Lee Mahin would have you believe in this overripe 1952 safari melodrama. Yet, she is the primary reason why this film is still worth a look 56 years later. Far more intuitively than Angelina Jolie these days, Gardner epitomized a primal sensuality and a hidden vulnerability, the combination of which was intoxicating in her prime. Ford captures this, as well as her dark beauty and sharp comedy sense, by casting her as smart-mouthed, carefree playgirl Eloise "Honey Bear" Kelly, who has come to a remote African outpost to meet up with a wealthy maharajah. Finding herself stood up, she is greeted by no-nonsense big game hunter Victor Marswell as she conveniently takes a shower al fresco. Before sparks can truly fly, a young British anthropologist and his prudish wife, Donald and Linda Nordley, arrive naively drawn to the flora and fauna.Then a rather preposterous story turn occurs in which Marswell becomes smitten with Mrs. Nordley, and she with him since she swoons over the manly hunter over her milquetoast husband. Looking the patrician beauty that served her well during her brief movie career, a 24-year-old Grace Kelly plays Linda in typical melodramatic fashion. Her English accent is a bit overdone, and her character's motivations too simplistically presented for Kelly to shine, especially next to Gardner. As Marswell, the 52-year-old Clark Gable doesn't have quite the swagger he displayed so easily in his youth when he first played this role in 1932's "Red Dust" with Jean Harlow and Mary Astor in the Gardner and Kelly parts. However, it is a testament to his enduring appeal that he is at all convincing as a magnet for two much younger women.But make no mistake that Gable, who has to maintain a stoic, man-of-mystery demeanor as Marswell, really hands the picture to Gardner. In particular, she has a fetching couple of scenes where she sings Robert Burns' "Comin' Through the Rye" and seems truly to enjoy interacting with the wild animals. It's all a hoot, and the location filming in Kenya and Uganda really brings the story to vibrant life. Ford handles the exotic background as well as he does Monument Valley in his classic westerns, and he makes sure to keep goosing the story with action elements so that the focus is not completely on the love triangle. Industry veteran Robert Surtees and David Lean's favorite cameraman Freddie Young shared cinematography responsibilities, and the look of the film is sumptuous even by MGM's high standards. The only extra with the 2006 DVD is the original theatrical trailer.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>O Brother!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In John Ford's "Mogambo", a remake of Victor Fleming's "Red Dust" from 1932, Clark Gable (who also starred in the Fleming film) plays a "great white hunter" ? his character even uses the term, minus the adjective "great", in a disparaging self-description ? who has a thing first for Kelly, a worldly young woman (Ava Gardner) stranded at his safari camp and then, shortly after, falls hard for Mrs. Nordley(Grace Kelly), the wife of one of his safari clients (Donald Sinden).It's rather unusual to find a remake of a film in which the lead is the same as in the original ? Sean Connery in "Thunderball" and "Never Say Never Again" springs to mind, thanks in part to the memorable clue that is the title of the remake - but when it does happen, it's an interesting situation for the viewer. Obviously, comparisons will inevitably occur, so let's clear the big plate off the table right away and agree that "Mogambo", much like "Never Say Never Again", is not as good a film as its original version. At all. The secondary characters are, in general, underdeveloped ? Eric Pohlmann and Philip Stainton are simply clichés ? and, as his would-be primary love interest, Grace Kelly is weak. On the other hand, it is worth watching, particularly if you've seen the earlier film, and not only to see how the legend of Gable, accrued over his career, weighs on that same actor's shoulders in this updated African take on the classic love triangle. Ava Gardner is distracting and light, not the incredible sexual force that Jean Harlow was in the first film, and there's a wonderful sequence involving gorillas that makes all of the rest of the stock footage from wildlife shots look Tarzan-amateur; in fact, the quasi-Tarzan feel that runs through most of the film carries its own irony, given that Gable had apparently been in the running for the role of the Ape Man that Weissmuller landed in 1932.For me, this film is a special treat because of a terrific back-story that my Galician friend told me about it. During the Franco years in Spain, there was heavy censorship of film themes and content, which was often made easier by the practice of dubbing rather than using subtitles. When this film was distributed into Spain, because the idea of adultery was unacceptable to the dictatorship, the theme of "Mogambo" was changed, just a little, in the dubbing. Mrs Nordley, the wife, was quietly and quickly changed, thanks to a few alterations in the dialogue, into Mr. Nordley's sister. Apparently, it was less uncomfortable for the powers in charge to watch scenes ostensibly between a brother and sister that were therefore fraught with incestuous tension than to imagine for a moment that a wife might stray from her marital path.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>for the sake of Ava Gardner only</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>By no means MOGAMBO is among John Ford's best work, nor is Gable or Kelly's, but, it brings Ava Gardner her the one and only Oscar nomination, this reason alone can suffice my curiosity and leapfrog onto the top tier of my watch list. Although the selling point is the African safari its exotic fauna, this film is a standard combo of location shooting and studio imitation, particularly feels ill at ease when the two drastically incompatible part bluntly encounter during the confrontation scenes in the gorilla field, one can feasibly detect actors are acting in front of the footages of the wild creatures, since the qualities of their cinematography are conspicuously inconsistent. We can never catch the vicariousness after all.The storyline is a meandering love triangle with a twist of adultery, Gable is Victor Marswell. a "supposed" charming, middle-aged bachelor and game hunter in Kenya, insouciantly circles around a freewheeling American widow Eloise (Gardner) and a young English wife Linda (Kelly), meanwhile, casually smuggles some wildlife from this primitive land. It is quite awful to watch now, not only because Gable has long passed his crest of his irresistible charisma, but his vocation is innately abhorrent, love is a too precious gift he should not deserve, not to mention from two diametrically disparate belles. Unfortunately this is the philosophy which the Golden Age of Hollywood spoon-fed to its audience (and the picture was a great box office success too). Gable is weathered but unerringly macho, stubbornly guarantees the aesthetics at then. Grace Kelly, soon would win her undeserved Oscar in THE COUNTRY GIRL (1954, 6/10) and reach the zenith of her short but sensational film career with Hitchcock's one-two punch REAR WINDOW (1954, 8/10) and DIAL M FOR MURDER (1954, 8/10) before retreating to be a princess, in here, she also got an Oscar nomination for BEST SUPPORTING ACTRESS, but her character is miserably off-putting, her unreasoning crush on Victor has never been effectively pulled off, although she does fully represent the usual feminine vulnerability to the hilt. Thankfully, Ava Garner is the saving grace in the movie, despite being equally badly materialized as a commodity to men's libido, she strives to be the woman who is decidedly intent on what she wants, most of time, she is stranded in her low tide during the tug-of-love, nevertheless she is perpetually exuberant and fully charged, the time when she feeds the baby elephant and rhinoceros with bananas is priceless, also when a leopard passes by in her tent at night, her response is simultaneously spontaneous and droll. Her presence can validly let viewers forget what a shoddy story it is as long as eventually she is the prize winner. I give the film a generous 6/10 in light of that, albeit all its drawbacks, at the very least it is a coherent star vehicle, and Ava Garner who should be tenderly remembered for her outright beauty and gallantry, even though her entire filmography is not that impressive, she is a one-of- the-kind screen diva who cannot be duplicated in this era.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>after so many years, it seems be testimony about a gorgeous Hollywood age. in fact, it is a splendid film who use African landscapes as scene for a not bad story. sure, Gable is too old for his role and Grace Kelly too delicate, the story is not impeccable but Ava Gardner performance is really admirable. a smart film, like a duel between great actors and a decent script. atmosphere, animals, gallery of nuances explored with grace and talent, humor oasis and a subtle feeling about clash of cultures and ways to discover life. a romance but a special one. maybe for force of Gardner acting. or for the impeccable performance of Kelly but, in same measure, for the science of Gable to use the possibilities of his role.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>what it is and what it is not</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo, 1953, is bound to be compared with Red Dust, 1932. The two films are based on the same stage play by Wilson Collison; the same man, John Lee Mahin, wrote both screenplays, some of the lines are even the same; the three main characters and the love triangle (or quadrangle) they form is the same; the leading man is played by the same actor, Clark Gable; and if you saw the first film, then you already know the "bang-up" ending.Many people will find the later film the weaker of the two, but I believe that if it is viewed for what it is, instead of for what it is not, it is not bad value for money. What made Red Dust a winner was Jean Harlow, her snappy witty lines, and the sweaty sensuality of the screen chemistry between her and Gable. That is what Mogambo is not; but it has a number of other things to offer instead. While most of the secondary characters in Red Dust, including the character of the adulterous wife (originally played by Mary Astor), are cast into the shadows by the sizzling repartee between Harlow and Gable, Mogambo allows the corresponding characters to develop and show some depth. In Mogambo, the motivations and inner conflicts of the adulterous wife (now played by Grace Kelly) are explored. The sappy jilted husband is given a great deal more depth in the later film than in the earlier one. And Gable's right-hand man, Brownie, is given a more substantial part as well. This makes the later film more rounded and the characters more believable, whereas the earlier film was basically a stage duel between the barbarian and the hooker. Red Dust has a sort of Who's-Afraid-of-Virginia-Woolf claustrophobia about it; it could have been entirely played out on a single indoor stage set. Mogambo features John Ford's typical outdoorsy-ness, some pretty spectacular wildlife photography (for 1950), and a rather tense confrontation with a tribe of angry, bare-breasted, spear-wielding natives (real Africans!). Not Ford's or Gable's best by any means, but a good solid show, worth 7 out of 10.Gable plays the same boorish, over-confident, God's-gift-to-women type in both films, but mellowed a bit (like wine, I mean). Whether you like that kind of man or not, you have to admit that he played it with grace and poise, and he showed that he could still do it 20 years on. The Gable character has been criticized by other reviewers for being incoherent or sappy. I disagree: he shows himself to be a man of raw courage, facing down wild animals, a savage tribe, a storm, etc., but finds he has lost his nerve when it comes to confronting the wimpy clueless husband. It takes Gardner to show him it wasn't cowardice, but that he did the decent thing after all.Grace Kelly takes over the role of the adulterous wife, a mere 27 years old (so we are told) and very naive; it takes Gable's experience, wisdom, and bluntness to make her see that she does not love her husband, whom she has known since she was five. Her performance has been criticized as confused and incoherent, and Gable too old to be attractive to her; but I can well believe that a sheltered girl who married her childhood-love would be pretty confused and dotty after the first 'real man' she had ever met had heroically saved her life twice in one week. Her distress and confusion are well played, and she screams well when confronted by a panther.Ava Gardner--well, what can one say that hasn't been already? The scene in which Gardner darts into the tribal missionary church and genuflects while the rest of the safari party go on about their business, gives her character an unexpected dimension the Harlow character lacked. I think it shows grand professionalism on Gable's part that he apparently quite happily let Gardner steal scene after scene. I guess Gable didn't have to prove anything to anyone anymore.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Mogambo. What can I say?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>As I'm sure you have all read, this is supposed to be an excellent re-make of "Red dust" which was shot on a set in Hollywood and Clark Gable was in his early 30's. Also, "Red dust" had Jean Harlow and Mary Astor, both excellent and beautiful women I guess it is a remake in the sense that the story is almost exactly the same. However, this film was made by John Ford and he was a master of film-making. We feel like we are there in the lush jungle, humid and glorious. Just like all of his western films: hot, dry and dusty. At first, I didn't think I would like this movie, but as was also stated by others, Ava Gardener is one hellua great actress. Grace Kelly plays the perfect bored, married, upright, uptight woman and she plays perfectly off Ava Gardner I love Ava Gardner, and Grace Kelly. Of course Clark Gable was one of the greatest actors of all time. No one compares to him today. I wish they could be as good as the actors from that era. I wish actors would take notes from the fine actors of the early days of film. They would probably learn many things. Not having the luck to have been born when these actors were at their prime, I look around and I don't think there is an actress/actor today that can hold a candle to either one of the two women in this film. Seems like the actors of today could do themselves a favor by watching these women and learning from them. Maybe stay out of the tabloids, keep their lives private. Don't say it can't be done, Jody Foster has kept out of the press for years and she is one of the finest actors of this era. I only say these things because I love films and would love to see some films out now that I would want to see. I am happy we had a theatre nearby so we could watch the old films for $1.00. That was last year. They just raised the price to $2.00 and the price is worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Gable reprises his role from "Red Dust" twenty years earlier in this remake by Ford. He is a third of a love triangle completed by Gardner and Kelly. It's a little hard to buy the concept of both women lusting after Gable because he looks older than both of them combined! The stars are fun to watch, with Gardner giving the best performance. It's entertaining enough although there isn't much of a plot and it goes on too long. The location cinematography by Surtees and Young is quite beautiful. This would make a nice double-bill with Hawks' "Hatari," which has a similar setting and plot, including a May-December romance involving John Wayne.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ignore the story, just look at the stars, the sky, the animals........</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo is the remake of Gable's old film "Red Dust" (1932)), with pretty much the same plot, new ladies to fall at the hem of his khaki shorts, and a new backdrop - the dark continent.This is a "silent" MGM movie, other than the native African chanting and songs, there are no soundtracks. A very welcoming surprise for me, as I sometimes find MGM soundtracks just about as attractive as Wagner blasting away on bad stereo when you are trying to sleep - they DO overkill so....John Ford did a beautiful job presenting Africa in the 50's. His cinematography of the landscape/animals and take on the locals are broad and quite superficial if you compare it to "Out of Africa". But then - these are just backdrops to the stars - Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly.Ava Gardner did one of her best acting in this film. The street-wise "Honey Bear", with an ambiguous past and acid sense of humour, fits her to the T. Clark Gable is just his usual self - adequate, but I was expecting something more as this is his second time. I must say I was disappointed.Another disappointment comes from the unbalanced love triangle - one simply cannot see why Victor would be attracted to Linda, much less the opposite. And with the script heavily in favour of Eloise, why Grace Kelly would agree to play Linda Nordley is completely beyond me. Compare to Gardener's feisty, friendly Eloise, Kelly's Linda is uptight, neurotic, and a perfect snub. Linda's high-pitched voice and prim-and-proper mannerism looked oddly out of place in a safari camp. And the fact that she made little effort to disguise her lack of interest in her husband's work shows lack of affection for the man she is married to - thus making her "instant love" for a man she had thought of as vulgar couple days ago rather inconceivable.On the other hand, Eloise is shown helping the natives with chores, goofing around with the animals, socialising with Victor's crew and learning to live his safari life with a nomad's ease. One cannot help by wonder what could Victor possibly see in Linda and couldn't wait for him to break the affair off.Mogambo's script is the perfect example of studio "factory" work, with good bits by good writers, bad bits by bad ones. It is painfully obvious the writer who wrote that the Eloise/Victor scenes is better than the one who wrote the ending. Yes, it's not just any man, it's Gable.......but it is just out of character for Eloise to agree to marry Victor knowing that he's still in love with Linda. No woman is THAT open-minded, no even for Gable!</fullReview>

Okay that's the most interesting thing about this film . Otherwise it could have been set anywhere as what it amounts to is a love triangle and hard to believe one at that. Sure Gable is cool, but I can't imagine either of these beauties (Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner) falling for him. Great performance from Ava though, reminded me a lot of her in "Night of the Iguana" and from what I've read of her life it is very close to her true character. Grace Kelly is a great beauty no doubt, but is there anyone else out there who feels, like me, that her voice with that fake English accent is annoying?</fullReview>

Clark Gable is his reliable he-man self. Ava Gardner is great as Honey Bear. She exudes charm, sex, comic relief and a sad/happy characterzation. Grace Kelly became a star after this and she does fine. An underrated Donald Sinden is excellent as Ms. Kellys husband. Too bad in a good scene with Gable, he's given short shift as the camera is on Gable for close-ups or in the two shot Gable is up-stage of Sinden throughout. Well, Clark WAS the star. Too bad for too much rear projection. The fact that the ladies look so clean, neat and have so many costume changes out there in the bush is quite incredible. Today they would have filmed it more realistically and of course the love scenes would be quite blatant.</fullReview>

Aided by wonderful cinematography and direction, you really feel as though you too are on location with them. So many snappy quotes - mainly from Eloise Kelly -"Look, Mr whoever you are, let me jump to my own conclusions!", "Look, buster, don't you get overstimulated with me!", "Everything snarls around this joint!" and (referring to wine) "Any year, any model, they all bring out my better nature" to name but a few.

		<shortDescription>The humor, drama, and vision of "Africa" are all painfully out of date</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo (1953)I can't look at a movie like this without asking who is in control, who is being abused, who is plundering, and why does the movie not talk about these discrepancies of power? African Queen, made just two years earlier, faces the same problem from a different direction, narrowing our view to the changing of two archetypes toward mutual understanding, largely avoiding the cultural problem. In Mogambo, the movie expands outward, with decreasing interest and believability. Yes, it has to be said, there are some stunning wildlife scenes, and some genuine (and valuable) indigenous singing and shots of tribal Africans on location. The film was largely shot in Africa, and it feels authentic in that way, a long way from earlier versions shot on a Hollywood lot.But Mogambo, a remake of the better "Red Dust," is a kind of embarrassingly bad movie in other ways. There's just no getting around the poorly developed characters, the almost non-existent "plot" (nothing much happens) and even the unconvincing romances, which should have won me over since I'm a sucker. John Ford is famously a masculine director, just as was John Huston ("African Queen"), and Ford became famous for making movies about the changing of one world order for another--the American Western. In a weird, simplistic way, this is another Western, with outsiders improbably facing strange territory and hostility, and with everyone misunderstanding at least something that leads them astray. The starring actor makes it worthwhile, for those of us who admire him, Clark Gable. Grace Kelly also appears, but as usual is largely ornamental and too ivory to advance the plot.Ava Gardner is whole other problem. She's full of life but has a miserable script to read from, and is made to be a caricature of a ditzy New York woman in wild Africa. Well, Ford "fleshes" her out in his own way, but Gable is more respectful, as usual. Either way, her performance ends up crippling some of the authenticity of the rest of it. She does have a fearless and quaint way with the animals (and the baby elephants in particular are super cute). In fact, if animal rights concern you, you might have trouble with all the trapped, hunted, and caged wildlife. Seen from 2010, this is a revealing and disturbing and frivolous, white colonialist's view of Africa. If you aren't distracted by the glib Gardner and the artificial Kelly, or by the attempts to be humorous, and to set the two woman against each other (one proper, in a dress, the other less so, in pants), you'll see some interesting footage. Intermittent footage is not my idea of a good movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Three great stars go to Africa and nothing much happens</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly are of course Hollywood legends. Unfortunately Mogambo proves that you can throw three Hollywood legends together, and even give them a legendary director too in John Ford, and still end up with a disappointing movie. It's interesting to see these three great stars together but once you get past the undeniable star power there's not much there in Mogambo. The movie looks great, it's a beautifully shot time capsule look at 1950s Africa. However while it may work as an African travelogue of sorts it never really works as a movie. There's just not enough entertainment value here, not enough of a story to really engage the audience. If the movie featured a cast of no-names it would have long since been forgotten. But the big stars on display make the movie, if not ultimately satisfying, at least noteworthy.Mogambo's paper-thin plot centers around Gable's character of Victor Marswell, who works in an exceptionally remote African outpost capturing animals and selling them on to zoos for large profit. He doesn't need distractions but distraction arrives on his doorstep one day in the person of Honey Bear Kelly, played by Gardner. She doesn't belong there, is hopelessly out of place, and will be on the first boat out. But in the days before that boat arrives she and Marswell kind of fall for one another. However when the boat arrives Marswell is ready to bid Honey Bear adieu and move on to the next pretty young thing. That would be Linda Nordley, young and exceedingly beautiful wife of rather oblivious scientist Donald who has hired Marswell to take him on safari. The Nordleys arrive. Honey Bear departs but only briefly. She'll be back before you know it and the romantic entanglements ensue.This love triangle (or rectangle I suppose if you include hapless Donald) is basically it as far as story goes in Mogambo. And it's not enough to really sustain things. You never get the sense there's any great drama. Our key characters, in addition to having to deal with the romantic permutations, are also threatened by wild animals and, in at least one instance, by some rather ticked-off native folk. But for whatever reason things always seem rather mundane. Matters are not helped by the fact that two of the three big stars are not in peak form. By this point in his career Clark Gable was probably a little old for this sort of thing. It had been fourteen long years since Rhett Butler and the years show. Watching this guy in his early fifties sweep any young beauty he chooses off her feet strains credulity a bit. And while Gable is perhaps a little too experienced Grace Kelly, in playing Linda Nordley, is maybe not experienced enough. It was only Kelly's second big role and she comes across a bit stiff and unnatural. Her manner of speaking doesn't fit, it's like she's putting on airs. Basically she acts like a princess. Ironic I know. It's Ava Gardner who comes across best. What life the movie has mostly comes from her portrayal of Honey Bear. She's excellent but most of what surrounds her does not rise to her level. Mogambo ends up being a good-looking picture which ultimately fails to entertain. Enjoy the scenery. Enjoy the animals. Where else will you see pineapple-eating gorillas? But sadly the story is not nearly as good as the visuals.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a remake of "Red Dust" from the 1930s and Clark Gable plays the same role -- the white professional guide through the African jungle who also collects animals for zoos and circuses. He's hired by a naive anthropologist and his wife, Kelly, to take them into the bush and shoot movies of gorillas and trap a baby gorilla to study back home.Gable's dalliance with tough but good-natured Ava Gardner is interrupted but he doesn't mind, once he gets an eyeful of the delicate blond Grace Kelly. She's overwhelmed by the cloud of pheromones that follows Gable about and he, in turn, decides that this time it's for keeps.But then there's that awkward business of letting the wimpy husband in on their plans. And that noisome Ava Gardner is always hanging around, all knowingly, making wisecracks about the new love affair. I mean, it gets racy too. Their truck passes a male elephant who trumpets and uncurls his trunk straight out into the air. "Reminds me of somebody I know," cracks Gardener.In the end, Gable comes to his senses, tricks Kelly into loathing him, and marries the woman he was truly meant to be with, the one who is as resilient and durable as he is.It wasn't an easy shoot. Director Ford was beginning to feel his age. Gable insisted on going off to hunt big game. Ford thought it was dangerous and stupid. Frank Sinatra, married to Ava Gardner at the time, showed up on location and everyone expected him to act like the Chairman of the Board -- "Here, pal, here's fifty; go take a hike." Instead, at Ford's request, he was put to use making spaghetti for the crew. Gable had been through much tribulation since "Red Dust", twenty years earlier, and had begun drinking, but he'd help up well, considering.Grace Kelly should have been right for the part of the naive young wife. She looks appealing enough and seems frangible, as if anyone could break one of her long bones just be pressing it too hard, but she's allowed to overact. Ava Gardner never looked more attractive or sexier. Jean Harlow brought a note of stronger vulgarity to the role. Gardner seems a little too nice, despite the acidulous dialog.The movie is entertaining and colorful but seems oddly dated. Every movie about Africa is compelled to give us shots of African animals that, I suppose, a hundred years earlier were still novel. Yes, that's a cheetah, alright. We saw a National Geographic Special about cheetahs just last week. Fastest mammals on earth, y'know? They're no longer gape worthy. They have to play some part in the story if we're going to pay attention any longer.And I don't know why people don't leave gorillas and other primates alone. There aren't that many of them left. We're destroying them through habitat destruction and poaching. Why would anyone want to point a high-powered rifle at a great ape and shoot it dead? They don't do anything but eat fruit and vegetables. I wonder if humans might have more compassion for gorillas if they saw them naked and shaved, as I did when I studied comparative primatology. The male appendage is positively tiny compared to ours. Well, that probably wouldn't make us pause before killing them anyway. We'll stop when there are no more left.Anyway, it's a satisfying movie that ought to interest the family, assuming the kids don't grasp the symbolic significance of elephant trunks. "Red Dust" -- studio-bound as it is -- is still better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Mogambo," meaning "the greatest" in the African local language, is actually Clark Gable himself. It is surprising that Gable performed the same role in both "Red Dust" (1932) and its remake "Mogambo" (1953) with the 21 year old difference, but I can understand only Gable can play such a part. The story is about an entrepreneur hunter (Gable) and his romance with two beautiful women (Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly), but the director, John Ford never forgot to tactfully incorporate great sceneries and wild animals in Africa. You will watch the film without being bored till the end. Ava Gardner, the IMDb commenting "many fans still consider her the most beautiful actress in Hollywood history" in her mini-biography, is attractive, playing a part most suitable to her, and Grace Kelly is performing well the emotion uncomfortable in the wild life and snubbing her rival woman. Never miss this!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a title! When I learned that "Mogambo" meant 'passion' in Swahili, the translation was so satisfying I didn't even want to check.And yes indeed, "Mogambo" is one of the hottest and most sensual adventure-films from Hollywood's Golden Age, and if some movie buffs refer to it as that John Ford's film (or remake, for the experts) set in Africa, I can't see it otherwise than the film with perhaps the best love triangle ever, Clark Gable, Ava Gardner and Grace Kelly, all of them in the American Film Institute's Top 50 Movie Legends? and what I love the most about that awkward tale of ambiguous love is the conclusion. You got it, I'm a fan of Ava Gardner.Ava Gardner was once named the 'most beautiful animal' and "Mogambo" sweeps off any derogatory undertone from that nickname for there is something magnetically bestial in the attraction that woman exudes, from her feline temper to her voluptuous curves, there's no way not to look at Ava Gardner as the ultimate incarnation of forbidden delights, especially since she never acts as if she was aware of that power, she's natural, earthy, sincere, she's what you can call a 'woman's man's woman'. So, it is only fitting that the man she falls in love with is a tough and virile game hunter played by Clark Gable, the ultimate macho icon, the one who's stronger, taller, bigger, gentler, funnier than any other man in the surrounding cast.And it's only fitting that the theater of their romance is the African wildlife, perhaps the only setting to give a warm welcome to that beautiful 'animal' ? and reciprocally, Ava sure has a way with them animals? from playful baby elephants to towering giraffes. Besides, the setting of the African country gives a whole other dimension to the chemistry going between good old Victor and good old Kelly (that's their names), it is not to just about sending flowers and playing serenades, it's the good old 'rumble in the jungle', the "you Clark, me Ava", the game that plays between all the animals and make the strongest one get the girl.At one moment, she gets in his arms, scared by good old Joe, the name of Victor's pet snake, but savoring that tender moment on his torso, she concedes that a man like Victor wouldn't need old Joe to get a girl in his arms. If there's no sexual innuendo behind that, then I haven't seen enough movies in my life. But still, this would be too easy, if Kelly and Victor were alone on that safari, no sir, in the animal world, it's all about earning your love, like two hippos fighting to get the female. But in the case of "Mogambo", it's two girls who fight for good old Gable, and the second one is the perfect match for the volcanic brunette, it's the classy blonde. And both were so invested they earned the two only Oscar nominations of the film.Grace Kelly is Linda Nordsley, the wife of Donald (Donald Sunden), an anthropologist who came to film gorillas, he's given the lousiest role as the cuckolded husband who can't see his woman fooling around. But this is Grace Kelly we're speaking of, and although she does fall in love with Gable and that love is mutual, we'll never cast the stone on her. Gable dwarfs any man in comparison, and being the king of the jungle, the wildlife expert and the most competent hunter to protect the weak female, all the knowledge, all the kindness in the world wouldn't compete with that.It all ends up with Gardner as Kelly becoming her greatest rival, she's in love with Victor because she's an earthy straight-forward woman, like him, and Linda loves him because he completes her. I'm not sure whether we're supposed to be similar or complementary, but I felt so sorry for Donald that I wished Linda wouldn't end up as Victor's trophy hunt from the safari, and what made me love Victor is that he felt guilty about it, too. And this leads to perhaps the greatest conclusion ever, precisely for its anticlimactic effect, Gable wants to get rid of Linda for her own good, so he gives her the best slap in the face since the D-word to Vivien Leigh, and if Grace Kelly can get away by being an unfaithful wife, Gable can get away with being rude with a woman.That was as perfect a conclusion as it could ever get ? because the passion, the 'mogambo' thing the film is about, is that fluid going between Gable and Gardner, perfect for each other. They love nature, animal, tropical setting, because they got it in their veins, they're travelers, adventuring from place to place, heart to heart, until finding themselves through one's heart, in a way, they were their own trophy hunt. And somewhat, you can feel the Fordesque touch, Gable is to the jungle what Wayne is to Silicon Valley, and if a man like Victor had to end with a princess like Linda, well as Wayne would say, "that'll be the day".Now, of course, it would be easy to discuss of all the colonial, borderline racist, elements dating the film, and I concede there are several, but this film is about escapism, it provides some of the greatest shots of African wildlife and in its own way, can be seen as a perfect documentary matching the quality of National geographic, not that it was intended, but the film has a pedagogical value and for that, Ford deserves credit.So it's irrelevant to discuss about racism because the film is like a Vaudeville in Safari-land, with so much fun that it's clear it doesn't take itself seriously, it's all about the burning passion between three of the era's hottest stars in the world's hottest place, making "Mogambo" the hottest thing Hollywood Golden Age could ever express.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Natives Are Restless, Bwana--And You Will Be, Too!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Western director John Ford was more or less asleep at the wheel on this jungle epic, with the stars given a tepid script rife with fifties clichés about the roles men and women play in the moral scheme of things. Gable had done the same role some 20 years earlier in the hugely entertaining, zippy precode Red Dust with sassy Jean Harlow and salty Mary Astor, but Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner, while holding their own in the beauty department, are given next to nothing to work with, except perhaps for Ava's tussle in the mud with a baby elephant. Gable goes through the motions of being The Great White Hunter with his customary professionalism, but looks fairly bored. The idea of hunting down and killing gorillas is certainly as outmoded today as the romantic clichés--but there is some excellent footage of native African dances and some nice scenery,though nothing one can't see to more advantage in a National Geographicspecial. Recommended only for star fans as Saturday matinée material.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One answer to TV</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo stars Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly. In the early 1950s, Hollywood was trying to find some formula to get people out of their living rooms watching TV and back to the theater, so took their top stars to Africa on safari. That'll show those upstarts! This was a big hit and is one of the better uses of the great grasslands, and uplands, of Africa and the animals who live there. The gorilla scenes are marvelous too, but the attitude that shooting animals and/or catching them for display in zoos, is backward. Gardner steals the film from goody two shoes Grace. Grace may have gotten a prince in real life, but Ava got 'The King' of films in this movie and, according to bios, in real life. There is no music score. Only the chants and sounds of Africa. So effective and one of the first films to use the system. Remake of Red Dust which also starred Gable with the blond bombshell - Jean Harlow. Earlier film was fun, but this safari does it for me. 8/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though originals usually tower over remakes, I prefer "Mogambo" to "Red Dust." It's true that Clark Gable reprises his role from the earlier film, but the years between the two movies are evident on his face, and that makes all the difference. In "Dust," he was a jaunty young adventurer on the make. Here he's a graying outdoorsman with an exciting past and probably not much future. The two beautiful women half his age are attracted to him less for his manly vitality than for the romantic world he represents. (There's a parallel to Gable himself, who in his youth advanced his career by courting older women, then in middle age became the unattainable idol of star-struck young girls.) What a colorful, spectacular world this is -- Africa before its wildlife was devastated. And Grace Kelly and Ava Gardner, though very different in looks, are both at the peak of their gorgeousness. This is juicy escapism that would be fun to watch even with the sound off.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Picture</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This color remake of Red Dust is great entertainment. With real Star Power of Gable, Gardner, and Kelly, as well as a fine supporting cast, this a fast-moving (well, maybe NOT today's version of fast moving) tale of love, lust and repression on safari in Africa. The director is the legendary John Ford who knows how to handle these things and keep the plot moving. Mogambo is aided immeasurably by the fact that it was filmed on location and, to these eyes,looks like most of the picture is 'on location' except of course for the interiors and a few other scenes. One doesn't really notice the changes that much as Ford's visual eye captures the wide open spaces and the abundant wild-life that abounds in it.Ava Gardner gives one of her most vibrant performances on screen with a healthy dose of wise cracks and chemistry - especially with Gable who also gives off some of the electricity that he didn't always show in his 50's movies. (But then, he patented the role in Red Dust 20 years earlier. BTW, that film should be checked out too - it's the same, but different) It should also be noted that Grace Kelly, early in her career gives one of her better performances. So with solid support from the minor players, good script, fine direction and great scenery, this one shouldn't be missed by Classic Film fans.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Big stars and big game make this very watchable</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This entertaining hokum is a remake of the 1932 Red Dust, with Clark Gable reprising his "great white hunter" role. It's a rather unusual movie for John Ford, and one wonders whether he was influenced by the fact that John Huston had made African Queen a couple of years earlier. Certainly, Mogambo has just as much local colour as that movie, with hordes of native Africans performing dances and shaking spears; and herds of animals, including some remarkable footage of gorillas. The plot has the gorgeous Ava Gardner as a good time girl fetching up at Gable's safari camp and having a fling with him, before he unaccountably allows himself to be attracted by a typically cut-glass Grace Kelly, who is married to a dull but decent amateur naturalist played by Donald Sinden at his most English. After some nice shots of Gable and Kelly embracing against flaming sunsets, and a penultimate scene - rather in the manner of Howard Hawks - where Gardner proves that she is just one of the boys, she and Gable get together, as we knew they would all along.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"Like I've always said, Kelly, you're all right"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I only wanted to see this movie for two reasons: 1. the most charming, breathtaking, incredible Clark Gable 2. because I know how everybody says Red Dust is a really good film (which I didn't find anywhere, so I didn't have the opportunity to see it), and I knew Mogambo is its remake, so I thought I'd give it a try, to see if I like it.To my surprise, I really did like it, and a lot. And it was not only and not particularly because of Clark Gable. Before seeing it, I figured I'd just focus exclusively on Gable, that is, if I didn't like the movie. But it was not the case. After 15 minutes of Mogambo, all my attention was drawn to Ava Gardner, and it stayed on her during the whole movie. Like other people also wrote, the scenes without her were rather dull, and the ones with her were suddenly full of life. I was constantly looking forward to seeing her again. I must say that this was the first movie starring Ava Gardner that I ever saw, so that's the reason for my enthusiasm. It is also my first Grace Kelly movie, and she left me somewhat indifferent. Maybe that is because I didn't like her character at all. I mean, I was kind of angry at Clark Gable's character, Victor Marswell, because he had let go such a fine, enchanting woman like Kelly for the gentle, kind, humble, but not so interesting Linda. This is another point I would like to make: all three main actors acted very well, since I really felt Kelly's huge jealousy, Victor's inclination and growing fondness for Linda, and Linda's both love for Victor, and fear,shame for cheating on her husband.I found the end a bit confusing, or disappointing, so that's the part that prevents me from giving the movie 9.5 or 10. Also, although the cinematography was beautiful, the colors exquisite, the landscapes breathtaking and all that, I was pretty annoyed by the fact that at times, you could really see that many scenes were taken from documentaries, and not filmed for the movie. Apart from that, I'll remember this movie for the beautiful Ava Gardner, and the manliest man of all, Clark Gable, who seemed to rob more and more hearts as he was aging.9/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>No "Red Dust"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Clark Gable stars in the remake of a film he did in the '30s, "Red Dust," now called "Mogambo." Gable plays Vic, a big game capturer this time (last time he made rubber) who sells animals to zoos and circuses. Already I was turned off. He meets a young woman, "Honeybear" (Ava Gardner), who is as tough and streetwise as he is. When Donald and Linda Nordley appear to go on safari so they can study gorillas, Vic falls for Linda (Grace Kelly).This film was done on location in Africa, so there are some unbelievable scenes with animals and with African tribes speaking their language and going through their rituals. At a down period in his career, Frank Sinatra was in Africa with Ava waiting on his screen test for "From Here to Eternity," which he got thanks to Ava's appeal to Mrs. Harry Cohn. I'm sure his presence did not contribute to a fun time on the set. When he got the role and didn't need Ava to hold his hand anymore, he left.You can probably enjoy this film a) if you don't compare it to "Red Dust," and b) if you don't care about seeing animals trapped in nets. It didn't look all that humane to me, and I found it distasteful. Ava Gardner has the Jean Harlow role in "Red Dust" and makes it her own. She is less funny than Harlow was; Harlow was more childlike and overtly sexual. Ava is beautiful as always and very earthy, and in her way is as good with Gable as Harlow. Honeybear is the most likable and best drawn character in "Mogambo." Gable is 20 years older than his first time around but still darn attractive and sexy. Which brings me to the real problem I have which is Grace Kelly. There is no unearthly reason why Vic would have been attracted to the staid and priggish Linda. Kelly is not particularly good. Yes, she's beautiful but her bright overenthusiasm doesn't play. I actually didn't get Gable's attraction to Mary Astor either, but she was much more believable in the role."Mogambo" doesn't have the spunk of "Red Dust" but shot in color and on location in Africa, it's watchable with the above caveats.</fullReview>

Not much. They hung around camp, talked, talked, and talked some more. Ava decides to take a walk...not a good idea considering where they are....he has to go save her, etc.A lot of people have concerns about how the animals were treated, the implicit racism etc. but you have to remember, this was made in 1953. You can't really judge what when on in 1953 but 2011 standards. People still try though.Eh I don't know what else to write about the movie...because to me...there was nothing there.Sadly disappointed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Clark Gable plays a rough wildlife hunter, who captures wild animals for zoos and takes frivolous wealthy scientists on safari. The improbable story involves a lot of hand-wringing scenes with chatty, emotional women in immaculately pressed, cute outfits throughout hot, dusty, steamy Africa. The supporting cast is mostly dull and the plot...thin at best. The whole scene serves as a scaffold off of which the studio tries to hang a cat fight between two fabulous, yet totally dissimilar women, over the marginally sexy Clark Gable. Save yourself some time and grief: scan forward to the last half hour of the film and you'll see the best performances,figure out the whole story, and watch the rapid wind-up. Ava Gardner looks the quintessential 50's good-time girl. Grace Kelley works the nice-girls-need-love too angle with aplomb. The one thing that makes the film worth a look is the many scenes of Africa and the real tribesmen in their beautiful and interesting native clothes and adornments. African singing throughout. Warning: Politically incorrect conversations about taking baby gorillas away for profit. And holy smokes! For fun, Count the number of cigarettes doled out and in this film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In picturesque Africa, rugged animal hunter Clark Gable (as Victor "Vic" Marswell) is annoyed to discover alluring Ava Gardner (as Eloise "Honey Bear" Kelly) has undressed and made herself comfortable at his jungle ranch. He is hot under the collar, but she is hot under her robe. After nature takes its course, Ms. Gardner is surprisingly sent packing ? you see, Mr. Gable is not the marrying kind. Thanks to a shipwreck, Gardner returns. This wouldn't be worth watching without her. Also arriving is prim and pretty Grace Kelly (as Linda Nordley), the wife of a British anthropologist who wants to hunt gorilla with Gable. Although she pretends to be happily married, Ms. Kelly comes between Gable and Gardner...Gone are the days when you could see a movie like this ? so much about sex, but showing so little sex. The story is even tamer than the original "Red Dust" (1932), which also starred Gable. All of this serves to make "Mogambo" more interesting. Now firmly in his 50s, Gable is still an attractive and appealing leading man. Kelly certainly holds her own against MGM's big man and their sexy co-star. Reportedly, director John Ford was unhappy with the film and his leading players. However, it is plainly obvious how his cameras favor Gardner in all of her glory. Note, for example, how she is filmed getting off the lifeboat. If you've ever wondered what the fuss about Ava Gardner was all about, look here.****** Mogambo (9/23/53) John Ford ~ Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly, Donald Sinden</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>works not as a love triangle, but as something else</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've never seen "Red Dust", of which John Ford's "Mogambo" is a remake, so I can't compare the two. What I can say is that not enough happens in "Mogambo" to make it anything more than an average love triangle story. The movie deserves analysis for another reason. This story of a group of people on safari in central Africa came out around the time that many of the African countries started gaining independence, along with other former colonies in Asia. The new presence of countries with non-white populations forced a reevaluation of the world for the majority-white countries. For years, Europeans and Americans had simply viewed Africa as the "dark continent", but now a collection of people from the United States and England are walking through it, even making occasional contact with the native peoples. Of course, the treatment of this is still a little bit backwards, and I suspect that these tourists might come across as the stereotype of the ugly American.Basically, the movie works better if you view it not in terms of its plot, but as a look at the forced new view of the world. Otherwise, it comes across as the sort of movie that they made just because they could.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ironic in its setup.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It has a top-notch director and three of the biggest Hollywood stars in its billing. Yet, there is something about Mogambo that did not appeal to me and after it was over I felt as if I had been cheated in some way. Perhaps it was due to the fact that these three actors are not allowed to work with one another.The setup is typical of most Clark Gable films: he is a rugged big-game hunter in Africa who immediately attracts the eye of an entertainer named Honey Bear (Ava Gardner). By some contrived notions, she manages to stay in this jungle which certainly doesn't suit her normal lifestyle, and soon she is having a fling with big, bad Vic Marswell (Gable). However, along comes a young anthropologist and his beautiful English wife (Grace Kelly). For some reason not specifically mentioned, Marswell and the wife begin to have feelings for one another. Of course, this throws the entire safari party into whack and turns into a bit of melodramatic insanity.This is certainly not a bad film. The cinematography is typical Ford images of the landscape and sunsets, except here it captures the beauty of the jungles and deserts of Africa and it is a sight. However, I found none of the lead actors to be very likable, particularly Gable who seems to be purposely trying to break up a marriage, only to occasionally fall back onto the single Gardner. Gardner does give the best performance, but all her double-talk and suggestive dialog seems to fall flat, but perhaps that was the point. Grace Kelly is beautiful and refined, but a bit stuffy to be sympathetic towards or even really care about at all. This is most ironic, because I am sure that the studio intended for audiences to flock to this film due to the three big names. For me though, they didn't bring the magic. As I said before, it isn't a bad film but I think Ford and these three could have done way better.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>For a movie that advertises itself as an adventure movie this movie surely has few thrills and action in it. The movie instead is a typical multiple way love-story, that still works out good and interesting thanks to its settings.The movie its romantic story is pretty well written and works out just fine because of the unusual settings and top-class actors in this movie. The script avoids a couple of clichés, though it's still an obvious typical romantic '40's/'50's movie love-story.But yeah, the movie is definitely a lackluster. Some action really wouldn't had harmed this movie. It would at least had provided the movie with some more pace to overcome the more slower and dull moments within the movie.The movie has an overall nice atmosphere and it was mostly shot on location throughout Africa, though some pickup shots are obvious studio work. It also helps that the movie uses lots of locals for roles in the movie and nature shots of animals, even though they were clearly separately shot from the rest of the movie.There are some fine actors in this movie but I didn't always liked the characters. This especially goes for the Grace Kelly character. She seems to be irritated with everyone and everything. Also with her own husband, who seems to have done nothing wrong in his life to her. It makes her character one that is hard to really sympathize for and one that perhaps even annoys at points. Nevertheless, Grace Kelly still received an Oscar nominations for her performance. The same goes for Ava Gardner by the way. I liked her role and character on the other hand by the way.Clark Gable didn't really seemed right and believable in his role as the tough ladies-man. He really didn't aged well and his glory days were long behind him, with of course the '30's and his "Gone With the Wind" role as his ultimate career highlights. He looked too old and fragile for the kind of role as in this movie. Clark Gable unfortunately only lived to the age of 59 before dying of a heart attack, which really didn't surprised me that much if you see him in his later movies, such as this one. So perhaps he was a bit miscast in this movie, although it's understandable. His name of course really sells when its attached to a movie and he played some good similar type of roles in the past.Worth watching, as long as you don't expect a swashbuckling adventure movie with Clark Gable swinging from tree to tree.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

Nowhere near politically correct these days, but that just dates it absolutely as another of Hollywood's big productions designed to counter the encroaching power of TV in those days.The cinematography is great, the drumming and singing soundtrack is suitably African and the casting is spot-on. But, overall, this is Ava Gardner's movie (as Honey Bear Kelly), as she sashays around trying to get big Vic Marswell (Gable) interested in her, and all the while trying to disengage him from the seductiveness of Linda Nordley (Grace Kelly), the wife of a very posh English anthropologist, Donald Nordley (Donald Sinden).Now, I know that strange things can happen on safaris, but it was a bit of a stretch for me to accept the premise that a guy like Marswell would fall for a wimp like Linda. But, I suppose it's possible.The best scenes in this movie are when Honey Bear is exploring Marswell's zoo and finding out about animals in general, and displaying her ignorance in the process ? the quintessential dumb blonde, only this time she's as brunette! And, the best dialog is between Marswell and Honey Bear ? crackling, suggestive, smart and spicy. In contrast, the dialog for the Nordley's is hilariously stuffy to the point of being camp. Now, again, I know that it was different times, but it seems to me that it was such a marked contrast to the others that it was meant to be parody. When you see this, you'll see what I mean...As another example of big budget productions from that era, it's worth seeing. It's also worth seeing Gardner poke fun at Gable's big ears...Now, if you want a serious movie about African safari and adventure, go see King Solomon's Mines (1950) and don't bother watching any other version ? I kid you not.</fullReview>

He portrays a game hunter in this film.Romance between the two is interrupted when Grace Kelly arrives with her British scientist husband,who is in Africa to study the gorillas.While you hear the traditional native African songs during this safari, the film certainly isn't about animal hunting. It deals with Gable being torn by Gardner and Kelly.Gardner lets down her hair and reveals that she is a war widow. Kelly is an erudite British lady with an authentic British accent to boot.Good thing there is romance blossoming here; otherwise, this would have made for one dull film. Kelly's performance as a straight-laced British lady smitten by Gable and therefore undergoing a complete personality change is engrossing. She is a repressed woman and this makes for some interesting fireworks among all concerned.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In Africa, a hunter (Clark Gable) who catches animals for zoos has two women come for safari; one is a worldly, nightclubbing dame (Ava Gardner) and the other a demure, Bostonian wife (Grace Kelly). Both find the macho man irresistible.I like the three stars a lot, but I didn't care much for this movie. Gable's character is a silly caricature of rugged manliness; he growls orders, drinks a lot, and grabs women too roughly. He was only 52, but looked much older and was past his Rhett Butler glory days. Kelly is good but seems to be trying oh-so-hard to be stern and matronly with much lip-pouting and overdoing the accent. Gardner plays her usual sexy, sadder-but-wiser part, but her dialogue is phony and stagy, her character overblown and never believable.While the animal-catching and scenes of marginalized natives are terribly out of fashion and off-putting, the location scenery is beautiful, especially filmed in brilliant Technicolor. With two gorgeous women fighting for Clark Gable, I imagine the movie was quite sensational when it came out in 1953, but now I found it corny and silly.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually sumptuous, and the sterling cast make up for a so-so story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a remake of Red Dust, and while it is inferior, having a so-so story and a less humorous script, it is still worth seeing for the location shooting and the cast. The location shooting is absolutely gorgeous, with exotic scenery and stunning cinematography, and the direction is above decent.It is in the performances though where Mogambo scores highest. Clark Gable plays his role with crusty demeanour and wit, and Grace Kelly looks really beautiful, but it is Ava Gardner's show all the way with the actress in one of her lovelier performances along with Showboat.Overall, it is definitely worth watching for the cast and locations. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Victor Mardwell runs a trapping company in Kenya.Soon he finds himself between two women, an attractive wild American Honey Bear Kelly and the more conservative Linda Nordley.The only problem with Linda is that she's married to the anthropologist Donald.Mogambo from 1953 deals with such a brave issue than adultery.It doesn't belong to the group of the brightest classics of that era, but it's a nice film anyway.And of course, when the director is John Ford, you can't expect worst of the worst.And the actors' list is really high level.We have the legendary Clark Cable playing Victor.And Honey Bear is played by the one and only Ava Gardner.The glorious Grace Kelly is Linda.She won a Golden Globe from her performance.Her husband is played by Donald Sinden, and he does a terrific job.And great job by Philip Stainton, who plays John Brown-Pryce.Eric Pohlman is great as Leon Boltchak.It's pretty awesome to watch some of the shots in the African jungle.And all those animals, like the gorillas and the leopards.It only shows you how much safer it is to watch all that stuff at home.The film looks authentic, since it was filmed on Safari in Africa.This African adventure is a nice experience.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Mogambo is a 1953 film directed by John Ford, featuring Clark Gable, Ava Gardner, Grace Kelly and Donald Sinden. The film was adapted by John Lee Mahin from the play by Wilson Collison. Kelly won a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress (1954), and the film was nominated for two Oscars, Best Actress in a Leading Role (Gardner), and Best Actress in a Supporting Role (Kelly). Mogambo is a lavish remake of the classic film Red Dust (1932). The earlier movie also featured Gable in the lead role. I enjoyed this movie about love in the deep of Africa. You have a 52 year old Clark Gable falling in love with a young 24 year old Grace Kelly while 30 year old Ava Gardner fights too for his attention. My favorite scene is when all of them are in a boat going down river and they see a elephant with his ears fanned out and his truck rising high above its head and Ava Gardner say that it reminds her of somebody (Clark Gable), the camera cuts to him and he smirks. The scenery at times is pretty good and the story is fun to follow. GimmeClassics</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Passion Safari</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie set in the African Savannah is actually a vehicle for a love triangle: Ava Gardner plays the brunette bombshell that arrives from New York, in high heels, ready for her closeup with an Indian Maharaja who does not show up. This is the tragedy of the film, as we miss seeing what she would have looked like strolling by the African landscape with a royal sari and a couple of pounds of cabochon emeralds in head ornaments. Clark Gable is the animal trapper and super macho of the jungle, in charge of the safari and Grace Kelly is the repressed wife of an English anthropologist who is there to study the language of the gorillas but would have been better off to concentrate on their sexual training instead , as the minute they arrive he starts losing his wife to Gable's powerful and charismatic persona. The film has beautiful moments showing off the landscape and the animals, but it's not great cinematography, it's the intrinsic beauty of the place that is there, the movie itself is like a play happening on top of it. The best acting roles go to the animals here: The trapped leopard that imitates Ava's walk back and forth on the float, the baby elephant who eats bananas from her hand playfully alongside a baby rhino, both are trapped in an enclosure and will be sold for $5,000 each. There is also the Hippo that throws Ava off her seat with a nice spray of water, and the panther that attacks Grace Kelly and unfortunately, is shot down by Gable. Why do we feel that it would have been GREAT if the animal had gone inside the trap and had her for lunch?? Because by that point we can't stand her and also know that a glamorous obituary in the Times is all she needs to put her out of all trouble, permanently. From a Contemporary viewing point these animals are the true heroes of the movie. They stand by silent and graceful amidst this white trash that is there destroying their environment, polluting their air with their cigarettes and cars and either killing them or taking them to circus/zoos destinations. Real nice. The record is no better when it gets down to the treatment the natives get from this dysfunctional crew of alcoholic, neurotic white contingent. The Africans get yelled at, have towels thrown at them and are talked about pretty much in the same terms than the animals, yet they clearly have a much more dignified presence than the people they serve, when they stand up close the brutish barbarian is obviously the fat man with the gun. One deeply regrets that when they set out on the big canoes a pack pf hippos does not clash into them and drowns them all, which would be a more than happy ending for their misguided and abusive lives. Never before have I seen in a movie so clearly delineated the superiority of animals over humans, but this was surely not intentional. There is also the'civilizing' presence of a priest who is a clear demonstration even by the way he looks, that this religion is wrong for the people. The church he has managed to build inside a hut has the eerie atmosphere of a Martian compound so alien does it look within the environment, and it helps understanding why the new African nations, burdened with this well intentioned, yet cumbersome interventions, have such difficulties in making progress. The love triangle is also more difficult to understand from our contemporary perspective, but here it is: Gable's character is enthralled by the idea of falling in love with a white, educated, upper class prude that flashes 'respectable upper class' form the first scene. Her get up alone is ridiculous: perfectly ironed silk kimonos, sweaters with pearl necklaces in the middle of the African heat (sometimes it went as high as 130 degrees while filming) though ideal for the Hamptons, one can not believe this would be possible in the middle of the jungle and makes one appreciate the hundreds of assistants that must have been present constantly changing costumes and wiping brows. Grace Kelly gives one of her best performances as this emotional invalid from Frigidity land that has accidentally awakened like a twisted spore in the midst of the heat and Gable's fertilizing testosterone presence. Her husband is so stereotyped he even dines in the hut in a tuxedo, you can figure out the rest, so one can not blame her for what happened. Ava had the most difficult role in portraying human values in a 'fallen woman' that looks like a fish out of water from the first scene. But she quickly adapts, and does a very good job at trying to seduce Gable. She is authentically convincing as a wholesome city hustler coming to grips with real deep emotions while looking absolutely ravishing. My favorite scene is of her atop a truck swaying and chanting with the natives creating her own choreography. Gable dominates the scenes with his strong presence, never was the title "King of Hollywood' been more tangible than in this film. The supporting cast of slobs that hang out around Gable evaporates from memory with the last screen credit.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hollywood in the heart of Africa</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo, directed by John Ford is a good example of how you can have a film by a great director with great stars, some of whom give good performances shot with amazing camera work in the heart of Africa. . .and still end up with sort of a dud of a picture. The story itself is rather bland. Clark Gable is supposed to be attracted to the meekishly vulnerable (and extremely young) Grace Kelly, when Ava Gardner is right there sexy and sassy and the only other bright member of the cast (and closer to his own age too). Grace Kelly's performance is not very good. She overacts rather miserably in many of the scenes (though somehow she managed to win a Golden Globe award FOR it. Ughhh!). There are some gaping plausibility holes (like how in the world the women stay so fresh and beautiful for one on a long safari). Unfortunately, the film seems devoid of any real plot, except for the fact that the women are fighting over the great white hunter/safari leader, Gable. But Ava Gardner shines with the best dialogue. And Gable gives a strong performance, looking very fit, though he is no spring chicken. The photography is quite splendid. The sound score is quite good as well. But the implausibilities, along with a rather weak supporting cast (and some of the dull headed dialogue by them) bring this picture down to a bit below eye level for a John Ford movie in my opinion.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated - just underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>MOGAMBO is not a groundbreaking masterpiece, its not Ford, Gable or Kellys best performance, but its highly entertaining and a real "Hollywood-picture". Its actually better than "Red dust", which its a remake of. The color-picture fit perfect to the film (Really old-time Technicolor-fashion!) It also show Gable fantastic ability, that he 20 years later can play the same role with this power. Gardner has her best role and Grace Kelly is on right way (still she missed Hitch) she is funny: DID HE BURN YOU OFF? and off course - but not necessary to say - incredibly beautiful. Sinton on the other hand is a little bit boring, but actually it fit OK in his role. 8,5/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Old Hollywood at its prime.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I noticed that the vast majority of those who voted for this movie gave it a "7", which seems just about the perfect rating. It's an occasionally entertaining but overlong drama, set in the African jungles, which John Ford doesn't really capture with too much flavor, despite lots and lots of "exotic" footage. And contrary to what others have said, I would have taken Grace Kelly over Ava Gardner any day of the week; not only does she seem more beautiful to me, but she also comes off as a much more likable character than the bitchy-but-meant-to-be-charming-and-sensitive-after-all Gardner.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ava Gardner Vs. Grace Kelly</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a movie on Grace Kelly yesterday referencing Mogambo. What luck that it was on today. Absolutely loved the African footage and kept wondering if it is still like that today. But I am perplexed as to why everyone is so taken with Ava Gardner. I thought she was funny, thought she got the great lines and her reaction to some of Grace Kelly's prim responses were very funny. But a great Hollywood beauty? Grace Kelly is beautiful. Someone remarked on her accent. I would like to have that sort of clipped lyrical way of speaking. Ava seemed to have the funny best friend sort of role to me and I still don't see why Frank Sinatra was so obsessed with her. Go figure!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor remake of the classic Red Dust</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A toned-down, less satisfying remake of Red Dust from 1932. This update moves the story from South East Asia to Africa, changes Gable's character from a rubber tree farm owner to that of big game hunter, changes Harlow's call girl character to Gardner playing a reporter, and so on. The outline of the story remains generally the same, but the steamy sexual nature that permeated the first movie -- without any actual sex being shown -- as well as all the sauciness and bluster of the first film is all but gone in this 1953 remake. Both are excellent studies in how films of both eras poorly portrayed "the natives", no matter where on Earth a story takes place.</fullReview>

The plans are as lessons: the light, the colors, everything is so well done.One can see a million films with that landscape but besides Out of Africa this was the movie that showed so strongly why so many people fall for it .Also tells how difficult it was to live in places where adventure was so real. Missionaires, hunters, natives that had their own rules sometimes hostile.Actors were the best!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Solid performances by the cast!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For many years I've been hearing my father rave about Mogambo , a movie which he had watched in his teens and loved since. I finally got a chance to watch it recently and I was very excited. But as I started watching it my excitement soon turned to a little bit of disappointment. I just could not digest the story line where Gable kept switching affections between two ladies like it was as simple as choosing between tea and coffee. There was something missing in the movie like something more was capable but did not happen. It leaves you feeling a little unsatisfied. But what made it worth watching was Ava Gardner. Gardner completely stole the show. Her acting was brilliant and scenes with her in them were the most lively. Also a very solid performance by Clark Gable as a cynical man. Grace Kelly as usual looked beautiful and held her own between Gable and Gardner. The cinematography is beautiful. The portrayal of Africa and it's tribes and safaris is very realistic. Something very uncommon at that time as most of all kinds of movies were shot in studios. In all I would say a Good watch only because of the acting but not a Great watch.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Watered Down Remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Mogambo (1953) ** (out of 4) Remake of Red Dust follows the same story pretty much, although this version is watered down of any sexuality and the location has been changed to Africa. This time out, Clark Gable plays a big game hunter who has an affair with a woman (Ava Gardner), which doesn't sit well when he falls for a scientist's wife (Grace Kelly). I've read there were all sorts of production problems with this film and that Ford and Gable were fighting from start to finish. This seems understandable but the film's failures has to go to Ford. It seems he's more interested in the animals and wildlife of Africa than he is in telling the story of the love triangle. The majority of the scenes with the actors come off quite boring and rather lifeless. The film's major saving grace are the scenes with the wildlife but even these start to get boring after a while. Kelly steals the show with her performance but the rest of the cast aren't too good. I think Gardner is too old for her role and she comes off pretty annoying. Gable is decent in his role but this certainly isn't near the best of his performances.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>prettier and more sophisticated re-make of RED DUST</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a reworking of RED DUST--another Gable film from the early 1930s. Overall, I think both this film and RED DUST are about equal in quality but they will appeal to different audiences. RED DUST is definitely a pre-Code film, with a certain sleazy quality and a lot of energy. Mogambo was made two decades later and looks prettier and this is due to its higher production values (except for a couple back-projected scenes that looked rather hokey). And, it's a little more sophisticated in how it portrays adultery. Frankly, though, considering this film was made by director John Ford, it really is a bit of a let-down. It just doesn't have a lot of magic or lasting appeal. For those wanting a prettier and more polished film, see MOGAMBO. For me, I actually prefer the grittier and less polished original. However, if you want you could just see one--they are similar enough that you don't miss much. I watched both because I love Gable films, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>not too great except for the cool wild animals and scenery</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although Grace Kelly is stunningly beautiful, some of her performances come across as very wooden. It almost seems as if she cannot portray any depth on screen. Sure, she can scream and make a scene, but it just does not have the impact that other female stars have. On the other hand, Ava Gardner was also a little too unbelievable. I realize this is the early 1950's but were women really that jealous of one man after barely even getting to know him? The first hour of the movie, the "jealousy thing" between Kelly's character and Gardner's character got really annoying. Also, the script was pretty lame. The script got better as the movie progressed, but not enough to make me think this was a good movie.I consider Gable to be a great actor, but he didn't have much to do here except play the stereotypical tough guy who "rescues" the helpless women from the African bush. Any B-movie actor probably could have pulled this off without much effort. His dialog was as lame as the female characters were.What is stunning about this movie is how John Ford and the cinematographer really tried to focus on the flora and fauna of Africa in technicolor. This made the movie enjoyable, at least when the African natives weren't screaming or singing too loud to drown everything out. Maybe the effect was better on the big screen.Not one of the worst movies I have seen, but not much to grab a viewer's attention, either. If I had to pick a much better 1950s movie about Africa, it would be Hatari.</fullReview>
