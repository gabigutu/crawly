		<fullReview>On a perfectly normal, lovely afternoon in the English countryside, a small town is suddenly taken over by an unseen presence. Everyone within the town - man, woman and child - suddenly passes out cold for no apparent reason whatsoever. Anyone who attempts to enter the town from the outside is also stricken down, yet revive instantaneously when removed from the danger zone. No one, not police or military, can pass the invisible barrier, but within a few hours the strange presence is gone. Everyone seems to be alright...until a few weeks later, when all of the women in town who are of childbearing age discover themselves to be pregnant. Nine months later, a dozen identical children are born to these somewhat suspicious mothers, children with white- blond hair and scary eyes that glow. The children are oddly emotionless and only associate with each other, acting as a single entity. Worst of all, they can make anyone do whatever they want them to do, which often has fatal results. Can kindly schoolteacher (the wonderful George Sanders), whose beloved wife has borne one of these creatures, help the alien children embrace their human half? Or will he have to destroy them all?This is an absolute masterpiece of paranoia, sci-fi style. The acting is superb, especially by the late and under-appreciated Mr. Sanders, whose compassion and intellect sets the tone for this quiet and somewhat sad little tale. The lovely Barbara Shelley as Sanders loving wife is sweet and totally believable. Indeed, the townsfolk are all very realistic and approachable, kind and simple folk who don't really deserve the wrath of the spooky children who have invaded their small town. Young Martin Stephens, who also turned in a creepy performance in the ghostly masterpiece "The Innocents" is every bit as creepy here as George and Barbara's "son." Filmed in moody black and white, this movie creeps along with all the menacing stealth of a thick London pea souper. This is an intelligent horror film which deserves better attention. It probably won't be appreciated by people who consider expletives and explosions to be main characters, but for people who prefer horror with brains (and not brains ripped out of skulls) this is the film for them. Fans of George Sanders shouldn't miss this; it's quite a switch from his usual smarmy roles, and a nice switch at that.Highly recommended!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brick wall, brick wall</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This classic low budget, black and white film is right up there with the best of the sci-fi/horror movies of the time. It appears that it was shot on a very low budget ($300,000), thus no special effects beyond the superimposed glowing eyes of the children and the burning house at the end (not much of an effect). But it became a real moneymaker and a cult developed around it. They went on to make a sequel which doesn't live up to the original.The cast, though limited, is quite good. The ever sophisticated, urbane, George Sanders as the scientist; Barbara Shelley from Hammer films as his wife; and little Martin Stephens as David, putative offspring of Shelley and Sanders. This kid is evil personified and does a bang-up job for such a youngster.The story involves the village of Midwich and the birth of 12 children fathered in a very strange way that is never totally explained, who are intellectual giants with one purpose.....take over the world. Should they be destroyed or studied?....that's the problem facing Sanders and the government. Sanders comes to the inevitable conclusion and because they can read his thoughts, he must think of a brick wall in order to mask his intent. The ending, although not surprising is still effective.This film is a keeper and is recommended to all those who like their films straight to the point without all the special effects and computer generated action. It's minimal with maximum punch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is a strongly compelling Science-Fiction highlight and easily of the eeriest movies I ever saw. Although it's a very modest and simply made production, the scary-effect of this film is a lot more effective than some of its big-budgeted colleagues. On a random day, the entire English village of Midwich falls into a trance-like sleep. Completely inexplicably, they awake again seemly normal but two months later it appears that every fertile woman in town got pregnant on the day of the blackout. The newborns show a strange resemblance in looks and ? what is even more bizarre ? they're telekinetic! Due to their amazing intelligence and emotionless behavior, they form a huge threat and freak out the entire little town. `Village of the Damned' is loyally adapted from John Wyndham's novel `The Midwich Cuckoos'. Throughout the whole film, you don't get much explanation and, as a viewer, you're forced to guess at the mystery's origin. Although highly unlikely, the events in Midwich really are alarming and make you feel uncomfortable. This effect is reached through solid tension and macabre atmosphere much more than through special effects. The eerily lit eyes of the ?children' are the only real effects but they cause a lot more fear than gallons of blood ever could! Village of the Damned also owes a lot of its power to a terrific casting job. Essentially to achieve the obtained scary effect were the children. Well, they did a good job! The offspring looks alienated almost naturally and their appearance literally chills your blood. The concerned adult in Village of the Damned is excellently played by George Sanders. Sanders was a terrific and shamefully overlooked English class actor who committed suicide in the early 70's. He has a got a few other delightful horror movies on his repertoire like `Psychomania' and `Doomwatch' (both are some of his last films). Village of the Damned is a highly recommended picture that'll certainly keep you close to the screen till the end-credits role. Equally recommended is the (unofficial) sequel called `Children of the Damned'. There's a bit more background in that film, as well as some more explicit horror sequences. The 1995 remake by John Carpenter, however, is rather unexciting and one of the most redundant films ever made. Stick to the original and be scared!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>a fantastic and minimalistic thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I am giving this film a 10 based on the "bang for the buck" it provides. Despite having a small budget, few special effects and an unknown cast (aside from George Sanders), it is an engrossing and terrifying sci-fi adventure.The movie begins with a VERY STRANGE occurrence--a small village just STOPS. All people life within the village stops--machinery, animals and people. And, when the military tries to enter the town, the soldiers just STOP as well--falling into comas. Then, just as suddenly, everyone awakens--none the worse for wear. Or so it would seem, for later, many women in this small hamlet are found to be pregnant! Once these little bundles of joy are born, the fun begins as these brilliant but disturbingly freaky kids slowly scare the crap out of everyone--especially as they walk, talk and look alike and speak as one (sort of like an evil version of Huey, Dewey and Louie)! And, it turns out, they are apparently unstoppable and up to some sort of evil (though exactly what they intend is uncertain--but it MUST be bad considering their evil proclivities)! NOTE: Do NOT see the supposed sequel, "Children of the Damned". It's terrible. Instead of the kids harassing people (such as making them crash their cars into walls or blow their heads off), the kids are misunderstood and only want to live in peace!! What crap--I want murder and global domination! Another NOTE: Do NOT see the recent remake of Village of the Damned. It lacks the subtlety of the original and just does NOTHING to improve an already great film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Eerie little thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I originally saw this when I was in junior high on late night TV. Those glowing eyes gave me nightmares for weeks! Seeing it now MANY years later, it still scares me. It's very quiet but very spooky. No real on-screen violence, no special effects (with the exception of the eyes) and all talk but never dull. The film is intelligent, doesn't talk down to the audience and handles the subject matter in a very realistic manner. Most people in horror films act like idiots--not in this one! Also some superb acting by George Sanders, Barbara Shelley (as his wife) and those creepy little kids (especially Martin Stephens) helps a lot. Proves a quiet little, goreless film can scare you silly. AT ALL COSTS, AVOID THE 1995 REMAKE!!!!!!! Carpenter's a great director, but you can't remake a great film. See this one!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Low-key and very effective sci-fi horror, made with intelligence and restraint</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The best way to watch this movie is ignorantly. Go to Netflix now, put the movie at the top of your queue and watch it when it arrives. Read about it later. If you enjoy sci-fi classics like "The Day the Earth Stood Still" and "Them!"; if you love the Britishness of the Hammer horror pictures; if you prefer a well-told story, rich suspense, sympathetic characters and black-and-white photography to special effects, color and gore, you will want to see this film right away.The movie begins in Midwich. We meet the scientist Gordon Zellaby having a telephone conversation. Mid-sentence he passes out. At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. When the army gets involved, we discover this force has precise boundaries. One soldier, after being lassoed around the waist, walks past the boundary, loses consciousness and immediately revives when his fellows pull him out of the infected area. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant.Watching this science-fiction movie paired with almost any modern one demonstrates how storytelling has devolved as special effects have advanced. It also demonstrates how one simple effect can be more memorable than a thousand complex ones. I happened to see this just before watching "The Forgotten" (2005), a stupid movie with expensive effects; but not of those expensive effects is as potent as this movie's signature device. When the blonde-haired Midwich children wreak psychic havoc, the picture freezes and their eyes glow. That inexpensive trick shot is worth the millions blown on "The Forgotten."Another nice effect: George Sanders. He plays the hero, Gordon Zellaby, a scientist who becomes a dubious father to one of the Midwich freaks. Sanders plays rogues in almost every other movie, but here he is sweet-natured and convincingly so; he betrays not a shadow of his usual cynicism. Were this his only surviving film, one would think he was born to play kindly old men. The excellent cast has one other outstanding performance by Martin Stephens, who plays Sanders's cold-hearted "son." Would you be surprised to learn his voice was dubbed by a female actress specializing in children? I was surprised to learn it wasn't. That is the boy's own eerily precise diction.Special praise must also go to the director and photographer, Wolf Rilla and Geoffrey Faithful, who give the movie the detached air of a documentary. The script, credited to Stirling Silliphant, George Barclay and Rilla, is an excellent adaptation of a fine book, "The Midwich Cuckoos" by John Beynon Harris. Fans of this movie will want to read it. The book has many enjoyable details that were necessarily and wisely cut from the adaptation. To note one difference, the children in the movie are psychically linked: what one knows they all know. But in the book, the boys are psychically linked with the boys, the girls with the girls; but there is little or no link between the two sexes. The reasons for this are fascinating.I haven't seen the John Carpenter remake, and I don't want to. What would the ideal remake of this film look like? It would look like the original: black-and-white, set in the late fifties, cast with Brits and scripted with the same restraint. Maybe modern resources could add a piquant touch or two; it would be amusing to see all those sheep fall asleep in the opening scene. Oh, and that awful model shot of the school could be replaced. Otherwise, we have the film we want, so why remake it?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great classic thriller, unfortunately overshadowed by the spectacular psychological thriller released the same year - Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is a very well-made thriller that seems to have been overlooked because of the sheer magnitude of its competition - Psycho. Both of these films are testaments to the idea that low budgets are very capable of producing great films. It is not the size of the budget that matters, it is the skill of the filmmakers and the actors. Village of the Damned makes use of a variety of very easily done but also very effective special effects, such as the boundary across which all people and animals lose consciousness, the creepy eyes on those kids, and their hypnotic powers.The discussion of the exact same phenomenon happening to a few remote towns all over the world does a lot to show what these kids can do, and it increases the dramatic tension of the film as a whole. Cheaply made, but also very well made because a lot of thought was obviously put into it, Village of the Damned is a timeless thriller, even in black and white. When you watch a movie like this, if you are the kind of person who is so superficial about your movies that you refuse to watch black and white films, keep in mind that black and white photography REQUIRES good acting, to put it in the immortal words of Orson Welles. You can't have black and white photography and bad acting, the film would never work. Village of the Damned takes black and white photography and fills it with excellent acting, a fascinating story, and good direction that makes me wonder why this was the only film that Wolf Rilla ever directed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Them Their Eyes</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A small countryside village in England experiences a time period of several hours where all living things lie lifeless and helpless. Anything living that connects within this sphere of lifelessness gets the like treatment. Everyone soon awakens from whatever happened, and soon the women of child-bearing years all get pregnant and are all due on the same day. Village of the Damned is one of those discerning, intelligent science fiction films of yesteryear that tends to leave much to your imagination in terms of gore and violence as well as make you think and ponder important questions about the limits with which humanity should go to procure knowledge. The children are decidedly very creepy as their eyes glow when they are angered. Martin Stephens as George Sanders' boy is particularly good as he looks and speaks with such class and distinction yet has the conscience of a cold-blooded, calculated killer. Sanders is also very good in his role as a man torn between bridging the field of knowledge with the unknown and protecting mankind from foreign/alien harm. His wife, played with credibility, is Hammer beauty Barbara Shelley. A great British science fiction film and certainly one of the more thought-provoking ones around.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Excellent Stuff...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>at least if you're a science fiction and horror fan. There's a great build-up here and a very satisfying climax. This has a wonderful eerie feel reminiscent of the feeling one gets watching "the original Outer Limits". The story feels a little bit more like "the Twilight Zone" however with the questions of morality, right and wrong it raises. This film might not appeal as widely to non-genre fans but it's classic great stuff for the fan. Best scenes involve the eyes--it's a very effective nightmare when it's your own children who are the evil ones(or are they?).</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>George Sanders Made this a Classic Film!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a great Classic film mainly because of the great movie star George Sanders(Gordon Zellaby),"Hangover Square",'45, who unfortunately took his own life. In this film Sanders plays a professor and has the great pleasure of raising a child with Barbara Shelley(Antnea Zellaby), who turns out to become a child with glaring eyes and a very bad temper! It seems the children in this film seem to grow at a very rapid pace and have great hidden abilities to do just about everything they want in controlling the minds of all ADULTS! In 1960, this was a great Horror film and captivated the movie goers. This is truly a great Classic Film to enjoy!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This is what happens when you don't beat them enough.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A cheap, well executed British SciFi film about a cohort of superintelligent, mind-reading children growing up in a small English village.The original title of the story, I think, was "The Midwitch Cuckoos," a less exploitative but far more appropriate title than "Village of the Damned." We may think of cuckoos as a cute wooden thing that comes out of a gingerbread clock and makes funny noises to announce the time, but that's because we are not birds. Real cuckoos are brood parasites. They lay eggs in the nests of other species of birds. The other birds fecklessly hatch them. And, man, are the cuckoo hatchlings ugly -- gray, featherless, sinewy things that immediately go about the business of rolling the other eggs out of the nest to get rid of the competition. They are born evil.In this movie the cuckoos are children. Their mothers were impregnated by -- well, by some kind of extraterrestrial infrared hypermolecular cosmological incubus. Anyway, all the women of Midwich become pregnant during a blackout period that encompasses the entire village for a few hours. It's chilling from the outset to see others try to enter the village and flop down as soon as they cross an invisible boundary.These kids aren't ugly though. They all have blond hair and magnetic eyes. And what one of them learns, the others know immediately. But handsome or not, they can immediately solve one of those Chinese-box puzzles in which you have to slide panels around, up and down, until you expose the inner drawer. It always takes me ten times as long as it take them.This is an intelligent science fiction thriller. Here are these dozen or so kids, who have powers beyond the natural and need no one except each other. Like autists they don't show any affection for anyone or indeed any emotion at all, unless determination is an emotion. Their biological mothers mean nothing to them, the supposed "fathers" even less. What they need is a good dose of what Rousseau called "amour propre," love of self based on the opinions of others. It won't make them happy but they'll be less destructive. What they seem to want as they grow into preadolescents is to be left alone except for what tutoring George Sanders as the requisite professor can give them in earthly knowledge. They're mortal enough. An independent community of them has been destroyed in the USSR. And they're dangerous too. In three instances -- one accidental, two deliberate -- a villager almost kills some of them, and he dies the way he intended them to die.Why are they here on earth? Nobody knows. If the kids know, they're not telling. National leaders sit around in conferences wondering what to do with them. It's not easy to put a bunch of 10-year-olds in prison, let alone destroy them. It's not just morally difficult, it's practically difficult too because, after all, these kids can read the "front part" of everybody's mind. (They're working on the back rooms too.) Sanders proposes that the government give him a year to teach them in the local school and to study them, and the wish is granted.But eventually Sanders comes to realize that when they are grown the children will have all the power and knowledge they need to take over the entire world, and maybe that IS their goal. They show nothing in the way of humane impulses. If they only kill when they are threatened, well that can change as soon as they pick up some of the values of the world they're now living in. Yes -- ruthless fascist dictators seem about the right slots for them. I can't readily visualize them as Gestalt psychotherapists.Sanders decides that they have to go, but it's a problem because, although he's about the only person in the village they feel any trust for, they can also read his intentions. And naturally if he succeeds in ridding the world of these kids, he must go with them because, really, how can you murder these beautiful intelligent children and go on living with yourself. In order to accomplish his goal, he must think of nothing but a brick wall, so they can't read his mind. But they are suspicious and their collective power begins to cause the brick wall to crumble -- too late.I said this was a low-budget flick and it is. There are hardly any special effects to speak of. The production couldn't even afford to pay a stunt man for a full body burn. The performances are fine, but the direction is no more than efficient, and the art direction and photography project a chilly and grimy atmosphere which seems to have occurred naturally.I also said it was intelligent and it is. It's not exactly a horror flick because it has no monsters or murderers and it's not exactly science fiction in the usual sense because it takes place in the present and there isn't a robot in sight. What it does is use improbable events to pose a series of important moral questions. Nobody would argue that these kids are likable. And maybe their Daddies were nothing more than a shower of golden coins or a stream of photons. But they look human and in many ways act it. They don't want to die -- they know about mortality.They certainly DO seem dangerous but they haven't done anything irredeemably evil yet. Sanders decides that there's nothing wrong with them that a darn good blowing up wouldn't cure and we applaud when he manages to carry out his plan. But he's making an awful lot of questionable assumptions. Do they deserve to be killed en masse? Would YOU kill them all?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Like the scariest unreleased episode of The Twilight Zone</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I grew up watching The Simpsons, one of the episodes that is a classic favorite of mine has a little parody of Village of the Damned they called The Bloodening, lol. I always thought it was supposed to be a parody of Children of the Corn, but then I was watching 100 Scariest Movie Moments on Bravo and Village of the Damned came on and then the light bulb went on that this was the story the Simpsons made fun of. But I was so memorized by what scenes they were showing that I had to find this movie and watch it, I finally found it online last night and I absolutely loved this movie. This is one of the creepiest horror movies I have ever seen, so many people who always told me that creepy kids scare them, I never understood why until I saw this film last night, it gave me nightmares. Granted, I know that it's cheesy and you can easily MST3K your way through it, but watching this in the dark with those creepy glowing eyes is an image I will never get out of my head.In the small English village of Midwich everybody and everything falls into a deep, mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. Some months later every woman capable of child-bearing is pregnant and the children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange, penetrating eyes that make people do things they don't want to do.Village of the Damned is a very memorable film and just scared the living day lights out of me. I would highly recommend this for any one who truly appreciates film, because it is cheesy in some aspects, I think it takes a certain person to really understand this film and in the time it was made. The way these kids looked was just beyond disturbing, they looked alike, sounded alike, and acted alike. Those voices were so light, care free, it just got into your head that these kids had no boundaries and that's what's scary, you know that if a child has those powers, there would be no adults in this world. Village of the Damned is a terrific horror film, I highly recommend it, watch it in the dark, it's a lot of fun.9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In London, the military Alan Bernard (Michael Gwynn) is talking to his brother-in-law Gordon Zellaby (George Sanders) in Midwich by telephone when there is a communication breakdown with the village. Alan heads to the British village and finds that all the inhabitants have fallen unconscious at the same time and who else crosses the borderline faints. Out of the blue, the inhabitants awake at the same time. Two months later Anthea Zellaby (Barbara Shelley) tells her husband Gordon that she is pregnant. But soon, the local Dr. Willers (Laurence Naismith) and Gordon realizes that every woman in the village of childbearing age is pregnant. Anthea and the other women deliver perfect children and soon Dr. Willers note that all the children have strange eyes, short fingernails and different blond hair. Gordon also finds that his son David (Martin Stephens) is a leader of the children that have no feelings and what one learns, the others also learn. Further they are capable to read and control minds and are a menace to the inhabitants of Midwich. Will Gordon be capable to keep the children under control?"Village of the Damned" is a mysterious and scary horror movie, with an original story in the style of "The Twilight Zone". The plot is intriguing and has not aged. The performances are excellent and the simple special effect of the eyes of the children associated to their performances is frightening. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil):"A Aldeia dos Amaldiçoados" ("The Village of the Damned")</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic British Sci-Fi about some Midwich women who are mysteriously pregnant by strange forces</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Some women give birth various strange children with supernatural power and extraordinary intelligence . An suspenseful and interesting premise dealing about several strangely emotionless children all born at the same time in a small village in Midwich . The scene is a village called Midwich in which a rare event overcomes the idyllic location . At the same moment, every single person and animal in town has passed out just as suddenly ; some unknown force has put all the inhabitants of Midwich to sleep. Everybody falls into a deep, mysterious sleep for several hours in the middle of the day. When the army gets involved, they find this force has precise boundaries. A few hours later, this strange force disappears and everyone wakes up. The mystery remains unsolved for weeks, but it has a sequel. Later on , every woman (Barbara Shelley married to George Sanders) capable of child-bearing is pregnant . All Midwich women of childbearing age are unaccountably pregnant . Nine months later, the babies are born, and they all look normal, but it doesn't take the "parents" long to realise that the kids are not human or humane .And the glowing-eyed children (Martin Stephens , among others) they have will prove to be worse than what they could have feared. The children that are born out of these pregnancies seem to grow very fast and they all have the same blond hair and strange, penetrating eyes that make people do things , all of them have telephatic powers , the stare will paralyze the will of the villagers . They result to be mind-controlling demons or aliens . Meanwhile a government officer (good performance by George Sanders) along with the doctor (Laurence Naismith) attempt to stop their plans of conquest .This classic Sci-Fi thriller contains chills , suspense , intrigue and creepy events about some precocious deadly children and their quest of power . MGM shelved the project, because it was deemed potentially inflammatory and controversial, specifically due to its sinister depiction of virgin birth . Eerie and strange plot very well developed by the screen-written Sterling Silliphant based on John Wyndham novel titled "The Midwich Cuckoos" that focuses a British village visited by some unknown life form which leaves the women of the village pregnant. Performance is frankly good as main cast as Barbara Shelley and Ronald Colman was originally supposed to star in this film but he passed away in 1958 and was replaced by an excellent George Sanders who married Colman's widow Benita Hume . Exceptional support cast formed by prestigious Brit actors as Michael G. Wynne , Laurence Naismith and very secondary Peter Vaughan as Policeman . Special mention to Martin Stephens as an unsettling little boy , his creepy effect of the glowing eyes was made by matting a negative image of their eyes over the pupils . Intriguing and atmospheric musical score by Ron Goodwin . Furthermore , it packs appropriate cinematography in black and white by Geoffrey Faithful who photographs splendidly the scenarios from the village . This suspenseful and thrilling film is well directed by Wolf Rilla . Rating : Very good , providing pleasant screams for the viewer . Essential and indispensable seeing for Barbara Shelley and George Sanders followers . Other renditions based on John Wyndham novel titled ¨The Midwich cuckoos¨ and well adapted by Stirling Silliphant are the following : A nice sequel titled ¨Children of the damned (64)¨ by Anton Leader with Ian Hendry , Alan Badel and Barbara Ferris . It's subsequently made an acceptable remake (1995) titled ¨John Carpenter's Village of the damned¨ with the same premise still interesting enough to watch it and starred by Kirstie Alley , Christopher Reeve and Mark Hamill ; however, it suffers from unimaginative account because being a copy from original film with more violent and explicit scenes and fails to provide the intelligent atmosphere from previous story .</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Wyndham Adaptation That Sticks To The Book</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing the BBC travesty that claims to be based on John Wyndham's DAY OF THE TRIFFIDS I decided to catch the film version of The Midwich Cuckoos given the more melodramatic title of VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED and wasn't disappointed . It's a very faithful adaptation of the author's work showing the strength and weakness of Wyndham's writing Like most of Wyndham's work the theme of mankind trying to survive the presence on Earth of an alien life form is well realised . The aliens in question - a new breed of children - are portrayed as being amoral rather than cruel and belligerent . The problem with this is that people nowadays are far more used to " talking monsters " where they come to Earth and explain their plans and motives to the human characters and The Midwich Cukoos is probably the closest Wyndham came to these type of aliens . Certainly if you read The Kraken Wakes you might be surprised that humanity is incapable of making any kind of communication to the aliens If there's a downside to this type of writing it's that much of the drama revolves around scientists , military men and government bureaucrats sitting around tables discussing the matters in hand and how to deal with the threat . Much of the film is dialogue driven and for an audience brought up on DOCTOR WHO they might find this slightly boring . It's not helped by an old fashioned feel where the likes of the local vicar being a centre for the community and a scene where a character visits the doctor's surgery only to see the doctor pull out out a cigarette and light up Perhaps the most effective scene is the opening where the village inhabitants fall asleep and anyone approaching the village also falls unconscious . This gives a very eerie opening installment along with the revelation that several of the female inhabitants have become pregnant . It's a great premise though to be honest once you know where the plot is going it's not as exciting as you expect . The film also has a rather short running time which means there's not much plotting involved . That said at least it keeps to Wyndham's book and is much better than the 1995 remake by John Carpenter</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Midwich Brick Wall.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is directed by Wolf Rilla and is a fairly faithful adaptation of the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. It stars George Sanders, Barbara Shelley, Martin Stephens &amp; Michael Gwynn. It was originally meant to be an American produced picture starring Ronald Colman but MGM got itchy feet on account of what they deemed as some sinister issues. A couple of years down the line the film was relocated to England and shot on location at Letchmore Heath, with Sanders stepping in for the recently passed away Colman.The peaceful English village of Midwich falls victim to a strange occurrence that sees the inhabitants fall asleep for several hours. With no clue to exactly what happened or what caused such an event, the villagers are further baffled to find all the women of Midwich have suddenly fell pregnant. Come the births of the children it's apparent that all is not well here in this once sleepy little village.The 1950s was a great decade for the sci-fi movie fan, with the paranoia of potential atomic war and communist fervour taking hold, a ream of B movie schlockers tapped into this feverish air of mistrust. With the sight of giant creepy crawlies and atomic monsters rampaging across America creating much fun, it's arguably with the alien invasion that 50s cinema garnered its real terror. Enter English sci-fi writer John Wyndham (The Day Of the Triffids), who wrote The Midwich Cuckoos in 1957. Wyndham came up with an original idea to take the alien invasion premise to another level, use children. Horrible, creepy, blonde haired, blank staring, children.The film in truth is too short to fully do justice to Wyndham's frightening novel, while other issues such as the barely believable coupling of Sanders and Shelley ensures the film has a lot of creakiness within. But it's still a potent bit of sci-fi horror that, come the latter stages, cranks up the creep factor as the children are born and the piece becomes a conventional monster movie. It's here where Rilla does a terrific job of building the dread. Armed with a small budget of under $300 thousand (it was a monster box office smash), the stop frame effects work is surprisingly effective, as are the child actors. Led by the impressive Martin Stephens who a year later would continue the creepy vein as Miles in The Innocents. A more than decent sequel would follow three years later {Children Of the Damned} and a poor remake by John Carpenter would surface in 1995. But it's this one that stands the test of time as a genre classic. Spooky atmosphere coupled with a genuinely intelligent and sinister story makes for an eerie 70 odd minutes of cinema. 8/10</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A superbly eerie, intelligent and ambiguous 60's British sci-fi/horror gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Quite simply one of the all-time great spooky and atmospheric British sci-fi/horror winners from the 60's, this supremely chilling and engrossing knockout still packs a potent, lingering punch even today. All the young women in the quiet remote English hamlet of Midwich mysteriously become pregnant after the whole populace goes into a bizarre and abrupt 24-hour trance. The ladies give birth to a bunch of odd, emotionless, tow-headed kids with extraordinary kinetic and telepathic abilities. They also have glowing bright eyes, unusual fingernails, and acute advanced intellects. Moreover, the murderous moppets casually kill anyone they perceive as a threat in strange and startling "accidents." Some of the frightened townspeople stand up to the freaky tykes to no avail. It's ultimately up to brave and perceptive military scientist George Sanders (who gives a truly outstanding performance) to put a stop to 'em before it's too late.Tautly directed with commendable understatement by Wolf Rilla, with a smart and compact script co-written by future Oscar-winning screenwriter Stirling Stilliphant, gorgeous black-and-white cinematography, a nicely spare and shivery score, an eerily ambiguous tone, a pleasingly concise 78 minute running time, uniformly aces acting from a top-drawer cast (the child thespians are extremely unsettling while Hammer horror queen Barbara Shelley makes for a very charming and pretty damsel in distress), and a genuinely nerve-wracking conclusion, "Village of the Damned" never falters for a minute. The film's smashing success derives partly from Rilla's wisely stark and straightforward execution, partly from the sheer vague creepiness of the intriguing plot (no explanation is ever given for how or why the children were born in the first place), and primarily from downplaying needless flashy special effects razzle-dazzle to emphasize instead the strong and absorbing adults vs. children conflict at the heart of the narrative (this movie could be read as a weird and imaginative fantastic allegory on the generation gap that was a key hallmark of the 60's). A terrific terror tale that's wholly deserving of its substantial classic status.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>"You are thinking of a brick wall..."</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Despite having a name that sounds like a German-Japanese dinosaur movie and a drastically reduced budget after MGM got nervous over the possible reaction from the Catholic Legion of Decency over its alien virgin birth plot device, Wolf Rilla managed to deliver a genuine low-budget classic that makes light of its limitations in Village of the Damned. Surprisingly faithful to the source (The Midwich Cuckoos) despite the many changes, it's another variation on novelist's John Wyndham's big theme, the battle for supremacy between two species ? in this case the human race and the intellectually superior children spawned after a mysterious alien intervention that sees a small village rendered unconscious in a memorably staged sequence that combines the mundane with the inexplicable. Rather than exploiting the premise and the dangerous telekinetic abilities of the children for shock effects (although they do demonstrate them in a couple of memorable sequences), for the most part the film is as much concerned with the twin dilemmas of whether the children are a potential boon or a threat to the human race and of finding a way to defeat or destroy an enemy that not only knows what you're thinking but which is still a part of your own family. With an excellent screenplay, tightly constructed and imaginatively directed with a great ending ? "You are thinking of a brick wall. You are thinking of a brick wall.." ? it holds up remarkably well nearly a half century on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Budget, Big Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I don't think producers of Village of the Damned were willing to spend much money on this movie. In fact, only George Sanders in the cast could be considered as a star and he was on his way back by the time he made this picture. Though Barbara Shelley and Michael Gwynne where often casted in horror films none of the two got even close to reach stardom. I don't think the rest of the actors where known outside England. The movie was filmed in black and white and no decoration or huge sets were needed. No much for special effects even for 1960.But somehow out of this unpretentious film turned out a real little classic in its genre. The idea of alien children dominating adults and killing them with just a look of their shinning eyes works perfectly and makes an interesting sci-fi or even horror story that keeps tension till the end. The final confrontation between Sanders and the kids is outstanding as we watch him trying hard to think of a brick wall that starts to brake and reveal the inside part of the bag on the desk. Although the actor didn't seem to put much effort in his role his talent was enough to present a fine performance.The movie lasts less than 1 hour and 20 minutes but that is enough to deliver the plot and no more is needed. Definitely one of the best sci-fi/horror films I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An Excellent Film Five Decades On</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>At a time when science fiction films were being made mostly with bad scripts, bad actors and even worse production values, there were a handful of science fiction films that were the exact opposite. One of these was 1960's Village Of The Damned. Based on John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos, this tale of a mysterious blacking out of an English village and the more mysterious children born in its wake has becoming something of a genre classic in five decades since it was released. The reasons for this are not hard to see at all thanks to a fine combination of cast, direction, cinematography and script.In some respects a film is only as good as its cast and this film is certainly no exception. George Sanders gives a very believable performance as Professor Gordon Zellaby, the man who finds himself caught more and more in the heart of mysterious events. Barbara Shelly plays his wife Anthea, herself a mother of one of the mysterious children and who finds herself increasingly isolated from that child. Martin Stephens plays Barbara's brother Alan, a military man who stumbles across the mysterious events and becomes linked to it from that point on. Then there's members of the village such as Laurence Naismith as Doctor Willers, Bernard Archard as the local Vicar and others who find themselves baffled and increasingly alarmed by the events around them. Together these actors help to anchor this film with a sense of reality often lost in films of this genre, both then and now.No review of this film would be complete without mentioning the mysterious children of course. Led by child actor Martin Stephens as David, this group of children are amongst the most menacing and odd "monsters" to ever appear in a science fiction film. Notice I use monsters in quotation marks would you? Yes they are children, but at a time when bug eyed monsters were all the rage, Wyndham's novel and the filmmakers took what should have been innocent and made it into a monster of sorts, driven by logic and the need to survive at all costs. With simple looks, coupled with a special effect that looks impressive even fifty years later, they become utterly believable as creatures of menace. The result makes the film all the better not just then, but now as well.Two more ingredients in the film's success are the direction and cinematography. Perhaps taking a cue from Val Guest's direction of the first two Quatermass films, Wolf Rilla choose to direct the film in a very low key way that avoids any of the showier techniques of the time except when its really needed as in the climax of the film. This is coupled with the cinematography of Geoffrey Faithful who shoots the film in a low key, almost pseudo-documentary style that is also very much akin to that seen in the first two Quatermass films. The result is a film that feels realistic even in light of its science fiction events.Which brings us to the script written by Stirling Silliphant, Wolf Rilla and George Barclay. Adapted from John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos the script is a fine example of construction and dialogue being put together brilliantly. From the moment the entire population of the village of Midwich blacks out to the army's investigations of it, there's a mystery in place for the characters (and the viewer) to solve. It is only when the women of Midwich fall pregnant, their children are born and begin towards their appointed destiny that the mystery begins to unravel. As that happens, the film methodically builds in tensions right to the end. All the while though the script reminds us that these are ordinary people caught in the midst of increasingly mysterious events around them thanks both to character moments and the dialogue present throughout. While I can speak to how faithful or unfaithful it is to the original novel, I can say that in either case it is a fine script nevertheless.The only really mixed element found in the film is its score by Ron Goodwin. Goodwin's score is very effective in places, especially in sequences where it is wonderfully timed to the special effect of the "looks" the children give. There are just as many other moments though where the music is utterly out of place, no more so then the heroic march played over the closing credit sequence for example. Consequently, the score ranges continuously between being highly effective or out of place to the point of clashing.Village Of The Damned has become a classic of the science fiction genre all thanks to a fine combination of a great cast, Wolf Rilla's direction, Geoffrey Faithful's cinematography and a fine script. By choosing to be the exact opposite of everything bad science fiction films of the time were, this film still has the power to be every bit as tense and mysterious as it ever has been. That's proved to be even more true some fifty years after its initial release.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>?Cool Britannia", a brick wall and a suicide bomber</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What is absolutely striking about this comparatively short movie is the accomplished stylishness of the blond alien kids. It reminded me spontaneously of the long playing record covers of the 70ies. They are all smartly dressed in a kind of school uniform, sport Beatles haircuts (before anyone even heard about the Beatles) and have a demeanor that expresses nothing but utter disdain born out of a feeling of superiority. They are alien, they are special - they are a threat. Adults, run for cover! It is almost unimaginable that this movie did not have a huge influence on the pop culture that was yet to be born.The main character, played by George Sanders with the ?coolness" of an earlier generation, first shows an active interest in this new brand of children. They could be mutants that bring on a better future, couldn't they? But in the end he looses his calm just like the others, puts a time bomb into his briefcase and fixes his thoughts on a brick wall in the hope that the mind reading kids cannot penetrate this mental barrier and find out about his suicide mission. The movie ends with a bang and is bound to leave an impression with its viewers.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Spooky happenings in Midwich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've seen Village of the Damned a couple of times now and found it very spooky.Life suddenly stops in Midwich for some strange reason, everybody stopping what they are doing wherever they are. Some hours later, everything starts moving again. The strange thing is that most of the women in the village are pregnant. Looks like aliens or something has invaded the village. When the babies are born, they tend to grow quickly and don't seem to be normal. They aren't and these children are aliens and make people kill each other by controlling them. That's when we see their eyes glowing white. Towards the end, Professor Zellaby, whose wife has given birth to one of these little monsters, heads to the place where they are staying with a suitcase full of dynamite...Village of the Damned is shot on location in a English country village, from which you get a sense of a small rural community typical of England.The excellent cast includes several familiar faces: Falcon actor George Sanders, Hammer regular Barbara Shelley (Quatermass and the Pit, Dracula: Prince of Darkness), Laurence Naismith (The Valley of Gwangi, Jason and the Argonauts), Martin Stephens (The Innocents), Michael Gwynn (The Revenge of Frankenstein) and Peter Vaughan (Porridge).Village of the Damned is a good way to spend an hour and a quarter one evening. Very creepy.Rating: 4 stars out of 5.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think I was 7 or 8 years old when I saw this movie by myself at a local theater in Springfield, IL, where I grew up. I don't think the MPAA ratings were in place or enforced when I was allowed in the theater and I think they should have rated it PG-13 and not allowed me in without a parent or older kid to help me keep my sanity.Now, 42 years later, I can still remember two things about Village Of The Damned: those damned eyes, and the damned ending. The children literally scared the bejeezus out of me and I was afraid to walk the 8 blocks home for fear of meeting one or more of these kids. I had nightmares for a couple of weeks, like some of the other commentators here stated they experienced.I was delighted to see that a well-known online DVD rental company actually has the DVDs of this and its sequel in a box set and it is on my list to see very shortly. I just hope I don't have flashbacks of the same terror I experienced during my initial exposure to this psychic masterpiece. My wife and two grown daughters have not seen it. I know it will get to my wife; doesn't take much to get a rise out of her. I just hope my daughters are not too jaded from modern special-effects movies to find this "old-school" B&amp;W flick uninteresting. Personally, I can't wait. BTW, I did see the 1995 re-make and it was OK, but nothing as intrusive in my psyche as the original.</fullReview>

The acting, especially the children, is well done and is highly believable. The costumes, especially the uniforms of the children, lends itself highly to the films believability. I saw this film when it was originally in theaters in the 60s and later several times on television. It is always a pleasure to see this classic. The passage of 40+ years has not diminished this films enjoyability.I firmly believe that had this film been shot in color instead of black &amp; white much of the films effectiveness would be lost.

		<shortDescription>The Sinister Children Of Midwich</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It occurred to me while watching Village Of The Damned that if George Sanders hadn't been talking to his brother-in-law Michael Gwynne an army officer when the mass fainting started, whoever was behind the events in the film might have gotten away with whatever the plan was. As it was they very nearly did.But in fact that's what happens which leads Gwynne down to the typical English country village of Midwich to see why the phone line seemed to go dead midst conversation for no reason. This brings in the military eventually and a cordon of secrecy is put on the events when it seems the whole town within a defined perimeter was given a cosmic Mickey Finn.Even stranger though nine months to the day of the event, several women of child bearing age give birth to some very strange children with blond hair and piercing eyes that turn red with concentration. Barbara Shelley who is Sanders's wife is among those who are impregnated by forces beyond their control or comprehension. These kids herd together and as collective they develop some frightening psychic powers.The most frightening thing about Village Of The Damned is that even with the government closely monitoring the situation the most they do is keep the news of the phenomenon from spreading. Otherwise they are totally helpless to prevent or even stunt what is happening.These children remind of Star Trek's The Borg collective. In fact you have to wonder is this how the Borg got started.Village Of The Damned is a sinister horror picture with a well picked cast giving believable performances of concern and fright. It mixes the horror and science fiction genres quite well. And it's not to be missed when broadcast.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Definite top Sci Fi Classic. Very well made despite showing a low budget. Yes I said it right, George Sanders, our normally upper class Brit bad guy/ Nazi sympathizer in the movies, saves the world as we know it. I just re-screened this fine film tonight for the 5th or so time, and picked up some little things that may have taken this down a notch or so but for a 5th screening to do that still makes this a 10/10. I just noticed how distinguished good Ol Georgie is playing the piano and having his cocktail in his tuxedo right days and hours and even minutes before he goes boom. He is composed because unknown to most viewers there was an alternate ending filmed first. It shows Georgie walking in with the bomb (concealed), and than saying "Oh children I've got to go tinkly winkly", upon which he steps out and sprints on down the road. The bomb is a huge blast and the ending scene has Georgie singing at the piano with his lovely wife sipping his cocktail laughing at how stupid those alien kids were to trust a Nazi sympathizer such as himself. Well, that ending didn't play out well in the tests so they re-shot it but left the rest of the film alone with ol Georgie acting all upper crust with no thought to the impending doom before him. Great film the first, second and even third time you will see it, the sequel is horrible because they ruined the ending of the first and didn't have Georgie to take care of the kids in that one, but thats the way the brick wall crumbles.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A fairly faithful adaptation of John Wyndham's 1957 sci-fi thriller "The Midwich Cuckoos," "Village of the Damned" was released in June 1960. Sporting the admonitory warning "Beware the Stare That Will Paralyze the Will of the World" on its promotional poster, the film was both a critical and popular success...and deservedly so. Beautifully lensed in B&amp;W and featuring highly convincing acting turns down to the smallest bit player, the film works as both intelligent science fiction and suspenseful horror, doling out its shocks strategically and to great effect. Almost 54 years old now, the film still retains its ability to chill the viewer, despite all the cinematic horrors that have come since.In the film, the quaint English village of Midwich (in reality, Letchmore Heath, north of London) is suddenly put to sleep one sunny day by a mysterious force. In what is perhaps the film's most effective sequence, we see the villagers drop in their tracks one by one, including Professor Gordon Zellaby (the great George Sanders) and his pretty, younger wife, Anthea (Barbara Shelley, who would go on to star in many horror films for Hammer Studios). The town remains unconscious for four hours (a whole day, in the source novel), while Anthea's brother, a military officer named Alan Bernard (Michael Gwynn), tries to determine the extent of the affected zone from the outside. Life returns to normal after the mysterious "Time Out," until it is discovered that every woman of childbearing age in Midwich has suddenly become pregnant, to the great consternation of the women and understandable suspicion of the men. When those dozen children (60 in Wyndham's novel) are born on the same day, following a greatly accelerated fetal development, they all seem fairly normal...despite their uniformly blonde hair, unusual fingernails and "arresting eyes." But when the children's advanced development proceeds apace, and they start to evince both a hive mentality and a habit of using lethal mind control to slay anyone who offends them, then even Prof. Zellaby, their staunch defender and a sudden father himself, must question their motives, as the British military ponders a means to destroy them....Besides that bravura opening sequence, during which the town sleeps in eerie silence, "Village of the Damned" features several other well-done segments, as well. Most memorable, perhaps, are the children's attacks, during which, with eyes strangely aglow, they force one man to crash his car into a brick wall, another to kill himself with a shotgun, and still another to turn himself into a human torch. The film ends most impressively as well, with Zellaby's truly heroic actions bringing the story to a memorable close. Those glowing orbs just mentioned are a wonderfully effective special effect; they chilled me as I watched the film for the first time as a full-grown adult, and I can well sympathize with my buddy/film guru Rob, who mentioned that this image frightened him very much when he saw the movie as a child. As in the novel, we never do learn precisely WHY some mysterious agency (extraterrestrials, it is suggested) put the village to sleep and knocked up its womenfolk, or HOW the deed was accomplished (in the book, a spaceship that lands in Midwich serves as definitive proof of alien malfeasance), but that just adds, somehow, to the picture's sense of strangeness and cosmic awe. "Village of the Damned" has been tightly directed by German filmmaker Wolf Rilla (co-author of the script, as well) and boasts some gorgeous outdoor cinematography by Geoffrey Faithful. Shot on a budget of only $225,000, the result looks just fine, and clocking in as it does at a mere 77 minutes, the picture is compact and tight, without a wasted scene or bit of flab. And how nice it is to see George Sanders playing a sympathetic and heroic character here! Sanders, of course, also excelled at portraying any number of acid-tongued rogues, creeps and bounders during his long screen career, as anyone who has seen such films as "Rebecca," "The Ghost and Mrs. Muir" and "All About Eve" will attest. A replacement for the originally slated Ronald Colman (who passed away in 1958, after MGM scrapped its initial plans to produce the film, due to its "scandalous" virgin births), Sanders is simply wonderful here; urbane, sophisticated, and very much the moral center of the story. When his brother-in-law Alan refers to his increasingly odd son's behavior, Zellaby gets to deliver what is perhaps the film's single most effective line: "Anthea's son. I have no proof that he's mine." Literate and adult from beginning to end, "Village of the Damned" is a superior entertainment, and one that was followed, four years later, by an unlikely sequel, "Children of the Damned." And as it turns out, that one is a worthy follow-up--if very much different in feel--to a great original....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf Rilla directed this adaptation of the John Wyndham novel set in the small English town of Midwich, which one day underwent a bizarre occurrence when the entire town went to sleep for several hours, without explanation. Several months later, scientist Gordon Zellaby(played by George Sanders) links the blackouts to the oddity of all women of child-bearing age being pregnant at the same time. The children born all oddly look alike with blond hair and expressionless faces, though with a high intelligence, which includes his wife Anthea(played by Barbara Shelley) and his "son" David(played most effectively by Martin Stephens). Are these children of alien origin, and what is their purpose? Nicely done sci-fi with thoughtful script and good direction. The children are not evil, just different, and how society treats them is as much a reflection on it as it is on them. A bit dry perhaps, but most worthwhile.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Effective little chiller that benefits greatly from the naturalness of the English countryside. The strange children that emerge from this ordinary background achieve a contrast that's really riveting. I expect it's thanks to director Rilla that the kids behave with such an unnerving level of cold detachment. Despite their blond good-looks, they're truly scary. And for a low-budget production, the movie is really well produced?note how convincingly widespread the paralysis of the community appears. Couple that with a lovely Barbara Shelley, a persuasive George Sanders, and an intelligent script bearing a distant relation to 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers, and you've got a real little sleeper. Two points in passing. It's tempting to see an allegory of some kind beneath the text. Like the pod-people of Body Snatchers, these aliens are emotionless, consider humans inferior, and pursue knowledge ostensibly for power. However, they're also blond stereotypes, suggesting perhaps an anti-Nazi message from the recently concluded war. Note too, that the script goes to great lengths in avoiding the use of the term 'pregnant' or any of its synonyms, even though the concept is central to plot development. This seems a curious yet deliberate omission. Was someone in production fearful of audience sensibilities? Be that as it may, the film remains an interesting and inventive little oddity with a different look and feel for its time.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The immaculate deception!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The late John Wyndham is my favourite science fiction author. He is best known for 'The Day Of The Triffids', all about a global invasion by mobile killer plants. The great thing about his stories is that, no matter how far fetched the plots, you feel as though they are credible.His other famous work must be 'The Midwich Cuckoos' which was filmed in 1960 for M.G.M. as 'Village Of The Damned'. It too is about an alien invasion, though not by plants nor fleets of flying saucers spitting death rays. This one is more subtle. The sleepy English village of Midwich experiences a strange phenomenon - its people lose consciousness at exactly the same time. Even animals are affected. Anyone venturing into the area blacks out. The army send in a soldier in a gas mask, but he too collapses. A plane flies over Midwich. The pilot is ordered to lose height, but falls asleep and crashes.When everyone awakes, normality resumes. But something has happened. Months later, every woman of child bearing age is mysteriously pregnant. Their offspring are golden-haired, super-intelligent and possessing strange powers. They are able to force people to do things against their will. When a reckless motorist almost knocks one of them down, for instance, they command him to crash into a wall.Gordon Zellaby ( George Sanders ), a scientist whose wife was impregnated the same way, struggles to find a solution. Similar 'time outs' have occurred in other parts of the world. He works out that aliens are trying to take us over. But how to stop them? 'The Midwich Cuckoos' proved controversial when first published, with some describing it as 'blasphemous' on the account of the similarities between the births of the alien children and the birth of Jesus. But as a science fiction thriller it is second to none. The film, directed and partly written by Wolf Rilla, maintains suspense throughout. It gets a huge boost from Ron Goodwin's score and Tom Howard's special effects. Whenever one of the children uses its powers, their eyes turn pure white! A truly startling ( and unforgettable ) image.There is a strong 'Quatermass' feel to the whole film. Just as an American writer was brought in to shape the material on the 'The Quatermass Experiment' ( Richard Landau in that case ), here Stirling Silliphant ( later to write 'The Towering Inferno' and regrettably 'The Swarm' ) does the honours.Among the children are Lesley and Teresa Scoble, later to appear in the I.T.V. children's sci-fi series 'Timeslip'.Sanders is good as 'Zellaby', with beautiful Barbara Shelley ( later to appear in 'Quatermass &amp; The Pit' ) as wife 'Anthea'. Michael Gwynn portrays their best friend.Four years later, a sequel appeared - 'Children Of The Damned' - starring Ian Hendry, and in 1995 John Carpenter remade 'Village' ( not particularly well ) with the late Christopher Reeve in the Sanders role.'Village' proved hugely influential, as 'The Omen' testified sixteen years later.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The film Hitchcock might have made had he turned to science fiction</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sci-fi was never a great forte of the British film industry, although there were occasional exceptions. It was often left to Hollywood to make adaptations of works by classic British science fiction writers such as H.G. Wells ("The Invisible Man", "The War of the Worlds", "The Time Machine") and John Wyndham ("The Day of the Triffids"). "Village of the Damned", based upon Wyndham's "The Midwich Cuckoos" should also have been an American film, but MGM, who had acquired the film rights to the novel, shelved the project, fearing that the mysterious, unexplained pregnancies which form a vital part of the plot could be taken as a comment on the Christian doctrine of the Virgin Birth. The film was therefore made in Britain after all, although by a German director, Wolf Rilla. It was shot on location in the village of Letchmore Heath, Hertfordshire, although the precise geographical coordinates given place the fictitious village of Midwich in Hampshire, just outside the real village of Woodmancott. (Letchmore Heath was frequently used as a film set due to its proximity to Elstree Studios). As the movie opens, all of the inhabitants of the village suddenly fall unconscious. They regain consciousness some time later, seemingly unaffected, but after about two months all the women of childbearing age in the village are discovered to be pregnant. They all give birth on the same day to a strange set of children. Although these children are beautiful, with striking eyes and platinum-blonde hair, they grow up to be quite unlike normal children. They are physically and intellectually precocious, developing at a much faster rate than normal children. It becomes clear that they have telepathic bond with one another and the power to read the thoughts and control the minds of others. On the other hand they lack any normal human emotions including love and affection. The leading character is Professor Gordon Zellaby, a scientist who lives in the village and whose wife Anthea is the mother of one of the children. Zellaby is summoned to a meeting with the Home Secretary and senior members of the Intelligence Service to discuss the children. Some of those present, including Zellaby's brother-in-law Alan Bernard, feel that the sinister children present a threat and should be destroyed, but Zellaby himself, who believes that their intellectual potential can be used for the good of mankind persuades the committee that they should be saved. The children are placed in a separate building where they will live and where Zellaby will act as their teacher. The experiment fails, however, as despite their intellectual prowess the children appear to lack any moral sense. After they use their powers to kill a number of villagers who have crossed them, even Zellaby is forced to conclude that they are evil and must be destroyed. Whether the children actually are "evil", any more than a wild animal is evil, is debatable. To be evil one must understand the concept of morality but nevertheless deliberately act in an immoral way, whereas the children seem to have no conception of right and wrong. It is, however clear that they are hostile to humanity and represent a threat to it. Exactly where they come from is never made clear, but Wyndham's use of the word "Cuckoos" in his title implies that they are alien beings from another world, seeking to take over the Earth in the same way as a cuckoo takes over other birds' nests. One of the things that makes the film so unnerving is that these creatures take the form of human children, normally a symbol of innocence. A sequel, "Children of the Damned", followed in 1963, but I have never rated it as highly as the original film. "Children of the Damned" appears to have been made as an allegorical film of ideas, but it is so muddled that whatever message it may contain goes missing somewhere along the way. "Village of the Damned", by contrast, is simply a science fiction thriller. It was made on a small budget with only one established star, George Sanders, in the cast. (Barbara Shelley, who plays Anthea, was later to become famous as a Hammer "scream queen"). There are no special effects other than the glowing eyes of the children. And yet it has become a classic of the British cinema, and in my view the greatest British science-fiction film ever. (Probably its nearest rival would be "Quest for Love", also based upon a Wyndham story). At only 77 minutes the running time is very short, even by the standards of low-budget British movies from the early sixties. This concision, however, is precisely part of what makes the film so good. The story moves at a brisk pace and develops clearly and logically, with a growing sense of tension and urgency. The final, unbearably tense, scene, is a great directorial set-piece worthy of Alfred Hitchcock. This is perhaps the film that Hitchcock would have made had he turned his attention to sci-fi. 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Village of the Damned" rivals the original "Invasion of the Body Snatchers" as one of the seminal horror/ sci-fi classics in the period BG (Before Gore). This tightly directed, economically told tale about a crop of alien children who cause havoc in a small, English town entertains through the sheer relentlessness of its narrative. Not a lot of character development here, but the great George Sanders leads a professional Brit cast in a battle of wills and glowing yellow eyeballs against their mysterious alien/ Aryan offspring. Worth watching. It may not terrify you but it has more on its mind than many recent Hollywood horror flicks like the execrable "Hannibal."</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A great horror movie if you like them</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is my favorite horror movie: past Psycho, past The Birds. Its only flaw is that they did not retain the story title "The Midwich cuckoos." George Sanders gives an unbelievable performance in a movie that might not have attracted such a distinguished actor. The ending is a shock that will leave you reeling. A key aspect of the movie is the demon nature of the children, a theme often repeated in later movies to lesser effect. How the director got them to act so hauntingly I'll never know. And I hope those poor kids did not suffer from playing the roles the way other child actors sometimes did. In contrast to sf/fantasy/horror scenarios that are difficult to buy into because they make explicit things that are obviously impossible, think about the subtle understatement of this movie. The world never expected the atomic bomb or AIDS either.As usual, the re-make with Chris Reed doesn't quite get the point. The children in that film literally do in graphic detail what Sanders only implies that they will do (bring in soldiers and the children will make them shoot each other). There are both more horrible manifestations of the children's powers in the remake and a mitigation of them that doesn't make sense (one of them is "nice"). No--go to the original, because true horror must have an element of subtlety and internal logic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Despite a strong adult cast it's the children who deliver the goods here. They seem to relish their roles as much as any child would relish watching this film. After all, this is a tale about kids having power over adults - a notion that forms the very core of the horror. The second half is stronger than the first as the children (freakish in their black garb and blonde wigs) assume control of their own lives, forming their own school-based community. And there's some great cinematography to watch along the way, especially during the gun-suicide scene. Close-ups of the children as they take control of a villager and force his gun into his mouth are truly chilling, and should go down as some of the scariest movie shots of all time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Filmed over a period of six weeks on a shoestring budget, Village of the Damned is proof positive that you don't need mega-millions to make a million dollar movie.*****************Major Spoiler Alert********************** In an English village, every living thing falls into a coma for about three hours. No explanation is given for this phenomenon, and about two months later, every woman of child-bearing age gives birth to children who are clearly not normal. With their telekinetic powers and blazing eyes (the only "gimmick" in the film,) they take out any of the villagers they perceive as a threat to their survival. Gordon Zellaby, (George Sanders), the father of one of the little fiends, takes matters into his own hands with the help of a brick wall and a few sticks of dynamite.As for the performances, they are top notch. George Sanders plays a kindly school teacher who tries to reason with the alien children, no small feat, since they can read the minds of anyone within reach. One can't help but compare his character to that of Van Helsing in Bela Lugosi's "Dracula", being the only one able to stare down, and eventually destroy the threat to mankind.Barbara Shelly,(who, speaking of Dracula, was to become one of his "brides" in "Dracula, Prince of Darkness" a few years later)portrays Gordon's wife, and the mother of David Zellaby, the head creep (played to perfection by young Martin Stephens,perhaps the finest British child actor of that era). His portrayal as David, who betrays no emotion throughout-except for a hint of terror at the moment he realizes that he and his alien brood are about to be blown to smithereens-is stand-alone.The screenplay and directing, by Sterling Silliphant and Wolf Rilla, respectfully, make this a true sci-fir/horror classic. Like "Horror Hotel" and "Mr. Sardonicus", both of which came out at about the same time, there is a claustrophobic feel which adds to the overall tension.If you're looking for a thriller with intelligence, this is a must-see.***** out of *****</fullReview>

		<fullReview>All of the women of child-bearing age in the sleepy English town of Midwich suddenly find themselves "with child" in this low budget but superbly handled screen adaptation of John Wyndham's "The Midwich Cuckoos". The babies, upon birth, develop very rapidly into blonde-haired children with amazing - and horrifying - mental powers. The effects - what there are of them - are used VERY sparingly, and this adds to the film's creepiness. George Sanders, Laurence Naismith, et al., all execute their roles flawlessly and with a veddy British flavor. As previously mentioned, this is a low-budget thriller and the effects are, well, low-budget, but this is not and should not be considered a handicap as it now forces the director and the actors to do their jobs and be a cut above. We've said it before and we'll say it again: effects are a useful adjunct - key word:ADJUNCT - but should not be allowed to become the movie. When used judiciously and with restraint, they can enhance a good film and make it a great film, but cannot substitute for competant direction, a good script, or good acting (exs: "Starship Troopers", "Star Trek: The Motion Picture"). Examples of this principle are too numerous to name, but a good one would be a "Twilight Zone" episode titled "The Last Night of a Jockey". "Nervous Man in a Four Dollar Room" is also an excellent choice. But, we digress. "Village of the Damned" is superb gothic horror, and scared the bejeezus out of us when we first saw it way back when. Of the two films with the same name, this is the one to see; DO NOT waste your time or money on the awful John Carpenter remake.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dark and chilling killer-kid effort</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After a series of strange births in a small English village, the progeny of the births grow into children with a highly-advanced IQ and deadly telekinetic powers that are used to bend others to their will, eventually forcing the town to rid themselves of the children.This was quite a fun and enjoyable effort here with some pretty positive points. Among the biggest elements here is in how this one really tends to utilize their powers, which here come from rather glaring examples of their inhumanness and otherworldly nature that doesn't strike anyone as being odd at all but rather as a freak of nature to be studied. The very first instance of watching the two-year-old versions master a complicated Chinese mystery box as they do in mere seconds despite being shown the contraption for the first time at that very point should've been a massive clue something is going on, while the opening village-wide blackout here and subsequent deluge of births without conception being another sterling example of this here, and the incidents with the neighborhood pets and children simply furthers the case considerably as it's becoming obvious here that something's wrong with them. Those display scenes are quite fun, as are the attempts by the military to get things reigned in being quite fun as the military shootout amongst themselves while under the children's control makes for a fine action scene as well as a creepy display of their chilling powers. There's a lot of that throughout here and it's quite fun to get it all in here with these scenes as the displayed group powers do have a rather chilling air here in regards to how they manage to force this upon others while also managing to come off as creepy villains for doing this. Beyond this, there's also a rather fine opening here as this one manages to make fine use of the town's blackout and subsequent reactivation that occurs without any warning or reason, and the scenes of them attempting to gain entrance to the town results in a rather chilling proposition and some fine action scenes here of the town under those conditions which is quite a shocking opening here. These, though, are all more than enough to hold off the films' few small problems. The biggest issue here is the opening town blackout, which is such a monumental and completely thrilling event in the history of the nation that to not follow-up on it and just dismiss the people as easily here makes no sense. Even more likely, the fact that this one manages to keep how they got pregnant as they did a total mystery is another big reason why this incident should've been handled a bit differently, as this one beats around the bush of that factor so much that this as well becomes something of a problem area. The last problem here is the films' handling of the children themselves, as while this one does a great job at making them creepy it's so obvious from the beginning that something is wrong here that no further action or inquisition against them following the events that happened beforehand is entirely puzzling, as this should've been the final nail in the coffin to examine the incidents at the beginning and becomes quite problematic because of that. Otherwise, this one was quite fun overall.Today's Rating/PG: Violence and violent acts against children.</fullReview>

I also like the implied divide of emotions versus logic. This is a theme that would come up again in "Star Trek" and then "Star Trek: The Next Generation". Do emotions inhibit the way we reason, or do they add something that pure logic cannot see?

		<fullReview>Having watched (and admittedly skipping through bits of) the awful 1995 Village of the Damned, I decided to re-watch the 1960 version. I recall seeing it when I was in my teens and recall it as something both classy and compulsively eerie at the same time. Does it still hold up three decades later?It does. It is in some ways a typical B-movie, and I suspect that was the producers' and director's intention, but somehow the cast, story and screenplay work magic with each other and lift the production to another level. This is very much the zenith of the director's career. Wolf Rilla was a Jewish refugee from Nazi Germany who started off working with the BBC before having a go a film-making. While never producing anything terrible, he could not be accused of being in the upper echelons of film director circles. After spawning a number of more forgettable productions and a spell back in television, he retired to manage a hotel in France.There are some curiously familiar faces, although no A-list actors, such as George Sanders, more famous as the voice of Shere Khan in Disney's The Jungle Book. His wife is played by Barbara Shelley who went on to become a pillar of the British Hammer House of Horror scene. This is the kind of film that you can happily watch again for the pleasure of seeing how many 1950s character actors you can spot.So, a quality film, but perhaps more by accident than intention. Incidentally, the lead girl amongst the strange children is June Cowell, sister of Simon Cowell. After a very short career, she purposefully ditched film work for family life, stating she's never had a single regret and wishes her illustrious brother could find the same happiness she has.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think this is one of the most effective sci-fi horrors I have seen and multiple times already. Monsters and the likes might be visually terrifying while these kids seem harmless. But the abilities they have are what is really scary. And I don't mean just their glowing hypnotizing eyes. They can read minds, have some kind of multiple brain, learn and develop much faster than all other kids. Where they come from is never revealed nor how all the women capable of childbirth in Midwich were impregnated. And how only every living being in Midwich and not beyond the borders passed out remains a mystery too. The scene where we see all people and animals of Midwich pass out and life literally stops for a few hours is really nice piece of cinematography. Also the research that people (army mostly) from outside try to do is one of my favorite parts. It might be that the novel reveals more but I haven't had the courage to go through that yet. I guess the movie captures the book's title "Midwich Cuckoos" quite nicely. These birds lay their eggs in the nest of others. So the cuckoo's children are raised by other birds who are not their parents. Exact the same happens here. The fear the Midwich people develop is very real and understandable they would like to wipe them all out. The Cuckoo children don't hesitate to punish anyone who seems wanting to do them harm or disadvantage them. They are not troubled by feelings and emotions like humans are. That's why they will always be a step ahead unless someone studying them finds a solution. We have some great leads in George Sanders and Barbara Shelley as Mr and Mrs Zellaby. But the real star is Martin Stephens who plays David Zellaby, leader of the cuckoo children gang. One year later he would again do a masterful job portraying Miles in The Innocents.</fullReview>

The eerie goings-on are beautifully understated, and the horrors that stem from the minds of the alien-begat brats seem all the more shocking as a consequence. The final scenes, wherein Sanders tries to maintain the facade that will enable him to deal once and for all with the brats, are among some of the greatest in the history of Fright Films. For fans who can appreciate solid storytelling and good, imaginative drama, it doesn't get much better than VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED. (With the notable exceptions of the original STAR TREK and THE X FILES, we haven't had very much in the way of truly QUALITY Fantastic Fiction on television since the premature demise of THE OUTER LIMITS- the original series-; maybe it's time someone produced another black and white anthology series for the Small Screen.

		<fullReview>When I got my driver's license, my sister and I went to a nearby town to see this movie. It was frightening and thought provoking. Seeing it again, it has not lost much of its effect. The children, who seem docile and unassuming, are our worst nightmare. Because they are "children," the same steps to stifle any other threat to our well being are shelved. George Sanders' character is the one who knows that if we are to allow emotion to guide our feet, we are doomed. It would seem that an alien race, bent on destruction of a world, would use our emotional attachment to offspring. The miraculous births, which initially cause huge problems, should have been a warning sign. Even in the end, Sanders must truly act alone since telepathy is an issue and any mind transfer from him would upset the apple cart. This is a well done and disturbing movie, and I've always loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't often say this with horror films, but for me the 1995 John Carpenter version of Village of the Damned will always be my favorite. That being said, this 1960's British classic, which stays more to the novel's side, is still a very entertaining and horrific little movie that dares to ask the question: are we as humans really as advanced as we think? Or to a higher species, would we just be considered in the way? In the English small town of Midwich, a strange events occurs when all the residents within the town limits pass out for several hours. This draws attention from scientists and the government, and when every woman in town ends up pregnant, the offspring are less than friendly. Each child is blonde, dresses professionally if not incredibly boring, and they share telepathy as well as a mind controlling ability that is highly destructive. At first scientists thought these children were mutants caused by some man-made industrial accident or virus... but are they perhaps not of this world? Slightly outdated but still highly enjoyable, Village of the Damned is not so much scary as it is disturbing. These children view humans the way we view cows, to be used and then disposed of when no longer wanted. It's in black and white, but has recently been released in full color, although if you appreciate the authentic feel, stick with the black and white version. It doesn't have the thrilling and eerie soundtrack or scenery that the John Carpenter version does, but the children are just as creepy. They walk in unison, talk like robots and have little respect for the humans in their life.I honestly recommend the entire collection. Check out this one, along with its sequel, Children of the Damned. Check out the 1995 Americanized John Carpenter version, and the novel as well. No matter which version you decide you like best, the concept of the creepy alien children is universal.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Wolf Rilla's "Village of the Damned" is a testament to what horror can be without gore and CGI. One of the many movies focusing on children who aren't as innocent as they seem (think "The Bad Seed" and "The Omen"), it does everything perfectly. The children's eyes are enough to freak anyone out. John Carpenter's remake was OK, not great; it's most notable aspect is that star Christopher Reeve had his paralyzing injury around the time of the release. The original is easily the better one. You're sure to love it.And remember, think of a wall! PS: A "Simpsons" episode depicted a movie called "The Bloodening", an obvious parody of this movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Midwich is a rural British community that experiences an inexplicable phenomena: for several hours, the entire population fall unconscious; when they eventually come round, every woman able to bear a child is pregnant. The children borne of this strange event?all blonde with strange eyes?develop at an accelerated rate and display supernatural abilities. Emotionless, ruthless and deadly, they grow to pose a threat, not just to the people of Midwich, but the whole world and must be destroyed?but how do you hide the truth from children who can read your mind and kill with a thought?Very few malevolent movie moppets have been quite as sinister as the blonde haired, glowing eyed kids in Village of the Damned, one of the earliest horrors to depict children as a force of evil, and still one of the best. Based on the novel ' The Midwich Cuckoos' by John Wyndham, this low budget classic of British horror's strength lies not in showy special effects but in excellent writing, effective direction and perfectly nuanced performances, with the child actors just as brilliant as their adult counterparts (so many similarly themed films are let down by their unconvincingly threatening sprogs). The gripping narrative is primarily driven by dialogue and subtle moments of terror, but the film is not without its occasionally more horrific scenes, including a couple of violent deaths inflicted upon villagers by the killer kids: a man is forced to crash his car into a brick wall and another is made to set himself on fire.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Great Work of British Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is a great British horror film based on the novel The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham. It combines an eerie atmosphere with good direction and a fine lead performance by George Saunders to produce a classic work of sci-fi horror.The film's eerie opening is a masterpiece in its own right. A town's entire population collapses into unconsciousness as a church bell tolls ominously over the titles. Rather than fast forwarding to explore the more explicit horror that comes afterward, the film examines the discovery of the phenomenon and the official response, thereby increasing the mystery and suspense. Then, just as mysteriously as they passed out, the town's citizens awaken.Soon after, all the town's women find they are pregnant. The film explores the social implications of these mass pregnancies, and the suspicion they breed within the town. When the children are born, they turn out to be more than human, with dangerous telepathic powers. One element that distinguishes the film is that the children are not presented as necessarily evil. Although they ultimately serve as the antagonists, their actions are largely in self-defense, against people who abuse them or mean them harm. Indeed, the children ultimately rebel in large part because of the townspeople's hostility.Furthermore, George Saunders is good as the children's teacher. He brings the character a dignity one generally doesn't see in horror films. He avoids the overt ham that too many horror leads adopt. Taken together, all these elements come together to make a great movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fantastic social statement</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I've always seen this film as more of a social statement than just a science fiction movie. In the early 1960s the younger generation, which had always seemed somewhat passive, suddenly started to seriously rebel (this film was made only a few years after Rebel Without A Cause). It speaks to the fear of the older generation who could no longer control their children, it presages the drug era and the total defiance of authority(which truly began with the JFK assassination in 1963). As an aside, in the late 1950s it suddenly became possible for women whose husbands were infertile to have children with anonymous sperm donors, and this film also speaks to those men whose wives are biologically connected to their children while they themselves are not, men who may have had misgivings and could not voice them. George Saunders was terrific in the film, quite a departure from the sarcastic, slightly smarmy characters he usually played.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Village of the Damned</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is a spooky and dark 1960 British thriller. One day, everyone living in a small village fall unconscious. The reason is a mystery to outsiders and medical doctors. All of a sudden, the people regain consciousness and don't remember being out cold. Some time passes when some of the women in the village become pregnant. Problem is, most of them don't know how that could have happened. For example, a 17 year old became pregnant after the incident, yet she had never had sex. The children are eventually born after a few weeks instead of the normal nine months. As they grow at a rapid pace, they are shown to be remarkably intelligent. Moreso then the average child at their age.Pretty soon it is apparent to viewers and the townsfolk that these kids are evil and have the power to read peoples minds. If they feel like they're in danger at any time, they can also use mind control to kill that person putting them in harms way. The clever and unique thing about Village of the Damned is that the children sometimes tell us what the people are thinking and what they are going to say before we actually get to hear it. It works very well in this film.The ending is kind of bittersweet. Sad, but in a way satisfying for this kind of movie. And of course, it leaves the door open for a potential sequel. I liked Village of the Damned a lot. It didn't go into too much detail regarding how the children came to be and things like that. The movie would have felt a little dull I think had they gone into so much detail and explanations. The kids are very creepy, especially the main child David. Check it out.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Strange how nobody seems to remember John Wyndham any more. Triffids was never a good book to make into a movie really, but The Midwich Cuckoos definitely works. And here's the version to prove it. Generally well cast and a good sample of low budget British Cinema that takes the story seriously and does an excellent job of building tension. As in the book, the origin of the "episode" in Midwich is left to the viewer, and the film makers do a very fine job of using silence and still shots to convey the weirdness. Children are suitably creepy, echoing the book very well. And we even get the spooky kid (Martin Stephens) who was in The Innocents with Deborah Kerr, made the following year.A gem.Now if only someone would option The Chrysalids....

		<shortDescription>Creepy, Eerie, Creepy and... CREEPY</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Doubtlessly one of the most magnificent classics of British Sci-Fi Horror, Wolf Rilla's "Village of the Damned" of 1960 is a film that includes some of the eeriest moments ever brought to screen. An adaptation of John Wyndham's novel "The Midwich Cuckoos", "Village of the Damned" treats the timeless and always creepy 'eerie children'-theme, and it does so in a very creepy and effective manner.One day, the English village of Midwich is infested with a mysterious force. The villagers fall into trance and, as if it was protected by invisible walls, the area cannot be accessed from outside. The trance the ends as suddenly as it began. The mysterious force has left its marks however - all women of Midwich are suddenly pregnant... Some years later, the children who were the result of this intrusion behave in a somewhat eerie manner, and are therefore stigmatized by most of the other villagers. The more hostile the environment reacts to them, the more hostile the children seem to get...The topic of 'eerie kids' is always creepy and somewhat shocking, and has been successfully brought to screen on several occasions. This classic is probably the most famous and influential 'eerie kids' film there is, and my personal second-favorite after Narciso Ibá?ez Serrador's Spanish masterpiece "?Quién puede matar a un ni?o?" (aka. "Island of the Damned", 1976), which is positively one of the most terrifying films ever made. The great British character actor George Sanders delivers an excellent performance as the reasonable, responsible and mild-mannered adult, Dr. Zellaby. His significantly younger wife is played by the beautiful Barbara Shelley, who was the sexy female star of several other British Horror films, including the Hammer classics "Dracula: Prince of Darkness", "The Gorgon", "Rasputin: The Mad Monk" and "Quatermass and the Pit". The true stars of this film, however, are the kids: The children, and especially their creepy, CREEPY eyes, are responsible for some sequences that are incomparably eerie and simply unforgettable. Naming every single child actor is pointless (though they would definitely deserve it. Then 12-year-old Martin Stephens, who plays the boy Dr. Zellaby's wife has given birth to, is great, as are all the other kids in their roles. "Village of the Damned" is amazingly filmed and guarantees a fascinating and very suspenseful experience from the first minute to the end. This is one of the greatest British Sci-Fi Horror classics, and I would not hesitate to call it easily en par with Hammer's "Quatermass" cycle. A must-see for all fans of Horror, Science Fiction, and lovers of classic cinema.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>An ingenious set-up for a thriller...let down a bit by talk and a tight budget</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Wolf Rilla directed this expert thriller from John Wyndham's novel "The Midwich Cuckoos", coming up with pretty stylish returns on such a tight budget. The mystery begins one day in the small British village of Midwich: all the residents are rendered unconscious for nearly four hours by an unseen substance which, three months down the road, results in pregnancies in every of-age female in town. When the babies are born, they are extraordinarily healthy and intelligent, paving the way for some scary behavior once the kids reach school-age. These tykes are the most exasperating little prigs imaginable, yet Professor George Sanders (himself the 'father' of one of the boys) is the only man unafraid of them--and perhaps the only one who can stop their path of destruction. Rilla doesn't overload the picture with nonsense; his narrative is clean-cut and the pacing is quick. Still, there's the usual leaden discussion-phase, wherein the adults have to formulate a plan which we in the audience know will soon be rendered moot. Sanders isn't really into his role, though he plays along rather splendidly, and the child actors have amazing faces. We don't get a sense of how many extraordinary children there should actually be however, and the pack of spooky towheads keeps changing in size. Followed by a sequel, "Children of the Damned", in 1964; remade by John Carpenter in 1995. *** from ****</fullReview>

"they aren't human and must be destroyed". ya right. so if you had the power to induce a shotgun bearing bumpkin to blow his own head off after aiming it at you and your friends, what would you do? I wish I had the power when I was a kid to turn the bullies on themselves. I would have killed them all without hesitation. but in the humaaaahn dominated world, violence aggression, weapons, force and power win the day every time. these kids are just using their collective gift to fend for themselves. the military is bent on wiping them out, their counterparts in other parts of the world are killed in their cribs, and a brat feels free to bounce a soccer ball off the girl's head. a TOTALLY unprovoked attack. maybe one day the instant reflex hostility will be a thing of the past. I say kill all the bullies whenever you have the chance. then go on living your life peacefully and with your own kind or whoever wishes to do likewise. it begins by killing the bullies and expunging the worst of humaaaahn nature from your environment. kill them all. anyone who commits an unprovoked and unwarranted attack deserves instant death. including the so-called 'good guys'.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Effectively understated supernatural thriller</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I recently finished reading "The Midwich Cuckoos" by John Wyndham, the novel upon which this film and the 1995 John Carpenter film were based, and had a strangely ambivalent reaction to it. I did ultimately enjoy it, but definitely thought it undeserving of its reputation, and was disappointed in how it constantly distanced itself from the Children actually doing anything strange. It's no fun reading others talking about them, I want to actually read about them. That little really happened in a slow-paced novel which takes place over nearly a decade didn't help me finish it any faster, although it is quite short compared to a lot of what I read. Naturally, I was afraid that I would have a similar reaction to this much-loved 1960 film.I needn't have feared. A film which takes the best bits of the novel and packs them into 77 minutes devoid of filler (and it thankfully cuts out the stupid and pointless politics shoe-horned into the novel), a film which actually has better characterization than its source material does (although the dialogue is not quite as good as Wyndham's), as well as a bunch of good performances and a nice, understated quality which works in favor of the film is naturally going to be more enjoyable than several hours spent reading something you're not especially interested in. It's kind of like a feature-length British version of "The Twilight Zone" in concept and execution. Really effective.The Children are creepy (and the kid who played David is really good!), the special effects competent, the direction by Wolf Rilla is good, and I also liked the score by well-known film composer Ron Goodwin (also known for "Frenzy", "When Eagles Dare", and "The Day of the Triffids" among others). Just a really solid, lean 77 minute long thriller which is recommended to anyone looking for something fun to watch when there's a storm raging outside, and really one of the smartest adaptations of a novel I've ever seen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful and Much-Imitated Sci-fi Film, Well Acted and Interesting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Science fiction is, I assert, difficult to write well; unlike many other genres of "fiction", it requires some imagination, a strong ability to relate characters to values, and a ruthless logic. "Village of the Damned", adapted, by Stirling Silliphant, the film's director Wolf Rilla and George Barclay, from the famous novel by John Wyndham "The Midwich Cuckoos" is often an absorbing film. It never, in my judgment, establishes enough of a reality of English life against which to set the presence of the film's aliens. These are children; ordinary looking children, who are super-intelligent, have psychic powers and whose eyes glow gold. One cannot discuss this film's eerie story line without disclosing too much of its evolving direction; suffice it to say that one day, strange occurrences happen in a number of countries: everyone blacks out for four hours in the small town of Midwich England as elsewhere, the setting being the one for the British whose fortunes we follow. As a result of these happenings, every fertile female in town--married or not--gives birth to an odd child--strange, to say the least, but blond-haired and human in a full sense by every appearance. The central characters of the film are an older couple played by Barbara Shelley, who is beautiful and very professionally sympathetic in her role; George Sanders also does quite well in the part of an understanding teacher who demands that the children be taught ethics and tries to do the job himself; thus he becomes the children's professor. The alternative is a plot to kill all the children, the military's position-to safeguard the country's populace. Others prominently featured in the steady but not stellar cast include fine actor Laurence Naismith, Richard Warner and Rosamund Greenwood. The plot moves the participants from shock, to curious acceptance of the strange offspring, to fear and then beyond at a surprisingly good pace, I suggest. Ron Goodwin's usual musical contribution is very successful indeed, aiding the atmosphere of the film. Cinematography was by Geoffrey Faithful with consistent Art Direction by Ivan King and convincing special effects by Tom Howard. The taut and moving first half of the film seems to me as a writer a bit rushed in the second portion of the work; However, this very influential film--whose effects, ideas and setting have been copied many times since, stands on its own. It has some very good actors, a straightforward development and two leads who are world class--plus a very logical and memorable ending. This is a taut and often literate black-and-white sci-fi film that can be watched more than once, I suggest.</fullReview>

I saw this movie when it was first released, and it has remained one of my favorites. I just received the DVD and it is really very good. Think of this movie in the "we fear our children" mold of the Omen movies. While the latter is much more violent, and couched in biblical terms, somewhat dubiously for the latter Omens, Village is considerably more elegant. Also I do not find the children frightening. They are "different." That is the same problem explored in the X-Men films. And they are scared themselves, of extinction. The movie shows xenophobia in full tilt. But it also demonstrates the over-reaction that children have to threats. It has all these issues in 117 minutes. Quite an achievement</fullReview>

The babies come out all looking like little goths, wearing black, white-blond hair. They have a mental community amongst themselves, when one devil kid learns something they all do, and they communicate telepathically. They are scary because they can control people's minds, and make them commit suicide. There's the wacko military that wants to kill them, the professor who naively wants to study them and use them for good, and the small boy with glowing eyes that makes a guy shoot himself. Most were downplayed, which was the strongest point of the film. Everyone was very British; ie. they are calm and polite, even when discussing small satanic kiddies. The lack of melodrama saves it and makes it a little more intelligent than it could have been.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I think that this is a very good film. To begin with, who can resist George Sanders' voice?!! Also, I liked the outdoor filming at the beginning very much. It had a good realistic quality. The indoor scenes were also good --- except for George Sanders' study which looked like a studio set for "Father Knows Best". The story was quite strange, but seems to me to be in the mainstream of what I call the British universal doom genre --- as in "Day of the Triffids", "The Wind from Nowhere", and "The Eternal Winter (?)". (As far as I know, the last two are books only.) This was also a pretty stripped down and Spartan film. What is spooky about it is how the affectless children provide a good portrayal of the coldness of the "outside" enemy. In fact, I think that the pretty bare story-line is strong enough to overcome a couple of ineptitudes --- e.g., telling the pilot to fly low carefully with predictable results (!) and the burning cardboard house at the end. One thing that is not developed is the theme of maternity --- the mothers of the children do not figure very much in the story. A lot could have been done with that theme. But perhaps the "absence" of the mothers highlights the complete alien quality of the children. I recommend this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The opening sequence of this film was the proof that I was going to enjoy it. The bodies of every living creature in the village, lying limp and lifeless throughout the village. (When I first saw the film I thought they were dead, but....) There are bodies in the middle of the street, bodies in vehicles, a woman lies limp on the floor as her iron burns her clothing, while a magnetophone skips as it plays and slowly dies to a stop. This is a wonderful prelude to a mysterious plot that is not entirely revealing until almost the very end. The pressure of the mystery is also stressful for the characters as they try to figure out the horror that is knocking the adults unconcious, thus adding to the emotion of the film. Altogether a great mystery classic (though not a horrifying film, in my opinion) with some creepy parts. A sort of subtle way of saying, "Watch out for the little people." I give it an 8 out of 10 (considering the time it was made)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As you may know, this is a film of British SF author John Wyndham's book "The Midwich Cuckoos". The Wyndham trademarks of "jolly decent people having jolly beastly things happening to them" are all apparent, and translate very well to the screen. However, the other Wyndham trademark of serious philosophical thought and social commentary is almost entirely ignored. Without this philosophical context, the ending in particular is a let-down and a cop-out, whereas in the book it was a shocking, but totally logical and indeed necessary finale - the preceding chapters make it clear that this is the only possible outcome. The film's ending's impact is also reduced by the way the scene is done in the film.However, this is not to say that this is a bad film in any way. The tension is excellently built up, and there are some great performances. The kids are truly scary. Incomparably better than that other Wyndham adaptation, "The Day of the Triffids".</fullReview>

		<fullReview>John Wyndham has been an extremely under-utilised source of science-fiction movie potential. His most famous 'Day Of The Triffids' was a typical British-made low-budget disaster. Way ahead of its time in contemplating the potentially dire consequences of genetic engineering and orbital weapons, it is surely ripe for a good quality remake using modern special effects.Village of the damned, however, requires no such treatment. This was his 'Midwich Cuckoos' and as no monsters had to be mocked-up and as it only affected a small, isolated English village instead of the whole world, no special effects were necessary and the director and his budget could concentrate on story, acting and script.This is exactly what the movie does. Watching it today is like watching an old black &amp; white newsreel of something that happened 40-odd years ago.I am not a great fan of the oleaginous George Sanders, but he does excellent work in this starring role. Everyone else fits in to a tee. The hamlet of 'Midwich' is inexplicably stricken by unconsciousness. Its entire population is affected. There is no going in or out. An over-flying plane is brought down when its pilot succumbs. A tethered soldier wearing a gas-mask collapses at some predetermined threshold and has to be dragged back, whereupon he recovers. The quarantine is that specific. Then, after a few hours, everything seems normal. People get up and go about their business. But something fundamental has happened. All the fertile women have conceived. The shock and shame of single women and virgin girls as well as housewives suddenly, inexplicably pregnant is captured with great fidelity. And later, as their collectively strange brood quickly grow, and grow to resemble each other and apart from everyone else, Wyndham's profoundly intelligent grasp of human nature is accurately reflected, as is his disturbing idea.The children are truly the product of some immaculate alien conception. They are blonde-haired, blank-faced, and for the most part unemotional. They are also psychic. You can't afford to think ill of them and have them catch you at it. Some villagers do, and die for their trouble.Sanders plays Professor Zellaby. He's a member of the community and by far its brightest resident. The foremost child was borne by his wife. He strikes-up a rapport with the group. But it is evident that from their standpoint his is an association of convenience. In time, even he realises that there can only be one solution, and having their trust, he the only one who can effect it. They have a plan. Humanity does not feature in it very highly.There have been re-makes, but original is best in this case. See it, if you get the chance. Small budget and very limited special effects can still render a very scary little film when the the material is handled sympathetically.Actually, I have always felt that Wyndham's best scarer was his little known 'The Kraken Wakes'. Today it would make a tremendous large-scale cinematic frightener - again, if handled correctly. Read the book and see what you think. But see this little classic, too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The mix and match of suspense and modesty</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here begins my 200th review for the IMDb. And I've chosen Village of the Damned. VOTD doesn't have the grandeur of some SF/horror classics like Invasion of the Body Snatchers or The Day The Earth Stood Still. But it is a superb, very paranoid film. Its well deserving of classic status. And all the more effective for its modest approach.Based on John Wyndham's novel The Midwich Cuckoos, I'm told VOTD is a very faithful adaptation. It was originally going to be filmed in America, before the Catholic Legion of Decency objected, perhaps because of its themes of abortion (only implied, never spoken), teenage pregnancy, and deaths of several children. Perhaps its for the best the film was transplanted to the UK, because not only is it in keeping with the novel, but the story may have been swallowed up in the US, and lost a lot of the qualities that made it such a daring film for its time.Village of the Damned is a tightly plotted, snappily paced horror film. What makes it so horrific is the fact that it takes place within the epitome of normalcy, the English countryside.In one of the most stunning prologues ever to grace 1960s cinema, the tiny village of Midwich is going about its business when every person within its limits suddenly passes out. It sets the scene so perfectly because of the sheer eeriness it creates. A once bustling hamlet is shattered by the silence that descends upon it. It just comes out of nowhere.Nobody can enter Midwich without suffering the same effects. As an unfortunate pilot discovers when he flies too close to the town in one of VOTD's most shocking moments. Hours later, everyone recovers none the worse for wear. But things are just getting warmed up.Every woman in town is pregnant, including Anthea Zellaby, the wife of local teacher Prof Gordon Zellaby (George Sanders). Within a short space of time, all women are bizarrely giving birth to children who grow at an alarming rate.These new children are all the same height, they have the same hair colour, and all the same eyes. Very dark pupils, but glow eerily when they concentrate hard enough. They begin to display powers of telepathy, and more disturbingly, mind control. Its left to Gordon to unravel the mystery of these pintsize invaders before they can carry out they're masterplan.Village of the Damned is one of the most effective smalltown paranoia stories I have ever seen. It is so daring in so many ways, and gets its points across without coming out and saying anything at all.A common staple of 1950s alien invasion tales was the very idea of a township of suburban conformity being usurped by some outside force. And while its very easy to throw VOTD in with that crowd, its what the film does with its idea that makes it so fascinating right through to the very end.There's a marvellous sense of ambiguity to this entire scenario. The film is (perhaps deliberately) vague concerning the mysterious origins of these children. Its easy enough to assume they're aliens. But they could just as easily be supernatural in origin. Or maybe the result of some en masse government sponsored experiment. You just never know.The children's unknown motives are a source of endless fascination or frustration depending upon each individual person. I was always asking questions about why they're here. But the film skirts the issue and never really gives us any proper explanation. It can sometimes be a little inconsiderate, but the fact that it doesn't make things cut and dry only adds to the films mystery.Director Wolf Rilla gets a wonderful sense of unease out of this story. Shot in beautifully crisp B&amp;W, it seems to heighten the sense of foreboding, especially whenever the children are around. Rilla does a superb job making them appear alien(?) in origin. I like the little quirks they have. They all walk at the same pace. Always in a group. They all turn they're heads at the same time. They're blankness intensifies they're alienness. In fact Rilla is so good at making them seem unnatural you wonder if they really needed the glowing eyes routine.The B&amp;W photography certainly makes their eyes look spooky and appropriately eerie, but it seems an effect too far. You may like the effect. And then again you might not. But when you've got a wonderful performance from young Martin Stephens, that's really all you need. He plays David, Gordon's son, and leader of the children. With his elocuted articulation and aloof demeanour, he seems alien without ever having to raise his voice. His impeccable diction is unnerving on a child. And that's really quite enough.Rilla also makes sure he keeps up the pace. We know the children are planning something in they're communal mind-link. So Rilla thrusts Gordon to the fore as hero. He's failed to either get through to them, or appeal to whatever humanity they might have (if any). So he comes to a staggering conclusion. Since they kill anyone who poses a threat to them, he must kill them first. Even if it means taking his own life. And that's exactly what he does in the tense finale.His mental confrontation with them is superb. So simple too. A brick wall conceals the fact he's planning to blow them up. The bomb is ticking away all the while they're tearing his mental barriers down a brick at a time. Classic stuff!The ending is refreshingly downbeat, and a little ambiguous too. Surely such powerful creatures could survive a bomb blast. Couldn't they? Village of the Damned is a masterful exercise in audience manipulation. This once peaceful town is slowly eroded from the inside out, all building to a perfectly sustained and very intense climax.A classic in every sense of the word.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Unmissable, Suspense-Filled Sci-Fi Classic Of Alien Space Kids In Rural England</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One day, everyone in the English village of Midwich inexplicably falls asleep for several hours at the same time. Months later it emerges that all women of a suitable age are pregnant, dating from the strange day. What happened, and will their children be human ?I must confess a bias; the book on which this movie is based - The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham - is one of my very favourite novels, a short, sharp, stunning story with a killer premise and a gripping, scary, imaginative and exhilarating narrative. The movie is an almost note-perfect adaptation; the pre-credits depiction of the blackouts is one of the best opening sequences in any film, the mystery and suspense leading to the birth and development of the alien space children is terrific and the finale is (literally) explosive. What I particularly love about this story is the depiction of alien/evil in the children. A standard alien invasion story (say War Of The Worlds) makes the threat very external and other-worldly, but in this tale the conquerors are much more domestic and innocent-seeming. This is such a rich theme; the space-seed idea seems curiously plausible, are the kids at least partly human, and aren't children the Earth's natural inheritors anyway ? Sanders is excellent as the troubled protagonist, Gordon Zellaby, in my favourite of his many roles, and solid supporting performers like Naismith and Vernon give the film great legitimacy and dramatic bite. Geoffrey Faithful's camera-work is brilliant, documenting the village with sharp intensity, flowing into the action and not wasting a single shot. Brilliantly scripted by the prolific Stirling Silliphant (who also wrote In The Heat Of The Night and The Poseidon Adventure amongst others), with solid direction by the otherwise undistinguished Rilla. Despite its low budget, this is the original and fabulous creepy kids movie (predating Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist and The Omen), a model of lean, exciting film-making and one of the best British science-fiction / horror films ever made. Followed by a sort-of sequel (Children Of The Damned in 1963) and remade (brilliantly) by John Carpenter in 1995.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Economical but consummately told sci-fi invasion thriller of the sixties. A poorly paced and largely execrable remake was released in the nineties to not unexpected indifference. For some reason the alien invader must always be un-encumbered by emotions and pity, thus inferior to god's chosen and divine beings i.e, us. There is a touching scene in which Zellaby serenades his wife to the piano which is not as corny as it sounds and pats his dog possibly for the last time as he goes for a lone showdown with the demonic children. Some have felt let down by the ending but I thought it worked a treat. Actor George Sanders eventually committed suicide out of boredom but you will not be afflicted with a similar malaise while watching this picture, although like me you may find the use of children in adult material revolving around homicide extremely distasteful.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What makes this film a creepy delight is the way the dozen blonde kids take over the focus of the story. That scene when young David (Martin Stephens) tells his father (George Sanders) - 'You have to be taught to leave us alone" - well, it just sends a chill up your spine. I liked the way the story interjected all those supernatural elements like the hive mind concept, the 'unknown hair group' and the unusual fingernails. You didn't get to see some of it, but it still worked it's magic on the suspense of the story. Of course the glowing eyes were the kicker, they usually meant something nasty was about to happen. Much in the tradition of Gary Cooper's "High Noon", the film's climax was heralded by the tense countdown of the ticking clock, one's hoping against hope that Gordon Zellaby's (Sanders) sacrifice would put an end to world domination by unseen and unknown forces. With it's minimalist sets and effective manipulation of one's imagination, the film evokes the kind of horror that nightmares are made of.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I never actually seen this movie before. I knew The Simpson's took the mickey outta the children in one episode but never knew about the movie until now! Even though it's meant to be creepy, I liked the fact the story involved children with glowing eyes and hypnotizing the adults. It's more like tricking the adult mind so they can get what they want. Oh boy, wouldn't I like to have those powers as a kid!I found the beginning of the movie was rather odd. I know it'll be lovely to suddenly fall asleep for a few hours in the daytime but, there wasn't any explanation to why the ordinary village people fainted and became cold. I wonder if the aliens were trying to kill the adult humans while they were sleeping? Who knows!I found the ending quite disturbing, I mean the children really didn't hurt the adults nor were murderers. Why the hell did they have to suddenly kill off George Sanders and little Martin Stephens among the rest so suddenly?! I couldn't understand why they had to do this as a remake in 1995, they should've left this classic gem alone! I would avoid that since remakes are the worst thing that could happen to an original movie! I would definitely go for this brilliant film then the 1995 film!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Taut and Tense Little British Horror Movie that Landed in the Aftermath of the Fifties Sci-Fi Boom and had an Impact that Resonates to this Day. Those who saw it in the Theatres in 1960 be it Child or Adult, Simply could not Forget it. Director John Carpenter Obviously could not and Decided to Remake it in 1995 but Failed to Capture its Compelling and Captivating Cultural Significance.This Movie has that Invasion of Those Without Souls Effect that is at Once Creepy and Foreboding. Here that Impending Doom Atmosphere is Amped to make the Invaders Children who are Otherworldly and Ominous even though they were "Born" of Human Mothers and a "Supernatural/Alien" Father.The Film Delivers on all Fronts as it Unfolds with Urgency and Frustration as the Situation is Impending, but also Plays on Our Most Basic Urges of Parenting and Nurturing. The Children are so Evolved Collectively that it Becomes Clear that Unrestrained (Communism) the World will Fall like Dominoes at the Behest of these Would Be Conquerors. A Winner from the Beginning, with its Eerie English Countryside Slumber Infested Village, to its Brutal Deaths at the Hands (Eyes) of the Child-Hive, to the Downbeat and Explosive Ending this is a Mini-Masterpiece of its Time and is a Film not Easily Dismissed, Even when Viewed Anew in this Era of Budget Excesses and Playful Cinematic Shenanigans. This is Minimalist Cinema at its Best.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>John Wyndham's Midwich Horror</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>For several hours during an otherwise innocuous day, everyone in the English town of "Midwich" faints into a deathlike coma. Save damage to a record player's needle, an iron-burned shirt, wayward automobiles and the like, it appears as no permanent damage is caused by the incident. Then, several weeks later, each female resident of child-bearing age learns she is expecting...For older George Sanders (as Gordon Zellaby) and beautiful young Barbara Shelley (as Anthea), this is welcome news; they were hoping Mr. Sanders' "late life" start wouldn't preclude pregnancy. But, other villagers aren't so happy; a man returning from an extended trip accuses his wife of adultery, and immaculate conceptions abound. Wait until you see the children? ******** Village of the Damned (12/7/60) Wolf Rilla ~ George Sanders, Martin Stephens, Barbara Shelley, Michael Gwynne</fullReview>

		<fullReview>As I have already reviewed the 1995 remake, I thought I'd better do a review of this brilliant story, this is set in a nice little village all is well, until one day, we experience a blackout for 4 hours or is it 6? well events start to turn strange, as all the females find out to their horror that they are to have babies, and what strange nippers they are!! if you anger them, then you become a cropper to these glaring eyes. and why do they all look alike ? and can they be nice children? I think not! this time, David is the leader of these evil race of children. I quite liked George Saunders as The professor and he seemed a nice man in the film. at the end he had to think of a brick wall, as the children put it, "your'e thinking of ,(Pause) a brick wall, it 's 8:32p.m. " the pause was scary! I also found that you could not hide your thoughts from the children, they knew too much. you could not outwit them. I am going to transfer this onto a disc soon</fullReview>

		<fullReview>~Spoiler~ Village of the Damned is based on The Midwich Cuckoos by John Wyndham (who also penned Day of the Triffids) and it has a brilliant premise. A small town is encompassed by an unseen force that causes everyone in a certain radius to fall asleep. Later, when they awake, they find all of the women of the village pregnant. Very scary stuff. It's actually one of the best science-fiction plots ever. The children that are born from this event are eerie and detached. They seem devoid of human emotions and hint that they are from a superior race. The word "aliens" might be on everyone's brain while watching this movie but the film never comes right out and says it and I think that's a great touch. The actors are all quite good but the main child actor, Martin Stephens, is amazing. He has more range than most adult actors. It's a shame he didn't work much after this. I recommend John Carpenter's remake as well but I seem to be in the minority on that issue. This film is missing one ingredient that Carpenter added: the late, great Buck Flower.</fullReview>

Plenty of us have seen MST3K before i'm sure, and being my favorite show, i thought i'd go out and rent some old b.w. horror movies to spoof with help from friends in the comfort of my own home. I had the "pleasure" of seeing the 1960 horror "classic" Village of the Damned. I'll tell you this, if u are the kind of person who likes to get a nice snack during the movie, RENT VILLAGE OF THE DAMNED!!! This movie really takes about 20 minutes to get to the real plot. Here it is... ready? A group of young boys and girls with cooky eyes read thoughts and kill people... that's it! I admit, it was a shock to see such a movie from the '60s. It was ahead of it's time for sure. I'd like to see a remake of this movie, but i think i'd change a few things about it. #1) THE PLOT!!! I only learned one thing from this movie: If you see a bunch of strange looking kids all dressed in the same clothes walking like zombies... Don't Mess With Them! I'd hate to ruin the ending... actually, i would, but there really isn't anything left to ruin. Well, this has been my first in a series of many "NO BULL" reviews from me, MARC. I hope i have helped you in your search for good movies. Do yourself a favor and DON'T RENT the 1960 horror "classic" Village of the Damned. After seeing this movie, you'll truly wanna drive your car into a brick wall too. YEESH!!! Anyway, that's it from me. Until next time. LATA!!!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I am here watching the original "Village of the Damned." This was one of my favorite movies as a child. I use to have a crush on one of the evil kids and would have to watch it every time it was on television just to catch glimpses of him. If you haven't seen it, try and watch it. You won't be disappointed. I will have to say that the remake with Christopher Reeve did a pretty damn good job in sticking to the storyline. There is not much deviation, except a few details here and there. The plot is a little scary because what would you do if you were pregnant with an alien life form? Would you have love for that child even if you knew he/she was evil? I love how movies in the past use to explore these type of questions. It's something that is lacking in the movies of today. This movie had everything: good acting, amazing plot, deep questions, and the music was phenomenal. Foreign films still have some of those qualities, so I am glad that they haven't been completely lost. It is too bad that the sequel "Children of the Damned" was pale in comparison. Evil children, aliens, and death. What more could you ask for?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Village of the Damned is set in the small English village of Midwich where professor Gordon Zelaby (George Sanders) is on the phone to his Brother-in-law Major Alan Bernard (Michael Gwynn) when he suddenly collapses, on the other end of the phone Alan becomes worried &amp; sets off for Midwich when he can't raise anyone there. As he approaches the village he meets the local police man (Peter Vaughan) who also says he can't contact anyone in the village, as the copper rides off ahead of Alan he suddenly collapses as if he suddenly fainted. Upon witnessing this Alan calls in his army mates to seal off the area, they send people in but they too just collapse for no apparent reason. Then just as suddenly as they collapsed everyone in Midwich wakes up without any recollection of what happened, no one has any clue what went on but everyone seemed fine. Then, a few months later Dr. Willers (Laurence Naismith) reports that every woman in Midwich capable of child birth is pregnant. If that wasn't strange enough when the children are born they don't seem human...This British American co-production was co-written &amp; directed by Wolf Rilla &amp; is a fairly effective little chiller from the 60's although I'm not as keen on it as some of the glowing comments on the IMDb would suggest other's are. The script by Rilla, Stirling Sillipahnt &amp; Ronald Kinnoch was based on the novel 'The Midwich Cuckoos' by John Wyndham (which I have not read so I cannot compare the film to it) &amp; starts off brilliantly, the opening sequence where the entire village of Midwich suddenly collapses is fantastic &amp; hooked me straight away, I was eagerly awaiting an explanation which never came unfortunately. I was hoping the film would give me some cool &amp; clever reasoning behind the events in Midwich &amp; the subsequent birth of some strange children but beyond some vague theories by Government officials it never did &amp; that's my biggest problem with Village of the Damned, when it had finished I felt sort of cheated, I felt like the filmmakers had this fantastic concept &amp; idea but didn't know how to explain it. At just over 70 minutes the film moves along at nice pace &amp; is never boring, the character's are OK &amp; the film also tries to raise various moral issues surrounding the children &amp; what the authorities plan to do with them. It's a good film, a very watchable &amp; entertaining film but I felt there were far too many unanswered questions, which to be fair some people may like but personally I didn't.Director Rilla does a good job, there's a nice close knit English community feel to it &amp; the film has a pretty eerie atmosphere to it. Now, the children themselves, personally I thought they looked pretty comical with they're obviously bad fitting blonde wigs. They might have been scary 40 odd years ago but times &amp; the world has moved on, these days in Britian we have 16 year olds stealing cars, going for a joyride &amp; ending up killing a baby only to get a couple of years in jail because of the way British law is at the moment, now the fact we have real life scum like that walking our streets is scarier than anything in Village of the Damned. Maybe that was a bad analogy but my point remains valid, in today's society a few children with badly fitting wigs &amp; dubbed British upper class accents are just not scary at all.With a supposed budget of about $200,000 Village of the Damned is a well made film with nice production values. The acting was alright.Village of the Damned is a good film of that I agree but there were just too many gaps in the plot for me to be totally satisfied with it as the end credits rolled. A good sci-fi/horror film but in my opinion not as good as many like to make out. Children of the Damned (1963) was a loose sequel while John Carpenter directed a remake Village of the Damned (1995).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>**SPOILERS** After some mysterious force put all the residents of Midwich England into a state of suspended animation for some three hours it soon became apparent that some dozen women of child bearing age suddenly became pregnant! Some of these women or young girls, who were virgins at the time, didn't even have sexual relations with their husbands or boyfriends at any time before their pregnancies. One shocked married woman became pregnant to the distress of her husband, who felt that she had an affair with another man, while he was away at sea, as a stevedore, for more then a year!It soon became apparent that the women who became pregnant had fetus that were growing at an amazing rate. Being born some four months premature, but in fact fully developed, the babies were delivered by the towns doctor Dr.Willers, Laurence Naismith, within ten hours of each other. It also became apparent to everyone in town, including the new born children's parents, that these strange human-like hybrids were in fact not human at all but somehow inseminated into the young women of Midwich's wombs by aliens from outer space!Gordon Zellaby, George Sanders, is the first person in town to realize that the strange children, one that was his own, are a danger not only to the town of Widwich but the entire planet! Gordon soon comes to the conclusion that the strange "Space Children" are a plan by aliens from outer space to take over the earth from within. This unbelievable plan is confirmed by Gordon in news reaching him that the strange happenings, mysterious super babies being born, in Midwich are in fact happening all over the globe; In the USSR Australia the Arctic and Inner Mongolia among other places on earth.It's when the children came out into the open that things really got out of hand in their trying to take over the town and use it as a breeding ground for future generations of "Space Children". lead by Gordon and his wife's Anthea's, Barbara Shelley, spaced-out son David, Martin Stephens, the children now know, with their mind reading abilities, that the jig was up in that the townspeople were getting wise to them. David and his fellow "Space Children" have, of all people, his non biological father Gordon recruited to secretly get them out of town before hey end up getting burned at the stake by the outraged townspeople whom they themselves are planning to wipe out.Gordon knowing that only he can in fact not only save Midwich but the entire planet has to play it safe, and brainless, to keep the children including his son David from finding out what he's really up to by keeping his mind a total blank. Building an imaginary brick wall between his mind and that of the super intelligent "Space Children" Gordon keeps his plan that he has in store for them out of the reach of their mind reading powers! That's until it's too late for them to find it out.Based on the novel "The Midwich Cuckoo" the movie "Village of the Damned" has to do with how a cuckoo bird, who isn't that cuckoo at all, lays its eggs in other species of birds nests. It has the birds fooled into thinking that the eggs are that of their own offspring and thus raise and nurture them without knowing that their in fact someone else's: Those of the very clever and sneaky cuckoo bird. The same thing happened in Midwich where an invisible alien force tricked the local townspeople into thinking that the children that they impregnated them with where human but in fact they were not. Or at least not those of the men, like Gordon Zellaby, who were made to believe that they fathered them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Something unusual is happening in the quaint British village of Midwich. Following a mysterious, concentrated incident that left every resident of the village passed out for several hours, every able-bodied woman has unexpectedly found herself pregnant, regardless of her recent sexual behaviour. When the offspring eventually come ? and quicker than usual ? it doesn't take long for local scientist Gordon Zellaby (the ever-charming George Sanders) to notice something seriously wrong with this curious new batch of youngsters. Blonde-haired, and with eerily-glowing eyes, these children swiftly develop an aptitude for advanced psychological reasoning, an ability than soon extends into the supernatural realm of mind control. Are these children really human? If not, where have they come from? What are their plans? How can they be stopped? A film like 'Village of the Damned (1960)' could probably have never been made in the United States at this time, considering the story's sensitive and sinister themes of immaculate conception and child murder, but the Brits know exactly how to make horror work.The film was adapted from John Wyndham's 1957 novel, "The Midwich Cuckoos," a book title that gives me an eerie chill every time I read it. The cuckoo, as most readers would already know, is a variety of bird that effectively "parasitises" other species with its offspring, laying their eggs in the nests of other birds and so allowing their chicks to be raised by an oblivious "foster parent." The cuckoo hatchling, in many cases, instinctively kills off its adopted siblings, while the host mother continues to raise the impostor as her own. This scenario begs the terrifying question: just whose children are being raised by the residents of Midwich? 'Village of the Damned' casts doubt on the traditional wisdom that children are mere innocents, and the inversion/corruption of youth purity by evil forces would play a role in countless subsequent horror pictures, including Clayton's 'The Innocents (1961),' Polanksi's 'Rosemary's Baby (1968),' Friedkin's 'The Exorcist (1973)' and Donner's 'The Omen (1976).'I enjoyed the professionalism with which director Wolf Rilla allowed the tale to unfold. Sufficient time is dedicated to the incidents preceding the Children's' conception, as an entire village sits breathlessly quiet and frantic military forces attempt to understand the baffling occurrence. George Sanders retains the intelligent, charismatic charms of his youth, such that his pairing with Barbara Shelley ? 27 years his junior ? doesn't seem a stretch of the imagination, at least not in a story like this. Gordon Zellaby's scientific neutrality, and his unwillingness to oversimplify matters into notions of "good" and "evil," allow him to connect, however tentatively, with the minds of the Children, whose interactions amongst themselves are truly disquieting. They never communicate verbally, and seem to function as one, like a super-organic colony of termites. Martin Stephens, the young actor who delivered one of the all-time great child performances in Jack Clayton's 'The Innocents (1961),' here plays the Children's' leader, David, his every syllable laced with a sinister coldness, detached from every discernible hint of emotion.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A promising start let down by a lacklustre and disappointing end. For an early sixties British movie the build up of tension in this film was excellent However after an hour the production company must have run out of money, as it just ends, with no explanations, tension, or real climax. Never mind, it's still worth seeing for the first half hour, and those weird, scary, scary eyes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I finally watched this movie, always heard it was a classic, but I was not overly impressed with this film. Not that I thought it was bad or anything, just not all that I had heard it was. The plot starts out very interesting with an entire town passing out, but the cause is unknown as it is not a gas as there is a well defined line where if you cross it you pass out. The effects end as mysteriously and quickly as they started and everything seems to return to normal with one possible problem, every female in town of child birthing age is now pregnant with child. This of course causes some problems with women whose husbands have been gone and others who swear they have not had any sex. Then the children are born and they are creepy and they have creepy eyes, but they are also very well behaved just so long as you do not cross them. If you do they will shine those creepy eyes and make you do horrible things. Then the movie is over way to quickly and there just is not enough there for my tastes. I am all for a horror movie not overstaying its welcome, but this is just silly as this film needed more. It also suffers from the fact these children can be taken out, they know this, yet instead of playing it cool they lash out and kill people bringing about the wrath of the town. Still, it started out great, just needed more near the end when the children were on the rampage, maybe making them a bit tougher or something. The end just seemed to abrupt and anti-climatic.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One morning, in a small Britaish Village, all the locals including the animals fall unconscious for no apparent reason. Later, all the males &amp; animals wake up, unaffected by the happening while every female in the Village capable of child birth awake only to find out that they are pregnant.Three years later, the children of those women have all grown up at an impossible speed, physically &amp; mentally. They all walk in a group, dress in black &amp; have pasty-blonde hair complete with those pairs of eerie, glowing eyes. Some of the locals think they are evil &amp;...those who do are right. Anyone who is a threat to them is killed &amp; since they can read minds, anyone able to stop them is in danger.Village of the Damned (1960) has been received as some sort of cult-classic which it is. But I felt that it's overrated. All these reviews talking about how scary it is (some even said that they had nightmares because the glowing eyes of the children scared them so much) are near ridiculous. I hope that the people who had nightmares from this film were only joking as Village of the Damned was spooky in the least.There were a few creepy scenes to find containing the children but that was it. The 'scary' parts were predictable, there were some boring scenes thrown in &amp; the last part of the movie-the resolution of how to get rid of the children felt rushed. Anyway I feel that Village of the Damned has only became a cult classic probably because the children or the creepiness of their stare.Maybe Village of the Damned is only predictable because I've seen too many films with the evil child(ren) aspect but there isn't much to like about this movie. I found myself trying to come up with all the positive notes this movie had in it but there weren't many. Well, the acting was convincing, it appears well-made despite its low budget &amp; the kids were creepy.So I didn't find much good out of this but maybe you will. It's entertaining, well made, the acting is superb &amp; the movie has some creepy scenes in it. Even though it seems as though I was bashing the film in the paragraphs above, there wasn't much to dislike about Children of the Damned so I'm giving it 3 out of five stars.Followed by the thematic sequel Children of the Damned (1963) &amp; John Carpenter's Village of the Damned (1995, the remake).</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Village of the damned is a sci-fi horror, where a small town strangely falls asleep for several hours, and the women become pregnant as a result. And the result of this result results in a bunch of children who all dress the same, have strange hair, glowing eyes and superior intelligence. The film raises a number of questions - how did this happen? Are these children aliens, evolved humans or mutants? Are they a threat to society? What is their purpose? If they are a threat, can killing them be justified? While the film contains these interesting ideas, I felt that some of the themes raised could have been addressed in a bit more detail, which would have made the film more interesting, but it is never the less an original and intriguing feature.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I hate to say it, but this one's overrated. I'm a huge fan of old sci-fi flicks, and this one has a lot of good elements, but they never quite gel into a good film.As others have already noted, the story starts off with a lot of promise when the entire village of Midwich apparently drops dead. We spend a good 15 minutes learning they're only unconscious, and then they awake - no explanation is given. Creepy, but sort of a waste of time. The book apparently handles this sequence much better - in the book there's a metallic object in the center of the village, which goes away just before everyone wakes up. This sequence is also used to introduce a military character, but he turns out to be totally superfluous again wasting the viewer's time.The story doesn't really get going until the villagers learn so many of their women are suddenly pregnant. Given the stigma of illegitimacy in that era this segment offers the film's most interesting (and adult) character drama. The girls are obviously distressed and the men outraged, but we don't see quite as much of the villagers' reaction to these events as the first 20 minutes of the film lead us to believe we might, with the gossiping telephone operators and shop owners it took pains to introduce.Instead the film unfortunately narrows its focus down to the lead scientist figure, his wife and the creepy kids, in particular their "son" David. And it's here that the film sort of falls apart. While the white wig suits David alright, on some of the other kids they look laughably fake. Prancing around the village in their black coats they make for quite a camp sight ? if a group of drag queens haven't dressed up like that for Halloween yet, they will someday.As the film lurches somewhat robotically toward its conclusion the remaining characters simply become vehicles to further the plot. There are a few genuinely creepy moments left ? such as when we learn that the Russians nuked their village of white-haired brats ? but they aren't enough to make up for the clumsily-directed "suspense" sequence which concludes the film.Village of the Damned, in becoming a somewhat tedious monster movie, feels like it's missing a real opportunity to make some interesting social or political statements. The first half of the movie hints at becoming a character-centric, socially and politically-aware drama, something which would have made this film truly stand above its contemporaries. Instead we get a film that feels less sophisticated than contemporary American sci-fi fare, like Forbidden Planet or Invasion of the Body Snatchers. It isn't an awful film by any means ? indeed it's quite an accomplishment, given the budget ? but it could have been so much more.I certainly don't think it deserves its reputation as some kind of a classic. If you want a better horror film from 1960, Hitchcock's Psycho is the one to beat. George Pal's 1960 version of The Time Machine is the better science fiction film, though it's almost as flawed as Village. Other, better genre films from this era include The Haunting, The Birds, and (if it's camp you want) What Ever Happened to Baby Jane. I'd recommend seeing all of those before screening Village. They're classics. This film? Not so much.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brilliant story but pretty weird execution of it.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The story of the movie is highly original and quite brilliant however the execution of the story by German director Wolf Rilla (who apparently now runs his own restaurant in Southern France) is not something I'm happy about.The movie's pace doesn't always flow really well and is incoherent. We jump from one scene to another without any obvious connection.Still the movie is a strong piece of British science-fiction/horror. The story itself is what makes this movie a classic. The movie is not really a scary one but more one with a mysterious atmosphere. You never know what is going to happen next or how it is going to end all. The beginning and the end are the strongest parts of the movie, especially the mysterious beginning is one to remember.The good British acting is top-class. Especially the young Martin Stephens does an amazing job as 'leader' of the children. He was pretty scary and unreal at times.Not really recommendable for the casual viewer, this movie is too old fashioned for them, however if you're a fan of the genre this is a must see.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/</fullReview>

I did get a little bored in the middle of the movie but then I really enjoyed last 20 mixtures of movie and number of things gong at the same time but I wish there more to the aftermath of movie. just to end it after that.

		<fullReview>It is a curio this one, the "The Midwich Cuckoos" (1957) as the novel is named and penned by John Wyndham (1903 - 1969) is a science fiction story, and too, a film that unsettles the quaint rustic life of rural England. Things are not what they seem here, with the going-ons with the village women and the blond-haired children born asunder, there is something here to delve into, but at the same time, there is nothing to show for it. We are intrigued by the unexplainable shenanigans of how the men folks' women all conceive and give birth at the very same time to identical, charismatic children months after the villagers' suddenly fell where they were into deep sleep. A perimeter that if caught inside its radius and being of the fertile female gender, an awkward if not embarrassing predicament of explanation would be forthcoming.It is all very suspenseful, as to say it follows act after act that goes deeper and deeper into the progression of the lives of the unfortunate ladies and their more than perplexed husbands. Also, what is to come is more than inquisitive as to why these newly born children are almost identical to each other in respects to intelligence, appearance and being. As the story advances so does the discouraging rate of attitudes of bewilderment and resentment within the village, we are giving an insight to the reactions and results that are often disturbing both by adult as too by mysterious child. Then to find that these strange children are not singled out but in fact are the result of a strange occurrence of sleeping villages and super intelligent children conceived and born from other parts of the world in the same manner that only deepens the narrative.Anxiety and concerns are what rolls the plot alone, with George Sanders (1906 - 1972) as the lead role and surrogate, scientist father to what can be deemed as the alpha-male child; it is a battle of science over military control and which line is crossed to keep these children sedated or to be used as a valuable learning tool. Mind over muscle wins the debate, literally and perpetually. This is all very charming and lends itself open to many interesting debates on just how were these women impregnated, how in fact does the children's growth rate, physically and intellectually, progress so quickly, and are these blond-haired children in the fullest sense alien? Or, more to the point is the human race now devolving to such an extent that our own minds, intellect and bodies have finally become redundant? By standing next to this, possibly, next advancement in human development we now seem so primitive to these super-beings who may have evolved to the next level of humanity. The mind here is dominant, there seems no physical response or need, either for lovemaking to conceive or to fight-off foes, it is the mind that has taken the next level. The ever-baited audience are, ironically, left to make up their own minds as to these mind-probing questions and the narrative leaves no room for answers, not insofar as it cannot but it simply does not. The tension and anticipation is ever present and more than ominous with the strange behaviour of the children and the spite they endeavour, with the feeling of a hidden threat lurking, waiting and with disastrous consequence.There is nothing of face value to fill the void of questions while the lack of answers also heightens the level of danger of the unknown, we are, too, placed in the position of these poor villagers who must concede to their fears, cower in silence and question what not yet has been answered. Such is this paradox of its failings and triumphs of this great little film. It is a strange tale this one, and it does make one a little curious as to whom, why and for what are the gains are these children and the ever so demanding needs on their very survival. There is something lurking here, lurking in the unknowing, lurking under the skin and sinisterly lurking behind the eyes of these blond-haired children. With this, it has only exposed itself as a quaint film of mild interest and meagre involvement but also void of real content; visually, emotionally or dimensionally, while not in the shallow or tedium perspectives. In this direction it seems to be imploding in any substantial gain that toward its end it promises to deliver more than it can offer.</fullReview>
