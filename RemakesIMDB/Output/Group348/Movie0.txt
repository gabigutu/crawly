		<shortDescription>Truly excellent!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while, a true gem pops up unexpectedly. This story based on a legend from the Lapps, or Saami, is just such a case in point. Everything in it works. The elements of folklore and the mythic journey come together in an amazing tale of a young man's journey to manhood and redemption. The most amazing thing about this film, however, is its realization in the cultural context from which it belongs. This is a Saami legend, told in the Saami language and Saami actors giving us a deep drink of their rich culture. The scenery is breathtaking in its stark, snow-white beauty. The tale is brutal but life in the circumpolar region we knew as Lappland was often brutal and unforgiving. This is a hearty tale of a hardy people and while it focuses on the journey and heroic adventure of a young man, it is also very much a tale of the Saami people, many of whom still follow their reindeer herds across that barren, frozen landscape today. The film is wonderful in its simplicity and honesty. There are no high dramatic moments, no cars flying across the screen, no explosions with smoke and fire billowing into the air and no open-mouth noisy smooching. As one reviewer noted, Disney, Lucas and Spielberg could well take lessons from this film. It is simply excellent and merely greatly wonderful. My only regret as an anthropologist who specialized in working with pastoral nomads, was that I never worked with the Saami or the Tibetans [viewers who liked this film should also check out Himalaya, for a similar way of life on the other side of the world from the Saami]</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pure brilliance this is!Living very close to the land and culture that's described in the film I really enjoyed this film. The way everything's been explained and displayed in the film is very satisfying. And I might add that it's not required to have an interest in the culture to watch this movie. That is to say that the movie works on every level! Gaup delivers a very strong and entertaining movie. I only wish it can have a broader audience, because it deserves it. I have no problem recommending this film to anyone with a slight interest in movies!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is the best film ever to come out of Norway. Mythical realism on its best. I've seen it several times and it only gets better. The unpolished brutality and savage behavior in this film can only be matched by Fargo (96). Beautifully set on Finnmarksvidda, the northern most part of Norway -Way north of the arctic circle, it shows the way of the life a thousand years ago. The silent winter morning is of course interrupted. Savages from an eastern land comes to plunder and rape the same people. Less than ten minutes into the film the heros family has been brutally slayed and are being deposed of as he returns home from hunting. The Washington Post calls it Die Hard on snow, without a barefoot Bruce Willis as the american stereotyped hero, instead it's realistic - I agree.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Amazing isn't it? It takes a 1000 year-old Lapp legend to put Lucas and "Steven" Schpeilberg in their place. It doesn't cost multi millions of dollar$ to make a brilliant action film. It takes an intelligble script,sensitive acting and spot on directing (oh, and lots of snow). What's happened to the people who made this (including the producers)? Someday studios will realise that a good script and story will go a long way above a load of bangs and unrealistic computer graphics. Ah well! What the hey!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warning: Spoiler! Detailed Summary</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>An excellent film based on a thousand year old legend,"Pathfinder" was nominated for an Oscar for best foreign film. Directed by Miles Gaup, his first film, Pathfinder is from a tale he heard from his grandfather. The film is in the Lapp language and reflects the customs and costumes of ancient northern Norway in the deep of winter.The legend is of a Lapp boy, Aigin, played by Mikkel Gaup. Aigin's family is murdered by a barbarian group, the Tchudes, who are invading and killing along the way. Aigin is wounded but escapes and finds his way across waist deep snow to collapse once he reaches the nearest village. The villagers are terrified of the Tchudes, and mad at Aigin for leaving a blood trail for the murderous band to follow. Rasti-the Noidi (a sort of shaman), played by Nils Utsi, tells a frightened Aigin about visions of the great reindeer. Rasti also tells the boy about how the brotherhood of mankind is connected to everything: to be out of touch was to be a Tchude.Most of the townspeople flee to the safety of the village on the seashore, having strength in numbers, and in the fact that it (the village) lies at the base of an extremely treacherous mountain.A few of the original villagers stay with Aigin to fight the Tchudes: even reducing the barbarians' numbers before being captured. Rasti-the-Noidi is killed and Aigin is used as a pathfinder to locate the people who live by the sea. Aigin tricks the Tchudes on the side of the mountain and they are killed in an avalanche.The sea-villagers see the snow engulfing the Tchudes. They go back inside their thick animal-hide tents and build their fires high, composing a story of the great boy Aigin who saves his people. Aigin shows up at their door, bloodied once again. This time, the villagers are not mad - they hand him Rasti's little skin drum. He is now Aigin-the-Noidi.The use of subtitles is something which American viewers have a hard time accepting. American audiences have a sort of arrogance about a film that is not spoken in English. The subtitles in Pathfinder; however, are not a hindrance. Action and vocal inflection carry the storyline well enough that a viewer could probably understand what's going on without the subtitles even being there.Besides the universal good versus evil theme, the viewers are treated to a view of a boy growing up: the way Aigin looks at the girl from the village when he's hurt versus the way he looks at her once he is the Noidi. Keeping in touch with human kind and with nature are also themes stated in this movie.Director Nils Gaup gives the audience a bit of foreshadowing with a flying crow: to symbolize impending death. The way he films the journey shots in letterbox style is nice because the viewer can always tell when the Tchudes are traveling. The sound is interesting in that every time the Tchudes come into a scene, there is a sound like a cross between a car door slamming and a slab of foot-thick ice cracking underfoot; which is a little disconcerting, just like the Tchudes themselves.Pathfinder has a great deal of violence in it. The body count is high enough to compare it to a Rambo, or Dirty Harry movie in the sheer amount of killing. However, in Pathfinder, the camera does not relish the gore, only uses it to convey the atrocities carried out on those peaceful Lapplanders.Overall, Pathfinder is a wonderful movie that really has not received the attention that it rightfully deserves. It has good style, interesting culture, and a storyline that has been worked for a thousand years.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of the many beauties of this film is the exquisite simplicity. Filming, acting, directing, costuming - all have been distilled to their essence so that the viewer is never distracted from the superb story. I watch this film several times a year (and have given it as gifts to friends) and no longer bother to read the sub-titles, so clear has the story become to me. We lost a great deal when we stopped sitting around fires telling stories to one another; this film can give some of that back to us.</fullReview>

I posted on IMDb and another viewer knew the movie based on my description. It takes place in prehistoric time, but the characters are very human: you feel as if they are family. While there are subtitles, there is not much dialog: you can follow the movie very well without even looking at them. The photography is stunning. Not only is the scenery gorgeous, but the camera angles and the scene composition is wonderful. This is a movie which will bless you with its memory for the rest of your life.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hidden gem</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A magical movie in that it connects the viewer to two world at once--the here-and-now world and the mystical world which connects all people to creation. This is hinted at in the double meaning of "pathfinder", as Rasti points out to "the lad" when he explains the difference between them and the bandits. The bandits, Rasti says, have lost their way, in a spiritual as well as literal way. So the Pathfinder is guide for both this and the spirit world. In leading the bandits to their death, the lad becomes their Pathfinder in the spiritual sense as well--leading them further along the path of spiritual self-destruction that they have set out on. Having followed this path to the end, he is able to return to his people and become their new Pathfinder. The spiritual symbolism of the story also resonates with Christian symbolism--the hero who offers his life so others may live, who is cast down into the abyss only to rise out of it to bring the good news of salvation and life to his people. But it's also a wonderful tale that takes the viewer to a different time, place, and culture. A tale made even more remarkable by how familiar it seems in its otherness. It's also a wonderful piece of movie-making. Cinemagraphically it must look magnificent on the big screen--the sense of isolation would only be magnified. In a way it's almost a silent movie--the dialogue is eloquently sparse and one could probably follow the story without subtitles. A very rewarding and satisfying movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of the truly great Norwegian movies, and those are sort of far between. The thing is, there's not a single word of Norwegian spoken either. It's all in an ancient dialect of the Sami language. This movie is made by Sami filmmakers based on their history. All in all that's some feat in a country where their people were systematically oppressed by the government. The attempts to wipe out their culture and assimilate them into the Norwegian one is only outevilized by the American hunt for the Indians.The scenery and the light in this movie is truly awesome. It's the kind of light you only get in the dark period in the arctic. The sort of neverending dusk/dawn time. For most of the year, the sun doesn't rise in this part of the world, and this results in the spooky, troll-like feeling of this film.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A frigid, rousing adventure, as well as being a touching film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is the story of a 16-year-old boy 1,000 years ago who finds himself fighting alone against the killers of his mother, father and little sister. It's part epic legend on a small scale and part coming-of-age. Whatever you choose to call it, Pathfinder is an exciting and moving tale. The story is set in the northern-most reaches of what is now Scandinavia amongst the nomadic family groups of the Sami, who hunt and herd reindeer. The landscape is beautiful, but harsh and frigid. Aigin returns one day from a hunting trip to see the corpses of his parents and little sister being dumped in a frozen lake through a hole in the ice. They have been killed by the Tchudes, outlaws who prey on the Sami. Aigin is spotted but manages to escape with an arrow in his shoulder to a small family group several miles away. They treat his wound but immediately prepare to flee to the coast. They know the Tchudes are most likely tracking Aigin. The boy refuses to leave. He plans to stay and fight. "What would you do?" Aigin is asked. "Find them. Before they find us." "Find them," one man says. "We're not warriors!" "If they find us," Aigin says, "you know what will happen. We will have to fight. No one will be spared. Not even the children." And he's right. The Tchudes are outcasts, hard, experienced men who take what they want and slaughter everyone they catch. Three of the men decide to stay with him. There is a fight in the snow, with arrows against crossbows and axes. Aigin is captured. He may be brave, but he also is frightened. To save one of the men who has been his friend, he says he will be a pathfinder. He will show them through the icy passes in the mountains to the large encampment on the coast. His friend, of course, is slaughtered as soon as Aigin is out of sight. From here we switch back and forth between the encampment, largely made up of women and children as the men have left for hunting, and the journey through the frigid, snow- swept passes. This 16-year-old boy is up against two dozen killers, led by an utterly ruthless and shrewd leader. Aigin is no match for any of them if it comes to a fight. All Aigin has is his wits and, as we come to realize, a determination to protect the encampment by destroying the Tchudes even if it means sacrificing his own life. This is played out against the feelings of some in the settlement that Aigin is bad luck, that he led the Tchudes to them earlier and may very well be leading them to the coast where they are now. The conclusion is brutal, redeeming and satisfying. Pathfinder works so well, I think, because the story, which is a simple one, is treated in a straightforward, matter-of-fact manner. The emotions and motivations are simple and strong. The acting is plain and effective. Mikkel Gaup, the 19-year-old son of the film's director and writer, Nils Gaup, is a good-looking kid with blue eyes who comes across as exactly who he is playing, a capable young man who is brave and scared and determined. The feelings that start to show between Aigin and the young woman who treated his arrow wound are tentative and very low-key, and they're all the more touching because of that. This is a strong, affecting story with a little myth and legend-making woven in.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautifully Tragic and Poetic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I literally had to fight to track down and watch this movie but it worth all the trouble for it. "Ofelas" ("Pathfinder") is one of those pictures that doesn't have the attention it deserves, neither a wider distribution that should have and it will stay in this underrated category for a long time. Even with an American remake made in 2007 (I don't think I'll ever watch for countless reasons, to be exposed later on this review) I don't know if people still talk about this precious gem. But all in all, thank you AMPAS for giving a nomination for this as Best Foreign Film, otherwise it'll probably been overlooked under my radar."Ofelas" works almost like "True Grit" in the sense of the audience seeing a teenager who wants to avenge the murder of his family. But instead of the Old West scenario and someone paying for an old Sheriff to do the job, we have the Scandinavian wilderness of many centuries ago, and this time a boy named Aigin (Mikkel Gaup) joins another tribe to help with his plan but they're not so willing since they're not trained warriors like the Tchudes (the brutal tribe that killed the boy's family) and they're in an astonishing disadvantage with plenty of women and children with them. So, the boy decides to go on his own, improvising an intriguing scheme against those murderers, things to make us gripped through the whole time.It's not about just butchery and vengeance, there's plenty of deep mind-blowing things that rare similar projects can deal with. Transcendental like very few pictures can be, I mean really, you can watch this without the captions on and you'll still have a clue of what the movie is about, "Ofelas" surprised me for its poetic presentation of themes like faith, companion, the power of love and also the power of hate and destruction, translated all that through expressions, actions, very few words and when they're used they're magnificent. The dialog in the tent between Aigin and the tribe "pathfinder" Raste (Nils Utsi) is the high point of the film, when the old man teaches the young man what faith is about. "You still can't see it? But now you can feel that something is there. You can't see it in the air, but your very existence is tied to it. In this way all things are bound together, intertwined. No man can ever tear himself apart from the whole." He goes on. "But it can happen that he loses sight of the whole. When he does, he is like the Tchudes. Men who lost the path. They stumble blindly towards self-destruction." This quote also says everything about the villains of whom we're never able to see them talking. They simply show up on the screen and kill everybody. Why? It's all they have. The actor who plays their leader doesn't say a word, not just because the script says so but also because he's the only member of the cast who isn't from Norway. Yet, even if he had lines he would be the perfect choice for the role thanks to his powerful expressions, frightening and controlling, menacing from the first minute his presence is noted.It's a small film but of a great effect. Perfect in every sense, from the acting, the beautiful cinematography, the scary yet majestuous scenaries of mountains and trees. The action sequences has to be one of the greatest ever filmed, including the fight with a bear; the tragic opening scenes with Aigin running away from the Tchudes; the spectacularly thrilling final moments, very nerve-wracking. With all that in mind, why would anyone bother to see the millionaire budget remake? I don't think all the money in the world could represent everything this movie had: heart, soul and a great meaningful story to present. Do whatever you can to watch it. 10/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a story about the Sámi people, to enlighten my reader, here's the beginning of a wikipedia article about them: "The Sami people, also spelled Sámi or Saami, are the indigenous Finno-Ugric people inhabiting the Arctic area of Sápmi, which today encompasses parts of far northern Norway, Sweden, Finland, the Kola Peninsula of Russia, and the border area between south and middle Sweden and Norway."The English title, Pathfinder, is rendered as Ofela? in the Sámi language, and the film is also known as Veiviseren in Norwegian. Around the 1000 CE a warlike people called Tchudes (or Tsjuderen?), pillage and plunder from others in northern Scandinavia. As they brutally exterminate a Sámi family in a remote area, teenage son Aigin the last of his family being dragged to a hole in the ice and plunged under, but escapes the slaughter. He evades capture and killing at the hands of these marauders and skis overland to a far-off Sámi camp. Alas, his hosts are worried he might not have been able to hide his tracks, and fearful of these bloodthirsty people, the Sámi decide to flee to the coast. Aigin stays to avenge his family's murder. Unfortunately, the Tschudes capture him before he can do anything, and force him to lead them to the other Sámi. Although forced to guide them, Aigin has a surprise plan to annihilate these savage people before they can reach the Saami camp. This ancient coming-of-age story is very well told, with the main dialog in Sámi, translated to the viewer's language, while the words of the Tschudes, not translated, are left for the viewer to contemplate..People who lack any experience with indigenous original peoples who remain evolved with the land that has supported them for millennia, NEED to experience this look at life from the perspective of a culture unpolluted by the corruption of external forces and religion."Raste," a Noaidi of the Sámi village where Aigin escapes to, speaks to the young man about his anger and desire to avenge himself and his family against the Tchudes who killed them: Raste: Thoughts of revenge are darkening your mind. Remember, we are but parts of the whole, parts of the infinite brotherhood. The Tchudes have forgotten it. Don't you forget, lad. Aigin: I'm not part of any brotherhood, I am alone. Raste: You may feel that way now, but trust me, you too are bound to this infinite brotherhood . . . . with unbreakable bonds. Listen and remember what I say. This morning, I saw the reindeer bull for the third time in my life. The first time I saw it, I was your age. The second time I was in the prime of my life; and today is the third time. Listen now, and remember. The reindeer has come for the last time. Aigin: And what does that mean? Raste disappears.I recommend a read of wikipedia's article on the Sámi/Saami people, the English version has links to the article in sixty-four other languages, including Suomi, and the unrelated regional languages Svenska, Norsk nynorsk, Norsk bokm?l, Nederlands, and Dansk.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pathfinder is a Scandinavian fable set sometime in the 10th or 11th century involving a young indigenous Sami boy, whose family are massacred by the warring Tchudes, and flees to a nearby village to help defend them from the approaching pillagers. There is confrontation between some of the villagers and the boy, as some believe that they are no match for the superior in numbers Tchude barbarians, while a few others are willing to stay behind to help the boy fight them off.Once the Tchudes do arrive, the boy is taken prisoner and agrees to help them find a way through a pass in the mountains to get to the coastal village that the other Sami have fled to. But the boy has a final trick up his sleeve that will hopefully save them....It's a timeless coming of age tale, and of good versus evil. But what makes it unique is the frigid Arctic setting, as well as the insight into the native culture of the Sami people. Most interesting is the undercutting theme of interconnected destinies, as the pathfinder Raste informs the boy how important it is to find strength in others, even when it seems you are on your own in the darkest of times. No man is truly free, and the pathfinder serves as a beacon for guiding the boy to his destiny to save the village, as well as lead the Tchudes on their path to self destruction. Raste understands how the heart of nature is intertwined with that of his people, as shown by his sighting of the reindeer bull.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norwegian-Sami screenwriter and director Nils Gaup's feature film debut which he also wrote, is based on an old Sami legend and was the first Sami feature length film ever produced. It was shot on locations at Kautokeino, Finmarksvidda in Northern Norway and is a Norwegian production which was produced by Norwegian producer John M. Jacobsen. It tells the story about Aigin, a young man who after returning home from a hunting trip witnesses his family being murdered by a group of Russian chudes dressed in black. Though trying to hide, he is discovered some of the men. Aigin manages to flee to his nearest neighbours and tell them what has happened, but a manhunt has begun and the chudes are right behind him.Distinctly and engagingly directed by Norwegian filmmaker Nils Gaup, this historic period film which narrated mostly from the protagonist's point of view, draws a moving portrayal of the internal conflicts a young man experiences when he becomes a pathfinder for the people who killed his family. While notable for it's poignant and atmospheric milieu depictions, brilliant cinematography by renowned Norwegian cinematographer Erling Thurman-Andersen (1945-2002), costume design, editing by Danish film editor Nils Pagh Andersen and use of sound, this character-driven and mythical story about a, at that period in time, minority of indigenous people who are attacked by a group of villains once upon a time in the 11th century, depicts a dense and mindful study of character and contains a powerful score by Norwegian musician Marius Müller (1958-1999), Norwegian composer Kjetil Bjerkestrand and Sami-Finnish writer and musician Nils-Aslak Valkeapää (1943-2001).This finely paced and riveting journey through the highland winter landscapes of Northern Norway which is so rightfully considered one of the greatest Norwegian action films ever made, is impelled and reinforced by it's cogent narrative structure and the fine acting performances by Norwegian actor Mikkel Gaup, Icelandic actor Helgi Skúlason (1933-1996) and Norwegian actor Nils Utsi. A consistently involving and memorable drama which gained, among other awards, the Sutherland Trophy Nils Gaup at the British Film Institute Awards in 1989, the Amanda Award for Best Norwegian Film at the 4th Amanda Awards in 1988 and became the second Norwegian film succeeding Arne Skouen's "Nine Lives" (1957) that was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film at the 60th Academy Awards in 1988.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>familiar trappings in a fresh setting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Anyone in the business of storytelling should begin with a good story, which is precisely what Norwegian director Nils Gaup did for his Oscar nominated debut feature, adapting a thousand year old Scandinavian legend about a young boy who rescues a small community of fellow Laplanders from a horde of ruthless invaders. The setting may be exotic (the film was shot almost entirely above the Arctic Circle) but the basic mythic outline can be (and likely has been) translated anywhere, from the American West to "?a long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away". Certain elements are by now so familiar they might almost be clichés: the young hero, orphaned by an evil enemy (the Tchudes, dressed all in black and speaking a harsh, guttural language); his refuge with a likewise threatened nearby tribe, who see him as their savior; the medicine man who will guide him to wisdom; and so forth. Gaup knows enough not to embellish an already proved formula, and as a result his film offers brisk, uncomplicated entertainment, with action scenes as thrilling as anything coming out of Hollywood these days. But now that the legend is on film, will future generations of Lapp children learn it from their elders by simply renting a DVD?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The first time I saw this film was in the early Nineties on Spanish TV, and I absolutely loved it. It took many years before I got a video copy that I still have, but in recent years I never could find it in DVD here in Britain, which is a shame. I understand that the film was not widely released in cinemas in its time and remains mostly unknown to the general public, which is another shame. "Ofelas" is remarkable for its use of locations, the cinematography and the neat ambiance sounds that fill each shot, making it a real treat to the spectator who almost can feel the snow crunching under his feet and the icy cold air blowing in his face. The Norwegians made a beautiful film that surpasses in storytelling and historical detail Hollywood blockbusters such as "White Fang" or "Robin Hood" (Kevin Costner), made with multi-million budgets and big stars and enjoying expensive publicity campaigns. Mikkel Gaupp is excellent on his role. Both his boyish looks and the naiveté of the character at the beginning of the story make his performance solidly credible as a nobody turned overnight into a hero for his own survival. He weeps when seeing the carnage of his family, then panics when discovered by the killers and then runs desperately for his life without performing any astonishing stunts with the special effects that we have seen so often in Hollywood movies with similar plots. In 82 minutes we get a story that is poetic and full of action and suspense. And a breathtaking catalogue of views of real Lapland, with the Aurora Borealis included, instead of a studio fake with synthetic snow and background shots or plain CGI crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of a few good Norwegian movies.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Many foreigners might be put off by the idea of watching a movie with subtitles, especially in countries like Spain, France, Italy and Germany where movies usually are dubbed into the native language (which is not the case in Norway). Even though the movie is produced in Norway, the cast is Sami and the Sami language is used throughout the entire film. Therefore most Norwegians find themselves watching this movie with subtitles anyway, which makes the plot in itself more believable.Who else is better to tell a story from a Sami legend than a Sami writer/director? For its time the movie was, and still is, outstanding, only to be matched by "Orions Belt".Personally I think the acting could have been better, but the plot was great, and so was the directing as well."Ofelas"/"Veiviseren" is truly a Sami/Norwegian treasure of culture! 9 out of 10 ~</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie was remade in 2006 as "Pathfinder" in America. I watched this movie before I rented the remake. The director from the original intended to shoot the movie on 65mm, but didn't have the money to do so. So he did three blow-ups on 70mm of the film. One of these copies was shown in Karlsruhe and I watched it! I can only recommend to watch it that way! The story is quite simple and can be read here at IMDb. What is quite amazing is the complex story/character arc of the main person. Of course there are still some flaws in the storytelling and the usual holes in the plot ... or that's how you could interpret them. Because those flaws (maybe they are more character flaws?) are pushing this movie into another level (imo). Just don't expect (Hollywood) Blockbuster action here ...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>heaps of snow, heaps of praise</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I had not heard of Pathfinder (Ofelas) before it was screened on television tonight. My first impression was WOW! The photography and soundtrack were both stunning. The story is straightforward, set in 10th century Lapland, a boy witnesses the slaughter of his family by a marauding tribe, who then proceed to pursue him. He takes refuge in a small peaceful settlement, but it is not long before long the brutal kllers of his family catch up. This film is wonderful in all aspects, everyone involved in its production deserve the highest praise. The film is short but I guarantee you will feel exhausted watching this pursuit in the snow. I would like to recommend Shadow of the Wolf directed by Jacques Dorfman starring Lou Diamond Phillips and Toshiro Mifune another snow spectacular set amongst the Innuit tribe.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A wonderful adventure - love story, coming-of-age, mystic experience! I learned something as I was entertained. How do the Laps live in that cold??!! Probably more interesting to boys than girls; however, my wife throughly enjoyed it too.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Original but slow</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>?Pathfinder" has a highly original setting: Scandinavia around the year 1000 (okay, I took that from the IMDb plot summary). Most actors are butt ugly, got snow in their mustaches and speak very little. The movie is actually pretty timeless. You almost can't tell that it was made in the 80's as there are absolutely no fashion clues or outdated special effects in the movie.So, this movie is definitely something you don't see every day. Unfortunately, it's also incredibly slow. This whole world of these ancient people seems alien, which is appropriate, of course. This is an alien time after all. The problem is that the viewer is never really that caught up in the story. We cannot really identify with the characters and there isn't exactly a lot of suspense.All this makes "Pathfinder" a movie that is worth checking out, if you get the chance. However, it's not the hidden gem that many reviewers make it out to be, but rather something for a rainy Sunday afternoon.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Since there's a remake of this film coming soon (from what I've read, it's no good), I thought I'd write a comment on the original.I am part Saami, and I've lived in the Saami capital, Guovdageaidnu, all my life. This means that I know more about this film than any of you, so listen up! I have watched this film many times, not because it's good, but because I had to since it's a part of school education here.Knowing the language, I must say the dialog is pretty bad. But that shouldn't bother you guys, since all that needs to sound/ look good to you, is the translation.The acting is mediocre, but that doesn't necessarily ruin a film.This film is too close to me, for me to be able to say it's good. But for foreigners this film is all but bad, rather exotic. So I guess there's a good chance you'll like it if you're foreign... so see it!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nice sauna scene and some nice villains.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The villains were looking for nothing other than some prime sami villages to plunder. However, they didn't take into account the Steven Segal of the North. He managed to out run them on one ski, and this made the maniac leader of the tsjude bad men really annoyed. I think his face would scare anyone half to death.So in between this and the end, we see that the samis are a spiritual folk, with great respect for nature. They are starved, and have to kill a bear to get through winter. The man who killed him, gets a magical aura around himself, and his tribe mates can look at him only through a metal ring.By now, the villains, are interested in getting to the large sami sijdda (village) by the coast. However, they have no GPS system, so the steven segal-sami-man offers to show them the way. His girlfriend waits for him at the coast, but she does not believe that he is a traitor. But can she know for sure? The climax scene involves no violence, in stead we get a huge avalanche killing all the raiders, leaving them buried under tons of ice, snow and rock. And Steven Segal was the man who led them into it. He sacrificed his life so that the other samis could live.In the dying moments of the film, as the samis ponder the great sacrifice a creature moves outside the lavvo, and the young, handsome ofelas (pathfinder) enters. The girl smiles.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Powerful Movie About Manhood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a beautiful movie about men and spiritually and what it means to be a spiritual man. The idea of a higher good; universal truths and the role of man on Earth. Man has always been the protector and warrior and this movie portrays that duty in its purest form. This is masculinity distilled and captured sublimely on film. Every male should watch this movie, particularly young American men who are told how horrible they are and how wrong it is to act as their nature dictates by the media and academia. I plead every father in this country to watch this with their sons. This is one of those movies that is great because it transcends simple entertainment and increases the amount of good in the world every time it is watched.</fullReview>
