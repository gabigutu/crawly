		<shortDescription>Good action scenes wasted on terrible story, acting and editing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What a waste.The only redeeming feature of this movie were the well made action scenes (not all were good, but overall there were more enjoyable fight sequences than boring ones).The story is clichéd and predictable. The acting is terrible (the main role is so horribly sketched out that you can barely blame the actor, the supporting roles all make a mark for their blandness). The main couple have no chemistry, the dialog is UN-enjoyably bad and the editing looks like it was done by a blind man. Scenes start and end with absolutely no flow. One scene was particularly bad (I wont spoil it for you, suffice to say its the one where the Indians charge into battle against the hero's wishes). That is the only scene when I laughed in the movie, and its supposed to be a sad/rousing scene.The trailer of this film looked really pretty, but then again the consisted of mostly the fight scenes so I'm not surprised at all. The director seems to have had a good eye for visuals, but his effort has ended there.Pathfinder = 5/10 Five for the fight scenes.I was trying to find a path out of the theater at many times during the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worse than I could have ever imagined.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not quite sure how director Marcus Nipsel and company managed to take this screenplay, which had potential, and suck every ounce of life, drama and coolness out of it. They did, though. Pathfinder proves to be another completely forgettable historical action movie at best, generic as hell, right down to your cookie-cutter indestructible action hero (played by Karl Urban).My biggest gripe with the film, and I have many, comes from how long it was pushed back for. If I remember correctly, it was first slated for release in January of '06. It was delayed well over a year, and I assumed that the crew were editing, re shooting and doing other things that might make the film better. I should have remembered what happens when one assumes. In reality, they were just waiting around for a good time to release the film, because it obviously didn't improve in that year and a half. At one point, they literally insert stock footage of an avalanche instead of creating their own CGI (or real) avalanche. Who are you guys kidding? There are about six words worth of meaningful dialog in this film. The Vikings don't even look human, nobody ever really explains why they're going out of their way to kill everyone. The Native Americans are portrayed as weak and stupid, little more than target practice. This film just lets the arrows fly and the heads roll.The acting is horrendous as well. Its got some cool action scenes, but thats about it. It might have been a blessing having so little dialog in Pathfinder, because if how brutal the little that was present proved to be. It was like, Covenant bad. The script literally sounds like it was written by a child.Overall, Pathfinder wastes its potential and fails to prove itself worthy of anyone's time, let alone anyone's money. No amount of good action could have saved this film from its fate.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One Lost</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Twenty years ago, there was a terrific Norwegian action film called "Pathfinder" set in the Dark Ages and dealing with a boy whose family is slaughtered by marauders; villagers take him in. When the boy has grown into a young man, the marauders return, affording our hero the chance to repay his benefactors by avenging himself on the bad guys. It was brisk and chilly and had a real sense of mythic resonance. It was good.Here, now, is another film called "Pathfinder," virtually identical in plot. And it is everything the original was not: muddled, ugly, pointless, silly, incoherent, overly familiar and exceedingly dull. It is not good.German director Marcus Nispel, who remade "The Texas Chainsaw Massacre" a couple of years back and likely is working on a lousy new version of something else now, has an eye: The film is handsome. But he has no ear or brain -- or at least not those parts of the brain that deal with such niceties as narrative, character, dialogue and logic.Karl Urban (Eomer to "Lord of the Rings" fans) stars a Nordic boy raised by Native Americans after being left behind in a Viking raid of North America. Probably the filmmakers (a dozen producers are credited) thought the introduction of Native Americans allowed for soulful depths. Actually, it allows for painfully dim clichés about prophecy, spirits and discovering "who you are" -- as patronizing in its way as the most insult-ridden cowboys-and-Indians movie of the '30s.Other characters include a heroic love interest (Moon Bloodgood), a wise elder (Russell Means) and a mute sidekick (Kevin Loring). These brief descriptions are about all the depth these characters ever acquire.Most of "Pathfinder" is given over to ridiculous chases and fights that remind you how skillful "Apocalypto" was at similar scenes. Someone who had never seen an action movie wouldn't credit a minute of it. In a way, it's perfect: You can't imagine anyone seeing this mess and not feeling lesser for the experience.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not a bad B-movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is pretty good B-movie. If you want subtle plot and dialog then you should have figured out from the trailer and the poster that this show is not for you.Yes, it appears to be inspired by a Frazetta painting (see Death Dealer) and is surely derivative of Conan and Tarzan. But how long has it been since a good Conan or Tarzan movie.Lots of gore, lots of decapitations (but as Joe Bob would say, all necessary for the plot) lots of low key lighting to make the special effects easier to pull off but then again, it's not a chick flick.If only we still had drive in movies.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Little Story Well Made</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I have read many comments here that hated the film. One of my friends who accompanied me to the screening disliked it as well. He thought it was a waste of time, too. Unfortunately, many viewers, such as my friend, miss the point, as they in fact look for a point.Unlike the new trend of films of this era, "Pathfinder" did not submit to the theme of freedom, the political freedom. None of the characters pronounce the word freedom, such as the main character of the film, "300," who shouted it out loud. Instead, the main character of the film, Ghost, battles himself and "his demons" in order to find his own freedom and to fit in. Ghost tries to look for the peace he was raised in."Pathfinder" challenges the modern stage of film-making, and re-introduces a somewhat Western ideology that John Wayne's "The Searchers" had introduced in 1956. Therefore, the audience has to place themselves in a position to examine each character-groups' point of view. In that respect, the film offers some depth to the little story that is filled with violent battle scenes.The battle scenes are enjoyable. There is a certain level of combat cruciality. That is also a part of the little depth the story gives us. Thus, the issue of good and evil surfaces in the film in how battle is a balancing aspect of the life each side's lives.Of course since this film is trying to appeal to the general audience, a certain degree of love and romance is involved. The love and romance of this film is actually not all-so-bad, although I am not quite found of. However, it brings a little strength into the issue of choice of life Ghost must endear.I think "Pathfinder" lives up to its own introduction, "Legend." Therefore, it is filmed as such, an old legend. The film-makers saw it as such, and they wanted to let us see it too. I know I did. The dialogue(s) is not the perfect one, but must resemble the simplicity of older times. I do not think this is the greatest film ever made; however, it is a well made film which I think people will enjoy its little story, if they can go past the neo-ideology and "what's the point?" issue.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Vikings</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nipsel and company basically hybridized the structure of Dances with Wolves with a not-quite-historical fiction (more like radical speculation) plot about interactions between Norsemen and Native Americans during the 12th century A.D.Ghost (Karl Urban) is a Norse boy left behind aboard a wrecked ship. He is adopted by the Clan of the Dog (the dogs who cohabitate with this tribe are historically inaccurate, but that's just one of many historical transgressions). As he grows up, Ghost's obvious difference and his history become something of a stumbling block for him, but he works hard to overcome them in order to be accepted by his adoptive people. Eventually, it seems, he must confront the demons of his past, and unfortunately, so must the Clan of the Dog.Pathfinder is played well by Russell Means, and Ghost's love interest - Starfire - is nicely portrayed by Moon Bloodgood. Urban has great physical talent, but this story did not lend itself to testing his ability to create drama and mood, so there isn't much to say about his performance. Likewise, most of the Norse characters were so under-developed and one-dimensional that it is impossible to comment on the performances involved.Although the story relies on stereotypes to develop both its Norse and Native American characters, since so little is actually known about the Norse colonies, this seems forgivable. What is not really forgivable, in my opinion, is the reiteration of the trope established in Dances with Wolves and other similar works which suggests that it takes a European to effectively fight off Europeans. Although the characterizations of the protagonists in both films are adequate to explain their behavior, the character and behavior of the Native Americans attached to them is less well developed, and there is a lingering, inaccurate and disturbing shadow of inferiority implied in their apparent inability to strategize and effectively lead in combat.However, Pathfinder refuses to touch reality with any length of pole, so, sit back and enjoy the action, costumes and sets.The film contains a lot of violence, most of which is convincingly shot. The costuming is excellent, and the sets are lovely. if you can get past the problems - which are several - you may just enjoy it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>visually arresting</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pathfinder was not nearly as bad as many people are making it out to be. True, the editing was mediocre at best, with the seasons clearly out of whack. There were some pretty odd incongruencies with language as well. The filmmakers relied on some trite Native American imagery and stereotypes...But Pathfinder was obviously never about the plot or silly Viking outfits. Ultimately I think the filmmakers wanted to impress upon the viewers the starkness of the landscape of "uncivilized" North America, and how the people who lived there survived. One of the best lines in the movie is delivered when Ghost tells his lady friend that the Vikings know eternal winter, but "don't know our spring." I think the movie, in its own kind of botched way, did a good job conveying the awe, reverence and fear that the people who lived in N.A. had for the seasons and the natural environment.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Uninspired action movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Based on a 1987 Norwegian film, "Pathfinder" stars Karl Urban as Ghost, a young Viking who was raised by a tribe of Native Americans after being left behind by his Viking father after a raid on the new world. Years later, a new set of Vikings set foot on their land, and Ghost feels obliged to defend his foster people.While the film's acting overall is as frigid as the environment, and that the actors are playing no more than stock characters where, "Pathfinder" makes no pretense in presenting itself as a more-brawn-than-brain kind of film.Granted it's perhaps the case, but the direction of Marcus Nispel is heavily uninspired. Whereas recent films like Mel Gibson's "Apocalypto" and Zack Snyder's "300" prove that a film with minimal plot can have its moments if it can build up on tension and sustain a viewer's attention, "Pathfinder" fails to do so. Action scenes are at most moderately entertaining and lacks a kind of punch that would elevate it into a cinematic status. Attempts to impart emotions fall flat and there's no chemistry between Urban and Moon Bloodgood who plays the the obligatory role of the female sidekick.Overall, "Pathfinder" is a film sorely lacking in impact, that it would leave the viewer in the cold more than it would excite.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Hilarious!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This was quite possible the worst movie I have ever seen. Ridiculous plot, no character development, absurdly unbelievable: this film gives up on the suspension of disbelief about 5 minutes into it. Sure, it has some decent action and cinematography, but as a whole, this movie is a joke. A hilarious joke. I can best describe it as an hour and a half of Walker: Texas Ranger blended with Army of Darkness and a sprinkle of randomness.Here is the plot: insane, genocidal Vikings with apparently nothing better to do in Scandinavia sail to America to trash the place and kill wantonly. Unlike the Vikings of history, who at least targeted plunder to make their raiding worthwhile, these bad guys just like to destroy stuff: baskets of cranberries, Native American women, whatever. This guy "Ghost," (cleverly named for his pale skin) who is himself a Viking, embarks upon a quest for vengeance upon the evil Vikings, because he identifies more with the natives than his former people. Along the way, a random retarded native decides to follow him in his quest and gets killed, for no apparent purpose. The love interest also tags along, occasionally helping, and this old native "The Pathfinder," who is apparently some sort of badass, shows up to provide some wisdom ("If you cannot defeat the bear, use the bear's strength against him.") and also to get killed. The inexplicably idiotic Vikings then take Ghost as a guide to the next village, presumably to wreak more senseless destruction. Ghost tricks them into getting caught under an avalanche, and everyone lives happily ever after. The End.Sound pitiful? That's because it is. I must say, however, that the final scene of the movie is so overwhelmingly cliché that I honestly laughed the entire walk from my seat in theatre to my car in the parking lot--a distance of about 200 yards. It was that laughable.That said, I do not regret seeing the movie, as it isn't often that one gets to view a serious contender for the worst movie of his life. Hope this helps.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not as bad as some have painted it to be</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If you went to see the movie expecting something like Mel Gibson's Apocalypto, you will be disappointed obviously. But why would you expect it to be Apocalypto if you've seen the trailer? It tells a mythical tale of a legendary Norseman who was raised by native Americans. They called him ghost. And it's this ghost who ended up protecting the tribes from the destruction of the Viking Clang who shared the same lineage with him. The plot line is just that simple. What kept me entertained was the action sequence, absolutely stunning cinematography and the overall presentation and atmosphere. The overall tune of the movie is dark, mythical and menacing, fit perfectly well for the theme. Vikings are presented more like beast than man, with giant statue and equally ghastly giant armors and weapons.Some may argue that the vikings in this movie kill senselessly without any purpose. Does having a purpose makes evil more sensible? I have good news for people who are looking for reasons behind evil: they all have purposes and reasons, so don't waste time seeking one for them. Bad news for you: it absolutely makes no difference! Throughout human history, all aggressors had plenty of reasons to invade, ravish and destroy other culture and lives, the list goes from Vikings to Hitler... and it will probably go on forever. But does having reasons and purposes to kill make the killing more sensible? Absolutely not.In this movie, Vikings are symbolic evil. Giving it a reason to kill doesn't make any differences as I stated above: they all have reasons, pick one and get over with it. On the other hand, the movie was trying to suggest that not only there's this battle of good and evil going on in the physical world, there's also a battle of hate and love in one's heart. When asked: who would won, Ghost was given the answer: the one you feed the most. It's a very interesting theme that I wish the director would explore a little bit deeper. But in the end, violence prevailed the screen time. The thought of inner struggle and loftier redemption was lost in the midst of killing and vengeance. No sin was forgiven and no bad deeds went unpunished. Though it's a more satisfying end, but a shallow one.Overall, I enjoyed the movie for what it is. I'm not looking for complicated plot nor deeper character development. For an action movie, its visually stunning, fast paced and immersing. It kept me interested throughout the 90 minutes and left me pondering about some unfulfilled premises. It's not as bad as some have painted it to be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Historically there are just mistakes over mistakes, with things that shouldn't be there at the time an so on.. so I assumed it was entirely a fiction and look for the action...So I was happy when fight start 20 minutes after the beginning of the movie but this is nonsense...the "savior" got some skills coming from nowhere and the action is quite lame.. It's a bit like Hercules the series but longer..Please note that some of the blood is CGIHere is the story: Vikings, barbarians that only cross the Atlantic to kill people for fun, let a boy behind. This boy, as Vikings seems to be a superior race than Native Americans, become quickly the strongest and most good-looking person. Unfortunately, 20 years later, The Vikings used their GPS to come back to the exact same spot where they had their KBRF Party (=Kill Blood Raaaahh Fun). As usual, a whole tribe of Native Americans against the Vikings lose easily but 1 man will easily beat them. After all, they are only Vikings and deep inside, if they are doing that, it's because they are missing Ikea... ************ ******* *******NEXT - CONTAIN SPOILER ******* ******* ************Native Americans are all topless, then after 30 minutes and 500 meters away from the camp, you realized there is snow everywhere...? At that point you realized that if you go 500 hundreds meters away from sea level, you end up on top of a mountain.. Oh well, at least, the savior can slide with a shield when Vikings chase him using sleighs as bobsleighs..Excellent quote such as: Savior - "Leave and you may live, stay and you will die" [...] Old guy - "What would you do?" Savior - "Stay and kill as many as I can"All the most predictable line of a B action movie are there: - The "Go,I'll stay behind" one - The "I was about to get caught but the good guy arrive and put his hand on my mouth so I don't scream" one - The "I kill my friend that is being tortured" one - The "because I'm a girl I cannot fight and will hit you in the balls" one - The "oh no, I'm bleeding everywhere,surprisingly I'm dying" one - The "let's kill everybody but keep the hero(s) alive otherwise the movie is finished" one - The "I don't accept failure and I'm a bad guy so I kill my partner" one - The "I can always say the right lines before dying" one - The "I'll sacrifice myself but I know I will never die as I'm the hero" one - The "I won't talk but when you threaten to cut the hand of my girlfriend to make me talk I will react at the last minute" one - The "I'm a prisoner but I'll keep it real and will try to beat you up when you're not talking to me nicely and that will end up in you beating me" one - The "I have a very good strategy that is so predictable" one - The "you can't die if you had not fulfill your destiny" one - The "hero and main bad guy never die" one</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A little boy is left in a strange land and he's adopted by an Indian family. But a merciless, ambitious and cruel barbarians(Clancy Brown, Ralf Moeller, among them) suddenly appear and they are cruelly murdered . The starring(Karl Urban) observes the massacre from a distance and he manages to flee these murderers and reaches a village with other Natives whose inhabitants are worried if he has been able to hide his leads. Afraid of the violent savage warriors ,they decide to flee. Meanwhile the protagonist falls in love with a charming Native(Bloodgood). The young stays alone to revenge his families killers but he gets captured by the Vikings. Unfortunately , they get him before he can do anything and force him to lead them to the other Indians. He guides them and agrees to lead to the hiding place of his fellow villagers but he has a scheme to destroy the cutthroats barbarians before reach the camp.It's the second version based on ancient folk-tale from Lapland, the first and classic version was directed by Nils Gaup in 1988, winning several prizes. This new adaptation is an exciting picture plenty of action, thrills, chills, roller-coaster ride, violence and breathtaking fights. The brutal Vikings with horned helmets deliver the goods, their appearance is spectacular and creepy, including the majestic horses doing pirouettes. Furthermore the astonishing killings are gruesome executed and grisly graphic. Special mention to Russell Means , he was born Lakota Sioux, a good actor Native American, he along with Graham Greene, Rodney A Grant, Tantoo cardinal, Eric Schweitz and Wes Studi appear in all movies about Indian themes. The evil Vikings are characterized in similar style to the classic 'Conan' by John Milius, as when at the beginning appeared James Earl Jones in an unforgettable scenes . The sombre photography by Daniel Pearl with a sort of never-ending dawn and dusk time is truly awesome. It's a kind of light mingled in a moody and foggy atmosphere. Many frames including the combats and cliffs scenes are made in a ¨300¨ style adding computer generator backgrounds. Stirring and evocative musical score by Jonathan Elias. Stunning and gripping realization by Marcus Nispel. He's a video hits director and expert on terror genre such as he proved ¨ Friday the 13th, Frankestein, Texas chainsaw massacre¨ but none of his movies have been based on original plot.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vikings and Indians just got less cool</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Here we have a movie about a white guy who is raised by Indians and ends up choosing them over his own people. Sound familiar? It should, because it's the basically the same plot device used in The Last Samurai (with Japanese people instead of Indians), Tarzan (with jungle animals instead of Indians), The Last of the Mohicans (with Indians this time), and countless other movies, except that most of those movies managed not to suck. Speaking of which, who remembers the scene in The Last of the Mohicans where the guy who acts like a jerk the whole time because he's hopelessly in love with the lead female character sacrificed himself so that the other good guys could get away, and was then shot to death by his friends who wanted to put him out of his misery because the bad guys were burning him alive? Well the EXACT same thing happens in this movie. The only difference is that it's Vikings that are burning the guy alive instead of a rival tribe of Indians. Now you may be thinking, "maybe they never saw The Last of the Mohicans, and it's just a coincidence." Not so...and how do I know this? Because the actor that plays the old/wise Indian in this movie is THE SAME F***ING GUY FROM THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS. You'd think he would have told the producers, "Hey, I made this exact same movie in 1992 where I played this exact same role and we did this exact same scene, except that when we did it that time it didn't have Vikings in it and we did it in a way that didn't suck." Or actually, maybe he's the reason that scene is in this movie. Maybe he told the producers, "Hey guys, we should totally have a scene where the guy who acts like a jerk the whole movie because he is in love with the lead female character nobly sacrifices himself for the good of everybody else and then gets burned alive, but then his friends shoot him as they are fleeing so that he won't have to suffer any longer. Trust me, we have to have that scene or this movie will be terrible. I'm not doing this movie if we don't have that scene." Basically, this movie is such a rip off of other epic action movies that it's not even funny. It's kind of like watching a lame child limp along and try to play with the other kids...he's trying to do what everyone else is doing, but somehow it's just not working for him. It's actually kind of hard to pinpoint why this movie doesn't really work. If you break it down to its essential ingredients, it actually sounds pretty cool: - Vikings and Indians fighting each other ? check - Gratuitous sex scene with hot Indian girl ? check - Little kids getting their heads bashed in with axes and maces ? check And yet for some reason, this movie totally sucks. What's worse is that it doesn't even suck of its own accord; it copies other movies and then sucks at it. But if you like scenes where a guy who acted like a jerk the whole movie because he's in love with the lead female character redeems himself by sacrificing himself and getting burned alive until his friends shoot him to put him out of his misery, then this is the shameless rip off you've been waiting for.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is not as bad as some say. Yes, the editing is rubbish, the scenes have no flow and sometimes is confusing. Yes, the seasons are crazy, in one scene it's snowing, the next one is not, then snow again, then not...And yes, the script isn't great either, very poor. The Vikings are shown as killing machines with no purpose and the Indians afraid of those new weapons the vikings carry: swords.At the beginning of the movie it is stated that it is a legend and so it's shown as such. Do not expect a great story, just a simple one with some good fights, a big gore and a lot of running. I also thought some scenes were very dark and so can't really see who's killing who.But all in all, it isn't that bad, especially if you like Karl Urban, showing muscular chest and gorgeous face. He is one of those actors who people don't really talk about, but he is one of the most handsome. His acting is not bad, just has a bad script. He does make you feel kind of sorry for him at times. So I give it 6/10, as it contains some good photography and action packed scenes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Though it does not qualify as top-notch cinema it was an enjoyable watch.Anyone that goes into this film thinking it was going to be a standard "Viking" movie will disappointed. It is a legend told from the point of view of the native population that lived in the north eastern part of north America. Thus the vikings are bigger, nastier, etc than what we might be used to. They are monsters. They look like it, and they act like it.Others have mentioned that the natives are portrayed as weak, or stupid. Think of it from this point of view. These are the very first people they have ever encountered that use metal weapons, and wear metal armor. They have really no defense against them, but just like people all over Europe they fought the vikings in defense of their homes, and died.Some great fight scenes, and panoramas, but it fails in the editing. The film is so dark that you lose track of things often, and cannot tell who is fighting, or how many there are.The script is first grade, and I mean written at a first grade schoolchild's level, but who goes to a b-movie actioner for great dialog? Overall I was a bit disappointed, but not so much that I felt the need to leave, or other such protest. It was a great idea poorly executed.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie must have been made as an insult to every cultural heritage it involves. Being a Norweigian myself, and having the Viking heritage i get really insulted by the way Vikings are shown in this film. I'm pretty certain the producers have only the faintest idea of what a viking really was. And I can only imagine how a native American must feel about this movie.I do not consider myself a movie critic, I can usually watch a movie and forgive just about any logic flaw and still enjoy the movie. But this one I really can't forgive. First of all there is the storyline (if any), then there is the fact that the vikings have horses and look like some characters from spawn or something. (Vikings never really used horses in war, and never actually brought them with them over the bloody Atlantic. And they sure as hell didn't dress up like some cartoon characters from hell. with horns and tattoo's and so on) Second there is the dialog's, every line performed by the Native Americans are flat, emotionless and sounds dubbed. Its like they made it all in one go. All the lines performed by the vikings seems like gibberish, except a couple of words here and there. The only thing they have put any time and effort into it seems is the totally mindless violence and scenery (witch is beautiful BTW.) Now Vikings were violent, but this is absolutely idiotic. They were raiders, not out performing genocide just to build a house somewhere. This is ridicules and I'm tired and angry. There's a shitload more I could say, but its just to much...</fullReview>

He had so much beard, helmet, paint, and just plain armor and you couldn't tell who he was. Only way I knew him was because of his voice and Eyes. One of his best underrated and too soon canceled programs the Showtime series "Carnivale" showed just how good he is at being bad but at the same time kinda good. Anyway back to the movie, it's main problem is the awful editing, It had some pretty decent action scenes but they just cut so quickly and you never get a hold on what you are seeing! My other complaint is that all the Indians speak English. I can understand this happening 20 years ago, but are we really that lazy that we can't read subtitles? Especially in this day in age, do we have to put all films in English? It sounds ridiculous and remember "Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon" did over 100 mil. U.S. and it was subtitled! The script also seemed repetitive sometimes as well. And whose Idea was it to not give the main character any lines 15 minutes into the movie? Well just don't ask too much of the film and it should be OK.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Norway is not well known for making better films than Hollywood, but in this case they are. The Pathfinder is historical vomit and should never have been made under those circumstances. Vikings with bigger horns than swords. They looked like wrestlers on steroids. The action was boring, predictable and a mere copy of action sequences in b-films. The photography and lighting was cool. Except that the photography was so caught up in following the rules, that it was like watching a music video. And who wants to watch a two-hour music video? All in all, very little excitement. If you want to watch a better pathfinder - find the Norwegian version "Veiviseren". I got to go puke!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Follows the path of mediocrity</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>It's impossible not to think of 300 when you're watching Pathfinder. Both are very loose accounts of historical battles that seem to be inspired more by video games than history. To be fair, this movie was filmed and finished long before the film adaptation of 300 was, as Pathfinder has been sitting on the studio's shelf for almost two years before finally being released. This is also where the similarities come to an end. 300 was a gloriously stupid movie that still managed to entertain thanks to some striking visuals and well-staged sequences. Pathfinder, on the other hand, is so murky and muddy you almost feel like you're watching the movie through a dirty window at times. There's very little story to speak of, and no real characters to give anything resembling emotion. All the movie gives us is some ineptly edited action sequences, and a lot of over the top gore that isn't even presented very well to begin with.The film attempts to depict a struggle between a noble Native American tribe and some vicious Vikings. Because the Native Americans are the heroes, they speak English, while the evil Vikings are sometimes subtitled, but usually speak in grunts and bellowing demonic roars that sound like they were lifted from a Godzilla movie. While exploring the ruins of a Viking ship, a woman of the Native American tribe discovers an abandoned boy that the enemy left behind. She takes him back to her village and raises him amongst her people, where he grows up to be an appropriately muscular and personality-free young man who goes by the name of Ghost (Karl Urban from Doom) because of his pale skin. When Ghost's original clan returns 15 years later to continue pillaging and plundering the innocent tribal people, he teams up with a small band of survivors to fight back. Numerous heads are removed from their proper place above the neck, blood and limbs fly at the camera, and we can't help but realize how dull and uninspired it all is.The only surprising thing about Pathfinder comes during the ending credits, when we realize that the characters we have been watching for the past 90 minutes or so actually had names. Aside from the heroic Ghost, I do not recall a single other character's name being mentioned in the dialogue. Kind of makes it hard to figure out who played who at the end, since the entire cast is made up of faceless drones who all look alike and exist simply to be killed in the film's many action sequences. Besides not having names until the very end of the movie, the characters don't seem to talk much either. I wouldn't be surprised to discover that dialogue makes up maybe 40 minutes (and that's being generous) of the film's running time. The lack of dialogue make the characters impossible to identify with or even understand their slightest motives. Things keep on happening, but it leaves absolutely no impression on us. When the characters do open their mouths, what they say is often so laughably bad that we look forward to them being silent again. Ghost may be the hero, but he doesn't say a single intelligent thing in the entire screenplay. You get the sense that he's the lead by default, rather than for his personality.All of this could have been forgiven if Pathfinder's action sequences were anything special. Unfortunately, director Marcus Nispel (2003's Texas Chainsaw Massacre remake) seems to have no idea how to stage or shoot a battle sequence successfully. He uses a lot of dramatic slow motion shots as the enemy approaches, and then whenever people actually start fighting, he suddenly shoots the battles so tight and so close to the action that we sometimes can't even tell what's going on. It's just a mess of blood and flying body parts that has been edited so sloppily that we can't tell who is decapitating who. A sequence where a man battles with a ferocious bear is particularly humorous in how badly the entire thing comes across. Since the fights make up a good portion of the story, I quickly lost interest and found myself asking why anyone would want to watch this. It is a 90 minute long black hole that sucks the time and money away from anyone foolish enough to venture into a cinema showing it. It can't be bothered to entertain or excite us, or even give us a very basic thrill. The film's visuals seem to have gotten about as much attention as the dialogue, and often look dark and bland.At the very least, Pathfinder is mercifully brief and manages to go in one ear and out the other without leaving too much of an impression. A lot of money was obviously put into the project, and I can't help but wonder where it all went. Watching this movie is a lot like watching money being burned right up there on the screen for no reason at all. It can't give us a reason as to why we're supposed to be entertained, so all we can do is wait for it to be over. When the end finally did come, I didn't feel relieved or happy. I actually felt about as indifferent as I did throughout the rest of the film. Pathfinder accomplishes nothing at all and gets exactly the kind of reaction it deserves.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karl Urban</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While it is true not all film directors can envision and extract the best from the actors in their films, this Karl Urban performance was different from what we have seen him capable of as Vaako in The Chronicles of Riddick and as Eomer in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy. Karl as the Viking boy raised by an American Indian tribe gave a primitive and exciting performance but his portrayal of an Indian brave did lack some of the close up intensity we know he can deliver. In this story, the Vikings and American Indians were struggling for survival, so perhaps more action and less character development was called for. If battle minded Vikings landed on those shores, they would have taken the Indians by surprise, and then swarmed on foot, killing at will. If we were watching a film about Crazy Horse fighting George Custer at Little Big Horn, we wouldn't want character development to slow the pace of the battle; rich character development was not this film's goal. Having said that, we watch Karl Urban as he learns to conquer his fears and we see Pathfinder's daughter learn to trust Karl's character, the ghost. We have rich character development in film when those characters have more leisure time, not when they are fighting for the survival of their loved ones and their tribe!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The Worst Movie I've Ever Been Dumb Enough to Pay to See</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>If for any crazy reason you saw a trailer for Pathfinder and thought, "hey, cool, a viking movie!" stop right there. This movie totally blew; it blew long and hard and I got no satisfaction from it at all. I actually found myself thinking, "hmm.... should we just leave?" I've never walked out of a movie theater, I still haven't, but that was the closest I've ever come.The good parts- There was a scene where a guy got his face slashed and the eyeball fell out onto the ground and stared up at him... that was kinda cool. The viking costumes were kinda cool too. There was some good cinematography though- which leads me to the bad parts.The bad parts- The editing was absolutely abysmal. My 6 year old niece could've done better with some safety shears and a roll of scotch tape. There were these massive avalanche scenes and some nice panoramic shots that quite obviously did not come from the same stock as the rest of the movie (picture Ed Wood's stampeding buffalo) Most of the fight scenes were so badly edited you weren't sure who was slashing whom and if a hit was palpable or not. In one Ramboesque sequence I wasn't sure if there were 3 guys or 21 guys that all looked like the same three guys. The score, while not technically horrible in its own rite, did absolutely nothing to convey the story. Character development was mediocre when it wasn't null. Acting- bad to horrible- though in some cases I wasn't sure if it was the fault of the actors so much as the Lucas quality script. Did I mention the horrible washed out filters they used? For a while I thought maybe I was watching a cam of the movie. I can see why they used the filters they used, to a point, all the snow scenes could have gotten overwhelmingly bright; that's why you add some color though- or at least you should. Even some face paint or blood or something.Anyway, that's my rant.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very decent outdoor action flick!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Overwhelmed Native Americans armed with stone knives and tomahawks versus vicious, bloodthirsty Viking raiders clad in leather skins and furs, heavily armored, and wearing fearsome-looking headgear brandishing long steel swords, steel arrowheads, and very pointy maces attached to long, heavy chains. They ruthlessly spare no one.That pretty much sums up this worthwhile flick.Vikings had conducted numerous raids against European towns and cities during the period's Dark Ages, plundering their wealth and sometimes slaughtering their inhabitants. It's highly doubtful that Vikings had ever molested native Americans in our hemisphere. In reality, however, from the 16th century up to the late 19th century, settlers and soldiers from the western European countries (ironically perhaps, many of them descendants of the Viking raiders' victims) will eventually do to them what the Viking brutes had fictitiously wrought against the Indians in this movie.If you relish slaughterfest films such as those featured in the "Conan" and "Lord of the Ring" movies, then you'll like this one.</fullReview>

I found the characters likable, although I do not remember any quote concerning Ghost saying he was dieing and Pathfinder saying don't complain to me about it ????

		<fullReview>This movie was pretty good for the most part. Nice visuals and great action here and there. With that came a few pointless scenes (the strange dream sequences) and a conclusion that could have used a bit more sword fighting. The story, vikings have come to North America with seemingly no other purpose than to kill. What can stop them? Well looks like a storm took some out killing everybody on board a viking vessel leaving only a boy alive. He is taken into the care of the Indians. Well guess what? The vikings return and to their surprise one of the natives can take up a sword and slice and dice them. So what are you in store for, lots of head chopping and blood spurting. Unfortunately, at a certain point in the movie it gets a bit tiresome as the hero leads said vikings here and there trying to take out their numbers using nature. Not that it is all bad, but these scenes are a bit overlong and protracted. I preferred him hacking away with his sword. Still, it passed the time nicely and there were some great scenery shots too. The mountain looks particularly good. It probably helped that I watched this movie on blu-ray too, as this made the scenery shots really stand out. So despite its flaws and lack of any stars, for the most part this movie was entertaining and passed the time rather nicely.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This film was very good. I really think the viewers should not even think about it being a 'history lesson' at all. It is very much a Frazetta style picture, with almost exactly the 'Death Dealer' painting portrayed. So with that in mind this is a movie of possible unknown 'raiders' who are just *way* too brutal and they just want to kill and maim and they need to be stopped at all costs by the natives of the land ... and so they need a hero.I think this film is at least twice as good as "300", and here's why: although it has almost exactly the same 'graphic novel' look and feel, I like this film more because the storyline was very engaging, great characters, costumes, and cinematography. As you watch the movie each scene is distinct and new and really is memorable, and if you *really* squint your eyes you might even believe it (like 'Lord of the Rings'). There is lots of gore (heads lopped off, etc.) but that is the current styling of films anyways; I could do with a little less of it myself.I loved the natives and how they're portrayed. The costumes and sets are fantastic! There's a bit of their mysticism, and honour (warriors are very 'brave'), and real sense of tribal bonding and family.PS. Watch the DVD extras and you really 'get' where they were going, (who cares about the vikings having horns??). It's just a great movie, and for story this is great! Thanks to the cast and crew !</fullReview>

Vikings where no where near the brutish beasts they portrayed them as. They were however, the best traders across the seas. First Nations peoples were also excellent traders, I'm sure they would have got along. It was interesting that I heard POW WOW Drumming!! This is a style of drumming is from the plains first nations, not historically from Newfoundland. I teach first nations studies and one of my greatest pet peeves is the inaccuracy they still portray in movies. I really does not take that much research to find out what is or is not accurate to make a movie acceptable! In addition the idea of having a white spirit horse show the people when trouble was coming. Come on, there were no horses in North America until the Spaniards brought them over (after the Vikings visited). Why not a bear or for that matter a sacred skunk would have been more believable.

		<fullReview>Odin preserve us, where do I begin?? I'll try not to tread too much over what others have already said.Basically, this is just another Evil Whitey vs. Moral Brown Person movie. The Vikings (if we can even call them that without smirking) are psychopathic butchers while the Indians are sage and absurdly innocent. (For a picture of how the Indians really treated each other, see the movie Black Robe.) The Vikings "live by the sword and die by the sword," according to The Urbanator. Sure, we all know about how they loved to raid, but we seem to have lost sight of the fact that these guys sailed all across Europe, setting up trade lanes as far east as Russia and even entering the service of Byzantium as the Emporer's Varangian Guard, establishing the cities of Dublin and York (among others) along the way. You don't get more cosmopolitan than that. But that much nuance wouldn't make for good baddies, would it? No, they have to be mindless bullies. Even better, we'll make them slavers to boot; there's no better way, after all, to remind white people yet again of the horrible guilt that should weigh them down ad infinitum.Well, to hell with that, and to hell with racist movies like this one. Any amateur student of history knows that every group of people, of every color, have done everything under the sun to every other group of people, to include slaughter and slavery. White peoples get all the blame because they were more effective conquerers, period, and they conquered each other more than anyone else. There is no noble savage. And as far as the Indians go, well I'm sorry that you were too primitive to write down your own history, although that ignorance has served you well since now we don't know who YOU displaced to acquire your land (although advances in archeology may open that window in times to come). How can you really define someone as a "native," anyway? I know what you're thinking, dear reader: "Hey man, it's just a movie. It's fiction. Besides, some Vikings were psycho killers." Fine. Starting tomorrow I'm going to make 100 movies that depict black people as cannibals. It's fiction. Besides, in the deepest recesses of Africa, there still are some black cannibals. Think I could get away with making such movies?</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Underrated, atmospheric Viking saga</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Marcus Nispel 's Pathfinder is a stark, stylized glimpse far into the past, with the story straying from a straightforward, fact based approach and venturing on a dark, primal voyage of near supernatural viking warriors. Way before North America was colonized by Europeans, fearsome Nordic warriors showed up and laid waste to the land, pillaging and destroying the homes of the Natives. On one of these excursions, they leave one of their own behind, a young child who grows up with the Natives as one of their own, and is given the name 'Ghost'. He grows up to to be a warrior, and when the Vikings return to finish what they started years before, he turns against his own kind to protect the villagers who are now his family, and begins a personal war of vicious carnage and furious retribution on them. Karl Urban plays him with the virile intensity and unmistakable frown he has become known for, and is almost like a force of nature, hiding amongst the lush, dampened foliage, a dormant piece of the terrain until his enemy stalks past, and he is galvanized into action, hacking and slashing his way through an army of spectral marauders like a juggernaut. Russell Means (RIP:() plays the chieftain of the settlement with his usual gravitas, and stunning Moon Bloodgood makes an impression as well. Urban's sleek, dog like heroics go head to head with the brutish, blunt force trauma dealt out by Gunnar, the chief of the Viking army. He is a growling monster played by an unrecognizable Clancy Brown, adorned with a flowing beard and a demonic, nightmarish helmet. Brown played the evil Kurgan in the classic Highlander, and there are shades of that character here, a relentless pursuer without mercy or reason. Much of the film happened at a frenzied pace, leaving you to catch up on the action which comes at a frenzied pace, and is shot in dark, cold colors that give it a striking comic book style edge. Critics slammed this one out of the gate; don't listen to an idiotic word they say. This is one icy blast of sword and snow violence with breathtaking cinematography, refreshingly inventive violence and a dialogue lite/atmosphere heavy vibe of primal mystery and savage deeds amidst the snowy forests of a land yet undiscovered.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Poor Attempt at storytelling</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>From the start, Pathfinder was Bad. The direction was weak. Nispel clearly doesn't have the chops to do action. Which should say something since it requires the least experience to break into films. Nispel's other films were "Frankenstein", "Texas Chainsaw Massacre", and the re-imaging of "Friday the 13th". All horror films. Pathfinder hopefully will be his first and last attempt at making action films this bad. Like I've criticized Mark Steven Johnson for is the same as Nispel for printing the first and probably the only takes. The actors are of the amateur caliber under Nispel's direction with over/under doing it. But Pathfinder doesn't try to be anything it isn't. With that said, it doesn't try to make a concerted effort at the whole action theme either. What does salvage the film from being a total waste is Daniel Pearl's lush and rich color palette darkening that gives the film a moody and ominous look and feel. The art direction and production design are also to the film's benefit. The Vikings or Norsemen truly look feral and formidable with the anachronistic and faux pas goat horns and canine riddled helmets. This truly gives them a touch of aesthetics to help sell the idea that the Natives are over-matched.Clearly, Nispel felt that the less we know about either faction, the less sympathy we'd have for either. It seems the Natives were meant, merely fodder for gratuitous (yawn) scenes which are gratuitous for the sake of gratuity and to make you feel contempt for the Vikings. The whole "story" is that the Vikings, for sheer boredom decide to satiate their inexplicable desire to just kill "savages". There isn't any "McGuffin" here to help move the story forward, no exposition for the characters, little if any semblance for the hero, Ghost's dramatic arc where he learns something about himself for personal growth, and a page ripped from the Michael Bay book of film making: Tell the story without cliché'd words. Use action and random explosions as the characters,story, and plot. By the way, Michael Bay was a producer on "Texas Chainsaw Massacre". So if Nispel's learned anything from him, it's how to emulate him. That is NOT a compliment.</fullReview>

Good question!I don't know really . It's took me 3 day to watch it completely.I just could not stand it anymore after 30 minutes .Had to stop and restart later.I guess that tell you a lot.It's an average movie like so many other.Rent it at your own risk.</fullReview>

Dug the Dances with Wolves sort of vibe there... seemed really genuine and not overly stereotypical of the Indians. The vikings were awesome as nearly fantastical creatures, but actually just really "evil" men. But really they didn't overdo the good vs bad thing... it was enough to keep you rooting for the good guys, but it wasn't an Avatar-like pound a hammer over your head type of message.Just watch it if you like fantasy or action movies.

		<shortDescription>Politically Correct Nonsense</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is probably one of the greatest disappointments ever filmed.In an attempt to placate people constantly offended (like the always offended star Russell Means), a potentially excellent action movie was ruined by political correctness.In Pathfinder the white European Vikings are portrayed as subhuman monsters that kill anything they come across, even when it would be advantageous to leave well enough alone, while the natives are portrayed as peaceful, intelligent hippies that don't know the first thing about fighting and live a communal lifestyle that would make the denizens of Haight-Ashbury proud.The truth is that primitive man (all of them) were rather brutal to one another. The North Americans were no exception. In Pre-Columbian America the native people waged savage battles for survival, there was genocide, some cannibalism even. There were warring tribes and truces and treaties, some were even broken. They were just like primitives the world over. Apocalypto was closer to the truth.It would have been more interesting to see the crazed Viking hoards battling real Indian warriors instead of the wimpy, neutered characters of Pathfinder of which Karl Urban miraculously (some would say magically) seems to be the only one that knows how to fight back.Maybe it's because white people are naturally brutish monsters, huh?</fullReview>

		<fullReview>While the story is good, the flaws begin to stand out.Yes, all the little things that should have been important to the filmmakers in production and in filming.Like - airplanes in the sky.It seems to be winter or early spring but snow doesn't stick to anything, nobody's face or skin turns overly cold or white or purple due to it. Snow doesn't turn to water when collecting on anybodies's face, the pelts they wear do not freeze after they fall through ice into the river Natives have very straight, clean teeth and very clean hair and skin - even after going through battle.Vikings wear heavy amour but move swift, fast and easily through the forest.Climbing the edge of a mountain, nobody is freezing wearing virtually no clothing.There are tire tracks in the mud.Even though a slew of swords are used and arrows are shot, no horses get injured.There are a bunch of things like that - after watching the movie, just begins to make you wonder how this can be thought out and actually given an OK.Snow that blows all over the place, but in some areas of open space, there is none and then several feet away there is several feet of it.Caves with light coming in from all directions.Swords that seem to weigh as much as a can of pop - being easily flung across a field or lifted and swung without much force or effort.I can go on,but I won't.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Could have been magnificent, but still a dark and fascinating movie worth watching</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wasn't expecting much when I started watching this, but that quickly changed thanks to the brilliantly lit scenes and grainy, pensive mood of filming. The acting, as well as the violence was well above average in quality and brutality respectively, and the story was refreshingly original.I believe three things could have elevated this movie to brilliance: 1. A more sweeping, bold orchestral soundtrack. 2. More sweeping, cinematic shots to give us short escapes from what, at times, became a claustrophobic atmosphere. 3. Authentic native language with subtitles, as was given the Vikings. I realize the choice not to do so (point #3) was probably based on perceived audience appeal, or perhaps even on the psychological identification with the "good guys", but it would still have added an element of greatness.Overall I give Pathfinder 8 out of 10 stars for originality, brooding (amazingly refreshing) filming, and an authentic truthfulness in telling what was a simple but bloody tale of revenge. I also appreciated the fact that the film took itself seriously, and did not toss in a heap of "humorous" moments that so many current action movies seem to rely on. This movie was relentless in its pursuit of telling a dark and bloody tale and, for the most part, succeeded in providing an excellent couple hours of escape.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Very Great Film by the Excellent Director Marcus Nispel!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie was gorgeous and everything I ever wanted in a "Viking" lands on North America film. I thought this film was very underrated and with the Judd Apatow dreck that gets called film-making these days this really stands up in beauty and depth of story. The cinematography of the Northwest coast was amazing and incorporating the dense forests and lush environments into the shooting process was simply amazing.The acting was perfect and at times understated in wonderfully blocked scenes between the characters. I thought the action is unmatched by many films pretending to be the action blockbusters they are often sold as. I often marveled at the length in which the filmmakers brought the setting to us no matter how difficult the set-ups seemed.I hope he keeps making films for years to come! Beautiful!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this movie to me when i heard the plot from a friend sounded horrible. Then i sat down to watch it for myself. I loved the Visuals and Story, even though there was not a lot of talking, not all movies need to have loads of talking in it, and The plot is a little overused - the person coming to realize his own people are not good. To be honest that I'm pretty sure if you think about it, It happened a lot in history! So i do not mind the story one bit, i came to enjoy the romance of the movie as well. I have read a lot of reviews and they seem very Contradicting of this movie, a lot have said how bad this movie is with giving the exact same answer as the last guy right before him, "This movie is a copy of so many others" stop and think that ummm lets see, your writing the same review as everyone else with the same plagiarism. This movie Has Suspense, Action, Romance, and everything you could want in a good time viewing. I highly recommend this movie, Its definitely an acquired taste of movie delight (this is my opinion hehe) Definitely worth a rent, because i know eventually this will be a cult loving classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Terrible, terrible, terrible!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I wanted to see this movie because of the theme (or rather what I imagined the theme would be): settlers from Scandinavia arrive to North America and come into conflict with the local population. However the movie completely lacks a build-up of the conflict. Instead the vikings are simply a big group of guys (and only guys, although someone might think that if people go on a sailing trip to settle in a different continent, you would think they would bring women as well), who are all dressed up like some crappy Finnish hard rock band. The real vikings never had horned helmets. In the movie whenever a viking is in battle, he makes a "HUUURGGHHHHH!"-noise every time he takes an extremely clumsy step or slashes with his sword.All the battle scenes are terribly bad. The physics and dynamics are way unrealistic (and not in a good way), in particular the way blood "splashes out" wherever someone gets injured. Oh yeah, cutting out an eye with a sword slash... I'd love to see the mechanics behind explained...I would have thought the special effects were from a time well back in the last century, but no! The movie is from 2007 and the budget was 31 million dollars. That money was certainly not spent on special effects.The story has several logical weaknesses. Given that the vikings did fall for the trap of walking on the ice, why would they not punish Ghost and Starfire for the set-up? They could have cut-off Starfires hand or whatever, but kept her alive so Ghost would still cooperate. It just doesn't make sense that they get tricked and that in the commotion Ghost and Starfire are fighting against the vikings, but afterwards the vikings just continue as if nothing happened.While some claim the vikings were primarily tradesmen, some will say that they were brutish and big fans of looting, plunder and rape. Given the later idea, what were the vikings in Pathfinder profiting from in North America? There is hardly nothing to loot or plunder. British, French and German monasteries would have had gold and silver, whereas Indians have... fur? As the Pathfinder vikings kill everyone, rounding up slaves is not the rationale for their expedition.In conclusion the movie doesn't even try to make the story coherent and logical. The most interesting thing that could have been done would have been a clash-of-civilizations theme, picturing two cultures driven to conflict by competition for food, territory and natural resources.However, I do not regret watching this movie, as it taught me many things about what makes a movie really, really bad.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Why this movie depicts WHITE vikings assaulting poor little Indians is unknown. Possibly just another ANTI-WHITE movie. The story is actually from the Saami folklore. The Saami are indigenous people of Scandinavia and it is about another tribe called the Tjudes. The Tjudes attacked the Saami and killed all but one boy. They used this boy to help them find the next Saami tribe. But instead he led them up a mountain and had themselves tied to one another so that they would not fall. It was dark and he threw his torch over the side and told them to follow him and they plummeted to their death. Both the Saami and the Tjudes are WHITE! Why does Hollywood always have to make movies based on their liberal ideology which always makes WHITE people out to be devils? This movie is horrible not for what it is but for what it is not!</fullReview>

However, in the case of Pathfinder I simply cannot.I have now attempted to watch this twice, the second time assisted by a bottle or two of wine and still have been unable to make it past 40 minutes. The story is terrible, the acting poor and the "Vikings"?!?!? They look more like something out of Mad Max or Chronicles of Riddick.The CGI effects, especially during fight scenes, are extremely poor - a sword clearly touching someones back provides us with a massive splash of CGI blood that is just unrealistic.

Props to the cinematographer. But the dialog was cringeworthy. The Vikings were unrecognizable. Don't get me wrong; that side of the family was a rapacious bunch. But they didn't "purify" lands. Simple pragmatism: there wouldn't be anyone to raid. I was amused by the Native Americans speaking English and the Vikings speaking . .. Icelandic? something that sounded like Old English. Good times. That said, the dialog needed a final hard edit. I'm wondering if Russell Means had some sort of dialog approval, because all his stuff was just fine. Some quality violence. It was fine. I'm a girl who loved Doom, so it's not like my standards are all that high, at least if Karl Urban's in the film, but . . . man.

		<fullReview>Pathfinder was pretty good for an action film. It had lots of battles, limbs being severed, someone even gets drawn and quartered. Very gruesome. The Vikings are sadistic and love to torture the Indians. The main character, Ghost, was pretty cool. He was adopted by the natives when left behind as a young boy by the Vikings. When the Vikings come back to attack when Ghost is much older, he is now the hero. He manages to handle many vikings and kill them all. He also has the girl he likes and another Indian tagging alone. He eventually gets caught and must take care of the vikings before they kill the rest of the tribe.One weird thing was the Indians speak perfect Engligh, while the Vikings are subtitle. And Ghost remembers how to speak viking, amazing.The film is filtered to take out a lot of the light. Therefore, we don't have graphic gore since the blood almost looks black. But it gives the film a neat effect. It helps hide the low budget the film had.FINAL VERDICT: OK, certainly not one of the worst action films out there.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Beautiful cinematography, good concepts, action?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Practically the only element of this movie I really enjoyed was its cinematography. The movie is not in black and white - but it is these two colors - bright and dark, pure and corrupt, good and evil - that the makers have decided appropriate for the film. There are some beautiful shots of landscape and cliffs, portraying a feral mountains range around the time of the Vikings setting foot in America.I felt that "The Quiet One" was a most necessarily character - unfortunately, like most of the native Americans he was viciously slain. There was also a concept in the movie about a bear and its strength. How to use that strength against the creature and thus defeat it. A wonderful idea, but I felt it could have been stronger if it happened before the landing of the second company of Viking - before the massacre of Ghost's village, before the running away.Like the Bear scene, there is a lot of action in the film that just seems to be thrown in at places, making the film overall very jumpy and actually causing my attention to wander a bit. Most of the characters are flat, the relationship between Ghost and Moon could have and should have been developed more - even in an action movie, this element is necessary. In place of some of the film's misplaced action, there needs to be character development. And development not necessary through dialogue. More interaction with the characters finding little 'warmths' in the cold - quirks and affectionate gestures.I'd give this movie a 6 - for misplaced concepts in a beautiful world.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Apocalypse North, er, I mean Apocalypto North</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Viking boy gone native has acquired superhuman combat skills and can somehow overcome Viking etc. etc. Its a combination of Apocalypto, Dances with Wolves (gone native), Connan the Barbarian, The Last of the Mohecans, Lort of the Rings, etc.. There are so many spoofs on other movies, I'd think it was written by Leslie Nielson, er., except for the swords, and the killing, the skulls, the ships, and the lack of jokes.Some problems.Setting. Beautiful scenery, but its all wrong. Somehow I guess the Viking boats gained wings and flew across the continent in order to reach the West coast. Or do they have avalanches in Newfoundland? Do the film makers really think Newfoundland has snow-covered mountains? Newfoundland has beautiful, awe-inspiring scenery, so why film it on the West Coast.Historical inaccuracies and negative stereotypes: Vikings were not sea borne serial killers, they were traders and businessmen first and foremost. In England they ran a protection racket -- "nice town, shame if it were to catch fire all of a sudden, pay us gold and we'll make sure it doesn't catch fire accidentally and if you pay us enough, will go away for a bit, ja." The negative stereotypes of them as shown in the film have a lot to do with the fact that Christians (who stared the wars with the Vikings) wrote the histories. Why must movies depict vikings as such bloodthirsty villains. This is the same problem I have with 300 -- why exaggerate the enemy to make them so one dimensionally evil. A worthy opponent would make the film so much more interesting.Story: The story would be OK I suppose if it was treated with a bit more balance, but the enemy is shown to be mindlessly nasty with no purpose. Why would the Viking travel half way around the world, just for the fun of killing, there are perfectly good places back in Europe if all you want to do is have some mindless killing -- the west Coast of England for example is still un-"protected". The writing was incredibly lazy, very little originality. My kids and I had some fun picking out all scenes that were stolen from other movies. Mostly Apocalypto, but many many other films were also spoofed. Falling through the ice was stolen from a fairly recent and rather inept version of King Arthur (saxons falling through the ice). For those interested, the real historical ice trick occurred in Russia, where a group of Russians retreated over a lake, a Teutonic heavy calvary followed, and disappeared under the ice.Combat. OK, iron is really really sharp, but as soon as you get into dense forest, the balance swings in favor of the stealth warrior. Natives were known as extremely good stealth warriors. Horses cannot travel through dense woods so forget the horses. A native, or even a viking dressed as a native in deerskins would have had no difficulty escaping a gang of metal clad Vikings. But how could he possibly have learned to fight better than the vikings who have apparently (according to their movie) spent their lives killing! At least in Conan, the origin of his strength is explained in the film, but this viking Conan gone native apparently just taught himself how to fight.I can understand why spears and arrows might have been stopped by chain-mail, but natives also fought with clubs which they used very effectively. Historically, natives in the Americas were easily conquered only where they lived in cities (Mexico, Peru). In, the woods of North America or the Amazon jungle European technology had great difficulty overcoming native stealth.Watch towers. As with Apocalypto, the native village is depicted as defenseless. That makes no sense. Natives were warriors and hunters living in the wilderness who often engaged in warfare with the neighbors. They prided themselves on being able to hear an enemy coming from miles away. In Apocalypto the hunters hear the approach of a vanquished tribe, but allow an enemy to enter their village while they sleep! Ridiculous. In this film, how could metal clad warriors with horses possibly sneak up on a native village.Overall, some good fighting if you don't mind the ridiculous story.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Vikings vs Indians (native Americans) - how cool is that? Not very, as it turns out.See, first you need a story. Then you need a decent script. This notion seems to have passed by the producers of Pathfinder, who apparently operate on the basis that as long as you have loads of crashingly violent action, all will be well. Well, it won't.The story is woefully thin.The script is hopeless.The story, such as it is, is confusingly told (no mean feat for such a simple narrative).Characterisation is non-existent.An attempt has been made at generating moody atmospheric visuals. Unfortunately, this turns out to mean muddy and indistinct, with everything happening in darkness.The action scenes are well done subject only to the fact that they go on for ever and are extremely violent. In fact, one gets the impression that this film exists solely in order to be a vehicle for the violent fighting. 300 did this better (just as much solo-mo, though).A poor effort and a blot on Karl Urban's and Clancy Brown's CVs.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Brutal and violent</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Recap: A sole surviving Viking boy is left behind on an expedition to North America. Taken in by the native people he is brought up as a friend, but not as a member of the People. The memory of the savage Vikings is too strong. But one day the man is the last line of defense when the Vikings return.Comments: Actually quite true to the original Veivisaren (Ofelas) with two exceptions. Even if Veivisaren was known to be violent (in it s time and for a Scandinavian movie) this is far more violent. Actually it is quite brutal and doesn't shy away from much. It kind of makes a point of showing as much as possible, even a little more than is needed. The other exception is the background story as it is completely rewritten, mostly due to the change in location to the northern North America. Why the hero must be an orphan Viking boy and not one of the native people I can't really see a reason for, except that the studio thinks it is easier for the largest part of the audience to identify with a white man.But the movie is quite good. It promises action, and delivers action. It never intends to give anything else, and it is unfair to expect more of it. There are some thin sub-stories, for example a weak love story, but you see this for the action.Sit back and enjoy the swords and axes fly.7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Uninspired throw-back to the bad old days of stereotyping and demonization, except the people being demonized in this worthless film are Europeans.Young Viking lad is left alone and scared on the shores of N. America and is adopted by the natives. Almost before the opening credits have finished, we learn that the natives are noble and the Vikings are savages. In fact, the Vikings do not even have faces. Even in the rare instances when they take off their bizarre helmets, you cannot see their faces through their beards and their encrusted filth. The natives, of course, have kind, open, beardless faces that radiate warmth and understanding.Years later, the boy is all grown up, just in time to fight another gang of Vikings, who appear to want nothing but to butcher the natives. The end.Plot: not much. Character development: forget it. Music: can't recall. Direction: pointless. Action: dull (yes, there is a lot of blood and gore, but somehow you just don't care).Blooper: early on, Ghost explains to his tribe that the invaders wear a kind of skin that cannot be pierced by stone arrows (i.e., armor), but for the rest of the movie we watch natives killing Vikings with---stone arrows.Really, if you want to see some great historical fiction about the Americas, forget this tripe and try: "Black Robe" and "Apocalypto" (I know there are some others, but I can't think of them right now). In fact, you might want to compare movies to see how great the others are and how awful this one is.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I had been told that this movie was bad, but still I was unprepared for this incredible stupidity. There is not a single redeeming feature ? or a single detail reminding me of my ancestors in this movie. Allow me to expand on that. Let me begin with the obvious. By now most people already know that the vikings didn't have horned helmets. Nor did they have spikes or wings on their helmets, or their ships! They used simple yet ingenious helmets of hammered iron or steel, sometimes with a nose-guard attached. They were used to fighting in close formations, so any unnecessary protrusions in armor would be avoided. They often fought much like the romans in close ranks with shields up front. From behind these shield-walls, they wielded long-shafted axes.The vikings used plain leather and chain mail armor. If they ever used pieces of plate armor, it would have been salvaged from a battleground after a fight, like the plate armor used by the viking leader in the 13 Warrior.The vikings never had the word «viking» in their vocabulary. It is a relatively modern term. The vikings who sailed to America were Christians with no intent for slaughter or pillage. They were traders and settlers. The viking era was behind them, ending in around 1030.If you get the chance, see the original Pathfinder movie Ofelas, made around where I grew up. It is a lot better.Not much else to say. There are no vikings in this movie, and no story. «They came, they slaughtered, they ?» well, no spoilers here, but you get the idea. Bad dialogue, no direction, badly cut, horrible pacing, and the movie is too long considering the content. Would have been great as a power metal video on TV though.</fullReview>

A movie like this need no love scenes. And to take a little pretty girl, and have her kill hard core vikings is just wrong. Further the lead character kills so many so easily, even though he has only held a sword when he was five years old.. and yes, he didn't use it then either. Oh, and he can ride a horse, even though he has never ridden on one, because guess what. they didn't have them at that time. Okay, i know it is a fantasy movie, but three guys killing tree ships of barbaric Hard Core VIKINGS, thats a ship each. And the end..

This is not a Viking VS Indians movie, This Is Indians VS brainless Zombies. I was so disappointed over this movie, i signed up here just to tell people not to watch it.

		<fullReview>I had a lot of negative expectations about this "White man come to save the poor Indians" movie going into it, but there were quite a few things in it that surprised me. While I won't be telling my friends that this is a must-see movie, I don't feel like I wasted my money.The movie is based on a legend (which in themselves aren't known for historical accuracy) so there was no need to expect the History Channel version of the tale. The beginning was pretty much as I expected (Viking boy rescued by Indian woman, comes to be part of Indian people) and I thought the violence would be never-ending. Once more dialogue developed between the remaining characters and things sort of "calmed down", the story turned into a real survival tale that grabs and holds your attention, even if it's not Academy Award material.The thing I really hated about some of the fight scenes in the beginning were that they were filmed in a way that you could not really see or understand some of the things that had just occurred. You know somebody got killed or sliced really bad, but it was hard to tell where or sometimes how. Some of the shots were so close to their subjects, they were a blur. The acting didn't strike me as being cheesy. I thought most of the performances were OK and Karl Urban made you feel for his character.Overall, it's not the best action flick out there, but there things in the plot that aren't totally predictable which makes pretty decent.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Before f***ing my heritage. The film starts out with a message to the viewer that reads something like "600 years before Columbus Vikings tried to conquer the new world." Well, that's close to what happened, but not quite on the money. See.. A few viking (AKA homesteaders) ships left Greenland to set up camp in Nova Scotia because the Vikings were in search of better lands.. Some hostile Indians killed one of the Vikings and so they went back to Greenland. Maybe this isn't the most exciting story to tell, so I can deal with some embellishment. But hold on now.Vikings that wear 50 pound horned helmets to look menacing. Vikings who speak bad Icelandic (I've only been studying it for a couple years and I could tell). Vikings who care not for plunder, but instead to simply destroy all that is beautiful in the world.I just want the reader to imagine a role reversal. Crazy savages bent on destruction invade a Viking encampment just to see what the blood of white skinned children tastes like. They dress in wolf skins, don't bathe, and laugh at any resistance while kicking over baskets of berries and burning everything in sight. You won't ever see this in a film made after 1940. Why? Not because it isn't entertaining, but because liberal Hollywood knows very well who it is PC to dress up as the villains. They know that sympathies for native Americans run deep because on some level Americans feel guilty about how they WERE raped and plundered by Columbus and his progeny of goons.Now is about when you are going.. Man.. You're taking this way too seriously. Look at it for it's entertainment value.First of all, people with this attitude disgust me. These are the types that think entertainment is more important than history. You are exactly the kind of person who is willing to be duped by Fox News propaganda and the country would probably be better off without you.But... Needless to say I did try to be entertained. The sled chase scene ala Willow was pretty cool, but it's hard to enjoy a film where all of its redeeming qualities were plagiarized. See:Pathfinder (the first one), Willow, Predator, Last of the Mohicans. etc.To sum things up this film was a cut and paste version of several other films. The acting was the worst. The editing was a close second. The plot made no logical sense and was something I would even call racist in the 300 sense of the word. Don't even rent it if you value the fruits of your labor.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Comments on the movie "Pathfinder"</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just saw the new movie "Pathfinder" and read some of the other reviews written on it. It seems that most people don't realize that this story is based on a Norse legend that is over 1,000 years old. I believe that this is why it was filmed almost like a dream and did not contain a lot of character development. It is a brutal story that pits good against evil and so the Vikings are portrayed as huge monsters and the Native people are shown as simple and kind people. If you want to see another interpretation of this same legend, you might want to obtain a copy of the movie by the same name, that was filmed in Norway in 1988. The dialog is in the Saami language with subtitles. It was nominated for an Academy Award for best Foreign Film and is much different than this recent one. However, they both have their place in telling the story. One is not better than the other, just different. Those who went to see this most recent film, should have done some reading about the history of the story before they went. Then they might not have been so disappointed. This movie was not intended to be your usual gory action movie. It has a larger purpose in telling this story. However, it is not a movie with a wide appeal. I am part Saami and so I went to see it because of that fact. I cannot say that I "enjoyed" it but it was very interesting.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Loved this movie!!!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Sure Pathfinder is dumb in places. I don't have any spoilers but pointing out some things to look for. The movie seems to have borrowed most of it's story from other movies. It's quite a bit like Dances with Wolves, with a bit of Rambo thrown in. It seems to borrow the ice scene from King Arthur. The sledding scene that everyone thinks is so funny goes on and on. Some people have asked where he learned to use his sword but the movie shows him practicing with it. Besides, we see no fancy swordplay in this movie, it's just hacking and slashing for all your worth. Of course, this is a formula picture in which one person takes on an army by himself basically but there are a few surprises thrown in and some failures that you might not expect from a heroic fantasy. I really liked this movie in spite of its goofiness. My wife absolutely hated it and wouldn't quit squirming in her seat. It's not a chick flick by any stretch of the imagination. Why did I give it a 10 then? Because artistically it's in a class all by itself. Never have the villains looked cooler or crueler than in this movie. Though Conan and 300 are tons better than this movie, no other movie I've ever seen has better looking villains. This look like Vikings from your worst nightmare. Both beautiful, demonic and seemingly invincible. Also their armored horses look absolutely stunning. This is Frazetta brought to life. You just have to see it to believe it. They look great throughout but be forewarned, you've seen the story before, many times, in many films. Silly but artistically wonderful and I just loved it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know why so many people is saying this movie sucks because it is not history accurate. Hey it is just a movie. Can't you sit back and enjoy the movie and stop you complaining about all the history inaccurate thing? Anyway, Pathfinder is about a boy who was left behind by his clan because he somehow doesn't fit in the clan. Later, he was found by a girl who took him into her clan. They took him in and called him Ghost. Years pass and he is raised by the clan. Everything seems so well until one day, Ghost's old clan came back. They came, they kill and Ghost wants revenge. Then they fight and fight and fight.What I like most about this movie is the costume. After watching the movie, I want a toy company to create the Vikings. The armors are nice. I like the way they shoot the movie. Pretty cool. The script is somehow OK. It is good but not that good.A cool movie. Worth watching if you are into swords and armors movies. Fans of Apocalypto and Conan will enjoy this. And stop listen to all this history inaccurate crap.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>highly underrated</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>brutally torn apart by the official critics, Pathfinder is both my favorite Karl Urban performance and a classic story of the outsider finding his place and his identity in this world through courage and companionship. Anyone who can't identify with this plot has been through too little trouble in this world and little self-searching. It may be true that there is little originality, but has it not also been said there there are no truly new stories to be told in this world? and that was said many centuries ago. not the best film to be made in modern times, but far, far from the worst and there are more highly rated films and TV that are vastly worst.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Bart the Bear was not using authentic Brown Bear Dialect of the time period which was highly offensive to the Grizzly community. An outrage. And I believe that one of the Native American actors was named Stephen which is not an authentic American Indian denomination. A travesty. I also noticed that Karl Urban was in the movie and he definitely wasn't around during the time period that was clearly defined by the film makers during the opening scene. Very misleading. Also the stereotypical battle cries of the Native Americans were hauntingly similar to that of Ewoks on the Forest Moon of Endor which was very unsettling for most viewers. Furthermore at certain points during the film the American Indians were speaking English, completely contaminating the otherwise 100% historically accurate portrayal of the famous Viking/Indian war. But overall it was an enjoyable picture!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>dark bloody uncompelling story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A Viking boy is discovered by Native Americans after his longboat is shipwrecked. He is adopted into the tribe after the Viking marauders are massacred. He is given the name Ghost (Karl Urban) and grows up using his Viking father's sword. He falls in love Starfire (Moon Bloodgood) who is the daughter of a friendly tribe chieftain Pathfinder (Russell Means). Then his tribe is attacked by new Viking raiders led by Gunnar (Clancy Brown).This is Conan the Barbarian in Native North America. It's dark, brutal and messy. I can see where the graphic novel is coming from but the translation to the screen is not compelling. I do like the crazy Viking style and the bloody gore which I'm guessing comes from the comics. The dark brooding mood and music do wear thin. Director Marcus Nispel, who is more known for his music video work, does badly with the narrative. It's not compelling. Karl Urban is a great actor but overall the acting from everyone is poor. This is a dark bloody mess from an intriguing graphic novel idea.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Muddled and lacking in focus</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The biggest problem with Pathfinder is that it's style over substance. It feels less like a movie and more like an hour and a half long heavy metal music video. And on some level that's awesome. It has native Americans fighting demonic vikings, on majestic mountains, in the middle of a raging winter storm. As I said, heavy metal.But, even though I know I have to turn in my male membership card for saying this, it needs more. It needs to have characters that have actual, well, character. It needs to have dialogue. Because there actually is very little of that in here, it's mostly just wordless action. As I said, music video. It needs to have a plot beyond basic good guy kills bad guys. There really are no actors, only stunt men. The location is unrealistic, the vikings laughably over the top, it suffers from the oh so enraging "in the end it takes a white guy to solve the problem, even when the problem is the white guys" syndrome and it's about the definition of brainless.Then again, did I mention the demonic vikings. Because they're cool, they're really cool. I cannot deny that a significant part of me went "Oh yeah!" more often than not while watching this film. And sure, the visuals are needlessly dark and muddled, but the action itself is pretty cool to watch, the designs got a lot of things right and there is some "so bad it's good" value to this. It's dumb, but if you've ever wondered what it would be like if your favourite heavy metal music video was longer and had something resembling a plot, this might be worth a watch. Pop in some Amon Amarth, turn down the volume of your TV and enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pretty Awful action film with little feel to it</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pathfinder is an action film that although has some well choreographed fight scenes, never does much better than that, and also the only reason I didn't rate it lower. With poor acting to contribute to the already negative sounding movie, you can't help feel whilst watching "who ever thought this or that was a good idea". At least it was a short movie, probably one more reason it isn't nauseatingly bad, I felt it was just about a bad movie, and here below is why so.The story is one that isn't always seen, but nevertheless is still played out very badly and never gets to the point I feel it wanted to reach. I did enjoy(slightly) some of the action scenes scattered around, mostly in the middle it has to be said, and they can actually make you want to keep looking at the screen. It could have been better if it had put in more action, it may sound like a terrible formula but even over the top fighting would probably have saved this movie just a little bit.Karl Urban is not the worst actor, and been in some blockbusters before, but here he seems out of place and very still like, almost as if they cast George of the jungle to be the main character. Russell Means as the Pathfinder is really quite good and is probably the only actor in this that puts in a serious display, sadly he is wasted in most of his scenes. Any chemistry the makers wanted never comes to fruition either, even when people are angry at one another they still seem to be good friends for some strange reason.The directing is pretty bad but not the worst thing seen here, some scenes at the end and of course any action is well done and so the director isn't all at fault. The writing is bad to say the least, just not one piece of dialogue seems to be any thing other than basic, the thing is some parts are set up quite well just to be wasted by the script involved. Special Effects are unneeded but used, instead of building sets which are pretty simple they decided to digitally do certain things, which make the film look very cheap but also ruin what could have been decent parts.I said before about the action, not too bad and well done in most parts when not ruined by effects or acting. One thing that is well done are the grim scenes, any part which is meant to be a dark and horrible bit is actually done quite well and you can at time feel genuinely bad for the people on the wrong end of the scenes. Other than those points and Russell Means acting, not much more positivity to give I'm afraid.If you want to see an action filled film, and don't care about the script, directing and acting, then this could be for you for sure. If you also like blood and guts, I guess partly this could be for you too, not so much guts but very bloody when in fighting. If you want to see a well worked drama piece then stay away, this is possibly a great definition of bad drama, working with over used fighting.Overall it is just about a Pretty Terrible movie and one that so nearly is just "Bad". As said It isn't long and so it means you aren't too annoyed you wasted your time viewing it by the end, although you may have a few choice words by the time it is finished. I must stress there are worse movies out there so don't think this will make you puke in disgust, well maybe you will a little.</fullReview>

Absolutely no redeeming features to this movie. The acting is horrendous, the 'vikings' are caricatures as are the native Americans. With no plot it is really hard to have character and story progression.

		<shortDescription>* So Disappointing *</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was incredibly disappointed in this film.I watched this expecting it to be a smart, historically-based film about what might have happened if the Vikings -- who we know settled in Newfoundland and New England for a time -- had left behind a boy to be raised by Native Americans. Would he be found years later by later Viking expeditions? Would he fit into Native American culture? What later conflicts might ensue? Or might he serve as a bridge between two cultures?Instead, the movie is a crazy mish-mash of over-the-top sword-based gore, and little else. The "Vikings" look NOTHING LIKE any actual Vikings at all, with costumes, gear, and helmets that are more inspired by Frank Frazetta fantasy paintings from the 70s and 80s than any actual Norse history. Their evil, ferocious behavior in the film is completely fabricated as well. These are just about the most UN-Viking people one could imagine. Moreover, their longboats are about three times larger than any actual Viking longboat found to date...just non-sensical. Even the Native American villages seemed to depart from known facts about them as well.The combat scenes were over-the-top, repetitive, and non-sensical as well, with little self-consistency or grounding in reality.I'm disappointed in Karl Urban for agreeing to act in this film and wonder if he ever read the screenplay before taking the role.I sincerely HOPE someone makes a decent movie about what might have been based on a bit more real-world facts about the known Viking settlements in North America. If anyone is interested in a SMART, dramatic, historically accurate, well-produced series about the Norse who conducted raids on England (i.e., went "viking"...it's a verb, not a noun, in truth), I strongly recommend History Channel's dramatic fictional series "Vikings." Even the acting kicks butt, with Gabriel Byrne playing a key role in most of the first season. The cinematography is breathtaking...especially in the second half of the first season. Moreover, the textured, nuanced portrayal of the peculiarities of the REAL-WORLD Norse culture of centuries ago are fascinating and, at times, shocking.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Ought to be terrible, but actually good fun</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pathfinder ought to be a terrible film. It's about as historically accurate as Braveheart and completely unoriginal, being essentially a remake of the (very good) Norwegian film of the same name, with bits of First Blood, Kato's Land and Fuqua's King Arthur thrown in. But if you can stop yourself going "Dude, Vikings didn't have cavalry!"* and suchlike, you can enjoy it as a straightforward action/fantasy film. It's the usual story of the bad guys who burn the village and the hero who stops them, which means it has funky barbarian costumes, cool weapons** and traps, spectacular landscapes and of course lots of fight scenes, and the fight scenes are done really well. As a bonus, it's beautifully filmed.* OK, Vikings did sometimes use horses as transport, but they didn't take them on their ships; they stole them when they arrived, and in America there would have been no horses to steal. ** Including one-handed flails, which didn't appear until the late Middle Ages.</fullReview>

All pretty realistic except the volume of blood spraying was a bit much. All in keeping with the film-makers decision to use horny helmets on the Vikings in spite of known to be inaccurate. Ten minutes were spent cliff-hanging by a rope, with the rope refusing to fail until it finally had to be cut with a knife/sword. This was the darkest film I have seen since "The 300" - apparently a feature required when setting graphic novels/comics for the big screen.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Incredibly good-looking action/adventure flick</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Released in 2007, "Pathfinder" relays the story of Vikings coming to North America hundreds of years before Columbus and bringing death &amp; destruction to the Native Americans. One of the natives, Ghost (Karl Urban) is actually a Viking by blood, a survivor of the previous Viking expedition, brought up by the Indians. Understandably, Ghost denies his Viking heritage and fights for the natives.I thought this was going to be some low-budget Syfy flick but, no, "Pathfinder" was a theatrical release with stellar production values. The first thing I noticed was that the director was Marcus Nispel, who went on to direct the 2011 version of "Conan the Barbarian." As others have noted, there are some derivative bits sprinkled throughout, e.g. "Conan the Barbarian," "Rambo 2," "Last of the Mohicans," etc., but it's unique enough to embrace and enjoy.The villains are the Vikings, who are depicted as cartooney inhuman monsters, whereas the natives are virtuous. This brings up the whole nature vs. nurture issue as Ghost is of Viking heritage but because he's brought up by the spiritual natives he isn't corrupted by the Vikings' ways. This suggests that evil or immorality is socially spread.Russell Means, who played Chingachgook in "Last of the Mohicans," is on hand as the elder Pathfinder. It's great to see him still truckin' along at almost seventy years old.The film was shot in British Columbia in mostly forest settings, but with occasional mountains that don't look anything like the Northeast. Despite this flaw, "Pathfinder" is a visually striking film from beginning to end, and I don't just mean the scenery. Nispel knows how to make a spectacularly good-looking film, that's for sure. In fact, it's so awe-inspiring it's worth the price of admission.Unfortunately, I can't say the same for the story. Everything's there for a quality story, but somehow it's just not all that captivating like "Last of the Mohicans" or the original "Conan the Barbarian," although it's not bad, and it's certainly better than "Rambo 2." Some complain about the extreme violence but it's definitely not a case of violence for the sake of violence as there are a lot of dramatic valleys to contrast the violent highs. Depth is hinted at, many times, I just wish there was more.GRADE: B</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Well, I began watching this movie because hey, it sounded like fun. And it was. There was some great "13th Warrior" style action, complete with all the gore you would expect from a movie involving Vikings. I was happy to see First Nations Peoples fighting back - maybe it wasn't quite the movie I'd like to see (Custer's Last Stand, or any other battle where white conquerors got their comeuppance), but hey, at least they were fighting back.The art direction was great for a movie that clearly didn't the huge budget of most blockbusters. And I really liked the reinterpretation of Viking costume - they looked VERY cool.But here's the thing. A little way into the film, I realized that this is yet another film where a group of "noble savages" are only saved by the ingenious plans and warlike skills of someone of European descent. This is just another "Dances With Wolves," "Last of the Mohicans," and even "Little Big Man," (though I liked this film, and I gather it's intelligent portrayal of First Nations Peoples is a step forward, it is still a story about a white man.) Take it from me, and go see "Dance Me Outside," "Reel Injun," or even "Windtalkers" (though not created and produced by First Nations Peoples, but starring the incomparable Adam Beach and telling the story of the essential role played by Navajo Code Talkers in WWII). Those films will change your life.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I have to say this movie was okay in the sense that it WAS different from other action movies.I find things about Vikings really interesting. During the movie you get the idea that these Vikings were almost monsterish and inhuman by the way they act. I liked the way they were portrayed. This movie reminds me a bit of the classic "Beastmaster" in a way, or at least the main character does. It's a little slow to get started in the action, but works up to an average entertaining plot.This movie follows in the path of movies like the recently re-made 10,000 B.C. Pathfinder came out at the same time 10,000 B.C. did, and undoubtedly, lost the battle at the theaters. I picked up Pathfinder for $10 at Wal Mart and I personally enjoyed it. It has a bit of a romantic plot to it at as well, and that always meaningful "life lesson" to be learned in the movie. It's kind of long and as I said, can be quite boring until the last hour of the movie. For $10, I think it's worth the watch but overall I have to give it a 5/10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Vikings VS. Indians</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The beginning of the Pathfinder is extremely promising one and in its style pretty relentless and bloody, at least in the uncut version of the film. In many scenes it reminded me of good old "Conan The Barbarian", which is one of my favourite films.But sadly enough the relentless spirit of the story flattens rather badly in the last half of the film, when Ghost (Karl Urban) is captured by the vikings. The space slows down remarkably and at least my interest level decreased as well, but nothing changes the fact, that the first half is extremely enjoyable in its serious way.The art direction is rather interesting, especially the viking costumes are very well done, not in the terms of how realistic they are, but how effectively orcish they look.Pathifinder isn't trying to re-tell history, its far from that. If you take it as an action fantasy, then you'll be much happier with it than if you think you're gonna see historically accurate portrayal of how vikings went to America and met some Indians.Personally I was surprised by this movie, as I was expecting to see a film in the style of Xena/Hercules or The Scorpion King. So because it wasn't anything like that, I was extremely positively surprised, even though the film wasn't a cinematic masterpiece in its own right. Still, rather enjoyable movie none the less.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie worths to be watched just once, if you are a fan of slasher action movies with lots of sword-fighting and "one-good-guy-against-many-bad-guys" type of thing.The movie had the potential. The plot is simple and predictable, but it's the way this kind of movies should be. The acting is OK, not good, not bad... it just can't be good because of the roles itself, and it's not bad, because actors just couldn't do better from what they had in script... so this is the case, where if characters are not well developed, you have to blame script, not actors.The cast is actually VERY good. Indians really look like Indians and not like their "hollywoodised" prototypes, but if they fit in role perfectly with their apparent, they fell to be natural in the way of their lifestyle and habits. They seem to have well democratised society with women having equal rights with men and with everyone happy and free before bad guys come to their land. Just unbelievable.Good thing about vikings (or maybe bad thing for vikings fans), that they're not idealised warrior heroes, but murderers, rapers and brutal savages as they historically were most of the time, (though I don't have anything against their idealised version too, painting them as just honorable brave warriors, sometimes doing good deeds. And I love their sagas and mythology, so I don't mean to offend if any Scandinavian is reading it, I respect Scandinavian culture)The action scenes are good and bad same time. They are good, because there's obviously some great choreography, stunt effects and sword-fighting scenes, but bad sides of that is, that most of the scenes are happening during night/in dark valleys/in caves/during heavy snow when visibility is poor... So you start to think: "what a hell, they spent so much money, and I feel that the scene behind this darkness on the screen is great, but I can't see it...". Some low budget movies use the "darkness tactics" to cover up their low budget and don't show you that scene is not so good, but this movie didn't have the need in that, as clearly it is not a low budget movie, at least it doesn't look like that.Did you noticed, after almost every "good" of the movie, I used word "but", so these "but-s" are why this movie got only 6 from me, not higher.If only the plot, not so much insulting simple... If only the fight scenes would be more visible... If only the characters would be little more developed... If only... if only all that, this could be one of the best movies of year... but now, just 1-timer, as I stated above</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>To kill a bunch of Vikings efficiently, it's best to convince them to go mountain-climbing.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>More thought went into any given 3-panel Peanuts cartoon than this movie. In spite of the fact that the intro clearly states that this is "a legend", i.e. should be viewed as one reads a comic-book and not as a historical account, the movie has too many flaws - even on that base level. The story is predictable, the Indians are stereotypical hence quite dull, and there are various plot-devices that are a bit on the stupid side. Many clichés.The Indians are noble, and spew fortune-cookie wisdom dime-a-dozen. Sillier still, Urban's girlfriend and her father both seem to be into distributing pacifistic sayings in the most inappropriate times imaginable! The squaw preaches to Urban about love and hate just moments after Urban kills a bunch of Vikings. I mean, killing these Nothern European guys isn't just a matter of revenge, it's a matter of survival for the other Indian tribes, isn't it? Hallo!!!! Yet, after she finishes her very brief speech, she joins in Urban in killing some more Scandinavian blondies! What's that all about?? Similarly, the squaw's Dad, her tribe's chief, preaches later some more to Urban about revenge - with a clear note of pacifism - moments after he himself has bumped off a few Swedes! Was this supposed to comical? How can anyone expect us to believe that the older North American Indians dabbled in pacifism???? Especially in times of extreme crisis such as these. Clearly, the script was written and supported by Hollywood liberals: the kind that would suggest/believe that the best way to fight Bin Laden would be to philosophize about life and destiny.The Indians in this movie have almost nothing to do with real Indians - of any age. Over the decades Hollywood has gone from portraying them as totally vile savages to showing them to be some kind of Gandhi-like bunch of peaceful philosophers. Obviously, neither way of looking at them is accurate/realistic.I really had to laugh at one scene that was supposed to be very tragic. Urban, the clown/mime Indian, and the squaw set up an elaborate trap for the savage Blonde Ones, and then suddenly the squaw's tribesmen appear out of nowhere and fall into the traps! Sorry, but that was very funny. Worthy of a Looney Toones cartoon.One of the silliest scenes was when the BjornBorgs decided to walk over a FROZEN LAKE, instead of going around it. Surely, these men come from lands in which they see frozen lakes all the time hence must know about the dangers of walking on one with horses! Plus, Urban falling into ICE-COLD water for the second time in a short space, with no negative effects on his health. I didn't even hear him sneeze.In the end, how does this much-anticipated grand demise of the Vikings look like? Urban hits one in the head with a rock, and the rest, who are tied to him, just fall off the cliff with him. Naturally, Urban and his girlie survive. So simple, yet so... dumb.Which brings me to the dumbest thing, which I left for last: WHAT stopped the Vikings the first time around (i.e. 15 years earlier when they brought boy-Urban to America) from killing off the Indians? This is never answered. Surely, the 12 year-old Urban didn't kill them off that time, too??!! Why did they fail? Why did no-one read the first draft of the script and then make corrections in it after it was finished in one hour? On the positive side, there is some very nice photography and the Norwegian Baddies have excellent-looking (if absurd) gear. And the movie is watchable, even though there are some moments of tedium in the first 20 minutes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why did so Many Reviewers Get it Wrong?!?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I rented Pathfinder not really knowing much about it other that the cool fantasy picture on the DVD cover. Actually there was not even a synopsis on the DVD case which is certainly a warning sign. Before I popped this movie into my player and experienced it on a large home theater I looked it up on IMDb (where else) and my heart sank after reading mostly negative reviews with an overall rating of 5.5. The most prevalent title was "Worst Movie I Have Ever Seen." There are some terrible movies that for some reason I just love, so I hoped this was one of them. Well, it wasn't ? not because I did not love it but because it was not a terrible movie! I was very impressed with the action scenes but what really made me sink into this simple story was the cinematography. The entire movie was shot in kind of a gray tone that made me believe it was 600 years ago. The acting was mediocre but that worked fine for this unimaginative storyline. Viking barbarians want to colonize an area populated by Native Americans and do it by killing and burning everything in sight. I did like the hero (a Viking child left behind many years ago who become the savior for the tribe). I even thought the romantic interest between the hero and Native American woman was done fairly well. All in all I had a great time with this movie and I don't think it was entirely because the reviews had set my sights so low.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Pathfinder was good in the sense that it wasn't stupid. They made a real effort to keep the movie from being stupid. You could buy it on DVD without fear of regretting spending your money. On the other hand, it wasn't great. There was little to no duologue. Karl Urban probably had less lines in this than in Riddick. It is about an hour and a half of just watching action irregularly punctuated with a conversation or two. However, if you get off on Viking pictures and you like yourself some He-Man/Conan/Barbarian action and you can't bide your time for Pitt to act in some reinvention of it, then it would be real good. It had some good action scenes in it. They actually had something like an 'action-based plot'. No subtitles needed for this flick. you could be stone deaf and still get as much out of this picture as the next man. But if you could content yourself with just watching Urban, spend your money and enjoy. If you want Sean Penn kind of duologue and plot, try elsewhere.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above line wasn't in the picture, but it's always been one of my favorite sayings. You just never know how things might turn out when you do them, and often they end up either pretty well or quite awful. I was hoping going into this viewing that I might see something very worthwhile like a Rambo version of a young Viking turning his back on his countrymen in a battle for survival in the deep woods. Or they could have gone with the Fenimore Cooper story of the Deerslayer hero raised by his chosen people who must battle both the bad Indians and the bad white guys. Instead, they pretty much followed the plot line of the kid leading the bad guys away from the villagers as the original PATHFINDER had done in the Norwegian film of the same name 20 years earlier. In doing so, they made just a fair remake of what could have been a great story. There was very little back story of the Ghost's Viking life and even less of his formative years spent with his new foster family. This would have given the Ghost character much more depth and made him someone we could care about. As it was, he was just the sword-wielding Indian wannabe taking on the evil Viking raiders,so who could blame his erstwhile allies from totally buying into his newly discovered loyalty to them against his own race. The romance lacked much spark between the hero and his girl, and the action scenes were only marginally effective, except for a very good chase scene down the mountainside. The set director, however, did a fine job of recreating the ancient villages and the costumes were quite good, even if they were a bit fanciful from an historical notion of how the Vikings might have looked. At first, I disliked the black-and-white effect of the lighting, but I think it added more than detracted from the visual effect of the film overall. This was, after all, an unusual way of looking at how the first encounters between the two cultures would have gone, so seeing history in a different light was done here literally. As for the historicity of the film, I think there could have been just a little bit of humanity shown by the Vikings and maybe a bit of the savagery by the Indians that they possessed before this encounter and especially how these raids would have engendered more of a warlike spirit if they had been relatively peaceable heretofore. As a lover of westerns, it was refreshing to see the roles reversed in this early saga of cowboys versus Indians. I would say I got the better of the bear this time, but it did its share of gnawing on me before the battle was over. Dale Roloff</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Almost good...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The trailer of this film was actually quite good. I've been craving for a good R-rated action film, with violence, action and corny dialogues in all its glory.The fact this a full release B-movie (or lower A movie) made the prospect even more appealing.The first thing that struck me about the film were its visuals, the dark twilight atmosphere has been exploited in many movies but this movie is up-there with the best as far as capturing the rustic beauty and well as the threatening nature of the far north. It may almost be old but the visual created in this film are still beautiful, the talent carries across in the cave scenes and indoor scenes as well with great shadows and all. This is the clearly the department in which the film excels throughout.After the first few scenes i actually expected much more from this film, and that may have affected the ratings a bit.The movie is somewhat of an exploitation film, the real exploiters of the Red Indians were the whites/cowboys and clearly the exploitation continues till date thanks to the stereotypical portrayal of Red-Indians in cinema, this movie continues the trend with the prophecy, the elder, and what not. There is no way the real stories ever going to be told but its still a good change to see the Indians actually winning even its solely due to a white man (hehe).Not that any of the above matters, the story of this film, is merely and excuse for the filmmakers to display their abilities in a limited budget, with some brilliant visuals and some well choreographed but still realistic fights, some great (although historically inaccurate) costumes, a decent storyline and some decent actors.Romance rears its ugly head but surprisingly and luckily there wasn't a kiss at the end, the scene that was the staple of action films but is quickly becoming the staple of action movies nowadays.The movie would have been better off if there were some less stereotypical drama and some more action, for a angry man Karl Urban had too many drama scenes.The dialogues were mostly corny but there were some good ones like the spring and the winter one, once again this is a B-movie and the dialogues were definitely better than the ones in most B-movies.Acting was decent and although Karl is good with the serious roles, he definitely has to work on some humour even is its cold humour, all action stars need to display a streak of humour and unless he does the same there is no hope for him.The rest of the cast did a decent job as well but no one really stood out as being particularly bad or good.The action scenes were the second best part of the film with the chase in the mountain particularly standing out.The action was brutal and violent often purposefully so, but I'm not complaining,would have loved to see a better ending though.In the end this is a decent B-movie that falls short of good thanks mainly to a really weak storyline, only decent acting and dialogues, and the lack of any defining moment or scene.The forgettable nature of this movie is its main downfall and save for the great visuals,a couple of scenes and one dialogue its difficult to recollect anything really good(although nothings really bad) about this movie.Also the editing seemed jarry and i don't know if it was because of the censorship issues in India or it was just bad.Not as bad as its made out to be and watchable if your a fan Action B-movies, a really good home-theater is a must to enjoy it though, as I only felt the slight impact of this move by watching it in the theater (at matinée prices off-course).Rent with ordinary B-movie expectations.+s excellent visuals, a couple of good scenes/dialogues,meets low expectations,very brutal.+/-s decent acting and actors/actresses (my take what more can you expect its a B-movie),nothing is really bad (which can be counted as good).-s fails to rise above the ordinary, very forgettable.total 6/10 (met my low expectations but seriously after the first few scenes i expected more, even the adoption scene was actually good and i expected the drama too, to be of better quality then what was delivered, in the end my new expectations were let down, but the movie still managed to be OK.)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The above is a misquote from the lovable, bigoted patriarch of All In The Family. No points for guessing which word I changed, and what it was before. But what was funny in the 1970s is now a cliché Hollywood attempt at catering to white guilt.This movie pretty well follows the same formula that Quigley Down Under and, more recently, Avatar follow: the Dances With Wolves formula. The story is about a child-Viking who lands in North America and gets separated from his people. Raised by Indians, he eventually leads them against his own sinister race, when it returns to bring oppression and genocide. His new nation, while noble and virtuous, is ultimately helpless and backwards, (that's right--it's not entirely about political correctness) and would be facing a route and certain extinction were it not for this great white hope.Now, I'll tell you what would be novel: a movie based on the hypothesis that the indigenous Vikings of Greenland where exterminated by the ancestors of the Inuit. I'd love to see that! (In the same way I'd love to see the Toronto Maple Leafs win a cup: not gonna happen.) What I'd not like to see are the riots that would follow.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's been five years. Five long, hard years, and me and my friends still joke about that day... that dark, unforgettably horrible day where we went to see pathfinder.There was nothing enjoyable about this film. I don't even need to review it. It was literally the worst day I've ever spent at the cinema.There are 'worse' films that exist. Some are 'so bad it's good', but sometimes you burst through that and fall into 'so bad it's utterly terrible'. This film falls into the latter category.It's been a while and I wasn't quite the film fan that I'm training to be today but the problems still linger in my mind even now. I'll break down what I remember into five, easy to digest problems. Problem one, the sound. The 'score' was terrible the entire film. I believe there's about 17-22 seconds of tribal drums that are on repeat throughout the whole film and that's it. There's very little dialogue (problem two) but no action to replace it so you better get used to that beat. Problem three is poor characters. Not much needs explaining here, we've all seen these sorts of films where the characters have less dimensions than the women of 1884 novella "flatland." I'll finish up briefly with: problem four, the final nail. Plot could not be more terrible.Do I recommend this movie? No. Do I dare you to watch it? Yes.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>There are not too many new Viking movies out today which take root to enthrall audiences. Here is one directed by Marcus Nisped, which despite my reluctance to view it, surprised me to no end. The film is called " Pathfinder " and stars Karl Urban as 'Ghost.' It's the story of a Viking boy who, legend has it, accompanies his father to the New World 600 years before Columbus. His Father discovers his son's reluctance to murder Native American children, angrily explodes, whips and abandons his son to the strange and forbidden land. The boy is traumatized, left behind, but later found by a kindly native American woman, then adopted by a Spiritual leader called the Pathfinder. (Russell Means) Growing up amid his adopted tribe, the boy grows to manhood and becomes an integral part of his tribe against the returning Vikings. Unlike other films which includes the same elements, this movie contains superb acting and is further loaded with exciting, action-oriented black scenes. With Moon Bloodgood providing the romance element Starfire, there are compelling reasons to enjoy the touching film. Among the other fine actors is Clancy Brown as Gunnar. All in all, I highly recommend this story to anyone seeking good old fashion Viking vs Native America confrontation. Well done! ****</fullReview>

They break all the rules of continuity and during the action sequences , and the whole movie, it is way to difficult to tell what is happening. For a movie that is mainly about action you think they could have gotten at least that right.Marcus Niespeil is a horrid director, and it makes me cry that he is doing the new Conan. That will most likely be a half retarded shakefest as well. Carl Urban, what are you doing here?I whole heartedly do not recommend this. i recommend that if you find a copy you burn it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>You might think, as i did, that the concept of a brutal Viking invasion of North America circa A.D. 900 might be rather interesting. To see the legendary Indian braves face the feared Norse berzerkers would certainly pique my interest, but alas Pathfinder fails to deliver on all fronts. There is basically no plot that the audience can comprehend. The cinematography is terrible, everything is dark and murky and the shaky "action camera" does not help at all. As for the action, (i hesitate to use that word) is mind numbingly boring and ill choreographed, but at least it's better than the dialogue, which is as pointless and banal as it comes. If you see this movie for free, you paid waaaaaaay too much.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I watched this one with NO expectations. I enjoyed the action and the minimalist qualities. The film looks great, and the action is enjoyable. It is a film where a little is a lot. The natural settings are great, and the lack of well-known actors is a blessing.I read some reviews complaining about historical accuracy and absurdities in the plot. My response: Who cares! It is an ACTION movie. The genre is absurd.Regarding offending Native North Americans or those of "Viking" background, lighten up. The film is just an ACTION movie. Yes, the Vikings are blood-thirsty savages who looks wonderfully scary (perfect ACTION movie villains) and the Indians are too "wise" yet out-gunned and need a "white" man to help them. So what! It is an ACTION movie trying to do something a bit different.If you like ACTION movies with different settings and want to go on a mindless, fun journey, watch this movie...just don't expect it to be something it wasn't intended to be.It is just an ACTION movie after all.</fullReview>

I enjoyed the cultural rituals, costumes, the battles, hooves pounding, swords clanking... I was completely entrenched. I don't understand all the bad reviews, maybe I'm not as schooled on the comparisons or data mentioned, but as a watcher who enjoys medieval and native American type movies...I really liked it.

I thought the cinematography was excellent and loved the over saturation of color. I often wonder if the conditions were nearly as cold and wet as they appear in the film, and if it was,how uncomfortable it must have been to perform dressed the way they were. I will have to say that i had originally thought this was another WWF production with some of the acting skills in the movie. It often seemed like they were reading the lines.

		<fullReview>Pathfiner is the story of Ghost, a young boy haunted by visions of bad, evil vikings doing bad things to good, nice village people. So Ghost goes out to do bad things to the bad guys. And that's pretty much it. It's Jason Bourne 1000 years ago. It's hard to think such as potentially great, brooding epic movie could be so linear and simple.Pathfinder could have been a fantasy, but its not. Pathfinder could of been an action movie, but its splatters blood of dark vikings all over the white snow. It's an undefining film, it has no memorable action sequenced or fights. It has no moral fibre or brain. It is only the haunting vikings that add any depth to this movie, with their spine-chilling horns and deep Norse breath. The acting is also as chilling, but in the sense it's chillingly bad. Ghost has one, mediocre facial expression, and when in peril he looks like he's lost on the final level of Space Invaders.Though the darkness of the film and its attempts to frighten audience gather some merit, the filler between the heavy, samey action scenes is it's main pitfall. It questions nothing, does nothing, plodding along in the blindingly white snow, before plunging into the freezing water and never emerging.</fullReview>

I mean its winter for crying out loud and this poster boy viking is running around half naked. I am aware that its a legend, but even legends need some amount of realism.

It's a bit odd to see the Norsemen using bows, and the helmets are apparently inaccurate, but it's a pretty good story and it certainly kept my attention.Try it out.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Wonderful to look at, Terrible to Watch..</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I saw a preview for Pathfinder while watching a lionsgate film and thought it looked very promising indeed, oh how trailers can be deceptive.Pathfinder is the story of a young viking boy who gets abandoned during a battle between his Viking clan and a group of native Americans. The boy is then raised by the native Americans. A decade or so on the Vikings return and it is up to the boy to now protect his adopted people.This film was horrible and may have been the worst film I have ever seen (second only to anything Uwe Boll has created). My first and biggest gripe was the spoken language, the vikings spoke in their native Swedish tongue accompanied by English subtitles which really added to the authenticity of the film. However on the other end of the film you had the native Americans who for some reason spoke in a sort of modern American slang... why exactly the director and team thought this sounded good I will never know.Secondly the acting was by far the worst I have ever witnessed there was no connection between any of the actors and at no point during the film was any emotion conveyed at all. Plus I can only remember about five lines of dialogue being spoken throughout the whole film.The lighting in the film is also a major downfall, during some points of the film it is unclear exactly what you are looking at because it's so dark.Overall the film was so tedious, drawn out, disjointed and the worst thing is the film had a lot of potential, I just wish Zack Snyder (300 director) had directed it and then maybe this film would have been worthwhile to the movie industry.With all that said and done I still gave this a 1.8/10 which means there most have been something that impressed me, well in fact there was two things, though they weren't significant enough to improve the film a great deal. Number one the setting for the film was fantastic, I believe the film was shot in Vancouver, Canada and it was simply beautiful. Number two and the final thing to impress me was the Vikings, they were the only authentic thing about the film; the costumes and the fact that they spoke in there native tongue was a great feature of the film.Overall, if I was given the choice of watching this film again or watching paint dry for two hours I would most definitely choose the latter.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>'Pathfnder' begins with 'Ghost', a young viking who was abandoned by his kind and grew up with natives who took him in. When the vikings savage other native American tribes, he steps in to fight for his saviours. Clichéd and formulaic, this would ideally cater for teens, but consider this: how many times have you gone to the cinema to see a mainstream (over hyped) film, only to leave feeling disappointed? Many, in my experience. It is very rare to be able to go to the cinema these days and see something that is simply just entertaining. Having watched this at home and having not even heard of it in advance, there was no expectation whatsoever. Hence, I saw this for what it is: a below average narrative with moderately memorable characters yet (fairly) exciting fight scenes and beautiful visuals. Admittedly, I did fall asleep from when Ghost left with the mute following and awoke to find the Indian leader being ripped apart (literally) by the vikings. From there, I was engaged right through to the end.Admittedly, the ending was disappointing - but so what, it was the end! I had been entertained by the scenery and the vikings right up until that point. This film does not even attempt to cater for any high intellectual readings or ambiguities, which I think is refreshing.I will remember it for having some pretty horrific villains who enjoy limitless cruelty. Why? Because they can.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A lot of people out there make big budget cliché-ridden movies all the time. A large number of them are not worth remembering. Some are not even worth watching. But in this movie, cost effective entertainment has been maximized. There is no big shot actor in here, but it is a well-crafted piece of cinema. Not deviating from what the movie is about, (Viking-exterminating while keeping the girl safe, of course!) director Marcus Nispel (evidently, he knows the appeal of gore!) never bores his viewers for a single moment. No nonsense dialogues, engaging score, low light environments with a touch of myth, (ash coloured filter does its magic) this movie is not at all a bad investment of time and rental money. Many has compared it with Conan or Tarzan. But this movie is better than any Conan any day, (apart from the consideration of nudity, since this movie really doesn't have any) because it showed all it could afford to show, i.e. a pure adventure movie, not a CG extravaganza that never really could set a standard for anything.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A stunningly artistic film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie for it's beautifully stunning and original cinematography, intelligible symbolic casting, stage design depicting era-esquire yet artful representation.... A very beautiful film. The costume is phenomenal; exaggerated, and portrays extremely barbaric foreign invaders. The natives are portrayed as extremely organic and peaceful warriors. Though the only downfall is that it is not historically accurate as proof has been discovered that the viking and Old Norse folk were farmers who very much lived in harmony with the land and explored looking for "free" land in which to live; land outside of royal taxings so it is less than probable that they did any pillaging at all.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I'm kinda out of practice writing reviews. I think starting with 300 or so I let myself relax a bit and simply started watching movies without feeling the need to write a review. With the obvious haters of the movie I guess I decided to chime in. This is the sort of movie one could leave their brain at the door. I think for the most part I'll take my brain thru the door. There are points in the film I drop my brain down for a moment. But for the most part the time flew. It's not entirely been often that I'm drawn into a movie. Especially a movie with clearly poorly done editing. As in the editing is so poor in spots that it causes confusion to the viewer. Sometimes the acting is absurd like say Russell Means in the water with Karl Urban acting out of character. So the movie might have needed another director, but was done well enough to be an okay film. Certainly not in a worst of list. Maybe the sequel that should have been for Conan. I see the movie more borrowing from Conan than Apocolypto as I've read. As for the movie being racist. Against whom? So many classic films are racist against Native American's, this one sure isn't. I'm not going to berate a film because it might be factually incorrect. Braveheart gets far better reviews, but will get the same laughs from the history professors.For the second time I see (the first being On Deadly Ground with Joan Chen playing a native) they've used another Asian (pegged a Eurasian. never heard that term before.) Wish there were more true Native American's playing Native Americans. Not that I think the actress playing Starfire is bad. On the contrary, she's quite beautiful. And she looks the part, but it's simply an observation.6/10Quality: 6/10 Replayable: 4/10 Entertainment: 9/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>When the final movie is filmed and the list of the greatest movies of all time is released it is safe to say that Pathfinder will be nowhere to be seen. This is as it should be though, the director of Pathfinder wasn't setting out to make art. You won't finish this movie and be inspired to change the world, you won't look for this at the next Oscars. You might however be inspired to strap on every pot and pan in your kitchen and pretend to be a Viking.This is the gift of Pathfinder. In a world where every movie is expected to say something, win something or bring in more money than God, Pathfinder says NO. Instead Pathfinder says sit down, switch off and enjoy the ride. Huge scary Vikings attack Native Americans and it is up to Ghost, a Viking child abandoned by his own people and raised by the Native Americans to turn the tide in a series of great set pieces.You'll wish there was a toy line for the characters so they can take on your treasured Clash of the Titans action figures in a battle to the finish. This is a fun movie that you'll look back on fondly in years to come, but get the Unrated edition because, well, more gore is always a good thing.The performances are all solid and Karl Urban appears to be the inheritor of the Kurt Russell gift of aging to suit the movie you are in. This film is lots and lots of fun and this unashamed style of movie making deserves to be supported.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karl Urban to the rescue</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>While on a North American raid a young viking boy refuses to kill a defenseless Native American woman and her child so is left behind be his evil fellows. He is then raised by the kindly Native Americans and grows up to be Karl Urban. When the vikings return, this time lead by Clancy Brown, Karl shows his people that their spears and arrows are nothing against the might of the vikings, and that only he, Karl Urban, can stop them and that they best just run and hide.The viking warriors in this movie are so cartoonishly evil it would be laughable if they weren't somehow made to be so boring as well. They dress with so many skulls, horns and spikes it's as if the filmmakers thought the orcs in The Lord of the Rings were too warm and fuzzy looking. Also every shot of the invading vikings has them backlit through the trees with large amounts of smoke, to the point you had to assume that some of the viking crew were providing the illumination for effect.Not to be spoilerish, but obviously this is well documented fact, that Karl Urban defeats the vikings and the Native American people were never troubled by white man again.</fullReview>

But if you want to read on, it would be better, if you have watched the remake, too, since I will be pointing out some differences and spoiler some things ...Let's begin with the main character. Karl Urban is much more active and is more of a fight machine than the original actor in Ofelas. Urbans character did get a further motivation for his hatred against the "enemies" (don't ask me how they call themselves, it was too much mumbo jumbo for me to really care). With this vengeance wish filling up his heart, he offs enemies like flies ... If that's your cup of tea, enjoy, also if you enjoy silly moments, where the protagonist jumps in front of a whole group of enemies, just to pick up a sword and escape, than you're in for a treat here ... (they wouldn't have noticed him, if he wouldn't have jumped "right in").The action scenes, are quite good (in the unrated version, haven't seen the other one). It's a shame then, that so much of the original story has been changed. It should've been a good thing, but it's not. At least not for me, but since you're reading this, you made up your mind, too! :o)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Visually stunning this film is okay but never seems to be getting anywhere</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Vikings come to America to raid the land and no one survives, except a boy who grows up to be Karl Urban. 15 years later more vikings return and the set about killing every Indian they find. Unfortunately Karl has now grown up and is willing to take on the intruders single handedly.A remake of an Oscar Nominated foreign language film in Lap that was based on the legend of a boy who promised to take an invading army to his people and managed to lead them into the hell of the wilderness, only reset in America 600 years before Columbus. While this makes for a visually stunning film it also makes for a film that is more style over substance.I saw this film a few months back upon its release to theaters and I found it better than the reviews made it out to be. Certainly no great work of cinema, it does have visuals to spare that are thanks to a completely historically inaccurate depiction of the viking raiders, these are the guys from Molly Hatchet album covers not Sweden or Denmark or Iceland. They are also incredibly vile and evil and completely unlike any accurate account of vikings I've ever run across- which means they are perfect movie villains. The problem is that with all the armor they where you can't tell one from another so the fact that Clancy Brown is their leader is ultimately pointless.Watching this film again in the unrated form I didn't really notice much of anything different other than copious amounts of blood and limbs flying about.Clearly some, if not all of it, was added digitally which makes me wonder was any of it really necessary. The addition of say 10 extra minutes didn't seem to add anything, except perhaps a sense that the film never quite gets on with it. I don't hate the film, but I really do wish that someone had thought to pace the film better, maybe an occasional fight in real time might have helped (every fight seems to be in slow motion which must add at least 15 minutes to the running time).Its an okay time killer, and probably something you can wait for cable for.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not great, but....</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...I don't understand why Pathfinder was received so poorly. Let's address some of the complaints: Historical Inaccuracy - If you want historical accuracy, go watch a documentary. This movie wasn't made to inspire debate on history or for people to be offended by who their ancestors were and how they're depicted. This is a fictional story about one man versus a group of men who destroyed his family. I don't know if vikings were as obnoxious or evil as portrayed and frankly I don't care. No human is without his evil, so to become indignant about something like this is shallow and simple-minded. It's just a movie. Go with it.Bad Acting - I don't see how bad acting can be when there is so little actual dialog in the movie. Perhaps that was the problem? If that is the case, then I would agree. The movie is made to be action-packed, yes, but I would have enjoyed some more in-depth dialog throughout. It seems as though a large portion of the movie's sound is just grunting and sword clashing. But did I believe the protagonist was upset his people were killed? Yep. Did the actors playing the vikings seem evil and unyielding? Yep. Were the battles fraught with real energy? Absolutely. Sounds like fair acting to me, at worst.Rushed Scenes - This one, I agree with, to some degree. The story really could have used much more fleshing out. The movie seems to happen so quickly you may sometimes find yourself feeling "lost in the sauce", but not to a point that the movie becomes hard to enjoy. The plot was definitely moved along at a somewhat hustled pace, but it's not as if Pathfinder was to be some deeper-meaning movie that you'd need time to comprehend. It's about a guy that's peeved and wants revenge. How much depth could you possibly need? The scenes are lush and beautiful, the action is incredible, and movies are better fast-paced than sluggish from my point of view. If you cannot enjoy a movie, purely for its entertainment value, then I pity your jaded existence. I didn't watch Pathfinder expecting to learn something new or walk away thinking differently. I expected to be entertained for an hour or two, and I was.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>A movie like this always depends more on action than on story! So people who expect a decent story should find another movie to watch! The plot is simple but effective! It makes you care for the main character! Karl Urban doesn't say much but does have some serious screen presence! The supporting cast,especially the actor who portrays the pathfinder gives some comic relief! Other than that the movie is far too serious! If "Pathfinder" didn't take itself so seriously than it would have been better appreciated than it did! As I said earlier this movie is about the action! Bloody and gory! If you like that sort of a thing than you will love "Pathfinder"! I must admit that the action scenes have a certain style (slowmo blood like in the cut scenes of ps2 game "God of War")!

		<shortDescription>Has a lot going for it...really....a lot and yet something is off the mark</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember months ago seeing a preview for Pathfinder once and thinking 'Hey that looks okay' but then I never saw another preview and it slipped off my radar until I saw it at my local video store and decided to give it a whirl. That might be where Pathfinder went wrong was with it's advertising because I see A LOT of movies and the fact I only saw it previewed once is a little strange. I was literally blown away by a few key things in Pathfinder and yet something was unmistakably missing from the film and to be honest I'm not sure I know what it is. First of all the film is an absolute violent romp. The numerous kills from beginning to end are just gory and well done and blood splatteringly terrific. Second of all the scenery and cinematography is downright brilliant. German director Marcus Nispel, who has done nothing more than music video documentaries really, captures this gray and barren landscape with this gritty and violent feel to it. Nothing is brilliant or stands out and everything is very bleak. He uses it very well and it still really outstanding. For the record Nispel is also currently working on a big anticipated film of mine (Alice) and I hope he can carry over that mood to that film.Perhaps one of the shortcomings of the film is the lack of being able to tell who is who especially when it comes to the Nords. They don't spend a lot of time establishing characters from the Native side except for a very few key players. Action background actor Karl Urban moves to the front for his first real starring role. Urban has been in over a dozen action films but never truly been at the forefront. He does a good job in this film and really does capture attention and leads the film perfectly. He is a great hero and it's fun to watch him slicing up the bad guys. Moon Bloodgood plays Urban's love interest, the daughter of 'the Pathfinder' from another tribe. She is alright in the role but despite having a lot screen time, especially in the latter half of the film she never really impresses or stands out. Russell Means is her father and The Pathfinder and he is good as well. He has a lot of wisdom to bestow and he is important to the story line but ultimately does not stand out either. I would like to comment on the performances of the lead vikings who are brutal and brilliant as a group but to be honest I wouldn't even know who was who unless they were described by what happens to them rather than names. None of them really stand out more than any other and despite them being amazing villains as a group nobody stands out a lone.Although I sound like I'm downing on the vikings because you don't really distinguish one from the next they are also one of the great things about this film. The Nordic men are terrifying. They are completely mortal and never appear as anything more but you look at these hulking men in their strange and stunning costumes with their glaring eyes and you become as terrified as the Natives are and would have been. The costume designer did an incredible job making them look downright terrifying. With some attempt at Native Lore and an attempt at capturing certain rituals the film is mostly a blood bath made from an action mainstream point with very little plot other than to rid their land of these viking invaders with the help of one of their own who was left behind during a much earlier raid and he was raised as one of them. There just isn't a heavy story or any character who is really focused on or explored but rather the film is simply a hack 'em up gore-fest and I think that's what it is lacking because you can have both but they don't even try. It's not epic or historical and it's not a long drawn out ordeal either, in fact the blood starts to splatter within 2 minutes of the film. Still if you like that sort of thing you might really enjoy Pathfinder but don't expect depth to it. 7/10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't know if I'll have any spoilers here or not. I don't know how to spoil such a spoiled movie. But just in case, beware. I might ruin a perfectly awful film for you.I've hauled hay in intense Midwest heat in my youth and I'm telling you honest, it was harder to watch this movie than any barn I stocked hauling hay, wasp stings included.The very hard part for me was I thought I could feel where this whole idea was coming from. Like an earlier viewer, there was a lot of Tarzan and Conan stuff going on but, Holy Cow, did this miss the boat.I made myself finish it then turned on all the lights and found a box of Crayola Crayons and dumped the on my desk to stare and absorb the sheer beauty of color. I fired up my TV and went to the cartoon channel for more color. Then I went shopping in my library of DVDs for an antidote. I popped in a secret treasure of mine called Nightwatch. It was sufficiently "the other end of the spectrum" enough to bring my world back in balance.This is a potentially good film if it only understood what ... a good film was. It's got action, revenge, all kinds of macho stuff going on, great slow-mo scenes that would look great on a T-Shirt, way to little romance, really ugly and repulsive bad guys, great scenery for a Gothic kind of Halloween theme, gore and very well done violence. But it's all executed in barely visible dark shadows. And with no juice. Blah.Good guys win, bad guys win ... who cares?Good guy is going to win, you know this before you hit "play".But then, in the maddeningly wasted finale ... you don't care. What a horrible curse to put on a film ... the viewer doesn't care.Knockout photography. Probably a great script. Lifeless and aimless delivery."Conan the Barbarian" is absolutely awful but much better."Messing with Sasquatch" is superior to both.</fullReview>

The "Vikings" come as cartoonish almost, one dimensional brutes, carrying almost all the time ridiculous helmets. And they all seem much bigger than the Indians, even the white "Indian" who is one of them. The biggest disappointment was the fighting scenes, poorly edited and shot. The entire premise of the Vikings insisting on chasing the Indians who fled from one village even across the mountain ridge and away from the seacoast is so ridiculous it indicates the director is a pretty dumb person and thinks the same about his audience. And this is yet another film when the native Indians come across as some fantastically interesting, deep, spiritual, polite and likable people. In fact maybe James Cameron watched this film a few times too many. This script is similar but even worse than Avatar's.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Minor spoilers...To be honest, this movie is better than a whole lot of movies I've seen, assuming we by "better" mean "more entertaining". I was thoroughly entertained by this movie.As a Norwegian, and a bit of a history buff, I found the movie's depiction of the vikings utterly hilarious. Just the semi-drunken spotting of and commenting on anachronisms in the vikings style of dress and weaponry was entertaining enough to warrant watching the movie. And the language. The vikings spoke an awesome mixture of English, Icelandic, Norwegian, German and nonsense, and trying to decipher it without reading the text made for another valuable lesson in hilarity.And the shield/sleigh ride scene. Soooo awesome. Ghost had a lot of sleighs up at his little house in the mountains, didn't he? However, if watched in a more serious mood, I suspect that this movie would end up pretty low. A big part of the entertainment value I got out of it had to do with the fact that I am Norwegian, and a non-Scandinavian may very well find this movie a lot less funny. Also, any Scandinavian too stuck up to laugh of their heritage will be offended by this movie which I think managed to get one thing right: there was a sword in there at one point that looked passably historically correct.It wasn't the hero's sword, who we decided was probably just an elaborate beer opener.I want that beer opener...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Pathfinder: Unrealistic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not worth the minutes it takes from your life.We watched Pathfinder last night, and I found that from the beginning of the movie, many unrealistic situations made me laugh. I felt that I must watch it further, so I could further critique the rest of the movie.The young character, called Ghost upon his acceptance into the tribe, is not completely accepted, which throws the whole Native tribes taking-someone-in-as-their-own into the air. Comments made on his appearance seem to make the Natives in the tribe judgmental as they display ever-so-unconvincing speeches of wisdom. As he grows up, he is not allowed to be a brave as many young Native men become; Hence, highlighting his non-acceptance.Ghost was the offspring of vicious Vikings, who appeared to want to abolish any existence of Native Americans at all. They were very barbaric, enjoying all of the throat slashing and head decapitating they could manage to do in the few moments it took to wipe out a whole village. To see the Natives in the village being so easily overcome, running around like chickens with their heads cut off, like defenseless and ideal prey showed that they had no fighting skills, or no forms of defense. To my knowledge, Natives were very skilled fighters, agile and combative. I did not see any of this as the Vikings mercilessly hacked away at the scrambling villagers.I was only mildly surprised to see that not one of the tribes people had noticed the arrival of three huge Viking vessels, therefore making it an attack that was not expected. How could they not have seen this? They lived on the edge of the waters, and it is a wonder how they could pass up an opportunity to spot danger. It was like they lived as the land of the smurfs, everyone singing, playing and smiling as though there was not a care in the world, and that they could never be harmed.As Ghost begins his battles with the Vikings, his own kind, he appears to have hidden sword-fighting prowess as they were the only humans in that existence that fought with swords that "hundreds of arrows could never penetrate", as Ghost explained to the Natives. He then becomes the Pathfinder for the Vikings because he speaks the civil tongue. I have a hard time understanding Vikings of that nature referring to themselves as being of higher decent and state of class. They were practically animals, and their outfits signified that as well. I found that many of the comments the Vikings said were very cliché and perhaps even non-existent in that lapse of time. One of the Vikings refers to the main Indian-maiden-turned-love-interest Starfire the terminology of the definition female dog, calls the natives "Savages", and refers to themselves as "humans". Also, the natives called them "dragon people". How did they know what dragons were? Isn't that symbolism from the Asian continent?So Ghost begins leading the way for the Vikings and along the way, seems to be unmatched in his fighting ability as he takes out many of them single-handedly. The highlight of his fighting moments comes from his ride down the hill on a shield. Not only did he manage to cruise at full speed down the mountainside on a silver disc, but he avoided any run in with trees, shrubs, cliffs, AND crashing into other Vikings. These other Vikings were hilariously balancing on trees as they flew down the hill snowboard style, going the exact same speed as Ghost, who was on the shield. They were able to stand on these tree-like snowboard vessels and balance with ease as they swung weapons of torture, for example, a ball of spikes attached to a long chain. They were very on target as they did hit Ghost a couple of times. These abilities came from Vikings, who were mainly water-bred and born? That was a good laugh. I might have even slapped my knee at one point.I could go on but I have written hordes already. I just wanted to also add that I felt this movie was one of hilarity. It did not depict any sort of honest portrayal. If this movie was meant to make audiences laugh, it should have been labelled as a comedy. If you truly wish to see this movie, by all means, prepare yourself for stereotypical actions of Natives in a gathering, the rescuer being the white knight in Viking armor, and the Natives being portrayed as ignorant and pretty much useless considering that Ghost appears to be the only one to defeat his kind.I would not recommend that anyone watch this movie. I wonder if any of the people who acted in this movie are embarrassed of the final outcome. If not, I was embarrassed for them.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I rented this movie through on demand even after I saw the bad reviews on this site. I thought to myself - it cannot be THAT bad. Afterall, the preview looked decent enough. I was wrong. It is THAT bad. This is simply a movie where nothing seemed to work. The acting is truly atrocious and it seems as if absolutely no effort was put into writing any intelligent duologue. The action scenes could have been a redeeming quality - vikings fighting Indian villages sounds interesting - but no, this was also botched. It is impossible to tell what is going on due to ill conceived camera angles and poor editing. It really is frustrating to watch. At any given moment the main character could've been fighting one viking or twenty for all I knew (i'd refer to the character by name but i'm not sure they ever established a name for him, and if they did it certainly wasn't memorable).In short, the movie fails on all levels and is very tough to sit through.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To underline how awful this movie is, at one point the Vikings get clobbered because they are suckers enough to try to cross a river on thin ice! Misjudging ice? Vikings?? Right. The best thing that can be said for this film is that it gave a lot of work to some costumers, stunt men, horse wranglers and dog trainers. Plus a bear trainer. And the scenery is great. But that's another problem. It is obviously the Rockies in British Columbia, not the terrain of the eastern seaboard.Incredibly, having failed in any attempt to make the movie believable historically, or even entertaining as a human fable, the producers did one thing "right". Instead of everyone magically speaking English, the Native Americans speak English and the foreigners (Vikings) speak "Something Else" with subtitles. For me, the only interesting thing was trying to figure out what the "Something Else" was. I speak a bit of German and could understand many German-sounding words. Had the actors been Scandinavian or Icelandic (some of the film seems to have been shot in Iceland) I would have guessed their native language(s); however the names and the casting credits indicate Canadian casting of the "invaders". Could the producers of this turkey have gone to the trouble to create an ancient, prototype language? If so, the money and effort was spent in the wrong place.Edit: Later I found, by reading the forum comments, that the "language" was Icelandic severely mangled by English-speakers.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Action packed and quick-paced. I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. Karl Urban looks great and every scene in Pathfinder was brilliantly shot. Very realistic and beautiful. From beginning to end I was on the edge of my seat(or couch). When I saw the trailer to Pathfinder I thought, "W-o-w, this is a creepy one." It wasn't what I expected, In fact I didn't have a clue what was the plot. I just knew a man rebelled his own people. I watched all the bonus features via DVD rental from Blockbuster, and the physical effort it took these actors was making me tired! Good work everyone, and kudos to you especially, Urban! I give it a 10!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>The word "viking" should not be mentioned in this movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What this movie is about should be known by now (if not, read the other comments on here). I just want to explain why this movie is not worth your money, not even a rental.First, some people who are supposed to be "vikings" figure prominently in this movie. Now, aside from the fact that they speak a form of Scandinavian they have absolutely nothing in common with historical vikings. So anyone who want to see a movie about vikings, stay far away from this one. They look nothing like vikings, they behave nothing like vikings and so forth...Second, the movie is simply stupid in many ways. For instance, the main character "Ghost" apparently learns to fight with an iron sword completely by himself, surrounded by a stone age people who have never seen a sword before (so obviously none of them could have taught him). Sure, he might have seen someone fight with a sword while a child. Can you learn how to box by watching a boxing match at age eight and then never seeing something like that again? Sure, you can learn how to brawl, but can you actually box later at 30-something? And not only box - but box well enough to win a fight against someone who have been boxing their whole life? Because that is essentially what happens in this movie.Third, it is obvious that nobody involved in the making of this picture has ever been to Scandinavia. They talk about stuff like "eternal winter (in the vikings' homeland)" and about how the vikings "know everything about snow but nothing about spring"! What?? True, the winters in Scandinavia can be cold - down to about -22 ?F - but the summers can be as warm as 95 ?F. So the vikings would certainly know about spring.There are many more stupidities in this movie, but they are pretty well covered in the other comments here.The good stuff is that this movie looks pretty good (apart from the (panifully obvious) CGI blood that spurts in the fights), it has some cool shots and the vikings look cool - nothing like real vikings, but cool. But that is not enough to save it.Conclusion: Do not spend a dime to see this movie - it is not worth it. Which is a shame - we could use a good movie about vikings.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Viking invasion fails to impress</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This film was released in the UK this weekend and I went to see it on Friday night, whilst not realising due to my own stupidity that Fracture was also just released.So into screen 5 out of 6 (should have been a sign on opening weekend) I went.Now I went to see this film to be entertained. Vikings (or Dragon People) invaded America 600 years before Columbus and caused chaos. That was cool, I was OK with that - I'm not a historian, Viking or descendant from the Pathfinder tribe so I don't care how historically accurate the idea was. That wasn't an issue for me.A Viking ship ran a shore, killing everyone but a small kid who was found by the wife of the tribes leader and after a comedy town meeting with the village elders just agreeing with everything - the idea the kid will bring evil was followed by a chorus of agreeing mumbles and nods but the fact that the kid will change the tribes destiny was also greeted by the same response and as this idea was put forward last this was the notion they went with and the boy stayed.The cute kid grew up into Eomer (who we don't see enough of in films) complete with ass-less chaps and was known as Ghost, who flirted with Pathfinders daughter, apparently called Firestar according to IMDb but I will take their word for it as her name wasn't mentioned at all in the film that I can remember. This is where I got confused about the two tribes who met at the market and who belonged with each tribe. It was hard to know who was the leader, who was related to who etc etc. Not that it mattered as about 10 minutes later the Vikings had returned and killed Ghosts tribe.Now I don't mind violence in films. I can handle gore and sword fights but Pathfinder has some pretty gruesome killings, which in all fairness made sense to have it that way as Vikings aren't known for PG-13 killing sprees, they were violent people (well according to popular belief anyway) so having them act that way and showing a bit on blood etc was fine. Although I am glad they didn't show Ghosts kid friend being killed and his Viking father killing the girl at the start of the film cause that would have been to much.Ghost then ran into the other part of the tribe and warned them of the danger. There was a hint of a rivalry between Ghost and another tribe member over Firestar but this part of the storey got short changed and the rival was quickly killed by his groups over zealousness and they ran right into a trap meant for the Vikings and were quickly killed.There were some good set pieces. Crossing the ice was good to watch, even though it was done better in King Arthur and the climax with climbing the mountain was engrossing to watch.It was hard to tell just what time of year it was, there was snow, sunshine and lightening all in the space of a few scenes. I'm from Ireland and our weather is usually just rain so perhaps this is normal It was entertaining but there were many flaws.Ghosts first line was spoken with an English accent and the rest of his lines, and there weren't many, were spoken in an American accent, but this isn't the first time in a movie an accent has changed so that point isn't to major. The fact that the Vikings spoke completely in their own language, hints at the fact that the film took its self very seriously, almost to seriously. It was amusing that in Viking language it takes longer to say "get him" than "We will cleanse the land before we settle". This film wasn't improved by the Vikings speaking in their own language it would've worked just as well if they spoke with a "Viking like accent" Ghost seemed to be very fluent in the language after 15 odd years, he also seemed to remember how to fight well to.There were a couple of unintentionally funny moments too.After Ghost jumped into the waterfall a Viking looked into the waterfall for about ten seconds to make sure he had drowned. He then did this fantastic comedy turn complete with swooshing cape and skipped away. He looked like a cartoon robber carrying a bag of loot!! This cause a spontaneous burst of laughter from my group much to the disgust of the man in front of us as it clearly interrupted the conversation he was having (which lasted the whole film!) Another unintentionally funny moment was when the Viking all fell of the cliff whilst all tied together (this idea was really good though), the audience naturally assumed that they had all fallen to their death, only to discover about 10mins later they had only fallen to the next ledge a few metres down (Vikings are resilient!) The shot of the blackbird opening his wings and squawking was used about 4 times throughout the film.Overall I would give the film about 5/10. It was entertaining, but sometimes it was entertaining for the wrong reasons.You get the feeling that there is a better film in there somewhere. An extended edition with more interaction between the characters is needed, just so we get to know who is who. I would recommend that you see it in the cinema as it can make the average film seem more exciting. If you want to be entertained etc then yeah go and see it. When it comes out on DVD I wont rent it but if there is an extended version coming out then it would def be worth a look!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Epic Viking Battles</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>... are frickin' sweet. I knew i was in for a treat when I looked across the Blockbuster store-room and saw almost every copy of Pathfinder in stock the day after it came out. Beaming at me in a glory of viking berserker rage were clashing sword and battle ax. Fur clad and blood thirsty vikings beckoned me to grasp the DVD case to my tingling bosom. When I could finally tear my eyes away from the epic battle scene (complete with a viking warship) on the front cover... I read with uninhibited frevor the synopsis of this movie. "...graphic, hard-core, action -- packed with extreme battle footage -- plus an army of kick-a*s (YES! it said kick-a*s and they were kick-a*s) deleted scenes and special features! Savage Viking invaders bent on death and destruction..." I was already wet with anticipation but by the time I read the words "breathless, primal violence" I practically ran to the check out counter. This movie rocked my world, I sat with my own battle ax rested in my lap as gruesome scene after delightful gruesome scene pleasured my eyes and ears. Sure I focused more on my bowl of crunchy snacks during the useless plot scenes... but when those viking battle sequences exploded onto the screen I was held in rapt attention. Don't listen to those whiny a-holes complaining about plot or dialog or anything else. Those battle scenes made my nipples hard and thats a fact. Severed heads, fighting bears and frickin' blood thirsty VIKINGS: what more could anyone possibly need in a movie? If you have an answer to that question I dare you to e-mail me a better pick for a movie night.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Please, for your own sake if you are thinking about renting / buying / going to see this movie, DON'T. It's not as if I expected it to win any Oscar's when I set out to see it but I figured that if it had enough action it would keep me mildly amused.... I was wrong. The Plot was horrendous; I've never seen a cheesier story line. I'm not sure who wrote this thing but my guess is they haven't graduated grade school yet. And as for the editing, I think whoever was in charge of that probably was drinking on the job. I mean I'm no expert, but I figure someone should have caught the fact that in one shot there's ferns, moss and assorted vegetation all over the place and the next shot the whole place is covered with snow. I swear they didn't write a script but must have made up the movie as they went along. My guess is they just added the snow when it suited the story line.P.S. Adam, you owe me $13 for making me go see this piece of rubbish, that's money that could have been spent on beer.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I've read quite a few of the other comments from other people and I must say that I think they should all take a look in the mirror and try making a movie of their own before they dog on someone else so badly. I wanted to see this movie because I think Karl Urban is a fabulous actor and I thought it was high time that they gave him a movie of his own. For those other nerds out there who remember him from Xena and Hercules, he played four or five different characters in those shows. I was so excited when I saw him in Lord of the Rings and even more so when he was in Chronicles of Riddik. I would like to say that, for those of you who keep whining about "boo-hoo, the dialogue, the dialogue" , it takes much more talent to act with a minimum of speaking. When you have to convey everything about a scene with just facial expressions, a look in the eye, or few words, that raises you above all of the mediocre actors who couldn't cut it if they had to do that. Remember that next time you want to whine about something. If you think it's so horrible, shut up and make your own movie and then let me be a critic. Children!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This movie is has intensely violent has they come. The story of a boy who is left behind by his viking father, is adopted by American Indians. 15 years later when grows into a man(Karl Urban of The Chornicals Of Riddick, Doom) is feeling left out,cause he is not an Indian. But then the Vikings that abandoned him years ago led by Gunnar(Clancy Brown) slaughters the whole village that raised him. He soon declares revenge on them. Karl Urban does pretty well in this role, he looks like a combination of Tarzan and Conan, and he is built like an athletic swimmer. And Clancy Brown is good as the villainous Gunnar, he shore has not forgotten how to use a sword after Highlander(1985), not to mention he looks like Darth Vaders ancestor. The direction was a little sloppy. But still a great film, and the action was great also.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Skunk-beer-and-stale-popcorn Vomit.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of what was good about this story was completely ruined by poor direction from Marcus Nispel (director of The Very Best of Cher...if that tells you anything) and really wretched editing. From beginning to end, Marcus Nispel's drudgingly slow, poorly lighted work falls short on every opportunity to make either an artful movie, an action flick, or a dramatic film. Sadly, Nispel seemed to be going for the trinity without the experience or know-how to realize any one of the three.Throughout the film, none of the actors were given the dialogue or development necessary to bring their characters to life, so instead they simply drudge through the film merely hoping to reach the end...much like the audience. Any of the characters that could have been likable were virtually silenced and rushed in and out of their screen-time to make way for the barrage of extensively slow fight scenes. Unfortunately for the audience, Nispel seemed to love using the slow motion action sequence to an extremely unhealthy, nearly torturous degree.Consider, movie-lovers and would-be-directors, that the following points would have made the film so much better:1.) First, this film should have been brighter and more colorful in the emotional scenes, playing on the beauty of North America's forest lands (something akin to Last of the Mohicans). Instead, Nispel chose the constant dark din of an evil rain forest from Tim Burton's nightmares. It is understandable why Nispel did it, trying to convey the idea that this was a dark time for the peaceful, nature-loving Native Americans. But truthfully, even Burton would have favored some brightness and color over the constant bleakness.2.) Most of the action scenes should have run in real time like Jet Li's "Fist of Legend", or been sped up to have a harried urgency like Ridley Scott's "Gladiator" or the Jason Bourne flicks. More importantly, get rid of all the rehashed slow-motion stealth shots stolen from Stallone's "Rambo", Schwarzenegger's "Conan", and Norris's "Missing In Action" films. Those scenes have been done to death in modern movies! ***Note to all would-be-action-directors: Nothing makes the predictability of a crappy film more obvious than unimaginative action scenes stolen from bad action flicks.***3.) The characters should have been given more dialogue and an actual range of emotions, including supporting characters such as Jay Tavare's Blackwing and Nicole Munoz's Little Sister. We are never given the chance to care about these characters, so we never give a hoot about what happens to them, even though their roles are integral to the impact of the story.4.) The introduction of Ghost (Karl Urban) as an adult should have included at least five to ten extra minutes of his life within his own tribe, (before the onset of the Viking antagonists) for character development and emotional attachment to his adopted family. Without this, we again find ourselves not caring about important pieces of the story.5.) And finally, the Viking lords Gunnar (Clancy Brown) and Ulfar (Ralph Moeller) should have been given greater scope, so that they could be depicted as both incredible warriors and truly despicable beasts. We should be begging for them to die, yet admiring them for being truly impressive bad-ass bastards. Instead, they come off as no more frightening than Skeletor and the Shredder of the He-Man and Ninja Turtles cartoons, respectively. In the end, we feel cheated; especially considering that Brown has previously shown that he has the chops for playing versatile bad guys.All in all, this film looked bad, played worse, and stank of skunk-beer-and-stale-popcorn vomit the whole way through, courtesy of one truly bad director. Unless the "Alice" project with Sarah Michelle Gellar comes away with an Oscar and the title of Highest Grossing Film of 2008, Nispel looks like he'll be joining the ranks of crap action directors like Uwe Boll, Renny Harlin, and Rob Bowman.***Note to all of the good and gentle Buffy fans: Pray for Gellar. She'll need it.***</fullReview>

We both enjoyed the "film noir" appearance, which truly captured the essence of the movie. It is NOT a happy movie, so if that's what your looking for you sure came to the wrong show.To have it all filmed in color would of ruined it as far as we were concerned.Most of the Native American actors I have seen in other movies and they were great here. My first time to see Kevin Urban, he was truly believable in his part as were all the actors.I have only two criticisms, the "vikings" we're a bit on the silly side and the CGI goes on way too long.I don't want to write a spoiler, so will let it go at that.I have that issue with most "action"movies today. They take a scene that full of edge of the seat action, then just keep going with it.I say, make your point, scare the pants off us, then move on.If you like action movies and you like anything Native American, you will like this movie.Sincerely, Linda Hayes (Choctaw/Cherokee Nations)</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Prime example of modern-day Hollywood</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Acting, directing, and writing are apparently all dying fields. They've all been replaced with special effects, and apparently various people in Hollywood (namely those who produced this movie), think that means that they can make a crap movie and get away with it. Unfortunately, this movie didn't even have the special effects to redeem it. A lightning sequence was shown... and then minutes later the exact same sequence occurred again. The odds of that are just phenomenal, but I don't think that was even as impressive as the National Geographic footage of an avalanche that didn't even fit the scenery. But the "special effects" were nowhere near the worst of it. Plot continuity was horrid throughout. At one point, the Vikings tied themselves together, then fell like dominoes... then moments later were alive again fighting the lead (whose name was said once? maybe twice throughout the movie? Great character development, there). Now, don't get me wrong. I had a great time seeing this movie with some friends of mine. But if you aren't prepared to laugh at a pitiful attempt at a movie that makes Plan 9 from Outer Space look like a work of art, don't waste your time on this one.</fullReview>

If you want a good a cinematic masterpiece go see the Departed, Pathfinder seemed like one of those movies going in that there wouldn't be much of a plot- just a guy fighting for his survival. Surprise surprise, it was exactly what it was. Yah it may not be historically accurate, but come on its a movie.

I have to say the dialouge left something to be desired but other than that it made a good showing. The fight scenes were well done, especially the the ice sequence. I enjoyed that the main character Ghost (Karl Urban) wasn't made into some kind of super hero, just a regular guy caught in a bad situation. Karl did well with his role despite the afore mentioned dialouge, using his facial expressions and body language to further the emotional aspects of each scene without going too far and looking silly. Moon Bloodgood held her own, as did most of the other cast members. Overall, it was a good movie.

		<shortDescription>Visually spectacular with stirring music and inspired action scenes; not so strong in the story and script department</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>On the whole, "Pathfinder" is a decent and watchable film. Far from perfect, but I personally didn't think it is as bad as people make it out to be. Visually and technically, there is next to nothing wrong with it. The sets are stunning, with towering mountains, tall trees and very white snow, and the cinematography is stunning. Also the costumes are wonderful to look at, and the makeup particularly on the Vikings is outstanding. The score is stirring and brings real dramatic weight to the more tense scenes. The action scenes are truly spectacular with heavy emphasis on violence and a lot of chaos. However, the script is not as strong not absolutely terrible but parts are a little stilted. The story here is simple, I have no problem with films that have simple stories, but while there are a number of fast paced action sequences, the slower scenes are rather drawn out and very little happens to maintain interest. Also the pacing is uneven, too stodgy in places, however the acting ranges from good to so-so, Rusell Means in particular is very dignified in the role of Pathfinder. Overall, decent film but not a masterpiece. 7/10 Bethany Cox</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I almost died of boredom during this movie.It doesn't stand on any point of view. The plot is terrible: vikings cross the Atlantic in order to kill indians. They don't seem to prey on anything. Only kill and occasionally rape. They hate indians so much that they come a 2nd time fifteen years later to kill the survivors. The visuals are overall good but lack of innovation. Countless flaws on historical details; and weather; and any domain in fact.The script and the characters are terrible. As an example I d say that a viking is viciously wounded by Ghost, but later on, when he has many opportunities to take revenge, he is just absent of the movie.Action scenes are rather good, but don't make any effort to be believable. Its is all filmed in very short scenes, closed up; so the viewer may be surprised by such and such event, but apart from the hero, everyone else is always as surprised as the viewer. This lame trick is used at least 40 times.Some commentators blamed that the tribes were cliché hence the flick was racist. I don't agree with that. In fact the good guys say "Vikings have hatred. They have it in their veins. They cannot be different." hence the flick is racist.</fullReview>

They only had one or two colors bright to make them stand out extra well. Plus the times in which they lived were quite harsh. Yes the movie is violent , but again it also goes back to the times back then being quite violent. The battle scenes are REALLY WELL done.They are very visually appealing (as is the main actor) I like the fact that they use languages the peoples would have really used, or at least something close to it. Like apcolopto it adds a degree of realism. For people who are bothered by violent movies I would suppose this movie is probably not for you. If you can see a beyond the violence to other many aspects that make it a pretty decent movie, then I think you will like it. It also doesn't hurt that the lead male is SO FINE its almost a crime.</fullReview>

Most, especially those who are only marginally talented, will write with one overarching objective: to get his screenplay made into a movie and have a tidy payday. How to do this? Appeal to the powers that be who hold the purse strings. With political correctness raging world wide with an unassailability not seen since the Inquisition, few studio honchos would allow a film to be released that portrays Norsemen in a positive light. Whether it be by fashion or plot, White people can only be evil in Hollywood's eyes, and those of Germanic heritage, be they Norse, German, or English, are the very worst of all. The message of course is to feel BAD about yourselves, White Folks... you are all evil. Your only salvation is to fight against your fellow Europeans on the side of political correctness and kill your evil white brothers in the name of whatever "oppressed" race is the social liberal toast of the day. If you watch this film, you will find it very hard not to see it for the "hate whitey" propaganda it is, since it is really one of the more blunt and offensive examples of this I have ever seen. If you want to see another, watch King Arthur. Same sort of anti-Germanic dreck, though somewhat more watchable than this awful film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Too many critics and not too many critiques spoil the broth. Just watched this movie and I can't, for the life of me, see what about it which stirs a loin enough to hate it. The story's simple, editing is admittedly woeful, and the backdrop is stunning. The acting is stilted in places, but it's an action movie for goodness sake, and a bloody good one! Bits chopped and lopped off, heroes as clichéd as any other of the genre, and the padding of a love story. The camera-work was very arresting and as ugly/beautiful as the Black Robe (steamy, wet, darkly depressing but utterly gorgeous). A new twist to the discovery of the New World as a Norse Saga, and a laudable effort. But let's not get carried away with ourselves, it was a good, solid idea - much superior to others in it's sub-genre, but not a classic. The aesthetic criticism this movie gets is better reserved for the likes of Apocalypto and that New World drivel, Colin Farrell "acted in". It struck me as a bit of a Lord of the Rings in The Emerald Forest (a big story lost in a piece of heaven). Just sit back without preconceptions and enjoy, say I! It's only a movie!</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It's not a classic, but if you like Apocalypto, then it is similar with two cultures clashing. Add a little Rambo, and maybe a little Bond in the sledding scene, and you have the makings of a watchable movie.The cinematography was spectacular, and the fighting was bloody and gory. The vikings looked like something out of your worst nightmare - super costuming! Marcus Nispel (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) did a very good job. It is going to be interesting to see what he does with Friday the 13th next year.Karl Urban (The Bourne Supremacy, The Return of the King, The Two Towers) was a believable Rambo character. He makes me look forward to his "bones" role in the new Star Trek.I certainly wanted to see more of Moon Bloodgood (Eight Below) but I understand that it was Winter. :-) I don't expect a lot of fans for this film, as they have no fart jokes.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Karl Urban, how could you?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I titled this "Karl Urban, how could you?" for a reason. Karl Urban's done so many great movies and is an all around great actor. Okay, yes everyone loved the Lord of the Rings trilogy. But he's been great in many others too. And Clancy Brown was in Pathfinder too. How could you lose I say? I think you can tell I expected a lot from "Pathfinder". Well, it never delivered. Not even close!!! The acting was as good as it could be. But the writing (stay on strike, whoever wrote this) was awful. And worst of all, were the sound effects. The biggest sound effect joke came at one point when Karl Urban was running over some hills and in the background, from a distance, you hear grunting which, instead of reminding one of running, was more fitting for a porn movie!! It was purely dreadful.The whole thing simply didn't click. Pathfinder is a waste of your time and money. If you know what's good for you, you'll clear a path and find your way to any other DVD in the store or any other movies you can find in the trash bin.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>disappointing Hollywood-ized remake</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Over the course of this movie I realized that it was indeed based on the earlier work called I'd seen called Ofelas. While that movie was simple and low budget, it was also believable and charming. This remake takes shreds of the same plot and buries it under a gory pile of senseless violence and corny tragedy, turning this version into a Hollywood-ized shell of its predecessor. And then there's the setting:1. there were Native Americans living on the east coast2. Vikings did sail down to North America and were likely later driven off by the NativesAfter that, everything else in this movie appears to be historically inaccurate.. fairly offensively so. But even besides all of the factual and logistical blunders, the core plot has been turned to rubbish. No character's motivation makes sense in the end, the pacing is bad, clichés are use almost exclusively as transitions into the next slashing scene, and even these slaughter scenes - the meat and potatoes of this movie - are badly executed. It doesn't matter how many hairy chunks of viscera fly around the screen if there isn't even continuity enough to tell WHO those chunks belong to.Too much production value, not enough creativity. Disappointing.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Nispel does a 'Snyder'.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After his reasonably enjoyable updating of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (which was designed to appeal to the ADD afflicted youth of today), it would appear that director Marcus Nispel has gotten ideas above his station: he now believes himself capable of delivering an epic FX laden historical action/adventure. It's a delusional state which I call 'Zack Snyder Syndrome'.Nispel's effort tells of a Viking boy, Ghost, who is welcomed by a friendly Native American tribe after being abandoned by his own people. When, many years later, nasty Norsemen return for more raping, pillaging and all things Viking, the now-unbelievably-buff Ghost (Karl Urban) leads his surrogate family in a vicious battle against the hairy hordes from his homeland.Like Snyder's 300 (which followed his remake of horror classic Dawn of the Dead), Pathfinder suffers from an overblown script, dreadful acting, lousy dialogue, silly quasi-mythological elements, a complete lack of originality, and, worst of all, the over-use of digital trickery to imbue the movie with a 'style' that only serves to irritate?in this case, desaturating the colour until everything becomes a bland shade of grey.Also, like Snyder's film, Pathfinder proves to incredibly unexciting. Thanks to some particularly dreadful editing and Nispel's poorly considered direction, the movie's umpteen fight scenes are a confusing blur of flailing limbs and unconvincing CGI gore; likewise, the action scenes (most notably, a high speed sled chase sequence) are completely bereft of tension.Also serving to annoy is the sickeningly predictable portrayal of the two warring groups: as has been the case ever since the early 70s, when Hollywood seemingly decided to atone for its earlier portrayals of Native Americans as bloodthirsty savages, the 'Indians' are shown to be a peaceful and noble race; the Vikings, on the other hand, are no better than animals. It's a case of double-standards that sticks in the throat (maybe, in thirty years time, Hollywood will reconsider its unfair treatment of Vikings, who will, from that point on, forever be portrayed as sensitive new-age types, unfairly judged by history).Pathfinder is the sort of predictable trash that makes one long for the movies of yesteryear?you know, the kind with a decent story... and colour.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Not worth your time</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The other day I was with my girlfriend at Walmart. We usually make a stop at the $5 bin to see if there is anything interesting in it. I was rather surprised to find this film in it because it was such a recent release. I'll simply state that if there was a $1 bin at Walmart, Pathfinder would be in it.Shortly after I got back home, I decided I would put the DVD into my XBOX 360 and enjoy a nice, hot cup of hot coco while watching some Vikings ruthlessly slaughter Native Americans. (note - I am not a racist. I am implying the amounts of gore and not the innocent killings of many Native Americans.)There was nothing that ever really grabbed my attention while viewing this film. We never found out why the Vikings were there in the first place. It appeared that they are savages who hunt humans instead of deer. The editing wasn't very tight and the film really dragged along throughout the entire production. Perhaps this is why I fell asleep while watching or perhaps it was the amount of alcohol in my system, but probably not the latter. The only other movie I have ever fallen asleep to while watching for the first time was Terminator 3.This film is not worth your time. I thought it really looked entertaining when I saw the preview, but I was greatly let down when I watched it. I would much rather spend my time watching Transformers for the special effects than watch Pathfinder.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>uber-violent action film</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>With scenes lifted straight out of "The Last of the Mohicans" and "Alexander Nevsky," "Pathfinder" is little more than a 107-minute-long exercise in nonstop gore and bloodletting.Located in a sepia-toned forest that looks like a leftover set from the "Lord of the Rings" movies, "Pathfinder" chronicles the ongoing battle between a tribe of peace-loving Native Americans and a bunch of blood-thirsty Vikings who invade their land. As the movie opens, an Indian woman stumbles across a frightened little boy, the sole survivor seemingly of a Viking raiding party. She takes him to her tribe where he is brought up as one of their own. Then, after the boy has grown to full manhood, a new group of Viking warriors lands on shore to once again rape, ravish and pillage the native population ad infinitum and ad nauseam. The young man now gets to defend his adoptive people against his native one.Once we get beyond the corny, self-reverential dialogue and all the pantheistic mumbo-jumbo common to movies of this type, we're pretty much left with just the violence in the film, which is so constant and so over-the-top that it becomes utterly ludicrous after awhile. The mud-soaked, grungy look so painstakingly established by the costume and makeup departments is almost completely undermined by the fact that all of these 9th Century savages have the most amazingly glittery, perfectly aligned teeth this side of a Crest Whitestrips ad.Despite this rather amusing orthodontic anomaly, I'm afraid your enjoyment of "Pathfinder" will depend largely on just how many decapitations and impalings you're willing to put up with in a two-hour period.</fullReview>

Usually when you watch a bad movie, you have a feeling beforehand that it might not be that great, judging by the trailers for this however, it had a lot of potential. I wasn't even aware of the plot before i watched the film, just that it was similar to most sword and sandal affairs, but with vikings. Can't be that bad right? Wrong. This was literally one of the worst failures of a decent license i've ever seen. It was worse that Ghostrider...and i HATED Ghostrider. The acting was like something out of a school play. The plot was ridiculous. Some scenes were just absolutely horrendously bad. Vikings on sledges? Underwater sarcastic tribe leaders? and THAT scene where a gazillion Indians jump into a spike pit for apparently no good reason. Not to mention the historical errors. Horses? a ten year old that can speak perfect Nordic 15 years after leaving home? Let alone the fact he should have froze to death already. It really is laughably bad. Except no ones laughing.

		<fullReview>I was shocked when I watched this movie, only to find that it was a blatant rip off of Ofelas, which has been mentioned in other comments on this page. The ending is nearly identical and the translation of the title Ofelas . . . Pathfinder. About the time he takes the vikings through the mountains and suggests tying the men together I just kept thinking "no way, no way, what was that movie called?" I reviewed the extras on the DVD to see if they mentioned anything about the original. I was even more shocked to find that the original received no props and the new film was passed off as an original idea.For anyone who wants to watch a long film with more heads lopped off than words spoken, this movie is great. But don't expect historical accuracy or originality. These films that try to turn most every line (a total of what five?) into a catch phrase, this wolves battling bull . . . it's like heavy handed symbolism. The music, the tone of the voices basically scream "this is a cool catch phrase, check it out!" When did this catch phrase crap start anyway? The Matrix is where it got really bad.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>See the original by Nils Gaup</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Nils Gaup created the original Pathfinder. It's only on VHS tape, it may be very hard to find, but find it you should because it's beautiful, rich, exotic, heartfelt, exciting, frightening, strong, clear.When you've finished reading reviews of this film, find reviews of Gaup's &amp; read them! I noticed that the director of this new version credits Gaup for having inspired the new Pathfinder. Pitifully, he wasn't really inspired to make a good film, because he he punctured &amp; deflated a timeless story made by a real artist.This current version modifies the story line but doesn't improve on it, &amp; takes the bare-bones of a common experience in all cultures - the rough male hunters with better weapons killing the settled, family-based tribal groups, &amp; turns it into a sappy, unconvincing, feckless exercise in Big Bad Guys &amp; Nice Good Guys.You will enjoy the original - the reality of the story will feel somehow familiar. You may remember playing hide &amp; seek as a child, or simple chasing games, thrilling precisely because they are real. You will admire &amp; appreciate the young man who becomes the Pathfinder in the original - he defines what it means to have greatness thrust upon you. You will like the elder who instructs the young man. You will appreciate the silence of the snow, the forbidding landscape, that everything's made by hand, the view of primitive life that is yet not so different from ours in its simplest elements.The original Pathfinder features dialog in Sammi, &amp; uses exotic looking actors. The village people are fresh, simple. Watching them almost feels like a documentary.The bad guys in the original are very scary - big, strong, dark, relentless. They have lots of big metal swords, they have tough clothing, they have good boots. All those details are done artistically &amp; beautifully. The scariest thing about them is not their "beserker" outlook, emphasized in the remake, but the hard fact that they have planned out the annihilation of their prey dispassionately. You don't simply hate them, you fear their strength of will &amp; their vision of utter destruction.The young hero is as terrified as anyone would be by seeing these cruel &amp; massively powerful killers come closer &amp; closer to his loved ones. How he handles his fear, &amp; what he does to become the Pathfinder, is especially what's missing from the remake.But I'm not going to even talk about this current version since I think it's not worthy of conversation. As an adventure movie, it's just OK, nothing great. But you might want to see Conan the Barbarian instead.Nope, there's nothing remarkable about the new Pathfinder, but if it gets Gaup's film released on DVD, it will have been worth the effort it took to make it.Watch it if you must. But then, Please! Find the original!</fullReview>

Doubtful if they were historically accurate, but when a whole movie is bogus, what difference does it make if the costumes are embellished. The Vikings reminded me of the orcs in Warcraft (the video game series by Blizzard) and the Death Dealer character of the great fantasy artist Frank Frazetta.

There are actually accounts of this: Greenlanders' Saga and The Saga of Erik the Red which tell of the Viking discovery of North America. Greenlanders' Saga describes a voyage made by Bjarni Herjolfsson, the first Norseman to see the shores of North America, and the subsequent voyages of Leif Eriksson, his brother Thorvald, his sister Freydis, and the Icelandic merchant Thorfinn Karlsefni. Oh, yes, horses. Were there already horses in Greenland at that time? Actually, the second voyage to Vinland was made by his brother Thorvald, he did not bring horses, but he did bring cows.

The hero of this film, 'Ghost', just isn't human.The guy challenges a 7 foot tall Viking warrior with years of fighting experience to a broadsword duel, pokes his eye out through a battle helmet, and easily escapes through the circle of warriors. All without a minute of instruction from a master on the proper technique of using this heavy and awkward weapon. Really, now? He gets shot with an arrow, loses tons of blood, yet travels miles to a cave where he is miraculously discovered by his tribe and cured in minutes. Yep, back good as new in the blink of an eye.He kills dozens of hard, strong, experienced Viking warriors (probably some of the best fighters in the world at that time in history) yet never gets tired or seriously injured.He falls in freezing lake water, fully clothed in skins, stays underwater FOREVER and then gets rescued by his captors without any ill effects. I'm here to tell that submersion in freezing water for 60 seconds will render you NON-FUNCTIONAL unless you are superhuman.His female soul mate is an absolute wonder with a rock, dispatching several of these aforementioned Viking warriors easily.I'm sorry, but this type of action film is just too heroic for my tastes.

As a result the Vikings appear almost like mythical monsters whose barbarism and inhuman acts serve as a warning for current and future generations.One only has to look to current and past wars and conflicts to see examples of how enemies both real and perceived are dehumanized as a defense mechanism.Bottom line: A very effective action movie, whose influences are obvious, yet unique in it's own right all wrapped up with some great effects and sometimes breathtaking cinematography.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Based on the Vikings excursion to the "New World" long before Columbus. There is one lone man capable of stopping a Nordic invasion that will wipe out the native American population. Thats about all there is to the story, wanted more? So did I.To start off this movie really did have potential.I went in and really did want to like this. Unfortunately after viewing this I am certain that there was not one redeemable feature in the whole film.The lack of story and explanation really hurts the movie. Your sort of thrown into the middle of a random collection of battle scenes where an amazing amount of heads and other body parts are flung around but your never really told why. Why the Vikings are hellbent on killing every man, woman and child they come across. It is mentioned a couple times that they are there to colonize but not once do you see a Viking woman, child or cow for gods sake. Some little tidbit of information trying to bring some credibility to an empty story. Im sure not more than 2 lines of meaningful dialect is even spoken.And while were on that subject why was the Viking language subtitled and the native American language in English? Not a nagging detail i guess but still bothered me.All the Vikings look alike and are all bloodthirsty killing machines. Not exactly like you read from the history books but what do we know.The visuals were not even the best they could of been, the avalanche scene specifically looks like it was cut from national geographic.Overall if you want a hack and slash movie with no apparent meaning or message this will do but if you want something with a little more meat to it than a movies like 300 and Gladiator will provide a more fulfilling experience.</fullReview>

He's been good in other stuff, too, of course, but I'm kind of waiting for him to get his big break. Pathfinder certainly isn't it. A vague remake of the excellent Norwegian 1987 movie "Ofelas", Pathfinder is the quintessential commercial Hollywood remake. The Samic people are now Native Americans, and the marauders are now monster-like vikings in a kind of horn and skull-adorned armor that would seem to have escaped from one of Richard Wagner's nightmares. And of course the violence and action are now CGI, making for plentiful splattering of blood and mud all over the place. Subtlety is a concept unknown to this production, and one wonders what good actors like Urban, Brown and Bloodgood are doing here.

		<shortDescription>Wonderful Art Direction, but...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>...runs a like over 100 minutes of "prologue" or "highlights", which I wish there was "more" to. There wasn't enough set-up to the characters or the setting for me to "get into" the movie, because that would require more than a series of beautifully framed shots. Even the action sequences suffer from this problem-- whether in choreography or editing, things just happened too "quickly" or "easily" on camera to convey any real sense of "cinema".I understand the whole approach with muted sounds, sepia tones and slow motion, etc., was meant to convey a mythical, dream-like atmosphere, but it meant that I mostly enjoyed looking at it as an animated graphic novel. I would have preferred it as a more detailed, "real-time" action-adventure, but this was still a good-looking movie-- probably done to show-off the art direction more than anything else (like script, stunts or story). I've seen a making-of clip where the director claimed he wanted to push the envelope-- NOT.Although I think it's just a passable "5", I don't understand why some people trashed this movie for being "historical fantasy"-- when they will accept almost any kind of trash sold to them as "science fiction". I suppose there just isn't an established tradition and audience for historical fantasy like the historical wuxia or fantasy fiction/ films in Asia-- where they run amok with history/ reality and just have fun with it.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dances with Vikings - In Slow Motion</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Plot: Some vikings visit America for reasons best known to themselves. During a lovely bit of pillaging and murderlising, a little viking boy is asked to kill a tiny native American baby. Little viking boy politely declines the offer and is thusly disowned by his slightly peeved father. Viking boy grows up to be big, strapping Karl Urban and all goes well until the old norse family turn up uninvited to carry on with the plundering and general mayhem. The entire settlement's populous is summarily destroyed, leaving Karl Urban (named Ghost because of his white skin - a bit racist if you ask me) more than a little vexed. Ghost changes his name to Rambo, and with the aid of a slightly retarded Indian - sorry, native American - a few other slightly narked native Americans and the rather obvious love interest, hack and slash their way through the entire North American viking community. It all ends in a rather contrived avalanche of cliché and testosterone, the bad guys killed, the good guy getting the girl and everyone wondering why it all took so damn long.While not the worst film I've ever seen, this one surely ranks up there as the longest. But not because of the duration (the usual 94 or so minutes), but because of the complete lack of pace and the John Woo-ery of filming absolutely everything but dialogue in slow motion. I'm sure if the film was sped up to normal time, it would only last an hour at most. However, it's not all mickey-taking and grumbles. The one good thing about it was that the vikings looked the business. The argument of whether they actually wore helmets with horns aside, they just looked like right nasty little beggars.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all, Vikings are from Sweden! Norway didn't even gain its independence from Sweden till 1902. Sweden also had predominant control over Finland up until the early 1800's.... there for, Vikings are Swedish (some Danish) and the language spoken by the Vikings is Swedish with "smaland" accent, you could say its Swedish with a souther accent which is where Denmark got their language from. Never the less, this movie has great special effects. Even though it shows the Native Americans "dominating" which is also not very factual... Bottom line this movie would be 10x better if it was more accurate. The appearance of the "Vikings" is far from the truth.. Vikings were covered in thick wool to keep them warm with long blonde hair and beards.. the whole hat with horns crap is a myth and it is said that very rarely would only the captain wear the horns hat, that still did not cover his entire face... If Steven Spielberg would of taken this project on it would have been a great success... not some woodsman director making it up as he goes along..</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Odin Hates This Movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Every once in a while a movie comes along that is so brainless, so utterly moronic in its execution, it makes you wonder how no one stepped back during the filming process to say, "look guys, our movie is dumber than a sack of hammers, maybe we should scrap it." Pathfinder is just such a movie. It's easily one of the worst movies to come out in 2007; no small feat as this year has given us such gems as Epic Movie."Pathfinder" supposedly takes place 1000 years ago, when intrepid Norsemen first discovered North America. Of course, being the bad guys, they immediately start butchering the hapless native peoples, and as fate would have it, they leave behind one of their own (Karl Urban), who is raised by the natives. When the Norseman come back to commit more mindless genocide, he must save his foster people from his own kind. Now where have I seen this story before? Oh, only about 1000 other movies or so.Some people have commented that this movie is "offensive" in its portrayal of Scandinavians. I disagree. I think this movie is far too moronic to rise to the level of being offensive. NOTHING in this movie even approaches anything resembling historical reality. The Vikings here are just mindless, barbaric killing machines; nothing is ever glimpsed or learned of their culture or society. Even worse is their costuming, which makes them look more like The Knights Who Say Ni than anything out of history. Yet, in spite of their ridiculously inaccurate depiction, the filmmakers have the Norsemen speak in Icelandic. Now, modern Icelandic is very close to the Old Norse language, and the fact that the filmmakers knew this shows that they at least know SOMETHING of Norse culture. So why depict them correctly in language, and horrifically wrong in every other aspect? It boggles the mind.And not only that, but the Vikings here are so dumb you wonder how they managed to sail across the ocean in the first place. As an example, while climbing a steep mountain, they decide to chain themselves together for no apparent reason, other than so that if one falls, they all do. In another scene, they decide to stupidly walk across a frozen lake, and inevitably they fall through into the freezing water. Are we honestly expected to believe that these people, who come from a land where mountains and snow are in ample supply, would be so moronic? And it's not just the Vikings who get stereotyped, either. The aboriginals are depicted as woefully pathetic warriors, who need a single white man to save them. Pathetic, simply pathetic.So, historical accuracy is out, but at least the movie is an action-packed, turn-off-your-brain kind of movie, right? Well, Pathfinder fails to meet even this lowly standard. The movie has no real dialog, just the barest necessities of exposition. Even worse are the natives, who speak entirely in aphorisms. What passes for dialog is so unbearably cheesy that it resembles something of 9th grade fan fiction. Karl Urban's past "claws at him?" "There are two wolves in man's heart...?" Honestly, who writes this stuff? Even more laughable is Urban's co-star Moon Bloodgood, whose hilariously out-of-place accent elevates Pathfinder to MST3K fare.And when it comes to action, Pathfinder is even more inept. Action scenes are edited so choppily and haphazardly that it becomes impossible to tell who is doing what to whom. There's just a flash of swords and blades, and then someone ends up dying in a gory fashion. The movie is also graced with a very tenuous grasp on continuity; in one scene, characters are seen moving through a cave, and the next moment scaling a mountain. In one scene, we see a thunderstorm, and in the next scene it's the middle of winter! The absolute low point comes near the end, where Karl Urban triggers an avalanche. We see a few chunks of snow come loose, and then a blatantly obvious stock-footage insert of an avalanche! Pathfinder had the unfortunate fate of being released alongside 300, a vastly superior movie. While 300 was obviously a piece of historical fantasy, at least it tried to keep the essence of who the Spartans were. Pathfinder does none of this.If you want to see better movies about Norse culture, see the 1987 Norwegian film "Pathfinder" which this movie is (very) loosely based upon.</fullReview>

In defense of the actors (who obviously need to get new booking agents) allow me to say this...the director and screenwriter gave the actors unimaginative, clichéd caricatures rather than emotive, depth-filled characters. The actors had nothing to work with, so their work looks weak at best.In defense of the screenwriter...well, given the inane dialog, I really have no defense for the screenwriter - except to say that this was probably picked up as a side project for just enough cash to buy a pound of weed and a fat bag of shrooms.Truthfully, the director and producers are to blame for the asinine waste of celluloid that was Pathfinder. They should be kicked out of the Hair Club of Hollywood, banned from film-making, and whipped in an torturously unpleasant, non-fetish custom for months on end. Then they should have to give us our money back, and pay restitution for emotional and intellectual damages, for we are sadder and dumber for seeing this film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>First of all i cant help but notice how out of all the people who voted it seems its a love hate movie. You ether loved it or hated it. I for one loved it. I mean ya the trailer made it out to be a movie more about the Norse men then anything else but when has a movie followed the adds. Vary rarely in my experience vary rarely. The hole movie is based around a young Norse boy who was left behind after a Norse raid. A native women(not sure what tribe) finds him and adopts him into the tribe. He's isn't excepted into the tribe truly though. Later the Norse come back and he has a chance to prove himself.The movie had a few problems people keep pointing out that i cant seem to figure out myself. I mean ya the scoring wasn't the most memorable thing ever and i wouldn't buy the scoring but I'm fine with the with no scoring like in the old school horror movies which had the most minimal scoring ever. There was nothing wrong with the acting that i noticed but i don't have a major in theater like some people. I mean if you want bad acting thats not the actors fault go watch Bloodrayne. That move had an excellent concept behind it and actors that could back it up, but they got that director who has messed up every movie he's ever made. Pathfinder was fine unless someone wants to nitpick. The only problem the movie had was its release date which was right after 300 which destroyed its box-office scoring. 300 may I point out did excellent even this its inaccuracies. This movie was more accurate then 300 in many ways though the Norse men didn't dress like Space marines(warhammer 40k reference) or Orks from WarCraft but there has to be some artistic license when there making a movie thats not a documentary.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Revisionist history and poor filmcraft collide</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A dim-witted effort which attempts to not only rewrite history, but turn it upside down, as North American Indians and Vikings battle it out in a pre-apocalyptic world. It's as if Terrence Malik directed "Conan The Barbarian," stole bits and pieces from "Last of the Mohicans" and "300" and then solicited advice from Mel Gibson.Now, I like history as much as the next person, but I don't remember the Norsemen taking on Native Americans (maybe I slept through that semester), however, if it happened, fine.My problem is the sum of all the parts adds up to a big bore ? the death knell for a film which features Indians fighting Vikings with enough decapitations to make the Reign of Terror look like a Three Stooges film festival. I actually dozed off for a few minutes (and probably missed the whole point of the picture).Of course, this is no surprise, considering the director, Marcus Nispel, was the man behind the "Texas Chainsaw Massacre" remake (as if we were all clamoring for THAT particular effort). Probably as bad a movie one will see between January and April (the time studios notoriously release their flotsam in preparation for the summer blockbuster and fall awards seasons).Okay, I suppose some sort of a plot detail is necessary here (although I don't know why it really matters). Abandoned by his Norse brethren as a child, Ghost (Karl Urban, "Bourne Supremacy," "Out of the Blue," and who seems clad in a diaper Pebbles Flintstone wouldn't wear), is raised by the peaceful tribe his cousins tried to conquer.Urban, by the way, is perfect for this role, since a Viking brought up by Indians probably doesn't have to say very much, if anything. This role suits his acting skills to a tee. Anyway, learning the ways of the native, however, he's prepared when the long-boatmen come back to finish the job (real Viking fans know, however, they always fade in the second half).Led by Clancy Brown (he was much more frightening as the evil guard in "The Shawshank Redemption"), the Europeans attack without mercy or merit, but will Ghost allow blood to be thicker than bad acting? Don't bet on it.</fullReview>

That is alarming.This movie has no potential, I've seen many Hollywood movies with potential which were ruined with bad acting, typicality, etc but this one over here is one of those movies which has no potential right from the start because by the time the Vikings were traveling to America, there were no Indians living there so there was no actual meeting between the two. Anyway ignoring that fact, I really felt offended by the way the Nordic people were portrayed in this movie, as satanic horned brainless evil racist Nazis who liked to exterminate poor innocent and defenseless Indians just for fun. It was an insult to both Nordic people and Indian people.Also the plot of "one man destroying an entire army" has been really over-used in Hollywood and it's really becoming boring to watch it over and over again under different stories.Do NOT waste your time with this garbage, if you want to see a good viking movie, I strongly recommend you to watch Outlander (2008), The 13th Warrior (1999) and Beowulf (2007).

		<shortDescription>Solidly entertaining mindless historical adventure kicks</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I'm not really a fan of historical adventures, as most seem to me to do little more than weave inaccuracies and racial stereotypes into tedious action. Pathfinder is pretty much the epitome of this style which I dislike, yet I bought it, watched it and enjoyed it enough to not regret the purchase (it was second hand, always a bonus). I remember seeing its trailers back when it first came out and I remember it dropping off the map with remarkable speed, despite being by a young director who seems to be regarded as bankable (Marcus Nispel) and generous helpings of crowd pleasing things like old school heroism, simplistic plotting crazed fighting. I guess the historical adventure is a devalued genre these days, or perhaps people simply didn't like this one, its hard to tell. Anyhoo, Pathfinder gives us the story of a young Viking abandoned as a child to the New World and brought up by American Indians. He goes native and has the sort of experience one would expect of somebody adopted by a pretty much alien people, but proves to be of great assistance when his Viking brethren return with genocide on their minds. No prizes for guessing how it all unfolds, original and innovative plotting is not high on this ones list of interests, what it does do pretty nicely though is mindless and intense battle scenes adorned with bits and pieces of fun bloodletting. Marcus Nispel seems to like tightly edited and closely shot action, something which can really spoil a film (like it did his Friday the 13th effort) but here it works out well enough, the camera catches the rough and ready choreography with fair visual coherence and the editing does a nice job in joining moves and their bloody pay-offs and then stringing a collection of these sequences together. Its an approach that doesn't work so well in the films two bigger scale action scenes but still works out okay, helped out by the lack of shaky cam. Cinematography is generally solid here, coldly forbidding and epic, has an impersonal feel typical of Daniel Pearl's work in these sorts of films but it works well enough, while effects work is quite fun, with the muted tones of fighters contrasting nicely with the more vivid red of the CGI blood. And as for acting, well it does the job. Badassery and a few emotional surges are all the acting required here and the cast pull it off, there is a tiny skein of self realisation lurking in the quieter moments of the film for the cast to briefly chew on, but nothing requiring acting on anything higher than an 80's action hero level. Karl Urban is a decent hulky and laconic hero, Moon Bloodgood an attractive tough cookie as a strong willed Indian lady, Russel Means a convincingly wise elder and the ever badass Clancy Brown as a Viking badass. Altogether it's solid mindless fun, I had a surprisingly fine time with it, there's some fun slaughter and tip top silliness (especially a scene involving sleds), it may be indefensible from a historical point of view and probably offensive as well, but as pure entertainment I reckon it does the job.</fullReview>

Borrowing from the irrefutable evidence of Viking landings in North America, it goes on a quest to invent a story of a Viking boy becoming a native. Only for that boy to find his past again.For much of his life, Ghost is seen as an outsider. But when Vikings land again and try to kill everybody, he must confront them. Some of the Native Americans foolishly take on the invaders, but it is only to their demise.Ghost and the Pathfinder's daughter, Starfire, begin a romantic relationship in the most dire of circumstances. But Ghost leads his former countrymen, the Vikings, to their deaths after they kill his comrades.The action is very well done. Karl Urban, with Moon Bloodgood, make a nice pair in the movie to survive the odds. Plus, the action was well worth watching.I give this a solid grade.

First of all, to those of you complained about the historical inaccuracy, WELCOME TO THE MOVIES. IF you want historical accuracy, watch Gettysburg, or Patton. This movie was designed to be a myth, a legend. It was not marketed as a historical movie, nor does it make any claim anywhere to be a historically accurate film. Second, lets try to remember that this is a set as a legend. Intricate dialog would be out of place in such a setting, not to mention incorrect for the time period (which would no doubt give some people more to grumble about). Third, this movie is an ACTION movie. IT is SUPPOSED to be full of action, NOT lots of character development. In fact, for an action movie, this one has a great deal of character development. Finally, there was NOTHING wrong with the acting. Sometimes we Americans forget that not every culture favors expressing emotion as readily as we do, and this movie is a great example of that. The actors do a fine job with the role they are given. All things considered, a fine movie, and even better when compared with other action counterparts.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Why shy away from it when your only selling point is the violence?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>People who watch only good movies tend to exaggerate how awful a movie is when it is just average. Most film buffs don't see the truly terrible. Sometimes I do. Sometimes I enjoy the pain. Pathfinder is the worst major release of 2007 that I have seen at this point. And there are so many I have thus far avoided, many that looked far worse than this one, judging by their trailers. Honestly, I thought Pathfinder looked like it could be decent. The premise is serviceable: a Native American (well, actually a white guy, but the backstory ain't worth explaining) fights against monstrous Viking intruders. If kept short, this could have been a moderately entertaining B-movie filled with all sorts of gleeful carnage. If one can tolerate such a movie, it can be fun enough. 300 did an okay job of it (just ignore the rampant fascism, if at all possible). But, no, director Nispel fails miserably. Maybe not entirely his fault, though. It feels as if it's been edited for content. Severely edited. Violence is its only selling point, but the film cuts away pretty much any time anything remotely cool is happening. In general, the editing is poor. It's often difficult to tell what's going on. The characters are deadly dull, so I really couldn't care less whether the Norsemen slaughtered the Natives or not. With nothing to hold my attention, I started to drift away. Because, you know, sleep, that's where I'm a Viking.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The worst movie I have ever seen!!! Only pictures are OK, rest is a total crap, the worst thing is a screenplay. The movie is inconsequent from the beginning till end. I cannot even name this crap a 'movie' better thing would be a slide-show with background music and dialogues. First hour is just mega-boring, and when comes to action it's even worse. I really can't understand people who say that this movie is good, is wasn't even entertaining and funny. It was miserable. I thought that the worst movie I've ever seen is "Wiedzmin" (The Witcher), but guess what, "Pathfinder" is much worse!!! OMG this is impossible you will say, but OMG it's true!!! I advise you to watch this crap just to see and understand how bad the movie can be. After one hour of watching you will say that AvP is an Oscar creation. Have fun!!!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Six hundred years before Christopher Columbus landed here.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Our history relates that in 1492 an expedition led by Christopher Columbus "discovered" the new world, which led to its settlement by Europeans, and eventually became what we now know as America. Of course, the Native Americans had discovered it long before that.This movie, "Pathfinder", portrays the "what if" of Vikings coming to North America 600 years before Columbus, and what happened to them? Why were they not able to settle as the Europeans did 600 years later?Karl Urban is the grown up "Ghost", who 15 years earlier had been abandoned there by his Viking father as a young boy too weak and too timid to live up to the Viking lore. Ghost was raised with the Native Americans in his foster family. But he was different and had not yet earned the badge of courage the other natives had.One day, another band of Vikings invaded, seeking to kill all the natives so they could have the land for their own. In this fictional story, Ghost is responsible for gaining the upper hand and eradicating them. The last parts of the movie have some drawn-out scenes in winter mountain battle that seemed a bit too incredulous.Moon Bloodgood is native woman Starfire, who helps Ghost in the mission, and she becomes his wife eventually.I found the movie very interesting, as a story, but in truth it is not a very well made and acted movie. Enjoyable, though.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Let's charge into the spike pits!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>And thus, the Native American's perish into the flames of Hades. Wait, wrong movie right? Well, yes and no. Yes that this movie is awful and no that you shouldn't pay for it, but watch an hour and you can safely say you've 'seen it all'.So check this out for a premise: Icelandic Viking's decide the arctic tundra was no longer fun and decide to invade America and thwart the Native American Indians for no real reason. I have a reason, I believe they are against reservation casino's, but that's another story.So can anyone say Lord of the Ring's Lite? Or how about Diet LotR? It's got all the elements: a viking that looks like a dwarf, black riders, a man who looks an awful lot like Aragon, but with such a mean spirited face that really you'd think he was a Goth chicks wet dream. I mean, Aragon looked sort of kind and nice, this guy, named "Ghost", looks like a pile of fried eggs caught in a blender while being whacked repeatedly with the ugly-Betty stick.OK, I'm not explaining anything about this movie. But whats to explain? Vikings kill Native American's. It's common laws of world government. They are mortal foes like cats and dogs; and fox television against good taste! It's never explained why the Viking's are killing the Indians...I was hoping for some secret doomsday device to be uncovered under the sweat lodge but it turns out that these Indians are utterly defenseless.Seriously, they fight with bow and arrow against Viking's that fight with razor sharp swords. It's comical when Ghost tells the red man that their weapons are null against the VIkings, yet they still decide to charge and give it an all. Sad part is, they charge into a pit of spikes, killing the entire tribe in one fell swoop. I was waiting for the entire Viking horde to laugh in riot, but being the professionals they are, they instead decided to hack the helpless Indians who are desperately scrambling to avoid impalement.Dialog is non-existent, that's why I'm not quoting any. A few words from the script I do remember are: "Hit me" and "Viking's are not cowards!" That last little gem deserves special mention because these Vikings, who grew up in the land of ice and snow decide that super thin is probably a good path to trot, if not for themselves, but for their hundreds of horses and heavy equipment. But, let's test the ice first! So they send the unarmored and probably lightest member, the newly capture Ghost, to walk the ice. Even under his dainty light feet the ice crackles angrily, but showing the Viking's he can unsurely walk five feet forward is all the convincing they need that it's safe. So yeah, that incident, shown in great detail to provide enough time for 'I told you sos' wipes out nearly half the Viking's army against any armies natural worst enemy - thin ice! This movie is horrible, it barely tries and the only one earning his paycheck was the DP, but even then he was just copying Peter Jackson's cue done a few years earlier and about a gazillion times better.Oh, and the pathfinder is an old Indian chief or medicine man or whatever that smokes some moss before getting ripped apart. Great title.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>... when you see this flick in a video store, which should be something like 'Well maybe this isn't the best plot but there might be some good action to see, it's Sunday evening, why not ...' Just turn around and walk away. Quick.When a friend of mine chose the movie to watch I was highly skeptical. And within the first 5 minutes of the film, I knew I was right to be so. Read the previous posts for all the shortfalls the filmmakers created including a lame plot, poor acting, very bad editing and so on. And go see 'Apocalypto' if you're interested in such kind of plots.But what makes this movie nearly impossible to watch for me is the hole style of cinematography the film was shot in. What might look nice on the cover is a pain in the a*** to watch. Almost the entire movie is shot with an annoying amount of back-light to every scene. You can't hardly tell what's actually going on in the foreground in every single take. Combined with the ridiculous editing even the fight scenes are wasted. Oh yeah the fight scenes... they're entirely shot in slow-motion. Probably that's the reason why the editing went out of control trying to add some pace to the action... which failed big time!In my opinion it seems that neither the creators wanted to make an aspired blockbuster nor an intentional B-movie. It is neither controversial nor fun to watch. They just made a movie that's not worth to mention ever again. It's pure waste. I can only guess that the producers needed a good opportunity to depreciate some money.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>OK people. Its simple.This is not the best action flick, however it is original. Unlike the Conan series which surprisingly enough is unbelievable, since the whole sword and sorcery thing springing up, but what about the good old fashioned sword fight.This movie is a good watch. Not the best, but don't expect wonders from films these days, you will get a diamond in the rough occasionally, but on the whole it was a fun move to watch. The fighting/action sequences were excellent. I mean going down a huge hill on the back of a shield with the vikings chasing him on their viking made sled, that was pure genius.The only problem I did have with it, sometimes when there's a lot of action, it jumps around too quick, your not quite sure what you are seeing, but hey, on the whole, a good movie. Well worth the watch unless your gonna criticize anything and everything that you see. Its a movie, you pay to be entertained, not to pick faults. Sit down, watch it, don't expect anything that will blow your mind away, but just enjoy it for what it is, a good action viking, hack n slash flick</fullReview>

Yeah, I know its a Conan-type of a movie, but pleeze - bring at least some new ideas. Everything is a rip-off: from costumes (so highlander/LOTR) to landscape shots. There is nothing original in this movie, not even a single minute of the footage. The stupidest moment is the dumb-ass sled chase scene ... i mean c'mooon people. They even got Clancy Brown(The Kurgan from original Highlander movie) to play the main Viking, and speaks in some language that's suppose to sound like Norvegian, but its just pathetically weak. On the other hand, native Americans speak such a fluent English ... this is such an embarrassing movie. In my opinion, this is not even a rental-worth - this is strictly a download movie, and when u do download it, watch it it fast-forward.</fullReview>

I believe you should all watch a film and judge for yourself. With this film however, I feel i should save you the time you would waste on it. As my summary suggests this film is for want of a better word "CRAP". Karl Urban was a good baddie in the "Chronicles of Riddick" but sucked in "DOOM". This guy already has the stereotypical brooding image and so he will always be cast in a role with few words which is just as well coz he cant act for S**t. All in all this film is dark, moody, gory and that is it. 100 mins of bad acting, bad scripting and very bad lighting,it even looked like a cam-like rip off for a while it was so bad. There is even a 2-3 minute sex scene with our hero and the local totty which was sooo out of place it was slightly embarrassing to watch. All in all not a good film by a long way, Most of the actors involved will be hiding there faces all the way to the bank, and if there not they should be.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Such a disappointment.There we were,looking forward to a new film portraying a little understood episode in Norse history and what we got was an anachronistic, fictitious disaster that is an insult to both Viking and Native American cultures.We looked for redeeming factors. Really, we did. But even the charms of a half naked Karl Urban or the serious efforts of an almost unrecognisable Clancy Brown were not enough to salvage what could have been an historical epic if handled properly.Don't mis-understand me, we weren't expecting a documentary presentation of history, but what we have is so far off the mark it would be funny if not for the sad fact that hundreds of people out there have a tendency to believe everything the silver screen throws at them. (Look at the amount of people who treat Braveheart as gospel.) Yes the fight scenes are good. War is not pretty. There are plenty of mutilations and buckets of blood to keep even the most hardened of us horror fans entertained. But towards the middle of the film it's becoming gratuitous, and by the end predictably boring. The script is bad (Karl Urban enjoyed the Conan approach to learning scripts as it takes him about half an hour to open his mouth.) The editing is bad. The photography is bad. And as for the costumes, well think of every inaccurate stereotype and multiply by ten.Even if treated as pure fantasy, it's poor.Simply awful.</fullReview>

The costuming is imaginative if not historically accurate. The action was designed for a brutal American audience and will probably not be in theaters long.(We get enough of this fare in the news these days ). The acting is good enough and Carl Urban has the look. Not getting a Native girl for the lead smacks of the old days when Italians played Indians. A flashback, maybe. Russel Means probably needs the frogskins. Obviously, Conan the Barbarianisms are seen through out.

		<fullReview>My biggest problem with the movie is that the preview is way to good and tricks you into thinking the movie might actually have some substance. I figured, although this storyline has been done, the whole "viking raised by Indian's and now vikings come back to kick Indian's ass but little viking is grown up and whoops the crap out of the other vikings" sounded like something i wouldn't mind paying 10 bucks for. Now I'll never get that hour and a half of my life back and I'm not too pleased about it. I myself know nothing of movies and i can even enjoy i good Arnold movie but pathfinder should just be illegal. Most bad movies you can tell the whole time but this one lures you in with a cool concept and screws you over with everything else. From the first scene i knew id made i mistake because throughout the whole movie you can never tell what the hell is going on, i spent the whole time wondering if i was just retarded or if i was having seizure. None of the battles make sense because nothing happens...its a jumble of swords flying and at the end of it the vikings are all dead and Karl urban is just standing there, its like the director thought if he confused you enough he wouldn't actually have to take the time to make a legitimate battle scene. I don't even really want to talk about the dialog cause there were parts of that movie that made Bruce Lee movies look like Linguistic masterpieces. I cant understand that lines like "I will find there leader and bring back his head...followed by random Indian cry"(meanwhile Indian whose saying this looks like someone has got a gun to his head) got past so many people involved in this movie. It seriously looks like a bad school play...I'm surprised the vikings didn't wave to there mommy when they got on camera...and on top of everything else i think a couple other people said it best about the editing...although i think its an insult to blind peoples credibility to think they'd let something this abysmal meet there visual criteria...just cause they cant see doesn't mean they cant smell crap.Basically I'm just angry cause the preview looked so cool and the movie tanked so bad...i think that director should be shot and along with him...the writer...and the editor...and every actor except Karl urban...well maybe shoot him in the arm or something just cause he wanted to be a part of this train wreck...One more thing...when in his 15 years of being an Indian did this guy learn to use a sword...no one taught him...yeah he could swing it really cool in the woods but how did he learn to kill 100 vikings with it...i dunno why I'm still talking about this...the director is probably laughing at me right now for putting more effort into this comment than he did in the entire film...</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Awful Waste of Good Landscape</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Where to start... This movie is full of clichés, from the classic "finding yourself" or "facing your past demons", but this only added to the pain i was being put through. It felt like i was watching the Last Samurai, which wasn't that bad in my opinion, and looked good visually. The reason i say this is...in Samurai... The main character is scrutinized by his party of origin, he is then brought in to the enemy, and lives with the enemy for years, he becomes one of them, and then in the end, gloriously fights back against his origins, not completely winning but...making an impact. Alright, now take the same plot build up...and insert Vikings as the origin, and native Americans as the "enemy", get the point? Alright, lets move on, the casting for this movie was terrible, Karl Urban is so cheesy, not to mention half the natives are played by pacific islanders or Latinos, maybe Apocalypto has spoiled me by having REAL Natives play the part of Natives. OK, now lets look at historical accuracy, the Natives completely over powered the Vikings in real history, sure the Vikings might have killed their share, but in violent conflicts, the Norsemen meet serious resistance, and it is not the complete Norse Domination that Pathfinder sets it as. Not to mention in real history, there are many interesting facts one could read up on about the Vinland colonization, but ill save that for a different time. The ONLY and i repeat ONLY reason I didn't give this movie a 1 is for the landscape, the backgrounds throughout the movie just look cool as hell, also, the costume design is pretty sweet. In terms of an Action movie, its terrible, who directed this? ever heard of a widescreen angle? Every time there is a fight, the camera zooms in to the faces and weapons and spins and transitions wildly so all you hear is a blade clash and then you see the after effect, but hey, maybe Tarantino and Rodriguez have set my standards high, or too high for Pathfinder at least. What a waste of an original idea and setting, this movie could've been great if done from a different perspective, and lacking all of the corny lines and disgusting dialog, not to mention the unreal strength given to "Ghost" in his ability to slaughter countless dumb Vikings.</fullReview>

This was supposed to be an action movie, but it was so poorly cut together, I couldn't tell what was going on or who was fighting who? It was like watching a naughty channel when you don't actually have the channel and you can't tell a boob from an elbow. As for the story, there is almost no explanation as to what is happening or why. Stuff just happens, and one scene doesn't necessarily go with the previous, as in, people and objects just appear out of nowhere. I guess the filmmakers expect the audience to use our imagination to fill in the blanks. It would have been a better movie if they cut the beginning and the end together and I imagined the entire movie. If you're looking for Viking action, play Rune instead.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>It is hard not to be sitting in the theater and not try to compare this movie with Conan the Barbarian. At the time, with no CGI, a barbarian world seemed believable and, mind you, the characters had flesh, bone and heart, you cared for them. The saddest thing about Pathfinder is that you don't feel anything for the characters. They are portrayed in such a cardboard fashion that it makes you wonder how most of the native Americans that act in this movie did not raised concern about their portrayal. The story was so disarticulated that I heard a couple of comments in the audience, "I don't understand". The story lacks in density and truth. Never are we presented with reasonable reasons to believe any bond, or lack of, of any of the relationships between the characters.It is easy to blame the editing but I do believe that the editor was extremely limited by the material at hand. The fight scenes are incomplete in their coverage. There is no variety in camera angles and most of it seemed a repeat of shot after shot. Photography and wardrobe were good although the Digital Intermediate correction degraded the possibility of a visual feast. The best way to describe this movie is "inconsistent". I have walked out of a movie before, Masters of the Universe...I almost walked out of this one but still had a few handful of popcorn and a lot of soda to waste so I stayed.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fails in comparison</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I thought the trailer was good, and the posters are definitely conspicuous enough-make you wanna see the movie and all. With the recent success and great cinematography from Apocalypto and 300, I thought this movie would've been on par. The problem is, it wasn't. It failed miserably compared to the two movies mentioned, which this movie has so many 'similar traits' from, by the way. I'm not saying that Pathfinder is a rip-off, but any average movie goer who have both seen Apocalypto and 300 would not really find it hard to bring up the comparison. The climax is similar to the former and the action sequences is similar to the latter. But on both accounts, this movie failed miserably to compare. The action sequences were so hard to keep track since the cinematography is just too poor. I don't know if this is really done by someone who has experience in doing this kind of films, but I felt it was done by an amateur. I can't understand what was hit, or who has hit, for that matter. It was just utterly confusing. There were even some scenes that they like to focus on more 'artful' scenarios, pulling a 300-ish type of slow motion and focusing, but it was just bland and ineffective. It certainly didn't help the scenes.For the acting, well, Karl Urban did a decent job. I mean, he has to pull off some facial expressions due to the lack of lines. But above average? No. Thank god for CG that saved this whole movie. The acting, the banal story, the uneventful release here in my country after 300 and Apocalypto-I'd say that this movie is just not worth your money and your time. Disappointing.P.S. I've never had more hatred than Moon's character. I mean, she followed Ghost (Karl Urban) without being asked, and when she was captured and treated like trash, she had the guts to throw a tantrum on him. Major PMS much? What a bitchy character. He should've left her in the cliffs.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Of all the negative adjectives and phrases in the English language I can muster at the moment (Awful, terrible, Whoppie Goldberg), none quite describe just how horrible pathfinder was. It wasn't even the standard 'This movie was lacking in this way: ...' bad, it flat out failed in every way I've tried to wrap my head around it.1) It had no character development. The dialog was BEYOND horrible, not a single line in the movie had any substance or meaning, for Christ's sake the Indian chick had an American accent.2) The cinematography was bad, sometimes just downright horrid. I'd trust a dog-mounted camera to capture the fight sequences better, because my dog might actually sit there for a few seconds and let me figure out what's going on, instead of constantly zooming in and out with cuts to the point where everyone is lost. You couldn't tell what was going on during a fight scene, constant cuts made it impossible to follow the action. So with no action and no dialog, you're COMPLETELY lost the entire movie.3) There were so many moments of stupidity it really astounded me. Vikings wouldn't walk on ice, Indians wouldn't just charge in like artards and fall in ghosts trap (Thanks to the credits I know what his name is, didn't catch it THE ENTIRE MOVIE in the dialog), and for the love of god WHY did they tie themselves together on top of the mountain? The SECOND they did that I said to my friend 'WHAT ARE THEY DOING? NOW IF ONE FALLS THEY ALL FALL, WTF???'. 5 minutes later they were all falling off the cliff. He speaks fluent viking/Norse/whatever after 15~ish years away from them? I took 4 years of Spanish in high school, 2 years ago and I can barely form a sentence. I have friends who were fluent in their native languages 5 years ago and have completely lost everything they knew because they never use it. I'm supposed to believe this guy both learns the Indians language AND maintains perfect viking speak?4) How were they even vikings? It looked like someone took a Knight out of any video game ever made, took away the horses (on some of them), and put them in a movie with Indians. Hey, this'll be fun! I can see it now, Pathfinder 2: Trail of Tears (Tears of the people leaving the theater in shock that they payed 7 dollars to see the second one, trails leading right to the refund line).I mean really, it didn't even try to be good. In any way. If anything good came out of this, maybe it convinced someone that if a movie that terrible can be made and gross profit, anyone can do it, and someone got the courage to pursue a career in film.</fullReview>

The story on the other part is poor, the action scenes are good, but made somehow in a hurry and not so many, some of the footage didn't belong there, like the avalanche.The atmosphere reminds me of "The 13th Warrior (1999)" but at a smaller scale.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Okay, so I gave it a two. That is only because there was an attempt made to make the battle scenes exciting. That was it.This movie seemed to be an attempt to gather the best of some really good films and lump them together in a feeble try to make a blockbuster. Most notably "300" and "Conan The Barbarian". The movie is factually inaccurate on almost every level. Not to mention I found it extremely funny that while the Indian's were able to speak perfect English, slang included, the so called Vikings had to be sub-titled.At one critical moment in the film, critical only because my eyes were open at that time.....the lead character "Ghost" is asked whether the location chosen for their stand against the barbarians is a good one...is response is..."Yeah". Powerful! What writing!There is a moment where a young Indian girl is being chased through the woods by the barbarians, and at one point she pauses and turns to see her pursuers and gives almost the same exact look at you see from Macauly Caulkin in "Home Alone"....same scream, same look on her face, all that was missing was for her to slap her cheeks as she yelled.Swords floated gingerly down to the bottom of a lake....A wise Indian proverb is uttered...something to the effect that the only battle in a mans heart is between Love and Hate.What else to say? This movie had the potential to be a wonderful epic had they spent a lot more time on the writing, direction, music, and story in general.I wouldn't waste the cost of a Netflix transaction on it. You will come away with a blackout in time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I don't go to the theater very often and, when I do, it is usually to see a romantic comedy. My sister and I planned an all day shopping spree, complete with lunch and a movie. As there were no romantic comedies to choose from, I chose to see Pathfinder. I thought that the idea of vikings and Indians sounded pretty good. Yes, the idea was good. Unfortunately, I do not care to see heads chopped off and people brutally tortured and killed. I could only watch about 15 minutes of the whole film. The rest of the time, my eyes were looking at the side wall of the theater, as killings were taking place. I guess I watch too many old movies at home where your imagination takes the place of vivid slaughter on the screen. My sister, who goes to the movies quite often, told me that this is the way most movies are today. Next time my sister and I go out, I'll skip the movie and do more shopping.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>This movie was very inspiring</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie really inspired me to find whoever made this movie and kill them. Let me just lay out what you need to know about this movie. An Indian woman stumbles upon a young viking child who was abandoned by his dad for not killing some Indian children. As he grows older, he somehow becomes an excellent swordsman while the rest of the Indians don't know what a sword is. Then, after the vikings return to kill his tribe, he decides that he is going to "kill as many of them as he can"..."there will be no afterwards". Yeah he wants to be some sort of honorable martyr. Then he kills many vikings and they chase him... he sleds down a mountain on his shield while his pursuers kill themselves on trees... he hides underwater and ambushes people... the chief Indian kills a bear and then gets high... he picks up a mute friend at some point who serves no purpose in the story except dying... there is a side-romance that leads you to believe that viking boy is going to learn some lesson about love/hate... the opposite happens... the old Indian gives him advice about not having a vengeful heart... he gets stretched to death... many dark, choppy, action scenes later and a lot of people sacrificing themselves to viking boy and a mass Indian suicide, there is an avalanche that kills everyone... except of course for viking boy. Then for some reason, his Indian girlfriend becomes the "Pathfinder"... whatever that means.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst Movie Ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Probably the biggest offense this movie commits isn't the plot or horrible screenplay but the lack of a good choreographed fight scene. The director shows his laziness by zooming into the action and shaking up the camera, then bam, someone's dead. The "strong and brutal violence" could've been this movie's only saving grace but it even failed to deliver on that. True, heads fly and roll but they seem totally out of context with the body they became detached from. What we're left with is a confusing, hard to watch, neutered movie where the audience doesn't care who dies or lives. In the final "battle" scene, when Ghost was slowly leading the vikings across a narrow mountain ledge, I couldn't help but feel the metaphor of the director taking us on the same tedious, precarious journey through inanity.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>To quote Grindhouse, If you are thinking about seeing this movie, DON'T! Not only is the acting sub-par, but the movie is just plain ridiculous. Don't waste your money, go see Grindhouse instead. The movie is full of no name actors, the film style gets very difficult at times to follow, leaving you wondering who just hit who is fights, and there is a scene where Vikings are following the main character down a snow covered mountain on sleds. People walked out 30 minutes into the film, and everyone else should have followed. By the end of the movie everyone in the theater was mocking the film together.Do Not See This Movie.Seriously.That is all.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Totally disappointing</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Pathfinder was hyped as an epic film but was an utter disappointment. It has my nomination for worst film of 2007 - The editing was inconsistent, the acting average, the story a mess with large holes in the story.The film it feels like the cinematography and editing styles were changed repeatedly and maintain no consistency throughout. The scenery often changes in seconds from muddy forests to snowy plains and back again leaving you wondering whether the editing was by three people who refused to work together.Lead actor Karl Urban, after his last effort in Doom, has only a few chances to make good on a promising start to his main-stream film career. This film will do his career no favors and I totally agree with the comments made in Pete Simone's review here.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>worse piece of crap ever</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>No plot 2. No character development (I don't think Carl Urban made one facial expression. He has four lines.) 3. No emotion 4. Nonsensical violence (the movie is just an expression of poor Hollywood tricks) 5. Computer animated blood 6. Um, lets see, the camera was out of focus 7. 600 years before Columbus...no one in America had seen a horse ...keep that in mind movie makers 8. oh, and how's sledding down a mountain on your shield for a good 15 minutes while effectively not being shot with arrows and steering under every single fallen log? Way cool. 9. Or killing off everyone in your village twice because once wasn't enough and you really want to be like Gibson's Apocalypto 10. No. The best thing is falling off a mountain and surviving. Nothing beats that.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Lame remake of classic story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is not good. It's the good thing that operator work can be interesting - a lot of gloomy but impressive locations. There were some action with swordplay - but they were too short.The only breathtaking surprise was when Indians perished in friendly trap...The rest is a waste of time. Basically plot is OK, but details spoils everything. Who recommended to mounts vikings on horses? How these horses (in great numbers) managed to survive ocean trip on just 3 boats? As I remember there were no horses on Iceland...Why vikings are displayed as pure evil killing machines with the only goal to eliminate everything on sight? I would like to read some feedback from North Europe countries :)</fullReview>

		<fullReview>What a joke- this movie has neither an interesting plot nor good acting (although you can't really blame the actors on this one)I can understand that Hollywood wants the Vikings to be gruesome etc, but this is ridiculous. They look like something out of the Willow-movie!And the fact that one man takes on like 30 vikings and drops them like flies..yeah... The movie has some pretty decent action-scenes, but it's filmed so dark that you can hardly make out what's really going on.I have to add the fact that I like pure action like the Conan movies etc, but this movie doesn't even come close to that!!!DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS MOVIE</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Horrible movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Most of it made no sense. The vikings were one dimensional with no motive for doing anything, nor any consequence, good or bad. The thing that annoyed me the most is that the viking child at the beginning had blond hair and blue eyes. The chief even pointed this out in a scene. However, Karl Urban has very dark, almost black eyes, and very dark hair. He almost looks like the Indians. My husband and I went to see it today and we both have placed it on our list of worst films. And I like Karl Urban, but this movie is awful.There seemed to just be hack and slash with no plot. Was there a plot? If so, I couldn't find it. There was also no visual texture. Every scene looked the same, in a hazy blue filter with nothing to stimulate the eye, except some blood splatter.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Good action, REAL Nordic language, bad research</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>What I really liked about the movie was that the vikings actually spoke old Nordic, which is an old-fashioned version of Icelandic, which was spoken in the western parts of Skandinavia in the past. This makes the movie interesting for people who actually study Scandinavian languages. A big mistake were the clothes the vikings were wearing: in the movie they had horns on their helmets, however, vikings did NOT wear horns on their helmets in reality! This is a common mistake made in movies. VIKINGS DID NOT WEAR HORNS ON THEIR HELMETS! THEY NEVER DID! Some archaeologists made that up when they found an old Viking-helmet with a drinking horn next to it. As for the story: it's packed with nice action, however I can't understand that the Vikings were so violent and dumb. They were explorers, fishers and traders, not the violent warriors like in the movie.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I need a Pathfinder to lead me out of the cinema...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Seriously, the moment the movie started, i knew that this'll be a really long boring film, I felt like walking out. So basically, the plot is that Karl Urban is a viking son that was raised by Native Americans. Years later, the vikings invade the tribes, and now Urban must fight his own kind. I bet you fell asleep reading this. The action is slow and DARK, i mean DARK by you can't see a damn thing. And it looks like they used archive footage for avalanches. Don't see this film. PLEASE! A horrible movie, dark visuals, slow action, lame acting, and tasteless storyline, make up Pathfinder. Urban was better in Doom actually, but that movie sucked too. Don't See this film! It's a waste of time, worst film of 2007. 1 of 10</fullReview>

		<fullReview>really this title is a lost of time in life. I love cinema, and i thought that there aren't bad movies in cinema but movies that one don't like. However, this movie is really, really lame. Since the start, there are scenes that are not concluded and there were left floating in the air. The acting is really boring, the storyline NEVER started. The dialogs, what can i say about them, i could sleep between each line. In many parts, there were scenes that could premedit future scenes. i dunno why people like this movie. There could be a change in the Indian-viking language to be more realistic. Sry my bad English.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One fact remains about viking history, it's rich both in historical facts and legend.I really don't understand why the viking culture is rarely explored in movie-making. Instead, they have chosen to arrange a ridiculous plot to another poor movie.Karl Urban is a good choice for a viking face. He has the looks, the build and strong character to portray the warrior-type. Unfortunately he's lost in this movie.A viking defending the local indians from vikings? Ridiculous.Maybe that's the reason why he doesn't have a proper beard, like any viking was proud to have, he became more of an Indian than of a viking warrior? Don't mock the fighting capabilities and experience of a viking warrior, this guys bowed to no one and were deadly in combat.To put them face to face with indians, being killed one by one by a former viking is both dishonorable both to the Indian culture and the Viking culture.Perhaps the upcoming "Beowulf" (CGI based) will compensate this kind of rubbish, i doubt it though.</fullReview>
