		<shortDescription>Football Fairy Tale</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I too was surprised that this film received a not-much-better than average rating. I am not a huge fan of Beatty, but I think he plays his role in this movie perfectly, running rampant through the lives of his unfaithful wife and private secretary (Charles Grodin couldn't be better), and his former coach. Joe Pendleton is so sweet and earnest that he deserve a happy, fairy-tale ending. I don't think the script ever descends into sappiness and there is a fine ensemble cast. I laugh out loud still, even though I have seen the movie several times, and I still get a bit teary-eyed at the end. This film deserves better!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very classy movie</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I couldn't think of any other way to describe it in the summary - so I used the word "classy". That's right, classy. It probably stems from the fact that the movie is done in such good taste - very appealing and witty humor.The entire cast does an absolutely perfect job in this movie. From Warren Beatty, to James Mason (is James Mason physically capable of putting in a bad performance ? ), to Buck Henry, to Jack Warden. Perhaps the two best performances are Charles Grodin (the slimy personal assistant to Leo Farnsworth),and Dyan Cannon as the psycho Julia Farnsworth. They are both brilliant in their roles.Very worth watching. Also worth more than its IMDB 6.9 rating.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>6.8 User Rating? Huh?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I just about fell out of my chair when I saw that this film only got a 6.8. This is a light entertainment classic and Beatty has never been better suited for a role. The dream supporting cast includes Dyan Cannon, Jack Warden, James Mason, Buck Henry, Charles Grodin, Vincent Gardenia ... and all are at the top of their game. Julie Christie's character (as the love interest) seems, at first glance, to be a bit underwritten, but her scenes with Beatty linger in the memory - especially the ending where Beatty, in a new body with his memory wiped out, sees this beautiful woman in the bowels of a deserted football stadium and struggles to remember what she meant to him.Growing up, I seem to recall that CBS or some major network used to show this once every year and it was hyped as a big event (this was just before the explosion of cable). I never got tired of watching it each year and it still holds up remarkably well.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Thoroughly charming afterlife comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After appearing the rare Mike Nichols misstep THE FORTUNE (1975), it took Beatty three long years to return to the screen with the genteel comedy/fantasy HEAVEN CAN WAIT (1978). In addition to essaying the lead role, Beatty also made his debut in the director's chair, with the assistance of legendary comedy writer Buck Henry (who also plays a supporting role in the film). A remake of 1941 semi-classic HERE COMES MR. JORDAN, HEAVEN CAN WAIT may not surpass the delightful whimsy of the original classic, but it emerges as somewhat of a modern classic in it's own right. The film was an instant hit with both critics and audiences, was nominated for an astounding 9 Oscars including "Best Picture," and remains a magical film that is almost impossible not to love.Beatty not only proves himself to be a perfectly competent film director, and the picture also provides the star with one of his best roles as an actor. Beatty's good-natured football player Joe is the exact type of lovable stud that you cannot help but fall for. The film's screenplay takes Joe from earth to heaven and to back to earth again through an assortment of various bodies, and Beatty's easygoing charisma holds it all together and keeps viewers involved in the story and fixated on the screen. This is a star performance if there ever was one, and Beatty has rarely been more likable.The rest of the cast is particularly winning. The still silver-tongued James Mason (in a part originally offered to the retired Cary Grant) as the heavenly Mr. Jordan and the endearing gruff Jack Warden are perfect as father figure-types for Beatty's Joe, and Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon are absolutely terrific as the film's pair of villains. The only performer missing the boat is a blah Julie Christie, who is pleasant but unconvincing in the sadly underwritten role of the ecologist love interest of the body Beatty has temporarily inherited. It seems as though the creators thought dressing Christie in frumpy wardrobe and frizzy hairstyle was enough to give the character depth, but all they succeeded in was making a natural beauty look rather hideous.The film is a joyous, comedic piece of whimsy that manages to incorporate slapstick comedy, romance, fantasy, and even an underdog sports story without ever feeling bloated or disjointed. The true emotional highpoint comes with Mr. Jordan's farewell to Joe, as well as Max failing to recognize him in his new body. The rather shallow development of Christie's character leaves the film's THE WAY WE WERE-like finale ringing a bit hollow, but it's still an effectively bittersweet coda nonetheless. This film launched a major revival of whimsical comedies that remained popular until the late-eighties, and it easily remains the best effort of this revival.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>6.9 is not a terrible score on here, but for a movie of this quality it is a shame. I very rarely have given a film a 9 and it is very unusual for me to give a higher than average score. This was my favorite movie when I was a kid and when I saw it again recently I was just as impressed as an adult. The cast was excellent and they managed to evoke much emotion out of a fairy tale like story. One of the few remakes worthy of discussion. I would consider this a must see for anyone who has any kind of feelings whatsoever.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I remember as a kid, I loved this movie. I had seen it in the theatre and liked it so much I saw it again! I think the appeal here is the same as in many of these types of films-it's a sweet whimsical fairytale of a movie that is pure entertainment but manages to be lovely without being corny at the same time. There aren't to many movies like this around now. Of coarse, not having seen this since I was a child who knows whether I'd still be such a fan but at that time, I wept buckets and since it was one of the first films that I saw that stuck with me, I have fond memories of it.People shouldn't put this movie down for realism or not having realism etc. It's a fantasy type movie. It's the type of movie you know your wtavhing a movie while you watch it but you cry anyway! I don't think this movie can be dismissed as being lightweight or unimportant. Where would film be without romance? This is up there in that category and many I know feel the same. It's a breath of fresh air and should be seen by anyone who likes warm sentimental (yeah OK sappy!!) movies!</fullReview>

He also wrote The Graduate, by the way, and there are gentle subversive moments in this film as well. I won't spoil them for you, just watch for yourself. Warren Beaty has never been so charming, and that's saying a lot, and Jack Warden just about walks away with the film. Forget GHOST, go right to HEAVEN CAN WAIT. You won't be sorry.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Los Angeles: The City of Angels...And at One Time Rams.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Enjoyable "It's a Wonderful Life"-styled remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", a memorable and sometimes forgotten production from 1941. An over-zealous angel (Buck Henry) takes the quarterback of the Los Angeles Rams (Oscar-nominee Warren Beatty) before his time. Naturally the body is cremated and Henry has to find Beatty another one. Beatty is then re-incarnated as a recently murdered billionaire. This development confuses the billionaire's two-timing wife (Oscar-nominee Dyan Cannon) and accountant (Charles Grodin, also Cannon's lover). Beatty promptly purchases his former team and makes himself the quarterback with aspirations of leading his club to the Super Bowl and winning it. Also along for the ride is the love interest (the always excellent Julie Christie) and the hard-nosed head trainer (priceless Oscar-nominee Jack Warden). "Heaven Can Wait" is a film that teaches about love, compassion, friendship and good moral values. Co-writer/co-director Beatty (nominated in both categories) is the primary catalyst here. His ability as a film-maker raises the movie to a near classic level. Admittedly the production never does quite reach the greatness of films of the type from the 1940s, but still ends up being one of the major winners from the 1970s. Co-star Henry shared a directing nomination with Beatty. Is it just me or do you miss having the Rams in Los Angeles? 4.5 out of 5 stars.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Classic-Style Old-Fashioned Fantasy Film-making Reminiscent of the 1940's and 1950's</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Although made in the very late 1970's, "Heaven Can Wait" is really a throwback to a bygone era of fantasy film-making. Hollywood offerings such as "The Bishop's Wife" (where Carey Grant plays an angel), "Angels in the Outfield", "It's a Wonderful Life", and "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (which is actually the inspiration behind "Heaven Can Wait") were innocent 100-minute escapist fair whose only mission was to entertain. Some modern offerings include "Mr Destiny", "Maid to Order", and the TV shows "The Flying Nun" and "Touched by an Angel". None of these kinds of films have much in the way of cutting social commentary or even ground-breaking cinematic techniques. However, their entertainment value is very high, being nothing but. "Heaven Can Wait" is this kind of a movie, maybe the perfect "chick flick" as it combines fantasy, football and even a little love story.The story is relatively simple: Joe Pendleton (Warren Beatty), a quarterback in the twilight of his career, feels destined to make it to the Superbowl. The LA Rams, his team, are in the playoffs. One day during early-morning training after consuming his liver-and-whey shake, he bicycles into a tunnel where two large vehicles taking both lanes are charging from the other direction of the tunnel. Looks like Pendleton will be playing in a Superbowl coached by Vince Lombardi with George "The Gipper" Gipp as one of his teammates. The next thing he knows, he's jogging among clouds with an escort (played by writer-director Buck Henry who also played the hotel attendant in "The Graduate") in a suit and tie trying to get him to stop running around. Pendleton is still in his athletic clothes sporting a soprano saxophone and doing push-ups among the fluffy billows. He doesn't quite realize he's died. Or has he? Turns out the escort made a mistake: Pendleton would have survived, perhaps avoided, the collision, but the escort nabbed him from his body before the resolution of the event, relying on "probability and outcome", a recurring theme of the movie. Pendleton was not due for many decades.His case is taken up by Mr Jordan (James Mason in one of his later roles) a kind of heavenly supervisor who apparently coordinates peoples' souls. Realizing the mistake, Jordan takes Pendleton back to earth to find him a new body so he can live out the rest of his life as he was meant to. The only one available is the body of millionaire Leo Farnsworth who has just been murdered care of his estranged wife and personal assistant, played brilliantly by Dyan Cannon and Charles Grodin. One of the best scenes is when Pendleton reappears as Farnsworth, and Cannon nearly has a conniption. Pendleton, now as stuffy gazillionaire Farnsworth, must forge a way to get back to the Rams in time for the Superbowl.The aspect that saves this film from falling too far into sentimental gush or absolute unbelievability is the quality of the acting of the leads (particularly Warren Beatty, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, Julie Christie, James Mason, and Jack Warden as Max, the Rams' trainer) coupled with a fine screenplay. Everything is believable. Certainly the whole concept is just about as far-fetched as the Land of Oz, but you never contemplate that possibility for a moment. For some reason, everything works, and you run with it, not unlike "It's a Wonderful Life". As silly and fantastical as it is, the trip is well worth it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is a charm film, seeming to be the place where Warren Beatty hit his charm peak, learned how it was done and did it perfectly.Perfectly cast down to the servants, this film has some of the best scenes, with Buck Henry and James Mason in the closet ("Tell them I'm sorry, thank them"), the falling bed sequence, the servants on the staircase, Warren running around the house, the cigarlighting "I'm Joe Pendleton" scene, the hats, "have we met?" and,of course, the classic "let's be the goodguy company, the popular players." I could go on.At the end, where Julie Christie is realizing that Tom is Joe, her SKIN changes color. She FLUSHES.When Joe tells Buck Henry, "you're bad news", when Joe tells Mr. Jordan, "I love her, Mr. Jordan". "Can't something be legal and still be wrong?" A maid comes out on the croquet lawn with the badly hit ball!I'm sorry, but this film with it's brilliant comedy and beyond brilliant cast is so much better than "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", there's no comparison.This is one of my favorite films of all time. I love it. It's funny, it's charming, it's inspirational. This is why God invented Hollywood.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>...that stands the test of time. This was immediately one of my favorite films when I first saw it in 1982, at age 13. I decided to pick it up when I saw it's recent release on DVD and I am still not disappointed in the film. I am not a Warren Beatty fan by any stretch of the imagination, but this is a classic...and Charles Grodin comes very close to stealing the entire show. Highly recommended.The last 15 minutes of this film move the heck out of me, every time. I generally gravitate toward the "average" mark in rating movies, but this, in my opinion, rates a 9/10....I liked it quite a bit better than "The Deer Hunter", which won the Best Picture Oscar for 1978.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>1978 was a heavenly summer from Paramount.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>The Paramount mountain was certainly busy and flowing with cash in the late spring-summer months of 1978 with three box-office smashes: The Oscar Nominated Best Film "Heaven Can Wait", the screwball comedy "Foul Play" ("Kojak, Bang Bang!") and the musical blockbuster "Grease". I saw each of these films more than once during that summer, a transition time for me, and the memories come flooding back each time I see even a movie still or quick clip from any of those films. "Heaven Can Wait" is an excellent remake of an equally excellent 1940's classic, "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", changing the dead character from boxer to football player but pretty much keeping everything else the same.Robert Montgomery's boxer was killed in an airplane crash, coming back to earth due to the fact that an overzealous angel took him before waiting for the outcome. Warren Beatty's football player is bicycling through the Hollywood Hills and killed by speeding automobiles going through a tunnel. Escorted into heaven's waiting station by the same overzealous angel (Buck Henry), he insists that he doesn't belong there. Head angel Mr. Jordan (James Mason) discovers that indeed, he was supposed to arrive years later, and now they must find another body for him to return to earth in. More concerned with getting to the super bowl, Beatty turns down the variety of bodies he is given, and finally settles for a murdered millionaire whose wife (a hysterically funny Dyan Cannon) and assistant (Charles Grodin) conspired against. Now Beatty must not only get himself ready for the superbowl, he must also prevent his second demise which he tries with heavenly guidance.Julie Christie, Beatty's oft 1970's co-star, gives a light-hearted performance as a British activist out to prevent a nuclear plant from being put into her home town. Of course, that becomes a major plot point to get them together romantically and gives Beatty something more to do than just turn millionaire Farnsworth's mansion into a football training camp. In great support, there's Jack Warden as Beatty's former coach stumped by his "return", Arthur Malet and Joseph Maher as eccentric servants (having an amusing conversation concerning Beatty's constant meeting with the invisible angel James Mason in a closet) and Vincent Gardenia as the police investigator who exposes the crimes at Farnsworth Mansion.A great screenplay by Beatty, Elaine May and Robert Towne makes this delightful fantasy flow with witty dialog, and the co-direction by Beatty and Buck Henry keeps things at a light-hearted pace. This is a film definitely worth sharing with family, and one you will want to see again and again.</fullReview>

I was entertained.But it cannot touch the original. Maybe it's just because the story's original telling so matched what was in the public consciousness of the 1930's and 1940's.It was a good retelling. But perhaps it needed to be updated further in certain aspects of it's psychology?Anyway, I hope, if anyone plans yet another version, they mend this little complaint of mine.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A gentle and heart-warming fantasy comedy...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I finally saw the last of the five Oscar-nominated male leading performances from 1978, and although I'm still not sure about who deserved to win, and why Brad Davis wasn't even nominated for his performance in "Midnight Express", I admit that something deeply touched me in Warren Beatty's performance as Joe Pendleton, a Rams quarterback whose life was prematurely taken in a road accident. I don't know if it's in the eyes, or in the way he looked so young despite his 40's, but the sweetness and gentleness of his character made the film.Having only watched the remake with Robert Downey Jr., I thought Pendleton would reincarnate as a person and then realize who he was, while Beatty remains the same person, only using bodies as convenient media for his own personality, which is ethically acceptable, since all the bodies he takes would have been 'dead' otherwise. Joe only occupies bodies as settings for his own persona, illustrating the eternal philosophical connection between the body and the spirit. Now, I can't wait to see the original version by Ernst Lubitsch, with its evocative title : "Here Comes Mr. Jordan"."Heaven Can Wait" made me wonder: how I would react from the announcement of my own death? I guess more than from the loss of people I love, I would be sadder because of all the things I would never have the possibility to do again, to have totally annihilated my chances to be a specific person, to be whatever I wanted to be, and never having the chance to be something else. For Joe, it's the same disbelief tainted with a sort of child-like optimism, he's dead yet still believes he has a chance to achieve his only dream: playing in the Super Bowl. Joe's personality is the emotional core of the film as it embodies our personal vision of happiness: to be what we plan to be. It's all about our plans, and "Heaven Can Wait" tackles this issue with the constant idea that everything that is done is determined by fate, a plan made by an almighty entity.The film's most fascinating aspects lie between this incertitude of what is life and death, what is determined and what is natural, and Beatty's tactful direction never takes its message about life and death in a too depressing tone, keeping more in the tradition of Lubitch and Capra's films, and the hero's child-like attitude is compensated by the domineering presence of James Mason as a suave and comprehensive Head Executive aware of the bureaucratic mistakes that accidentally took his life. This point is crucial because it explains why I used the expression 'life was taken' instead of 'killed' and why Joe is given a second chance; he wasn't meant to be dead. And Joe is so good-hearted that he'll use this occasion to act positively, by taking the body of Mr. Farnsworth, an eccentric billionaire and controversial figure of the industrial world, a man whose life is targeted by his associate and wife, Charles Grodin and the Oscar-nominated Dyan Cannon, in irresistible comical performances.From a meaningful introspection in the concept of life and death, the film flirts with pure comedy through the switched-bodies formulas, and allows Beatty to shine as an altruistic person who'll almost redeem Fansworth for the sake of community, and whose only selfish motive would serve his dream to play on the Superbowl. This opens the gate to the two most poignant aspects of the story, the beautiful friendship with Corkle, Jack Warden as his coach and the growing romance with Julie Christie as one of Farnsworth's detractor, a British ecologist who'll be touched by the amount of generosity he'll suddenly display. Again, the on-screen chemistry between Beatty and Christie is perfect and the romantic bond growing between them is tactfully handled by a subtle and nuanced direction, combined with the villainous pair of Grodin and Cannon.But more than a romance, and a fantasy, the film also work as a great Sport film. In a interesting business meeting scene, Joe states his personal vision by comparing business with what he know best: football. This is crucial as it highlights his most endearing virtue: fair play. Joe doesn't do good actions because it's good but because it's fair, as it was fair that he would be allowed a second chance. Joe's second chance was also Mr. Farnsworth's second chance and then Tom Garrett's, one of his team-mates, if life is not to be taken for granted, neither is death. Fairness is the driver of the film, and something that elevate it beyond the level of a simple comedy, which makes us accept the idea that Farnsworth had to die, and that Joe couldn't live forever with his spirit in another body.This leads to a heartbreaking scene where the only one who knew Joe's secret, his buddy Corkle, realizes that Joe's spirit vanished, leaving him alone again with his souvenirs and his clarinet, Jack Warden almost made me cry and I'm glad his performance was recognized by the Academy. Then, Joe as Tom meets Julie Christie again, and he wonders if they haven't met. This very moment echoes a previous scene where he was aware that his days in Farnsworth's body were numbered, and then told her that she might find him somewhere in another form, and the ending gives a subtle idea of what the plan is about, and why sometimes, we can't help but having a feeling of déj? vu, or of having lived some situation in different eras.In a way, "Heaven Can Wait"'s ending is bittersweet because we must face the death of Joe's spirit, the only price for him to play in the Super Bowl. But I'm glad the film ended with the perfect touch, by leaving some hints that his gentle spirit didn't entirely disappear, in all fairness ?</fullReview>

His best buddy Max was played by Jack Warden (joins Beatty again in Bulworth). He was a laugh a minute. The lovely Dyan Cannon played the girlfriend Julia.Beaty also directed, along with Buck Henry (wrote The Owl and the Pussycat). Beatty also wrote the screenplay along with Elaine May (wrote screenplay for The Birdcage).Heaven can wait is a remake of the 40s film Here Comes Mr. Jordan.

		<shortDescription>Classy Remake Shines as Brightly as Original</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>A charming, stylish update of the 1941 film "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" that starred Robert Montgomery and Claude Rains, Warren Beatty's 1978 fantasy romance "Heaven Can Wait" is the rare remake that arguably equals or even outshines the original. Although fans of Beatty's work on "Bonnie and Clyde" and "Reds" may find this film a trifle by comparison, nevertheless, solid performances and a sharp screenplay by Elaine May and Beatty have kept this near classic fresh for almost thirty years.As Joe Pendleton, a quarterback who is snatched from his body before his time by an over-eager angel, Beatty is all good-natured charm, especially as Austin Farnsworth, the first replacement body that he tries on for size. Beatty surrounded himself with a great cast of supporting players. From the distinguished James Mason as Mr. Jordan, Joe's heavenly agent who works to rectify the error; to Jack Warden as Joe's friend and trainer Max Corkle; to the glowing Julie Christie as Joe's romantic interest, there is not a false note. However, the scene-stealers are Charles Grodin as Farnsworth's scheming, double-crossing secretary and Dyan Cannon as Farnsworth's unfaithful wife. Whenever these two are together, the film hits its comedy high notes.Directed by Beatty and Buck Henry, the film's production values are first class. The cinematography is lush, and the Oscar-winning art direction is well rendered. The Farnsworth mansion, which is an interior decorator's heaven, is a riot of floral prints and fresh flowers whose patterns and colors almost distract from the dialog.From "It's a Wonderful Life" to "What Dreams May Come" and "Defending Your Life" tales of heavenly visitors and after-death experiences are a popular genre, perhaps because they are reassuring and comforting. How can anyone fear death if there is a Mr. Jordan on the other side to greet you? The pain of loss is easier if a loved one might be nearby in the body of another. "Heaven Can Wait" plays to these sentiments without descending to sentimentality. As light entertainment, Beatty's take on the afterlife is about as good as it gets.</fullReview>

He (Warren Beatty, the quarterback) transforms a greedy rich semi-sane billionaire into a strong but good hearted person, based on love of football and desire to win the superbowl. The basic theme is that love can even conquer death. There are a lot of funny scenes, including using the butlers as his makeshift team, conferences with spirits from heaven in his closet, convincing his trainer that he's really not dead, they're all great.But the final scene where Julie Christie recognizes him as her true love ('You're the Quarterback!') always makes me sob!

		<shortDescription>Makes you cry, laugh, weep and have pleasure all at once</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I can truly say that I have watched this film tens of times and never get tired of it. A truly moving story which makes you laugh almost as much as you cry. The plot is well constructed and it is not possible to watch the last ten minutes without shedding a tear. Comic situations, romance, ecology, fantasy, the film is a savoury mixture of all these. It is only in the field of American Football that I was rather lost, as for a non-american, this game is totally incomprehensible ( after all what does 2-85 mean, they keep shouting that all the time ??? ).All the actors give magnificent performances and some very comic situations arrive. Of course, we are a little frustrated that Beatty has to lose his memory at the end, once he has reintegrated his definitive terrestrial body, but one look at Julie Christie and the mention of "quarter-back" sees off a happy ending to the film and so it should be. I love light fantasy films of this style and this one is a gem. The most moving passage is when Beatty as Farnsworth is trying to infer to Corkle that he is in fact Joe Pendleton and Corkle (obviously) think's he's crackers. Then Mason says, "try a little music" and Beatty plays Ciribiribin on his clarinet. The look on Corkle's face is at this moment unforgettable. In fact poor old Corkle is victim of events beyond his control like at the end when Beatty has forgotten his past in the changing room and Corkle, alone addresses him as Joe, and he looks at him in utter amazement. The look of incomprehension on Corkle's face is unforgettable. Unfortunately we don't get to see what happens to him at the end as the film pursues and ends with Beatty and Christie !! Anyway, the test of a good film is that you can watch it over and over again without getting tired of it . For me this film easily passes this test !</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A heavenly classic!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>When they make a movie you can call a classic, this is it! Warren Beatty rounded up a fine cast of actors and actresses to make this movie a real hit. Who says heaven doesn't make mistakes? Especially when a overeager angel who takes the soul of a promising football player(Beatty) without checking the outcome of his fate. Now searching for a replacement body, due to the angel's error, Joe Pendleton(Beatty) must find a body that is fit for him. I think a more fit body would be better since his knee was the most of his concerns. When Joe gets the body of a millionaire, he uses it to repair his past misdeeds. His murderers are his seedy wife Julia Farnsworth(Dyan Cannon) and his own partner Tony Abbott(Charles Grodin). Unknown to them, that Mr. Farnsworth is Joe Pendleton in his body, the guilt grows to the limit. Boy, this movie is much more fun than I expected. Warren Beatty football skills really paid off, too bad his soprano saxophone playing could use a little tuning. Other than that, the outcome of the movie is surprising, knowing that "Heaven Can Wait" for some people. Rating 5 stars. WAY UP!</fullReview>

Julie Christie glows in her part while Beatty more than handles his straight lines, with Charles Grodin (never funnier), Dyan Cannon, and Buck Henry all delivering the comic goods. A comic masterpiece with wonderful irony and a satisfying love story. ***1/2 out of ****.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Warren Beatty at his finest</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Heaven Can Wait is a milestone in Warren Beatty's long career. He produced, co-directed, co-written, and starred in this fantasy comedy of "probability and outcome". Originally Muhammad Ali was supposed to be cast for the role, but he turned it down, and it's a good thing he did. Beatty does a great job of handling the work of playing three different characters, as he goes from quarterback to businessman and back again. Warren also has great support from Julie Christie (whom Beatty worked with previously), James Mason (as the mysterious Mr. Jordan), Dyan Cannon (as the businessman's treacherous wife), Jack Warden (as trainer Max Corkle), Buck Henry (as the escort), and Charles Grodin. This film definitely deserved it's 9 Oscar nominations but it should have won more than one.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Entertaining, But It Fell Apart At The End</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I was really enjoying this movie. It was moving along at a good pace; I thought Warren Beatty was giving a good performance - and then the last twenty minutes threw in a plot twist that was totally unexpected (which would have been fine, except that it made no sense.) That, along with some illogical parts to the storyline, really brought this movie down a notch or two in my estimation.Beatty played Joe Pendleton, a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams who finally gets a chance to quarterback his team in the Super Bowl, except that heaven makes a mistake. "The Escort" (Buck Henry) wants to save Pendleton the pain of dying in a road accident and so plucks him out of his body before the accident happens. Unfortunately, Pendleton wasn't supposed to die in the accident but by the time the mistake is figured out his body is cremated, so he has to return to earth in the body of the fabulously wealthy Mr. Farnsworth. First problem. Everybody has a time to die. OK. It's bad that "The Escort" brought Pendleton to heaven before he was supposed to die. But isn't it equally bad that Pendleton gets to keep living through the lives of two people whose time was supposedly up? Seems to me that would throw everything off balance too. What if Pendleton as Farnsworth or the quarterback whose body he took over (and I have to confess that name escapes me) killed someone after their time was supposedly up? Seems to me that would create real problems. But the real problem for me was the ending.SPOILER AHEADWhy all of a sudden is Pendleton told that he won't be allowed to remember anything and will simply live as the quarterback whose body he took over? I thought the point was that Pendleton wasn't supposed to have died. But, in effect, heaven's Mr. Jordan (James Mason) kills him anyway by wiping away his memory when everything in the movie to that point suggested that he could keep living as Pendleton in someone else's body. I don't mind a plot twist, but that just made no sense to me.Anyway, the movie is entertaining in spite of those plot problems. I enjoyed Beatty's performance as Pendleton (knowing nothing about business) attending Farnsworth's company's Board meeting and completely changing everything the company had been about by convincing the directors to look at things "like a football game." That was quite humourous. Jack Warden was quite good as Rams' trainer Max Corkle, who tries to get Farnsworth's body into shape for the Super Bowl, and Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon and Julie Christie also offered good performances here.6/10</fullReview>

Joe takes on Farnsworth's body temporary as agreed by Jordan to help English environmentalist Betty Logan (Julie Christie). He changes his mind to stay as Farnsworth and buys his former team L.A. Rams. He convinces his former friend trainer Max Corkle (Jack Warden). All the while, he has to avoid the murder attempts from his cheating wife and accountant.Warren Beatty at his best is a great leading man. The duo of Grodin and Cannon is pretty funny as the bumbling assassins. I like the movie until the turn where Abbott kills Farnsworth. The humor seeps out of the movie. It gets sentimental. It's a good movie but it's not as funny as I hope. Grodin is the only one in the movie who is actually funny.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>He Still Cares about Football?</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie is a remake of another movie that was so dumb it should never have been made once, let alone twice. You might think the original version was "Heaven Can Wait" (1943), on account of the fact that it has the same title, but that is actually a different movie. Both movies with that title have something to do with dying and going to Heaven, and both movies are comedies that are not very funny, but that is about all they have in common. The present movie is actually a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" (1941).Now, all that one asks of a comedy is that it be funny. If it makes you laugh, that is all that counts, no matter how ridiculous the plot may be. But when a comedy is not funny, and yet it keeps insisting that you are supposed to be laughing at one silly scene after another, there is little one can do but think about the plot until it is finally over. In this case, the plot is exasperating. Joe Pendleton is a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams. He is hit by a car and is mistakenly whisked away to Heaven. It is discovered by Mr. Jordan, an authority in Heaven, that Joe was not supposed to die. Unfortunately, his body has already been cremated, so they have to find him another one to take its place.When Joe realizes what is going on, his big concern is whether he will be able to play football again. Football? He has just found out that all that stuff about God and Heaven is true, and he's worried about football? How could you possibly care about worldly goods when you know the secret of Eternity? Now, if I had just found out that I was in Heaven, I would be thrilled to discover that my soul was immortal. But if I subsequently found out that I was going to have to go back to earth in another body, my question to Mr. Jordan would be, "Is there a Hell, and if so, what do I need to do to stay out of it?" There is no more important question in this world or the next than that one.Assuming that there is a Hell, then having been sent back to earth in whatever body I was given, I would not be worried about football. I would immediately give all my worldly goods to the poor, turn the other cheek if struck, and absolutely, positively never look at a woman with lust in my heart again. Yeah, I know. At the end of the movie, Joe's memory of dying and going to Heaven is erased. But for the better part of the movie, he does remember all that Heaven stuff, and yet all he cares about is football (and a woman named Betty, whom he probably lusts after).As I said, if the movie were funny, all would be forgiven. Or, if the movie had been worthy in other ways, one might overlook this absurdity of caring about something like football when you know that Eternity hangs in the balance. For example, in the movie "It's a Wonderful Life" (1946), George Bailey finds out that all that stuff about God and Heaven is true too. Right then George should have said, "Oh Wow! That takes all the pressure off. Wait till I tell Mary the good news. Even if I do go to jail, everything will be fine when Mary and I die and we go to Heaven." He doesn't say this to himself, but we are willing to overlook the way George seems oblivious to his newfound knowledge of Eternity, because it is otherwise such a good movie.But "Heaven Can Wait," just like the original version on which it was based, is not a good movie, is not funny, and thus its preposterous plot deserves the ridicule I have just subjected it to.</fullReview>

You can understand why Joe wants to make sure he remembers her come what may. This is a great film that has mixed a hard concept of afterlife, a comedy, a sport film and of great romance.

		<fullReview>A remake of 'Here comes Mr Jordan', 'Heaven can wait' is a absolutely wonderful 1970's fantasy/comedy with a cast that really makes the movie. Warren Beatty in one of his best roles, is Joe Pendleton, a pro quarterback who unexpectedly dies while training for his football comeback. When he reaches the afterlife, he learns that there was a mistake and that he was taken too early. Unable to return to his old body, after it is cremated, a suitable replacement must be found. Entering the body of a wealthy industrialist murdered by his valet, Neil Farnsworth, Pendleton must decide what is really important to him, returning to football glory, or staying as Farnsworth to help a beautiful woman who comes to Farnsworth for help. The film is a treat. Beautifully shot, with soft lighting, and wonderfully acted by a GREAT cast including James Mason as the angel Mr Jordan, Charles Grodin as the murderous valet, Jack Warden, Dolph Sweet, Dyan Cannon, and the beautiful Julie Christie as Beatty's love interest. A filmed really tinged with sadness in its own way, but a beautiful love story, it should not be missed. Highly recommended.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Every ten years or so I dust this movie off and watch it again, always with someone new. Nobody's ever disliked it. Many have asked why they didn't remember it or know of it before. Look, I get the drift of other reviews, and that the 1970s were movie-making's golden age. I happen to agree that "Days of Heaven" is a better movie. "Days of Heaven" is a ten-star movie, absolute required viewing for any serious movie fan. Maybe nine academy award nominations were excessive, too. But, when younger viewers three decades on love the movie as well as I did, one must concede that "Heaven Can Wait" is something special.If there were an Academy Award for CASTING, this would be a shoo-in, and that's even more true if Cary Grant had been persuaded to play Mr. Jordan.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Jack Warden's tour de force</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" has many felicitous moments, foremost among them the performance of the half Jewish/half Irish actor, Jack Warden, as the trainer "Max," a role for which he was justifiably nominated for an Oscar for the best supporting actor. Warden is best remembered for his serious roles --he was one of the jurors in "Twelve Angry Man" and the editor in "All The President's Men" -- but he was a superb comic actor who in the tradition of all great clowns played the most absurd moments with the greatest seriousness. One of the funniest encounter scenes in all film, right up there with the great Jack Benny/Sig Rumann meeting in "To Be or Not To Be," is the moment in this film where Warren Beaty in the body of another man (Fransworth) tries to convince his old pal Warden that he is indeed the football player Joe Pendelton. Warden's reactions, his business with the cigarette lighter, and his final acceptance of Beatty's explanation are alone worth the time it takes to watch this slightly overlong film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty proves his potential &amp; confidence in his 1978 cult-classic 'Heaven Can Wait'. Though the second film adaptation of Harry Segall's stage-play of the same name, preceded by 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan', Beatty's 'Heaven Can Wait' yet comes across as entertaining &amp; sweet. It's a simple yet fictional story, told in a neat manner.Beatty stars in the lead role, playing a football player who, after being killed in a collision accident, is sent back to earth in the body of a millionaire.Screenplay by Beatty, Elaine May, Robert Towne &amp; Buck Henry, is engaging and packs in memorable moments. The second hour, however, is lengthy. Trimming needed to be done. Beatty &amp; Buck Henry's Direction, is quite good. Cinematography is perfect. Editing &amp; Art Design, are worth a mention.Performance-Wise: As told from the very beginning, Beatty is the Life of 'Heaven Can Wait'. The Veteran Actor sinks his teeth into the part, and is a treat to watch. He carries the film on his shoulders from start to end. Jack Warden is lovable. Dyan Cannon is hilarious. Julie Christie is nice. Charles Grodin does well. Others lend good support. On the whole, An Entertaining Film from the Late 1970's. Worth A Watch.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>This is one of my all time favourite movies. Nothing beats it when it comes to fun, light-hearted, feel-good humour and inspiration ... it was incredibly witty, superbly well-cast and perfectly executed, right down to the musical score. Although it's difficult to select from this cast of stellar performers, Jack Warden and James Grodin stand out in their convincing portrayal of the unique characters they brought to life. However, just like the Rams in the Super Bowl, this was a winning effort by a championship team!With its timeless concept unfolding in the setting (and feel) of the late '70s, this movie goes down as a classic in the historical context of movies in its genre(s). A well-made lighthearted film is, by its very nature, easy to take for granted compared with heavier dramatic fare, but it's arguably more difficult to pull off. Although this was a remake of the excellent 'Here Comes Mr. Jordan', I found that this version had its own originality -- it was uniquely entertaining, moving and memorable.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Humor and Great Acting Saves an Incoherent Story</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>We don't hear a lot about Warren Beatty these days. He's been away from from Hollywood for a decade now. But once upon a time he made and starred in amazing movies ? Reds, Bulworth, The Parallax View, Dick Tracy. Heaven Can Wait is a landmark in his career because it marks the first time he wrote, acted, directed and produced a movie. And it turns out it's a fun, good movie.Using the 1941 movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan as its basis, Beatty's movie tells the story of Joe Pendleton (Beatty), a football player who is taken to Heaven before his time. This bureaucratic mistake forces Mr. Jordan (James Mason), the heavenly director in charge of sending each soul to their final destination, to find a temporary body for Joe to inhabit while he looks for one that Joe can spend the rest of his life in. Things get more complicated because Joe died on the same day he learned he was going to play for the L.A. Rams, his greatest dream, and he wants a body that will be in shape for him to be in the finals.The movie gets going when Joe is put in the body of Farnsworth, a millionaire recently poisoned and drowned in the bathtub by his wife, Julia (Dyan Cannon), and his secretary Tony (Charles Grodin). Nothing beats Julia's reaction when she sees her husband placidly walk into the living room as if nothing had happened. Trying to kill him again becomes a running gag through the movie and Grodin and Cannon pull off hilarious performances as a pair of greedy, scheming murderers, paranoid about whether or not the millionaire knows they're trying to kill him.Putting a simple guy like Joe in the body of a millionaire also allows the movie to make some jokes about the business world. In a memorable scene, after inviting several reporters to a private meeting of stockholders, Joe uses football as a metaphor to how business should be run, leaving the stockholders completely baffled. Farnsworth's seedy businesses also brings Joe close to Betty (Julie Christie), an environmental activist. To the shock of his partners, he starts showing a lot of concern about the harm his company may be doing to people.All this strange behavior is usually chalked up to the eccentricities of a rich man. And there's nothing more eccentric than buying the L.A. Rams so Joe can play in the finals. After convincing his former trainer, Max (Jack Warden), that he's back, Joe starts training until fate intervenes again in a way he wasn't expecting.There's almost nothing wrong with Heaven Can Wait; that's not to say it's a great movie; but for what it tries to be ? a lovely fantasy comedy/romance ? it's very good. There's nothing pretentious or overly ambitious about it; Beatty and his crew and actors just want to make an entertaining movie and that's what it is. The chemistry between the actors never fails to be felt in each scene ? whether it be between the energetic Joe and the serene Mr. Jordan, between Julia and Tony in their murder plots, in Max and Joe's friendship, or in Joe and Betty's romance, the actors connect with and compliment each other instead of just delivering their lines.The movie has some storytelling problems towards the end: first events start being rushed to the finale instead of being given some room to develop, and then the finale contradicts the movie's premise. It makes the movie end in a pretty downbeat way, not that I dislike downbeat endings, but I prefer them when they come naturally. This imperfect note, however, isn't enough to ruin what is otherwise a well-acted and entertaining movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heaven Can Wait" is a remake of the 1941 movie, "Here Comes Mr. Jordan". I first heard about this 1978 fantasy comedy years ago, and although the story sounded very interesting to me, I never actually sat down to watch it until much later. I don't know exactly what I would have thought if I had seen the movie just after becoming aware of its existence (I believe I was in my early teens at the time), but when I finally watched it for the first time, I was reasonably impressed.Joe Pendleton is a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams. One day, while riding his bike through a tunnel, a vehicle crashes in there, and Joe soon finds himself in a mysterious place, walking beside a man he doesn't know! At first, he thinks it's just a dream, but he's wrong! The man is an angel who just removed Joe from his body, believing that Joe was about to die in that crash, and is taking him to heaven! However, this angel has made a mistake. He's new to this job, and has forgotten that he is only to remove humans from their bodies after they die, not when it just appears that they're about to die! It turns out that Joe was not meant to die until the year 2025, so Joe is taken back down to Earth to be put back in his body, but unfortunately, it has already been cremated! Now a new body for Joe must be found, the body of someone who has just died and no one knows is dead yet, and Joe will have to live as him! Although this movie may have its its fair share of slow-paced moments, which may reduce its quality somewhat, it's certainly not without its merits. There are enough funny moments in "Heaven Can Wait" for it to pass as a comedy, some fairly suspenseful moments and possibly sad scenes as well, and if you ask me, the performances from all of the cast members are nothing less than reasonable. So, if you want fast lots of action, you can't stand Warren Beatty, and/or romantic comedy fantasies are not your kind of story, then this movie obviously isn't for you. However, if you like any of those things, and can at least handle the others, then "Heaven Can Wait" might be worth watching.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty stars in this funny, bittersweet film about life after death. Beatty plays Joe Pendleton, a Los Angeles Rams quarterback who is accidentally summoned to heaven by an overly zealous angel fifty years before he is supposed to die.Desperate to return to the life he left behind, Joe and Heaven go on a quest to find a replacement body that Joe's soul can be deposited into. Joe wants a young, healthy body so that he can return to his career as a promising football star, but Heaven begs to differ and places him in the body of a Mr. Farnsworth, a fabulously wealthy and infamous corporate giant who was recently murdered by his cheating wife Julia (Dyan Cannon) and lowlife partner Tony Abbott (Charles Grodin, in a scene-stealing performance).At first, Joe requests that his time in Farnsworth's body be temporary, but consequently discovers that he must undo many of Farnsworth's past mistakes. More importantly, he comes into contact with Betty Logan (Julie Christie) and falls in love with her, thus complicating things much more than he first anticipated.This little gem from the '70s is a wonderful movie and will touch all those who take the time to watch it.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>At the beginning of the film, Joe Pendleton was the backup quarterback for the football team the Rams. He was very skilled at that sport and it lead him to start the next game. His luck had changed one afternoon and he never played in the next game. Joe had been in an accident and was killed before the big game. When he was waiting to go to his finial destination, he had found out that he was not suppose to die yet. He could not return to his own body because it had been cremated. He and Mr. Jordan, the person who took his body to early, started looking for a new body. Joe settled for Leo Farnsworth's body. Farnsworth was a very wealthy man but had a bad image. While in his body he experienced events that were bizarre. On many occasions his wife and her lover which was his secretary, tried to kill him. When Joe was in Farnsworth's body he built a relationship with Betty Logan. Betty was a teacher who had a problem with the company Farnsworth works for. Joe's goal in this movie was to find a body that was athletic enough to play for the Rams again. The movie is based on fantasy and has a little bit of comedy. The chemistry in the film between the actors gave a original feeling instead of it just seeming like a remake. Farnsworth character was the big corporate guy who did not care about other people's feelings. His wife was adulterous and planned to kill him along with his secretary. Betty Warren was the teacher who tried to protect her town. All of these characters played a major role in the movie and added humor to the story line</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Dated, but decent nonetheless...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a film, that you may have to really have an appreciation for the time from whence it came to really, truly appreciate.To put it simply, it is dated and this is right down to its core.Now this isn't always a bad thing. However as movies become more sophisticated, certain things like the soundtrack on this can really be taxing for the new generation.I'm sure there are numerous reasons for how certain aspects of change came about in film. For example, why did Martin Scorsese's "Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore" have such texture in its soundtrack when this movie, shot four years later has such a "Starsky and Hutch" feel, with perhaps an original score, but a dated, blah feeling nonetheless. It could be everything from budget to lack of cooperation of artists, to the simple matter of choice. Of course nowadays, it really shows. It was also standard fare at the time musically and "Alice" was just a very cool exception. Some movies like "The Cutting Edge," for example make use of the dated score with some original tracks on top, but this version of a done before, done again since movie sticks to the novel score. Okay, big deal.Outside of this simple fact it's a solid story with decent direction, not as much of a tear jerker as I'm willing to bet it would be today, excepting the Chris Rock version...and the comedy is dated as well.Probably the funniest part for me (and here's some spoiler) was all the uniforms that really had no tie to anything, prompting Beatty to ask "do I sail?" Every night that he showed up for dinner in a new and gaudier outfit, I sat and chuckled.All this aside, I think this is where the main criticisms may sprout today and this is simply not changeable. Still, fun, solid and though dated, still enjoyable. Women will swoon over Beatty's youthful good looks more than Christie, who was supposed to be the object of his affection. Gentlemen, just remember she was made to look frumpy and conservatively set. She was cast in a more sexy manner in other roles and if you hunt her down today, even with the added years she's still a looker. </fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A delightful movie with great characters</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I thoroughly enjoyed it. Since then, I've watched it several more times and each time I still enjoy it as I did the first time, even now that I know the ending.Ultimately it's a great story with wonderful characters richly played. Charles Grodin is fantastic with Warren Beatty playing his role in such an understated way that he really becomes totally believable as Joe Pendleton.Although young children won't likely understand the context of the subplots (murder and implied sex) or the subtleties of the movie, for the most part this is a decent family film. Although not as bad as most so-called family-friendly movies of today, there is one spot where some profanity is used, easily skipped if you know where to fast-forward.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Warren Beatty was about 30 and in his prime playing Joe Pendleton, conditioned athlete and star QB for the RAMS. During a training ride on his bicycle, he was pulled prematurely out of his body because it was thought that he would die anyway. But, upon finding that it wasn't really time yet for him to die, another body had to be found. It was old and wealthy Mr Farnsworth whom his cheating wife (Dyan Cannon) and his trusty assistant (Charles Grodin) had just murdered. But, if Joe was put into the body before it was discovered dead, Joe could go on living as Mr. Farnsworth, but only temporarily.As Mr. Farnsworth he is approached by many to rectify wrongs of his business enterprises, one being pretty Betty Logan (Julie Christie), who wanted him to abandon an enterprise in England which would displace a whole village of 1600 people. Farnsworth surprises everyone by being sympathetic. He also, as Joe, falls for Betty and, knowing his wife and assistant were cheating on Farnsworth, offered her a divorce so he could marry Betty.MOST SPOILERS FOLLOW. The plot thickens as Joe (as Farnsworth) hires his old friend and trainer (Jack Warden) to help him get into shape to try out as QB for the RAMS. Actually getting the tryout requires him to buy the team. But, just before the big game, Joe has to find another body, because he (as Farnsworth) is about to be murdered (again), this time by a gunshot to the head. As it turns out the actual QB is about to die on the field, Joe takes his body and wins the big game. However, that is his permanent body, so he will no longer have memories as Joe. When he meets Betty again, after the game, their eyes meet, they are not sure why but they recognize something in each other, they walk off together.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>How is it no one ever mentions that the 1978 movie was a remake of an excellent black and white version made in 1941? I saw the earlier version quite by accident on TV one slow Saturday and was struck by how much the later one resembled the original. While the 1941 film features Joe as a boxer and the later one as a footballer, the rest of the plot is virtually unchanged. While greatly admiring all participants in the 1978 movie, I do think some acknowledgment is vastly overdue. Old movies can be quite awe inspiring, especially when we remember how limited facilities were in those days. Viva old movies, especially those in black and white.

		<shortDescription>Here Comes Mr. Mason!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Remake of the 1941 classic about an athlete that is prematurely "taken" before his time only to end up looking for other bodies to occupy whilst he waits for the perfect body so he can go to the Super Bowl(it was boxing in original). This is a fine film and a fine remake. It is almost an exact duplicate of the original as far as the basic story goes, even using most of the names ver batim. What it does have that the earlier version does not is more exposition. In this one we get more in-depth characterization. This is clearly evident in the scenes between Beatty(who by the way does a fantastic job in probably his best role ever) who is in the body of a wealthy industrialist and his servants. The character has cocoa with his servants, treats them like men rather than servants, and this really underlies the whole heart of the script in this film. This film has great acting, just like its forebear. Beatty is very good, but acting honors really go out to James Mason as Mr. Jordan, Buck Henry as the blundering heavenly escort, Dyan Cannon as a murderous wife, Jack Warden as Max Corkle, and Charles Grodin in a very funny role as a personal secretary cheating on Beatty's rich body. The chemistry between Grodin and Cannon is very apparent. Buck Henry gives another low-key comedic gem of a performance. And what about Jack Warden? Will this guy ever get the credit he is due as an actor? For me though, James Mason steals the film as the heavenly Mr. Jordan, even outshining Claude Rains from the original. Mason is a class act all the way! This is a fun film with lots of heart and an underlying message about what being human is all about...or rather should be all about. I know many want to say its better or worse than the original. I like them both. If I had to pick...I would pick this over the original only because it is a funnier film and it has some great music. The score is done by Dave Grusin and it is original, creative, and memorable. Some of those tunes have stayed with me half my life now.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>One of Beatty's best performances. He shines as Joe Pendleton, a quarterback accidentally enraptured before his destined time. The supporting cast is almost too good to be true. James Mason, Jack Warden, Buck Henry, and Vincent Gardenia all expertly add to the riveting plot, while wide-eyed Julie Christie is romantically mesmerized against her better judgment by Beatty's surprising little boy openness as he puts his own spirit into a Scrooge-like mega-rich villain. Beautifully counter-balancing the more serious moments are Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon plotting mayhem.It's easy to forget that this film is a remake. The wonderful "Here Comes Mr. Jordan" from the forties, with Robert Montgomery, paved the way, and itself may have been a cover of an even older film.A hilarious comedy with the capacity to touch you and then to occupy a little corner of your heart always.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Films used to be made for adults.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Films like this used to get made a lot. It was mildly heavy here and there, but it was a kind of comedy that dealt into the "what if hereafter" genre. Beatty stars as a would all-star quarterback who is given a setback (of sorts). Mason heads up a small team of "helpers" who try to put him back on track, only they wind up screwing things up in an even bigger way.Things sort of work out, but to find out how you have to see the film. Julie Christie, Dyane Cannon, Jack Warden and Charles Grodin create an all star cast to bring to us the tale of a man who is waiting for the idiots who put him in his predicament the okay to move on.It's a kind of rebirth story, only Beatty's Joe Pendleton doesn't have any issues regarding his health or social stature. He is truly the victim of poor circumstance. This is a somewhat slow paced adult comedy. The jokes aren't fired at you from all quarters. The film actually lets you have some time to digest what is happening so you can better absorb and appreciate the situation presented.To me this is an adult film meant to be enjoyed by mature people. And by that I don't mean sex. I mean this is old fashioned film making telling a kind of old fashioned story of a man getting a second chance. You don't see films like this much anymore. Or rather all of the serious adult films these days are low budget artistic efforts, about affairs, or are filled with teenage raunch humor; i.e. kids and adults who stayed kids enjoy the big budget stuff these days. "Heaven Can Wait" was meant for a different audience for a different time. I miss both that kind of film making and that kind of audience. They will never return at this rate, but one can always hope.I'll reserve judgment on the personalities involved in this film. Each has their own set of problems in the limelight. But the art they've created here is worthy of viewing.Enjoy.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A Remake That I Liked For A Change!</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>In general for the most part I'm not a fan of remakes. But considering that this is a remake of "Here Comes Mr.Jordan" which is one of my all time favorites I like this movie a lot. Both movies are quite wonderful in their own ways. In this movie they chose to update it and made him a football player instead of a fighter and that works very well. They also expanded more showing him with the board and taking an active role in that and his simple comparisons to football are quite charming and have a certain wisdom to them. The casting in both movies are wonderful. But this movie some of the lesser roles were made bigger and cast better. Julie Christie really steals my heart in this movie. Evelyn Keyes was very good in the original movie but Julie Christie really took the role much deeper and is quite wonderful. Charles Groden and Diane Cannon as Tony Abbott and Mrs Farnsworth were also much funnier and stronger than the original actors. Both movies are quite excellent and I recommend watching both of them. I still prefer Here Comes Mr Jordan for it's light touch, charm and innocence, plus I love Robert Mongomery. But this is by far one of the best remakes of a great movie that I've seen. It's really worth seeing and goes beyond just being a remake and became it's own movie.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I found "Heaven Can Wait" to have some interesting turns, but it generally falls apart in the third act, most especially the too-muddled scene where Farnsworth's story is closed out and Tom's story gets rolling. Also, the foreshadowing of Farnsworth's last meeting with Betty is *much* too overdone.As a longtime fan of "Quantum Leap" who has only recently seen "Heaven Can Wait" for the first time, I was surprised to see how well this film fits into the mythos of that show.It is very easy to imagine Joe as a Leaper, right down to looking and sounding like Joe both to himself and to us, having friends he can talk to that others can't see or hear, and leaping from one body to another to set things right. It's easy to see the ending with Tom as answering the age-old question from the show of "What would've happened if Sam hadn't leaped when the job was done?" The only thing missing, really, is the time travel aspect.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>In between a silly role in "The Fortune" and his masterpiece "Reds", Warren Beatty made "Heaven Can Wait", in which he plays a football player who gets killed and then resurrected as a murdered businessman. I actually found much of the movie a little bit slow, but the scene where Beatty's character (as the businessman) meets with his business associates has to be one of the funniest ever to appear on screen, just because of how he puts it out. It amazes me that anyone could be able to remember that much information! Like I said, that's the best scene. Most of the movie is OK, not great, but still worth seeing. A whole lot better than Beatty's most recent outing (the god-awful "Town &amp; Country"). I should admit that I've never seen the original version of this movie, or the remake. Speaking of which, what do you call a remake of a remake? A threemake? Also starring Julie Christie, James Mason, Jack Warden, Charles Grodin, Dyan Cannon, Buck Henry, Vincent Gardenia, Joseph Maher, Hamilton Camp, Arthur Malet, Stephanie Faracy and Jeannie Linero.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Amusing romantic fantasy.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty is Joe Pendleton, a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, who is mistaken for dead, swept up, and taken to heaven's way station. Here, the error is discovered and two angels -- James Mason and Buck Henry -- take Beatty back to earth. It's too late. Because his soul was already taken away, the body of Joe Pendleton has died and been cremated. The only place the angels can find for Beatty's soul is the body of a filthy rich industrial baron, Mr. Farnsworth. Farnsworth's wife (Dyan Cannon) and confidential secretary (Charles Grodin) have drugged Farnsworth and left his body to slip farther down into the bath tub and drown.The angels intervene and place Beatty's soul into Farnsworth's body, which now looks exactly like Warren Beatty and has acquired Beatty's personality and -- wait. I know, this is getting confusing. The wind up is that everyone mistakes Warren Beatty for the mean and idiosyncratic Mr. Farnsworth. Beatty then finds himself in an utterly strange milieu and many amusing contretemps follow.Amusing, without being hilarious. It's a little funny to see Beatty the quarterback being fawned over by his obsequious servants, which include a perfectly bland and unflappable butler played by Joseph Maher. It's a little funny to see Beatty running around in confused circles while dressed as a polo player for no particular reason. But he really has only one funny line. When his board of directors informs him that their tuna-fishing nets sometimes snare porpoises but that he should pay no attention, Beatty asks, "We can PORPOISES?" (Actually, tuna boats now set "long lines" of a mile or so with baited hooks every few yards and they catch everything in the sea -- not just tuna and porpoises but sea turtles. The non-fish of course drown.) That whole ecological business was reportedly one of the things that attracted the activist in Julie Christie, who plays an outraged environmentalist who falls for Beatty. But the environmental material is submerged, so to speak, in a romantic comedy that is always interesting but only sometimes successful.Contributing to the humor is Jack Warden as "Joe Pendleston's" personal coach from the LA Rams, whom Beatty must convince of his real identity. Charles Grodin does well in the part of the quietly murderous secretary, and Cannon plays nicely on the edge of hysteria. In fact, all of the supporting cast are quite good. In some ways, they're the best part of the film.Many of the scenes were shot at the Filoli estate in Woodside, on the San Francisco peninsula. It has gorgeous gardens, of which we see a lot, and myriad copper beeches. The founder was the kind of philistine robber baron that the movie tries to make fun of. The mansion itself is an ivy-covered imitation of a British country estate -- except for its principal feature, a white bell tower that belongs atop a New England church. The owner had such an eye for incongruity that one wonders at the absence of an imitation Eiffel Tower. Unquestionably, his soul, which is now in that special place in heaven reserved for immeasurably wealthy robber barons, glows a little more brightly when it looks down on the miniature Sphynx of Las Vegas.Where was I? You know what struck me most about this movie on those occasions when my interest in the story waned? How much more acceptable it would have been if it had been in black and white and made in the 1930s. I don't know exactly what I mean by "acceptable" in this context, but try to imagine this. Take a silent masterpiece by Charlie Chaplin -- say, "The Gold Rush." Then remake it with somebody like Brad Pitt in the lead, and do it up right, in glorious Colossocolor, 6.1 track Dolby Digital Ex, boost the budget by a factor of one million, and then start shooting. It just doesn't jell, does it? Or does it.In any case, it's kind of funny and worth seeing but not really worth dwelling on.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Another Beatty Classic</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Always been a huge fan of Warren Beatty. This one definitely ranks among his other gems like Bonnie and Clyde, Reds, and Bugsy. These were not just well made movies, but they all consistently carried an inspiring message: it's not about whether someone realizes his dream but the dedication and inner fortitude throughout the journey in pursuing it. I enjoyed every moment in this movie from start to finish. I felt the same way when I watched it again recently on TV, truly a benchmark for all romantic comedies. [*** Spoiler Alert ***] The only little black mark for me is at the very end. When Joe Pendleton just learned that he would lose all memories and truly became Tom Jarrett, I felt cheated, probably the same way as Joe himself in the movie. But the final exchanges between Beatty and Christie was a great equalizer and provided a perfect ending to this great classic.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Worst. Ending. Ever.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This movie has the WORST ending of any movie I have ever seen, period. It totally ruins what was up until then a charming and entertaining fantasy movie and makes you want to throw a shoe at your TV for all the time you wasted watching what went before. There is no other way to explain this than to describe the ending, so again , , , SPOILERS BELOW!The ENTIRE movie centers around the effort to find a new body for the consciousness of Joe Pendleton (played by Warren Beatty), a QB for the LA Rams whose consciousness was mistakenly removed from his body many years too soon by a rookie angel who wrongfully assumed that he was about to be killed in an accident. The head angel, played by the great James Mason, takes over and finds the body of a freshly murdered millionaire to host Joe's consciousness temporarily, until a permanent replacement body is found. Eventually, the millionaire is murdered again, and Joe's consciousness is once again left without a home. However, Joe's backup QB for the Rams, Tom, "conveniently" dies during the Super Bowl, and head angel invites Joe's consciousness to inhabit Tom's body before anyone realizes that Tom is dead. Joe's consciousness inside Tom's body leads the Rams to a comeback victory, and is the Super Bowl hero.So far, so good.Then, the viewer gets a giant punch to the gut. The head angel informs Joe that he must return to his duties, and that after he leaves, Joe will have no memories of his life as Joe, or of his time in the body of the millionaire that he temporarily inhabited. He will just become Tom. The End.Huh?!?!? We just spent almost two hours watching a journey to find a permanent home for Joe's consciousness. And at the end . . . Joe's consciousness is totally obliterated for no good reason that is explained to anyone! Heck, if Joe had just died in the accident at the start at least his consciousness would now be in heaven. But after two hours of this movie, it is as if Joe never existed. And if the Tom, the backup QB, really dies and his consciousness is in heaven, then how can Tom's consciousness also still be alive in Tom's body, since the consciousness in Tom's body is now "just Tom," with no more traces of Joe remaining. What was the point of everything that happened in the movie?Answer: Zero. Which, if you are smart, is how much time you will waste watching this abomination.</fullReview>

This definitely is her best role in her young career at that point, and she makes me cry every time.

		<fullReview>'Heaven Can Wait' isn't a great film, but it is very good one and one of the best feel-good movies I've seen. Far better then Chris Rock's remake 'Down to Earth' (although that was still pretty funny), Buck Henry and Warren Beatty's 'Heaven Can Wait' has aged twenty-eight years, but still hasn't lost it's charm. Warren Beatty is excellent in one of his finest performances, while Julie Christie, James Mason, Buck Henry and especially Jack Warden are superb also. Beatty and Henry do a nice job directing this classic which was nominated for nine Academy Awards in 1978 including Best Picture, Best Director(s) - Beatty and Henry, Best Actor in a Leading Role - Warren Beatty, Best Adapted Screenplay and an undeserved in my opinion nod for Dyan Cannon for Best Supporting Actress for portraying Beatty's greedy slut wife. If you want a nice feel-good film, and don't mind some cheesy cinematography and an oldie from the 70s, give 'Heaven Can Wait' a chance. Grade: B</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Fine Warren Beatty-comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This comedy is about a quarterback who dies too soon. The fact that he died is the fault of a kind of angel. Warren Beatty plays the leading role in "Heaven Can Wait". Furthermore he has directed this movie and written the screenplay for it. You can see that the movie already has a certain age, but it did not disturbed me.Besides Warren Beatty is Julie Christie in this movie. This movie is enjoyable although I don't think every guy who's about 20 (like I am) would enjoy it. Recently I watched "Love Story". Although this movie is another 8 years older than "Heaven Can Wait", the latest mentioned looked the older."Heaven Can Wait" was also nominated for 9 Academy Awards, of which he only won one. It's a shame we don't have the chance to see more from Warren Beatty because he certainly is a true talent.</fullReview>

I was really impressed with Beatty. The only disappointment was Julie Christie who wasn't convincing as either an environmental activist or as a love interest. This was one of the best superbowl movies made. I particularly loved the scene where Beatty plays the rich new team owner who is trying out for quarterback and all the Rams keep intentionally sacking him offsides then apologizing "Sorry Mr. Pendleton, I didn't mean to crush you."Charles Grodin is hilarious as the scheming personal secretary who's cuckolding Beatty with his wife Dyan Cannon. When Beatty walks in on them, he talks non-chelantly to Grodin hiding behind the curtain, after he leaves Cannon asks Grodin why he answered, giving away their tryst. Grodin answered "I'm powerless to resist him". I don't know why this flick has had such bad press but I think it is great.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Remake of Robert Montgomery classic "Here Comes Mister Jordan" (Mister Jordan was played by Claude Rains). Here, James Mason is just as good as Rains, if a trifle too smooth. Buck Henry's officious escort, however, is no comparison to Edward Everett Horton, who played the same part with much more vim in the original. Perhaps Henry or Beatty wanted a distinctly different type, but Henry does not come off well.The main story-line goes, in case you don't know: Warren Beatty plays a football player who, at a late age (Beatty was actually 40) finally earns his dream start for the LA Rams football team. Unfortunately a heavenly escort (Buck Henry) removes the football player's soul from his body just before an accident (which he was supposed to survive without injury). So much for free will. In this movie, it's all laid out for us, folks.Beatty's football player is owed a body, after his own is cremated. Mister Jordan, apparently head of this heavenly branch office, shows him several bodies from athletic types on the point of death, but Beatty's character finds fault with all of them.Finally, Mister Jordan brings him to a body on the point of death who is not, technically, an athlete, though he must have a good physique. He's a rich guy whose wife and private secretary are trying to bump him off. Beatty is about to refuse when he suddenly gets the hots for a character played by Julie Christie. So long as the arrangement is temporary, Beatty's character goes along with the gig until a better body can be found.James Mason is excellent, Buck Henry is annoying, Warren Beatty never for an instant makes you believe he's anything but Warren Beatty. Beatty has found his métier with this movie. Always more a movie star than an actor, Beatty did light stuff better than heavy stuff, sort of like a pre-Bond Roger Moore -- though Moore's enunciation was a lot better. Rumor has it Beatty wanted non-actor Muhammed Ali for the part. If that is true, we're probably better off. And the change from a boxer to a football player was good. Who watches boxing anymore? For the rest of the cast, Dyan Cannon is gorgeous, Charles Grodin is weaselly (what else can we want from them?) John Gielgud, who does not appear in this film, is supposed to have said of Ingrid Bergman, who does not appear in this movie, "She speaks five languages and can't act in any of them." One might make a similarly catty remark of Warren Beatty's ex-flame Julie Christie.In "Doctor Zhivago" a decade and a half earlier, Christie merely had to look good on camera while letting Freddie Young's camera-work and Maurice Jarre's music do the heavy lifting. In this movie, Christie's frizzy hairdo can't save her. Apparently Kate Jackson turned down the Christie part. If this is true, it shows that she (or, to be fair, perhaps her agent) had absolutely no head for how to keep her career going after the "Charlie's Angels" jump-start. Too bad. I think Jackson might have been good.The only down side to this movie is the heavily-labored sub-plot. Liberals don't know how to have fun. There always has to be a "message" and the message always has to promulgate liberal dogma. To add to Christie's insanely miserable hair, her character is a rabid environmentalist with some cock-and-bull story of the rich guy destroying something or messing something up with one of his subsidiaries. So, in order to boost unemployment, she is determined to shut him down and be the planet's savior. Hoo-ray.Beatty, brother of the notorious left-wing nut job Shirley MacLaine, co-wrote the screenplay with former comedienne Elaine May; and he apparently couldn't just let it be a cheery little comedy about a dead guy trying to get a rich wastrel's body in shape for the big game after falling for a hottie. No matter how extreme an environmentalist one is (never trust anything ending in -ist), why not just have a sense of fun with a movie once in a while, and let the planet go to Hell for one hundred minutes? Of course, Beatty's next film, "Reds," glorified the founding of one of the most murderous tyrannies in modern human history (hey, kids, lets put on a show glorifying the burning of the Reichstag!) Even considering the very existence of Christie and her character, it's a fun move. And that is all it is. It's no great classic -- but then, neither was the original. Beatty did his take thirty-seven years after the original. It's time for a twenty-first century incarnation.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A fairly engaging fantasy comedy</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty is so likeable here it becomes easy to forgive any flaws this film might have. Indeed the entire cast is very likeable except of course for the villains who I thought could have been more entertaining if they had been asked to ham it up a bit more. The cast has a lot of big names besides Beatty. It's nice to see James Mason in a comic role since it proves his range as an actor. Jack Warden is always good as the friend (see The Verdict, Death on the Nile). Julie Christie's could've been larger but she does quite well the material given her. This film is not so good that you will remember it even a couple of weeks after you see it but it is a fairly entertaining pass time. I think Chris Rock remade this film a couple of years ago. Both versions are a solid two hours or so of entertainment. 7/10.</fullReview>

He even wants to be a pro quarterback. Nobody in the movie can figure out the reason for this dramatic change ... except the audience, which is what makes this movie so great.

		<shortDescription>Good romantic comedy/fantasy film but not worthy of 9 Oscar nominations</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>This is a good movie but the cast of Warren Beatty, Julie Christie, James Mason, Jack Warden, Dyan Cannon, Charles Grodin, Buck Henry and Vincent Gardenia must have had a lot of clout with the Academy of Arts and Sciences for this film to have been nominated for 9 Academy Awards because it's not that good. Nominated in most of the major categories including Best Picture, Best Director for Beatty and Henry, Best Actor for Beatty, Best Supporting Actor for Jack Warden, Best Supporting Actress for Dyan Cannon and Best Screenplay for Beatty and Elaine May as well as nominations for Best Cinematography, Music Score and for Art Direction for which it won it's solo Oscar. The Golden globes actually gave it their Best Picture, Best Actor for Beatty and Best Supporting Actress for Cannon, awards. Cannon deserved her Oscar and Warden was fairly nominated and William Fraker was also fairly nominated for Cinematography. This is a romantic comedy/fantasy that is a tribute to the romantic comedy fantasy films popular in the 1930's and 1940's and take it's character and basic storyline from the 1941 movie Here Comes Mr. Jordan and it's title from the 1943 movie Heaven Can Wait but Warren Beatty is not as romantically comedic as Robert Montgomery or Don Ameche were in their respective lead roles and he isn't as romantically comedic as he was in Shampoo. I saw this during it's initial release in the theater and have seen it a few times since and would give it a 7.5 out of 10.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>Soft-sell star-vehicle goes flat...</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Warren Beatty is surprisingly eager-to-please as a pro-football quarterback whose soul is taken out of his body too soon after an accident; with angelic assistance, he's put into a new body (that of an overweight billionaire) but he's on borrowed time. The film, a remake of "Here Comes Mr. Jordan", is all soft-focus warmth and good will; it tries setting up some wild comedy--the billionaire has a murderous spouse with a weaselly lover--but it all falls apart in the final quarter. The concluding events in "Heaven Can Wait" are so impossibly bungled, I was flabbergasted Beatty and company allowed the picture to get away from them. In a desperate need to wrap things up with the proverbial bow, the film becomes a benign love story with hardly any inspiration and no real point beyond the obvious softening of Beatty's star-profile. The screenplay is sadly insensitive to Jack Warden's football coach, who is left sitting alone in the locker room, and never allows love-interest Julie Christie to ingratiate herself to the viewer (she's extremely chilly). A huge box-office hit, but one which treads no new ground. ** from ****</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>One of the most mediocre of all Best Picture nominees</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>One of those films whose Oscar success (nine nominations, one win) makes you go "huh?" It's a middling comedy starring, directed, produced and catered by Warren Beatty. It's not a remake of the Lubitsch film, but rather Here Comes Mr. Jordan. Beatty, an NFL quarterback, is about to die, and an overzealous angel takes him to Heaven too soon. To compensate, an angel played by James Mason puts him back to life in the role of an eccentric millionaire, and he meets Julie Christie. He's married to Dyan Cannon, who, along with her lover Charles Grodin, is trying to kill him. There's some funny stuff here, but it's never laugh-out-loud funny. About the only selling point is Beatty, who is as charming as always. He can't carry the meager movie, though, and he didn't deserve his Oscar nomination for it. Nor for his directing. Nothing in the film is Oscar worthy. Cannon is shrieky and unfunny, Jack Warden, who plays Beatty's former coach, does nothing whatsoever. The score is okay, and the cinematography is unremarkable, and, what the Hell, the one it won was Best Art Direction. For what? 1978 is not a bad year for cinema, but, holy cow, with those five Best Picture nominees, The Deer Hunter really does look like a masterpiece. They seriously overlooked Days of Heaven for Heaven Can Wait, An Unmarried Woman and Coming Home? What bullcrap!</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>I don't know why this is such a popular story.</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>After seeing Chris Rock in Down to Earth, I wanted to refresh my memory of Heaven Can Wait -- as both movies are remakes of Here Comes Mr. Jordan. So Hollywood has made at least 3 films with the same plot, changing only what the main character's vocation is. The 1941 Jordan works the best but it had major flaws in plot and sense. And those flaws are carried over into both remakes. (One is the cheating of the main character -- he is not himself and can't remember anything at the end -- what a bummer!) I won't go into the Hollywoodization of Heaven -- as it is so absurd as to boggle the mind. In essence, the story is simple-minded and lacks charm, and has a lot of meanness in it and ends on a sour note. It should never have been made once, let alone 3 times! The worst thing about this first remake is the cutesy-poo music score -- sounds like it goes to a kid's nature flick. The second worst thing is Julie Christie's permanent (or is that supposed to be an afro?). The third worst...well, that's enough! This movie is just lame.</fullReview>

We never really know much about Joe Pendleton, and Beatty never falls into character; I was very conscious of the fact that it was just Warren Beatty with a different name.The story is silly, but even though it's moderately entertaining, it doesn't entertain as much as it should.

		<shortDescription>Heaven Can Wait, But Hell CAN'T (Something Was Really Wrong With The Whole 1970s !)</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>I liked : The elegant cinematography. The risqué white dress of (Dyan Canon) which she wore at the dinner scene (too too sexy to say the least !) and the fact of her being in it. (Julie Christie) in all of her scenes. The last scene in which (Beatty) holds (Christie)'s hand through the dark to see his face suddenly. The cute memorable music of (Dave Grusin ), especially the main theme. The suit of (James Mason). The authentic poster. And that's it !Actually the rest of the movie is whether weak or unfunny. Although (Beatty) made finer movies as an actor or director, but he is the last human on earth to be in a comedy (so how about directing one AND starring in it too !). Moreover, I didn't like that script. It's inane at parts, slightly comic at others. The whole first accident is hollow and fabricated just to put (Beatty) into another personality. The irony of the main situation is wasted and chilly. Speaking of which, along with the old axiomatic fact of (Warren Beatty) as dead-meat- cold, I didn't understand (Mason)'s coldness ?? The great man looked like a talking corpse more than an angel ! Maybe being under the direction of (Beatty) it's ordinary to transform into dummy.. Sorry, let's say marionette !I don't get it. The whole plot isn't that good in the first place, and they made it poorly too ??, the irritation becomes more and more with another remake later (Down To Earth), soon they'll have (No Heaven For You : The Tragedy of Sluggish Filmmakers !). I read once how the 1970s was "The dumb decade" ! I loved that very much. But I was confused. Why the 1970s has this bad reputation? Maybe it had been considered to have a lot of bad movies, fashions, and music (which I loved the most by the way). Like all the original definitions for : cheesy, chintzy, campy, or crummy were there. I think after the end of the 1960s there was a case of strong concussion all over everything. And everybody wasn't sure about what was already assured. Therefore let us change it all. With a lot of revolution and confusion. Consequently a lot of formulas lived a prerequisite, not always very successful, change. Some movies just played to be wholly another thing like European early work. Other movies were affected with the sudden success of the late 1960s' unusual some kind of realistic hits. And some ? very miserable ones ? tried hardly to make, or remake, the old glossy formulas yet unproductively and sketchier. Just review the number of the good genre movies from the 1970s that you've watched to grasp what I mean. The production of Disney is a perfect example. Anyhow the phoenix revived again, another equilibrium has been established, and the inauspicious decade was gone.Here, it's the old movie, the old movies. I think (Beatty) after some sexually bold movies at the start of the 1970s wanted a good introduction for the family audience. But even if he made it with a cartoon lead instead of him, sure it would've been livelier however still the steel "traditional" frame is surrounding it with more silly, less imaginative spirit. To look eventually like the white steam of the angels' airport : weakly shining, and obviously fake. Heaven can wait, but hell CAN'T, and that goes to (Beatty)'s hair cut, and inanimate face.P.S : If you know what was more wrong with that decade, just E-Mail me.</fullReview>

		<shortDescription>A very so-so affair</shortDescription>
		<fullReview>Joe Pendleton is an American football quarterback with a Super Bowl contending season ahead of him regardless of his age. However when he is out riding his bike one day, an impatient driver seems to spell the end for him. So back do things look that his angel escort decides to take him to heaven a few seconds early to avoid the pain of death. However it transpires that the angel acted to soon and Mr Jordan's records indicate that Joe wasn't due for many decades yet. With his body cremated Jordan tries to find another body for Joe to inhabit. They settle on Leo Farnsworth, a millionaire businessman who has just been murdered. He causes a lot of confusion in bringing the man back from the brink of death, however he keeps his goal of playing in the Super Bowl.Remade from the 1941 film and updated to include American Football as the sport in question, this retains a plot that really needs pace and charm to make it work. Instead, this version delivers it in a rather slow and heavy fashion that has a vague sense of the comic but not enough to really grip or win me over. The narrative asks a lot of the audience and doesn't help itself by being overly clunky where it should have been slick and smooth. The romance element is the biggest evidence of this as it expects us to go with it even though there is nothing to it that deserves my interest. The comedy is never laugh-out loud funny but rather it just plods along with a vague awareness of its own silliness. It will annoy many viewers because it is so light and lacking but it maybe has enough to carry an undemanding viewer.The cast are a mixed bag. Beatty does the basics but gets by on his natural charm. Christie is mostly weak and I didn't have any interest in her character at all. Grodin easily dominates the film with a wonderfully slippery character that draws all the laughs and interest. He is well supported by Cannon who has little screen time but plays her character well. Mason is class in his usual way but really adds little other than his name while Jack Warden does just what you expect him to do albeit quite well.Overall then, this is a solid enough comic melodrama but nothing special. The material is enough to carry it for the running time and the cast do they best they can but this is a very average affair and not worth too much of your time unless you are looking just to fill time.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>The movie, not to be confused with the 1943 one of the samename, is a remake of the 1941 classic Here Comes Mr. Jordan which I saw on PBS a few years later but that's another review. In the beginning we meet Joe Pendleton, (like the clothing line,) a quarterback for the Los Angeles Rams, (this was back when the Rams were in Los Angeles and the Cardinals were in St. Louis,) who has a chance to quarterback his team to the Superbowl. He also has a hobby. He plays the clarinet to calm himself down. One day Joe's out riding his bike when he's involved in a minor traffic accident with a ruthless millionaire. Unfortunately, Joe dies in the accident, but he wasn't supposed to. An overeager angel took him to heaven before his time. He meets the head angel, Mr. Jordan. Mr. Jordan says that he has to be returned to earth. Buttttt there's one major problem. He doesn't have a body to return to earth in. What happened? His body was creamated.. What's an angel, or for that matter, a disembodied quarterback, to do? He has to bereturned to earth. Those are the orders from the Man Upstairs. That brings about another problem. How can he return to earth? Promblem solved. There's a body available. That of the sameruthless millionaire who almost killed him the first time. It seems that his wife and accountant, whom the accountant was banging, had killed him to get their hands on his money. So when Mr. Nasty comes back to life, they're surprised. He then says that he wants to buy the Rams so he can lead them to the Superbowl. As Joe iswalking up the tunnel into the Coliseum, he's met by Mr. Jordanagain and told that they'll see him again on the date he wasoriginally scheduled to die on. As he takes the field, you see his clarinet on a stool.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Coming to the IMDb site to review this commercially successful movie, I was amazed at the Oscar recognition it garnered in 1978 for what is, to my eyes and ears a very unremarkable re-make of the enjoyable 1941 Claude Rains feature "Here Comes Mr Jordan", while surreptitiously grafting on the title of another "life after death" 40's classic starring Don Ameche.I just don't have a lot to say about this vapid entertainment other than apart from transforming the hapless Joe from a boxer to an American footballer (and thus losing some of the universality of his character), it seems almost a line for line, scene for scene, inferior copy of the much superior original. Buck Henry and Elaine May were celebrated comedic writers of the time but I found nothing laugh-out-loud funny in what I saw and heard. The cinematography is merely average, soft focusing around Beatty &amp; Christie's love scenes while the acting gig for all must have been the easiest payday they ever earned. Beatty plays every scene either with bemusement or winsomeness, Christie couldn't even be trusted to adopt an American accent and so we're expected to accept her Transatlantic-hopping English rose character who wins Beatty's heart with one flutter of an eyebrow or flick of her over-permed hair. Add to that the great James Mason seeming to sleepwalk his way in Claude Rains' bigger footsteps, Dyan Cannon in permanent histrionic mode and a cast of many along for the ride. The Oscar nominated score is all sappy MOR muzak too.I've read that Beatty made this film with one eye on the box-office returns to fund his ambitious "Reds" project, a film I'll be watching soon and hope was worth it. For me this particular movie just demonstrates however the schmoozy, lackadaisical, condescending work which came out of late 70's LA Hollywood studios.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>I really don't understand the schmaltzy sentimentality over this clunker. I thought it was terrible when my cousins dragged me to see it back when I was 7 years old; I just saw it again at age 32, and it hasn't improved with age. Beatty was wooden as ever, Christie is a fawning mess, and... heck with it, I'm not going to waste more of my time. ZERO out of *****.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Below average movie about Reincarnation in a light romance comedy style.The directing,cinematography and screenplay was below average.The script was merely average.Too bad because there was a good story here and also very talented actors.Warren Beatty also was in his prime and looked very good for the part he had.The acting effort was below average though probably due to the inept directing skills of Beatty.This movie tends to be over rated particularly by big fans of Reincarnation and similar subject matters.This subject matter is a good story foundation but this is not a basis for over rating a movie that does not deserve a good rating,so for people who have not seen this movie and are checking it's reviews,beware of a LOUD MINORITY who give this one a CLASSIC rating.Only for big fans of the Reincarnation type stories and big fans of the lead actors.....</fullReview>

		<fullReview>Spoilers herein.Master Beatty has four interests, and one way of dealing with them all. The interests are politics, sex, movies (not `cinema'!), and football. Here, he succeeds in combining all four, though all the casual sex is among the players not the characters.His one way is to charm by patter while moving. It is a technical matter of timing that has its origin in athletics, quite different than a similar timing acquired by a dancer like Shirley. But he is good at it, here and in all of his projects.Here, his friends Buck and Elaine keep him out of trouble. But what they bring is competence in designing skits. So that's what we have: a few skits strung together. This is TeeVee, not film.</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heaven Can Wait" attempts to turn "It's A Wonderful Life" into a football movie. The trouble is that the film doesn't feel like a sports comedy; the sports element and the coming back from heaven and taking someone else's body element are two distinctly different entities that Warren Beatty's film tries to squeeze together. One does not necessitate the other and as such the film takes forever to follow a common thread and by the time the humor works and the film somewhat gets itself together, it's too late.How this film was nominated for nine Academy Awards absolutely baffles me. Rarely do I hold contrarian opinions to the Academy, but "Heaven Can Wait" is simply not worthy, especially the writing team of Beatty and Elaine May, who while clever and funny fail structurally speaking.Quickly into the film, Los Angeles Rams' quarterback Joe Pendleton (Beatty) finds out he's going to be the starter for his Super-Bowl bound team, but dies in a nasty accident -- or does he? Turns out one of heaven's "escorts," (not the definition you're thinking of) who was responsible for pulling Joe out of his body when he died, did so too early when it turns out Joe would've survived the accident. Remorsefully, the escort and Mr. Jordan (some heavenly guy in charge played by James Mason) agree to give Joe another body to make up for it, a body Joe hopes to get into football shape and use to play quarterback again.But it's not that simple. The body Joe chooses (he can only select a recently deceased and undiscovered body) belongs to corporate billionaire and supposed scumbag Leo Farnsworth whose wife and personal assistant are having an affair and tried to kill him. The film dawdles in the corporate affairs of Farnsworth for far too long, thinking the situation funny when the character's goal is to play football and our desire is to see him pull it off, not try and improve on Farnsworth's life. We are given no reason to think Joe would actually care to use Farnsworth's body to mess with Farnsworth's affairs, but he does and football disappears from the story for a chunk of time.That's when Julie Christie is introduced as Betty the love interest, which is poor because she's not attached to the football element, which is supposed to be the main part of the story, hence how disjointed and poorly composed the script is. Some of the writing is indeed humorous and well-done, especially with Farnsworth's butlers as well as Charles Grodin and Dyan Cannon playing the two people that just plotted to kill him trying to rectify the situation now that he's alive. However, those scenes are such a far turn from the initial football set up that the humor is limited because the script is going off in a dissatisfying direction. Perhaps I had the wrong set of expectations, but I think most people will feel oddly deceived at the direction the story goes in."Heaven Can Wait" tries to do too much and the talents aren't strong enough to make up for the elaborate script. Beatty's a likable actor, but the story draws Joe up as unconvincing because his motivation is so distorted. Creativity and originality, which "Heaven Can Wait" certainly doesn't lack, are terrific qualities in films, especially in a genre as cliché-ridden as sports comedy, but the execution is everything and "Heaven Can Wait" from a writing standpoint was a botched attempt.~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com</fullReview>

		<fullReview>"Heaven Can Wait" flirts with a nice idea: Joe, a quarterback, (Beaty) dies in an accident, but as he goes on his way to heaven, a chief angel (Mason) agrees that he was brought erroneously there and must be brought back to life. However, things become complicated when they discover that this is not feasible anymore as his body has been cremated, so after some extensive body-searching, he comes back as a millionaire who has just survived a murder attack. As he tries to fit into his new life, numerous unorthodox things happen, including a series of renewed murder attempts...Witty as the plot may sound, the film unfortunately fails to deliver completely. It just doesn't work out, as a clever idea develops into a completely boring and predictable story. The performances are average; ditto the direction. Moreover, do not expect any fancy visual and audio effects (after all this was year 1978). Perhaps the film made an impact in its days, but today it can by no means get a pass grade. 4/10.</fullReview>
